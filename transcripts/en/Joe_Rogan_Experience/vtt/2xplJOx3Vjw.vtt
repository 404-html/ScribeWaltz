00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Let's get home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Ha what's up dude?</v>

2
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on your shirt.</v>

3
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:11.350
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a lot going on there.</v>

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.203
<v Speaker 1>We take a penguin with shark teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my homage to Albert Hoffman in </v>

5
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>the creation of LSD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.230
<v Speaker 1>In shirt form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.064
<v Speaker 1>well that's Hoffman talk with Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ and then you use all these crazy </v>

8
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>animal parts for squares and I'm full </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden blowing out of his head.</v>

9
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that a road runner can eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fucking rattlesnake?</v>

10
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's gangster.</v>

11
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>There's a video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody tweeted it to me the other day.</v>

12
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way this is real,</v>

13
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:37.344
<v Speaker 1>but it's 100% real road runner hunts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed a fucking rattlesnake and then </v>

14
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.323
<v Speaker 1>eats it and it's eating this thing like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way bigger than it and it's just </v>

15
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>trying to swallow it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've no idea how gangster,</v>

16
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's a hard runner.</v>

17
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Identifies as a pterodactyl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he does.</v>

18
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>

19
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you really get a good,</v>

20
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>you look at them from a distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It a little bird.</v>

21
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>You're a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not worried about you,</v>

22
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.673
<v Speaker 1>but when you look at them like close up </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this and it's high resolution </v>

23
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:04.764
<v Speaker 1>photography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize like how fucking predatory </v>

24
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>these birds are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

25
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>look that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the snake takes a lunge at him.</v>

26
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

27
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not today.</v>

28
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Snap gets them right on top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking head.</v>

29
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>And look how he does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

30
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>He smashes his head against the rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

31
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people discovered the dinosaurs </v>

32
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>were probably birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's even more terrifying.</v>

33
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.533
<v Speaker 1>I a hundred percent believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told you the story about my </v>

34
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:31.141
<v Speaker 1>chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>With the feed the mice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

36
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.883
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is really bizarre </v>

37
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.073
<v Speaker 1>because it just shows you how like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have these attachments to a </v>

38
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>certain species for no reason.</v>

39
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Like a Steven Nela talks about it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears.</v>

40
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>He calls him charismatic Megafauna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about 60.</v>

41
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>So eloquent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

42
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:53.544
<v Speaker 1>when he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:54.783
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

44
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.913
<v Speaker 1>he's right though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like something about bears that </v>

45
00:01:57.571 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>make some very different in our eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any other animal and birds,</v>

46
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>they have these hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this hawk flew into my fence.</v>

47
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I have a glass fence hog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know what the fuck is going on.</v>

48
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.873
<v Speaker 1>Boomp kod jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My daughter's rescue the bird and then </v>

49
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>they go to the pet store and buy little </v>
<v Speaker 1>pinkies,</v>

50
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>which are these little tiny mice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they feed them to the hawk.</v>

51
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>So they feed this little tiny mouse had </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided the mouse is not as important as</v>

52
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>the hawk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Hawk has stay alive.</v>

53
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.073
<v Speaker 1>Fuck these little baby mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they feed the baby mice to the </v>

54
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>hockey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all of them.</v>

55
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>But one my daughter went to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I said,</v>

56
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:32.880
<v Speaker 1>you can't keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to die.</v>

57
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>It needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>it needs to have milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just feed it to the chickens.</v>

59
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.900
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of hemming and hawing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of crying.</v>

60
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to the mouse to stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

61
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Ft just fed 30 of them to this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur majestic hawk.</v>

62
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.153
<v Speaker 1>It's flying monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I bring it into the chicken coop </v>

63
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.453
<v Speaker 1>and I mean I put that thing on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground for not even one half of one </v>

64
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 1>second and they were tearing it apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>and running around with it.</v>

65
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>It was their monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That rotor thank just confirms</v>

66
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 2>that I've to 100% new respect for birds </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

67
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

68
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 2>it is interesting how people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

69
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 2>you think about bears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

70
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.710
<v Speaker 2>And people have love bears since way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way back for like teddy bears.</v>

71
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.153
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before there was the internet and these </v>

72
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.314
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just certain animals that you </v>

73
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:19.774
<v Speaker 2>have this kinship towards and certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>like sacred animals when you're down in </v>

74
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:22.804
<v Speaker 2>the jungle and different places that </v>
<v Speaker 2>always seem to inspire something within </v>

75
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.140
<v Speaker 2>mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:30.350
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know why it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

77
00:03:30.351 --> 00:03:31.184
<v Speaker 2>I think I just sort of accept it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't feel the same way about </v>

78
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 2>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do about deer.</v>

79
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 2>I think deer are wild and they're cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I love that they exist.</v>

80
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 2>But I have a much more predatory feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>around them than I do around bears.</v>

81
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:47.010
<v Speaker 2>Bears are like this weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

82
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can eat them too,</v>

83
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

84
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

85
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have the same feeling.</v>

86
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:56.851
<v Speaker 2>And as an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this insane reality of what they</v>

87
00:03:58.031 --> 00:03:58.864
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this enormous like wild dog thing that </v>

88
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 2>can kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of them are just giants,</v>

89
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 2>just gigantic wild dog thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can kill you and we'd love them.</v>

90
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.923
<v Speaker 2>I remember sitting in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously we were out there with the </v>

91
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:13.414
<v Speaker 2>bears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sitting there in the woods and </v>

92
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 2>watching them screw around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

93
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.580
<v Speaker 2>it's something different for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's at least in,</v>

94
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 2>especially too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're kind of looking at you like</v>

95
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 2>the connection of looking at the bear </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the bear looking at you.</v>

96
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

97
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:26.840
<v Speaker 2>It's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When a deer looks at you,</v>

98
00:04:26.841 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh dear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks at you like,</v>

99
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:28.803
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you doing that's </v>

100
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 2>inside?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the bear looks at you like,</v>

101
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.223
<v Speaker 2>hey man.</v>

102
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what doing here.</v>

103
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.233
<v Speaker 2>That's what's the different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a different whole thought </v>

104
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:37.984
<v Speaker 2>cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes think of thoughts like the </v>

105
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:39.784
<v Speaker 2>small wheel and the big wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like bears are just on that </v>

106
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 2>slightly bigger wheel like us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

107
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.790
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

108
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 2>That's gotta be a big part of what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

109
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:49.084
<v Speaker 2>Like we almost inherently recognize that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a level of understanding </v>

110
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:55.780
<v Speaker 2>that's above the undulates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

111
00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:57.790
<v Speaker 2>like there's something about those </v>
<v Speaker 2>omnivores.</v>

112
00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 2>There's like a level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially them,</v>

113
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 2>there's a level of understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>

114
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:05.500
<v Speaker 2>like if you see how they behave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is a thing,</v>

115
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.423
<v Speaker 2>especially about grizzly bears that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got out of that grizzly man movie is </v>

116
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:10.474
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so almost robotic in their </v>

117
00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 2>predatory drive and their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their drive to survive.</v>

118
00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:17.770
<v Speaker 2>There's survival drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

119
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 2>just moving around looking for stuff to </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat all the time.</v>

120
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are so big,</v>

121
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 2>you have to eve teach so much when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're that big.</v>

122
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.183
<v Speaker 2>But the advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of hiding all of the food that </v>

123
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 2>you need for the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a squirrel,</v>

124
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.883
<v Speaker 2>you ease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat and eat and eat and nobody's going </v>

125
00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 2>to take your food from you cause it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just fat on your body.</v>

126
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Like the only way to get that fat is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight the bear.</v>

127
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:41.254
<v Speaker 2>And nobody wants to fight the bear so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can survive the winter a whole </v>

128
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 2>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a cool way to approach it,</v>

129
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 2>but a bizarre way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so fascinating when you see all the</v>

130
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:50.734
<v Speaker 2>different methods that nature's figured </v>
<v Speaker 2>out to sort of overcome the obstacles </v>

131
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>that the environment can throw at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's animals that</v>

132
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 1>can survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the ocean,</v>

133
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.861
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

134
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:01.694
<v Speaker 1>we were snorkeling and I'm looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and all these turtles and all </v>

135
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>these fish and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they live here?</v>

136
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.123
<v Speaker 1>They fucking live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can only stick my head under </v>

137
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 1>there for a few seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come up,</v>

138
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 1>I got to spray water on the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nozzle.</v>

139
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.343
<v Speaker 1>They fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a living thing surviving in </v>

140
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:18.224
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like life has found a bunch of </v>

141
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:20.504
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird ways to get along and a bear was </v>

142
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 1>one of the weirdest ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get fat as fuck.</v>

143
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>They get big round in Jelly and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's take a nap.</v>

144
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck this winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

145
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not stupid bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I a moose?</v>

146
00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to walk out there and freeze </v>
<v Speaker 1>to death like an asshole.</v>

147
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to sleep like there's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy involved in that.</v>

148
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 1>It's so much deeper than the strategy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other animals,</v>

149
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.350
<v Speaker 1>the other animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the pig.</v>

150
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:52.010
<v Speaker 1>One of the big things with I guess a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deer cause they fucking freeze to death,</v>

151
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:53.570
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they went up dying.</v>

152
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

153
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 1>you wonder as that evolves that whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>hibernation pattern.</v>

154
00:06:58.791 --> 00:06:59.624
<v Speaker 1>If they're just like taking a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>naps first when that's the fellow and </v>

155
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.420
<v Speaker 1>then f one bear like sleeps two weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the other bears.</v>

156
00:07:06.421 --> 00:07:07.191
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

157
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:11.720
<v Speaker 1>That was awesome and it just sleep a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit longer all the time.</v>

158
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck does that take place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of those really dumb,</v>

159
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 1>like people who don't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

160
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Art are arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're telling me,</v>

161
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.660
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me that's not by design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on dude,</v>

162
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 1>because somebody who's posted a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guy posted a video,</v>

163
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:30.620
<v Speaker 1>like an animated Gif file of the flat.</v>

164
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.020
<v Speaker 1>He was a flat earth guy and it was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>

165
00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Speaker 1>like a flat plane there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even high resolution.</v>

166
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:39.830
<v Speaker 1>It was like low resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was flat and he's like,</v>

167
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:41.360
<v Speaker 1>show me again the curvature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

168
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 1>oh my God dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

169
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 1>people are fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.873
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that whole people just want to </v>

171
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:52.820
<v Speaker 1>get a leg up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.000
<v Speaker 1>and everything you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just trying to edge someone out.</v>

173
00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 1>So if you can believe in flat earth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually is flatter,</v>

174
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.410
<v Speaker 1>you got a little bit of leg up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else's shit.</v>

175
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:04.244
<v Speaker 1>The Globe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

176
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.910
<v Speaker 1>So they're willing to take that gambit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're willing to place that place that</v>

177
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:08.840
<v Speaker 1>bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck it man,</v>

178
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm flat earth.</v>

179
00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Cause if I'm right and I can say fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to everybody else just a little bit.</v>

180
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:14.973
<v Speaker 1>That's the ego.</v>

181
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.960
<v Speaker 1>That is the ego I have to do is watch a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple youtube videos.</v>

182
00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:22.190
<v Speaker 1>You'd be convinced if you don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else other than that,</v>

183
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.463
<v Speaker 1>like that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Jordan Peterson talking about </v>

184
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 1>how we could all become a Nazi guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we can all believe in flat earth if</v>

185
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:32.660
<v Speaker 1>we just stretched our mind a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a little bit more,</v>

186
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe all is the wrong word for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi guard or flat earth,</v>

187
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.060
<v Speaker 1>but I think they could get a lot of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could get.</v>

188
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:41.894
<v Speaker 1>A lot of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told you the story about those </v>

189
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 1>fucking rod things that I thought were </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

190
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.470
<v Speaker 1>I thought there was rods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever heard her?</v>

191
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:49.304
<v Speaker 1>Roswell rods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those little w they're supposed to be </v>

192
00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 1>insects that are flying through the sky </v>
<v Speaker 1>so fast.</v>

193
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>You can't even see him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way to pick them</v>

194
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 2>up with his video cameras and only way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to actually see them.</v>

195
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.410
<v Speaker 2>So they would find them on these videos </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

196
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you even notice this a time?</v>

197
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.093
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they decided that there was these </v>

198
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 2>gigantic things that could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

199
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:09.894
<v Speaker 2>who knows how many feet long and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like jellyfish and they fly through the </v>

200
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:13.920
<v Speaker 2>air like fucking lightspeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

201
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.583
<v Speaker 2>it's those stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out what it was is just an </v>

202
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.133
<v Speaker 2>artifact when you film things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you film things with Shitty old </v>

203
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 2>cameras and when they have new cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

204
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 2>that's the Rod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that thing.</v>

205
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a twig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they look like.</v>

206
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 2>And some of them you see like way up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sky.</v>

207
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:30.624
<v Speaker 2>Some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a bug that's flying so fast </v>

208
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.500
<v Speaker 2>that the camera can pick it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

209
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.940
<v Speaker 2>So the camera makes it look like that.</v>

210
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.990
<v Speaker 2>Like that last one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

211
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

212
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.480
<v Speaker 2>See how it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a jellyfish.</v>

213
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.100
<v Speaker 2>We've been through the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a video art or like a Bat with</v>

214
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 2>a vapor trail for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah it does.</v>

215
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:47.850
<v Speaker 2>That's that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

216
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:50.850
<v Speaker 2>Cause that one's in front of the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes you see them in the sky so</v>

217
00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:52.750
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a outside of reference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

218
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.603
<v Speaker 2>You know you don't have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one's interesting because it's in </v>

219
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:57.030
<v Speaker 2>front of the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the trees just only,</v>

220
00:09:57.031 --> 00:09:58.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few yards away you can tell.</v>

221
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 2>And if that rod things right in from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tree,</v>

222
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:02.700
<v Speaker 2>you can get a guesstimate on how big it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

223
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.460
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of the videos of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had them in the sky,</v>

224
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just flying in the sky for,</v>

225
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.690
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's 16 feet long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's flying.</v>

226
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.533
<v Speaker 2>The speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Sedona just having lunch and I </v>

227
00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:17.610
<v Speaker 2>was in Sedona is a place where there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>some cool shit and then there's a lot of</v>

228
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:18.444
<v Speaker 2>wacky new age shit there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was listening to this guy just </v>

229
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 2>talk about orbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

230
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Like these orbs and he was able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>capture,</v>

231
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.860
<v Speaker 2>I've seen those on film and I've had </v>
<v Speaker 2>orbs in photos and stuff.</v>

232
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.130
<v Speaker 2>All it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the,</v>

233
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 2>it's the lens flare effect that creates </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

234
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like super into the science of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

235
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:39.810
<v Speaker 2>but I know that I can reproduce it if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>create a lens flare and the thing,</v>

236
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:41.250
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be an orb somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the picture.</v>

237
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:42.084
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

238
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.340
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way they were describing it,</v>

239
00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:45.174
<v Speaker 2>it's like this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go out it at the right time at </v>

240
00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:51.630
<v Speaker 2>dawn in this special place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be orbs on the ground.</v>

241
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like where they gather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

242
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:55.020
<v Speaker 2>no bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the sun come out.</v>

243
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.750
<v Speaker 2>And every time it creates a lens flare </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your camera,</v>

244
00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.780
<v Speaker 2>you know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love it if it was that though.</v>

245
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.673
<v Speaker 2>Why is such a party pooper?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plenty of be amazing if like you could </v>

246
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:06.354
<v Speaker 2>find balls of light through your round </v>
<v Speaker 2>you like little like organisms are </v>

247
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.760
<v Speaker 2>lifeforms and like if you were more </v>
<v Speaker 2>loving,</v>

248
00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:12.594
<v Speaker 2>they surround you do and you just had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a picture of people and tell </v>

249
00:11:14.671 --> 00:11:15.720
<v Speaker 2>whether or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

250
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:16.563
<v Speaker 2>it's studes awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the seeds from a Wa just kind of </v>

251
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:23.880
<v Speaker 2>like zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were all just floating all around.</v>

252
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I would deal with that feeling that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see it was a camera,</v>

253
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

254
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.743
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo had one picture was it was </v>

255
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:33.774
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of orbs around them and he had </v>

256
00:11:35.221 --> 00:11:38.490
<v Speaker 2>his hands open like this and the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>orb was in his hands.</v>

257
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:40.050
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

258
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.393
<v Speaker 2>imagine if we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just imagine if we're all just super </v>

259
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:48.800
<v Speaker 2>skeptical and we're ignoring something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say fucking real.</v>

260
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a camera auto fact.</v>

261
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:52.410
<v Speaker 2>It's reproducible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go back.</v>

262
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.940
<v Speaker 2>I sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

263
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.833
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's kind of like once you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done enough Iowasca and done enough dmt </v>

264
00:11:59.051 --> 00:11:59.884
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you open yourself up to the </v>

265
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:01.894
<v Speaker 2>possibility that there are things </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially outside of our ability to </v>

266
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 2>perceive them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Eddie,</v>

267
00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:08.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

268
00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:10.690
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like he's holding it.</v>

269
00:12:10.691 --> 00:12:14.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like you got high enough to see it </v>
<v Speaker 2>before I have his girlfriend spitting on</v>

270
00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:18.280
<v Speaker 2>the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get some more herbs.</v>

271
00:12:18.281 --> 00:12:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Gulen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like could you recreate orbs?</v>

272
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:22.870
<v Speaker 2>It's spit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>

273
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 2>if you were going to believe in orbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be,</v>

274
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would,</v>

275
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.930
<v Speaker 2>that'd be the one that I'd go with </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole.</v>

276
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

277
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.940
<v Speaker 2>He's got to know his hand can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's clearly a balancing his center,</v>

278
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.940
<v Speaker 2>his love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be the shit if it was real.</v>

279
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like all these things would be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

280
00:12:38.561 --> 00:12:41.260
<v Speaker 2>If they were real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's some ufo videos over Turkey</v>

281
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:42.940
<v Speaker 2>and I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even click.</v>

282
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I you even click on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how blahzay have gotten about the</v>

283
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:46.294
<v Speaker 2>UFO or deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't because I don't believe you </v>

284
00:12:48.311 --> 00:12:50.290
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not clicking on it.</v>

285
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love it if it was real.</v>

286
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the weird thing about real,</v>

287
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:56.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

288
00:12:56.351 --> 00:13:00.940
<v Speaker 2>it's like when you go see something was </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a vivid imagination,</v>

289
00:13:00.941 --> 00:13:03.190
<v Speaker 2>like especially in like the psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>

290
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:06.490
<v Speaker 2>you see something and then there's that </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate,</v>

291
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.120
<v Speaker 2>like is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

292
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.033
<v Speaker 2>And then if enough people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if enough people have seen it or </v>

293
00:13:11.231 --> 00:13:12.220
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people believe in it.</v>

294
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Like dragons for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like are they real or not?</v>

295
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:16.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're clearly not in three d space,</v>

296
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.063
<v Speaker 2>but everybody knows and has emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactions to this one being and they </v>

297
00:13:21.341 --> 00:13:23.680
<v Speaker 2>come to you envision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what is that?</v>

298
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Is The dragon real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

299
00:13:24.711 --> 00:13:26.260
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your definition of real?</v>

300
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.311
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

301
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:30.550
<v Speaker 2>is it the collection of an idea in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain?</v>

302
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 2>All of the lights gathering around that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can share and reproduce.</v>

303
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 2>And then that thing comes through like </v>
<v Speaker 2>an archetype in your brain.</v>

304
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Like it's the archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many of them,</v>

305
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:43.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the Chinese Dragon,</v>

306
00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:46.390
<v Speaker 2>the Japanese Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Gothic Dragon.</v>

307
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

308
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.363
<v Speaker 2>the Medieval Look Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many different ones are there </v>

309
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.670
<v Speaker 2>feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dragons videos,</v>

310
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.613
<v Speaker 2>infinite dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly slight variations on the </v>

311
00:13:56.051 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 2>dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

312
00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:58.840
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's,</v>

313
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.790
<v Speaker 2>it is an archetype of being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them,</v>

314
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.740
<v Speaker 2>they've come to me many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times always.</v>

315
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.470
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the being of ultimate power,</v>

316
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.270
<v Speaker 2>like a being of supreme power.</v>

317
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.980
<v Speaker 2>And that's the archetype that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommends.</v>

318
00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:12.730
<v Speaker 2>There's no animal in the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hierarchy that trumps the dragon.</v>

319
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.590
<v Speaker 2>And he shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody shut the fuck.</v>

320
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:15.693
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes flying in with fire coming out </v>

321
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:18.514
<v Speaker 2>of his face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody just settles down this giant </v>

322
00:14:20.981 --> 00:14:23.320
<v Speaker 2>flying Lizard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A con blow fire.</v>

323
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it represents that kind of power.</v>

324
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.090
<v Speaker 2>My Tattoo artist actually got a cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

325
00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:28.924
<v Speaker 2>It's like I never tattoo a dragon </v>
<v Speaker 2>snarling because no dragon would ever </v>

326
00:14:33.491 --> 00:14:35.860
<v Speaker 2>need to snarl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's nothing he would point,</v>

327
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.060
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dragon,</v>

328
00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roar at kind of a snarling,</v>

329
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it is that being of fucking </v>

330
00:14:43.691 --> 00:14:44.524
<v Speaker 2>supreme power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a strange thing that there's so </v>

331
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:50.380
<v Speaker 2>many different cultures that have sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of captured that.</v>

332
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 2>And you've got to wonder</v>

333
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.000
<v Speaker 1>how many different things when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing from the fossil record,</v>

334
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we know of birds exist,</v>

335
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:02.810
<v Speaker 1>who knows how many things existed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we just haven't found yet.</v>

336
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.003
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible that some weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking lizard existed at some part of </v>

337
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:09.710
<v Speaker 1>the world and people could say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:14.711
<v Speaker 1>some weird snake thing that walked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the legend spread of that.</v>

339
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:17.210
<v Speaker 1>And then people saw a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant lizards.</v>

340
00:15:17.211 --> 00:15:18.044
<v Speaker 1>Like if you saw a Komodo Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were just wander through the </v>

341
00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:23.750
<v Speaker 1>jungle and you saw a full size Komodo </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon and had its mouth open,</v>

342
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.410
<v Speaker 1>you would for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

343
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.250
<v Speaker 1>In the presence of a demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ran away from that,</v>

344
00:15:28.251 --> 00:15:29.150
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no cameras,</v>

345
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:30.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No cameras.</v>

346
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Got To take things from your imagination</v>
<v Speaker 1>and drawing for people.</v>

347
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.183
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to draw?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna draw goddamn demon hissing </v>

348
00:15:37.431 --> 00:15:41.900
<v Speaker 1>giant lizard with saliva coated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>botulism.</v>

349
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Those are horrible monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

350
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Those are fucking ruthless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruthless predatory lizards.</v>

351
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Giant lizards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you would draw them.</v>

352
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.090
<v Speaker 1>They would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would be,</v>

353
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have wings.</v>

354
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you are just a primitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

355
00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:59.120
<v Speaker 1>you ran into one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she ran into a Nile Crocodile,</v>

356
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a video up,</v>

357
00:16:02.301 --> 00:16:04.220
<v Speaker 1>a one Jack and it vulture does he that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

358
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.210
<v Speaker 1>This vulture fucked up and got too close</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this lake.</v>

359
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.400
<v Speaker 1>They Jack everything except for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hippo.</v>

360
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Don't see the crocodiles Jack in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hipaa.</v>

361
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still clean.</v>

362
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.160
<v Speaker 1>They stay clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how he gets him.</v>

363
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just boomed bitch.</v>

364
00:16:18.021 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Just out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck at Uhmm.</v>

365
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Gimme that chicken just jumps right back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there with them.</v>

366
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right under the water.</v>

367
00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:26.444
<v Speaker 1>What a what a creepy animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lives in this place where you can't see </v>

368
00:16:30.141 --> 00:16:32.240
<v Speaker 1>it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Brown water,</v>

369
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.160
<v Speaker 1>fucking brown water and they can hide in</v>
<v Speaker 1>three feet of that shit for like hours.</v>

370
00:16:37.161 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to come up and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear the vibrations.</v>

371
00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:43.080
<v Speaker 1>They know where you are and they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>jump up and chat to you.</v>

372
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.003
<v Speaker 1>I think so much of the way that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed was to try and avoid that </v>

373
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:52.820
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck our soft bodies.</v>

374
00:16:52.821 --> 00:16:53.654
<v Speaker 1>You know all of this brain activity that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have so much of it you after credit </v>

375
00:16:56.991 --> 00:16:59.660
<v Speaker 1>towards avoiding that exact fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>

376
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well hence the like the stereotypes that</v>

377
00:17:03.081 --> 00:17:05.090
<v Speaker 1>the stronger the person dumb or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

378
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.810
<v Speaker 1>you know like if you have time to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that muscle bitch,</v>

379
00:17:08.811 --> 00:17:11.070
<v Speaker 1>you ain't got time to read any books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

380
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.003
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learn and what that soft dude over </v>

381
00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:14.360
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to save us.</v>

382
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:16.163
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's over there doing physics and shit </v>

383
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.313
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how to make swords.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your bench press will not help the </v>

384
00:17:20.991 --> 00:17:23.990
<v Speaker 1>asteroid collision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be a big one.</v>

385
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.500
<v Speaker 1>That was the creepiest podcast we did </v>
<v Speaker 1>last week for sure.</v>

386
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaked me the fuck out again.</v>

387
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:32.923
<v Speaker 1>It's too easy to not think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too easy to just not think about </v>

388
00:17:36.201 --> 00:17:37.034
<v Speaker 1>the variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too easy to not pay attention to the </v>

389
00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:39.524
<v Speaker 1>fact that we really are just a species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's clinging to a spaceship without a </v>

390
00:17:43.971 --> 00:17:48.971
<v Speaker 1>roof that were just clinging to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>circular orb as it a thousand miles</v>

391
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 2>an hour and hurls through infinity or we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were just hanging out on it and we don't</v>

392
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:56.610
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to think about it.</v>

393
00:17:56.611 --> 00:17:58.920
<v Speaker 2>It's due grazie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

394
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:03.780
<v Speaker 2>The depressing part of that whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>cataclysmic particularly is we're,</v>

395
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.360
<v Speaker 2>we got all these fucking nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactors everywhere,</v>

396
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.433
<v Speaker 2>so like one goes off and then those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things get all disrupted and then the </v>

397
00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 2>nuclear radiation is the big issue that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to worry about.</v>

398
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:15.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see what they did to Chernobyl?</v>

399
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.530
<v Speaker 2>They created a dome that's two football </v>
<v Speaker 2>fields long.</v>

400
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.993
<v Speaker 2>It's gigantic and they're getting case </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire enclosure plus the astro </v>

401
00:18:25.621 --> 00:18:27.150
<v Speaker 2>realm of led on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

402
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:28.980
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>

403
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:31.980
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy engineering undertaking.</v>

404
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.020
<v Speaker 2>If you look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

405
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.913
<v Speaker 2>Like you just have to imagine like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of resources and how many brains </v>

406
00:18:38.191 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 2>were involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this thing.</v>

407
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:44.810
<v Speaker 2>They're going to lift this fucking thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the dome is this enormous.</v>

408
00:18:45.271 --> 00:18:49.560
<v Speaker 2>They have these designs for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They show the fully competed thing fully</v>

409
00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:51.350
<v Speaker 2>completed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it say there?</v>

410
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.660
<v Speaker 2>30 countries are involved in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

411
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

412
00:18:56.191 --> 00:18:57.024
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

413
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:57.863
<v Speaker 2>the key is we've got to elevate </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness to a point where we're </v>

414
00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:02.690
<v Speaker 2>actually looking at these situations and</v>
<v Speaker 2>being able,</v>

415
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.860
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's the point that Graham</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Randall make.</v>

416
00:19:04.861 --> 00:19:07.840
<v Speaker 2>And I couldn't agree more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people have to be at a,</v>

417
00:19:07.841 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 2>at a level where we can actually do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about that instead of fighting</v>

418
00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 2>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're 100% right.</v>

419
00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Look at that image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's going to look like.</v>

420
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.350
<v Speaker 2>They're just going to drop that down </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the site.</v>

421
00:19:18.351 --> 00:19:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Like Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's big and so big.</v>

422
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.280
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy how big it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look how thick it is.</v>

423
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.840
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

424
00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:29.280
<v Speaker 2>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck does that way?</v>

425
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.440
<v Speaker 2>And the weird part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

426
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:33.780
<v Speaker 2>it just feels to me that it's not fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to work.</v>

427
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Just like putting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

428
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.090
<v Speaker 2>putting like a tupperware over a Fart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

429
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:38.933
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you going to get the whole part in </v>

430
00:19:40.321 --> 00:19:41.790
<v Speaker 2>the tupperware?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I doubt it.</v>

431
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I think the farts out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

432
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:49.020
<v Speaker 2>Shane Smith went down there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in trouble and they were,</v>

433
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:49.854
<v Speaker 2>they were hunting these wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's these radioactive wolves </v>

434
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.773
<v Speaker 2>episode.</v>

435
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.750
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

436
00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:58.923
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these animals that live around that </v>

437
00:19:59.881 --> 00:20:01.380
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all radioactive.</v>

438
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

439
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.090
<v Speaker 2>it just hulks out and turns green.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

440
00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:08.580
<v Speaker 2>they probably are experiencing some </v>
<v Speaker 2>mutations.</v>

441
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:09.623
<v Speaker 2>There was some viral video that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going around the Internet that was </v>

442
00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:12.264
<v Speaker 2>saying that these are fish that lived </v>
<v Speaker 2>near Chernobyl and it showed these just </v>

443
00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:15.984
<v Speaker 2>enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy fish slopping around this little </v>

444
00:20:17.851 --> 00:20:20.190
<v Speaker 2>river and they were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the vial.</v>

445
00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:23.370
<v Speaker 2>But apparently it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they're just giant catfish or</v>

446
00:20:23.371 --> 00:20:26.040
<v Speaker 2>something like that that just do exist </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some spot.</v>

447
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.040
<v Speaker 2>They're not radioactive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is deep in our psyche though.</v>

448
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:29.874
<v Speaker 2>That idea that radioactive matter is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to turn something into some </v>

449
00:20:34.171 --> 00:20:36.070
<v Speaker 2>amorphous new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

450
00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:37.800
<v Speaker 2>And it's always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always bad.</v>

451
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.120
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except in comic books,</v>

452
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.130
<v Speaker 2>if you're a dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a dude,</v>

453
00:20:41.131 --> 00:20:42.270
<v Speaker 2>it always works out well.</v>

454
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.660
<v Speaker 2>He always become spider ran or the hulk </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

455
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.790
<v Speaker 2>you just got to pick the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go into that radioactive soup with.</v>

456
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.710
<v Speaker 2>That's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

457
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to get a good deal.</v>

458
00:20:52.061 --> 00:20:53.790
<v Speaker 2>Like the stretchy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the guy?</v>

459
00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.200
<v Speaker 2>The and the avengers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the vendors.</v>

460
00:20:56.201 --> 00:21:00.340
<v Speaker 2>The fantastic four stretching guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a shit fucking superpower.</v>

461
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.750
<v Speaker 2>That is shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

462
00:21:01.751 --> 00:21:02.584
<v Speaker 2>you get to bend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get to stretch you out like </v>

463
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Taffy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking,</v>

464
00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:06.844
<v Speaker 2>where do I sign up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to go in with a road runner for </v>

465
00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:10.570
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

466
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 2>he's got a guy next to him and it turns </v>
<v Speaker 2>into fire.</v>

467
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Like what the Fuck I get?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can.</v>

468
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.950
<v Speaker 2>This guy can turn into fire and fly </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the fucking hair.</v>

469
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:18.963
<v Speaker 2>All I can do is stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the most bullshit superpower of </v>

470
00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:25.720
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could stretch.</v>

471
00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.750
<v Speaker 2>He makes his arms go into circles.</v>

472
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.540
<v Speaker 2>He could turn them into a figure eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>

473
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:32.583
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fought with Dawson and street fighter </v>

474
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 2>and his stretchy ability was definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>helpful.</v>

475
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.320
<v Speaker 2>Does he have stretchy ability?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is pretty fine.</v>

476
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.333
<v Speaker 2>He could push both his arms out like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and they go away in front of the </v>

477
00:21:42.281 --> 00:21:45.130
<v Speaker 2>shoe and the leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just straight double Dick Punch and then</v>

478
00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:46.990
<v Speaker 2>he's got that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foot like that,</v>

479
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.710
<v Speaker 2>like a long ass front kick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone out of the sky crowd to say,</v>

480
00:21:50.711 --> 00:21:53.500
<v Speaker 2>I can't name any of the characters in </v>
<v Speaker 2>street fighter,</v>

481
00:21:53.501 --> 00:21:56.500
<v Speaker 2>nor can I tell you what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about that.</v>

482
00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:57.880
<v Speaker 2>I played that a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

483
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.060
<v Speaker 2>this is the old man that hit me right in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sweet spot and I couldn't,</v>

484
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just at that age,</v>

485
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.150
<v Speaker 2>you know where you have all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone brewing but the frustration</v>

486
00:22:07.151 --> 00:22:09.100
<v Speaker 2>because we little and you couldn't beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody up,</v>

487
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:09.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

488
00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.100
<v Speaker 2>So you just play something in a video </v>
<v Speaker 2>game and then you can beat everybody you</v>

489
00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:12.934
<v Speaker 2>up if you're that avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how many fights have been </v>

490
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:18.340
<v Speaker 2>started from street fighter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if there was like a running tout.</v>

491
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Mcdonald's has.</v>

492
00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:21.094
<v Speaker 2>How many burgers sold?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many likes fights started by a game </v>

493
00:22:24.041 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 2>of street fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less than Madden for sure.</v>

494
00:22:26.441 --> 00:22:27.274
<v Speaker 2>Less than that because I see right </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing that and it often ends in </v>

495
00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:30.370
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

496
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.360
<v Speaker 2>That should be a whole youtube channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Madden street fights.</v>

497
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:40.120
<v Speaker 2>They should come with some gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dudes love their flip all man.</v>

498
00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:40.993
<v Speaker 2>They love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to bill birth podcasts and </v>

499
00:22:42.221 --> 00:22:44.650
<v Speaker 2>sometimes he'll go like an hour just </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about football.</v>

500
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.590
<v Speaker 2>They fucking told us we couldn't do it.</v>

501
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Who told you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

502
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.113
<v Speaker 2>us as the US is the funny thing too </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that's again like the identity </v>

503
00:22:58.121 --> 00:22:58.954
<v Speaker 2>playing this trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that that lust for tribalism that </v>

504
00:23:01.211 --> 00:23:03.070
<v Speaker 2>we all have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we want to be part of a tribe.</v>

505
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.083
<v Speaker 2>Oh that team is our tribe and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight for it and you'll feel shitty </v>

506
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:09.130
<v Speaker 2>about it and you'll feel elated about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

507
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:10.183
<v Speaker 2>I mean it makes the Games interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also opens you up to a weird </v>

508
00:23:13.481 --> 00:23:15.010
<v Speaker 2>spectrum of emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

509
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.770
<v Speaker 2>You're that kind of pride for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood,</v>

510
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.070
<v Speaker 2>for your town or your state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that gets weird.</v>

511
00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Till till you get to America.</v>

512
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.940
<v Speaker 2>That's where we crossed the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>

513
00:23:24.941 --> 00:23:25.774
<v Speaker 2>Boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mirka you better be proud that'd be </v>

514
00:23:28.871 --> 00:23:29.704
<v Speaker 2>proud of from here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump says he's going to put </v>

515
00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:33.580
<v Speaker 2>people in jail for a year if they burned</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flag.</v>

516
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.833
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton proposed this in 2005 I </v>

517
00:23:38.861 --> 00:23:41.260
<v Speaker 2>didn't know that somebody tweeted that </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me on twitter.</v>

518
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 2>I think they're having an affair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably been out the whole time.</v>

519
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I feel like either way we win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

520
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.513
<v Speaker 1>That's what's been going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those little shitty little caddy </v>

521
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:52.440
<v Speaker 1>remarks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

522
00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:54.740
<v Speaker 1>What lovers say to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

523
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.753
<v Speaker 1>When they get nasty with each other and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then them taking me you fucking </v>

524
00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:03.000
<v Speaker 1>deplorable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deplorable basket,</v>

525
00:24:03.001 --> 00:24:05.870
<v Speaker 1>but a bucketed deplorables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it and people,</v>

526
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:07.130
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just jumped on it.</v>

527
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:08.203
<v Speaker 1>They've been the worst at like creating </v>
<v Speaker 1>like memes and stuff and like the worst </v>

528
00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:14.414
<v Speaker 1>at coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were the worst that like coming up </v>

529
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:19.760
<v Speaker 1>with a campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thoughts,</v>

530
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.290
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was just too,</v>

531
00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.170
<v Speaker 1>too many things going on with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>election where it was just like,</v>

532
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:26.600
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are not not that good at this.</v>

533
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with her.</v>

534
00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Don't say I'm with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't say that's Jesus Christ.</v>

535
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.180
<v Speaker 1>How obvious we making it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It were just voting for a check.</v>

536
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Like how obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's more than that.</v>

537
00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.150
<v Speaker 1>It's more than that</v>

538
00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.170
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This everything is getting squirrely and</v>

539
00:24:44.171 --> 00:24:45.004
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the most brilliant parts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Jordan Peterson's podcast yesterday </v>

540
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:48.543
<v Speaker 3>was that he identified in his mind and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>tend to agree with them that one of the </v>

541
00:24:51.701 --> 00:24:52.534
<v Speaker 3>reasons why things are getting so </v>
<v Speaker 3>squirrely as we've removed the </v>

542
00:24:54.461 --> 00:24:55.294
<v Speaker 3>metaphysical underpinnings behind our </v>
<v Speaker 3>understandings of everything you know </v>

543
00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:02.830
<v Speaker 3>and so like all of this social justice </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these pronouns,</v>

544
00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:03.933
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of that is that we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>removed the metaphysical understanding </v>

545
00:25:07.361 --> 00:25:08.194
<v Speaker 3>of self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know and so if you really don't </v>

546
00:25:09.701 --> 00:25:14.470
<v Speaker 3>understand who yourself is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you really can't have self love,</v>

547
00:25:14.471 --> 00:25:15.304
<v Speaker 3>self worth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>self confidence because it's all built </v>

548
00:25:17.171 --> 00:25:20.830
<v Speaker 3>on something else and that surrogate for</v>
<v Speaker 3>self that they create his identity,</v>

549
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.350
<v Speaker 3>who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what Pronoun you are,</v>

550
00:25:23.351 --> 00:25:26.500
<v Speaker 3>what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what tribe you identify with,</v>

551
00:25:26.501 --> 00:25:28.720
<v Speaker 3>what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what your race is.</v>

552
00:25:28.721 --> 00:25:29.554
<v Speaker 3>And then all of these parts of identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which really have absolutely nothing to </v>

553
00:25:32.801 --> 00:25:37.000
<v Speaker 3>do with self in the metaphysical sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>become the thing that you defend.</v>

554
00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.370
<v Speaker 3>You defend that thing as if it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

555
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.980
<v Speaker 3>But it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's,</v>

556
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:42.873
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the paths that I've taken is to </v>

557
00:25:44.471 --> 00:25:46.720
<v Speaker 3>understand those metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 3>underpinnings.</v>

558
00:25:46.721 --> 00:25:47.554
<v Speaker 3>I understand what the self is rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>than just trying to work on self worth </v>

559
00:25:52.541 --> 00:25:53.374
<v Speaker 3>and self confidence and self love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you got to fucking first understand </v>

560
00:25:56.381 --> 00:25:57.214
<v Speaker 3>the cell.</v>

561
00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:58.860
<v Speaker 1>He was a deep dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>

562
00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.870
<v Speaker 1>that the stuff that he was saying about </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

563
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:02.783
<v Speaker 1>about the need for this understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 1>good and evil and then how it plays out </v>

564
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:11.880
<v Speaker 1>and to just stay on that balance of good</v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil and to,</v>

565
00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:12.743
<v Speaker 1>to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what he was talking about a </v>

566
00:26:13.921 --> 00:26:17.130
<v Speaker 1>true life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating because it was one of</v>

567
00:26:17.131 --> 00:26:17.964
<v Speaker 1>those things where he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's thinking at an extremely high </v>

568
00:26:19.951 --> 00:26:22.620
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're following them,</v>

569
00:26:22.621 --> 00:26:24.630
<v Speaker 1>you have to be sure you're following </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

570
00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

571
00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:26.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm really getting what he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

572
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.043
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he's talking about being someone </v>

573
00:26:30.571 --> 00:26:34.080
<v Speaker 1>who hates ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a very religious man.</v>

574
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.430
<v Speaker 3>I think really the most confusing part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what he was saying was the use of the</v>

575
00:26:38.431 --> 00:26:41.010
<v Speaker 3>word religion because it a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Danielle,</v>

576
00:26:41.011 --> 00:26:42.600
<v Speaker 3>he and his book create your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>

577
00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 3>He's created</v>

578
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:48.030
<v Speaker 4>his variation of religion that allows </v>
<v Speaker 4>him to use that word,</v>

579
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.500
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But for most people,</v>

580
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:52.260
<v Speaker 4>the colloquial understanding of religion</v>
<v Speaker 4>is much,</v>

581
00:26:52.261 --> 00:26:54.010
<v Speaker 4>much different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think it was confused.</v>

582
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:58.800
<v Speaker 4>I think he would probably benefit from </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe looking at that word and seeing if</v>

583
00:26:58.801 --> 00:27:00.600
<v Speaker 4>it's conveying what he actually means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

584
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.593
<v Speaker 5>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think I understood what he was </v>

585
00:27:02.861 --> 00:27:04.930
<v Speaker 5>saying and I think he definitely </v>
<v Speaker 5>understood what he was saying.</v>

586
00:27:04.931 --> 00:27:05.950
<v Speaker 5>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

587
00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.053
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's looking at it in terms of that </v>

588
00:27:08.231 --> 00:27:13.231
<v Speaker 5>these archetypal stories are integral to</v>
<v Speaker 5>being human 100% and that they've been a</v>

589
00:27:13.691 --> 00:27:14.524
<v Speaker 5>part of our life for so long that this </v>
<v Speaker 5>recent jettison that our society has </v>

590
00:27:19.391 --> 00:27:20.620
<v Speaker 5>taken away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

591
00:27:20.621 --> 00:27:21.454
<v Speaker 5>we've sort of launched ourselves away </v>
<v Speaker 5>and become more and more cynical about </v>

592
00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:28.840
<v Speaker 5>our roots and our understanding of who </v>
<v Speaker 5>we are in this world.</v>

593
00:27:28.841 --> 00:27:30.820
<v Speaker 5>And like what is important and what is </v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit,</v>

594
00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.280
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's all great.</v>

595
00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.160
<v Speaker 5>I think that's super important and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

596
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:38.050
<v Speaker 5>that's what human beings are here for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're here to be curious.</v>

597
00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.633
<v Speaker 5>But one of the things that I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>people really do really well with his </v>

598
00:27:43.571 --> 00:27:47.290
<v Speaker 5>structure and when people don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>structure,</v>

599
00:27:47.291 --> 00:27:48.580
<v Speaker 5>like a reason</v>

600
00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.360
<v Speaker 4>to behave in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

601
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.310
<v Speaker 4>an ethical and kind way yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or,</v>

602
00:27:54.311 --> 00:27:55.001
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

603
00:27:55.001 --> 00:27:55.834
<v Speaker 4>a better to strive for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They struggle without structure and </v>

604
00:27:59.111 --> 00:28:02.140
<v Speaker 4>without truth as the bedrock truth forms</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bedrock.</v>

605
00:28:02.141 --> 00:28:02.974
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's what he really meant </v>
<v Speaker 4>about these religious truth as compared </v>

606
00:28:05.561 --> 00:28:06.700
<v Speaker 4>to scientific truths,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

607
00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:07.683
<v Speaker 4>these true understandings that form the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bedrock that you can build everything </v>

608
00:28:10.241 --> 00:28:12.220
<v Speaker 4>else off of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

609
00:28:12.221 --> 00:28:14.770
<v Speaker 4>going back to self,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what is the self?</v>

610
00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.480
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you look deeper and deeper,</v>

611
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.770
<v Speaker 4>it's nothing but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the embodied consciousness,</v>

612
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.903
<v Speaker 4>the consciousness within us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when you understand that your </v>

613
00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:24.994
<v Speaker 4>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can ditch all of these other </v>

614
00:28:27.311 --> 00:28:30.190
<v Speaker 4>things that you're trying to pile on top</v>
<v Speaker 4>of and make it so important,</v>

615
00:28:30.191 --> 00:28:34.180
<v Speaker 4>like all of these identity things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you have to get to at least where my</v>

616
00:28:34.181 --> 00:28:35.014
<v Speaker 4>metaphysical understanding is that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>self is consciousness embodied in this </v>

617
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:39.063
<v Speaker 4>awesome meet vehicle we get to play </v>
<v Speaker 4>around with and experience life and </v>

618
00:28:42.041 --> 00:28:42.874
<v Speaker 4>interact with each other and tastes </v>
<v Speaker 4>things and fight things and fuck things </v>

619
00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.810
<v Speaker 4>like it's amazing.</v>

620
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:48.280
<v Speaker 4>But ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

621
00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.710
<v Speaker 4>we're just that that spark of </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>

622
00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck knows.</v>

623
00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:54.653
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what he was saying was cool cause </v>

624
00:28:57.071 --> 00:29:00.850
<v Speaker 4>we'll do what he was saying it was when </v>
<v Speaker 4>Peterson was talking about it,</v>

625
00:29:00.851 --> 00:29:03.550
<v Speaker 4>it was this different level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding I think.</v>

626
00:29:03.551 --> 00:29:05.650
<v Speaker 4>And he's so incredibly well read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No doubt.</v>

627
00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:09.940
<v Speaker 4>I really liked what he was saying too </v>
<v Speaker 4>about you know how and one of the,</v>

628
00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:11.890
<v Speaker 4>one of the metaphysical understandings </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I have it,</v>

629
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think you arrive at it from </v>
<v Speaker 4>different ways.</v>

630
00:29:13.871 --> 00:29:14.704
<v Speaker 4>I think religion can obviously be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>great vehicle to help you arrive at </v>

631
00:29:17.261 --> 00:29:19.390
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do it through philosophy.</v>

632
00:29:19.391 --> 00:29:20.224
<v Speaker 4>You can do it through experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've kind of gone mostly through </v>

633
00:29:23.771 --> 00:29:26.320
<v Speaker 4>that experience route with a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>plant medicines and things.</v>

634
00:29:26.321 --> 00:29:27.154
<v Speaker 4>And you arrive at these different truths</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that idea that you reconcile the </v>

635
00:29:31.241 --> 00:29:32.074
<v Speaker 4>darkness within you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing inside yourself that is </v>

636
00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:37.180
<v Speaker 4>inherently has all the capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 4>evil.</v>

637
00:29:37.181 --> 00:29:42.181
<v Speaker 4>That was brought to me and in like in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic experience where I was going</v>

638
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:47.340
<v Speaker 3>in and I realized that I myself was all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the darkness and all the light.</v>

639
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.213
<v Speaker 3>I was good and bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a raid on a spectrum and was capable of </v>

640
00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:54.220
<v Speaker 3>doing every good thing in every bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

641
00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:56.980
<v Speaker 3>And it was the most horrifying </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience I've ever had.</v>

642
00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.760
<v Speaker 3>Like recognizing that I was all of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

643
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.570
<v Speaker 3>But the only thing that made it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that decided who I was was choice.</v>

644
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:05.463
<v Speaker 3>And that choice was enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you had to first reconcile the </v>

645
00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:12.970
<v Speaker 3>capability of being everything before </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can layer on that element of,</v>

646
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.740
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am everything,</v>

647
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.900
<v Speaker 3>but I choose to be this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I choose truth.</v>

648
00:30:16.901 --> 00:30:20.080
<v Speaker 3>I choose love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I choose to have faith against the fear.</v>

649
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.760
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

650
00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:22.594
<v Speaker 3>that's ultimately then who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But going down into those subterranean </v>

651
00:30:25.901 --> 00:30:28.810
<v Speaker 3>depths and realizing that we all have </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up thoughts.</v>

652
00:30:28.811 --> 00:30:31.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all a little bit off here or there</v>

653
00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.130
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's super important to </v>
<v Speaker 3>reconcile.</v>

654
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Just like watching that fucking road </v>
<v Speaker 1>runner Jack,</v>

655
00:30:35.821 --> 00:30:37.560
<v Speaker 1>that snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're animals,</v>

656
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:42.540
<v Speaker 1>we're living organisms and we are living</v>
<v Speaker 1>organisms that are aware of is crazy.</v>

657
00:30:42.541 --> 00:30:47.541
<v Speaker 1>See of genes that we live in is see a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking sells competing for survival and</v>

658
00:30:50.041 --> 00:30:54.570
<v Speaker 1>these weird forms with these weird rules</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're in that.</v>

659
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.673
<v Speaker 1>But what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as we know when the only ones </v>

660
00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:02.040
<v Speaker 1>that are aware that we're in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless dolphins are aware,</v>

661
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.350
<v Speaker 1>they can be aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever heard of something called</v>

662
00:31:04.351 --> 00:31:08.400
<v Speaker 1>the false killer whale [inaudible] dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Hawaii this week.</v>

663
00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:09.443
<v Speaker 1>We did a little fishing with the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a great time and we're on this boat </v>

664
00:31:12.631 --> 00:31:14.160
<v Speaker 1>and this Guy Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was on the boat with me,</v>

665
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:15.463
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was one of the guys working on the </v>

666
00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:21.150
<v Speaker 1>boat told me that they had a run in with</v>
<v Speaker 1>these false killer whales when they were</v>

667
00:31:21.151 --> 00:31:26.151
<v Speaker 1>pulling in these 50 pound tunas and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking gigantic 20 foot long thing.</v>

668
00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.470
<v Speaker 1>That thing ever seen one of those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

669
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.410
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did I not know that that existed?</v>

670
00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.113
<v Speaker 1>This crazy looking weird whale thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with giant ass teeth and they call them </v>

671
00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:42.060
<v Speaker 1>false killer whales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

672
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's like some sort of a dolphin</v>

673
00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:48.210
<v Speaker 1>subspecies or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this a killer whale is too,</v>

674
00:31:48.211 --> 00:31:50.370
<v Speaker 1>they're all cousins I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>

675
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:55.110
<v Speaker 1>this thing snacked this fucking 50 pound</v>
<v Speaker 1>tuna right off the hook.</v>

676
00:31:55.111 --> 00:31:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Just ripped it off in front of him while</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was pulling it in.</v>

677
00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.730
<v Speaker 1>And so they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus Christ,</v>

678
00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:01.260
<v Speaker 1>these things are going to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

679
00:32:01.261 --> 00:32:03.720
<v Speaker 1>let's get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll go somewhere else.</v>

680
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.360
<v Speaker 1>They went five miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These fucking things.</v>

681
00:32:06.361 --> 00:32:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Follow them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five miles and Jak,</v>

682
00:32:08.791 --> 00:32:12.900
<v Speaker 1>two more fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wild,</v>

683
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.730
<v Speaker 1>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild world out there.</v>

684
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.610
<v Speaker 1>This weekend I had a porpoise steal a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tuna from me.</v>

685
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.420
<v Speaker 1>We were t catching these little </v>
<v Speaker 1>amberjack tuna's,</v>

686
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:21.263
<v Speaker 1>they're not that big like a big one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 20 pounds is like as big as they </v>

687
00:32:23.821 --> 00:32:27.390
<v Speaker 1>get to like most of like 10 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're really tasty.</v>

688
00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.253
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're catching these things and I'm </v>

689
00:32:29.581 --> 00:32:30.414
<v Speaker 1>pulling them in and he's going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing is going crazy and the </v>

690
00:32:34.951 --> 00:32:38.430
<v Speaker 1>skipper says there's probably a porpoise</v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing yet.</v>

691
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no fucking way.</v>

692
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 1>He's</v>

693
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.311
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

694
00:32:40.311 --> 00:32:43.640
<v Speaker 2>they do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They grow up going around this.</v>

695
00:32:43.641 --> 00:32:45.950
<v Speaker 2>There's this one area where these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

696
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:48.700
<v Speaker 2>these tune is live skipjacks that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're called,</v>

697
00:32:48.701 --> 00:32:53.701
<v Speaker 2>non amberjack skipjack tuna and this one</v>
<v Speaker 2>area where they populate.</v>

698
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:54.853
<v Speaker 2>These fucking dolphins have grown up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that they can hang around those </v>

699
00:32:58.161 --> 00:32:58.994
<v Speaker 2>boats and they wait until someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>catches one and then when they fighting </v>

700
00:33:02.181 --> 00:33:03.680
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't move very quick.</v>

701
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.950
<v Speaker 2>So these swim up to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's on the line and they just jack</v>

702
00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:08.960
<v Speaker 2>them and he jacked it right in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

703
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Right in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

704
00:33:09.981 --> 00:33:10.814
<v Speaker 2>no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see this dark shadow underneath </v>

705
00:33:13.551 --> 00:33:14.384
<v Speaker 2>the water come near this flashing fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to yank this crazy tug and then </v>

706
00:33:19.251 --> 00:33:20.550
<v Speaker 2>the line goes limp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

707
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this porpoise.</v>

708
00:33:23.631 --> 00:33:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Just Jack that tuna right in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

709
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.430
<v Speaker 2>Do that for the Chinook salmon out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>British Columbia to yeah,</v>

710
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:30.920
<v Speaker 2>they pull your salmon off the line.</v>

711
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:31.843
<v Speaker 2>They're smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they figured out that if your </v>

712
00:33:33.021 --> 00:33:35.360
<v Speaker 2>line is taught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fish ain't moving anywhere.</v>

713
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:36.770
<v Speaker 2>It's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to go this way.</v>

714
00:33:36.771 --> 00:33:39.290
<v Speaker 2>The drag and the real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like easy one to get.</v>

715
00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.313
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you never hooked those animals to </v>

716
00:33:41.421 --> 00:33:42.650
<v Speaker 2>theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're too smart for that.</v>

717
00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.050
<v Speaker 2>But I said he's hooked him before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

718
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:45.080
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hooked him before.</v>

719
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:47.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that they accidentally had</v>
<v Speaker 2>snagged one before.</v>

720
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like body snag.</v>

721
00:33:49.191 --> 00:33:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it got bodies like a dolphin.</v>

722
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.400
<v Speaker 2>The dolphin will eat your fish to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

723
00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.590
<v Speaker 2>They'll get caught in nets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just can't see him.</v>

724
00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.360
<v Speaker 2>But you don't see him get cotton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those hooks.</v>

725
00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never get,</v>

726
00:34:00.321 --> 00:34:03.140
<v Speaker 2>that was one of my bits that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people live in the water,</v>

727
00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:03.974
<v Speaker 2>you'd catch them all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this difference between dolphins </v>

728
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:07.064
<v Speaker 2>and people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they eat fish but we don't </v>

729
00:34:08.271 --> 00:34:09.710
<v Speaker 2>catch them when you go fishing.</v>

730
00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:12.930
<v Speaker 2>Like it's Kinda crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the um,</v>

731
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.260
<v Speaker 2>the guy said that they had to pull one </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some,</v>

732
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:16.123
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the circumstances were but</v>
<v Speaker 2>it got foul hooked and they had to pull </v>

733
00:34:18.771 --> 00:34:20.770
<v Speaker 2>it in and a release the hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

734
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Taking the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be really careful with it.</v>

735
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

736
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.793
<v Speaker 2>Going back to what you were saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>though about the self being this like </v>

737
00:34:26.541 --> 00:34:27.374
<v Speaker 2>collection of cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really kind of </v>

738
00:34:29.391 --> 00:34:34.391
<v Speaker 2>interesting because the self is so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different cells that are kind of sending</v>

739
00:34:34.401 --> 00:34:35.234
<v Speaker 2>competing signals to the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them trying to almost vie for </v>

740
00:34:38.451 --> 00:34:39.284
<v Speaker 2>their own survival and then the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>puts out like a prime directive of what </v>

741
00:34:42.681 --> 00:34:45.980
<v Speaker 2>the things that are best for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now that we're understanding so much</v>

742
00:34:45.981 --> 00:34:49.100
<v Speaker 2>of our gut biome and how much that </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributes to the self,</v>

743
00:34:49.101 --> 00:34:50.240
<v Speaker 2>it contributes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

744
00:34:50.241 --> 00:34:52.490
<v Speaker 2>neurotransmitter production,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immune cell production,</v>

745
00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:57.820
<v Speaker 2>but every time we shit we drop a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that gut biome into the toilet.</v>

746
00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to feed on the,</v>

747
00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.000
<v Speaker 2>on the feces and then we drop it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

748
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's like ourself is changing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

749
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:06.703
<v Speaker 2>every time we take a dump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that collection of things that we </v>

750
00:35:09.411 --> 00:35:12.110
<v Speaker 2>call self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are some pathogenic organisms,</v>

751
00:35:12.111 --> 00:35:14.480
<v Speaker 2>some helpful organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some skin cells,</v>

752
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.290
<v Speaker 2>all of it's contributing to self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of it's contributing messages to the</v>

753
00:35:18.291 --> 00:35:20.780
<v Speaker 2>brain and it's changing and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

754
00:35:20.781 --> 00:35:23.390
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's why people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they go looking for the self,</v>

755
00:35:23.391 --> 00:35:27.500
<v Speaker 2>it's so squirly cause what is the self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it changes every single day.</v>

756
00:35:27.501 --> 00:35:31.340
<v Speaker 2>You're a different self when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>angry or happy or mad or in love as when</v>

757
00:35:31.341 --> 00:35:33.650
<v Speaker 2>you're inspired or after a workout </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're different self.</v>

758
00:35:33.651 --> 00:35:34.484
<v Speaker 2>Then when you start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just this amalgamation but it's </v>

759
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:40.110
<v Speaker 2>almost an ideology of self to call it </v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing and call it,</v>

760
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.220
<v Speaker 2>oh this is me.</v>

761
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're really,</v>

762
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:45.330
<v Speaker 2>we're just this a lot more nebulous than</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

763
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:49.530
<v Speaker 2>And that's why people get confused and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to cling to something concrete</v>

764
00:35:49.531 --> 00:35:51.990
<v Speaker 2>and ideology self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here I am.</v>

765
00:35:51.991 --> 00:35:55.200
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you got a v a vague idea of who you</v>

766
00:35:55.201 --> 00:35:56.070
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

767
00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.950
<v Speaker 2>Like you kind of know you know a </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>

768
00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been down this road.</v>

769
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I know that's road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

770
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.830
<v Speaker 2>he could go down a bad road one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

771
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.850
<v Speaker 2>go down to someone towed your car and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't supposed to road and you're</v>

772
00:36:08.851 --> 00:36:10.080
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh I didn't even know this dude.</v>

773
00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.330
<v Speaker 2>He there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's weird parts of you that come out</v>

774
00:36:15.331 --> 00:36:19.080
<v Speaker 2>and weird altercations or weird moments </v>
<v Speaker 2>of vulnerability and you go,</v>

775
00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:19.914
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know that person was in </v>

776
00:36:20.371 --> 00:36:21.204
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

777
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Like just looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even as much as I think about it,</v>

778
00:36:24.961 --> 00:36:27.090
<v Speaker 2>I'll still get stuck and weird self </v>
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>

779
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:27.953
<v Speaker 2>Like this past Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was all the </v>

780
00:36:30.391 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Thanksgiving from like noon to 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>PM on Saturday,</v>

781
00:36:33.961 --> 00:36:36.270
<v Speaker 2>I was a comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the worst.</v>

782
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.900
<v Speaker 2>I was the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

783
00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.080
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even want to hang out with </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

784
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then at some point like around seven</v>

785
00:36:43.351 --> 00:36:44.940
<v Speaker 2>o'clock I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

786
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:46.720
<v Speaker 2>like what is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you let,</v>

787
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.750
<v Speaker 2>did you eat too much shitty food?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

788
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>

789
00:36:50.101 --> 00:36:51.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

790
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the my mail menstrual cycle,</v>

791
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.010
<v Speaker 2>it was in what way were you like short </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people where you just like,</v>

792
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.030
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't want to be around.</v>

793
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Everything was like such a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a big deal,</v>

794
00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:07.590
<v Speaker 2>you know like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever little thing came up was like a</v>

795
00:37:07.591 --> 00:37:11.670
<v Speaker 2>life ending life shattering thing and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just weird.</v>

796
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.940
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it lifted like a fog.</v>

797
00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:18.120
<v Speaker 2>Like just like when the clouds move and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the son Pierce through and I was like,</v>

798
00:37:18.121 --> 00:37:20.280
<v Speaker 2>what the hell was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

799
00:37:20.281 --> 00:37:25.281
<v Speaker 2>so that self is a slightly different </v>
<v Speaker 2>self then the self that came after it,</v>

800
00:37:25.581 --> 00:37:28.830
<v Speaker 2>the self that's here now the self on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cup of coffee versus that.</v>

801
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.480
<v Speaker 2>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

802
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:31.943
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we try to oversimplify that when really </v>

803
00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:36.750
<v Speaker 2>we're so much more than what we are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there aren't boundaries.</v>

804
00:37:36.751 --> 00:37:39.030
<v Speaker 2>This idea that you can contain </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

805
00:37:39.031 --> 00:37:39.864
<v Speaker 2>This is me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not me I think really doesn't </v>

806
00:37:41.881 --> 00:37:42.714
<v Speaker 2>make a lot of sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we filled some techniques to making </v>

807
00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:47.940
<v Speaker 2>yourself more positive all the time.</v>

808
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:49.003
<v Speaker 2>Like I think that's one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the Wim Hoff breathing that I </v>

809
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:52.583
<v Speaker 2>really like is that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do an any kind of breathing </v>

810
00:37:54.301 --> 00:37:55.890
<v Speaker 2>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think any,</v>

811
00:37:55.891 --> 00:37:58.170
<v Speaker 2>like even a the beginning of beak from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga,</v>

812
00:37:58.171 --> 00:37:59.004
<v Speaker 2>when you do that crazy breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you breathe and then your net goes </v>

813
00:38:02.371 --> 00:38:03.810
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what,</v>

814
00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.713
<v Speaker 2>what that really makes you do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on the moment and it </v>

815
00:38:09.061 --> 00:38:09.894
<v Speaker 2>releases excess tension to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you have a better ability to be </v>

816
00:38:13.381 --> 00:38:14.760
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

817
00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of burdens that we</v>

818
00:38:16.651 --> 00:38:17.484
<v Speaker 2>don't recognize that cling to us and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're carrying them around and we don't </v>

819
00:38:20.641 --> 00:38:23.580
<v Speaker 2>realize it until we get them free and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then we'll go,</v>

820
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.540
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

821
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:26.520
<v Speaker 2>I needed to go run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

822
00:38:26.521 --> 00:38:29.160
<v Speaker 2>like there's some times you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just needed to lift,</v>

823
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I need to do something now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's bothering me.</v>

824
00:38:31.411 --> 00:38:36.080
<v Speaker 2>Like this same world exists but 45 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes or rigorous exercise</v>

825
00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.510
<v Speaker 5>and he don't give a fuck about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

826
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:41.320
<v Speaker 5>And this thing that was this </v>
<v Speaker 5>overwhelming moment in your life,</v>

827
00:38:41.321 --> 00:38:45.470
<v Speaker 5>like it's all a matter of perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>

828
00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:46.943
<v Speaker 3>and the best perspective that I find is </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I can tap into that consciousness </v>

829
00:38:50.821 --> 00:38:52.100
<v Speaker 3>element,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you can call it,</v>

830
00:38:52.101 --> 00:38:53.970
<v Speaker 3>your people call it your higher self,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

831
00:38:53.971 --> 00:38:58.080
<v Speaker 3>There's a billion names for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the best version of yourself.</v>

832
00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like who you are at your very,</v>

833
00:39:00.391 --> 00:39:01.224
<v Speaker 3>very best when you're filled with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most love and the most peace and the </v>

834
00:39:04.441 --> 00:39:07.800
<v Speaker 3>most like inner just contentment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>satisfaction,</v>

835
00:39:07.801 --> 00:39:11.130
<v Speaker 3>like your best self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you can ask,</v>

836
00:39:11.131 --> 00:39:13.140
<v Speaker 3>find ways to access that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think absolutely right.</v>

837
00:39:13.141 --> 00:39:14.490
<v Speaker 3>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing,</v>

838
00:39:14.491 --> 00:39:16.080
<v Speaker 3>flotation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

839
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.153
<v Speaker 3>nature flow state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these ways are ways to tap into </v>

840
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:21.930
<v Speaker 3>that best self,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is usually,</v>

841
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:23.043
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anchored in the present moment and is </v>

842
00:39:24.661 --> 00:39:27.030
<v Speaker 3>you at your very best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And from that vantage point,</v>

843
00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.480
<v Speaker 3>you see the obstacles laid out in front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of you and maybe they don't go away,</v>

844
00:39:30.481 --> 00:39:32.340
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you can look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

845
00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.030
<v Speaker 3>as you should like an advantage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to grow stronger,</v>

846
00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:36.953
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

847
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just perspective.</v>

848
00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.280
<v Speaker 5>I think their purse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think all of those things,</v>

849
00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.640
<v Speaker 5>including marijuana and a lot other </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic compounds,</v>

850
00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.280
<v Speaker 5>their perspective enhancers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

851
00:39:46.281 --> 00:39:47.670
<v Speaker 5>and I think that's what they're here </v>
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>

852
00:39:47.671 --> 00:39:51.270
<v Speaker 5>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we equate them with the negative aspects</v>

853
00:39:51.271 --> 00:39:52.740
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know that some drugs have on people,</v>

854
00:39:52.741 --> 00:39:53.940
<v Speaker 5>so we know that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

855
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:54.893
<v Speaker 5>sometimes they can be bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I feel that same way about religion </v>

856
00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.780
<v Speaker 5>and I feel that same way about </v>
<v Speaker 5>government.</v>

857
00:40:00.781 --> 00:40:02.160
<v Speaker 5>I feel that same way about a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

858
00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:05.130
<v Speaker 5>just because certain aspects of it are </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked.</v>

859
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:09.360
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean it doesn't have some </v>
<v Speaker 5>massive benefits for us.</v>

860
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:13.800
<v Speaker 5>Like even like you could call it like </v>
<v Speaker 5>religion.</v>

861
00:40:13.801 --> 00:40:16.290
<v Speaker 5>A lot of ways it's like bill cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

862
00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.100
<v Speaker 5>Is Bill Cosby did some horrible shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some horrible shit.</v>

863
00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:21.240
<v Speaker 5>Most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

864
00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:23.310
<v Speaker 5>But he made a lot of fucking people </v>
<v Speaker 5>laugh.</v>

865
00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

866
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:26.130
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot of people.</v>

867
00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:26.963
<v Speaker 5>If you looked at the number of victims </v>
<v Speaker 5>versus the number of people that </v>

868
00:40:29.911 --> 00:40:31.800
<v Speaker 5>benefited from it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hit him.</v>

869
00:40:31.801 --> 00:40:32.341
<v Speaker 5>You'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

870
00:40:32.341 --> 00:40:33.174
<v Speaker 5>what a complex situation that says you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have this monster who also is doing </v>

871
00:40:36.451 --> 00:40:38.180
<v Speaker 5>amazing work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

872
00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:39.123
<v Speaker 5>Like he's making people show happy </v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere and he's enforcing this like </v>

873
00:40:41.251 --> 00:40:45.000
<v Speaker 5>really positive way of behaving and </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking for people.</v>

874
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.150
<v Speaker 5>Like you could never imagine yourself </v>
<v Speaker 5>swaying around bill cosby,</v>

875
00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:53.420
<v Speaker 5>you know he was this upstanding PhD guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think in a lot of ways that's the same</v>

876
00:40:55.441 --> 00:40:56.274
<v Speaker 5>way about religion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if it wasn't for religion and I'm </v>

877
00:40:58.801 --> 00:40:59.634
<v Speaker 5>not an advocate of religion currently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like to use it currently in the same </v>

878
00:41:02.701 --> 00:41:03.534
<v Speaker 5>form that everybody's using it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm just saying if you looked at </v>

879
00:41:05.131 --> 00:41:05.964
<v Speaker 5>like humankind as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it wasn't for believing that we had </v>

880
00:41:10.051 --> 00:41:12.390
<v Speaker 5>these crazy rules,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then we had to do good.</v>

881
00:41:12.391 --> 00:41:15.900
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise the dad would come and strike </v>
<v Speaker 5>a stat if it wasn't like the fear,</v>

882
00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:16.763
<v Speaker 5>literally live literal fear of God that </v>
<v Speaker 5>kept people from just raping and </v>

883
00:41:21.151 --> 00:41:23.040
<v Speaker 5>pillaging and doing whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>they wanted to.</v>

884
00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:24.143
<v Speaker 5>Who knows how much longer it would have </v>
<v Speaker 5>taken us to get to the place where you </v>

885
00:41:26.971 --> 00:41:29.630
<v Speaker 5>can fight over gender pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

886
00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.220
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

887
00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:34.610
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like a system that may at </v>
<v Speaker 3>some have been necessary.</v>

888
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:35.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know that people,</v>

889
00:41:35.931 --> 00:41:36.764
<v Speaker 2>we weren't around people 3000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what they would've done </v>

890
00:41:40.341 --> 00:41:44.390
<v Speaker 2>without the threat and that fear of God </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there was no dna evidence.</v>

891
00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:45.520
<v Speaker 2>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

892
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.470
<v Speaker 2>inspectors and detective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe it was necessary,</v>

893
00:41:48.471 --> 00:41:49.304
<v Speaker 2>but clearly now the dogma that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding it is an impediment to our </v>

894
00:41:53.031 --> 00:41:55.130
<v Speaker 2>happiness and impediment to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

895
00:41:55.131 --> 00:41:55.964
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better truths that are going to </v>

896
00:41:57.261 --> 00:41:59.140
<v Speaker 2>hopefully make this world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

897
00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.470
<v Speaker 2>a more positive place for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they,</v>

898
00:42:01.471 --> 00:42:02.304
<v Speaker 2>because I think you nailed it when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>said like a program because I think </v>

899
00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:05.894
<v Speaker 2>that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a program that human </v>

900
00:42:08.301 --> 00:42:13.301
<v Speaker 2>beings sort of manifested to travel to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next stage of development.</v>

901
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:15.921
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

902
00:42:15.921 --> 00:42:18.110
<v Speaker 2>we're just not going to get here to </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and claw.</v>

903
00:42:18.111 --> 00:42:18.944
<v Speaker 2>I ain't going to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy.</v>

904
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:19.491
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

905
00:42:19.491 --> 00:42:21.770
<v Speaker 2>we've got agriculture but we're still </v>
<v Speaker 2>behaving like monsters.</v>

906
00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.520
<v Speaker 2>You know and they had to just figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>things to worship,</v>

907
00:42:25.521 --> 00:42:27.290
<v Speaker 2>things to love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things to cherish,</v>

908
00:42:27.291 --> 00:42:29.840
<v Speaker 2>things to believe in and the new pass </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things down.</v>

909
00:42:29.841 --> 00:42:30.674
<v Speaker 2>I was like this higher daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this higher daddy thing cause that's </v>

910
00:42:33.891 --> 00:42:34.730
<v Speaker 2>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

911
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.890
<v Speaker 2>The problem is a couple of people got </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

912
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.800
<v Speaker 2>saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jacked it jacked and then manipulated it</v>

913
00:42:39.801 --> 00:42:41.790
<v Speaker 2>for their own power and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to the gunk.</v>

914
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:43.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

915
00:42:43.821 --> 00:42:45.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean that whole move of all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You got to come see me and you got to </v>

917
00:42:48.801 --> 00:42:49.634
<v Speaker 2>build me a big house and you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay me every year and then I'll </v>

918
00:42:51.771 --> 00:42:53.390
<v Speaker 2>translate that message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

919
00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.850
<v Speaker 2>to the divine on your behalf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>

920
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:56.743
<v Speaker 2>My favorite version of that is you ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the dude who took pictures of </v>

921
00:42:58.881 --> 00:43:00.930
<v Speaker 2>himself in heaven?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

922
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:03.530
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucking,</v>

923
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.870
<v Speaker 2>he went to heaven pastor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came back,</v>

924
00:43:05.871 --> 00:43:06.704
<v Speaker 2>he had a suit on and a white background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white background and he said he was in </v>

925
00:43:10.311 --> 00:43:11.144
<v Speaker 2>heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took photos and he put them up on </v>

926
00:43:12.261 --> 00:43:13.094
<v Speaker 2>instagram.</v>

927
00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:15.913
<v Speaker 2>The photos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was selling the photos of him in </v>

928
00:43:18.921 --> 00:43:19.760
<v Speaker 2>heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

929
00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:20.683
<v Speaker 2>I come on son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in order for that to work for </v>

930
00:43:23.211 --> 00:43:24.044
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to break the brain early and I </v>

931
00:43:25.581 --> 00:43:28.760
<v Speaker 2>think you break the brain by saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like fear of God.</v>

932
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was all white man.</v>

933
00:43:36.231 --> 00:43:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Why does it have like a Rainbow Hue to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

934
00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Is it the same photo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

935
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.843
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could've sworn I might be another </v>

936
00:43:45.351 --> 00:43:46.280
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

937
00:43:46.281 --> 00:43:47.910
<v Speaker 2>it's the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely the same guy.</v>

938
00:43:47.911 --> 00:43:50.290
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same photo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the image looked yes.</v>

939
00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.920
<v Speaker 2>And that image he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

940
00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:52.843
<v Speaker 2>it was white and some of images it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I think somebody's added something </v>

941
00:43:55.971 --> 00:43:59.140
<v Speaker 2>to that photo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they put like the,</v>

942
00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:01.940
<v Speaker 2>the sun rays and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the one.</v>

943
00:44:01.941 --> 00:44:03.470
<v Speaker 2>The one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the one above him with the suit.</v>

944
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.140
<v Speaker 2>Not that one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kept going to the second row.</v>

945
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:06.861
<v Speaker 2>Second row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

946
00:44:06.861 --> 00:44:08.060
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Click on that one.</v>

947
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 2>That was the image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just him with a white background.</v>

948
00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:13.580
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

949
00:44:13.581 --> 00:44:14.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm in heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dog.</v>

950
00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Fucking know Jesus loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you man,</v>

951
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.120
<v Speaker 2>and he was selling these photos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slick suit though.</v>

952
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

953
00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Ruffled shirt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>

954
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 2>What he saw?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll burn your heart.</v>

955
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.023
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

956
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:35.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that would bring your </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart.</v>

957
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:38.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't want my heartburn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's green.</v>

958
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:38.873
<v Speaker 4>Your heart is good the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if there was a heaven and we </v>

959
00:44:42.931 --> 00:44:43.764
<v Speaker 4>were just talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if like one day the space </v>

960
00:44:45.541 --> 00:44:46.374
<v Speaker 4>shuttle takes the wrong turn and it's on</v>
<v Speaker 4>its way up into orbit and it just pops </v>

961
00:44:49.681 --> 00:44:52.020
<v Speaker 4>through this little hole and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>

962
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.500
<v Speaker 4>we're and have a Dan Heaven and they get</v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

963
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.810
<v Speaker 4>take their head gear off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can breathe.</v>

964
00:44:58.310 --> 00:44:59.970
<v Speaker 4>His angels hanging around up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

965
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:01.583
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just people have made that </v>

966
00:45:03.331 --> 00:45:04.164
<v Speaker 4>wrong turn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Jordan Peterson was saying of </v>

967
00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:05.994
<v Speaker 4>taking these things as literal when they</v>
<v Speaker 4>should be metaphysical like we all have </v>

968
00:45:09.091 --> 00:45:12.060
<v Speaker 4>the ability to create heaven and hell in</v>
<v Speaker 4>our own life,</v>

969
00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:12.894
<v Speaker 4>which is a point when we made and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when we are pure consciousness </v>

970
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:20.130
<v Speaker 4>what I've experienced at least from from</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the psychedelic experiences.</v>

971
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:20.963
<v Speaker 4>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the body disappears and becomes </v>

972
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:24.653
<v Speaker 4>less prominent and you're thinking you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are what seemingly just pure </v>

973
00:45:27.451 --> 00:45:28.590
<v Speaker 4>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

974
00:45:28.591 --> 00:45:32.640
<v Speaker 4>there's also that opportunity there for </v>
<v Speaker 4>heaven to embrace all of the love.</v>

975
00:45:32.641 --> 00:45:34.980
<v Speaker 4>And then there's also the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 4>look back on your life.</v>

976
00:45:34.981 --> 00:45:36.780
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

977
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.680
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really,</v>

978
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.810
<v Speaker 4>I made these choices that hurt these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and that is this almost hell,</v>

979
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

980
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.760
<v Speaker 4>so Helen Heaven is again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

981
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:48.210
<v Speaker 4>as above.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So below it's just a mental state,</v>

982
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.920
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that could be the same,</v>

983
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.960
<v Speaker 4>very same mental state that we go </v>
<v Speaker 4>across.</v>

984
00:45:51.961 --> 00:45:54.240
<v Speaker 4>But instead we tried to make it </v>
<v Speaker 4>concrete.</v>

985
00:45:54.241 --> 00:45:55.200
<v Speaker 4>We tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

986
00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:57.360
<v Speaker 4>Salvador Bosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

987
00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.253
<v Speaker 4>tried to create all of these horrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>things of things biting you and burning </v>

988
00:46:01.441 --> 00:46:02.274
<v Speaker 4>you in vis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rating your genitals and prying you </v>

989
00:46:03.691 --> 00:46:04.524
<v Speaker 4>apart when all of that is really a </v>
<v Speaker 4>metaphor for what's happening in your </v>

990
00:46:07.051 --> 00:46:08.160
<v Speaker 4>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

991
00:46:08.161 --> 00:46:09.450
<v Speaker 4>not an actual place.</v>

992
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:12.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the mind of Dick Cheney.</v>

993
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:14.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kinda his Dick Cheney,</v>

994
00:46:14.431 --> 00:46:16.870
<v Speaker 4>go to sleep without pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

995
00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.713
<v Speaker 4>what kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of dreams does that guy have </v>

996
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:20.670
<v Speaker 4>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>

997
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:23.790
<v Speaker 4>And what happens when he's liberated </v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

998
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:26.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from all of the rationalizations.</v>

999
00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:27.560
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when,</v>

1000
00:46:27.561 --> 00:46:29.400
<v Speaker 4>when all of those things is to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1001
00:46:29.401 --> 00:46:30.234
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get in the float tank and you see </v>

1002
00:46:31.171 --> 00:46:32.004
<v Speaker 4>all these things that have allowed you </v>
<v Speaker 4>to think a certain way and then you go </v>

1003
00:46:34.411 --> 00:46:37.890
<v Speaker 4>floating and then all of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>structures go apart and then you look at</v>

1004
00:46:37.891 --> 00:46:40.060
<v Speaker 4>that thing you did and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

1005
00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.910
<v Speaker 4>was that cool?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that Douchey?</v>

1006
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.160
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you cause it,</v>

1007
00:46:44.161 --> 00:46:44.994
<v Speaker 4>but he's never had that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's never stopped the hamster wheel </v>

1008
00:46:47.251 --> 00:46:48.084
<v Speaker 4>long enough to get still to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at his life from his higher self </v>

1009
00:46:51.091 --> 00:46:51.871
<v Speaker 4>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

1010
00:46:51.871 --> 00:46:52.620
<v Speaker 4>what am I doing?</v>

1011
00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:55.950
<v Speaker 4>Look at all this momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at all the software viruses that my</v>

1012
00:46:55.951 --> 00:46:59.220
<v Speaker 4>open open source consciousness has </v>
<v Speaker 4>picked up along the way.</v>

1013
00:46:59.221 --> 00:47:01.200
<v Speaker 4>These different fears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different greeds,</v>

1014
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.230
<v Speaker 4>these lust for power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these different things that have created</v>

1015
00:47:04.231 --> 00:47:05.064
<v Speaker 4>this thing that's never stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the momentum's never gotten quiet </v>

1016
00:47:07.801 --> 00:47:08.634
<v Speaker 4>enough for them to really analyze it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they kept that guy alive with </v>

1017
00:47:11.401 --> 00:47:16.401
<v Speaker 4>somebody else's heart date?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They cut him open and put another dude's</v>

1018
00:47:16.501 --> 00:47:17.334
<v Speaker 4>heart inside of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is fucking crazy to think that </v>

1019
00:47:21.721 --> 00:47:24.210
<v Speaker 4>human beings can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could fix,</v>

1020
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:26.280
<v Speaker 4>they can take out your lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1021
00:47:26.281 --> 00:47:28.860
<v Speaker 4>They can replace your lungs with someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>else's lungs.</v>

1022
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.633
<v Speaker 4>I think that's all helpful to thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it because the more we lose that </v>

1023
00:47:34.571 --> 00:47:39.250
<v Speaker 4>attachment to this body as being like </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything but the machine,</v>

1024
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:42.760
<v Speaker 4>the machine that's going to allow us to </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience consciousness in the physical</v>

1025
00:47:42.761 --> 00:47:44.860
<v Speaker 4>form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when we really look at that,</v>

1026
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:48.400
<v Speaker 4>then that's going to be a helpful kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of metaphysical underpinning.</v>

1027
00:47:48.401 --> 00:47:53.401
<v Speaker 4>So we're not so caught up in these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in these elements that are causing us so</v>

1028
00:47:54.341 --> 00:47:56.470
<v Speaker 4>much discomfort and suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1029
00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:57.850
<v Speaker 4>We're not trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1030
00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:01.480
<v Speaker 4>And this idea of what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1031
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:02.973
<v Speaker 5>but like isn't it inevitable if they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they come up with bionic eyes to let </v>

1032
00:48:07.061 --> 00:48:07.894
<v Speaker 5>you stare at the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could watch netflix on them and </v>

1033
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:13.750

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:31.690
<v Speaker 5>It's the hardware upgrade.</v>

1047
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:47.340
<v Speaker 4>The upgrade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hardware and then we just gotta make</v>

1048
00:48:47.341 --> 00:48:51.120
<v Speaker 4>sure that we're upgrading the software </v>
<v Speaker 4>and eliminating the viruses,</v>

1049
00:48:51.121 --> 00:48:55.740
<v Speaker 4>wanting those system checks to get all </v>
<v Speaker 4>of these bad programs out of our head.</v>

1050
00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.740
<v Speaker 4>Get the better metaphysical truth </v>
<v Speaker 4>programs like,</v>

1051
00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.960
<v Speaker 4>like the platinum rule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>

1052
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.823
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody is you living a different </v>

1053
00:49:03.541 --> 00:49:04.860
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Treat him as such,</v>

1054
00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:05.963
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like get some of these other software </v>

1055
00:49:07.441 --> 00:49:09.660
<v Speaker 4>programs running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Discard the old ones.</v>

1056
00:49:09.661 --> 00:49:12.120
<v Speaker 4>Then upgrade the hardware all you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1057
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:14.040
<v Speaker 4>but both have to kind of come in </v>
<v Speaker 4>conjunction.</v>

1058
00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.100
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise we'll do what we did with </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>

1059
00:49:17.101 --> 00:49:17.934
<v Speaker 4>Elevating faster than consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Technology elevates fast and the </v>

1060
00:49:20.101 --> 00:49:22.410
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and we just fuck each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other up better.</v>

1061
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:23.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we definitely do that.</v>

1062
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.300
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

1063
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:29.070
<v Speaker 5>also technology is just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just trying to get us more and more</v>

1064
00:49:29.071 --> 00:49:31.740
<v Speaker 5>addicted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking of this the other day and</v>

1065
00:49:31.741 --> 00:49:32.574
<v Speaker 5>I was flying back from Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking of how many people I see </v>

1066
00:49:35.611 --> 00:49:36.444
<v Speaker 5>stare at a phone at the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the fucking mall and a restaurant </v>

1067
00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:44.700
<v Speaker 5>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm staring at my own phone.</v>

1068
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:45.470
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm mean,</v>

1069
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:46.303
<v Speaker 5>I'm not immune to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're all staring at fucking phones and </v>

1070
00:49:48.601 --> 00:49:50.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I was a pilgrim,</v>

1071
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.310
<v Speaker 5>if you took took,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you went back in a time machine,</v>

1072
00:49:53.311 --> 00:49:57.090
<v Speaker 5>he grabbed a pilgrim and you dragged </v>
<v Speaker 5>them to 2016 and you said,</v>

1073
00:49:57.091 --> 00:49:58.680
<v Speaker 5>what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'd be like,</v>

1074
00:49:58.681 --> 00:50:00.660
<v Speaker 5>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all,</v>

1075
00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:02.670
<v Speaker 5>they're all prisoners to the looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>glass.</v>

1076
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:05.850
<v Speaker 5>He'd been captured like do were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like threaten their spouse.</v>

1077
00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:06.713
<v Speaker 5>They're under her spell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They stare at a fucking glass screen </v>

1078
00:50:09.061 --> 00:50:09.990
<v Speaker 5>first thing in the morning.</v>

1079
00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:12.570
<v Speaker 5>They check their email to go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They stare at a screen.</v>

1080
00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.260
<v Speaker 5>They look at their navigation system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>While they're fucking driving to work.</v>

1081
00:50:16.261 --> 00:50:18.750
<v Speaker 5>They get home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They watched TV before they go to bed,</v>

1082
00:50:18.751 --> 00:50:22.230
<v Speaker 5>they check their email again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just staring at fucking screens.</v>

1083
00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.210
<v Speaker 5>They're living their lives through </v>
<v Speaker 5>screens.</v>

1084
00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:28.280
<v Speaker 5>I would think to looking glass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's captivated though.</v>

1085
00:50:28.281 --> 00:50:31.070
<v Speaker 5>I would think they were under the spell </v>
<v Speaker 5>of glass.</v>

1086
00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.110
<v Speaker 5>Like there was something about something</v>
<v Speaker 5>bond.</v>

1087
00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:33.973
<v Speaker 5>They're not moving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just sitting there in front of </v>

1088
00:50:35.181 --> 00:50:39.170
<v Speaker 5>this fucking thing all day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're almost does almost no movement.</v>

1089
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.080
<v Speaker 5>Almost all the time you're in front of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>screen.</v>

1090
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:43.770
<v Speaker 5>You're just sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1091
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:48.530
<v Speaker 5>If you saw that and you had no idea what</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fuck had television was or a phone,</v>

1092
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:51.230

<v Speaker 5>period and he said,</v>

<v Speaker 5>what do you think's going on?</v>

1094
00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:53.960
<v Speaker 5>Like with these fucking people are under</v>
<v Speaker 5>a spell.</v>

1095
00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:57.320

<v Speaker 5>Like it's giving them something.</v>

1096
00:50:57.321 --> 00:50:59.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's what a spell is and mean.</v>

1097
00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.930
<v Speaker 5>The fucking when the the the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hip dodick dancer dances in front of</v>

1098
00:51:02.931 --> 00:51:05.300
<v Speaker 5>you and then all of a sudden you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>even know where you are anymore.</v>

1099
00:51:05.301 --> 00:51:06.830
<v Speaker 5>It's cause you're looking at something </v>
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>

1100
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:08.020
<v Speaker 5>It's a strip club.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1101
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:09.300
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>

1102
00:51:09.301 --> 00:51:10.370
<v Speaker 5>Know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1103
00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:12.110
<v Speaker 5>You ate the edible did Joey Diaz gave </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1104
00:51:12.111 --> 00:51:14.410
<v Speaker 5>that was mislabeled on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1105
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:16.490
<v Speaker 5>this is what you're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

1106
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:21.500
<v Speaker 5>you're seeing something amazing and that</v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing thing is making you want more of</v>

1107
00:51:22.971 --> 00:51:23.804
<v Speaker 5>it so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're spending more money to get a </v>

1108
00:51:26.151 --> 00:51:30.110
<v Speaker 5>better computer to make better </v>
<v Speaker 5>explosions on the bigger screen that has</v>

1109
00:51:30.111 --> 00:51:30.944
<v Speaker 5>the better sound and it keeps going </v>
<v Speaker 5>deeper and deeper and every fucking new </v>

1110
00:51:33.921 --> 00:51:38.240
<v Speaker 5>phone has some new way to get chicks </v>
<v Speaker 5>excited and you're staring at the newest</v>

1111
00:51:38.241 --> 00:51:41.540
<v Speaker 5>and best screen and just locked into </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1112
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:45.890
<v Speaker 5>this sort of hypnotic trance of </v>
<v Speaker 5>technology.</v>

1113
00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:46.903
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it allowable allows you to Bluetooth </v>

1114
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:49.063
<v Speaker 5>with your navigation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So stone syncs up to your car and like </v>

1115
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:54.290
<v Speaker 5>you're still staring at a fucking screen</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not doing anything.</v>

1116
00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:58.340
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The same effect is taking place.</v>

1117
00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:00.140
<v Speaker 5>You're staring at a screen.</v>

1118
00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:01.793
<v Speaker 4>I think what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's interesting to me is I think </v>

1119
00:52:03.511 --> 00:52:04.344
<v Speaker 4>we're in this intermediary intermediary </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage where we're watching this rapid </v>

1120
00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:11.790
<v Speaker 4>advancement and things are getting more </v>
<v Speaker 4>and more interesting,</v>

1121
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:12.863
<v Speaker 4>but I think there's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>tipping point where technology is so </v>

1122
00:52:15.691 --> 00:52:18.360
<v Speaker 4>ubiquitous that will actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll,</v>

1123
00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:19.253
<v Speaker 4>it'll kind of settled into our lives in </v>
<v Speaker 4>a better way and maybe some people will </v>

1124
00:52:21.901 --> 00:52:22.734
<v Speaker 4>get completely lost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think a lot of us are already </v>

1125
00:52:24.721 --> 00:52:28.620
<v Speaker 4>reaching that point where it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>too much and it's forcing us to make our</v>

1126
00:52:28.621 --> 00:52:30.420
<v Speaker 4>own boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put our phone down.</v>

1127
00:52:30.421 --> 00:52:32.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this idea of put your phone away on this</v>

1128
00:52:32.851 --> 00:52:34.200
<v Speaker 4>retreat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no phones here.</v>

1129
00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:36.960
<v Speaker 4>We're starting to develop the counter </v>
<v Speaker 4>reaction to it,</v>

1130
00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:40.710
<v Speaker 4>but it has to get to the point of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous in order for us to do,</v>

1131
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have this kind of counter reaction.</v>

1132
00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:45.210
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the way it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's like using them.</v>

1133
00:52:45.211 --> 00:52:46.620
<v Speaker 4>Fred flintstones breaks</v>

1134

<v Speaker 5>Formula One car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good luck.</v>

1135
00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:51.510
<v Speaker 5>We're going to put our phone away for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole hour.</v>

1136
00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.510
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just sitting there and your bag.</v>

1137
00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:06.630
<v Speaker 4>Only the only hope that I have for that </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophy.</v>

1138
00:53:06.631 --> 00:53:07.464
<v Speaker 4>How was espousing is I like I learned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it's something at burning man </v>

1139
00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:15.350
<v Speaker 4>and burning and burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was,</v>

1140
00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:16.793
<v Speaker 4>it's so much shit like you have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't even fathom how many lit up </v>

1141
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:25.350
<v Speaker 4>amazingly beautiful fire breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>art creations,</v>

<v Speaker 2>This crazy amalgamation.</v>

1145
00:53:32.341 --> 00:53:33.174
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was in this like thunder dome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They rebuilt the thunderdome basically </v>

1146
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:37.943
<v Speaker 2>and they had people on bungee cords and </v>
<v Speaker 2>two topless chicks were smashing into </v>

1147
00:53:40.981 --> 00:53:41.814
<v Speaker 2>each other on bungee cords,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beating each other with foam sabres as </v>

1148
00:53:44.641 --> 00:53:45.474
<v Speaker 2>like house music played behind and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking fire breathing dragon car like </v>

1149
00:53:49.261 --> 00:53:53.340
<v Speaker 2>rode by breathing fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that is ridiculous.</v>

1150
00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:55.470
<v Speaker 2>Sounds awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

1151
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.810
<v Speaker 2>But what after you've been there for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>

1152
00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:58.853
<v Speaker 2>like you realize the Times that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy the most are getting high with </v>

1153
00:54:02.071 --> 00:54:03.990
<v Speaker 2>your homeys in the rv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1154
00:54:03.991 --> 00:54:04.824
<v Speaker 2>like that's the absolute best time you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a burning man and those like just </v>

1155
00:54:08.371 --> 00:54:11.760
<v Speaker 2>laughing and hanging and drinking a beer</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the rv.</v>

1156
00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's enhanced though by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the chaotic environment and the fact you</v>

1157
00:54:15.471 --> 00:54:16.860
<v Speaker 2>have this crazy feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1158
00:54:16.861 --> 00:54:18.540
<v Speaker 2>we're here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're here.</v>

1159
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:19.463
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of what goes on at a place </v>

1160
00:54:20.881 --> 00:54:21.481
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1161
00:54:21.481 --> 00:54:22.111
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1162
00:54:22.111 --> 00:54:23.000
<v Speaker 2>we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1163
00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:24.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of it contributes.</v>

1164
00:54:24.781 --> 00:54:29.430
<v Speaker 2>But then just realizing like we can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that rv moment anywhere.</v>

1165
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.050
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't need to be in burning </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1166
00:54:31.051 --> 00:54:33.210
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the most special shit.</v>

1167
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Like the most special shit is the simple</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1168
00:54:35.401 --> 00:54:38.430
<v Speaker 2>So you can take all this technology does</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this awesome stuff,</v>

1169
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:39.383
<v Speaker 2>but it's never going to be like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>hike or that time you're hanging and </v>

1170
00:54:42.411 --> 00:54:45.600
<v Speaker 2>playing with your kids or that time you </v>
<v Speaker 2>went fishing or that time.</v>

1171
00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.500
<v Speaker 2>It's never going to beat that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1172
00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:50.730
<v Speaker 2>And you start to realize that when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets to the ridiculous,</v>

1173
00:54:50.731 --> 00:54:54.180
<v Speaker 2>it's just when it's on this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intermediary level that it's hard for us</v>

1174
00:54:54.181 --> 00:54:55.050
<v Speaker 2>to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1175
00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think the only way to truly </v>

1176
00:54:57.871 --> 00:54:59.850
<v Speaker 2>appreciate the natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

1177
00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:03.840
<v Speaker 2>to truly appreciate the wonders of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural world is to,</v>

1178
00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.760
<v Speaker 2>to be engaged in it.</v>

1179
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:06.713
<v Speaker 2>Separate of the electronic world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're on some crazy hike but </v>

1180
00:55:10.321 --> 00:55:13.680
<v Speaker 2>you're also staring at your phone the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire time you're walking,</v>

1181
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.530
<v Speaker 2>you're just not going to get the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>

1182
00:55:16.531 --> 00:55:17.364
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're hiking in Yosemite and you </v>

1183
00:55:19.051 --> 00:55:22.950
<v Speaker 2>know some of those incredible views and </v>
<v Speaker 2>vistas and you're traveling around these</v>

1184
00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:24.203
<v Speaker 2>amazing nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like you're not going to really </v>

1185
00:55:26.041 --> 00:55:26.874
<v Speaker 2>take that in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're looking at your phone all the </v>

1186
00:55:28.171 --> 00:55:30.240
<v Speaker 2>time or thinking about what picture </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to take.</v>

1187
00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1188
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.020
<v Speaker 2>You got a bunch of selfies because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're inherently,</v>

1189
00:55:34.021 --> 00:55:34.854
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing about the phone that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the present moment unless something </v>

1190
00:55:37.141 --> 00:55:38.850
<v Speaker 2>is immediately popping up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1191
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.820
<v Speaker 2>It's all about the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How I look,</v>

1192
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:42.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the future,</v>

1193
00:55:42.961 --> 00:55:44.160
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to post?</v>

1194
00:55:44.161 --> 00:55:44.994
<v Speaker 2>What's going to come?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it takes you out of the present </v>

1195
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:47.633
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think present moment is really the </v>

1196
00:55:48.721 --> 00:55:53.380
<v Speaker 2>only pleasurable state that we have on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet is when your presence,</v>

1197
00:55:53.381 --> 00:55:58.381
<v Speaker 2>those fucking screens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man and your ego is just preen.</v>

1198
00:56:03.231 --> 00:56:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1199
00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.970
<v Speaker 2>Look up like 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>likes,</v>

1200
00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:09.910
<v Speaker 2>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>likes.</v>

1201
00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put filters on shit.</v>

1202
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Get that angle perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God get those.</v>

1203
00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:15.920
<v Speaker 2>It's so seductive though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1204
00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:18.570
<v Speaker 2>even before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even before there was,</v>

1205
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:20.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these phones and selfies,</v>

1206
00:56:20.101 --> 00:56:23.560
<v Speaker 2>there was paintings and then there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just your appearance in general.</v>

1207
00:56:23.561 --> 00:56:25.780
<v Speaker 2>So people would get seduced by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1208
00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:27.640
<v Speaker 2>their reflection in the mirror and </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking pretty good,</v>

1209
00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then all the way back,</v>

1210
00:56:29.531 --> 00:56:30.364
<v Speaker 2>maybe even before there was mirrors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was that time in the brook and </v>

1211
00:56:32.921 --> 00:56:34.380
<v Speaker 2>that's where you get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1212
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:39.070
<v Speaker 2>the myth of narcissus who just couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop looking at his reflection in the,</v>

1213
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:41.590
<v Speaker 2>in the waters of the Stream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1214
00:56:41.591 --> 00:56:45.100
<v Speaker 2>And that was like the original point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you start looking at yourself,</v>

1215
00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:47.590
<v Speaker 2>not ad sells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Separating yourself from self.</v>

1216
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:51.040
<v Speaker 2>You'll never be in the present moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll always be looking at yourself,</v>

1217
00:56:51.041 --> 00:56:51.880
<v Speaker 2>judging yourself.</v>

1218
00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:54.070
<v Speaker 2>And that's a game you can never fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>win.</v>

1219
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:54.993
<v Speaker 2>You're not gonna win that one bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>W W how much do you think it costs back </v>

1220
00:56:58.361 --> 00:56:59.194
<v Speaker 2>in the day to get your portrait painted?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you got your portrait painted </v>

1221
00:57:01.901 --> 00:57:05.180
<v Speaker 2>back in the Hellenic Saul's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are a bad motherfucker,</v>

1222
00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had some cash,</v>

1223
00:57:07.001 --> 00:57:08.040
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta,</v>

1224
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:08.883
<v Speaker 2>you sat there and looked regal with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>best clothes while some dude just </v>

1225
00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:15.940
<v Speaker 2>painted you for how long?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long does it take?</v>

1226
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:16.893
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would pose for marbled busts back </v>

1227
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:19.503
<v Speaker 2>even before then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you go back to the Roman and Greek </v>

1228
00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

1229
00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:28.060
<v Speaker 2>That's insane how long that takes three </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get carved in marble.</v>

1230
00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's insane.</v>

1231
00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:33.340
<v Speaker 2>And you can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the ego is so seductive.</v>

1232
00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:34.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want that.</v>

1233
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.553
<v Speaker 2>You want to portray that image and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is it's just always so </v>

1234
00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:39.124
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it never feels confident no matter </v>

1235
00:57:40.991 --> 00:57:42.760
<v Speaker 2>how wealthy you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how good looking you are.</v>

1236
00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:46.690
<v Speaker 2>It's always unshaking ground because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all nonsense.</v>

1237
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:48.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your consciousness.</v>

1238
00:57:48.071 --> 00:57:48.904
<v Speaker 2>And that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't need to be all of these </v>

1239
00:57:50.261 --> 00:57:52.570
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you do though.</v>

1240
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:56.320
<v Speaker 2>If you're that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd be that guy that sits there for the</v>

1241
00:57:56.321 --> 00:57:57.640
<v Speaker 2>bust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1242
00:57:57.641 --> 00:57:58.474
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in Rome and I was going </v>

1243
00:57:59.951 --> 00:58:01.290
<v Speaker 2>through the Vatican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1244
00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:02.163
<v Speaker 2>we were looking at all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>sculptures of like that there's no way </v>

1245
00:58:04.301 --> 00:58:06.820
<v Speaker 2>everyone was jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone was jacked.</v>

1246
00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>

1247
00:58:07.991 --> 00:58:08.824
<v Speaker 2>Everyone had a six pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so polite how they made everybody </v>

1248
00:58:12.401 --> 00:58:15.160
<v Speaker 2>with a small dicks and nobody felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know why they did that?</v>

1249
00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:16.960
<v Speaker 2>So nobody felt like it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1250
00:58:16.961 --> 00:58:17.321
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1251
00:58:17.321 --> 00:58:18.640
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interestingly enough,</v>

1252
00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:21.550
<v Speaker 2>I asked of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1253
00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:25.960
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy told me that in the Roman age it</v>

1254
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:27.670
<v Speaker 2>was considered a barbaric.</v>

1255
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:28.713
<v Speaker 2>If you had a big penis like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't a person of culture or </v>

1256
00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:35.230
<v Speaker 2>thought if you had a big penis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And whether he's correct or not,</v>

1257
00:58:35.231 --> 00:58:38.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure Jamie looked that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please.</v>

1258
00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:42.010
<v Speaker 2>But that's interesting that like these </v>
<v Speaker 2>little Dick dudes and say,</v>

1259
00:58:42.011 --> 00:58:43.540
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this big Dick thing,</v>

1260
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.450

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1261
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:49.270
<v Speaker 2>Don't get attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were all brutes and assholes.</v>

1262
00:58:49.271 --> 00:58:50.950
<v Speaker 2>That's why we're in this mess in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>

1263
00:58:50.951 --> 00:58:54.610
<v Speaker 2>It's all those big Dick assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want a solid,</v>

1264
00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:59.920
<v Speaker 2>a solid Roman Catholic government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You needed a little dick dude with a six</v>

1265
00:58:59.921 --> 00:59:01.480
<v Speaker 2>pack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just jacked.</v>

1266
00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.270
<v Speaker 2>The tits looks like GSP with a leaf over</v>
<v Speaker 2>his death.</v>

1267
00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:08.830
<v Speaker 2>The leaves were a lot of leads or put </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the Dick's later.</v>

1268
00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:10.650
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of the leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1269
00:59:10.651 --> 00:59:11.484
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like style of the leaf over the </v>

1270
00:59:12.671 --> 00:59:14.240
<v Speaker 2>deck posts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Constantine.</v>

1271
00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:15.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happened later after some religious </v>

1272
00:59:17.021 --> 00:59:17.854
<v Speaker 2>period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just decided to stop looking at </v>

1273
00:59:18.701 --> 00:59:19.451
<v Speaker 2>Dick's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just like,</v>

1274
00:59:19.451 --> 00:59:20.284
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has been in front of us the whole </v>

1275
00:59:20.801 --> 00:59:22.430
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>

1276
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:23.181
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1277
00:59:23.181 --> 00:59:23.970
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

1278
00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:24.803
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that classic example of let's make </v>

1279
00:59:26.391 --> 00:59:28.240
<v Speaker 1>something that we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1280
00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:30.240
<v Speaker 1>let's make that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1281
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:32.540
<v Speaker 1>that thing is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't have a big Dick.</v>

1282
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:33.793
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there were also the honest </v>

1283
00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:39.940
<v Speaker 1>inclination that guy's got a hog and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half though the devil.</v>

1284
00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:41.450
<v Speaker 1>He's the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1285
00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:45.800
<v Speaker 1>The demons always had giant dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want that girl,</v>

1286
00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:50.310
<v Speaker 1>that big Dick Demon Monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1287
00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's got a hog.</v>

1288
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Put it away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

1289
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Kind of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1290
00:59:56.991 --> 00:59:57.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1291
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:58.583
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just weird to think that they were </v>

1292
01:00:00.021 --> 01:00:04.730
<v Speaker 1>struggling between like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess a big Dick represented virility,</v>

1293
01:00:04.731 --> 01:00:07.550
<v Speaker 1>which represented conquest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which represented war,</v>

1294
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:08.563
<v Speaker 1>which represents a strife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all those big Dick dudes just </v>

1295
01:00:11.391 --> 01:00:14.150
<v Speaker 1>coming over the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking big shaggy beards,</v>

1296
01:00:14.151 --> 01:00:15.940
<v Speaker 1>swinging swords and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brennan.</v>

1297
01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:16.813
<v Speaker 1>The Gall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gotta stop this fighting himself and </v>

1298
01:00:18.621 --> 01:00:19.454
<v Speaker 1>yelling and his bear skins on mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 1>as he's looking at a line of </v>

1299
01:00:22.641 --> 01:00:23.740
<v Speaker 1>impenetrable shield.</v>

1300
01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.860
<v Speaker 1>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy.</v>

1301
01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1302
01:00:25.431 --> 01:00:29.300
<v Speaker 1>You don't want that guy and his giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick that thought we had a hawk or sure.</v>

1303
01:00:29.301 --> 01:00:34.301
<v Speaker 1>Just hair braided around like says Les </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pauls.</v>

1304
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:36.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if a girl tried to suck his dick </v>

1305
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:40.280
<v Speaker 1>literally sucking on one of those cat </v>
<v Speaker 1>posts,</v>

1306
01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:45.050
<v Speaker 1>it's just say Harry Dick Harry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1307
01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:47.870
<v Speaker 1>look what you imagine a Buffalo Dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be like,</v>

1308
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:48.733
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just random hairs hanging off of </v>

1309
01:00:51.261 --> 01:00:55.700
<v Speaker 1>the shaft of his Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just dreadlock barbarian Dick.</v>

1310
01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>He probably comes up a bright white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bright white light toothpaste.</v>

1311
01:01:01.551 --> 01:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Just raw is the moonlight and glow boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoots out.</v>

1312
01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Looks like bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like liquid bones from out of his dick.</v>

1313
01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:11.053
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have that guy around his milk </v>

1314
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:20.503
<v Speaker 1>deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a little dudes with six packs </v>

1315
01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:24.170
<v Speaker 1>that look like they could go gay at any </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment in time.</v>

1316
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Cause they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1317
01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:26.423
<v Speaker 1>Every one of them was just ready to suck</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cock and conveniently the dicks were </v>

1318
01:01:28.941 --> 01:01:29.774
<v Speaker 1>small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so nobody gagged if that's what was </v>

1319
01:01:31.161 --> 01:01:31.640
<v Speaker 1>going on too.</v>

1320
01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of Dick Sucking back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the guys who made,</v>

1321
01:01:33.831 --> 01:01:35.800
<v Speaker 1>it's just a friendly little dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1322
01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:36.643
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have those barbarian dicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with wonder when they realize you </v>

1323
01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:41.830
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't fuck dudes all the time when </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they realized when they were,</v>

1324
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.860
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

1325
01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>because people who essentially weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even gay,</v>

1326
01:01:45.621 --> 01:01:46.454
<v Speaker 1>we're fucking dude's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not there's anything wrong with being </v>

1327
01:01:48.051 --> 01:01:49.640
<v Speaker 1>gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just get that out of the way.</v>

1328
01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not judging in any way </v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality,</v>

1329
01:01:52.161 --> 01:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

1330
01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>less likely than being straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But back then that was on the case.</v>

1331
01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you were an actual gay person or</v>

1332
01:02:02.541 --> 01:02:03.830
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the question.</v>

1333
01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:04.933
<v Speaker 1>Were they gay people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are more gay people where they're </v>

1334
01:02:06.471 --> 01:02:09.080
<v Speaker 1>more bisexual people or was everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>greedy?</v>

1335
01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a combination.</v>

1336
01:02:12.111 --> 01:02:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I think we're naturally a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>bisexual then we act on because we're,</v>

1337
01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:19.040
<v Speaker 1>everybody's also naturally quite a bit</v>

1338
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.450
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of it.</v>

1339
01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:23.880
<v Speaker 2>But I also think they were fucking kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>back then.</v>

1340
01:02:23.881 --> 01:02:26.640
<v Speaker 2>And it was like there was like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>momentum of fucking kids.</v>

1341
01:02:26.641 --> 01:02:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're a kid and you get fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>by a dude,</v>

1342
01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:32.940
<v Speaker 2>like I think there's gotta be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlation there between,</v>

1343
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the desire to do the same thing.</v>

1344
01:02:35.161 --> 01:02:37.620
<v Speaker 2>It's just like if your dad beats you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you want to,</v>

1345
01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:39.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat when you're a dad.</v>

1346
01:02:39.181 --> 01:02:41.340
<v Speaker 2>It's this the same kind of an ingrained </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1347
01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:44.640
<v Speaker 2>And I think they just got this momentum </v>
<v Speaker 2>of kid fucking,</v>

1348
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:49.500
<v Speaker 2>and then that probably contributed along</v>
<v Speaker 2>with there's the open mindedness and not</v>

1349
01:02:49.501 --> 01:02:50.760
<v Speaker 2>being homophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually they,</v>

1350
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.210
<v Speaker 2>they sometimes are homophobic against </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who would receive the Dick,</v>

1351
01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:56.250
<v Speaker 2>but the people who were supplying the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick,</v>

1352
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.740
<v Speaker 2>it was like prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like prison basically.</v>

1353
01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole society was prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1354
01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:04.320
<v Speaker 2>cause if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're the pitcher you're not really,</v>

1355
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:05.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda normal.</v>

1356
01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1357
01:03:06.521 --> 01:03:07.970
<v Speaker 2>You just show the character of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>loads,</v>

1358
01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:08.440
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1359
01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.520
<v Speaker 2>and that was like one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at some of the graffiti when</v>

1360
01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:12.354
<v Speaker 2>Cesar was taking over power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some of the group for graffiti was </v>

1361
01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:18.480
<v Speaker 2>calling him like the catcher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh like Cesar,</v>

1362
01:03:18.481 --> 01:03:19.650
<v Speaker 2>you catch her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1363
01:03:19.651 --> 01:03:22.050
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever word that was for that,</v>

1364
01:03:22.051 --> 01:03:22.884
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that was still a slight like you </v>

1365
01:03:24.451 --> 01:03:28.530
<v Speaker 2>were supposed to at at the most virile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're head of the Roman legions,</v>

1366
01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:30.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be the pitcher.</v>

1367
01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.433
<v Speaker 2>When I was in high school and my friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy lawless I'm still friends with </v>

1368
01:03:33.301 --> 01:03:34.410
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that dude.</v>

1369
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:37.380
<v Speaker 2>But Jimmy Wallace was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a great name by the way.</v>

1370
01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:39.900
<v Speaker 2>It's right up there with Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>

1371
01:03:39.901 --> 01:03:42.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w we knew this dude who was bisexual and</v>

1372
01:03:42.441 --> 01:03:43.620
<v Speaker 2>we were kind of weirded out because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

1373
01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:45.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was 17 and Jimmy was 18.</v>

01:03:45.981 --> 01:03:47.010
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

1376
01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:49.524
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I believe in bisexuals.</v>

1379
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.660
<v Speaker 2>I think they're just greedy.</v>

1380
01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.720
<v Speaker 2>He started laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started laughing so hard cause he was</v>

1381
01:04:00.721 --> 01:04:04.440
<v Speaker 2>only like half serious but cause I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just greedy.</v>

1382
01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.713
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like so burned in my head as a 17 </v>

1383
01:04:10.141 --> 01:04:11.850
<v Speaker 2>year old that laughed at everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1384
01:04:11.851 --> 01:04:14.610
<v Speaker 2>I had a 17 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously stupid sense of humor.</v>

1385
01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:17.690
<v Speaker 2>And to this day if someone says </v>
<v Speaker 2>bisexual,</v>

1386
01:04:17.691 --> 01:04:21.740
<v Speaker 2>I just think of him going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well is this,</v>

1387
01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:24.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean humans have put their Dick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1388

<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

1389
01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:28.030
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's these couches for?</v>

1390
01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Cheap flashlights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1391
01:04:29.761 --> 01:04:30.571
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

1392
01:04:30.571 --> 01:04:31.620
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How we met.</v>

1393
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think we should clarify.</v>

1394
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:37.800
<v Speaker 2>Aubrey and I met when he worked for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flush,</v>

1395
01:04:37.801 --> 01:04:38.634
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't know that I'll be working </v>

1396
01:04:39.841 --> 01:04:41.970
<v Speaker 2>for a company that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fake vagina.</v>

1397
01:04:41.971 --> 01:04:44.910
<v Speaker 2>You have sexual gelatinous fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like man,</v>

1398
01:04:44.911 --> 01:04:46.230
<v Speaker 2>if something form with gelatin or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1399
01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:47.671
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chores.</v>

1400
01:04:47.671 --> 01:04:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Gelatin can't divulge family secrets.</v>

1401
01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.580
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1402
01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:53.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how we met Pete.</v>

1403
01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.940
<v Speaker 2>People love to just get rid of com and </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you feel better.</v>

1404
01:04:57.270 --> 01:05:00.660
<v Speaker 2>And I think we got to just remove all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking stigma about it.</v>

1405
01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's just,</v>

1406
01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:02.843
<v Speaker 2>it's the come release mechanism for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure monkey and that was actually </v>

1407
01:05:05.731 --> 01:05:06.564
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That word was something that came to me </v>

1408
01:05:07.801 --> 01:05:10.080
<v Speaker 2>actually my Wasco trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what we fucking are.</v>

1409
01:05:10.081 --> 01:05:10.914
<v Speaker 2>Where pleasure monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're here to soak in as much </v>

1410
01:05:13.831 --> 01:05:15.180
<v Speaker 2>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laughter,</v>

1411
01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 2>feel all the things that you can fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel to your</v>

1412
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.140
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hit all of the pleasure buttons.</v>

1413
01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.540
<v Speaker 4>Like why would you have a pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 4>button and not push it?</v>

1414
01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:26.380
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like push all of your pleasure buttons.</v>

1415
01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:27.214
<v Speaker 4>Let's feel what that feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go through and finish this </v>

1416
01:05:29.771 --> 01:05:32.680
<v Speaker 4>existence in the material form saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1417
01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.000
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was like,</v>

1418
01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:35.320
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to have that button.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1419
01:05:35.321 --> 01:05:36.460
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard that button was awesome,</v>

1420
01:05:36.461 --> 01:05:37.294
<v Speaker 4>but I just never pushed it because I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>afraid and it was a religion said this </v>

1421
01:05:39.221 --> 01:05:40.054
<v Speaker 4>thing and blah blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like fucking pushed the pleasure </v>

1422
01:05:41.831 --> 01:05:43.270
<v Speaker 4>buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like let's look shit.</v>

1423
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:44.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1424
01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:46.360
<v Speaker 4>recognize that that's what we're here </v>
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>

1425
01:05:46.361 --> 01:05:48.490
<v Speaker 4>And stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stop stressing so much about it.</v>

1426
01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:51.340
<v Speaker 4>Like the idea that you should be guilty </v>
<v Speaker 4>for your pleasure.</v>

1427
01:05:51.341 --> 01:05:53.920
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you do.</v>

1428
01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:54.813
<v Speaker 4>We still have the echoes of the puritans</v>
<v Speaker 4>that landed here and sort of tried to </v>

1429
01:05:57.611 --> 01:05:58.660
<v Speaker 4>reestablish</v>

1430
01:05:59.190 --> 01:06:03.960
<v Speaker 5>mean w w what's really similar to a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>of other crazy religious ideologies,</v>

1431
01:06:03.961 --> 01:06:04.794
<v Speaker 5>views on sex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like really rigid restrictive sex </v>

1432
01:06:06.691 --> 01:06:08.400
<v Speaker 5>practices,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1433
01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:12.540
<v Speaker 5>and that stuff's stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to shake that shit off.</v>

1434
01:06:12.541 --> 01:06:15.210
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to be grown adults like you </v>
<v Speaker 5>are with your friends,</v>

1435
01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:16.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you are with your friends,</v>

1436
01:06:16.861 --> 01:06:18.660
<v Speaker 5>you talk about sex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1437
01:06:18.690 --> 01:06:20.340
<v Speaker 5>it's just sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1438
01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:22.130
<v Speaker 5>it's what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It feels,</v>

1439
01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.250
<v Speaker 5>you don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1440
01:06:23.251 --> 01:06:24.930
<v Speaker 5>she wants sex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that dirty,</v>

1441
01:06:24.931 --> 01:06:28.380
<v Speaker 5>dirty demon possessed woman going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1442
01:06:28.381 --> 01:06:29.150
<v Speaker 5>look at her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's hot,</v>

1443
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:31.170
<v Speaker 5>but she wants to Dick all day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hot Girls.</v>

1444
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:33.750
<v Speaker 5>Like that's probably like what's going </v>
<v Speaker 5>on when you look at Jennifer Lopez,</v>

1445
01:06:33.751 --> 01:06:35.130
<v Speaker 5>his ass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that's,</v>

1446
01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.890
<v Speaker 5>that's the ass of a woman that probably </v>
<v Speaker 5>enjoys a dick.</v>

1447
01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:40.480
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd hope so dude up.</v>

1448
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:42.810
<v Speaker 5>So it seems like there's some system </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

1449
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:44.730
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It attracts them.</v>

1450
01:06:44.731 --> 01:06:45.690
<v Speaker 5>She probably likes them.</v>

1451
01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:49.470
<v Speaker 5>It's like a flower and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bees land on it and the flower wants</v>

1452
01:06:49.471 --> 01:06:50.740
<v Speaker 5>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1453
01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:53.280
<v Speaker 5>It's mutually the more fragrant the </v>
<v Speaker 5>flower,</v>

1454
01:06:53.281 --> 01:06:56.700
<v Speaker 5>the more it just desiring mutually </v>
<v Speaker 5>beneficial relationship.</v>

1455
01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:57.653
<v Speaker 5>But somewhere along the line people </v>
<v Speaker 5>decided to restrict it and they've </v>

1456
01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:00.423
<v Speaker 5>really clamped down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I and I think it was during the hard </v>

1457
01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:02.784
<v Speaker 5>times and I think it's just so much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so much to the restriction on </v>

1458
01:07:07.801 --> 01:07:08.634
<v Speaker 5>sex that I think also has to do with our</v>
<v Speaker 5>worrying about people not being able to </v>

1459
01:07:12.541 --> 01:07:13.374
<v Speaker 5>handle hard times if they come again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's a lot of people I think in </v>

1460
01:07:15.931 --> 01:07:16.764
<v Speaker 5>this world with the preppers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether people that are just concerned </v>

1461
01:07:18.631 --> 01:07:19.464
<v Speaker 5>about the future of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're really worried that people are </v>

1462
01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:23.603
<v Speaker 5>losing could.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And ironically it's funny because the </v>

1463
01:07:25.081 --> 01:07:25.914
<v Speaker 5>people that would be more restrictive </v>
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to sex and usually the </v>

1464
01:07:27.781 --> 01:07:28.614
<v Speaker 5>right wingers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the right wingers are least </v>

1465
01:07:30.151 --> 01:07:31.980
<v Speaker 5>concerned about environmental damage.</v>

1466
01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:36.810
<v Speaker 5>They're more concerned about fiscal </v>
<v Speaker 5>profits like currently and then the left</v>

1467
01:07:36.811 --> 01:07:37.644
<v Speaker 5>wing would be much more concerned with </v>
<v Speaker 5>environmental but much less restrictive </v>

1468
01:07:42.811 --> 01:07:45.190
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the,</v>

1469
01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:46.403
<v Speaker 5>the idea that you could just run around </v>
<v Speaker 5>having sex with whoever you want and </v>

1470
01:07:49.831 --> 01:07:53.100
<v Speaker 5>just experiencing pleasure and not </v>
<v Speaker 5>committing to people.</v>

1471
01:07:53.101 --> 01:07:53.934
<v Speaker 5>And having a good time and smoking a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little pot and drinking and dancing and </v>

1472
01:07:57.001 --> 01:08:00.000
<v Speaker 5>just enjoying life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not good for commerce,</v>

1473
01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.400
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not good for business.</v>

1474
01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:06.240
<v Speaker 5>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so if you want people to embrace the</v>

1475
01:08:06.241 --> 01:08:08.910
<v Speaker 5>same sort of level of materialism that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to need to make your bottom</v>

1476
01:08:08.911 --> 01:08:11.850
<v Speaker 5>line go up every year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to stop these fucking hippies</v>

1477
01:08:11.851 --> 01:08:14.700
<v Speaker 5>and their goddamn fucking dance out in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the desert.</v>

1478
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.030
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he</v>

1479
01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:19.520
<v Speaker 2>burning down the bullshit out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting back on our profits.</v>

1480
01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:20.653
<v Speaker 2>You got to look at that motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've also got to look at the </v>

1481
01:08:22.071 --> 01:08:24.590
<v Speaker 2>motivation of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of just control.</v>

1482
01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:25.733
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you take something that someone is </v>

1483
01:08:27.201 --> 01:08:30.050
<v Speaker 2>going to think about all the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1484
01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.033
<v Speaker 2>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then make him guilty for that and </v>

1485
01:08:32.631 --> 01:08:36.980
<v Speaker 2>make it as sin and make you the one who </v>
<v Speaker 2>can absolve them of that sin.</v>

1486
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:42.130
<v Speaker 2>You got him fucking locked like every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single human on planet earth is going to</v>

1487
01:08:42.621 --> 01:08:45.170
<v Speaker 2>sin and they're going to need you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rescue them from hell.</v>

1488
01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

1489
01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:50.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like the ultimate fucking rear </v>
<v Speaker 2>naked choke on the human psyche,</v>

1490
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:51.343
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because no one's going to be able to </v>

1491
01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:55.550
<v Speaker 2>stop themselves from having sexual urges</v>
<v Speaker 2>and thoughts.</v>

1492
01:08:55.730 --> 01:08:58.610
<v Speaker 2>And if your thoughts are a sin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the only one who can take it away</v>

1493
01:08:58.611 --> 01:09:01.670
<v Speaker 2>from its fucking the world's greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>con,</v>

1494
01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:05.690
<v Speaker 2>the world's greatest con might be making</v>
<v Speaker 2>prostitution illegal,</v>

1495
01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:06.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1496
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Like how do they figure out a way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can fuck anybody you want for free?</v>

1497
01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like it's illegal to fuck.</v>

1498
01:09:11.811 --> 01:09:13.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not like murder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1499
01:09:13.221 --> 01:09:14.600
<v Speaker 2>like you just can't go around killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1500
01:09:14.601 --> 01:09:17.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't care how much you pay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't go kill people.</v>

1501
01:09:17.091 --> 01:09:18.500
<v Speaker 2>That's not what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1502
01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:22.460
<v Speaker 2>we're civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you could just go get some coke,</v>

1503
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.280
<v Speaker 2>go to a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started doing shots of people.</v>

1504
01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:26.420
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're banging people.</v>

1505
01:09:26.421 --> 01:09:27.740
<v Speaker 2>You put beverly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even know them,</v>

1506
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:30.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're some fucking wild person,</v>

1507
01:09:30.441 --> 01:09:31.670
<v Speaker 2>you could just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a girl,</v>

1508
01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:32.504
<v Speaker 2>especially God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could travel from place to place to </v>

1509
01:09:34.701 --> 01:09:38.420
<v Speaker 2>place and give it away and just get dick</v>
<v Speaker 2>every anywhere you want.</v>

1510
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that is okay.</v>

1511
01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.660
<v Speaker 2>But if you go there and you actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange pieces of paper or coins,</v>

1512
01:09:45.230 --> 01:09:47.270
<v Speaker 2>that's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or bitcoins,</v>

1513
01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:49.580
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1514
01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Like how is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pick coin prostitute.</v>

1515
01:09:51.951 --> 01:09:54.770
<v Speaker 2>That's high level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more interested at high level.</v>

1516
01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:55.653
<v Speaker 2>If I can pay for very high level and pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>for my sex act with a bitcoin really </v>

1517
01:09:58.521 --> 01:09:59.900
<v Speaker 2>smart girl too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they show up.</v>

1518
01:10:00.150 --> 01:10:00.983
<v Speaker 2>They just see things differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think this is saying that you </v>

1519
01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:09.110
<v Speaker 2>could pay people for massages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could pay people to do your nails,</v>

1520
01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:10.003
<v Speaker 2>you can get pedicures and manicures and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have people do all sorts of </v>

1521
01:10:13.191 --> 01:10:14.024
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you wax you and just don't massage </v>

1522
01:10:15.931 --> 01:10:17.490
<v Speaker 2>your Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1523
01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:19.370
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1524
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.863
<v Speaker 2>honestly I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this special distinction that that </v>

1525
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:26.570
<v Speaker 2>religion has given him the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some consequences of sex.</v>

1526
01:10:26.571 --> 01:10:30.050
<v Speaker 2>There's potential pregnancy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've mostly eradicated that.</v>

1527
01:10:30.051 --> 01:10:32.000
<v Speaker 2>If you're really trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least if you're trying,</v>

1528
01:10:32.001 --> 01:10:33.960
<v Speaker 2>you can eradicate that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that issue in there.</v>

1529
01:10:33.961 --> 01:10:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some diseases,</v>

1530
01:10:35.271 --> 01:10:36.380
<v Speaker 2>so there's some consequences.</v>

1531
01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:36.951
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

1532
01:10:36.951 --> 01:10:39.830
<v Speaker 2>it's a little different than a massage </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're less likely to get,</v>

1533
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.930
<v Speaker 2>you know anything of where it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>condom.</v>

1534
01:10:41.931 --> 01:10:44.620
<v Speaker 2>You filthy animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost zero disease problems,</v>

1535
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:45.463
<v Speaker 2>but the amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of difference that people </v>

1536
01:10:47.001 --> 01:10:47.834
<v Speaker 2>give that to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you imagine your girl getting </v>

1537
01:10:49.461 --> 01:10:50.750
<v Speaker 2>massage from a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1538
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:52.880
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he massages her vagina.</v>

1539
01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stomach,</v>

1540
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:56.263
<v Speaker 2>the stomach feel funny and you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Puke and you want to fight them and you </v>

<v Speaker 2>want to stab him in the throat for </v>
<v Speaker 2>touching your girl and you just think </v>

<v Speaker 2>how wet she probably was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't believe how naughty this </v>

1543
01:11:07.341 --> 01:11:08.174
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's probably leaking down the side of </v>

1544
01:11:09.591 --> 01:11:11.330
<v Speaker 2>her legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>

1546
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.360
<v Speaker 1>his thumb just gently rubbed up against </v>
<v Speaker 1>her assholes.</v>

1547
01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Jill toes spread out under feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cramped up,</v>

1548
01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Jesus and everybody felt so naughty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>naughty,</v>

<v Speaker 4>We just got it all,</v>

1554
01:11:38.601 --> 01:11:41.750
<v Speaker 4>look at each other and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all just fucking pleasure monkeys.</v>

1555
01:11:41.751 --> 01:11:44.360
<v Speaker 4>It's cool where you get your pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not your pleasure dealer.</v>

1556

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's love each other and just</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1558
01:11:47.961 --> 01:11:48.794
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't close to that in the 60s for </v>

1559
01:11:51.411 --> 01:11:52.610
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1560
01:11:52.611 --> 01:11:53.444
<v Speaker 1>You think about the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fifties in the 60s I think about </v>

1561
01:11:55.491 --> 01:11:56.324
<v Speaker 1>like the people in the 50s were all like</v>
<v Speaker 1>locked down watching Hawaii five o and </v>

1562
01:11:59.391 --> 01:12:00.224
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well actually that was probably the 60s </v>

1563
01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:02.690
<v Speaker 1>dragnet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was trying to think of.</v>

1564
01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the dragnet thing drag </v>
<v Speaker 1>net Guy Joe Friday?</v>

1565
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It was talking to some fucking Hippie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some God damn hippie and he's explaining</v>

1566
01:12:10.791 --> 01:12:13.760
<v Speaker 1>to the Hippie uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how easy they have it and how,</v>

1567
01:12:13.761 --> 01:12:18.020
<v Speaker 1>how lucky they should they feel living </v>
<v Speaker 1>in America today.</v>

1568
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:18.883
<v Speaker 1>What all the people that have sacrificed</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much to allow them to dress like </v>

1569
01:12:21.471 --> 01:12:22.304
<v Speaker 1>silly people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so hilarious cause it sounds </v>

1570
01:12:24.081 --> 01:12:27.610
<v Speaker 1>like a person to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it like listen to this is fat and I'm</v>

1571
01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:30.800
<v Speaker 1>selfish and you the first generation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come along with felt dissatisfied.</v>

1572
01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:33.560
<v Speaker 1>They all have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know about different things.</v>

1573
01:12:33.561 --> 01:12:36.200
<v Speaker 1>And most of them didn't have the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity in the freedoms that you do.</v>

1574
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most places in the world,</v>

1575
01:12:38.961 --> 01:12:41.390
<v Speaker 1>that's not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a way of life and rights.</v>

1576
01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:42.563
<v Speaker 1>They're to give you a blank stare </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they may not know what you're </v>

1577
01:12:44.001 --> 01:12:44.834
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is more people are living </v>

1578
01:12:46.731 --> 01:12:50.360
<v Speaker 1>better right here than anywhere else </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever before in history is I don't expect</v>

1579
01:12:50.361 --> 01:12:52.760
<v Speaker 1>us to roll over and play dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say you're dissatisfied,</v>

1580
01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:53.893
<v Speaker 1>it's not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a great deal better than when </v>

1581
01:12:54.801 --> 01:12:57.250
<v Speaker 1>we grew up a hundred men standing on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stoop,</v>

1582
01:12:58.210 --> 01:12:59.043
<v Speaker 1>Peckham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Friday's in a purple fucking </v>

1583
01:13:01.991 --> 01:13:02.824
<v Speaker 1>strictly and tars talking down to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're the dudes in the back of </v>

1584
01:13:08.421 --> 01:13:10.710
<v Speaker 1>the Jimi Hendrix pan that nobody can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you their name.</v>

1585
01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's like Jimi Hendrix and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes he was with and I'm sure if you're</v>

1586
01:13:16.251 --> 01:13:19.070
<v Speaker 1>fucking heavy duty music had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're mad at me right now.</v>

1587
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:20.660
<v Speaker 1>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

1588
01:13:20.661 --> 01:13:24.860
<v Speaker 1>this giant Jimi Hendrix Fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously giant.</v>

1589
01:13:24.861 --> 01:13:26.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who the fuck he toured </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1590
01:13:26.811 --> 01:13:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who those dudes were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

1591
01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.073
<v Speaker 4>People when they see other people having</v>
<v Speaker 4>fun and they don't feel like they can </v>

1592
01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:34.640
<v Speaker 4>get there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to shit on it.</v>

1593
01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:35.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like,</v>

1594
01:13:35.751 --> 01:13:39.320
<v Speaker 4>that's like these got looking at having </v>
<v Speaker 4>all this sex get an eye,</v>

1595
01:13:39.321 --> 01:13:41.450
<v Speaker 4>they look happy as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's going to,</v>

1596
01:13:41.451 --> 01:13:42.284
<v Speaker 4>cause it's that resistance towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards joining it that if the actually </v>

1597
01:13:45.651 --> 01:13:47.600
<v Speaker 4>just relaxed and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and did it,</v>

1598
01:13:47.601 --> 01:13:48.434
<v Speaker 4>they'd probably feel good but they can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow they feel like they can or they </v>

1599
01:13:50.271 --> 01:13:51.104
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't and they won't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the reaction is to remove that thing </v>

1600
01:13:53.181 --> 01:13:56.900
<v Speaker 4>to squash that thing to make it more </v>
<v Speaker 4>like them so that it feels so they don't</v>

1601
01:13:56.901 --> 01:13:58.160
<v Speaker 4>have that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1602
01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:59.880
<v Speaker 4>those eyes that are looking over there </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

1603
01:13:59.881 --> 01:14:00.714
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe that life's better and what's </v>

1604
01:14:01.191 --> 01:14:02.750
<v Speaker 4>wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How come I can't do that?</v>

1605
01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:03.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so people shit on it.</v>

1606
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I think the lines are being blurred </v>
<v Speaker 1>though between like uh,</v>

1607
01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:12.260
<v Speaker 1>really like hardcore no nonsense people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Joe Friday type character and the</v>

1608
01:14:14.471 --> 01:14:16.530
<v Speaker 1>hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines are getting like,</v>

1609
01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:19.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that like go in </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird slots.</v>

1610
01:14:19.361 --> 01:14:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Like how'd that guy get in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1611
01:14:20.741 --> 01:14:23.320
<v Speaker 1>he's in a weird spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's kind of both of those things.</v>

1612
01:14:23.321 --> 01:14:26.530
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of those people now that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really lock them down.</v>

1613
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:27.364
<v Speaker 1>He can't say this is a right wing person</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a left wing person is a no nonsense </v>

1614
01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:32.470
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get to work person.</v>

1615
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:33.363
<v Speaker 1>And this is a pothead and this is a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>likes to do mushrooms and this is a guy </v>

1616
01:14:36.341 --> 01:14:38.800
<v Speaker 1>who gets up in the morning and runs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might be the same dude now.</v>

1617
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.753
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of like crossover </v>
<v Speaker 1>between people who are like very </v>

1618
01:14:43.151 --> 01:14:43.984
<v Speaker 1>disciplined hard workers but also </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience pleasure and also understand </v>

1619
01:14:46.991 --> 01:14:47.824
<v Speaker 1>that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are a temporary life form hurling </v>

1620
01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:51.880
<v Speaker 1>through infinity.</v>

1621
01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Wake the fuck up and just have fun and </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy this because this is madness.</v>

1622
01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:59.950
<v Speaker 1>And it could very well be over at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blink of an eye,</v>

1623
01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:01.083
<v Speaker 1>a fucking giant rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The size of Pittsburgh can come flying </v>

1624
01:15:04.121 --> 01:15:04.954
<v Speaker 1>out of the north and no one catches it </v>
<v Speaker 1>until it's too late and it slams into </v>

1625
01:15:08.531 --> 01:15:11.770
<v Speaker 1>the fucking polar ice cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're diggity diggity done.</v>

1626
01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:13.720
<v Speaker 1>We're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1627
01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:15.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like 50 of us left.</v>

1628
01:15:15.701 --> 01:15:17.200
<v Speaker 1>We eat each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1629
01:15:17.201 --> 01:15:19.180
<v Speaker 1>we turned into mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing,</v>

1630
01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:21.813
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's keeping us from engaging in all </v>

1631
01:15:25.151 --> 01:15:25.984
<v Speaker 1>of these other forms that we went to is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this clinging to identity and these and </v>

1632
01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:30.070
<v Speaker 1>these fear programs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like,</v>

1633
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:33.820
<v Speaker 1>we ditch all that then then you just get</v>
<v Speaker 1>wide open for everything else.</v>

1634
01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:37.060
<v Speaker 1>And it's not a new idea like the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the warrior poet,</v>

1635
01:15:37.090 --> 01:15:37.923
<v Speaker 1>the idea back then if someone who could </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to battle and like Musashi who could </v>

1636
01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:42.003
<v Speaker 1>be the best swordsman and also be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best calligrapher and also a writer and </v>

1637
01:15:44.681 --> 01:15:46.630
<v Speaker 1>also meditate and also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1638
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:50.230
<v Speaker 1>have affairs and also do whatever like </v>
<v Speaker 1>passionate love affair,</v>

1639
01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:53.530
<v Speaker 1>all of the things like at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>point people realize like,</v>

1640
01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.060
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things is best.</v>

1641
01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:57.670
<v Speaker 1>And then at a certain point now in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

1642
01:15:57.850 --> 01:15:58.683
<v Speaker 1>or at least getting to here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like you have to identify with </v>

1643
01:16:01.361 --> 01:16:04.900
<v Speaker 1>this one thing and that's your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you defend that thing and,</v>

1644
01:16:05.150 --> 01:16:06.140
<v Speaker 1>and Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1645
01:16:06.141 --> 01:16:08.110
<v Speaker 1>chuck and enjoy all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1646
01:16:08.111 --> 01:16:11.650
<v Speaker 1>what I realized from Musashi when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1647
01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I think I was in my teens when I read </v>
<v Speaker 1>the book of five rings the first time,</v>

1648
01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:20.680
<v Speaker 1>what I realized is that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining this concept that was totally</v>

1649
01:16:20.681 --> 01:16:23.650
<v Speaker 1>alien to me at the time as like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>insecure teenager.</v>

1650
01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:29.220
<v Speaker 1>He was explaining this concept of to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced at anything,</v>

1651
01:16:29.561 --> 01:16:31.690
<v Speaker 1>to be like at your best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at anything,</v>

1652
01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.830
<v Speaker 1>you have to have no loose ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be loving,</v>

1653
01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:38.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to be kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be an artist,</v>

1654
01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.193
<v Speaker 1>you have to be creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you also have to be ruthless with </v>

1655
01:16:42.401 --> 01:16:43.234
<v Speaker 1>your sword technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to be ruthless with your </v>

1656
01:16:45.221 --> 01:16:48.070
<v Speaker 1>psychology and how you engage with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy and you,</v>

1657
01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:49.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a fascinating,</v>

1658
01:16:49.721 --> 01:16:50.554
<v Speaker 1>fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got bored fighting people with </v>

1659
01:16:52.601 --> 01:16:53.550
<v Speaker 1>swords.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he stopped,</v>

1660
01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:57.730
<v Speaker 1>he started using oars from boats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start fucking people up with oars.</v>

1661
01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:58.833
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just tired of fucking these bitches </v>

1662
01:16:59.951 --> 01:17:00.784
<v Speaker 1>up with swords.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He killed 62 people and one on one </v>

1663
01:17:03.221 --> 01:17:06.370
<v Speaker 1>combat with weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1664
01:17:06.490 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 1>And along the way he developed this </v>
<v Speaker 1>really</v>

1665
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:10.993
<v Speaker 5>intense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very rigid sort of guideline for </v>

1666
01:17:15.141 --> 01:17:19.520
<v Speaker 5>maintaining the ultimate warrior spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was a balanced perspective.</v>

1667
01:17:19.521 --> 01:17:20.354
<v Speaker 5>It was really weird because I remember </v>
<v Speaker 5>reading about that at the time and I </v>

1668
01:17:23.781 --> 01:17:26.540
<v Speaker 5>thought he just had to be a killer man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought you had to be,</v>

1669
01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:29.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you had to be like Roberto Duran when he</v>

1670
01:17:29.241 --> 01:17:31.010
<v Speaker 5>was young.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You had to be just a savage.</v>

1671
01:17:31.011 --> 01:17:32.570
<v Speaker 5>Like that was the only way to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighter.</v>

1672
01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:35.660
<v Speaker 5>He had to be a savage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd be just someone who just came in,</v>

1673
01:17:35.661 --> 01:17:37.400
<v Speaker 5>just guns blazing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't give a fuck.</v>

1674
01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:38.960
<v Speaker 5>Like Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the early days,</v>

1675
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:41.000
<v Speaker 5>there was the only way to be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I thought.</v>

1676
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:42.760
<v Speaker 5>And what he was saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1677
01:17:42.761 --> 01:17:44.790
<v Speaker 5>you have to be a master of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

1678
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:49.340
<v Speaker 5>The master of all aspects of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's no,</v>

1679
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:50.203
<v Speaker 5>there's no more terrifying form of </v>
<v Speaker 5>combat than one on one with a fucking </v>

1680
01:17:52.611 --> 01:17:53.780
<v Speaker 5>sword.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1681
01:17:53.781 --> 01:17:54.614
<v Speaker 5>he was the master.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was the guy that figured it out in a </v>

1682
01:17:56.690 --> 01:17:57.523
<v Speaker 5>very strange time in Japanese history </v>
<v Speaker 5>where he was a Ronin just traveling </v>

1683
01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:03.320
<v Speaker 5>around fucking killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1684
01:18:03.321 --> 01:18:04.154
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1685
01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.013
<v Speaker 4>I think some of these times when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>look back some of the philosophies that </v>

1686
01:18:08.451 --> 01:18:10.970
<v Speaker 4>developed her or even more advanced than</v>
<v Speaker 4>ours,</v>

1687
01:18:10.971 --> 01:18:13.520
<v Speaker 4>because when you have a strong external </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure,</v>

1688
01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:17.030
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the likelihood of a sword battle to</v>

1689
01:18:17.031 --> 01:18:17.910
<v Speaker 4>the death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1690
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:18.763
<v Speaker 4>That forms this point of resistance </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you got to cut out a lot of the </v>

1691
01:18:20.991 --> 01:18:22.160
<v Speaker 4>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the bullshit.</v>

1692
01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:25.700
<v Speaker 4>Like you really have to look at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world in a different way.</v>

1693
01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.680
<v Speaker 4>And even when there was the threat of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of fighting somebody at any point,</v>

1694
01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that changes how you are as a man,</v>

1695
01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:34.213
<v Speaker 4>like that chain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an external point of resistance </v>

1696
01:18:35.901 --> 01:18:38.750
<v Speaker 4>that causes you to understand certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>things about,</v>

1697
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:41.240
<v Speaker 4>about the nature of life and the nature </v>
<v Speaker 4>of your manhood.</v>

1698
01:18:41.241 --> 01:18:42.074
<v Speaker 4>Whereas now we have so little external </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure like most of us can go through </v>

1699
01:18:46.341 --> 01:18:47.840
<v Speaker 4>life and never get in a fight.</v>

1700
01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:48.973
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not something that it's in a lot </v>

1701
01:18:49.701 --> 01:18:51.590
<v Speaker 4>of people's lives still in some people's</v>
<v Speaker 4>lives.</v>

1702
01:18:51.591 --> 01:18:52.424
<v Speaker 4>For sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like you're removed from these </v>

1703
01:18:54.171 --> 01:18:57.470
<v Speaker 4>different things and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and sports offer that and kind of a very</v>

1704
01:18:57.471 --> 01:18:58.304
<v Speaker 4>controlled way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you take away all of these external </v>

1705
01:19:00.831 --> 01:19:01.664
<v Speaker 4>pressures and then you get read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets really squirly because you have </v>

1706
01:19:04.521 --> 01:19:07.370
<v Speaker 4>nothing to define yourself against.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have any resistance.</v>

1707
01:19:07.371 --> 01:19:10.580
<v Speaker 4>You're like lifting weights on the moon </v>
<v Speaker 4>and no matter what you try to do,</v>

1708
01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:13.430
<v Speaker 4>you can't get a fucking squat right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's no gravity.</v>

1709
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:14.600
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1710
01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:15.733
<v Speaker 4>and so you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to go out and I think actively </v>

1711
01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:21.170
<v Speaker 4>put yourself in situations that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to challenge you,</v>

1712
01:19:21.171 --> 01:19:23.240
<v Speaker 4>going to test you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it doesn't all have to be physical.</v>

1713
01:19:23.241 --> 01:19:24.074
<v Speaker 4>That's just one way in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find yourself in challenging mental </v>

1714
01:19:26.271 --> 01:19:27.104
<v Speaker 4>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find yourself in challenging emotional </v>

1715
01:19:28.821 --> 01:19:29.654
<v Speaker 4>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotionally challenging physical </v>

1716
01:19:30.951 --> 01:19:33.380
<v Speaker 4>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pulling crazy relationships.</v>

1717
01:19:33.381 --> 01:19:35.260
<v Speaker 4>Do they started fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1718
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:36.223
<v Speaker 4>They put,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they build up challenging emotional </v>

1719
01:19:38.091 --> 01:19:38.924
<v Speaker 4>situations who they can escape them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make their own obstacle course to </v>

1720
01:19:41.631 --> 01:19:43.010
<v Speaker 4>get through life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1721
01:19:43.011 --> 01:19:43.910
<v Speaker 4>you're totally right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1722
01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:45.440
<v Speaker 4>I think we're good.</v>

1723
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:48.690
<v Speaker 5>We're just experiencing an UN,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the safest time ever.</v>

1724
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:49.583
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we're sort of trying to find demons </v>

1725
01:19:52.021 --> 01:19:52.860
<v Speaker 5>don't exist instead of</v>

1726
01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.590
<v Speaker 4>on the ones that do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1727
01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:57.510
<v Speaker 4>And that's to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I mentioned it a couple times,</v>

1728
01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:00.220
<v Speaker 4>but do you know if you're interested in </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanting to tell that story,</v>

1729
01:20:00.490 --> 01:20:01.323
<v Speaker 4>but about the time I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasco because these plant medicines </v>

1730
01:20:04.090 --> 01:20:07.620
<v Speaker 4>are that form of resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is a bit of a trial by fire.</v>

1731
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1732
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.710
<v Speaker 2>it's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to confront yourself with,</v>

1733
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:12.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the darkest,</v>

1734
01:20:12.691 --> 01:20:15.810
<v Speaker 2>deepest fears and concerns that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

1735
01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:16.680
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1736
01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:19.020
<v Speaker 2>and that's the process by which it makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better.</v>

1737
01:20:19.021 --> 01:20:19.980
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1738
01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:21.540
<v Speaker 2>a magic potion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

1739
01:20:21.541 --> 01:20:24.570
<v Speaker 2>here's resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to respond?</v>

1740
01:20:24.571 --> 01:20:27.480
<v Speaker 2>And when you respond through that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>

1741
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:29.010
<v Speaker 2>you just get better from it and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1742
01:20:29.011 --> 01:20:30.630
<v Speaker 2>you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder with,</v>

1743
01:20:30.631 --> 01:20:31.464
<v Speaker 2>with California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this latest recreational marijuana </v>

1744
01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:35.693
<v Speaker 2>marijuana law passed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how long it'll be before </v>

1745
01:20:37.891 --> 01:20:42.060
<v Speaker 2>someone tries to do some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic clinic,</v>

1746
01:20:42.061 --> 01:20:42.894
<v Speaker 2>whether it's for a addiction to opiates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a and a Boogie Boga I began a </v>

1747
01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:52.830
<v Speaker 2>clinic or um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this kratom stuff,</v>

1748
01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:53.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1749
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:55.530
<v Speaker 2>there's shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about this?</v>

1750
01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think I did a podcast with Chris</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bell the other day.</v>

1751
01:20:58.860 --> 01:20:59.693
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to explain it to me and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me Kratom in mild doses it Kratom or is </v>

1752
01:21:03.541 --> 01:21:03.960
<v Speaker 2>it creative?</v>

1753
01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kratom Kratom I'm not,</v>

1754
01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even,</v>

1755
01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:09.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm in mild doses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be like,</v>

1756
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:11.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bit of an energy.</v>

1757
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:12.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Energy buzz.</v>

1758
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:13.583
<v Speaker 2>And then in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in heavier doses it seems to be more </v>

1759
01:21:15.481 --> 01:21:16.314
<v Speaker 2>like a painkiller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's almost like a slightly </v>

1760
01:21:18.901 --> 01:21:22.740
<v Speaker 2>euphoric but numbed sensations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really interesting plant.</v>

1761
01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:24.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly I don't think there's any reason</v>

1762
01:21:24.391 --> 01:21:25.224
<v Speaker 2>for it to be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't found personally a ton of </v>

1763
01:21:27.391 --> 01:21:29.940
<v Speaker 2>value from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I find value in some other things.</v>

1764
01:21:29.941 --> 01:21:30.774
<v Speaker 2>But the only thing I found disturbing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said I was getting a bunch of text </v>

1765
01:21:33.181 --> 01:21:34.014
<v Speaker 2>messages from people or tweets rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>from people that were telling me that </v>

1766
01:21:36.841 --> 01:21:39.420
<v Speaker 2>they had some addictive experiences with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1767
01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:42.090
<v Speaker 2>that it was very addicted to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>addictive to them.</v>

1768
01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.710
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know if that's true or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1769
01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:48.060
<v Speaker 2>I also don't know where you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and what's in it.</v>

1770
01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:48.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1771
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:52.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't exactly know how pure that stuff</v>

1772
01:21:52.501 --> 01:21:52.801
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1773
01:21:52.801 --> 01:21:55.650
<v Speaker 2>this stuff is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like a retail version of it.</v>

1774
01:21:55.890 --> 01:21:58.680
<v Speaker 2>The Guy who sells it came with Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I trust that.</v>

1775
01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:00.053
<v Speaker 2>But if you're buying it from a dealer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like essentially what a lot of </v>

1776
01:22:02.821 --> 01:22:04.400
<v Speaker 2>people had to do for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

1777
01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>

1778
01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's coming from Indonesia or wherever </v>

1779
01:22:08.761 --> 01:22:10.740
<v Speaker 2>it's from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see some real tests done</v>

1780
01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:12.000
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1781
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:12.930
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried it.</v>

1782
01:22:12.931 --> 01:22:14.850
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like a mild stimulant.</v>

1783
01:22:14.851 --> 01:22:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I kept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of feels okay.</v>

1784
01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1785
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:18.863
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting once you opened the </v>

1786
01:22:19.741 --> 01:22:22.440
<v Speaker 2>doors to that scientific method with </v>
<v Speaker 2>these plants,</v>

1787
01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:24.383
<v Speaker 2>you find the amazing results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's what we're seeing in </v>

1788
01:22:26.401 --> 01:22:27.234
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this revolution of understanding of </v>

1789
01:22:28.281 --> 01:22:28.920
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics.</v>

1790
01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Like I just read an and tweeted about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>study on,</v>

1791
01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:32.693
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both silicide been an MDA for like </v>

1792
01:22:34.771 --> 01:22:37.360
<v Speaker 2>social anxiety and social anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1793
01:22:37.410 --> 01:22:38.243
<v Speaker 2>which are one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of the classic school shooters </v>

1794
01:22:40.001 --> 01:22:40.621
<v Speaker 2>syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1795
01:22:40.621 --> 01:22:43.620
<v Speaker 2>it's this feeling of being excluded from</v>
<v Speaker 2>your tribe,</v>

1796
01:22:43.621 --> 01:22:44.454
<v Speaker 2>excluded from the social situation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the anxious and anxiety and all of the </v>

1797
01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:50.430
<v Speaker 2>medications that are prescribed for </v>
<v Speaker 2>these different feelings of feeling like</v>

1798
01:22:50.431 --> 01:22:51.960
<v Speaker 2>you're not part of the group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1799
01:22:51.961 --> 01:22:52.794
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to test that with both mgma </v>
<v Speaker 2>and with silicide siliciden and they </v>

1800
01:22:57.121 --> 01:22:59.430
<v Speaker 2>found that it was effective with both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but differently.</v>

1801
01:22:59.431 --> 01:23:01.230
<v Speaker 2>So they created this game called Cyber </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ball,</v>

1802
01:23:01.231 --> 01:23:02.064
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where they had what seemed like just </v>

1803
01:23:03.481 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>random other test subjects all in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>circle</v>

1804
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:07.450
<v Speaker 4>with a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1805
01:23:07.451 --> 01:23:10.450
<v Speaker 4>but really it was researchers and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>one test subject.</v>

1806
01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:11.793
<v Speaker 4>And so to create social anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would play this game of catch and </v>

1807
01:23:14.621 --> 01:23:17.710
<v Speaker 4>just not pass the ball hardly ever to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the test subject.</v>

1808
01:23:17.711 --> 01:23:19.660
<v Speaker 4>So We'd feel eventually like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1809
01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:20.494
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why aren't these people passing me the </v>

1810
01:23:22.091 --> 01:23:23.800
<v Speaker 4>ball?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what's wrong with me?</v>

1811
01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:27.880
<v Speaker 4>And so they tapped into some and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>would test that at baseline is placebo,</v>

1812
01:23:27.881 --> 01:23:28.420
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1813
01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.700
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least in the kind of concern of like,</v>

1814
01:23:30.701 --> 01:23:31.540
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's wrong with me?</v>

1815
01:23:31.541 --> 01:23:33.070
<v Speaker 4>Why do these people not want to give you</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ball?</v>

1816
01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:35.320
<v Speaker 4>And then they tested the baseline for </v>
<v Speaker 4>Placebo,</v>

1817
01:23:35.321 --> 01:23:37.540
<v Speaker 4>gave him the whatever placebo they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>using,</v>

1818
01:23:37.690 --> 01:23:38.523
<v Speaker 4>and then they tested it with psilocybin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what they found with silicide been </v>

1819
01:23:41.530 --> 01:23:45.550
<v Speaker 4>was that it dramatically reduced their </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of anxiety,</v>

1820
01:23:45.551 --> 01:23:48.300
<v Speaker 4>their angst or stress about not giving </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ball there.</v>

1821
01:23:48.301 --> 01:23:50.140
<v Speaker 4>They were just looking at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1822
01:23:50.141 --> 01:23:50.974
<v Speaker 4>look at these people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just don't want to pass me the </v>

1823
01:23:51.881 --> 01:23:53.470
<v Speaker 4>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>

1824
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:55.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so and so,</v>

1825
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:59.530
<v Speaker 4>but they could accurately tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now Mdm may also reduce social anxiety,</v>

1826
01:23:59.531 --> 01:24:00.364
<v Speaker 4>but in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The People Mtma thought they were </v>

1827
01:24:02.951 --> 01:24:03.784
<v Speaker 4>getting the ball all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They thought like they had no idea that </v>

1828
01:24:07.691 --> 01:24:09.220
<v Speaker 4>they weren't on the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

1829
01:24:09.221 --> 01:24:11.120
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got passed through all the time.</v>

1830
01:24:11.150 --> 01:24:12.860
<v Speaker 4>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He loves money,</v>

1831
01:24:12.861 --> 01:24:13.040
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They</v>

1832
01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.230
<v Speaker 2>just will love and other people catching</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ball.</v>

1833
01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:16.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1834
01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.830
<v Speaker 2>so happy for you man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You caught it.</v>

1835
01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:19.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you through it.</v>

1836
01:24:19.341 --> 01:24:22.320
<v Speaker 2>He got an a I'm happy for you too dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1837
01:24:22.321 --> 01:24:25.700
<v Speaker 2>That an interesting Mtma can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely beneficial to anybody.</v>

1838
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:29.810
<v Speaker 2>At least one trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just found the only trip that I did,</v>

1839
01:24:29.811 --> 01:24:30.381
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1840
01:24:30.381 --> 01:24:32.570
<v Speaker 2>this is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can learn something from this.</v>

1841
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1842
01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:37.070
<v Speaker 2>like a Mescalin which comes in both what</v>
<v Speaker 2>tumor,</v>

1843
01:24:37.071 --> 01:24:42.071
<v Speaker 2>the San Pedro Cactus and pay ot is also </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Sarah to nudge it kind of psychedelic.</v>

1844
01:24:42.201 --> 01:24:45.410
<v Speaker 2>So if you haven't had a lot more to MDM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar.</v>

1845
01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:46.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1846
01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.130
<v Speaker 2>MDM may is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1847
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:52.610
<v Speaker 2>like a more pharmaceutical approach to </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevating serotonin in that feeling that</v>

1848
01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:55.100
<v Speaker 2>this associated with selling Serotonin </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your body,</v>

1849
01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:59.450
<v Speaker 2>whereas the masculine drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics do that in a similar way,</v>

1850
01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.940
<v Speaker 2>but with the little bit more of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>visionary component.</v>

1851
01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:02.930
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1852
01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:04.140
<v Speaker 2>but both have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1853
01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:08.720
<v Speaker 2>once one is just a more direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>application and I think that's great for</v>

1854
01:25:08.721 --> 01:25:09.554
<v Speaker 2>a situation like maps is testing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>ptsd and certain other kinds of </v>

1855
01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:14.720
<v Speaker 2>situations because it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproducible.</v>

1856
01:25:14.721 --> 01:25:18.380
<v Speaker 2>It's very like clinical reaction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen in the brain.</v>

1857
01:25:18.710 --> 01:25:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Whereas something with like what Chuma </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you this overwhelming experience,</v>

1858
01:25:22.971 --> 01:25:25.880
<v Speaker 2>but it's woven in with all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other different things.</v>

1859
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:27.103
<v Speaker 2>The problem really holy resides in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that these drugs are illegal </v>

1860
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:31.940
<v Speaker 2>because if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they weren't illegal we would look at</v>

1861
01:25:31.941 --> 01:25:32.301
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1862
01:25:32.301 --> 01:25:33.134
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this might be solutions for people </v>

1863
01:25:33.981 --> 01:25:37.040
<v Speaker 2>suffering from Ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from this,</v>

1864
01:25:37.041 --> 01:25:39.680
<v Speaker 2>from that social anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social anxiety.</v>

1865
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:40.783
<v Speaker 2>And also kind of gives you your brain a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance to almost detached like a lens </v>

1866
01:25:45.831 --> 01:25:46.664
<v Speaker 2>that detaches from the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a look at the inner workings of the </v>

1867
01:25:49.011 --> 01:25:50.550
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then before you put it back on,</v>

1868
01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:52.100
<v Speaker 2>you kind of get a better understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

1869
01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:53.193
<v Speaker 2>And so I guess there's a detachment that</v>
<v Speaker 2>MDA has like from some of the nonsense </v>

1870
01:25:57.861 --> 01:26:00.860
<v Speaker 2>you've carried around with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like clothes that you know,</v>

1871
01:26:00.861 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 2>you've just worn it your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't realize bullshit until you</v>

1872
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.010
<v Speaker 5>take something that makes you feel like </v>
<v Speaker 5>this is all so ridiculous.</v>

1873
01:26:07.011 --> 01:26:07.844
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1874
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:08.550
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1875
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:09.361
<v Speaker 4>what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1876
01:26:09.361 --> 01:26:10.194
<v Speaker 4>talking to the psychologist and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychiatrist of why it's so beneficial </v>

1877
01:26:12.721 --> 01:26:13.554
<v Speaker 4>is we all carry a lot of trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all carry these things from our past </v>

1878
01:26:16.410 --> 01:26:17.243
<v Speaker 4>that are the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that was another thing I </v>

1879
01:26:19.290 --> 01:26:21.090
<v Speaker 4>keep talking about the Jordan Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast,</v>

1880
01:26:21.091 --> 01:26:23.070
<v Speaker 4>but he talked about that self authoring </v>
<v Speaker 4>program,</v>

1881
01:26:23.071 --> 01:26:25.080
<v Speaker 4>which is rewriting these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1882
01:26:25.081 --> 01:26:26.580
<v Speaker 4>he was talking about actually writing </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1883
01:26:26.910 --> 01:26:31.910
<v Speaker 4>but what MDM is doing for people with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ptsd and with anybody is it's going back</v>

1884
01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:32.993
<v Speaker 4>and looking at all of these traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 4>things in our history and our past and </v>

1885
01:26:36.181 --> 01:26:39.240
<v Speaker 4>which is also one of the things that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the studies that they're showing,</v>

1886
01:26:39.241 --> 01:26:40.074
<v Speaker 4>they have a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychiatrist who's guiding people back </v>

1887
01:26:42.781 --> 01:26:46.290
<v Speaker 4>to these potential traumatic events.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you're flooded with Serotonin,</v>

1888
01:26:46.291 --> 01:26:48.210
<v Speaker 4>you see things in a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>

1889
01:26:48.211 --> 01:26:52.380
<v Speaker 4>You see things from the vantage vantage </v>
<v Speaker 4>point of love and it's all good.</v>

1890
01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:53.453
<v Speaker 4>So no matter what situation came about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll see that kind of higher </v>

1891
01:26:56.761 --> 01:26:58.770
<v Speaker 4>perspective rather than that fear </v>
<v Speaker 4>response,</v>

1892
01:26:58.771 --> 01:27:02.370
<v Speaker 4>that kind of cringing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that creates more fear and more trauma.</v>

1893
01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:05.190
<v Speaker 4>You look at it and you're able to relax,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see it and say,</v>

1894
01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:06.720
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was pretty horrible,</v>

1895
01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:08.310
<v Speaker 4>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's okay.</v>

1896
01:27:08.311 --> 01:27:10.530
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm still okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still have these bright things.</v>

1897
01:27:10.531 --> 01:27:12.490
<v Speaker 4>And you repattern the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1898
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:16.470
<v Speaker 4>you repattern that traumatic experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you go to draw that back up from</v>

1899
01:27:16.471 --> 01:27:17.304
<v Speaker 4>your past,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're drawing up a different </v>

1900
01:27:18.661 --> 01:27:19.494
<v Speaker 4>recategorize experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're rewriting the software </v>

1901
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:23.460
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1902
01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:26.340
<v Speaker 4>always rewriteable like those </v>
<v Speaker 4>rewriteable floppy disks.</v>

1903
01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:27.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you take that thing out,</v>

1904
01:27:27.811 --> 01:27:28.644
<v Speaker 4>you rewrite it with a whole different </v>
<v Speaker 4>hue of your neurochemicals in the </v>

1905
01:27:31.591 --> 01:27:34.830
<v Speaker 4>feelings that you surrounding it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when you access it again,</v>

1906
01:27:34.831 --> 01:27:36.750
<v Speaker 4>or when it's just carrying around in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1907
01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:41.010
<v Speaker 4>in your memory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it doesn't have the same sting.</v>

1908
01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:41.873
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have the same trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the mechanisms of </v>

1909
01:27:44.131 --> 01:27:44.964
<v Speaker 4>action of of MDA and also what they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at with Iowasca Iowasca going </v>

1910
01:27:49.111 --> 01:27:49.944
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not flooding you necessarily with </v>

1911
01:27:51.181 --> 01:27:52.014
<v Speaker 4>Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but showing you that if these events in </v>

1912
01:27:54.001 --> 01:27:56.460
<v Speaker 4>a slightly different perspective showing</v>
<v Speaker 4>you well,</v>

1913
01:27:56.461 --> 01:27:57.294
<v Speaker 4>hey that's actually what made you so </v>
<v Speaker 4>ambitious and so strong and this </v>

1914
01:28:00.151 --> 01:28:01.820
<v Speaker 4>traumatic thing that you thought was so </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible,</v>

1915
01:28:01.821 --> 01:28:04.710
<v Speaker 4>it actually brought out all of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>other benefits and it was actually,</v>

1916
01:28:05.010 --> 01:28:05.843
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you really see from the person who </v>

1917
01:28:07.230 --> 01:28:09.030
<v Speaker 4>the perpetrators perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1918
01:28:09.031 --> 01:28:12.180
<v Speaker 4>look at all the sadness that created </v>
<v Speaker 4>that look at where he was coming from so</v>

1919
01:28:12.181 --> 01:28:16.260
<v Speaker 4>you repattern that traumatic event and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's not carrying that sign,</v>

1920
01:28:16.261 --> 01:28:18.720
<v Speaker 4>the same dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible weight,</v>

1921
01:28:19.050 --> 01:28:21.780
<v Speaker 4>that lifeless body that you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>carry around.</v>

1922
01:28:21.781 --> 01:28:22.680
<v Speaker 4>It's just been rewritten.</v>

1923
01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:28.140
<v Speaker 5>There's also the perspective that who </v>
<v Speaker 5>you are like as a person right now is an</v>

1924
01:28:28.241 --> 01:28:30.670
<v Speaker 5>accumulative effect of all your </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences.</v>

1925
01:28:30.671 --> 01:28:32.260
<v Speaker 5>That's what makes you who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1926
01:28:32.261 --> 01:28:35.020
<v Speaker 5>if you have some mind blowing </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience,</v>

1927
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:38.680
<v Speaker 5>which is what the psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences you are going to change,</v>

1928
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:40.390
<v Speaker 5>like you're going to be a different </v>
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

1929
01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:41.313
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might be a,</v>

1930
01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:42.573
<v Speaker 5>a microscopic shifted the dial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you had a safe and you are </v>

1931
01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:45.851
<v Speaker 5>clicking click,</v>
<v Speaker 5>click,</v>

1932
01:28:45.851 --> 01:28:46.684
<v Speaker 5>click.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be like one click click like </v>

1933
01:28:47.951 --> 01:28:48.784
<v Speaker 5>after a psychedelic experience and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you might have another psychedelic </v>

1934
01:28:50.441 --> 01:28:52.030
<v Speaker 5>explains.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might get a double click,</v>

1935
01:28:52.031 --> 01:28:52.720
<v Speaker 5>click,</v>
<v Speaker 5>click,</v>

1936
01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's very small movements,</v>

1937
01:28:54.431 --> 01:28:55.264
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But ultimately you're a different </v>

1938
01:28:57.341 --> 01:28:59.950
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if even if it's a small movement,</v>

1939
01:29:00.250 --> 01:29:01.083
<v Speaker 5>that new experience has given you a </v>
<v Speaker 5>chance to sort of mock the things that </v>

1940
01:29:04.561 --> 01:29:07.860
<v Speaker 5>were threatening you just momentarily,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just as just a few moments ago,</v>

1941
01:29:07.861 --> 01:29:10.320
<v Speaker 5>just four hours ago before he took the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms,</v>

1942
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:11.071
<v Speaker 5>he like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

1943
01:29:11.071 --> 01:29:11.904
<v Speaker 5>why was I worried about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's nothing like it gives you that </v>

1944
01:29:13.741 --> 01:29:16.950
<v Speaker 5>opportunity because you're literally a </v>
<v Speaker 5>different person now.</v>

1945
01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:20.100
<v Speaker 5>You've had this experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fucking problem is they're illegal.</v>

1946
01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:21.023
<v Speaker 5>If they weren't illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd be able to eat because it has the </v>

1947
01:29:22.711 --> 01:29:23.491
<v Speaker 5>big fear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1948
01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:24.840
<v Speaker 5>How do I know what I'm taking?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>

1949
01:29:24.841 --> 01:29:27.270
<v Speaker 5>how do you know what you're taking?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't fucking know.</v>

1950
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:28.223
<v Speaker 5>You don't know because big Daddy Pharma </v>
<v Speaker 5>has paid off the fucking big daddy </v>

1951
01:29:31.981 --> 01:29:35.940
<v Speaker 5>government to keep it out of your greasy</v>
<v Speaker 5>little hands so you can't trip balls and</v>

1952
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:37.680
<v Speaker 5>live in the woods like a fucking Pixie.</v>

1953
01:29:39.130 --> 01:29:41.680
<v Speaker 4>The beautiful thing is though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's common cause I think the open,</v>

1954
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:44.380
<v Speaker 4>as soon as they opened the doors to </v>
<v Speaker 4>clinical research,</v>

1955
01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:48.640
<v Speaker 4>it's an undeniable force.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you cannot deny the evidence that's</v>

1956
01:29:48.641 --> 01:29:51.460
<v Speaker 4>coming back from the maps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know phase two clinical trials.</v>

1957
01:29:51.610 --> 01:29:52.443
<v Speaker 4>You cannot deny the evidence coming out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of Johns Hopkins and these are the </v>

1958
01:29:55.451 --> 01:29:56.284
<v Speaker 4>research institutes about psilocybin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are helping people with conditions </v>

1959
01:29:59.681 --> 01:30:01.050
<v Speaker 4>and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1960
01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.133
<v Speaker 4>follow the scientific method all the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>through and all the plants are going to </v>

1961
01:30:04.391 --> 01:30:06.160
<v Speaker 4>arrive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we're going to get them all home.</v>

1962
01:30:06.250 --> 01:30:08.790
<v Speaker 4>We've got to get trump on drugs for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1963
01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:08.980
<v Speaker 4>We've</v>

1964
01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:12.630
<v Speaker 5>got to get the new president to do DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we got him to do DMT,</v>

1965
01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:16.440
<v Speaker 5>it would change so much or just just a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little dose of mushrooms,</v>

1966
01:30:16.441 --> 01:30:18.120
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't even have to get crazy.</v>

1967
01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:18.983
<v Speaker 5>Take a gram and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a gram and a half or a little </v>

1968
01:30:20.371 --> 01:30:21.700
<v Speaker 5>reset.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just a little reset,</v>

1969
01:30:21.701 --> 01:30:23.130
<v Speaker 5>just a little little sit back and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little,</v>

1970
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:24.040
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1971
01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.830
<v Speaker 5>What are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are we doing here?</v>

1972
01:30:25.831 --> 01:30:27.900
<v Speaker 5>Exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are we doing here?</v>

1973
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:29.333
<v Speaker 5>I just think this is a unique and </v>
<v Speaker 5>special time and as long as we can be </v>

1974
01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:37.100
<v Speaker 5>aware and as long as we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1975
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:39.690
<v Speaker 5>we verbalize that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We say it all the time.</v>

1976
01:30:39.691 --> 01:30:40.524
<v Speaker 5>This is a unique and special time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's capitalize on this unique and </v>

1977
01:30:43.141 --> 01:30:43.974
<v Speaker 5>special time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's use this unique and special time </v>

1978
01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:51.530
<v Speaker 5>to establish a new understanding for </v>
<v Speaker 5>this generation and to set things up way</v>

1979
01:30:52.261 --> 01:30:53.550
<v Speaker 5>better for the next generation.</v>

1980
01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:54.840
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my parents,</v>

1981
01:30:54.841 --> 01:30:55.674
<v Speaker 5>I'm older than you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My parents were essentially raised by </v>

1982
01:30:58.351 --> 01:31:02.160
<v Speaker 5>barbarians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They came over on a fucking boat.</v>

1983
01:31:02.161 --> 01:31:04.830
<v Speaker 5>They had no idea what was over here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know their,</v>

1984
01:31:04.831 --> 01:31:07.590
<v Speaker 5>their parents did it really like my </v>
<v Speaker 5>grandparents parents did it.</v>

1985
01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:10.620
<v Speaker 5>That came over from Italy and from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ireland.</v>

1986
01:31:10.650 --> 01:31:12.120
<v Speaker 5>They were savages,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1987
01:31:12.210 --> 01:31:13.043
<v Speaker 5>They were hardly different from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that came over on the boats </v>

1988
01:31:14.851 --> 01:31:17.400
<v Speaker 5>during the pilgrim days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were barbarians.</v>

1989
01:31:17.610 --> 01:31:20.070
<v Speaker 5>They just had a little bit more culture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little bit more language,</v>

1990
01:31:20.071 --> 01:31:20.904
<v Speaker 5>a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This.</v>

1991
01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:23.610
<v Speaker 5>They beat the shit out of their wives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were always drunk.</v>

1992
01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:25.110
<v Speaker 5>There are monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of them,</v>

1993
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:27.500
<v Speaker 5>they're just crazy people scratching and</v>
<v Speaker 5>clawing.</v>

1994
01:31:28.410 --> 01:31:30.930
<v Speaker 5>Their understanding of life during the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ed Sullivan show,</v>

1995
01:31:31.290 --> 01:31:33.510
<v Speaker 5>their understanding of what the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>was really all about.</v>

1996
01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:34.373
<v Speaker 5>It's so far removed from the average 20 </v>
<v Speaker 5>year old with a an internet account who </v>

1997
01:31:38.851 --> 01:31:41.430
<v Speaker 5>can go on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as he stays away from those flat</v>

1998
01:31:41.431 --> 01:31:42.264
<v Speaker 5>earth videos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's going to have a real good </v>

1999
01:31:43.561 --> 01:31:44.394
<v Speaker 5>understanding of how this mother fucker </v>
<v Speaker 5>works and a way better understanding </v>

2000
01:31:46.811 --> 01:31:51.811
<v Speaker 5>than any grown adult with children did </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the 1950s when my parents were kids.</v>

2001
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:54.390
<v Speaker 5>There's no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no,</v>

2002
01:31:54.391 --> 01:31:55.224
<v Speaker 5>you can't compete.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think that we have this unique </v>

2003
01:31:57.991 --> 01:32:00.030
<v Speaker 5>opportunity to set up the future</v>

2004
01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:03.880
<v Speaker 2>society where all of this silliness that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we still have to deal with.</v>

2005
01:32:03.881 --> 01:32:04.714
<v Speaker 2>Like the wiki leaks email that came out </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Hillary Clinton has said that she </v>

2006
01:32:06.851 --> 01:32:10.930
<v Speaker 2>opposes marijuana quote in every sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the word.</v>

2007
01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:14.800
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that anymore.</v>

2008
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:15.663
<v Speaker 2>Like that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people were still willing to </v>

2009
01:32:16.961 --> 01:32:18.250
<v Speaker 2>support that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this,</v>

2010
01:32:18.370 --> 01:32:20.320
<v Speaker 2>oh this is better than him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He grabs pussies.</v>

2011
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you sure it's better?</v>

2012
01:32:22.690 --> 01:32:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Cause I don't know if it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the whole thing's a mess.</v>

2013
01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:29.230
<v Speaker 2>You can't have people stopping pinebrook</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2014
01:32:29.231 --> 01:32:30.064
<v Speaker 2>it's all both the part with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all about freedom and anybody that </v>

2015
01:32:33.371 --> 01:32:35.530
<v Speaker 2>wants to stop pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can stop sex,</v>

2016
01:32:35.531 --> 01:32:36.364
<v Speaker 2>they can stop whatever the fuck you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that they decide they can profit </v>

2017
01:32:39.251 --> 01:32:40.084
<v Speaker 2>off of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You not doing that and you think they </v>

2018
01:32:41.081 --> 01:32:43.300
<v Speaker 2>can't stop sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look what religion did to sex.</v>

2019
01:32:43.330 --> 01:32:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2020
01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Look how many people were burned for </v>
<v Speaker 2>their sexual practices at the stake.</v>

2021
01:32:47.831 --> 01:32:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Literally like you can ban absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2022
01:32:51.011 --> 01:32:51.844
<v Speaker 2>There's laws on the books that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing people in jail for </v>

2023
01:32:53.771 --> 01:32:54.604
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality that will flare up still </v>
<v Speaker 2>now like a k in different places of the </v>

2024
01:32:58.961 --> 01:32:59.794
<v Speaker 2>world where they'll kill people for sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that that hasn't even been </v>

2025
01:33:02.621 --> 01:33:03.900
<v Speaker 2>tried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

2026
01:33:03.930 --> 01:33:04.763
<v Speaker 2>the ability of the monstrous nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans to be able to impose those </v>

2027
01:33:08.651 --> 01:33:11.260
<v Speaker 2>restrictions on people of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sovereignty of their own consciousness.</v>

2028
01:33:11.261 --> 01:33:13.990
<v Speaker 2>And their own body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can only ejaculate this way.</v>

2029
01:33:13.991 --> 01:33:17.200
<v Speaker 2>You can only expand your consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>in these manners.</v>

2030
01:33:17.201 --> 01:33:18.034
<v Speaker 2>Like women can't drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to dress like genies have to </v>

2031
01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:21.920
<v Speaker 2>cover themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genie.</v>

2032
01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:26.180
<v Speaker 2>That's so wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2033
01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:29.710
<v Speaker 2>it's like we got to discard all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and it's idea that you know,</v>

2034
01:33:29.711 --> 01:33:30.544
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these pastors have more knowledge than </v>

2035
01:33:32.351 --> 01:33:33.950
<v Speaker 2>someone who just spent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2036
01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:36.670
<v Speaker 2>a few days out in the woods doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>

2037
01:33:36.670 --> 01:33:37.503
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you sure you know the other ones </v>

2038
01:33:39.610 --> 01:33:41.500
<v Speaker 2>photo from heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a lock.</v>

2039
01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:42.250

<v Speaker 2>he's at all,</v>

2041
01:33:44.290 --> 01:33:45.123
<v Speaker 2>there was a story that was out just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of days ago about some woman in </v>

2042
01:33:47.231 --> 01:33:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Indonesia that received a hundred lashes</v>
<v Speaker 2>for like being around a man,</v>

2043
01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:52.084
<v Speaker 2>being too close to a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of people that were </v>

2044
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:57.600
<v Speaker 2>publicly flogged for sex crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were sex crimes as similar,</v>

2045
01:33:57.610 --> 01:33:58.301
<v Speaker 2>like as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

2046
01:33:58.301 --> 01:34:01.270
<v Speaker 2>as innocuous as a woman was too close to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man.</v>

2047
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Like they gave her like 90 lashes or </v>
<v Speaker 2>some crazy shit.</v>

01:34:13.451 --> 01:34:14.284
<v Speaker 2>So he got a hundred lashes and there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one about a woman that dude </v>

2052
01:34:16.031 --> 01:34:16.864

<v Speaker 2>fucking sex bdsm dungeon porn from San </v>

2053
01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:22.953
<v Speaker 2>Francisco where they took that old </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison out and they all fucking dress </v>

2054
01:34:24.711 --> 01:34:26.110
<v Speaker 2>like that and locking people up.</v>

2055
01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:29.140
<v Speaker 2>It's the same dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just gets to do it in public.</v>

2056
01:34:29.141 --> 01:34:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's even extra kinky.</v>

2057
01:34:30.551 --> 01:34:34.900

<v Speaker 2>She was flogged with a rat and candy.</v>

2058
01:34:34.901 --> 01:34:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Say Rattan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd he say it?</v>

2059
01:34:36.221 --> 01:34:37.120

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2060
01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:42.310
<v Speaker 2>At least seven times for being too close</v>
<v Speaker 2>in close proximity to a man.</v>

2061
01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:47.140
<v Speaker 2>So they beat her with a cane seven times</v>
<v Speaker 2>for being in close proximity to a man.</v>

2062
01:34:47.410 --> 01:34:51.190
<v Speaker 2>That 32 year old male who was with her </v>
<v Speaker 2>was also flogged seven times.</v>

2063
01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:52.653
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

2064
01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.270

<v Speaker 2>structured.</v>

01:34:55.271 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 2>The 34 old one was flogged with a Kane </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least seven</v>

2066
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.260
<v Speaker 1>times being in close proximity to a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the Har.</v>

2067
01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:01.333
<v Speaker 1>The 32 year old male who was with her </v>
<v Speaker 1>was also flagged seven times like </v>

2068
01:35:03.711 --> 01:35:06.110
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the man and the woman were both</v>

2069
01:35:06.111 --> 01:35:10.520
<v Speaker 1>flag flog seven times each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the woman horror upon horrors.</v>

2070
01:35:10.521 --> 01:35:11.354
<v Speaker 1>This beautiful young woman was flogged </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she had sex with a man or </v>

2071
01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:17.000
<v Speaker 1>because she was close to a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dude was flogged too,</v>

2072
01:35:17.001 --> 01:35:18.950
<v Speaker 1>but fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2073
01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:21.110
<v Speaker 1>and the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hurts so bad.</v>

2074
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:22.183
<v Speaker 1>The woman said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she cited AFP raising her arms in the </v>

2075
01:35:25.341 --> 01:35:26.360
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the dude?</v>

2076
01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:29.090
<v Speaker 1>The dude didn't even ask him that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even ask the dude.</v>

2077
01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:29.921
<v Speaker 1>Fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2078
01:35:29.921 --> 01:35:30.754
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking CIS gendered asshole with </v>

2079
01:35:32.991 --> 01:35:37.340
<v Speaker 1>his male privilege is white mates </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably white in Indonesia.</v>

2080
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:39.320
<v Speaker 1>They probably would have given them a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred if he was black.</v>

2081
01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:42.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2082
01:35:42.370 --> 01:35:44.910
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to the dungeon of the inquisition</v>

2083
01:35:44.911 --> 01:35:45.744
<v Speaker 4>in Italy and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that changed my whole perspective on </v>

2084
01:35:48.031 --> 01:35:48.670
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

2085
01:35:48.670 --> 01:35:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Put that back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do this one,</v>

2086
01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:52.900
<v Speaker 1>but we'll go back to where you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

2087
01:35:52.930 --> 01:35:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2088
01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:54.493
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2089
01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:55.673
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie doesn't know how to do the </v>

2090
01:35:57.161 --> 01:35:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2091
01:35:59.861 --> 01:36:00.694
<v Speaker 1>The a man found guilty of sex outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the marriage was also flogged at least </v>

2092
01:36:04.091 --> 01:36:04.924
<v Speaker 1>22 times by the person delivering the </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment who is dressed in long robes </v>

2093
01:36:09.731 --> 01:36:10.564
<v Speaker 1>and a hood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His partner who was two months pregnant </v>

2094
01:36:12.821 --> 01:36:15.340
<v Speaker 1>is still waiting for her fate to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided,</v>

2095
01:36:15.610 --> 01:36:16.443
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's pregnant and they're going to </v>

2096
01:36:17.771 --> 01:36:20.860
<v Speaker 1>decide her fate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2097
01:36:20.861 --> 01:36:21.694
<v Speaker 1>In such situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>officials in the province usually order </v>

2098
01:36:23.891 --> 01:36:26.500
<v Speaker 1>the flogging of the woman after they </v>
<v Speaker 1>give birth.</v>

2099
01:36:26.770 --> 01:36:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

2100
01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:35.920
<v Speaker 1>That's Indonesia 2016 that is holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>

2101
01:36:36.730 --> 01:36:40.510
<v Speaker 1>That is just what happens when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide what the rules are.</v>

2102
01:36:40.511 --> 01:36:43.390
<v Speaker 1>You can't let people decide the rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

2103
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:46.500
<v Speaker 4>and Lou and have false metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 4>underpinnings,</v>

2104
01:36:46.501 --> 01:36:49.560
<v Speaker 4>have that underpinning that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's someone who deserves that kind of</v>

2105
01:36:49.561 --> 01:36:50.640
<v Speaker 4>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2106
01:36:50.641 --> 01:36:51.960
<v Speaker 4>have that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2107
01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:54.540
<v Speaker 4>you lose the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's fundamental things.</v>

2108
01:36:54.630 --> 01:36:57.930
<v Speaker 4>That's me living a different life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I want to do that to me like do you</v>

2109
01:36:57.931 --> 01:36:58.764
<v Speaker 4>understand the actual truth of the urges</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that person had and the truth of </v>

2110
01:37:02.071 --> 01:37:03.990
<v Speaker 4>everything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You start turning everything on its head</v>

2111
01:37:03.991 --> 01:37:06.630
<v Speaker 4>and then you get these crazy rules and </v>
<v Speaker 4>abilities like,</v>

2112
01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:07.553
<v Speaker 4>and it's not just Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I went to the dungeon of the </v>

2113
01:37:09.181 --> 01:37:13.200
<v Speaker 4>inquisition in Italy and it was so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking darker than a cane.</v>

2114
01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:15.350
<v Speaker 4>She may feel it when you're in the room </v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

2115
01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:16.373
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was nauseatingly especially when you </v>

2116
01:37:17.971 --> 01:37:21.360
<v Speaker 4>start seeing that 60% of these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>things have to do with your genitals,</v>

2117
01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:22.553
<v Speaker 4>like burning rods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're shoving and Dick Holes and </v>

2118
01:37:24.961 --> 01:37:26.840
<v Speaker 4>assholes and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's all for Jesus the way.</v>

2119
01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:27.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2120
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.823
<v Speaker 4>For Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the absolute antithesis of the </v>

2121
01:37:32.251 --> 01:37:34.200
<v Speaker 4>Jesus message when you really look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2122
01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:37.050
<v Speaker 4>Mystically but like if like from the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the what,</v>

2123
01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:37.884
<v Speaker 4>the metaphysical truths of what he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>espousing and then somehow they go from </v>

2124
01:37:40.801 --> 01:37:42.480
<v Speaker 4>that to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's,</v>

2125
01:37:42.481 --> 01:37:44.820
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like that incremental creep,</v>

2126
01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:45.893
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>towards a little bit harsher </v>

2127
01:37:46.561 --> 01:37:48.960
<v Speaker 4>punishments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit more sadistic,</v>

2128
01:37:48.961 --> 01:37:49.794
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you get more and more and more and </v>

2129
01:37:51.691 --> 01:37:54.420
<v Speaker 4>you get that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start feeding that urge for sadism,</v>

2130
01:37:54.421 --> 01:37:56.610
<v Speaker 4>that urge to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to not only,</v>

2131
01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:59.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>punish somebody but to do it in the most</v>

2132
01:37:59.101 --> 01:38:00.610
<v Speaker 4>horrifying way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2133
01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:02.190
<v Speaker 4>that's part of human nature.</v>

2134
01:38:02.290 --> 01:38:04.110
<v Speaker 5>We know about the Stanford prison </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiments,</v>

2135
01:38:04.111 --> 01:38:04.471
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2136
01:38:04.471 --> 01:38:05.290
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2137
01:38:05.290 --> 01:38:07.860
<v Speaker 5>If you haven't heard about that folks </v>
<v Speaker 5>look it up.</v>

2138
01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:09.990
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really interesting story.</v>

2139
01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:10.950
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2140
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:14.460
<v Speaker 5>they had these students and these </v>
<v Speaker 5>college students at Stanford,</v>

2141
01:38:14.461 --> 01:38:15.294
<v Speaker 5>they put them through this experiment </v>
<v Speaker 5>where some of them were guards and some </v>

2142
01:38:18.481 --> 01:38:19.314
<v Speaker 5>of them were prisoners and the guards </v>
<v Speaker 5>almost immediately started abusing the </v>

2143
01:38:22.411 --> 01:38:25.650
<v Speaker 5>prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They fucking cancel it.</v>

2144
01:38:25.890 --> 01:38:27.680
<v Speaker 5>They had to cancel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just stop it short.</v>

2145
01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:29.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

2146
01:38:29.650 --> 01:38:31.180
<v Speaker 4>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2147
01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:33.380
<v Speaker 4>the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that we all try to,</v>

2148
01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:35.540
<v Speaker 4>we all try to bury these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these thoughts,</v>

2149
01:38:35.541 --> 01:38:37.370
<v Speaker 4>these darker thoughts that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2150
01:38:37.371 --> 01:38:39.460
<v Speaker 4>like all of us inside of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2151
01:38:39.461 --> 01:38:43.070
<v Speaker 4>you look at times of war and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole armies that would go,</v>

2152
01:38:43.071 --> 01:38:45.590
<v Speaker 4>part of why they would go on these </v>
<v Speaker 4>contracts was for rape.</v>

2153
01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:46.873
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we all think of ourselves like as </v>

2154
01:38:48.511 --> 01:38:50.090
<v Speaker 4>as men now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like man,</v>

2155
01:38:50.091 --> 01:38:53.360
<v Speaker 4>I would never be capable of of doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything hurting anybody else.</v>

2156
01:38:53.361 --> 01:38:54.194
<v Speaker 4>But inside our genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inside the things that was passed along </v>

2157
01:38:56.271 --> 01:38:57.104
<v Speaker 4>our lineage where warrior cultures that </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably produced are fucking ancestors </v>

2158
01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:04.340
<v Speaker 4>through rape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's part of every individual,</v>

2159
01:39:04.341 --> 01:39:05.410
<v Speaker 4>these dark thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

2160
01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:08.270
<v Speaker 4>it feels somehow good to hurt somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

2161
01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.730
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that we deny those </v>
<v Speaker 4>entirely,</v>

2162
01:39:10.731 --> 01:39:12.440
<v Speaker 4>they become monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2163
01:39:12.441 --> 01:39:15.530
<v Speaker 4>is where if you just acknowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like look at them and say,</v>

2164
01:39:15.531 --> 01:39:16.970
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm all the bad stuff,</v>

2165
01:39:16.971 --> 01:39:19.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm all the good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all good.</v>

2166
01:39:19.041 --> 01:39:20.720
<v Speaker 4>What am I going to choose to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2167
01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:25.190
<v Speaker 4>what do I want to put out in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's a really important,</v>

2168
01:39:25.191 --> 01:39:27.860
<v Speaker 4>important facet to recognize that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2169
01:39:27.861 --> 01:39:29.570
<v Speaker 4>we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all fucked up,</v>

2170
01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:32.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's our choice to decides,</v>

2171
01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:33.133
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who we really are and what we want to </v>

2172
01:39:33.921 --> 01:39:34.754
<v Speaker 4>bring into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are we going to make this amazing video </v>

2173
01:39:36.741 --> 01:39:38.600
<v Speaker 4>game a better place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a better game?</v>

2174
01:39:38.610 --> 01:39:40.910
<v Speaker 4>Are we going to make it miserable for </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody?</v>

2175
01:39:40.911 --> 01:39:41.720
<v Speaker 4>We encountered,</v>

2176
01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.090
<v Speaker 5>I've always wondered about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2177
01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:44.053
<v Speaker 5>mob rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I've always wanted about the mob </v>

2178
01:39:46.281 --> 01:39:48.110
<v Speaker 5>mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is that?</v>

2179
01:39:48.170 --> 01:39:49.560
<v Speaker 5>Where's that coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that coming?</v>

2180
01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.640
<v Speaker 5>Is that like an acceptance of war?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like is that,</v>

2181
01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:53.533
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if that's some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>survival mechanism when you able to do </v>

2182
01:39:56.241 --> 01:39:58.430
<v Speaker 5>horrific shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as long as everybody around you is doing</v>

2183
01:39:58.431 --> 01:40:00.470
<v Speaker 5>horrific shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all a sudden the,</v>

2184
01:40:00.471 --> 01:40:01.304
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the collective mindset shifts and new </v>

2185
01:40:03.591 --> 01:40:06.080
<v Speaker 5>rules apply.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if people are coming over the fence</v>

2186
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:08.270
<v Speaker 5>and y'all have axes and you're coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of them,</v>

2187
01:40:08.271 --> 01:40:10.430
<v Speaker 5>you're doing things you would never do </v>
<v Speaker 5>on a daily basis.</v>

2188
01:40:10.431 --> 01:40:12.740
<v Speaker 5>You're hacking off arms and attacking </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

2189
01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:14.030
<v Speaker 5>And once it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's real.</v>

2190
01:40:14.031 --> 01:40:15.620
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once the first guy gets an Arrow through</v>

2191
01:40:15.621 --> 01:40:17.870
<v Speaker 5>the fucking head and you see the shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>going down,</v>

2192
01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:18.973
<v Speaker 5>like you're swinging and it's all going </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy and everyone around you is doing </v>

2193
01:40:21.051 --> 01:40:22.880
<v Speaker 5>the same thing and no one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one could go,</v>

2194
01:40:22.881 --> 01:40:23.810
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>

2195
01:40:24.170 --> 01:40:25.380
<v Speaker 5>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2196
01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:26.233
<v Speaker 5>what are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's let's stop here and let's realize </v>

2197
01:40:28.401 --> 01:40:29.234
<v Speaker 5>we could all get along.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's plenty of vegetables for </v>

2198
01:40:30.261 --> 01:40:31.094
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's stop the rape and get to know </v>

2199
01:40:32.421 --> 01:40:35.840
<v Speaker 5>these girls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'd cut your fucking head off and let</v>

2200
01:40:35.841 --> 01:40:38.540
<v Speaker 5>your house on fire and stab your mom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would go crazy.</v>

2201
01:40:38.541 --> 01:40:39.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2202
01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.170
<v Speaker 5>blood lust.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is something,</v>

2203
01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:44.420
<v Speaker 5>a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because there's a,</v>

2204
01:40:44.421 --> 01:40:45.254
<v Speaker 5>something that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a thing that happens to people </v>

2205
01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:49.190
<v Speaker 5>when you have that mob mentality,</v>

2206
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:50.103
<v Speaker 4>you could probably look at like Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone like Steven Kotler can probably </v>

2207
01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 4>you more about the,</v>

2208
01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:57.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the adrenaline in neurochemical response</v>

2209
01:40:57.101 --> 01:41:00.170
<v Speaker 2>that's creating this version of yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sucks,</v>

2210
01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:02.830
<v Speaker 2>supercharged and these certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your empathy,</v>

2211
01:41:02.970 --> 01:41:04.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your empathy ratings go way down.</v>

2212
01:41:04.991 --> 01:41:07.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>westworld control board,</v>

2213
01:41:07.751 --> 01:41:09.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like empathy ratings,</v>

2214
01:41:09.461 --> 01:41:10.294
<v Speaker 2>way down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression way up like all of these </v>

2215
01:41:12.371 --> 01:41:14.560
<v Speaker 2>different neurochemicals that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing,</v>

2216
01:41:14.561 --> 01:41:15.394
<v Speaker 2>like literally changing yourself into </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that is much more favorable </v>

2217
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:20.950
<v Speaker 2>for those actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2218
01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:23.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it creates a collective mindset.</v>

2219
01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:25.053
<v Speaker 5>The individual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's one of the things you hear </v>

2220
01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:30.070
<v Speaker 5>all the time about war is the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the really noble,</v>

2221
01:41:30.071 --> 01:41:33.940
<v Speaker 5>heroic warriors who sacrifice themselves</v>
<v Speaker 5>to save others.</v>

2222
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.903
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the main themes that we love</v>
<v Speaker 5>hearing about like the guy who dives on </v>

2223
01:41:38.831 --> 01:41:41.650
<v Speaker 5>the grenade to save his people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to save the guys who are around him.</v>

2224
01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:44.680
<v Speaker 5>Like that is something that happens in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that crazy,</v>

2225
01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:49.300
<v Speaker 5>that crazy environment of that intensity</v>
<v Speaker 5>of life.</v>

2226
01:41:49.570 --> 01:41:50.403
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the weirdest things about a </v>
<v Speaker 5>man is how many people who go through </v>

2227
01:41:52.571 --> 01:41:56.050
<v Speaker 5>that say it was the best time of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>life and they'd love to go back.</v>

2228
01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:57.243
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2229
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:58.051
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>presence,</v>

2230
01:41:58.051 --> 01:41:58.884
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think that anytime your </v>

2231
01:41:59.911 --> 01:42:01.920
<v Speaker 2>presence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you're present,</v>

2232
01:42:02.150 --> 01:42:04.410
<v Speaker 2>you're some of the best time in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2233
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Not like Christmas present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2234
01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:07.320
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're just present,</v>

2235
01:42:07.321 --> 01:42:08.154
<v Speaker 2>like when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in flow state when you're in war </v>

2236
01:42:09.901 --> 01:42:12.000
<v Speaker 2>because part of it is that intense </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat,</v>

2237
01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:12.893
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you don't have time to think about </v>

2238
01:42:14.251 --> 01:42:16.160
<v Speaker 2>your email that incessant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2239
01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:19.500
<v Speaker 2>voice from your phone to check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instagram is not in your fucking head.</v>

2240
01:42:19.530 --> 01:42:20.760
<v Speaker 2>You're more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2241
01:42:20.761 --> 01:42:21.870
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it lends,</v>

2242
01:42:21.871 --> 01:42:25.180
<v Speaker 2>some girl's been like dm and and Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go on down,</v>

2243
01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:27.253
<v Speaker 2>we'll meeting up tonight for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think probably at a certain level </v>

2244
01:42:30.571 --> 01:42:31.404
<v Speaker 2>of like Tim Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might have those thoughts like it's </v>

2245
01:42:33.061 --> 01:42:36.630
<v Speaker 2>just so called for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't fuck well the Musashi thing.</v>

2246
01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2247
01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:38.273
<v Speaker 2>That's probably why you actually started</v>
<v Speaker 2>having to fight with oars because at a </v>

2248
01:42:40.291 --> 01:42:43.410
<v Speaker 2>certain point with a sword,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably wasn't even getting the same</v>

2249
01:42:43.411 --> 01:42:44.340
<v Speaker 2>feeling anymore.</v>

2250
01:42:44.370 --> 01:42:45.203
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably didn't even feel like a sword </v>

2251
01:42:46.201 --> 01:42:47.100
<v Speaker 2>battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a,</v>

2252
01:42:47.310 --> 01:42:48.143
<v Speaker 2>like a sparring match when you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going 20% and you're all relaxed </v>

2253
01:42:50.971 --> 01:42:53.760
<v Speaker 2>and shit rather than when you're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing like,</v>

2254
01:42:53.761 --> 01:42:55.110
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are coming for me.</v>

2255
01:42:55.111 --> 01:42:58.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a different kind of mental state </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you get in.</v>

2256
01:42:58.021 --> 01:42:59.030
<v Speaker 2>And maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2257
01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:00.210
<v Speaker 2>the or thing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

2258
01:43:00.211 --> 01:43:01.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not feeling it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm too good.</v>

2259
01:43:01.710 --> 01:43:02.543
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually realized to that or had a </v>

2260
01:43:04.021 --> 01:43:07.320
<v Speaker 2>much longer reach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who's cracking dudes in the head from</v>

2261
01:43:07.321 --> 01:43:08.154
<v Speaker 2>the outside?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was actually a good strategic </v>

2262
01:43:10.891 --> 01:43:12.180
<v Speaker 2>element to the or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

2263
01:43:12.181 --> 01:43:14.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure he whittled the or down </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

2264
01:43:14.971 --> 01:43:18.370
<v Speaker 2>and he would show up super late and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said to James,</v>

2265
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:20.570
<v Speaker 2>just be so tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be just freak.</v>

2266
01:43:20.571 --> 01:43:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I gonna die tonight?</v>

2267
01:43:22.130 --> 01:43:24.510
<v Speaker 2>They'd be thinking of that for hours and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then finally shows up.</v>

2268
01:43:24.650 --> 01:43:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But back then mean,</v>

2269
01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:28.590
<v Speaker 2>what do they had fucking Sun dials on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrists.</v>

2270
01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:31.200
<v Speaker 2>How'd you even know what time it was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could definitely get away with a lot</v>

2271
01:43:31.201 --> 01:43:33.660
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of wiggle room for fucking</v>

2272
01:43:33.661 --> 01:43:35.610
<v Speaker 2>dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's done to you bro?</v>

2273
01:43:36.330 --> 01:43:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Midday to midday is a real fucking day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're supposed to meet Jesus high noon.</v>

2274
01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:44.400
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that even mean?</v>

2275
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're around a Sundial.</v>

2276
01:43:47.730 --> 01:43:49.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even that seems like it'd be hard to</v>

2277
01:43:49.771 --> 01:43:51.280
<v Speaker 2>get that right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had that on rest.</v>

2278
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:52.123
<v Speaker 2>I was only the flintstones.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like five minutes fast.</v>

2471
01:52:24.730 --> 01:52:27.130

2472
01:52:27.131 --> 01:52:28.960

<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2483
01:52:47.241 --> 01:52:48.074
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quartz movement is just going to be </v>

2484
01:52:48.531 --> 01:52:49.790
<v Speaker 1>more accurate than this.</v>

01:53:50.121 --> 01:53:52.550
<v Speaker 4>I think when you really don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2508
01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:53.810
<v Speaker 4>going back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know the self,</v>

2509
01:53:53.811 --> 01:53:57.530
<v Speaker 4>you want to feel better by your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about yourself by making yourself better</v>

2510
01:53:57.531 --> 01:54:00.380
<v Speaker 4>than somebody else because you have no </v>
<v Speaker 4>other reference point of what it is.</v>

2511
01:54:00.381 --> 01:54:01.161
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

2512
01:54:01.161 --> 01:54:03.590
<v Speaker 4>if I'm better than these other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2513
01:54:03.591 --> 01:54:04.424
<v Speaker 4>whether it's something you have or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something you are inherently are the </v>

2514
01:54:06.771 --> 01:54:09.470
<v Speaker 4>Melanin in your skin or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you want to say.</v>

2515
01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:11.420
<v Speaker 4>If that makes you better than someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>else,</v>

2516
01:54:11.421 --> 01:54:14.540
<v Speaker 4>then you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can feel better about yourself.</v>

2517
01:54:14.541 --> 01:54:15.650
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who I am.</v>

2518
01:54:15.651 --> 01:54:16.484
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I'm good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least I'm better than these </v>

2519
01:54:18.021 --> 01:54:19.030
<v Speaker 4>fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2520
01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:21.500
<v Speaker 4>And then that makes you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's all,</v>

2521
01:54:21.501 --> 01:54:24.590
<v Speaker 4>it's all this fucking bullshit game that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we try to tell ourselves.</v>

2522
01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:25.424
<v Speaker 4>It comes from the fundamental lack of </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing who we are and knowing that </v>

2523
01:54:28.461 --> 01:54:30.980
<v Speaker 4>whoever we are is enough and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

2524
01:54:30.981 --> 01:54:31.814
<v Speaker 4>And we're all the same.</v>

2525
01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:33.930
<v Speaker 1>You say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Boris,</v>

2526
01:54:33.931 --> 01:54:35.870
<v Speaker 1>the guy with that fucking transformer on</v>
<v Speaker 1>his rest,</v>

2527
01:54:35.871 --> 01:54:36.704
<v Speaker 1>he was getting his dick sucked right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>while drinking vodka flying his private </v>

2528
01:54:39.151 --> 01:54:41.610
<v Speaker 1>jet over the Atlantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He disagrees with you.</v>

2529
01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:43.613
<v Speaker 1>That girl knows that that's a $250 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million watch or whatever the fuck he's </v>

2530
01:54:47.071 --> 01:54:47.904
<v Speaker 1>wearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knows he's bawling adequate control </v>

2531
01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:54.090
<v Speaker 1>on his private jet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's covered with feathers.</v>

2532
01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Boris got his whole jet decked out like </v>
<v Speaker 1>an eagle.</v>

2533
01:55:03.330 --> 01:55:08.330
<v Speaker 1>The wings actually flat somehow makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the flying worse that they flat just for</v>

2534
01:55:09.421 --> 01:55:12.490
<v Speaker 1>effect and that's when he starts coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2535
01:55:12.750 --> 01:55:16.680
<v Speaker 1>when the eagle wings flap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while he's looking at his watch,</v>

2536
01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:21.060
<v Speaker 1>oh he looks at his watch at the girl and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then out the window in that order,</v>

2537
01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:25.850
<v Speaker 1>the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best moment of his life.</v>

2538
01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:26.753
<v Speaker 1>And then he shoots himself in the head </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he knows it will never be any </v>

2539
01:55:28.441 --> 01:55:29.274
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

2540
01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:30.713
<v Speaker 1>Everything has been building to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoots a couple holes in the plane so </v>

2541
01:55:33.451 --> 01:55:35.830
<v Speaker 1>that it fucking crashes and then shoots </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

2542
01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:37.793
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Eagle Wings would clearly bring the </v>

2543
01:55:39.301 --> 01:55:40.134
<v Speaker 1>plane down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually the minute you activated Eagle </v>

2544
01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that plane is fucking taken.</v>

2545
01:55:44.891 --> 01:55:47.700
<v Speaker 1>It taken a nose dive and a captain </v>
<v Speaker 1>solely.</v>

2546
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:49.650
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever gone out on top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2547
01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:52.080
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever had like the ultimate life</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2548
01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:52.973
<v Speaker 1>And then you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it doesn't get any better than </v>

2549
01:55:54.631 --> 01:55:55.620

<v Speaker 5>up to one 85.</v>

2621
01:59:07.191 --> 01:59:11.060
<v Speaker 5>He's just so much better than it was at </v>
<v Speaker 5>one 70 and Derek Brunson just came after</v>

2622
01:59:11.061 --> 01:59:11.894
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Derek bronze is the same guy who he had </v>

2623
01:59:13.341 --> 01:59:15.140
<v Speaker 5>just knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2624
01:59:15.380 --> 01:59:18.230
<v Speaker 5>uriah hall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He caught him with a beautiful left hook</v>

2625
01:59:18.231 --> 01:59:20.690
<v Speaker 5>and heard them and it was just crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>

2626
01:59:21.290 --> 01:59:22.123
<v Speaker 5>And then he came back from that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>employ the same strategy against </v>

2627
01:59:24.711 --> 01:59:25.521
<v Speaker 5>whitaker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what did your,</v>

2628
01:59:25.521 --> 01:59:27.080
<v Speaker 5>kept it together?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kept together?</v>

2629
01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:28.310
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he ate a lot of shots,</v>

2630
01:59:28.311 --> 01:59:29.210
<v Speaker 5>kept moving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2631
01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:30.133
<v Speaker 5>kept his hands up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kept his composure and then finally </v>

2632
01:59:31.791 --> 01:59:33.680
<v Speaker 5>found an opening him boom.</v>

2633
01:59:34.010 --> 01:59:34.843
<v Speaker 5>Dropped one on Brunson and then had </v>
<v Speaker 5>Brunson crazy hurt and then moved in on </v>

2634
01:59:37.461 --> 01:59:38.960
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was an awesome,</v>

2635
01:59:39.410 --> 01:59:40.243
<v Speaker 5>it was an awesome exhibition for Wediko </v>
<v Speaker 5>show that whitaker could overcome the </v>

2636
01:59:43.281 --> 01:59:44.114
<v Speaker 5>storm of like a super confident and </v>
<v Speaker 5>really dangerous guy who hits fucking </v>

2637
01:59:47.571 --> 01:59:49.790
<v Speaker 5>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's had a lot of confidence because of</v>

2638
01:59:49.791 --> 01:59:52.400
<v Speaker 5>his most recent success doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2639
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:54.680
<v Speaker 5>Bronson came after him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

2640
01:59:54.681 --> 01:59:56.390
<v Speaker 5>really came after him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Super aggressive,</v>

2641
01:59:56.420 --> 02:00:00.350
<v Speaker 5>maybe too aggressive for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now in hindsight you could say that,</v>

2642
02:00:00.351 --> 02:00:03.770
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of people other than whitaker </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably would a wilted to that storm.</v>

2643
02:00:03.870 --> 02:00:04.703
<v Speaker 5>So it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a really stern test for whitaker </v>

2644
02:00:06.981 --> 02:00:09.500
<v Speaker 5>and showed you how strong he is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2645
02:00:09.650 --> 02:00:12.110
<v Speaker 4>It was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the beautiful aspects of watching</v>

2646
02:00:12.111 --> 02:00:12.944
<v Speaker 4>these different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this chess play out with the whole body </v>

2647
02:00:14.991 --> 02:00:16.520
<v Speaker 4>being utilized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2648
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:18.650
<v Speaker 4>you're never going to beat it for its </v>
<v Speaker 4>excitement level.</v>

2649
02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:19.420
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2650
02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:20.570
<v Speaker 4>You have to realize</v>

2651
02:00:20.670 --> 02:00:22.680
<v Speaker 5>while you're watching it that liked </v>
<v Speaker 5>life,</v>

2652
02:00:23.010 --> 02:00:25.260
<v Speaker 5>nobody gets out for free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2653
02:00:25.290 --> 02:00:26.160
<v Speaker 5>Like life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2654
02:00:26.161 --> 02:00:31.161
<v Speaker 5>it's almost a microcosm of life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy struggle and it,</v>

2655
02:00:32.370 --> 02:00:33.203
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't always end your way is this </v>

2656
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:35.743
<v Speaker 5>is what competition is in mixed martial </v>
<v Speaker 5>arts is the most extreme version of </v>

2657
02:00:40.081 --> 02:00:41.970
<v Speaker 5>problem solving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have outside of war,</v>

2658
02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:45.690
<v Speaker 5>some most extreme with dire physical </v>
<v Speaker 5>consequences.</v>

2659
02:00:45.691 --> 02:00:48.450
<v Speaker 5>You get brains like we saw Pat Barry get</v>
<v Speaker 5>k out there,</v>

2660
02:00:48.630 --> 02:00:50.640
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the consequences of this game.</v>

2661
02:00:51.090 --> 02:00:51.923
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2662
02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:54.560
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reality or the,</v>

2663
02:00:54.570 --> 02:00:55.403
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the take is nobody gets out anyway </v>

2664
02:00:57.751 --> 02:00:58.584
<v Speaker 5>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2665
02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:01.470
<v Speaker 5>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you choose to experience this,</v>

2666
02:01:01.471 --> 02:01:03.750
<v Speaker 5>this extremely high level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very short bursts,</v>

2667
02:01:03.770 --> 02:01:06.360
<v Speaker 5>understand how much resources you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>burning off,</v>

2668
02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:09.280
<v Speaker 5>understand what you're doing and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2669
02:01:09.330 --> 02:01:10.163
<v Speaker 5>proceed wisely.</v>

2670
02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:10.980
<v Speaker 4>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2671
02:01:10.980 --> 02:01:12.490
<v Speaker 4>when I talked to fighters who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2672
02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:14.130
<v Speaker 4>sometimes question like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2673
02:01:14.131 --> 02:01:16.290
<v Speaker 4>what am I doing it myself?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just beating people up.</v>

2674
02:01:16.291 --> 02:01:17.970
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2675
02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:19.073
<v Speaker 4>to remind like remind them that what </v>
<v Speaker 4>really is happening is two people are </v>

2676
02:01:22.711 --> 02:01:26.580
<v Speaker 4>coming to an agreement to provide a form</v>
<v Speaker 4>of resistance for each other.</v>

2677
02:01:26.610 --> 02:01:27.443
<v Speaker 4>Like at the highest level of what this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is like you're going to come face to </v>

2678
02:01:30.781 --> 02:01:31.614
<v Speaker 4>face with someone who's also training </v>
<v Speaker 4>and also striving to do everything that </v>

2679
02:01:34.711 --> 02:01:35.544
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what's going to push you up </v>

2680
02:01:37.201 --> 02:01:39.860
<v Speaker 4>against that form of resistance and give</v>
<v Speaker 4>an opportunity</v>

2681
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:43.220
<v Speaker 2>not only to overcome physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but overcome emotionally,</v>

2682
02:01:43.221 --> 02:01:44.300
<v Speaker 2>spiritually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychically,</v>

2683
02:01:44.301 --> 02:01:45.540
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2684
02:01:45.541 --> 02:01:48.710
<v Speaker 2>you'll have to bring everything to bear </v>
<v Speaker 2>against that form of resistance,</v>

2685
02:01:48.711 --> 02:01:52.220
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the weight cut or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opponent or the training or everything.</v>

2686
02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:54.220
<v Speaker 2>And there's something to be said for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2687
02:01:54.700 --> 02:01:55.533
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously the only issue for a lot of </v>

2688
02:01:57.351 --> 02:01:59.960
<v Speaker 2>people is that you end up paying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>price,</v>

2689
02:02:00.170 --> 02:02:02.990
<v Speaker 2>not only then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but later if you get the brain damage,</v>

2690
02:02:02.991 --> 02:02:03.824
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

2691
02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:05.930
<v Speaker 2>that's the only bummer of it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that,</v>

2692
02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:07.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be considered,</v>

2693
02:02:07.371 --> 02:02:11.210
<v Speaker 2>but as if it wasn't for that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a fucking beautiful way to do it.</v>

2694
02:02:11.211 --> 02:02:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Like to get everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything all together,</v>

2695
02:02:14.931 --> 02:02:17.960
<v Speaker 2>unified in one and provide that ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 2>form of resistance.</v>

2696
02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:19.273
<v Speaker 2>It's like unbeatable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was definitely the most difficult </v>

2697
02:02:21.261 --> 02:02:23.750
<v Speaker 2>physical challenge that we know of </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're competing,</v>

2698
02:02:23.810 --> 02:02:24.643
<v Speaker 2>especially at the highest level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're competing with someone who's the </v>

2699
02:02:26.721 --> 02:02:31.721
<v Speaker 2>same size as you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a commensurate level of expertise as</v>

2700
02:02:31.881 --> 02:02:35.390
<v Speaker 2>you and is as motivated as you are to </v>
<v Speaker 2>win,</v>

2701
02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:37.573
<v Speaker 2>and you're in this crazy competition </v>
<v Speaker 2>together where you're literally playing </v>

2702
02:02:40.731 --> 02:02:44.660
<v Speaker 2>a game of press the button and then who </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know who's who can shut off,</v>

2703
02:02:44.661 --> 02:02:46.280
<v Speaker 2>who's central nervous system quicker.</v>

2704
02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:52.030
<v Speaker 2>What I'm fucking crazy game you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2705
02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:55.820
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to duplicate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>excitement of that with any other sport.</v>

2706
02:02:56.150 --> 02:02:58.340
<v Speaker 2>You come close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I guess football is probably pretty</v>

2707
02:02:58.341 --> 02:02:59.174
<v Speaker 2>close for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boxing's probably a right up there in </v>

2708
02:03:02.151 --> 02:03:03.290
<v Speaker 2>moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2709
02:03:03.291 --> 02:03:05.990
<v Speaker 2>like when one men wall Ma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me say that again.</v>

2710
02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:09.080
<v Speaker 2>One man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well Marquez knocked out Pacquiao.</v>

2711
02:03:09.230 --> 02:03:10.063
<v Speaker 2>He hit him with that beautiful clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight punch and just flat and </v>

2712
02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Pacquiao.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was about as dramatic a moment that</v>

2713
02:03:15.071 --> 02:03:18.470
<v Speaker 2>you get in any sort of combat sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see a superhero like pack.</v>

2714
02:03:18.471 --> 02:03:20.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get leveled with one shot.</v>

2715
02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:21.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2716
02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:22.273
<v Speaker 2>but that woe is just so much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevalent and mixed martial arts that </v>

2717
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:29.150
<v Speaker 2>whoa happens so much more often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different thing.</v>

2718
02:03:29.210 --> 02:03:32.000
<v Speaker 2>And I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more rules that you put in,</v>

2719
02:03:32.090 --> 02:03:32.923
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of that kind of primal </v>

2720
02:03:34.611 --> 02:03:35.720
<v Speaker 2>conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2721
02:03:35.721 --> 02:03:37.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little bit more,</v>

2722
02:03:37.890 --> 02:03:39.180
<v Speaker 2>it kind of separates it.</v>

2723
02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:40.340
<v Speaker 2>It makes it a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2724
02:03:40.341 --> 02:03:41.174
<v Speaker 2>like when you see boxers kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbing each other and doing nothing </v>

2725
02:03:43.551 --> 02:03:44.750
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2726
02:03:44.751 --> 02:03:46.640
<v Speaker 2>that's when that moment of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

2727
02:03:46.641 --> 02:03:47.720
<v Speaker 2>this is a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2728
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:50.450
<v Speaker 2>Whereas in MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's fewer of those moments where you</v>

2729
02:03:50.451 --> 02:03:51.650
<v Speaker 2>go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

2730
02:03:51.651 --> 02:03:52.484
<v Speaker 2>this is a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really just feels like people </v>

2731
02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:55.890
<v Speaker 2>fighting to the death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2732
02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:58.280
<v Speaker 2>They're the only moments where you go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports.</v>

2733
02:03:58.281 --> 02:03:59.570
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't grab the fence,</v>

2734
02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:02.240
<v Speaker 2>or I am punched the balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Oh,</v>

2735
02:04:02.241 --> 02:04:04.030
<v Speaker 2>he pumped it high timeout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2736
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:06.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's moments in boxing where you go,</v>

2737
02:04:06.771 --> 02:04:07.880
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of silly.</v>

2738
02:04:08.150 --> 02:04:09.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come you can just hang on like this?</v>

2739
02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:11.750
<v Speaker 2>How come that guy can't trip you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>take you down?</v>

2740
02:04:11.751 --> 02:04:13.690
<v Speaker 2>How come he can't kick your legs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2741
02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:14.533
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard for me to watch boxing </v>

2742
02:04:15.891 --> 02:04:19.070
<v Speaker 2>sometimes and not think about kicking </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's legs like,</v>

2743
02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:20.750
<v Speaker 2>or someone kicking someone's legs </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather.</v>

2744
02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Not that I'm running around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2745
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm see the way they're standing and I'm</v>

2746
02:04:25.701 --> 02:04:25.971
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2747
02:04:25.971 --> 02:04:28.850
<v Speaker 2>well there's those little thoughts like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is effective.</v>

2748
02:04:29.570 --> 02:04:31.100
<v Speaker 2>As long as someone's not kicking your </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs.</v>

2749
02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:31.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know.</v>

2750
02:04:31.641 --> 02:04:33.860
<v Speaker 2>But if you're fighting the same fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

2751
02:04:33.861 --> 02:04:34.694
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fighting someone like Joe </v>

2752
02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:37.033
<v Speaker 2>Schilling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be fucking kicking the </v>

2753
02:04:37.441 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 2>shit out of your</v>

2754
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:38.820
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2755
02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:39.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a totally different experience and </v>

2756
02:04:40.471 --> 02:04:41.304
<v Speaker 1>he's a long dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's going to be standing way on the </v>

2757
02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:45.030
<v Speaker 1>outside and if you don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with that,</v>

2758
02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:48.420
<v Speaker 1>you're only going to be able to absorb a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few of those before you're useless.</v>

2759
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:49.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you think of like Badr Hari's like </v>

2760
02:04:50.671 --> 02:04:52.650
<v Speaker 1>leaping overhand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2761
02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:53.533
<v Speaker 1>Where he commits everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of his childhood pain and to that </v>

2762
02:04:56.670 --> 02:04:57.510
<v Speaker 1>right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2763
02:04:57.780 --> 02:04:58.613
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And mma because someone would just duck </v>

2764
02:05:01.381 --> 02:05:04.860
<v Speaker 1>underneath it in double leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's never had to worry about that.</v>

2765
02:05:04.861 --> 02:05:06.540
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still still,</v>

2766
02:05:06.541 --> 02:05:07.374
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the most exciting </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers ever and he's fighting </v>

2767
02:05:08.611 --> 02:05:11.090
<v Speaker 1>against soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting Rico Verhoeven going to be</v>

2783
02:05:45.781 --> 02:05:46.614
<v Speaker 1>he just commits commencing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely violent way and sometimes he </v>

2784
02:05:49.921 --> 02:05:51.330
<v Speaker 1>gets carried out on the shield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

02:08:30.910 --> 02:08:32.710
<v Speaker 1>like that Barbosa kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2851
02:08:33.230 --> 02:08:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Well that was almost a different one </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

2852
02:08:35.141 --> 02:08:36.940
<v Speaker 1>that he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A side kick to the face.</v>

2853
02:08:37.450 --> 02:08:39.850
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't do it as like a wheel kick.</v>

2854
02:08:39.851 --> 02:08:42.040
<v Speaker 1>If you watch it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rewind a little bit.</v>

2855
02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:44.770
<v Speaker 1>He shot it as a straight kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rewind it.</v>

2856
02:08:45.900 --> 02:08:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2857
02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:49.660
<v Speaker 1>he threw it as if you see how he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing it there.</v>

2858
02:08:49.660 --> 02:08:50.493
<v Speaker 1>He threw it to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a spinning sidekick or turning </v>

2859
02:08:52.571 --> 02:08:55.390
<v Speaker 1>sidekick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not doing it as a back kick.</v>

2860
02:08:55.391 --> 02:08:57.670
<v Speaker 1>If you did the toes to be down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but see how he went up there.</v>

2861
02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:00.280
<v Speaker 1>That was just a turning side kick to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

2862
02:09:00.730 --> 02:09:01.563
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of halfway between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both halfway between a wheel kick and a </v>

2863
02:09:04.031 --> 02:09:05.950
<v Speaker 1>spinning back kick or a turning </v>
<v Speaker 1>sidekick.</v>

2864
02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:08.200
<v Speaker 1>But it was fucking beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

2865
02:09:08.850 --> 02:09:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Look smaller wheel kick when I look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it there.</v>

2866
02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>But Jesus Christ the perfect Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right on the blocks and Stefan Leco uh,</v>

2867
02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:19.570
<v Speaker 1>who was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a great fight or two man.</v>

2868
02:09:19.571 --> 02:09:20.404
<v Speaker 1>That guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2869
02:09:20.410 --> 02:09:21.243
<v Speaker 1>he knocked a lot of dudes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw him knock out Peter Earths in Vegas </v>

2870
02:09:24.130 --> 02:09:27.580
<v Speaker 1>One k one was just starting to come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were do it putting on some shows in</v>

2871
02:09:27.581 --> 02:09:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Vegas this before the UFC was big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought that k one was,</v>

2872
02:09:31.210 --> 02:09:35.050
<v Speaker 1>would I think really still think it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have if it was promoted properly,</v>

2873
02:09:35.230 --> 02:09:37.150
<v Speaker 1>could have like gotten a grip in North </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

2874
02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2875
02:09:39.550 --> 02:09:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Gloria is pushing that boulder now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gloria is a good example.</v>

2876
02:09:42.791 --> 02:09:46.300
<v Speaker 1>And so as lion fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I prefer the rules of lion fight though.</v>

2877
02:09:46.630 --> 02:09:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Cause lion fight is full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moitai yeah,</v>

2878
02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:49.773
<v Speaker 1>elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to one of those [inaudible] </v>

2879
02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:51.611
<v Speaker 1>Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2880
02:09:51.611 --> 02:09:53.650
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the few things that I go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see live.</v>

2881
02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:55.700
<v Speaker 1>I still like to go see live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2882
02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A high level Moitai in America.</v>

2883
02:09:59.170 --> 02:10:03.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like the level of the fights is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very high.</v>

2884
02:10:03.250 --> 02:10:05.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just people aren't just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't totally not aware of it yet.</v>

2885
02:10:06.970 --> 02:10:09.790
<v Speaker 1>They need to be though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy exciting.</v>

2886
02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:12.760
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's so much talent.</v>

2887
02:10:12.970 --> 02:10:16.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not like this is an exciting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only like five guys are good at it.</v>

2888
02:10:16.630 --> 02:10:19.030
<v Speaker 1>It's an exciting thing where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the lighter weights,</v>

2889
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:22.690
<v Speaker 1>like Thailand's full of fucking killers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got a ton of them in Europe.</v>

2890
02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:23.553
<v Speaker 1>They've got them all over the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many good Moy Thai fighters </v>

2891
02:10:26.291 --> 02:10:27.100
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

2892
02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:29.980
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't caught on yet.</v>

2893
02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:32.200
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think when I think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this time,</v>

2894
02:10:32.201 --> 02:10:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the best time ever because</v>

2895
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:36.920
<v Speaker 4>we get to see all of these incredible </v>
<v Speaker 4>contest,</v>

2896
02:10:36.921 --> 02:10:37.754
<v Speaker 4>still extremely physical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're still at the rising peak of </v>

2897
02:10:40.611 --> 02:10:41.444
<v Speaker 4>our physical prowess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're also at the peak of our </v>

2898
02:10:43.581 --> 02:10:44.414
<v Speaker 4>technological prowess and the peak of </v>
<v Speaker 4>our ability to access all of the best </v>

2899
02:10:47.901 --> 02:10:48.734
<v Speaker 4>foods and access the best ideas and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the different things that can shape </v>

2900
02:10:52.611 --> 02:10:57.611
<v Speaker 4>us like as pessimistic as people get it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is for sure the best of times right now.</v>

2901
02:10:58.071 --> 02:11:00.110
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the majority of people now obviously</v>

2902
02:11:00.111 --> 02:11:03.290
<v Speaker 4>they're hell's on the planet still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's hell's that we can put ourselves</v>

2903
02:11:03.291 --> 02:11:04.580
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's suffering,</v>

2904
02:11:04.581 --> 02:11:07.970
<v Speaker 4>but overall on the macro level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking,</v>

2905
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:09.750
<v Speaker 4>it's the golden age now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2906
02:11:10.070 --> 02:11:11.660
<v Speaker 4>Anybody argues with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an asshole.</v>

2907
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:12.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2908
02:11:12.771 --> 02:11:13.604
<v Speaker 4>I want to go back to a time where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>had to speak with grunt and even in the </v>

2909
02:11:16.011 --> 02:11:18.680
<v Speaker 4>future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I can't imagine that the,</v>

2910
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:24.260
<v Speaker 4>I guess maybe maybe it would like maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've just seen too many gray aliens,</v>

2911
02:11:24.261 --> 02:11:25.094
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the body kind of becomes less and </v>

2912
02:11:26.271 --> 02:11:29.240
<v Speaker 4>less important and everything is focused</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the consciousness.</v>

2913
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:33.020
<v Speaker 4>I feel like you get to that level and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you fucking miss this,</v>

2914
02:11:33.110 --> 02:11:34.730
<v Speaker 4>this certain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2915
02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:39.440
<v Speaker 4>evolution and epoch for the pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 4>monkey where we had all of that physical</v>

2916
02:11:39.441 --> 02:11:44.270
<v Speaker 4>access to strive and train and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and feel all the physical things as well</v>

2917
02:11:44.271 --> 02:11:45.140
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2918
02:11:45.141 --> 02:11:45.974
<v Speaker 4>reach incredible heights in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in consciousness and meditation and you </v>

2919
02:11:49.251 --> 02:11:51.080
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>community and these,</v>

2920
02:11:51.310 --> 02:11:52.400
<v Speaker 4>these great things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

2921
02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:53.713
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think really no matter what stage </v>

2922
02:11:55.641 --> 02:11:58.070
<v Speaker 4>before or after,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we'll look back at this one.</v>

2923
02:11:58.071 --> 02:12:00.080
<v Speaker 4>Like this was a special fucking time.</v>

2924
02:12:00.290 --> 02:12:01.123
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a special time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think every time it's a special </v>

2925
02:12:03.051 --> 02:12:03.884
<v Speaker 1>time because every time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter where you are and the </v>

2926
02:12:05.690 --> 02:12:07.490
<v Speaker 1>timescale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in that moment,</v>

2927
02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:08.353
<v Speaker 1>you're in the most present time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the most current time and I </v>

2928
02:12:11.211 --> 02:12:12.044
<v Speaker 1>guarantee you at every step of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were logging with nostalgia for </v>

2929
02:12:15.411 --> 02:12:16.580
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet they were like,</v>

2930
02:12:16.581 --> 02:12:17.414
<v Speaker 1>God damn man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who used to rape is run across the </v>

2931
02:12:19.701 --> 02:12:21.500
<v Speaker 1>village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chop heads off and shit.</v>

2932
02:12:21.540 --> 02:12:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Good old days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

2933
02:12:22.710 --> 02:12:23.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good times before they started writing </v>

2934
02:12:24.231 --> 02:12:25.064
<v Speaker 1>things down on paper is probably a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people that miss that they miss to </v>

2935
02:12:30.301 --> 02:12:31.134
<v Speaker 1>shooting arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just launched them in the air and </v>

2936
02:12:32.571 --> 02:12:34.130
<v Speaker 1>whatever's over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck them.</v>

2937
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:38.420
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made it rain arrows from the sky</v>

2938
02:12:38.530 --> 02:12:42.790
<v Speaker 4>and like 50 years after that was over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some viking king had a slogan,</v>

2939
02:12:42.791 --> 02:12:43.680
<v Speaker 4>let Denmark race</v>

2940
02:12:43.810 --> 02:12:45.800
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was excited.</v>

2941
02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Not Denmark rape again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We let the killings begin a new,</v>

2942
02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:53.910
<v Speaker 1>but that was a big problem with Japan's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he didn't want to embrace the gun was</v>

2943
02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:54.261
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2944
02:12:54.261 --> 02:12:57.080
<v Speaker 1>you pussies can't be fucking shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>people with guns.</v>

2945
02:12:57.260 --> 02:13:00.050
<v Speaker 1>That's such a bitch ass way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to use solar.</v>

2946
02:13:00.051 --> 02:13:01.640
<v Speaker 1>It's come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

2947
02:13:01.641 --> 02:13:03.560
<v Speaker 1>don't be a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

2948
02:13:03.590 --> 02:13:05.270
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've held on too long.</v>

2949
02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:08.120
<v Speaker 1>They didn't embrace the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to get on that right away.</v>

2950
02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:11.170
<v Speaker 1>If they had the Japanese engineering </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you see today in Lexus,</v>

2951
02:13:11.370 --> 02:13:13.850
<v Speaker 1>if they had applied that to guns back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day,</v>

2952
02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:16.920
<v Speaker 1>had same knowhow and discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the best gun stayed,</v>

2953
02:13:16.921 --> 02:13:17.560
<v Speaker 1>not the best gun,</v>

2954
02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:18.393
<v Speaker 4>but you dedicate yourself and become </v>
<v Speaker 4>masters in the world at swordsmanship </v>

2955
02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:22.950
<v Speaker 4>and then the gun comes along,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2956
02:13:23.290 --> 02:13:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

2957
02:13:25.391 --> 02:13:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This trumps all of my years of work.</v>

2958
02:13:29.350 --> 02:13:30.480
<v Speaker 1>But the sword.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2959
02:13:30.900 --> 02:13:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made it easy.</v>

2960
02:13:32.370 --> 02:13:33.203
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of like a supermarket did for </v>

2961
02:13:35.490 --> 02:13:40.230
<v Speaker 5>versus being a substance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a living off the land type person.</v>

2962
02:13:40.630 --> 02:13:41.463
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you've watched those shows from a </v>

2963
02:13:42.750 --> 02:13:43.583
<v Speaker 5>Alaska where the people are all living </v>
<v Speaker 5>in and grow their own vegetables and </v>

2964
02:13:45.991 --> 02:13:49.620
<v Speaker 5>shit and they catch fish in the river,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something romantic about it.</v>

2965
02:13:49.621 --> 02:13:51.840
<v Speaker 5>Write something that drags.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love those shows,</v>

2966
02:13:51.841 --> 02:13:52.680
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I watch those shows.</v>

2967
02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:54.273
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you like,</v>

2968
02:13:54.380 --> 02:13:55.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your purpose every day.</v>

2969
02:13:55.881 --> 02:13:57.350
<v Speaker 4>And I think when people know their </v>
<v Speaker 4>purpose,</v>

2970
02:13:57.351 --> 02:13:59.330
<v Speaker 4>my purpose is to survive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get food,</v>

2971
02:13:59.331 --> 02:14:00.650
<v Speaker 4>stay warm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2972
02:14:01.030 --> 02:14:02.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make babies.</v>

2973
02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:04.940
<v Speaker 4>Like it's really comforting to know what</v>
<v Speaker 4>your purpose is.</v>

2974
02:14:05.170 --> 02:14:05.631
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2975
02:14:05.631 --> 02:14:06.464
<v Speaker 4>And especially if you don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 4>internet like before they got on </v>

2976
02:14:08.181 --> 02:14:09.014
<v Speaker 4>television,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how much access to Internet </v>

2977
02:14:10.070 --> 02:14:10.940
<v Speaker 4>even had up there.</v>

2978
02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:12.053
<v Speaker 5>Ma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why watch this one family that </v>

2979
02:14:12.821 --> 02:14:14.590
<v Speaker 5>apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that uh,</v>

2980
02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:17.380
<v Speaker 5>that singer jewel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you know who she is?</v>

2981
02:14:17.590 --> 02:14:18.423
<v Speaker 5>She has a one snaggletooth but she's </v>
<v Speaker 5>very beautiful and people like the fact </v>

2982
02:14:21.041 --> 02:14:23.950
<v Speaker 5>that she doesn't fix her teeth because </v>
<v Speaker 5>she's imperfect yet.</v>

2983
02:14:23.951 --> 02:14:25.040
<v Speaker 5>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2984
02:14:25.150 --> 02:14:29.050
<v Speaker 5>she's apparently from this one family </v>
<v Speaker 5>that has this,</v>

2985
02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:32.470
<v Speaker 5>this show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>goddammit Alaska,</v>

2986
02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:34.990
<v Speaker 5>the final frontier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that the name of it?</v>

2987
02:14:35.410 --> 02:14:36.250
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but anyway,</v>

2988
02:14:36.251 --> 02:14:37.950
<v Speaker 5>it's her relatives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2989
02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:40.900
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like close relatives that live up</v>

2990
02:14:40.901 --> 02:14:44.890
<v Speaker 5>there in this crazy way and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2991
02:14:44.891 --> 02:14:49.891
<v Speaker 5>real simple like some of them farm and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they raised cattle and they have to like</v>

2992
02:14:50.170 --> 02:14:51.003
<v Speaker 5>move their cattle across this area to </v>
<v Speaker 5>take them to where they graze and they </v>

2993
02:14:54.911 --> 02:14:55.744
<v Speaker 5>drop them off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they have to move them back at the </v>

2994
02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:58.630
<v Speaker 5>end of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's nuts.</v>

2995
02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:00.310
<v Speaker 5>And so while they're up there doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2996
02:15:00.820 --> 02:15:03.490
<v Speaker 5>grizzly bears just start ripping their </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking cows apart.</v>

2997
02:15:03.490 --> 02:15:05.650
<v Speaker 5>So now they have to go and deal with </v>
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

2998
02:15:05.890 --> 02:15:06.723
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>11 foot tall giant dog things that need </v>

2999
02:15:11.291 --> 02:15:12.124
<v Speaker 5>food constantly to consume.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And on one hand you can't blame them </v>

3000
02:15:14.650 --> 02:15:18.160
<v Speaker 5>like these fat stupid cows just </v>
<v Speaker 5>wandering around over by the grass.</v>

3001
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:21.310
<v Speaker 5>All they have to do is go by the grass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's fucking hundreds of them.</v>

3002
02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:24.580
<v Speaker 5>Where else are they going to find </v>
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of things that they can eat?</v>

3003
02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:25.683
<v Speaker 5>Nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you just put out a buffet in front </v>

3004
02:15:28.121 --> 02:15:29.950
<v Speaker 5>of the Grizzly bear and you're mad at </v>
<v Speaker 5>their eating.</v>

3005
02:15:30.310 --> 02:15:31.930
<v Speaker 5>It's bare supermarket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they had a,</v>

3006
02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:32.793
<v Speaker 5>he had a hunt them down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy watching this guy because </v>

3007
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:39.280
<v Speaker 5>although it is reality TV and you do not</v>
<v Speaker 5>know how much of this show is,</v>

3008
02:15:39.281 --> 02:15:41.980
<v Speaker 5>bullshit goes clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of it's bullshit.</v>

3009
02:15:42.070 --> 02:15:42.903
<v Speaker 5>There's clearly some setup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I saw one scene where they had a </v>

3010
02:15:45.851 --> 02:15:46.684
<v Speaker 5>filleted salmon and the bear was </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposedly getting fish from the river </v>

3011
02:15:50.410 --> 02:15:52.330
<v Speaker 5>and it was coming too close to them </v>
<v Speaker 5>while they're fishing.</v>

3012
02:15:52.331 --> 02:15:54.010
<v Speaker 5>But you never saw the two of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same frame.</v>

3013
02:15:54.250 --> 02:15:55.083
<v Speaker 5>And then you see the bear and the bear </v>
<v Speaker 5>has a salmon that's filleted meaning </v>

3014
02:15:58.421 --> 02:15:59.254
<v Speaker 5>like someone cut that Sam and threw it </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the water and gave it to the fucking </v>

3015
02:16:01.631 --> 02:16:03.100
<v Speaker 5>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like,</v>

3016
02:16:03.101 --> 02:16:04.540
<v Speaker 5>come on stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

3017
02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:07.690
<v Speaker 5>So you guys are the only people here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yet the bear,</v>

3018
02:16:07.691 --> 02:16:08.524
<v Speaker 5>you haven't caught a fish yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the bear is a fish that has filets </v>

3019
02:16:10.601 --> 02:16:13.360
<v Speaker 5>removed off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shut the fuck up man.</v>

3020
02:16:13.361 --> 02:16:14.194
<v Speaker 5>I'm not stupid.</v>

3021
02:16:15.250 --> 02:16:16.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>

3022
02:16:16.181 --> 02:16:17.014
<v Speaker 4>that's the TV game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it does give you like a little </v>

3023
02:16:18.731 --> 02:16:22.030
<v Speaker 4>window into the wild ways that all of us</v>
<v Speaker 4>humans live.</v>

3024
02:16:22.090 --> 02:16:23.800
<v Speaker 4>It gives a window,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is cool.</v>

3025
02:16:23.801 --> 02:16:24.634
<v Speaker 4>Like I got to um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this book before they pass away </v>

3026
02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:30.250
<v Speaker 4>and you gave me that book.</v>

3027
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:30.911
<v Speaker 2>Give me that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

3028
02:16:30.911 --> 02:16:33.370
<v Speaker 2>it looks amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing photos.</v>

3029
02:16:33.371 --> 02:16:35.590
<v Speaker 2>But then you start reading about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different cultures,</v>

3030
02:16:35.591 --> 02:16:38.870
<v Speaker 2>like actually had the photographer on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast and he was telling me about,</v>

3031
02:16:39.370 --> 02:16:40.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is his name?</v>

3032
02:16:40.901 --> 02:16:42.520
<v Speaker 2>It's called before they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pat Jimmy Nelson,</v>

3033
02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Nelson.</v>

3034
02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:45.880
<v Speaker 2>So Jimmy Nelson was on the podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3035
02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:46.833
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about the Himba people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which have these amazing photos or like </v>

3036
02:16:48.881 --> 02:16:51.280
<v Speaker 2>a really tall tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I believe it was the Himba.</v>

3037
02:16:51.730 --> 02:16:54.520
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was telling me about their custom,</v>

3038
02:16:54.610 --> 02:16:56.890
<v Speaker 2>they live in just such a dramatically </v>
<v Speaker 2>different way.</v>

3039
02:16:56.891 --> 02:16:59.890
<v Speaker 2>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like a pastoral shepherding kind</v>

3040
02:16:59.891 --> 02:17:01.780
<v Speaker 2>of tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have all of their cows,</v>

3041
02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:02.793
<v Speaker 2>but there's very little grass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the men have to take the cows on </v>

3042
02:17:05.591 --> 02:17:09.100
<v Speaker 2>these long walks to feed them like four </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks away.</v>

3043
02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:10.233
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what they do is they leave one man </v>

3044
02:17:12.881 --> 02:17:15.100
<v Speaker 2>behind in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the village,</v>

3045
02:17:15.130 --> 02:17:17.920
<v Speaker 2>and it's his job to sexually satisfy all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women,</v>

3046
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:19.500
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3047
02:17:19.501 --> 02:17:22.390
<v Speaker 2>all the men are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that position rotates,</v>

3048
02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:25.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that everybody gets their turn as the</v>

3049
02:17:25.691 --> 02:17:28.720
<v Speaker 2>one dude that gets to sexually satisfy </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire village.</v>

3050
02:17:28.750 --> 02:17:31.620
<v Speaker 2>One of girls get pissed if it's all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker turn.</v>

3051
02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hate is dirty.</v>

3052
02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Dig to watch this little tiny dirty </v>
<v Speaker 2>dance.</v>

3053
02:17:37.670 --> 02:17:41.440
<v Speaker 2>There's certain guys that they're never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're never on vacation for when it's,</v>

3054
02:17:41.441 --> 02:17:43.750
<v Speaker 2>that guy's turning around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some girls will hold out,</v>

3055
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:45.820
<v Speaker 2>but like I'm good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>

3056
02:17:45.821 --> 02:17:47.560
<v Speaker 2>You can go fuck my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna wait,</v>

3057
02:17:47.890 --> 02:17:51.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna wait until Igor is term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Igor slangs that good deck.</v>

3058
02:17:56.350 --> 02:17:57.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want that.</v>

3059
02:17:57.940 --> 02:18:00.440
<v Speaker 2>I only want her pleasure to come from my</v>
<v Speaker 2>penis.</v>

3060
02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Penis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard of the massage man.</v>

3061
02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:06.430
<v Speaker 2>The way he touched her anus come so </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>

3062
02:18:07.140 --> 02:18:07.973
<v Speaker 2>tim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With all my being one day I will remove </v>

3063
02:18:10.421 --> 02:18:15.370
<v Speaker 2>him from this life with a sword.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny that someone who you love,</v>

3064
02:18:15.550 --> 02:18:16.383
<v Speaker 2>someone else makes that person who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>love gives them pleasure and interfaith </v>

3065
02:18:19.870 --> 02:18:23.800
<v Speaker 2>their ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got her ass up in the air.</v>

3066
02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:26.190
<v Speaker 2>She's backing up into his tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

3067
02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:28.170
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>

3068
02:18:28.270 --> 02:18:29.051
<v Speaker 2>no new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new,</v>

3069
02:18:29.051 --> 02:18:29.501
<v Speaker 2>new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new,</v>

3070
02:18:29.501 --> 02:18:31.750
<v Speaker 2>new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that makes you vomit as</v>

3071
02:18:31.751 --> 02:18:34.510
<v Speaker 2>a man because it triggers these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>

3072
02:18:34.511 --> 02:18:37.990
<v Speaker 2>But it can all be worked through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can push through the other side</v>

3073
02:18:37.991 --> 02:18:39.160
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3074
02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:41.830
<v Speaker 2>or you could shoot yourself or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

3075
02:18:42.340 --> 02:18:43.173
<v Speaker 2>I think we played that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We played that country song where it's </v>

3076
02:18:44.801 --> 02:18:47.460

3084
02:19:02.081 --> 02:19:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Because here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When someone likes someone,</v>

02:19:04.031 --> 02:19:06.440
<v Speaker 2>they fucking like someone and you're </v>

<v Speaker 2>but he can't go walking naked.</v>

3091
02:19:15.911 --> 02:19:16.744
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna fucking freeze to death is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a reality of going outside when it's 30 </v>

3092
02:19:18.881 --> 02:19:19.930
<v Speaker 2>below zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3093
02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this is the same reality applies.</v>

3094
02:19:22.281 --> 02:19:23.114
<v Speaker 2>So when someone doesn't like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a girl does not wanna have sex with </v>

3095
02:19:25.391 --> 02:19:26.710
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she wants to fuck the rock,</v>

<v Speaker 1>could say about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I love you forever in eternity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not even like the body.</v>

3101
02:19:36.411 --> 02:19:38.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like the soul now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to work.</v>

3102
02:19:38.180 --> 02:19:41.750
<v Speaker 1>She's thinking of the rocket has giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>Samoan Dick just ramming it home.</v>

3103
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:44.180
<v Speaker 1>That's what she wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3104
02:19:44.210 --> 02:19:45.043
<v Speaker 1>you got to accept that and you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have to enjoy another aspect of life </v>

3105
02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:50.833
<v Speaker 1>other than having sex with one person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's now having sex with a rock or be </v>

3106
02:19:53.181 --> 02:19:54.680
<v Speaker 1>happy for her and be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's not going to happen once per,</v>

3108
02:19:57.680 --> 02:19:59.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just exactly.</v>

3109
02:19:59.331 --> 02:20:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Look at that photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that when he's holding one of the,</v>

3110
02:20:01.251 --> 02:20:01.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3111
02:20:01.740 --> 02:20:05.300
<v Speaker 1>he slings those fucking bigfoot's Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those primal bells that we have,</v>

3112
02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:07.340
<v Speaker 1>he slings that thing around like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

3113
02:20:07.460 --> 02:20:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an enormous human dude.</v>

3114
02:20:09.470 --> 02:20:11.240
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible to make that move,</v>

3115
02:20:11.241 --> 02:20:11.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3116
02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:14.180
<v Speaker 1>I've been working on it in my own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking possible.</v>

3117
02:20:14.181 --> 02:20:15.470
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard as fuck.</v>

3118
02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:16.333
<v Speaker 1>But you know you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can transcend these things were and </v>

3119
02:20:19.491 --> 02:20:21.740
<v Speaker 1>just understand that deeper metaphysical</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

3120
02:20:21.741 --> 02:20:24.800
<v Speaker 1>pleasure for someone I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes that person my friend,</v>

3121
02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:26.720
<v Speaker 1>not my enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

3122
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:29.960
<v Speaker 1>In theory I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for the sake of humor,</v>

3123
02:20:30.290 --> 02:20:35.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep talking shit about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rock banging your sister areas.</v>

3124
02:20:35.151 --> 02:20:37.130
<v Speaker 1>He's got a gorilla there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe he use two hands.</v>

3125
02:20:37.131 --> 02:20:39.230
<v Speaker 1>What a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I throw that around with one.</v>

3126
02:20:39.930 --> 02:20:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rock.</v>

3127
02:20:41.570 --> 02:20:43.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a strong human man and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3128
02:20:43.431 --> 02:20:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Just not just strong like physically but</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly.</v>

3129
02:20:46.620 --> 02:20:49.430
<v Speaker 1>His personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he projects himself.</v>

3130
02:20:49.431 --> 02:20:50.264
<v Speaker 1>Like he's a perfect example of someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who projects like this very positive </v>

3131
02:20:53.331 --> 02:20:54.620
<v Speaker 1>vibe man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3132
02:20:54.621 --> 02:20:57.050
<v Speaker 1>this is very energetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>

3133
02:20:57.051 --> 02:20:58.040
<v Speaker 1>happy vibe.</v>

3134
02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:01.220
<v Speaker 1>It's very infectious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I see that guy talking.</v>

3135
02:21:01.221 --> 02:21:03.450
<v Speaker 1>He does like youtube clips or instagram </v>
<v Speaker 1>clips rather.</v>

3136
02:21:03.451 --> 02:21:04.284
<v Speaker 1>A little videos he makes and his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his positivity and genuine enthusiasm </v>

3137
02:21:08.361 --> 02:21:13.130
<v Speaker 1>and happiness is so infectious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking fan boy of the rock.</v>

3138
02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking said it.</v>

3139
02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3140
02:21:17.031 --> 02:21:19.760
<v Speaker 1>he's got a great bit Andrew Santina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3141
02:21:19.761 --> 02:21:22.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to give out a word of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a word.</v>

3142
02:21:22.190 --> 02:21:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot even,</v>

3143
02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:24.433
<v Speaker 1>but if you get a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Santiago has a fucking hilarious </v>

3144
02:21:27.441 --> 02:21:29.450
<v Speaker 1>bit about the rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

3145
02:21:29.451 --> 02:21:31.010
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny.</v>

3146
02:21:32.030 --> 02:21:34.430
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of person,</v>

3147
02:21:34.431 --> 02:21:36.090
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those are fuel,</v>

3148
02:21:36.091 --> 02:21:36.501
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are,</v>

3149
02:21:36.501 --> 02:21:38.070
<v Speaker 1>that's human fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's like a,</v>

3150
02:21:38.071 --> 02:21:39.320
<v Speaker 1>a light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

3151
02:21:39.380 --> 02:21:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3152
02:21:40.291 --> 02:21:41.124
<v Speaker 1>I've come to look at ourselves like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a software operating system that </v>

3153
02:21:43.761 --> 02:21:44.594
<v Speaker 1>can constantly get rewritten a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit by even by the people that you're </v>

3154
02:21:46.911 --> 02:21:47.661
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3155
02:21:47.661 --> 02:21:48.494
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to look from the point of like </v>

3156
02:21:49.671 --> 02:21:50.504
<v Speaker 1>mirror neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually experiencing the same </v>

3157
02:21:52.881 --> 02:21:55.090
<v Speaker 1>emotional state that the person you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and,</v>

3158
02:21:55.100 --> 02:21:58.390
<v Speaker 1>or if it's just ideas or thoughts or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to,</v>

3159
02:21:58.430 --> 02:22:01.610
<v Speaker 1>however you want to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like adding a little bit of code to</v>

3160
02:22:01.611 --> 02:22:02.390
<v Speaker 1>our code base.</v>

3161
02:22:02.390 --> 02:22:04.760
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it's helpful and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a virus,</v>

3162
02:22:04.940 --> 02:22:08.210
<v Speaker 1>but the more you surround yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people with that kind of positive vibe,</v>

3163
02:22:08.211 --> 02:22:11.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like building on the software in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive way.</v>

3164
02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:13.730
<v Speaker 1>When you're around these more negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3165
02:22:13.731 --> 02:22:15.770
<v Speaker 1>they're implanting different little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3166
02:22:15.771 --> 02:22:19.280
<v Speaker 1>bugs and viruses that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to scan and remove later.</v>

3167
02:22:19.430 --> 02:22:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Essentially all open source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3168
02:22:21.410 --> 02:22:24.140
<v Speaker 1>100% open source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some beings are open source but uh,</v>

3169
02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine your firewall.</v>

3170
02:22:26.610 --> 02:22:27.870
<v Speaker 4>Totally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>

3171
02:22:27.871 --> 02:22:28.704
<v Speaker 4>Should I be careful?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put yourself in situations where you're </v>

3172
02:22:30.751 --> 02:22:33.420
<v Speaker 4>adding to that positive code base,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the books you're reading,</v>

3173
02:22:33.421 --> 02:22:35.190
<v Speaker 4>the things you're listening to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3174
02:22:35.191 --> 02:22:36.024
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and be careful of the things on tv to </v>

3175
02:22:37.231 --> 02:22:38.890
<v Speaker 4>that are adding to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3176
02:22:38.970 --> 02:22:39.803
<v Speaker 4>creating more of the viruses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reince like supporting these negative </v>

3177
02:22:42.991 --> 02:22:43.920
<v Speaker 4>thought patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

3178
02:22:44.100 --> 02:22:44.933
<v Speaker 4>these limiting beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these things that are not helpful for </v>

3179
02:22:47.011 --> 02:22:47.844
<v Speaker 4>the coaches,</v>

3180
02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:48.903
<v Speaker 5>committed to do these things that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have in your idea and in your mind like </v>

3181
02:22:52.811 --> 02:22:53.644
<v Speaker 5>don't be so set in your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause understand that people have to be </v>

3182
02:22:56.261 --> 02:22:57.094
<v Speaker 5>just as sat in their ideas in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll lash someone for being in close </v>

3183
02:23:00.971 --> 02:23:05.020
<v Speaker 5>proximity with a man or to lash.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone who had sex with a woman.</v>

3184
02:23:05.300 --> 02:23:06.970
<v Speaker 5>You know those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those people have the same.</v>

3185
02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:07.833
<v Speaker 5>Or to wait til a woman who's pregnant </v>
<v Speaker 5>gives birth before you give her a </v>

3186
02:23:10.961 --> 02:23:13.750
<v Speaker 5>beating with a stick because she had </v>
<v Speaker 5>sex.</v>

3187
02:23:14.020 --> 02:23:14.853
<v Speaker 5>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those people believe what they believe </v>

3188
02:23:17.050 --> 02:23:17.883
<v Speaker 5>just as firmly and a lot of the notions </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we have that we think there are </v>

3189
02:23:20.951 --> 02:23:21.784
<v Speaker 5>rigid rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not rigid rules except dudes </v>

3190
02:23:24.581 --> 02:23:26.200

<v Speaker 4>Steven Seagal.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He gave it up and we were pat.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I got some man been friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be disappointed.</v>

3201
02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:55.220
<v Speaker 4>I know they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're trying hard.</v>

3202
02:23:55.221 --> 02:23:58.140
<v Speaker 4>They're trying hard to wear that vest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3203
02:23:58.210 --> 02:24:01.100
<v Speaker 4>Those weird shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wooden soles,</v>

3204
02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:02.173
<v Speaker 4>everybody just j everybody's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for love and they're looking to </v>

3205
02:24:04.271 --> 02:24:06.260
<v Speaker 4>judge themselves as a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3206
02:24:06.261 --> 02:24:07.100
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

3207
02:24:07.430 --> 02:24:08.263
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are two things that you can get </v>

3208
02:24:09.711 --> 02:24:10.640
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3209
02:24:10.641 --> 02:24:11.474
<v Speaker 4>you can understand that you're worthy of</v>
<v Speaker 4>love and supply that and you can </v>

3210
02:24:13.521 --> 02:24:16.130
<v Speaker 4>understand that you're a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just being a person.</v>

3211
02:24:16.131 --> 02:24:17.330
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3212
02:24:17.331 --> 02:24:18.830
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to be better than </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody.</v>

3213
02:24:18.831 --> 02:24:21.800
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to shit on somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to have this identity,</v>

3214
02:24:22.010 --> 02:24:23.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody could just relax.</v>

3215
02:24:23.641 --> 02:24:27.350
<v Speaker 4>Then I think all of a lot of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>striving and conflict and suffering,</v>

3216
02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:29.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just fucking falls away.</v>

3217
02:24:29.421 --> 02:24:33.680
<v Speaker 4>Like it's so easy to say like that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful concept.</v>

3218
02:24:33.681 --> 02:24:34.430
<v Speaker 4>You're worthy of love,</v>

3219
02:24:34.430 --> 02:24:35.263
<v Speaker 5>love.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think people have to experience a </v>

3220
02:24:35.961 --> 02:24:39.290
<v Speaker 5>certain amount of difficulty in their </v>
<v Speaker 5>life just to exercise their system.</v>

3221
02:24:39.650 --> 02:24:40.483
<v Speaker 5>I think our system is put in place to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a certain amount of obstacles to </v>

3222
02:24:43.101 --> 02:24:43.934
<v Speaker 5>overcome and when we don't have any or </v>
<v Speaker 5>when it's like really simple stuff </v>

3223
02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:48.500
<v Speaker 5>that's fucking boring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3224
02:24:48.530 --> 02:24:50.810
<v Speaker 5>I think people have real problems with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3225
02:24:51.020 --> 02:24:54.020
<v Speaker 5>I think we have real problems with our </v>
<v Speaker 5>minds,</v>

3226
02:24:54.050 --> 02:24:56.240
<v Speaker 5>real problems physically with our entire</v>
<v Speaker 5>unit.</v>

3227
02:24:56.870 --> 02:25:00.980
<v Speaker 5>I think we absolutely need a certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of exertion,</v>

3228
02:25:01.580 --> 02:25:02.350
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3229
02:25:02.350 --> 02:25:04.730
<v Speaker 5>and my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean in might not even be physical.</v>

3230
02:25:04.970 --> 02:25:05.480
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3231
02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:06.313
<v Speaker 5>my friend drawn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drawn Horton and went to Colorado with </v>

3232
02:25:08.751 --> 02:25:09.680
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We did a gig out there.</v>

3233
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:13.820
<v Speaker 5>He just got into chess just a madman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the chest now playing on his phone,</v>

3234
02:25:13.821 --> 02:25:15.710
<v Speaker 5>constantly moving things around and he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3235
02:25:15.711 --> 02:25:16.281
<v Speaker 5>you want to play?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3236
02:25:16.281 --> 02:25:17.114
<v Speaker 5>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not getting sucked into that God </v>

3237
02:25:18.291 --> 02:25:20.780
<v Speaker 5>damn rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see him there on the plane.</v>

3238
02:25:20.781 --> 02:25:23.120
<v Speaker 5>Can't wait to play chess since we're off</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the sky.</v>

3239
02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 5>I'll fucking with his</v>

3240
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:24.843
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

3241
02:25:25.810 --> 02:25:28.720
<v Speaker 1>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is another discipline.</v>

3242
02:25:28.721 --> 02:25:29.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all disciplines.</v>

3243
02:25:29.741 --> 02:25:33.190
<v Speaker 1>They're all these different things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to seek truth through.</v>

3244
02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chess is a form of combat,</v>

3245
02:25:35.850 --> 02:25:37.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not painful,</v>

3246
02:25:37.540 --> 02:25:38.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's most certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3247
02:25:38.831 --> 02:25:41.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of combat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely a form of,</v>

3248
02:25:41.950 --> 02:25:43.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3249
02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:44.193
<v Speaker 1>if you treat it as a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is essentially what you're </v>

3250
02:25:45.881 --> 02:25:46.714
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're breaking it down to a very </v>

3251
02:25:48.371 --> 02:25:52.690
<v Speaker 1>innocuous but very safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very obvious what's going on.</v>

3252
02:25:52.750 --> 02:25:56.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm testing my intellect against your </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect and we're going to do it.</v>

3253
02:25:56.590 --> 02:26:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Do so through a very established series </v>
<v Speaker 1>of movements of these things are allowed</v>

3254
02:26:01.091 --> 02:26:02.440
<v Speaker 1>to participate in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a,</v>

3255
02:26:02.441 --> 02:26:04.930
<v Speaker 1>a established playing field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the rules.</v>

3256
02:26:04.931 --> 02:26:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I know the real rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm smarter than you go.</v>

3257
02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:10.450
<v Speaker 1>And you have that little clock thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that those dudes to have those dudes,</v>

3258
02:26:10.451 --> 02:26:11.620
<v Speaker 1>they fuck they fuck with you.</v>

3259
02:26:11.620 --> 02:26:13.570
<v Speaker 1>So they move it quick and then eat that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking clock.</v>

3260
02:26:13.870 --> 02:26:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you want to move a quick tool.</v>

3261
02:26:15.851 --> 02:26:17.500
<v Speaker 1>You want to say fuck you bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

3262
02:26:17.530 --> 02:26:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

3263
02:26:18.110 --> 02:26:18.521
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

3264
02:26:18.521 --> 02:26:18.941
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

3265
02:26:18.941 --> 02:26:19.361
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

3266
02:26:19.361 --> 02:26:20.194
<v Speaker 1>clack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see them giving up pieces and </v>

3267
02:26:20.921 --> 02:26:23.150
<v Speaker 1>moving fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's some mental war.</v>

3268
02:26:23.151 --> 02:26:28.151
<v Speaker 1>They're playing a mental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a strategic conquest game.</v>

3269
02:26:28.930 --> 02:26:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's uh,</v>

3270
02:26:30.530 --> 02:26:31.440
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one,</v>

3271
02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:33.430
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that discipline,</v>

3272
02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:35.680
<v Speaker 1>there's so many ways up the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need a mountain.</v>

3273
02:26:35.700 --> 02:26:36.880
<v Speaker 1>You need something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a mountain.</v>

3274
02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:37.751
<v Speaker 1>I met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

3275
02:26:37.751 --> 02:26:40.130
<v Speaker 1>it's not mutually exclusive to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3276
02:26:40.270 --> 02:26:43.510
<v Speaker 1>the self love aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can still find your mountain,</v>

3277
02:26:43.630 --> 02:26:44.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without thinking you're a piece of shit </v>

3278
02:26:45.401 --> 02:26:47.770
<v Speaker 1>when you stumble because everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking stumbles.</v>

3279
02:26:47.771 --> 02:26:48.604
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you're a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that you should hate </v>

3280
02:26:49.931 --> 02:26:50.510
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

3281
02:26:50.510 --> 02:26:51.343
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that you should isolate </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself from the love of the world </v>

3282
02:26:53.111 --> 02:26:53.944
<v Speaker 1>because you feel you're not worthy of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and is create these negative patterns </v>

3283
02:26:56.771 --> 02:26:57.581
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3284
02:26:57.581 --> 02:26:59.950

<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3286
02:27:02.681 --> 02:27:04.930
<v Speaker 1>That's just life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're all going to stumble.</v>

3287
02:27:04.931 --> 02:27:07.510
<v Speaker 1>You just get up and keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you bitch,</v>

<v Speaker 1>me is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing.</v>

3306
02:27:59.381 --> 02:28:00.214
<v Speaker 1>It's like I can do it but I'm always </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the consequences of this like </v>

3307
02:28:02.981 --> 02:28:05.590
<v Speaker 1>little bit of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really not worth it.</v>

3308
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Like I do it because my family likes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

3309
02:28:07.901 --> 02:28:09.820
<v Speaker 1>but part of me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fall down bitch.</v>

3310
02:28:09.821 --> 02:28:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Don't fall down bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't fall down bitch.</v>

3311
02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go again.</v>

3312
02:28:13.450 --> 02:28:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Don't fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't fall down.</v>

3313
02:28:17.410 --> 02:28:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

3314
02:28:18.971 --> 02:28:21.100
<v Speaker 1>And if I was better at it would probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>be even more fun,</v>

3315
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:22.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3316
02:28:22.611 --> 02:28:25.580
<v Speaker 1>I know too many people that have fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>their bodies up skiing.</v>

3317
02:28:25.610 --> 02:28:26.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blown their neat cap up to the side of </v>

3318
02:28:29.781 --> 02:28:34.090
<v Speaker 1>their hip and their fucking legs broken </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven places and their next never moving</v>

3319
02:28:34.091 --> 02:28:36.200
<v Speaker 1>to the left ever again and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3320
02:28:36.201 --> 02:28:37.520
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hit a tree.</v>

3321
02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the lucky ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's people.</v>

3322
02:28:40.610 --> 02:28:43.850
<v Speaker 1>That's why people liked skiing and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>why people like riding a motorcycle,</v>

3323
02:28:43.851 --> 02:28:44.684
<v Speaker 1>it's like the stakes are high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the stakes are high you have to </v>

3324
02:28:47.031 --> 02:28:49.250
<v Speaker 1>focus on what you're doing then your </v>
<v Speaker 1>present again.</v>

3325
02:28:49.310 --> 02:28:51.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3326
02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:52.610
<v Speaker 1>you got to get better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

3327
02:28:52.850 --> 02:28:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Just coming up with bitch ass excuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

3328
02:28:57.770 --> 02:28:58.730
<v Speaker 1>it's what's easier.</v>

3329
02:28:58.730 --> 02:29:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Snowboarding or skiing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skiing,</v>

3330
02:29:00.591 --> 02:29:03.080
<v Speaker 1>I think really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least for,</v>

3331
02:29:03.081 --> 02:29:04.730
<v Speaker 1>at least for me when I've tried it </v>
<v Speaker 1>snowboarding,</v>

3332
02:29:04.731 --> 02:29:05.564
<v Speaker 1>the falls are way gnarlier because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you fall and you catch like your toe </v>

3333
02:29:11.691 --> 02:29:13.370
<v Speaker 1>edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you slam back.</v>

3334
02:29:13.490 --> 02:29:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten,</v>

3335
02:29:15.650 --> 02:29:16.483
<v Speaker 1>I hit my head so hard coming from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>steep mountain down into a flat and </v>

3336
02:29:20.001 --> 02:29:21.800
<v Speaker 1>caught an edge on this icy part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3337
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I hit the back of my head so hard that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the front of my goggle lenses popped off</v>

3338
02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:27.583
<v Speaker 1>into the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking pop tart out of a </v>

3339
02:29:29.151 --> 02:29:30.440
<v Speaker 1>toaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3340
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:32.780
<v Speaker 1>And I was fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I couldn't just,</v>

3341
02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:33.763
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3342
02:29:34.150 --> 02:29:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Cause I woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were like helpfully,</v>

3343
02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:39.020
<v Speaker 1>like terrified helpfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

3344
02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:40.790
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that probably wouldn't happen to your</v>

3345
02:29:40.791 --> 02:29:41.510
<v Speaker 1>skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

3346
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:42.343
<v Speaker 1>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's less likely because the way </v>

3347
02:29:43.641 --> 02:29:46.570
<v Speaker 1>that you catch that edge and just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hook up the hookup,</v>

3348
02:29:46.610 --> 02:29:50.390
<v Speaker 1>the board and it's like a slingshot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just slams your head back down.</v>

3349
02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:51.373
<v Speaker 1>We're skiing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll like usually skid out or tumble </v>

3350
02:29:53.781 --> 02:29:54.460
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3351
02:29:54.460 --> 02:29:55.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of those things.</v>

3352
02:29:55.491 --> 02:29:57.050
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the con,</v>

3353
02:29:57.080 --> 02:29:57.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why it makes it harder to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn because there's these fucking </v>

3354
02:30:00.201 --> 02:30:04.200
<v Speaker 1>fatal crashes you do on a snowboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3355
02:30:04.330 --> 02:30:05.163
<v Speaker 1>And skiing to men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes some people get too close to </v>

3356
02:30:07.341 --> 02:30:08.750
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's another problem.</v>

3357
02:30:08.751 --> 02:30:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't know how to control </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

3358
02:30:10.191 --> 02:30:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3359
02:30:10.910 --> 02:30:11.743
<v Speaker 1>And they're kind of like out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to kind of like adjust </v>

3360
02:30:14.451 --> 02:30:16.820
<v Speaker 1>quickly to get away from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3361
02:30:16.821 --> 02:30:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this lady was coming down like,</v>

3362
02:30:18.740 --> 02:30:19.573
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it looked like she was going to go </v>

3363
02:30:20.631 --> 02:30:21.740
<v Speaker 1>down hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she,</v>

3364
02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:22.820
<v Speaker 1>she got by me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3365
02:30:22.850 --> 02:30:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a ductus lady.</v>

3366
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:27.710
<v Speaker 1>And so I had to take a hard left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the trees are right there.</v>

3367
02:30:27.711 --> 02:30:28.401
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

3368
02:30:28.401 --> 02:30:30.350
<v Speaker 1>I gotta take a hard right and hope it </v>
<v Speaker 1>ain't working.</v>

3369
02:30:30.830 --> 02:30:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I started.</v>

3370
02:30:32.180 --> 02:30:34.400
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fine,</v>

3371
02:30:34.401 --> 02:30:35.200
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

3372
02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:36.033
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that can go wrong if you're in the </v>

3373
02:30:38.061 --> 02:30:38.894
<v Speaker 1>wrong spot when that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if there's a tree there and you </v>

3374
02:30:40.731 --> 02:30:41.564
<v Speaker 1>cannot get away from that tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you gotta be real fucking careful </v>

3375
02:30:45.471 --> 02:30:47.720
<v Speaker 1>who you zig and zag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take that bitch out next time.</v>

3376
02:30:48.540 --> 02:30:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Like if we're near a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry Lady.</v>

3377
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:51.800
<v Speaker 1>We're both going down together hoping </v>
<v Speaker 1>not to fall.</v>

3378
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Fucking good to say don't swerve for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deer.</v>

3379
02:30:55.430 --> 02:30:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3380
02:30:56.511 --> 02:30:58.190
<v Speaker 1>He's supposed to just hit the gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3381
02:30:58.280 --> 02:30:59.113
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3382
02:31:00.840 --> 02:31:03.530
<v Speaker 1>He's supposed to not do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was just let it hit your car,</v>

3383
02:31:03.531 --> 02:31:04.364
<v Speaker 1>but that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like saying don't blink with </v>

3384
02:31:05.661 --> 02:31:06.494
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>punches you.</v>

3385
02:31:06.900 --> 02:31:07.733
<v Speaker 1>How many deers do you get to hit before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize not to hit the gas like it </v>

3386
02:31:10.431 --> 02:31:11.750
<v Speaker 1>takes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be like,</v>

3387
02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:14.300
<v Speaker 1>like you ever seen a picture of Floyd </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mayweather eating a jab?</v>

3388
02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:15.313
<v Speaker 1>Like he's cutting a punch to the face </v>
<v Speaker 1>but his eyes are wide open and he's </v>

3389
02:31:17.271 --> 02:31:20.100
<v Speaker 1>punching back because he's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioned to being</v>

3390
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:20.933
<v Speaker 4>punchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So used to it that he can keep his eyes </v>

3391
02:31:22.471 --> 02:31:24.870
<v Speaker 4>open as the punches are coming in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then counter perfectly.</v>

3392
02:31:25.410 --> 02:31:27.150
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to have that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>resolve with a deer.</v>

3393
02:31:27.230 --> 02:31:28.380
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to hit that break.</v>

3394
02:31:28.570 --> 02:31:29.403
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to swerve good again when </v>

3395
02:31:30.691 --> 02:31:31.524
<v Speaker 4>them giant fucking meat cleaver bumpers </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they have like people live in </v>

3396
02:31:34.351 --> 02:31:37.500
<v Speaker 4>Wyoming and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have those road warrior bumpers and</v>

3397
02:31:37.501 --> 02:31:38.334
<v Speaker 4>the trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just makes different stakes cut and </v>

3398
02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:45.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm like t bone and then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like extruded like Plato.</v>

3399
02:31:45.210 --> 02:31:46.043
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to like some places you can't </v>

3400
02:31:48.450 --> 02:31:50.550
<v Speaker 4>just throw it in the back of your truck </v>
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

3401
02:31:50.551 --> 02:31:51.384
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to kind of call somebody and </v>
<v Speaker 4>prove that you hit it that way cause </v>

3402
02:31:53.491 --> 02:31:55.730
<v Speaker 4>they want to discourage poaching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

3403
02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:57.073
<v Speaker 4>Well it makes a lot of sense man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But fuck deer jumping in front of your </v>

3404
02:32:04.951 --> 02:32:05.730
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>

3405
02:32:05.730 --> 02:32:07.110
<v Speaker 4>What are the odds that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

3406
02:32:07.111 --> 02:32:09.180
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't hit those brakes.</v>

3407
02:32:09.181 --> 02:32:12.660
<v Speaker 4>Remember they said just don't swerve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just hit the deer.</v>

3408
02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:14.453
<v Speaker 4>I think some people are better at that </v>
<v Speaker 4>super calm moment of like decision </v>

3409
02:32:18.031 --> 02:32:18.864
<v Speaker 4>making and crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I've been around people in certain </v>

3410
02:32:21.451 --> 02:32:24.450
<v Speaker 4>situations that like are you can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>prepare for.</v>

3411
02:32:24.451 --> 02:32:27.860
<v Speaker 4>And then there's some people who just </v>
<v Speaker 4>freeze like straight fucking freeze.</v>

3412
02:32:27.861 --> 02:32:28.694
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then some people act and I think </v>

3413
02:32:29.491 --> 02:32:33.120
<v Speaker 4>like all like off police officers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>military,</v>

3414
02:32:33.121 --> 02:32:35.160
<v Speaker 4>they train yourself past the freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's funny,</v>

3415
02:32:35.161 --> 02:32:35.994
<v Speaker 4>like I was in Australia and this dude </v>
<v Speaker 4>was drinking Bundaberg over proof rum </v>

3416
02:32:40.650 --> 02:32:43.980
<v Speaker 4>and he was used to doing this trick with</v>
<v Speaker 4>regular butter proof from,</v>

3417
02:32:43.981 --> 02:32:44.814
<v Speaker 4>which is Bundaberg rum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where he lights it on fire and pours it </v>

3418
02:32:47.291 --> 02:32:49.290
<v Speaker 4>in his mouth and it goes out when it </v>
<v Speaker 4>hits his mouth.</v>

3419
02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:52.890
<v Speaker 4>But he was doing it instead with over </v>
<v Speaker 4>proof from right.</v>

3420
02:32:52.890 --> 02:32:54.420
<v Speaker 4>Was He never done before?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3421
02:32:54.421 --> 02:32:55.254
<v Speaker 4>the thing was over proof from is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>mother fucker doesn't go out ever </v>

3422
02:32:57.451 --> 02:32:58.284
<v Speaker 4>period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the wind is not going to get it </v>

3423
02:32:59.301 --> 02:33:00.134
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's pouring his flaming shot and it </v>

3424
02:33:02.041 --> 02:33:04.200
<v Speaker 4>doesn't go out and so it's face catches </v>
<v Speaker 4>fire.</v>

3425
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:05.063
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Full full on hell raiser face catches </v>

3426
02:33:07.351 --> 02:33:08.184
<v Speaker 4>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's in the kitchen of the house we're </v>

3427
02:33:08.791 --> 02:33:12.570
<v Speaker 4>renting and like everybody is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at him,</v>

3428
02:33:12.571 --> 02:33:14.250
<v Speaker 4>he's clawing and his face is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>working.</v>

3429
02:33:14.251 --> 02:33:19.160
<v Speaker 4>Obviously he doesn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I'm looking at them and I don't</v>

3430
02:33:19.170 --> 02:33:21.120
<v Speaker 4>know what the fuck to do and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 4>just staying there.</v>

3431
02:33:21.121 --> 02:33:24.760
<v Speaker 4>So I go to the Faucet and I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to get water and like spray it on</v>

3432
02:33:24.780 --> 02:33:26.190
<v Speaker 4>from the fall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the right thing.</v>

3433
02:33:26.191 --> 02:33:28.530
<v Speaker 4>I should have put like a towel or a roof</v>
<v Speaker 4>over his head,</v>

3434
02:33:28.740 --> 02:33:29.573
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you just don't think you're not </v>

3435
02:33:30.961 --> 02:33:32.370
<v Speaker 4>prepared at that moment.</v>

3436
02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:33.660
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

3437
02:33:34.020 --> 02:33:37.200
<v Speaker 4>and then so eventually he fucking rolls </v>
<v Speaker 4>around on the ground and gets it,</v>

3438
02:33:37.530 --> 02:33:38.363
<v Speaker 4>get figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got burned but it was more like a </v>

3439
02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:42.000
<v Speaker 4>facial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like took the,</v>

3440
02:33:42.090 --> 02:33:45.180
<v Speaker 4>took the first layer off and he had like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a nice laser peel.</v>

3441
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:46.103
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when someone goes does that and it </v>

3442
02:33:47.101 --> 02:33:48.980
<v Speaker 4>doesn't say anything and you sort of go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3443
02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.190
<v Speaker 4>did you just visit the sun a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that?</v>

3444
02:33:53.191 --> 02:33:55.860
<v Speaker 4>He ended up ended up being fine but I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>been around other people.</v>

3445
02:33:56.100 --> 02:33:58.770
<v Speaker 4>Like another incident,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like a home stripper pole.</v>

3446
02:33:58.800 --> 02:33:59.690
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was there with,</v>

3447
02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:03.180
<v Speaker 4>I was there with Roger where ty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right and how's you should never buy,</v>

3448
02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:04.343
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about a haunted house or </v>
<v Speaker 4>your own poles alum superbad ago and it </v>

3449
02:34:07.801 --> 02:34:08.634
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was tied to the wall and this girl </v>

3450
02:34:10.171 --> 02:34:12.330
<v Speaker 4>gets on there and she's swinging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a little bit bigger.</v>

3451
02:34:12.650 --> 02:34:14.190
<v Speaker 4>We're all around the raw kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>laughing.</v>

3452
02:34:14.191 --> 02:34:15.840
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's clothes were all just </v>
<v Speaker 4>laughing and,</v>

3453
02:34:16.140 --> 02:34:18.250
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the pole goes</v>

3454
02:34:18.250 --> 02:34:19.083
<v Speaker 2>like on hinges from the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going timber from like 10 feet up </v>

3455
02:34:23.980 --> 02:34:26.380
<v Speaker 2>inverted like it's going to be really </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

3456
02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:31.560
<v Speaker 2>And literally everybody around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>circle just looked like this is going to</v>

3457
02:34:32.471 --> 02:34:33.304
<v Speaker 2>be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Roger just quickly like immediately </v>

3458
02:34:35.141 --> 02:34:38.380
<v Speaker 2>moves over and like grabs the Paul </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] style.</v>

3459
02:34:38.640 --> 02:34:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's when I realized like that's a</v>

<v Speaker 2>different dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a dude that when that totally </v>

3461
02:34:43.481 --> 02:34:44.314
<v Speaker 2>random thing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has the ability to act instead of </v>

3462
02:34:47.411 --> 02:34:50.410
<v Speaker 2>just look around like all of us dummies </v>
<v Speaker 2>like damn,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3464
02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:54.580

<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

3465
02:34:54.730 --> 02:34:55.563
<v Speaker 2>Well Rogers,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That was a giant giant football player.</v>

3468
02:35:01.780 --> 02:35:02.613
<v Speaker 2>Football player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is when Roger was fighting in the </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's not a big guy.</v>

3471
02:35:08.500 --> 02:35:11.680
<v Speaker 2>And this a football player who knows </v>

<v Speaker 2>to a lot.</v>

3476
02:35:19.901 --> 02:35:21.460
<v Speaker 2>I just happened to be out of town that </v>

<v Speaker 2>And then she's like the whole thing </v>

<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

3482
02:35:34.691 --> 02:35:36.700
<v Speaker 2>you get us a little bit of red there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

3483
02:35:36.701 --> 02:35:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Here comes boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3484
02:35:38.381 --> 02:35:41.290
<v Speaker 2>watch this punches are right in the back</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the head.</v>

3485
02:35:41.890 --> 02:35:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just flattens or,</v>

3486
02:35:45.100 --> 02:35:46.750
<v Speaker 2>and then walks away and everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3487
02:35:46.751 --> 02:35:47.920
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

3488
02:35:48.270 --> 02:35:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this guy is huge.</v>

3489
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:51.820
<v Speaker 2>And look at Roger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roger walks up to him.</v>

3490
02:35:51.821 --> 02:35:53.530
<v Speaker 2>He's literally a hundred pounds lighter </v>
<v Speaker 2>than him.</v>

3491
02:35:54.240 --> 02:35:55.140
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kidding.</v>

3492
02:35:55.160 --> 02:35:56.740
<v Speaker 2>And Roger starts talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just says,</v>

3493
02:35:56.741 --> 02:35:58.870
<v Speaker 2>at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that man.</v>

3494
02:35:59.260 --> 02:36:00.430
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3495
02:36:01.090 --> 02:36:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Roger Walks up and decides,</v>

3496
02:36:03.821 --> 02:36:04.654
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking my shirt off and takes his </v>

3497
02:36:05.951 --> 02:36:06.784
<v Speaker 2>shirt off because he doesn't want to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to grab his shirt like he's </v>

3498
02:36:09.041 --> 02:36:10.960
<v Speaker 2>thinking strategically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3499
02:36:10.961 --> 02:36:11.794
<v Speaker 2>which is like way one step ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like he's going to physically </v>

3500
02:36:13.661 --> 02:36:15.160
<v Speaker 2>intimidate this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy's giant.</v>

3501
02:36:15.850 --> 02:36:20.850
<v Speaker 2>And so roger standing in front of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and the dude's big and it looks like</v>

3502
02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:24.070
<v Speaker 2>somebody else tried to jump into </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else,</v>

3503
02:36:24.071 --> 02:36:28.660
<v Speaker 2>tried to jump in on both sides and stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>them from fighting the guy that guy runs</v>

3504
02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:32.230
<v Speaker 2>and then roger corners corners and by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truck,</v>

3505
02:36:32.231 --> 02:36:33.910
<v Speaker 2>what you can't see you going on right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

3506
02:36:34.040 --> 02:36:35.740
<v Speaker 2>corn is and by the truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy swings,</v>

3507
02:36:35.741 --> 02:36:36.574
<v Speaker 2>Roger Somehow gets a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>muy Thai clinch and started kneeing him </v>

3508
02:36:38.831 --> 02:36:43.620
<v Speaker 2>in the head and knees him in the head </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he gets them out of hosting and</v>

3509
02:36:43.630 --> 02:36:47.530
<v Speaker 2>stomps him and then runs hold pride </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules style.</v>

3510
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:51.220
<v Speaker 2>And this all happens in 1520 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not even.</v>

3511
02:36:51.250 --> 02:36:52.420
<v Speaker 2>It was really quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3512
02:36:52.421 --> 02:36:53.254
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole video is only two minutes and </v>

3513
02:36:54.521 --> 02:36:59.230
<v Speaker 2>28 seconds long and it became this viral</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic kit.</v>

3514
02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:01.660
<v Speaker 2>Whatever happened to that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he get in trouble for that?</v>

3515
02:37:02.070 --> 02:37:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3516
02:37:04.030 --> 02:37:06.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that the police knew,</v>

3517
02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:06.933
<v Speaker 2>obviously the roger hit him and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just basically shook his hand and we're </v>

3518
02:37:09.611 --> 02:37:10.331
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

02:37:31.251 --> 02:37:33.020
<v Speaker 1>might freeze or might not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3532
02:37:33.021 --> 02:37:35.150
<v Speaker 1>he has a brutal upbringing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3533
02:37:35.151 --> 02:37:39.350
<v Speaker 1>And I think sometimes people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome brutality when they're younger,</v>

3534
02:37:39.351 --> 02:37:41.570
<v Speaker 1>they developed this ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand like,</v>

3535
02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:42.590
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been here before.</v>

3536
02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:45.230
<v Speaker 1>I know what this is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what this kind of chaos is.</v>

3537
02:37:45.420 --> 02:37:46.760
<v Speaker 1>And there's only one way out of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3538
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:51.410
<v Speaker 1>You got to meet it head on where someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>is coddled who grows up and you know,</v>

3539
02:37:51.411 --> 02:37:53.000
<v Speaker 1>a cushion room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

3540
02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:53.863
<v Speaker 1>Everything's dolls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no sharp edges that that person when </v>

3541
02:37:56.241 --> 02:37:59.840
<v Speaker 1>confronted with some horrific situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some giant steroids up,</v>

3542
02:37:59.841 --> 02:38:00.674
<v Speaker 1>football player punches a girl in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of the head and you've got to act </v>

3543
02:38:03.170 --> 02:38:04.003
<v Speaker 1>and that guy's a hundred pounds bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you and Roger just takes the shirt </v>

3544
02:38:06.591 --> 02:38:07.424
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

3545
02:38:08.890 --> 02:38:09.531
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

3546
02:38:09.531 --> 02:38:11.200
<v Speaker 1>well I can't have him grab me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3547
02:38:12.350 --> 02:38:13.890
<v Speaker 1>that's the dude you don't wanna fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

3548
02:38:13.900 --> 02:38:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unemotional dude.</v>

3549
02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I really wished that that he didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that falling out with UFC.</v>

3550
02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:19.873
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People forget the Roger worked or was </v>

3551
02:38:20.571 --> 02:38:24.500
<v Speaker 1>the first guy to ever be on the cover of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports illustrated for MMA.</v>

3552
02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:26.560
<v Speaker 1>He was on the fucking cover of sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrated.</v>

3553
02:38:26.580 --> 02:38:29.630
<v Speaker 1>He was being groomed as one of the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

3554
02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:32.780
<v Speaker 1>but there was some sort of dispute </v>
<v Speaker 1>between him and the UFC.</v>

3555
02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Who knows which side is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what happened,</v>

3556
02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:37.490
<v Speaker 1>but he wound up leaving the UFC and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

3557
02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:38.333
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just won his last fight so I have to </v>

3558
02:38:39.871 --> 02:38:41.300
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he in one now?</v>

3559
02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Was he fighting over one RC?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One FC.</v>

3560
02:38:43.531 --> 02:38:44.660

<v Speaker 1>The bell tour,</v>

3574
02:39:10.590 --> 02:39:12.010

<v Speaker 1>chorus cobb's last few.</v>

3576
02:39:18.260 --> 02:39:19.093
<v Speaker 1>I know he fought Benson Henderson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He beat Benson Henderson up when Benson </v>

3577
02:39:21.301 --> 02:39:22.290
<v Speaker 1>came over to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3578
02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:25.380
<v Speaker 1>to tour and he fought as well to wait </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first time.</v>

3579
02:39:25.710 --> 02:39:28.890
<v Speaker 1>And then a Benson just fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got it.</v>

3580
02:39:33.390 --> 02:39:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

3581
02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:34.560
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

3582
02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Why does it say Douglas Lema twice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas.</v>

3583
02:39:36.231 --> 02:39:38.450
<v Speaker 1>He was the opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's is this course cough?</v>

3584
02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lost a Doug Islam at twice.</v>

3585
02:39:40.710 --> 02:39:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Are you one the first one lost the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second one.</v>

3586
02:39:42.781 --> 02:39:45.240
<v Speaker 1>The first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause Cor de Lima had a fucked up knee.</v>

3587
02:39:45.241 --> 02:39:46.074
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd beat Benson and then Lima </v>

3588
02:39:47.710 --> 02:39:50.460
<v Speaker 1>just crushed him in the rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which fight am I thinking of?</v>

3589
02:39:50.461 --> 02:39:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3590
02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:52.410
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe,</v>

3591
02:39:52.411 --> 02:39:53.244
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember which side it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Benson Henderson one was a big </v>

3592
02:39:55.471 --> 02:39:57.030
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it was a decision,</v>

3593
02:39:57.060 --> 02:39:59.400
<v Speaker 1>you could tell the difference in size is</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty significant.</v>

3594
02:39:59.401 --> 02:40:00.234
<v Speaker 1>But then when Lima fought Korotkov,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see Lima looked way bigger </v>

3595
02:40:04.561 --> 02:40:06.210
<v Speaker 1>than Korotkoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

3596
02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:07.980
<v Speaker 1>and they've got Paul Daley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3597
02:40:07.981 --> 02:40:09.310
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Lima just,</v>

3598
02:40:09.470 --> 02:40:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting all confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lima beat Paul Daley,</v>

3599
02:40:12.180 --> 02:40:14.070
<v Speaker 1>who's super legit and he beat him</v>

3600
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:17.430
<v Speaker 5>by decision and then just knocked out </v>
<v Speaker 5>Korskoff I,</v>

3601
02:40:17.460 --> 02:40:18.293
<v Speaker 5>for some reason I thought Lima are </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought daily had fought Korskoff I </v>

3602
02:40:21.541 --> 02:40:24.420
<v Speaker 5>fucked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But dailies Super Legit,</v>

3603
02:40:24.450 --> 02:40:26.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dailies a scary fucking striker.</v>

3604
02:40:26.370 --> 02:40:29.610
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for Lima to beat him and to be Benson</v>

3605
02:40:29.610 --> 02:40:30.443
<v Speaker 5>Henderson who's relatively undersized </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the division and then to knock out </v>

3606
02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:35.700
<v Speaker 5>Korotkoff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that was stunning shit.</v>

3607
02:40:35.701 --> 02:40:38.010
<v Speaker 5>I think he's world class.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

3608
02:40:38.190 --> 02:40:39.023
<v Speaker 5>meanwhile that guy was ragdoll by Ben </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] who is the one FC champ </v>

3609
02:40:41.700 --> 02:40:42.533
<v Speaker 5>ragdolled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Both of them were Korotkoff cough and </v>

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3615
02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:56.600

<v Speaker 5>Put Up Lima's record again cause uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>2012.</v>

3617
02:41:03.481 --> 02:41:05.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See Lima's had some,</v>

3618
02:41:05.101 --> 02:41:07.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some serious injuries he's at.</v>

3619
02:41:07.551 --> 02:41:10.020
<v Speaker 5>He had serious knee surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

3620
02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:11.340
<v Speaker 5>that was quite a few years ago.</v>

3621
02:41:11.340 --> 02:41:13.890
<v Speaker 5>But then ask her and did that to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>he's done that to a lot of dudes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He gets a of those guys and just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they look like world beaters until he </v>

<v Speaker 5>gets a hold of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get two drags them lyman.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They can't get up.</v>

3629
02:41:29.660 --> 02:41:32.400
<v Speaker 5>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's so relaxed.</v>

3630
02:41:32.401 --> 02:41:35.100
<v Speaker 5>When I saw him do that to somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like riding.</v>

3631
02:41:35.101 --> 02:41:37.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm like a bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like waving to the crowd.</v>

<v Speaker 5>People are booing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't care.</v>

3633
02:41:39.660 --> 02:41:41.130
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

3634
02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:42.013
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3635
02:41:42.150 --> 02:41:46.590
<v Speaker 5>it's one of my most a perplexing puzzles</v>
<v Speaker 5>in mma,</v>

3636
02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:50.850
<v Speaker 5>but he fought when he fought in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3637
02:41:51.060 --> 02:41:54.030
<v Speaker 5>Bella tour when Jay Hiran went over </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

3638
02:41:54.031 --> 02:41:56.880
<v Speaker 5>Jay Heran gave him a hell of a fight and</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jay Heron,</v>

3639
02:41:56.910 --> 02:42:01.170
<v Speaker 5>who was a very good fighter who didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>do so good in the UFC,</v>

3640
02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:06.180
<v Speaker 5>but it was really talented and then went</v>
<v Speaker 5>over and had this fight with a acronym.</v>

3641
02:42:06.250 --> 02:42:07.260
<v Speaker 5>Beltour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3642
02:42:07.270 --> 02:42:08.670
<v Speaker 5>Jay Heran was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3643
02:42:09.150 --> 02:42:11.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a good wrestler with a little bit better</v>

3644
02:42:11.971 --> 02:42:15.860
<v Speaker 5>crisper striking than aspirin and magic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Keep it on the feed lot and ask her,</v>

3645
02:42:15.861 --> 02:42:16.694
<v Speaker 5>had a real problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was one of those things where I </v>

3646
02:42:18.241 --> 02:42:18.661
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3647
02:42:18.661 --> 02:42:21.270
<v Speaker 5>I want to see him against world class </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighters,</v>

3648
02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:23.930
<v Speaker 5>know how to stop that take down against </v>
<v Speaker 5>a real good wrestler.</v>

3649
02:42:23.931 --> 02:42:25.890
<v Speaker 5>And those that have stuff to take down </v>
<v Speaker 5>who's his size?</v>

3650
02:42:26.670 --> 02:42:28.250
<v Speaker 5>But Michael Chandler just beat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3651
02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:29.880
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Benson Henderson too.</v>

3652
02:42:30.590 --> 02:42:32.400
<v Speaker 5>They've got real talent over there now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no doubt.</v>

3653
02:42:32.610 --> 02:42:34.590
<v Speaker 5>But it's still one of those things where</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody watches it.</v>

3654
02:42:34.650 --> 02:42:35.483
<v Speaker 5>It's like you look at the ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like they're lucky they get a few </v>

3655
02:42:38.010 --> 02:42:40.740
<v Speaker 5>hundred thousand well it's the human,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the human drama that people love,</v>

3656
02:42:40.770 --> 02:42:42.570
<v Speaker 5>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the bigger that personality,</v>

3657
02:42:42.571 --> 02:42:45.300
<v Speaker 5>the more it's a celebrity of the more </v>
<v Speaker 5>interested you are in the fight.</v>

3658
02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:46.193
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you get to understand this </v>

3659
02:42:47.791 --> 02:42:48.624
<v Speaker 5>character that conor mcgregor is and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's part of the compelling nature of </v>

3660
02:42:51.661 --> 02:42:52.494
<v Speaker 5>watching the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the personality people want to </v>

3661
02:42:54.781 --> 02:42:56.280
<v Speaker 5>identify with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like some,</v>

3662
02:42:56.490 --> 02:43:00.000
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the difference between a </v>
<v Speaker 5>good epic movie and a Shitty epic movie,</v>

3663
02:43:00.090 --> 02:43:00.923
<v Speaker 5>like a good epic movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You Fall in love with the characters </v>

3664
02:43:03.421 --> 02:43:06.870
<v Speaker 5>before the fucked up stuff happens that </v>
<v Speaker 5>propels them on their hero's journey.</v>

3665
02:43:07.410 --> 02:43:08.243
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't just go straight out of the </v>

3666
02:43:08.881 --> 02:43:11.980
<v Speaker 5>gate and show that that whole backstory </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen and then</v>

3667
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:15.610
<v Speaker 1>he's all of a sudden kicking ass like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be emotionally invested in.</v>

3668
02:43:15.611 --> 02:43:16.444
<v Speaker 1>Then every time they're swinging know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swinging a sword or every time you're </v>

3669
02:43:19.481 --> 02:43:22.880
<v Speaker 1>watching them punch and take down your </v>
<v Speaker 1>way more invested.</v>

3670
02:43:22.890 --> 02:43:23.723
<v Speaker 1>And I think boxing did that with 24 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven the UFC has done that with all of </v>

3671
02:43:26.411 --> 02:43:27.244
<v Speaker 1>their embedded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's just something that </v>

3672
02:43:29.170 --> 02:43:30.003
<v Speaker 1>they do better than anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get you emotionally invested into </v>

3673
02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:37.000
<v Speaker 1>the fighter and then when you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that's when,</v>

3674
02:43:37.060 --> 02:43:40.780
<v Speaker 1>that's when you really want to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also those epic personalities,</v>

3675
02:43:40.781 --> 02:43:41.614
<v Speaker 1>those mega personalities that come </v>
<v Speaker 1>around around every few generations or </v>

3676
02:43:45.191 --> 02:43:47.110
<v Speaker 1>once a generation or a couple of times a</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>

3677
02:43:47.111 --> 02:43:49.830
<v Speaker 1>I should probably say like the Tyson's </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the sugar ray Leonard.</v>

3678
02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:52.330
<v Speaker 1>So the people that people were just so </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelled to watch,</v>

3679
02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:54.310
<v Speaker 1>and connor is just one of those people.</v>

3680
02:43:54.310 --> 02:43:56.620
<v Speaker 1>If he was inboxing and having the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of success,</v>

3681
02:43:56.770 --> 02:43:57.603
<v Speaker 1>he'll be just as big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be gigantic if triple g had his </v>

3682
02:44:00.281 --> 02:44:02.710
<v Speaker 1>personality and my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

3683
02:44:03.340 --> 02:44:04.173
<v Speaker 1>I mean Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But triple g's not doing things the way </v>

3684
02:44:07.571 --> 02:44:08.404
<v Speaker 1>connor's doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even close because connor has those </v>

3685
02:44:10.781 --> 02:44:13.300
<v Speaker 1>little gloves on and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting mma,</v>

3686
02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:16.960
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's landing these one shots like that.</v>

3687
02:44:16.961 --> 02:44:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Just stunned guys and have them rocked </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's putting them away like he's got</v>

3688
02:44:20.231 --> 02:44:22.450
<v Speaker 1>lead in his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of a different thing.</v>

3689
02:44:22.451 --> 02:44:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Like you see his fight with Josie Aldo </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you very rarely see that happen.</v>

3690
02:44:26.950 --> 02:44:30.250
<v Speaker 1>13 seconds in a world championship </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing match where someone connects with</v>

3691
02:44:30.251 --> 02:44:31.084
<v Speaker 1>one shot flatline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody that's in the realm of MMA </v>

3692
02:44:34.421 --> 02:44:36.970
<v Speaker 1>almost exclusively in early fights like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3693
02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:39.460
<v Speaker 1>It's so rare than in a championship </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

3694
02:44:39.730 --> 02:44:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Someone knocked someone dead in 13 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds,</v>

3695
02:44:42.940 --> 02:44:44.770
<v Speaker 1>but in the UFC can happen all the time.</v>

3696
02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:46.113
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just fucking happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot less armor on that button </v>

3697
02:44:50.420 --> 02:44:52.390
<v Speaker 1>on the lights out button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3698
02:44:52.391 --> 02:44:54.700
<v Speaker 1>less padding in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot harder to defend to.</v>

3699
02:44:54.701 --> 02:44:56.380
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to defend with those big </v>
<v Speaker 1>gloves.</v>

3700
02:44:56.460 --> 02:44:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much going on with big gloves</v>

3701
02:44:58.631 --> 02:44:59.464
<v Speaker 1>versus small gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see guys that have devoted their </v>

3702
02:45:01.271 --> 02:45:02.104
<v Speaker 1>whole life to big glove defense and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come in in the small gloves just </v>

3703
02:45:05.021 --> 02:45:08.020
<v Speaker 1>don't offer the same sort of protection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even look at Nicky Hoskins,</v>

3704
02:45:08.021 --> 02:45:08.854
<v Speaker 1>main defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets in that kind of turtle posts </v>

3705
02:45:11.180 --> 02:45:13.180
<v Speaker 1>where he pretty much is covering </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

3706
02:45:13.181 --> 02:45:14.830
<v Speaker 1>That's super important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3707
02:45:14.831 --> 02:45:17.290
<v Speaker 1>in his head with his gloves and forearms</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Yup.</v>

3708
02:45:17.380 --> 02:45:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Can't do that with a little gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No you can't.</v>

3709
02:45:20.110 --> 02:45:20.943
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the cool things about </v>

3710
02:45:22.061 --> 02:45:25.150
<v Speaker 1>watching a guy like holt skins that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do that like with the big gloves,</v>

3711
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.841
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

3712
02:45:25.841 --> 02:45:26.674
<v Speaker 1>we can do here.</v>

3713
02:45:26.810 --> 02:45:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't hit that guy.</v>

3714
02:45:28.780 --> 02:45:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>

3715
02:45:29.740 --> 02:45:31.450
<v Speaker 1>did you ever see his fight with Raymond </v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniels?</v>

3716
02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Two fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walks him down,</v>

3717
02:45:33.731 --> 02:45:35.050
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just beats the legs up,</v>

3718
02:45:35.051 --> 02:45:37.080
<v Speaker 1>walks him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starts beating the fuck out of him.</v>

3719
02:45:37.290 --> 02:45:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just absorbs those shots.</v>

3720
02:45:38.921 --> 02:45:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Keeps Chop Chop chopping away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad mother fucker,</v>

3721
02:45:42.191 --> 02:45:44.530
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of those guys now.</v>

3722
02:45:44.980 --> 02:45:45.813
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3723
02:45:46.570 --> 02:45:49.900
<v Speaker 1>I just hope that it gets the attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it deserves because these guys are,</v>

3724
02:45:49.980 --> 02:45:50.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really risking their health in </v>

3725
02:45:52.221 --> 02:45:53.830
<v Speaker 1>such a dramatic way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3726
02:45:53.860 --> 02:45:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Whitney's working for glory now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw Holla at miss two jets.</v>

3727
02:45:58.750 --> 02:46:02.410
<v Speaker 1>I saw that this is going to Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were in,</v>

3728
02:46:02.411 --> 02:46:03.244
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in here and Joe Schilling and </v>

3729
02:46:04.841 --> 02:46:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Eve Edwards and I did a glory fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>companion and we're like,</v>

3730
02:46:07.870 --> 02:46:08.703
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look away.</v>

3731
02:46:09.430 --> 02:46:10.010
<v Speaker 1>And if</v>

3732
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:11.390
<v Speaker 2>your mother fuckers does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she like it.</v>

3733
02:46:11.890 --> 02:46:14.420
<v Speaker 2>She likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

3734
02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:16.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just I,</v>

3735
02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:20.630
<v Speaker 2>for some reason I don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason is,</v>

3736
02:46:20.631 --> 02:46:25.160
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason it's just never </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely like took root in America.</v>

3737
02:46:25.340 --> 02:46:27.770
<v Speaker 2>But it's not because of the talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

3738
02:46:27.771 --> 02:46:29.450
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to tell the stories,</v>

3739
02:46:29.540 --> 02:46:30.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what people want.</v>

3740
02:46:31.670 --> 02:46:35.950
<v Speaker 2>You need to have invest way more in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the pre fight,</v>

3741
02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:37.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>video crew.</v>

3742
02:46:37.041 --> 02:46:40.410
<v Speaker 2>It's putting out these videos or get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality TV show.</v>

3743
02:46:40.411 --> 02:46:42.410
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's a genius thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC did.</v>

3744
02:46:42.411 --> 02:46:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're exposing people to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality of these characters and then</v>

3745
02:46:46.341 --> 02:46:47.780
<v Speaker 2>when you watch him fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you care.</v>

3746
02:46:48.350 --> 02:46:50.390
<v Speaker 2>That's the fucking missing piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

3747
02:46:50.570 --> 02:46:51.403
<v Speaker 2>I think they're always looking at how </v>
<v Speaker 2>can we improve the actual sport you got </v>

3748
02:46:54.141 --> 02:46:55.550
<v Speaker 2>to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3749
02:46:55.580 --> 02:46:58.340
<v Speaker 2>the people's access inside these </v>
<v Speaker 2>combatants.</v>

3750
02:46:58.340 --> 02:47:00.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the key.</v>

3751
02:47:00.950 --> 02:47:01.641
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another thing,</v>

3752
02:47:01.641 --> 02:47:02.474
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem like there's a number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a venue that is anything even </v>

3753
02:47:07.671 --> 02:47:08.504
<v Speaker 2>remotely like the venues that used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist just like 10 years ago as far as </v>

3754
02:47:11.751 --> 02:47:12.584
<v Speaker 2>like putting a fight on showtime or </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting a fight on hbo or putting a </v>

3755
02:47:15.051 --> 02:47:15.884
<v Speaker 2>fight on NBC seems like 10 20 years ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could've put Moitai on NBC at nine </v>

3756
02:47:21.141 --> 02:47:24.380
<v Speaker 2>o'clock at night at some crazy Moitai </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and people would have got hooked.</v>

3757
02:47:24.381 --> 02:47:24.861
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

3758
02:47:24.861 --> 02:47:25.694
<v Speaker 2>this is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now it seems like there's so many </v>

3759
02:47:28.101 --> 02:47:28.934
<v Speaker 2>options for entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really difficult to like lock in a </v>

3760
02:47:32.541 --> 02:47:33.374
<v Speaker 2>substantial group of people just by </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting something on a certain time at </v>

3761
02:47:35.961 --> 02:47:37.430
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they have so many choices.</v>

3762
02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:38.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's almost too many choices where </v>

3763
02:47:39.501 --> 02:47:40.334
<v Speaker 2>almost like overrun with possibilities </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stare into the looking glass and get </v>

3764
02:47:43.750 --> 02:47:44.583
<v Speaker 2>chanted.</v>

3765
02:47:44.900 --> 02:47:46.280
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

3766
02:47:46.380 --> 02:47:47.213
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think ultimately that's our </v>

3767
02:47:47.871 --> 02:47:49.080
<v Speaker 2>salvation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3768
02:47:49.081 --> 02:47:49.914
<v Speaker 2>you get all of the choices and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can really decide what you </v>

3769
02:47:53.031 --> 02:47:53.990
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3770
02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:57.730
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to be robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I told him.</v>

3771
02:47:57.920 --> 02:47:59.570
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just robots were that.</v>

3772
02:47:59.571 --> 02:48:00.404
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the cool part about </v>

3773
02:48:01.821 --> 02:48:05.300
<v Speaker 2>westworld is it's showing that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>where his robot,</v>

3774
02:48:05.301 --> 02:48:07.220
<v Speaker 2>whereas consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at what level,</v>

3775
02:48:07.490 --> 02:48:09.800
<v Speaker 2>and I think we're just a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated version of that.</v>

3776
02:48:09.950 --> 02:48:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3777
02:48:10.510 --> 02:48:12.560
<v Speaker 2>don't spoiler alert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen the last episode.</v>

3778
02:48:12.660 --> 02:48:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen the last ones next week.</v>

3779
02:48:14.500 --> 02:48:16.640
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen all of them up till now.</v>

3780
02:48:16.641 --> 02:48:18.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm caught up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people listening aren't,</v>

3781
02:48:19.210 --> 02:48:20.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3782
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:21.703
<v Speaker 2>I think before that ever happens before </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a place where you can go and </v>

3783
02:48:23.991 --> 02:48:26.660
<v Speaker 2>interact with robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be one.</v>

3784
02:48:26.810 --> 02:48:27.643
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to be way more likely</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to take people that </v>

3785
02:48:30.591 --> 02:48:32.960
<v Speaker 2>have been injured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like soldiers that have lost a limb in a</v>

3786
02:48:32.961 --> 02:48:33.794
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna replace it with better </v>

3787
02:48:34.431 --> 02:48:37.730
<v Speaker 2>limbs than the first person is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>offer to get their limbs cut off.</v>

3788
02:48:37.910 --> 02:48:38.743
<v Speaker 2>It's probably gonna be someone with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease where the limbs don't work so </v>

3789
02:48:40.371 --> 02:48:41.204
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get them cut off and then they win </v>

3790
02:48:42.201 --> 02:48:43.034
<v Speaker 2>the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just start jumping over buildings and </v>

3791
02:48:44.421 --> 02:48:45.290
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>

3792
02:48:45.291 --> 02:48:46.820
<v Speaker 2>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't have these regular legs?</v>

3793
02:48:47.360 --> 02:48:48.193
<v Speaker 2>And then one day it's going to get to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where you can take your whole </v>

3794
02:48:49.881 --> 02:48:50.714
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take that brain sticking into fuck </v>

3795
02:48:52.450 --> 02:48:55.250
<v Speaker 2>another body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not necessarily the brain.</v>

3796
02:48:55.251 --> 02:48:58.250
<v Speaker 2>I think it's whatever that that thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we call consciousness,</v>

3797
02:48:58.251 --> 02:49:01.850
<v Speaker 2>maybe that originates from the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's something something separate,</v>

3798
02:49:01.851 --> 02:49:02.684
<v Speaker 2>but the transfer of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of those archetipal stories </v>

3799
02:49:05.391 --> 02:49:06.224
<v Speaker 2>like a religious story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The the shape shifter like you find in </v>

3800
02:49:08.431 --> 02:49:09.264
<v Speaker 2>so many cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who can transfer their </v>

3801
02:49:11.041 --> 02:49:11.874
<v Speaker 2>consciousness to another vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's definitely going to </v>

3802
02:49:14.731 --> 02:49:15.564
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're going to be able to transfer </v>

3803
02:49:16.801 --> 02:49:21.330
<v Speaker 2>our consciousness into other things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can hold that level of complexity.</v>

3804
02:49:21.660 --> 02:49:22.493
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as long as it can hold that level </v>

3805
02:49:23.311 --> 02:49:24.144
<v Speaker 2>of complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think trying to transfer our </v>

3806
02:49:25.351 --> 02:49:28.290
<v Speaker 2>consciousness into a stinkbug would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>really challenging.</v>

3807
02:49:28.291 --> 02:49:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Obviously the brain and how it worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too,</v>

3808
02:49:30.690 --> 02:49:33.030
<v Speaker 2>it's putting something that's too big </v>
<v Speaker 2>and something too little,</v>

3809
02:49:33.031 --> 02:49:35.610
<v Speaker 2>but if something is of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3810
02:49:35.670 --> 02:49:36.503
<v Speaker 2>similar complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we could transfer our </v>

3811
02:49:37.981 --> 02:49:38.814
<v Speaker 2>consciousness into there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just got to figure out what </v>

3812
02:49:40.081 --> 02:49:41.940
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you know,</v>

3813
02:49:41.941 --> 02:49:42.774
<v Speaker 2>how we measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere in between the spaces of </v>

3814
02:49:45.090 --> 02:49:47.250
<v Speaker 2>quantum physics or maybe that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>frontier.</v>

3815
02:49:47.251 --> 02:49:48.084
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how we transfer that I think will </v>

3816
02:49:50.761 --> 02:49:51.594
<v Speaker 2>ultimately figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we know it and I think </v>

3817
02:49:53.131 --> 02:49:55.050
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's in all these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to work.</v>

3818
02:49:55.760 --> 02:49:56.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have conversations with</v>

3819
02:49:56.911 --> 02:49:57.571
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

3820
02:49:57.571 --> 02:49:58.590
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it.</v>

3821
02:49:58.591 --> 02:50:00.240
<v Speaker 2>We made a copy of your brain so it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work.</v>

3822
02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:01.860
<v Speaker 2>We just put you back in your own body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3823
02:50:01.861 --> 02:50:02.581
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh cool,</v>

3824
02:50:02.581 --> 02:50:03.840
<v Speaker 2>you made a coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3825
02:50:03.860 --> 02:50:07.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's copy from November 21st,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2016 do not worry.</v>

3826
02:50:07.780 --> 02:50:08.613
<v Speaker 2>Everything from here back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to remember anything </v>

3827
02:50:09.991 --> 02:50:11.220
<v Speaker 2>from today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's no big deal,</v>

3828
02:50:11.221 --> 02:50:12.450
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going gonna lose a couple of days</v>

3829
02:50:12.451 --> 02:50:16.920
<v Speaker 2>of shit going on and you catch up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get on your twitter or the top trending.</v>

3830
02:50:16.940 --> 02:50:17.773
<v Speaker 2>Just objects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just rides and it goes out a body for a </v>

3831
02:50:19.561 --> 02:50:20.700
<v Speaker 2>little while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stays current,</v>

3832
02:50:20.701 --> 02:50:22.350
<v Speaker 2>and then just drops back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3833
02:50:22.351 --> 02:50:26.010
<v Speaker 2>now you're talking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why he of thing to the next</v>

3834
02:50:26.011 --> 02:50:26.844
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like we're going to come to </v>

3835
02:50:30.421 --> 02:50:35.421
<v Speaker 2>a point where we figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>express ourselves outside on language.</v>

3836
02:50:35.850 --> 02:50:38.490
<v Speaker 2>This is what I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that the intention,</v>

3837
02:50:38.491 --> 02:50:41.400
<v Speaker 2>like pure intention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be able to broadcast that</v>

3838
02:50:41.610 --> 02:50:44.430
<v Speaker 2>through some form of third party </v>
<v Speaker 2>software,</v>

3839
02:50:44.431 --> 02:50:46.050
<v Speaker 2>hardware solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

3840
02:50:46.290 --> 02:50:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Like there'll be able to figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual intention of a thought is and</v>

3841
02:50:51.631 --> 02:50:54.000
<v Speaker 2>transmit that and so instead of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence,</v>

3842
02:50:54.001 --> 02:50:54.834
<v Speaker 2>it will be a series of thoughts that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can transfer the intention where you </v>

3843
02:50:58.291 --> 02:50:59.124
<v Speaker 2>know it without language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to have a comprehension </v>

3844
02:51:02.371 --> 02:51:03.204
<v Speaker 2>of German to be able to communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person from Germany because you'll be </v>

3845
02:51:05.431 --> 02:51:06.264
<v Speaker 2>able to see whatever they're thinking in</v>
<v Speaker 2>pure intent or feel it or know it or </v>

3846
02:51:11.161 --> 02:51:11.994
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's so much closer to truth than </v>

3847
02:51:14.011 --> 02:51:16.050
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is always just an approximation.</v>

3848
02:51:16.100 --> 02:51:16.933
<v Speaker 2>It's just a symbol for an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you could express in pure </v>

3849
02:51:19.381 --> 02:51:22.710
<v Speaker 2>intent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know like just the feeling of it and</v>

3850
02:51:22.711 --> 02:51:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I think that's also what you experienced</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes in in the psychedelic state.</v>

3851
02:51:26.491 --> 02:51:30.810
<v Speaker 2>You feel what you would think is God and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't fucking describe it.</v>

3852
02:51:30.870 --> 02:51:31.703
<v Speaker 2>All of the words fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing that makes sense when you're </v>

3853
02:51:33.961 --> 02:51:35.850
<v Speaker 2>actually talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you feel it.</v>

3854
02:51:35.851 --> 02:51:36.684
<v Speaker 2>And the intent of that thing is there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you just approximate it and </v>

3855
02:51:39.361 --> 02:51:42.270
<v Speaker 2>approximate it until it's almost gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

3856
02:51:42.300 --> 02:51:45.720
<v Speaker 2>And it is ridiculous because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>put that into words,</v>

3857
02:51:45.750 --> 02:51:46.583
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you feel that and you only way you </v>

3858
02:51:49.141 --> 02:51:51.750
<v Speaker 2>really have a reference if you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced it as well.</v>

3859
02:51:51.900 --> 02:51:52.733
<v Speaker 2>Like you're saying this and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm listening to you say this and I </v>

3860
02:51:54.871 --> 02:51:56.700
<v Speaker 2>agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm like,</v>

3861
02:51:56.701 --> 02:51:57.534
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would I describe it any differently </v>

3862
02:51:58.621 --> 02:51:59.431
<v Speaker 2>to somebody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3863
02:51:59.431 --> 02:52:01.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see what we got here for tools.</v>

3864
02:52:02.070 --> 02:52:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't exist.</v>

3865
02:52:03.540 --> 02:52:07.780
<v Speaker 2>There's no tools in the toolbox that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allow you to explain like a really heavy</v>

3866
02:52:07.781 --> 02:52:11.170
<v Speaker 2>duty breakthrough dmt trip did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't exist.</v>

3867
02:52:11.230 --> 02:52:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Like you can try to approximate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you sang it.</v>

3868
02:52:13.690 --> 02:52:14.523
<v Speaker 2>I register it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's only because I have what I </v>

3869
02:52:16.841 --> 02:52:19.600
<v Speaker 2>believe to be a similar experience to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you've experienced.</v>

3870
02:52:19.660 --> 02:52:21.370
<v Speaker 2>And even that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just guesswork.</v>

3871
02:52:21.520 --> 02:52:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm assuming you're explaining,</v>

3872
02:52:23.230 --> 02:52:25.600
<v Speaker 2>you're explaining to me what went down </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you had it.</v>

3873
02:52:25.601 --> 02:52:26.434
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that sounds a lot like how I would </v>

3874
02:52:28.090 --> 02:52:33.090
<v Speaker 2>clumsily trying to explain my experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know and you don't know.</v>

3875
02:52:33.890 --> 02:52:36.160
<v Speaker 2>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we should go out and look</v>

3876
02:52:36.161 --> 02:52:37.300
<v Speaker 2>for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3877
02:52:37.390 --> 02:52:39.010
<v Speaker 2>feel these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see these things,</v>

3878
02:52:39.011 --> 02:52:41.360
<v Speaker 2>experience these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you see burning man,</v>

3879
02:52:41.770 --> 02:52:44.170
<v Speaker 2>when you go to a place like burning man </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see what's possible,</v>

3880
02:52:44.290 --> 02:52:47.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously I haven't been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've been a few times when you see</v>

3881
02:52:47.441 --> 02:52:48.274
<v Speaker 2>what's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When these fucking freaks I'll get </v>

3882
02:52:49.511 --> 02:52:51.460
<v Speaker 2>together and rewrite the rules and go </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

3883
02:52:51.820 --> 02:52:52.930
<v Speaker 2>It gives you a lot of hope.</v>

3884
02:52:53.310 --> 02:52:54.143
<v Speaker 2>It really does because it makes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize like these are a lot of people </v>

3885
02:52:56.441 --> 02:52:57.274
<v Speaker 2>with normal people around us and yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're choosing in this one moment to </v>

3886
02:53:00.941 --> 02:53:05.860
<v Speaker 2>behave in this stark contrast to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday culture and society.</v>

3887
02:53:05.861 --> 02:53:06.694
<v Speaker 2>But there's no litter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are friendly with each other to </v>

3888
02:53:08.611 --> 02:53:09.444
<v Speaker 2>give it away food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're only doing it for short </v>

3889
02:53:11.681 --> 02:53:12.910
<v Speaker 2>bursts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3890
02:53:12.911 --> 02:53:15.760
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it for a week at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once a year,</v>

3891
02:53:16.480 --> 02:53:18.880
<v Speaker 2>but they're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still doing it.</v>

3892
02:53:18.881 --> 02:53:22.360
<v Speaker 2>And they didn't do it 30 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't do it 50 years ago.</v>

3893
02:53:22.660 --> 02:53:25.450
<v Speaker 2>They're doing it now and they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in one spot,</v>

3894
02:53:26.050 --> 02:53:26.883
<v Speaker 2>but we're talking about it and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were starting to get together and they </v>

3895
02:53:29.661 --> 02:53:30.071
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's,</v>

3896
02:53:30.071 --> 02:53:32.440
<v Speaker 2>we could do this more often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we can do something similar to this</v>

3897
02:53:32.441 --> 02:53:33.274
<v Speaker 2>more often proves the concept because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>changes your view of how an interaction </v>

3898
02:53:37.841 --> 02:53:38.840
<v Speaker 2>with a stranger could be.</v>

3899
02:53:38.840 --> 02:53:42.300
<v Speaker 2>It not somebody who's trying to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>something from you and fuck you up,</v>

3900
02:53:42.310 --> 02:53:43.510
<v Speaker 2>fuck up your energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3901
02:53:43.511 --> 02:53:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Like you're all in it together in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird way.</v>

3902
02:53:46.121 --> 02:53:47.710
<v Speaker 2>And obviously their shit heads at </v>
<v Speaker 2>burning man too.</v>

3903
02:53:47.711 --> 02:53:51.790
<v Speaker 2>But you'd get the overwhelming consensus</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're all in it together.</v>

3904
02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:53.740
<v Speaker 2>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a cool,</v>

3905
02:53:53.770 --> 02:53:57.550
<v Speaker 2>cool feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just transcends these kind of very solid</v>

3906
02:53:57.551 --> 02:53:58.280
<v Speaker 2>cystic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

3907
02:53:58.280 --> 02:53:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would even for myself,</v>

3908
02:53:59.650 --> 02:54:02.350
<v Speaker 2>these are my things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my fortress that I build and you</v>

3909
02:54:02.351 --> 02:54:05.950
<v Speaker 2>just collapse all that and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and surrender to a much,</v>

3910
02:54:05.951 --> 02:54:08.140
<v Speaker 2>much happier state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of the magic.</v>

3911
02:54:08.230 --> 02:54:09.063
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that one of the more genuine </v>

3912
02:54:09.971 --> 02:54:10.804
<v Speaker 2>problems with any sort of egalitarian or</v>
<v Speaker 2>more altruistic vision is that people </v>

3913
02:54:18.041 --> 02:54:19.820
<v Speaker 2>are not going to reciprocate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3914
02:54:19.870 --> 02:54:20.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you could find a like minded </v>

3915
02:54:21.911 --> 02:54:22.744
<v Speaker 2>group of people where instead of the mob</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentality going fucking crazy and </v>

3916
02:54:25.871 --> 02:54:28.060
<v Speaker 2>grabbing swords and chopping each shop </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other out,</v>

3917
02:54:28.061 --> 02:54:30.250
<v Speaker 2>there's the mob mentality of peace and </v>
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>

3918
02:54:30.250 --> 02:54:34.030
<v Speaker 2>We're all just sort of everybody around </v>
<v Speaker 2>you sort of adopted this thing.</v>

3919
02:54:34.031 --> 02:54:34.864
<v Speaker 2>You know it really radical way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in fucking goggles and riding </v>

3920
02:54:37.451 --> 02:54:40.780
<v Speaker 2>bikes everywhere and everything's lit up</v>
<v Speaker 2>a solar power and you're like,</v>

3921
02:54:40.781 --> 02:54:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are going deep with this.</v>

3922
02:54:42.371 --> 02:54:44.710
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody's embraced this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there,</v>

3923
02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:45.553
<v Speaker 2>so all in every fucking chip is on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>table when you're out there that it </v>

3924
02:54:49.091 --> 02:54:49.924
<v Speaker 2>reinforces this different and very </v>
<v Speaker 2>peculiar sort of mob mentality that's </v>

3925
02:54:54.731 --> 02:54:55.890
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic trip and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3926
02:54:55.891 --> 02:54:57.460
<v Speaker 2>and happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3927
02:54:57.461 --> 02:54:58.294
<v Speaker 2>and that that's possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like while we're watching mass rape in </v>

3928
02:55:01.871 --> 02:55:02.704
<v Speaker 2>India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear about these horrible instances </v>

3929
02:55:03.921 --> 02:55:04.754
<v Speaker 2>where these men rape women on trains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck is going on over </v>

3930
02:55:08.271 --> 02:55:09.860
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While that's happening,</v>

3931
02:55:10.770 --> 02:55:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Bernie man's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3932
02:55:11.901 --> 02:55:12.734
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another sort of mob </v>

3933
02:55:14.631 --> 02:55:19.631
<v Speaker 2>consciousness that can erupt when it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered carefully applied ethically,</v>

3934
02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:25.520
<v Speaker 2>morally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitively with an open heart.</v>

3935
02:55:25.860 --> 02:55:28.490
<v Speaker 2>Like that can be done to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of different states.</v>

3936
02:55:28.491 --> 02:55:30.380
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you apply to who,</v>

3937
02:55:30.390 --> 02:55:31.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a human goes into an environment with </v>

3938
02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:36.440
<v Speaker 2>love and radical acceptance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True in in the truest sense.</v>

3939
02:55:36.680 --> 02:55:39.620
<v Speaker 2>You're going to more adapt to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you get in these systems of fear</v>

3940
02:55:39.621 --> 02:55:40.880
<v Speaker 2>and control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3941
02:55:40.881 --> 02:55:44.150
<v Speaker 2>you're going to adapt to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think anybody that we encounter,</v>

3942
02:55:44.151 --> 02:55:47.330
<v Speaker 2>we have that choice of what we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to give back to them and turn that tide.</v>

3943
02:55:47.331 --> 02:55:50.750
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it won't be reciprocated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can also stop the,</v>

3944
02:55:51.020 --> 02:55:53.450
<v Speaker 2>it can stop that trend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if someone really,</v>

3945
02:55:53.620 --> 02:55:55.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they do something fucked up,</v>

3946
02:55:55.430 --> 02:55:57.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't prevent it and you have to</v>

3947
02:55:57.201 --> 02:55:59.540
<v Speaker 2>accept it and move on except that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>

3948
02:55:59.541 --> 02:56:00.374
<v Speaker 2>show that person love and not this </v>
<v Speaker 2>desire for justice and revenge and </v>

3949
02:56:03.891 --> 02:56:05.600
<v Speaker 2>you'll start to switch the pattern.</v>

3950
02:56:05.730 --> 02:56:06.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>

3951
02:56:06.500 --> 02:56:08.270
<v Speaker 2>that's the only thing that ends the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle.</v>

3952
02:56:08.271 --> 02:56:11.060
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that ends the cycle </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately as love,</v>

3953
02:56:11.061 --> 02:56:12.560
<v Speaker 2>like violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3954
02:56:12.561 --> 02:56:15.260
<v Speaker 2>you get something violent to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you do something violent to them,</v>

3955
02:56:15.261 --> 02:56:16.094
<v Speaker 2>then you do something violent to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it continues to go until one person </v>

3956
02:56:18.711 --> 02:56:20.300
<v Speaker 2>just holds like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3957
02:56:20.301 --> 02:56:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I see your pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see where you're coming from.</v>

3958
02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:24.260
<v Speaker 2>I see you as me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3959
02:56:24.261 --> 02:56:25.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry you've had been driven to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

3960
02:56:25.971 --> 02:56:26.804
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to love you no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all the sudden that person's </v>

3961
02:56:28.970 --> 02:56:30.200
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

3962
02:56:30.590 --> 02:56:34.420
<v Speaker 2>And then it can end that cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's what we gotta do in,</v>

3963
02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:35.273
<v Speaker 2>in society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where we got to do the right and </v>

3964
02:56:36.411 --> 02:56:37.244
<v Speaker 2>the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of continually shooting these </v>

3965
02:56:38.751 --> 02:56:39.584
<v Speaker 2>barbs at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At some point the conscious people have </v>

3966
02:56:41.601 --> 02:56:43.070
<v Speaker 2>to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3967
02:56:43.071 --> 02:56:45.140
<v Speaker 2>whatever you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear you.</v>

3968
02:56:45.170 --> 02:56:48.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's my point of view,</v>

3969
02:56:48.050 --> 02:56:50.180
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to love you as if you were me.</v>

3970
02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:51.313
<v Speaker 2>And then that ultimately ends it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as long as we're just lobbing </v>

3971
02:56:53.870 --> 02:56:56.360
<v Speaker 2>fucking hand grenades at each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what fault?</v>

3972
02:56:56.810 --> 02:56:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like a bunch of hippy bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that trump's gonna make a legal,</v>

3973
02:56:59.121 --> 02:56:59.954
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking he's throwing people in </v>

3974
02:57:01.941 --> 02:57:03.980
<v Speaker 2>jail for burning the flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're taking it old school again,</v>

3975
02:57:03.981 --> 02:57:05.900
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old school,</v>

3976
02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:07.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3977
02:57:07.370 --> 02:57:09.200
<v Speaker 2>the fake Tan that he uses is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3978
02:57:09.230 --> 02:57:10.010
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3979
02:57:10.010 --> 02:57:12.980
<v Speaker 2>he takes a native American graves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3980
02:57:12.981 --> 02:57:13.814
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he takes the soil and that's what they </v>

3981
02:57:15.861 --> 02:57:20.030
<v Speaker 2>use for the fake Tan is the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get it that perfect cue,</v>

3982
02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:22.010
<v Speaker 2>but you can't get it too close to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes,</v>

3983
02:57:22.070 --> 02:57:25.010
<v Speaker 2>hence the raccoon look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it empowers you.</v>

3984
02:57:25.011 --> 02:57:27.260
<v Speaker 2>It gives you energy and such a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>supervillain move.</v>

3985
02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:29.630
<v Speaker 2>He just needs it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Move trump tower,</v>

3986
02:57:30.230 --> 02:57:31.063
<v Speaker 2>inactive volcano,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move trump tower to an Indian burial </v>

3987
02:57:34.401 --> 02:57:35.234
<v Speaker 2>site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a trump tower up right where the </v>

3988
02:57:36.681 --> 02:57:39.750
<v Speaker 2>Dakota pipeline is being built.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One trump tower and just show the,</v>

3989
02:57:39.910 --> 02:57:44.910
<v Speaker 2>or just show redskins games were wearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>a red hat.</v>

3990
02:57:47.180 --> 02:57:49.970
<v Speaker 2>Make America great again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck,</v>

3991
02:57:49.971 --> 02:57:50.900
<v Speaker 2>ma'am?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

3992
02:57:51.110 --> 02:57:53.750
<v Speaker 2>Strange Times Change Times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but beautiful times.</v>

3993
02:57:53.780 --> 02:57:54.613
<v Speaker 2>They're the best times they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the more we realized that the best </v>

3994
02:57:56.571 --> 02:57:58.220
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more we're going to be okay.</v>

3995
02:57:58.221 --> 02:57:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Like right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3996
02:57:59.271 --> 02:58:01.950
<v Speaker 2>It is entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We might get hit</v>

3997
02:58:02.100 --> 02:58:05.310
<v Speaker 5>by an asteroid the size of China.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is entirely possible.</v>

3998
02:58:05.311 --> 02:58:09.630
<v Speaker 5>There are out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's giant chunks of the world rather</v>

3999
02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:13.500
<v Speaker 5>was at one point time hit with another </v>
<v Speaker 5>planet that's established.</v>

4000
02:58:13.650 --> 02:58:14.483
<v Speaker 5>That's what they believe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They believe the moon was created when </v>

4001
02:58:16.021 --> 02:58:16.854
<v Speaker 5>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we nearly collided with another fucking </v>

4002
02:58:19.261 --> 02:58:22.830
<v Speaker 5>planet that did sleek.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not happening right now though,</v>

4003
02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:27.920
<v Speaker 5>so right now it's just be nice to each </v>
<v Speaker 5>other and have some fucking fun.</v>

4004
02:58:29.460 --> 02:58:30.690
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's go champ.</v>

4005
02:58:32.450 --> 02:58:33.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4006
02:58:33.051 --> 02:58:34.970
<v Speaker 2>If we can always figure out shit to </v>
<v Speaker 2>worry about,</v>

4007
02:58:34.971 --> 02:58:37.190
<v Speaker 2>we can figure out all of these things to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress us out.</v>

4008
02:58:37.191 --> 02:58:38.660
<v Speaker 2>It's our job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's our relationship.</v>

4009
02:58:38.661 --> 02:58:41.830
<v Speaker 2>It's the fucking media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he's long as you enjoy the now,</v>

4010
02:58:41.840 --> 02:58:44.630
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to regret it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I go back and talk to my younger self</v>

4011
02:58:44.631 --> 02:58:46.010
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey young Aubrey,</v>

4012
02:58:46.130 --> 02:58:49.610
<v Speaker 2>if I could tell you one fucking thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to stress less like,</v>

4013
02:58:49.611 --> 02:58:51.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about the possibilities,</v>

4014
02:58:51.081 --> 02:58:51.914
<v Speaker 2>but then let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like enjoy your time because all there </v>

4015
02:58:54.141 --> 02:58:57.440
<v Speaker 2>is is the enjoyment of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know all of these goals you have,</v>

4016
02:58:57.441 --> 02:59:00.980
<v Speaker 2>they're all false summits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like enjoy the whole process all the way</v>

4017
02:59:00.981 --> 02:59:01.814
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enjoy to that last moment where the </v>

4018
02:59:03.321 --> 02:59:06.500
<v Speaker 2>fucking Chinese size asteroid smashes </v>
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>

4019
02:59:06.501 --> 02:59:10.040
<v Speaker 2>enjoy up to that last minute and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't have any regrets.</v>

4020
02:59:10.070 --> 02:59:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can prevent it,</v>

4021
02:59:11.420 --> 02:59:12.740
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you can't do anything,</v>

4022
02:59:12.770 --> 02:59:14.330
<v Speaker 2>don't fucking stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Relax.</v>

4023
02:59:14.760 --> 02:59:18.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then even realize that like goals,</v>

4024
02:59:18.600 --> 02:59:19.433
<v Speaker 5>they actually help you be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As weird as it seems like achieving </v>

4025
02:59:21.991 --> 02:59:22.824
<v Speaker 5>goals and going after things and showing</v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself that through discipline and </v>

4026
02:59:26.221 --> 02:59:27.054
<v Speaker 5>focus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can achieve these weird creative </v>

4027
02:59:28.411 --> 02:59:30.780
<v Speaker 5>ventures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take things to new places.</v>

4028
02:59:30.910 --> 02:59:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the going for the competitor.</v>

4029
02:59:32.560 --> 02:59:34.720
<v Speaker 2>It's the going for the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best part.</v>

4030
02:59:34.721 --> 02:59:38.890
<v Speaker 2>It's not the actual achievement of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal makes you feel suddenly different.</v>

4031
02:59:38.891 --> 02:59:42.340
<v Speaker 2>It's that you're striving for making </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress and then you hit it and there's</v>

4032
02:59:42.341 --> 02:59:44.140
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course that satisfaction,</v>

4033
02:59:44.141 --> 02:59:45.990
<v Speaker 2>but then you set another goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4034
02:59:46.030 --> 02:59:46.863
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you set another goal and just </v>

4035
02:59:47.441 --> 02:59:49.330
<v Speaker 2>know that you'll constantly be setting </v>
<v Speaker 2>goals.</v>

4036
02:59:49.331 --> 02:59:52.780
<v Speaker 2>So if at no point you're ever happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're achieving the goal,</v>

4037
02:59:52.781 --> 02:59:55.090
<v Speaker 2>you're only going to be happy if </v>
<v Speaker 2>fractional part of time,</v>

4038
02:59:55.210 --> 02:59:56.043
<v Speaker 2>unless you're with that transformer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch getting his dick sucked over the </v>

4039
02:59:59.201 --> 03:00:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Atlantic elude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You knew too.</v>

4040
03:00:03.790 --> 03:00:04.623
<v Speaker 2>He probably has those cheesy limo lights</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of his jet where they change </v>

4041
03:00:07.781 --> 03:00:09.520
<v Speaker 2>colors all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like purple,</v>

4042
03:00:09.521 --> 03:00:10.810
<v Speaker 2>green,</v>
<v Speaker 2>red,</v>

4043
03:00:10.811 --> 03:00:14.200
<v Speaker 2>yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's in there with a bottle of Stoli</v>

4044
03:00:14.650 --> 03:00:18.610
<v Speaker 2>activate an eagle feather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supervised Agora and Gorge Dick.</v>

4045

<v Speaker 2>has ears are ringing.</v>

4046
03:00:23.380 --> 03:00:25.630
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't breathe through his nose a </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

4047
03:00:27.220 --> 03:00:31.940
<v Speaker 2>He uses coke to open up his nose so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can breathe out of his nose while his</v>

4048
03:00:31.941 --> 03:00:35.440
<v Speaker 2>deck as hard as titanium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything else?</v>

4049
03:00:35.830 --> 03:00:37.230
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shanice for me.</v>

4050

<v Speaker 2>experience or how long would that take?</v>

4057
03:00:51.311 --> 03:00:52.144
<v Speaker 2>let's set this up.</v>

4058
03:00:52.890 --> 03:00:53.250
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4059
03:00:53.250 --> 03:00:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Last time I talked to you after you had </v>
<v Speaker 2>an Iowasca experience,</v>

4060
03:00:56.101 --> 03:00:56.760
<v Speaker 2>you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4062
03:00:58.230 --> 03:00:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4063
03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:00.280
<v Speaker 2>It almost</v>

4064
03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:01.001
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4065
03:01:01.001 --> 03:01:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm good.</v>

4066
03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some little dmt trips here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

4067
03:01:04.661 --> 03:01:08.920
<v Speaker 1>but I think I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing I know you're off to</v>

4068
03:01:08.921 --> 03:01:10.900
<v Speaker 1>the fucking jungle again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go champ.</v>

4069
03:01:12.180 --> 03:01:14.090
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's called change.</v>

4070
03:01:14.820 --> 03:01:15.960
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4071
03:01:16.140 --> 03:01:16.973
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I enjoy is taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who haven't experienced it and </v>

4072
03:01:20.040 --> 03:01:20.873
<v Speaker 4>going there with them going like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no better rite of passage </v>

4073
03:01:23.791 --> 03:01:24.624
<v Speaker 4>bonding experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this time I just brought all of my </v>

4074
03:01:26.131 --> 03:01:29.010
<v Speaker 4>homies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everybody in my inner circle that I</v>

4075
03:01:29.011 --> 03:01:30.840
<v Speaker 4>love that wanting to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4076
03:01:30.841 --> 03:01:32.760
<v Speaker 4>we all went.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

4077
03:01:32.761 --> 03:01:36.000
<v Speaker 4>so for me it's a lot about that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>rite of passage experience.</v>

4078
03:01:36.001 --> 03:01:36.834
<v Speaker 4>I still really like and appreciate the </v>
<v Speaker 4>plants and I learned a ton and I </v>

4079
03:01:38.970 --> 03:01:43.230
<v Speaker 4>sometimes underestimate how much more I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to learn from the plants for sure.</v>

4080
03:01:43.460 --> 03:01:45.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a combination of that.</v>

4081
03:01:45.350 --> 03:01:46.770
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so anyway was set up this trip.</v>

4082
03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:49.710
<v Speaker 4>Everybody I know we're going to do Iosco</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're meeting Don Howard,</v>

4083
03:01:49.980 --> 03:01:50.641
<v Speaker 4>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4084
03:01:50.641 --> 03:01:52.560
<v Speaker 4>we've done two documentaries with him </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

4085
03:01:52.590 --> 03:01:55.830
<v Speaker 4>Latest Iowasca documentary is with him </v>
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>

4086
03:01:56.160 --> 03:01:57.600
<v Speaker 4>Awesome guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like Gandalf,</v>

4087
03:01:57.601 --> 03:01:59.040
<v Speaker 4>the white wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're setting that up,</v>

4088
03:01:59.490 --> 03:02:01.980
<v Speaker 4>but I knew this one was going to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting because a month,</v>

4089
03:02:02.260 --> 03:02:04.230
<v Speaker 4>about a month before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometime in August,</v>

4090
03:02:04.530 --> 03:02:06.390
<v Speaker 4>I wake up in the middle of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going in September.</v>

4091
03:02:06.391 --> 03:02:08.790
<v Speaker 4>I wake up in the middle of the night and</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4092
03:02:08.820 --> 03:02:13.650
<v Speaker 4>from a dream and in this dream I look </v>
<v Speaker 4>over and to my left side,</v>

4093
03:02:13.651 --> 03:02:14.484
<v Speaker 4>I see this demon head and this gnarly </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking demon head nosferatu looking </v>

4094
03:02:18.871 --> 03:02:19.704
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was just looking away and in my </v>

4095
03:02:21.991 --> 03:02:23.220
<v Speaker 4>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he looks at me,</v>

4096
03:02:23.390 --> 03:02:25.260
<v Speaker 4>it's fairs at me dead in the eye and </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>

4097
03:02:25.261 --> 03:02:28.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to kill you on September 23rd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

4098
03:02:28.770 --> 03:02:30.810
<v Speaker 4>Like super fucking specific,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4099
03:02:31.620 --> 03:02:33.600
<v Speaker 4>So I wake up and I'm a little freaked </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

4100
03:02:33.601 --> 03:02:34.201
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>

4101
03:02:34.201 --> 03:02:35.820
<v Speaker 4>that was specific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I go to my,</v>

4102
03:02:35.821 --> 03:02:38.100
<v Speaker 4>and I knew my Peru trip was over that </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

4103
03:02:38.400 --> 03:02:39.233
<v Speaker 4>I go to the calendar of events,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the itinerary and that night is the </v>

4104
03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:43.313
<v Speaker 4>night we're drinking IOWASCA for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first time cause we were doing what </v>

4105
03:02:44.981 --> 03:02:45.690
<v Speaker 4>Chuma afterwards.</v>

4106
03:02:45.690 --> 03:02:48.170
<v Speaker 4>So September 23rd was the night we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing our WASCO.</v>

4107
03:02:48.180 --> 03:02:50.040
<v Speaker 4>And so do you start thinking your mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>was fucking with you?</v>

4108
03:02:50.340 --> 03:02:51.173
<v Speaker 4>Like for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is just your setting yourself </v>

4109
03:02:53.251 --> 03:02:55.020
<v Speaker 4>up for a fall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4110
03:02:55.570 --> 03:02:57.450
<v Speaker 4>I played out all the scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4111
03:02:57.780 --> 03:03:00.570
<v Speaker 4>And I'd try to like what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was a metaphor.</v>

4112
03:03:00.571 --> 03:03:02.070
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully it wasn't for real.</v>

4113
03:03:02.071 --> 03:03:03.540
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

4114
03:03:03.660 --> 03:03:04.493
<v Speaker 4>and you know I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I might've known that date in my </v>

4115
03:03:06.871 --> 03:03:07.704
<v Speaker 4>head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not trying to think this is </v>

4116
03:03:08.671 --> 03:03:10.710
<v Speaker 4>supernatural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all kind of metaphor.</v>

4117
03:03:10.711 --> 03:03:13.830
<v Speaker 4>But it was very specific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So by the time we get out there,</v>

4118
03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:16.050
<v Speaker 4>I knew that I had this feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4119
03:03:16.051 --> 03:03:16.884
<v Speaker 4>some shit's going to come up here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause that was like something's in my </v>

4120
03:03:19.051 --> 03:03:21.750
<v Speaker 4>psyche that's incredibly specific about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

4121
03:03:22.590 --> 03:03:23.423
<v Speaker 4>So we're going into ceremony.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one thing I like to do to prepare </v>

4122
03:03:26.220 --> 03:03:28.410
<v Speaker 4>for ceremony,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I do this for the whole group,</v>

4123
03:03:28.440 --> 03:03:31.230
<v Speaker 4>is they do a meditation where it anchors</v>
<v Speaker 4>them to their consciousness.</v>

4124
03:03:31.231 --> 03:03:32.790
<v Speaker 4>And I put that consciousness in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart,</v>

4125
03:03:33.180 --> 03:03:34.013
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So cause the head can get really </v>

4126
03:03:34.861 --> 03:03:38.700
<v Speaker 4>squirrely and you can get lost in belief</v>
<v Speaker 4>in different ideas and thoughts.</v>

4127
03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.070
<v Speaker 4>And if you identify yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness,</v>

4128
03:03:41.071 --> 03:03:41.904
<v Speaker 4>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tell them to symbolize is a brilliant </v>

4129
03:03:44.011 --> 03:03:47.940
<v Speaker 4>piece of white light in your heart and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you symbolize that and you imagine that,</v>

4130
03:03:48.540 --> 03:03:49.980
<v Speaker 4>that there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an anchor.</v>

4131
03:03:50.010 --> 03:03:51.990
<v Speaker 4>That's like your anchor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's your anchor to home.</v>

4132
03:03:51.991 --> 03:03:53.070
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4133
03:03:53.071 --> 03:03:54.180
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I talked to him how,</v>

4134
03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:57.770
<v Speaker 4>when you imagine that there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can imagine it actually showing</v>

4135
03:03:57.771 --> 03:03:58.520
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Atomically</v>

4136
03:03:58.520 --> 03:04:00.320
<v Speaker 3>like in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the rules of quantum physics,</v>

4137
03:04:00.321 --> 03:04:01.910
<v Speaker 3>the observer effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you observe it,</v>

4138
03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:02.953
<v Speaker 3>then it's connected to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all yourselves connected to all things </v>

4139
03:04:05.151 --> 03:04:06.840
<v Speaker 3>in space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>connected to the,</v>

4140
03:04:06.841 --> 03:04:09.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the one source of consciousness,</v>

4141
03:04:10.040 --> 03:04:11.630
<v Speaker 3>the collective consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing.</v>

4142
03:04:11.870 --> 03:04:14.600
<v Speaker 3>And it just kind of anchors you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>keeps you in this feeling of safe.</v>

4143
03:04:14.601 --> 03:04:16.850
<v Speaker 3>So whatever's squirly things happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your mind,</v>

4144
03:04:17.210 --> 03:04:20.300
<v Speaker 3>you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is important for the story that</v>

4145
03:04:20.301 --> 03:04:21.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm setting up.</v>

4146
03:04:21.291 --> 03:04:23.630
<v Speaker 3>Cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I do that meditation and that's where</v>

4147
03:04:23.631 --> 03:04:26.750
<v Speaker 3>I go into the psychedelic experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anchored to my heart,</v>

4148
03:04:26.751 --> 03:04:30.260
<v Speaker 3>connected to the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>connected to the infinite through that.</v>

4149
03:04:30.261 --> 03:04:33.560
<v Speaker 3>And it's a very kind of comforting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comforting meditation to do.</v>

4150
03:04:34.340 --> 03:04:35.173
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going through and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take the medicine and right off the </v>

4151
03:04:38.241 --> 03:04:40.050
<v Speaker 3>bat it's like super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4152
03:04:40.051 --> 03:04:40.884
<v Speaker 3>it's super chill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm seeing beautiful scenes like </v>

4153
03:04:42.771 --> 03:04:44.690
<v Speaker 3>flowers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these flowers of light.</v>

4154
03:04:45.050 --> 03:04:47.090
<v Speaker 3>And I get this message like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

4155
03:04:47.091 --> 03:04:47.590
<v Speaker 3>it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

4156
03:04:47.590 --> 03:04:48.920
<v Speaker 3>this one's going to be easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

4157
03:04:48.950 --> 03:04:49.311
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4158
03:04:49.311 --> 03:04:50.450
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is like,</v>

4159
03:04:50.451 --> 03:04:51.284
<v Speaker 3>we're just going to fix a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I felt like what it feels like all </v>

4160
03:04:54.561 --> 03:04:56.390
<v Speaker 3>these little doctors of light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the doctor,</v>

4161
03:04:56.400 --> 03:04:57.021
<v Speaker 3>Cheetos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4162
03:04:57.021 --> 03:04:57.854
<v Speaker 3>these little light beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good going through my body and start </v>

4163
03:05:00.861 --> 03:05:01.694
<v Speaker 3>fixing little different areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fixing little parts in my head and </v>

4164
03:05:04.611 --> 03:05:05.444
<v Speaker 3>they're fixing little parts here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And meanwhile my mind is being </v>

4165
03:05:06.831 --> 03:05:09.740
<v Speaker 3>distracted with flowers and butterflies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's super chill.</v>

4166
03:05:09.920 --> 03:05:10.753
<v Speaker 3>The only memorable vision I had was I go</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this shrine in this jungle and I see </v>

4167
03:05:14.481 --> 03:05:15.314
<v Speaker 3>this giant monkey human hybrid that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>super happy and it's like they're just </v>

4168
03:05:21.081 --> 03:05:24.860
<v Speaker 3>butterflies and everything going around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in scripted in stone it says we</v>

4169
03:05:24.861 --> 03:05:27.020
<v Speaker 3>are the pleasure monkeys and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been,</v>

4170
03:05:27.030 --> 03:05:27.863
<v Speaker 3>have been using that word today and has </v>
<v Speaker 3>this like really cool thing like Oh </v>

4171
03:05:30.261 --> 03:05:31.550
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are pleasure monkeys,</v>

4172
03:05:31.551 --> 03:05:34.340
<v Speaker 3>we're here to enjoy all of the best shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can.</v>

4173
03:05:34.340 --> 03:05:36.330
<v Speaker 3>And I start thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4174
03:05:36.380 --> 03:05:40.550
<v Speaker 3>the foods and the people and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>camaraderie and everything around me.</v>

4175
03:05:40.820 --> 03:05:41.653
<v Speaker 3>Super Positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile the light's going through my </v>

4176
03:05:42.891 --> 03:05:47.690
<v Speaker 3>body and fixing it and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as this really idyllic thing and I think</v>

4177
03:05:47.930 --> 03:05:49.340
<v Speaker 3>we're at an hour and a half and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4178
03:05:49.341 --> 03:05:50.360
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're good.</v>

4179
03:05:50.450 --> 03:05:51.283
<v Speaker 3>Like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This demon was not going to worry about </v>

4180
03:05:53.151 --> 03:05:53.984
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>

4181
03:05:54.170 --> 03:05:58.970
<v Speaker 3>And then right to my left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see this gnarly looking Gollum,</v>

4182
03:05:58.971 --> 03:06:03.971
<v Speaker 3>Lord of the Rings Looking fucking my </v>
<v Speaker 3>precious knows fraud to demon guy.</v>

4183
03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:08.720
<v Speaker 3>And he looks at me and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

4184
03:06:08.930 --> 03:06:09.763
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the practices that I have is </v>

4185
03:06:10.731 --> 03:06:12.980
<v Speaker 3>anchoring to that point in my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4186
03:06:12.981 --> 03:06:13.850
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4187
03:06:14.120 --> 03:06:14.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I encourage the feeling of </v>

4188
03:06:15.741 --> 03:06:17.630
<v Speaker 3>invincibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he can't be harmed,</v>

4189
03:06:17.690 --> 03:06:19.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is your consciousness.</v>

4190
03:06:19.101 --> 03:06:21.320
<v Speaker 3>It's this peace in your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't be harmed.</v>

4191
03:06:21.321 --> 03:06:24.230
<v Speaker 3>And I see this demon and it looks at me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it jumps,</v>

4192
03:06:24.290 --> 03:06:26.570
<v Speaker 3>jumps towards me and it starts biting my</v>
<v Speaker 3>neck.</v>

4193
03:06:26.630 --> 03:06:27.680
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my vision.</v>

4194
03:06:27.681 --> 03:06:28.514
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's gnarly looking demon is biting </v>

4195
03:06:30.580 --> 03:06:32.450
<v Speaker 3>my vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4196
03:06:32.630 --> 03:06:33.463
<v Speaker 3>it's all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all in this like a movie of me </v>

4197
03:06:34.851 --> 03:06:35.930
<v Speaker 3>being played out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4198
03:06:36.430 --> 03:06:39.500
<v Speaker 3>I think you just going with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the emotion ratchet it up,</v>

4199
03:06:39.920 --> 03:06:41.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at this point,</v>

4200
03:06:41.090 --> 03:06:42.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's eating in my,</v>

4201
03:06:42.950 --> 03:06:44.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that vision,</v>

4202
03:06:44.571 --> 03:06:45.404
<v Speaker 3>it's eating through my neck and I see </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it's aim is and it's aiming to eat </v>

4203
03:06:48.651 --> 03:06:51.530
<v Speaker 3>through my neck and eat that thing in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>heart.</v>

4204
03:06:51.800 --> 03:06:55.100
<v Speaker 3>The white light in my heart that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been meditating about.</v>

4205
03:06:55.110 --> 03:06:57.050
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what it wants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in,</v>

4206
03:06:57.110 --> 03:07:00.210
<v Speaker 3>in what I thought was this like heroic </v>
<v Speaker 3>act of invincibility,</v>

4207
03:07:00.600 --> 03:07:02.490
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go ahead man,</v>

4208
03:07:02.520 --> 03:07:03.690
<v Speaker 3>you want that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>

4209
03:07:03.720 --> 03:07:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Eat all the way through me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get that thing,</v>

4210
03:07:05.730 --> 03:07:07.140
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4211
03:07:07.440 --> 03:07:08.273
<v Speaker 3>Instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I've learned in a lot of these </v>

4212
03:07:09.301 --> 03:07:11.190
<v Speaker 3>practices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you resist these things,</v>

4213
03:07:11.490 --> 03:07:14.880
<v Speaker 3>the more aggressive they become and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>harder you just get in this,</v>

4214
03:07:15.120 --> 03:07:15.720
<v Speaker 3>this dance.</v>

4215
03:07:15.720 --> 03:07:18.900
<v Speaker 3>So it was more you surrender generally </v>
<v Speaker 3>the better off you are.</v>

4216
03:07:18.901 --> 03:07:20.130
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh you want to eat that thing,</v>

4217
03:07:20.131 --> 03:07:23.190
<v Speaker 3>go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it goes through each through my neck,</v>

4218
03:07:23.220 --> 03:07:24.053
<v Speaker 3>through my chest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it grabs a hold of that piece of </v>

4219
03:07:26.701 --> 03:07:28.830
<v Speaker 3>white light in my heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snatches it.</v>

4220
03:07:29.250 --> 03:07:32.400
<v Speaker 3>And right at that moment I've never felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>more free.</v>

4221
03:07:32.410 --> 03:07:33.243
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I got shot with a bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I felt like I went dead completely </v>

4222
03:07:37.110 --> 03:07:42.030
<v Speaker 3>dead and fear just shot through my </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire body and I was like,</v>

4223
03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:45.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just gave this demon my consciousness.</v>

4224
03:07:45.121 --> 03:07:47.610
<v Speaker 3>I just gave this team in my soul and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>let them have it.</v>

4225
03:07:47.611 --> 03:07:49.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like all the fucking vampire </v>
<v Speaker 3>movies,</v>

4226
03:07:49.291 --> 03:07:51.240
<v Speaker 3>like they can't come in unless you give </v>
<v Speaker 3>them permission,</v>

4227
03:07:51.241 --> 03:07:53.730
<v Speaker 3>then you give them permission and all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these fucking thoughts are going through</v>

4228
03:07:53.731 --> 03:07:55.920
<v Speaker 3>my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And meanwhile I felt completely dead,</v>

4229
03:07:56.010 --> 03:07:57.360
<v Speaker 3>like hollow from the inside.</v>

4230
03:07:57.360 --> 03:07:58.193
<v Speaker 3>Fear was that like 1000% and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>eco rows of the sham and start getting </v>

4231
03:08:01.801 --> 03:08:02.760
<v Speaker 3>more intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

4232
03:08:03.300 --> 03:08:04.410
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucked.</v>

4233
03:08:04.440 --> 03:08:07.800
<v Speaker 3>So I started negotiating with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>nosferatu demon guy and I was like,</v>

4234
03:08:07.801 --> 03:08:09.750
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd really like to get my piece back.</v>

4235
03:08:09.751 --> 03:08:11.430
<v Speaker 3>Like you mind giving it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4236
03:08:11.730 --> 03:08:12.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all good.</v>

4237
03:08:12.541 --> 03:08:14.130
<v Speaker 3>I understand you have your place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4238
03:08:14.131 --> 03:08:16.410
<v Speaker 3>for polarity to exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there needs to be the dark that needs to</v>

4239
03:08:16.411 --> 03:08:17.430
<v Speaker 3>be the light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4240
03:08:17.431 --> 03:08:19.080
<v Speaker 3>it's all good man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all on the same team.</v>

4241
03:08:19.081 --> 03:08:20.340
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4242
03:08:20.570 --> 03:08:22.650
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's having none of it.</v>

4243
03:08:22.920 --> 03:08:23.731
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then finally,</v>

4244
03:08:23.731 --> 03:08:25.530
<v Speaker 3>is he like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4245
03:08:25.531 --> 03:08:26.364
<v Speaker 3>he's sometimes talking back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes just kind of like mocking me </v>

4246
03:08:28.861 --> 03:08:31.110
<v Speaker 3>really like kind of laughing and then he</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

4247
03:08:31.140 --> 03:08:33.060
<v Speaker 3>here you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it gives me something,</v>

4248
03:08:33.300 --> 03:08:35.370
<v Speaker 3>and I greedily like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a hungry,</v>

4249
03:08:35.520 --> 03:08:37.110
<v Speaker 3>like a hungry child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like grab it.</v>

4250
03:08:37.350 --> 03:08:40.320
<v Speaker 3>And I stuffed it in my heart and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead piece of rock,</v>

4251
03:08:40.321 --> 03:08:41.154
<v Speaker 3>like a dead stone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just this demons just laughing </v>

4252
03:08:43.021 --> 03:08:43.854
<v Speaker 3>at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I have your heart and watch where </v>

4253
03:08:46.201 --> 03:08:47.034
<v Speaker 3>I'm going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes and he takes it and I'm </v>

4254
03:08:48.601 --> 03:08:49.960
<v Speaker 3>following him and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

4255
03:08:49.980 --> 03:08:50.813
<v Speaker 3>through this kind of like wormhole thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he takes it and I see who he's </v>

4256
03:08:54.061 --> 03:08:56.820
<v Speaker 3>giving it to and then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>

4257
03:08:56.970 --> 03:09:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Because he's giving it to the demon of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all demons.</v>

4258
03:09:00.331 --> 03:09:02.370
<v Speaker 3>And this is very archetypical and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>not religious,</v>

4259
03:09:02.371 --> 03:09:04.620
<v Speaker 3>but these archetypes are coming through </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this kind of,</v>

4260
03:09:05.120 --> 03:09:06.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>demon,</v>

4261
03:09:06.490 --> 03:09:08.400
<v Speaker 3>demon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kibo type of sense.</v>

4262
03:09:08.401 --> 03:09:10.740
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this demon that he gives it to,</v>

4263
03:09:10.770 --> 03:09:15.420
<v Speaker 3>I can only call the world crusher </v>
<v Speaker 3>because literally he's of the size where</v>

4264
03:09:15.421 --> 03:09:20.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm seeing him hold planets and crushing</v>
<v Speaker 3>them into dust in his hands.</v>

4265
03:09:20.310 --> 03:09:24.930
<v Speaker 3>And he's just moving the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These giant horns made of this deep,</v>

4266
03:09:24.960 --> 03:09:25.793
<v Speaker 3>dark black and red smoke and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing in the ecstasy of destruction </v>

4267
03:09:30.721 --> 03:09:31.554
<v Speaker 3>as he takes galaxies and he rips them </v>
<v Speaker 3>apart like the ultimate black hole of </v>

4268
03:09:35.281 --> 03:09:37.080
<v Speaker 3>destruction and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

4269
03:09:37.081 --> 03:09:40.560
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that guy's got my heart piece now.</v>

4270
03:09:40.750 --> 03:09:43.170
<v Speaker 3>I like the little demon gave it to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

4271
03:09:43.380 --> 03:09:45.030
<v Speaker 3>So I'm thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck do I do?</v>

4272
03:09:45.031 --> 03:09:47.850
<v Speaker 3>I can't even communicate with his demon </v>
<v Speaker 3>world crusher.</v>

4273
03:09:47.880 --> 03:09:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way I can even talk to him.</v>

4274
03:09:50.641 --> 03:09:51.810
<v Speaker 3>He's too big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I try to like,</v>

4275
03:09:51.811 --> 03:09:53.820
<v Speaker 3>well maybe I can blow myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4276
03:09:53.840 --> 03:09:56.650
<v Speaker 3>maybe I can get bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking like video game style,</v>

4277
03:09:56.680 --> 03:09:57.513
<v Speaker 3>like that's going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe if I fucking get bigger than </v>

4278
03:09:59.621 --> 03:10:02.530
<v Speaker 3>we can talk and negotiate and I'll be on</v>
<v Speaker 3>his level.</v>

4279
03:10:02.890 --> 03:10:03.940
<v Speaker 3>Totally doesn't work.</v>

4280
03:10:03.970 --> 03:10:07.330
<v Speaker 3>I can't get even near the size of him </v>
<v Speaker 3>and my vision.</v>

4281
03:10:08.050 --> 03:10:09.700
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

4282
03:10:09.701 --> 03:10:12.190
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what am I going to fucking do here?</v>

4283
03:10:12.550 --> 03:10:15.010
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I get the idea,</v>

4284
03:10:15.011 --> 03:10:15.844
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4285
03:10:16.060 --> 03:10:18.070
<v Speaker 3>I can't fight this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

4286
03:10:18.340 --> 03:10:20.740
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding that again,</v>

4287
03:10:20.741 --> 03:10:23.890
<v Speaker 3>that the consciousness in the cosmos </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs dark and light.</v>

4288
03:10:24.190 --> 03:10:27.700
<v Speaker 3>I understand the value of the polarity </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that something that dark,</v>

4289
03:10:27.960 --> 03:10:29.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that that's necessary.</v>

4290
03:10:29.950 --> 03:10:30.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4291
03:10:30.490 --> 03:10:35.320
<v Speaker 3>I got to send this thing love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I go and I imagine floating up to its</v>

4292
03:10:35.321 --> 03:10:39.730
<v Speaker 3>head and right between its eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kissed him on the forehead and it's,</v>

4293
03:10:39.731 --> 03:10:44.710
<v Speaker 3>I know it sounds weird and for a moment </v>
<v Speaker 3>I see his eyes go google the eyes,</v>

4294
03:10:44.711 --> 03:10:47.750
<v Speaker 3>like the Emoji heart thing where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>heart's appeared,</v>

4295
03:10:48.500 --> 03:10:51.250
<v Speaker 3>crushers eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was really kind of cartoony.</v>

4296
03:10:51.280 --> 03:10:54.660
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that moment he relinquishes and he's</v>

4297
03:10:54.670 --> 03:10:56.050
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4298
03:10:56.470 --> 03:10:58.450
<v Speaker 3>I can give this back to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we never took it.</v>

4299
03:10:58.570 --> 03:11:00.130
<v Speaker 3>No one can take that piece of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>heart.</v>

4300
03:11:00.131 --> 03:11:01.410
<v Speaker 3>It's yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4301
03:11:01.450 --> 03:11:03.970
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible to steal unless you </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it can steal.</v>

4302
03:11:03.971 --> 03:11:06.220
<v Speaker 3>And it was just like beautiful wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

4303
03:11:06.250 --> 03:11:07.540
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God.</v>

4304
03:11:07.900 --> 03:11:10.090
<v Speaker 3>But I was still like shaken up by that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4305
03:11:10.091 --> 03:11:12.610
<v Speaker 3>I was still kind of fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that move worked.</v>

4306
03:11:12.611 --> 03:11:15.170
<v Speaker 3>And in that moment where his eyes were </v>
<v Speaker 3>all googly hard,</v>

4307
03:11:15.171 --> 03:11:15.671
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4308
03:11:15.671 --> 03:11:16.900
<v Speaker 3>we can't take that from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your,</v>

4309
03:11:16.910 --> 03:11:17.743
<v Speaker 3>so I had this renewed sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>confidence and so I started kind of </v>

4310
03:11:20.831 --> 03:11:21.664
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of more peaceful then it </v>

4311
03:11:23.050 --> 03:11:24.220
<v Speaker 3>grows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seem to be falling.</v>

4312
03:11:24.221 --> 03:11:25.054
<v Speaker 3>My trip died down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going through about all the </v>

4313
03:11:26.951 --> 03:11:29.030
<v Speaker 3>relations in my life and the different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4314
03:11:29.170 --> 03:11:32.140
<v Speaker 3>kind of doing the general work you do on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca and I get to,</v>

4315
03:11:32.500 --> 03:11:33.333
<v Speaker 3>I'm a member of my family who's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering from some mental illness is </v>

4316
03:11:37.240 --> 03:11:39.100
<v Speaker 3>really dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a dark mental illness.</v>

4317
03:11:39.640 --> 03:11:41.890
<v Speaker 3>And I think that now maybe the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>crusher,</v>

4318
03:11:42.060 --> 03:11:42.893
<v Speaker 3>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I get the feeling of the world </v>

4319
03:11:44.621 --> 03:11:47.380
<v Speaker 3>crusher has that element of darkness is </v>
<v Speaker 3>in him.</v>

4320
03:11:47.950 --> 03:11:52.950
<v Speaker 3>So I think in my imagination and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kind of call back on that,</v>

4321
03:11:53.080 --> 03:11:53.913
<v Speaker 3>on that being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and immediately it comes up but in a </v>

4322
03:11:55.781 --> 03:11:59.170
<v Speaker 3>different shape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a giant fucking sea serpent.</v>

4323
03:11:59.171 --> 03:12:01.810
<v Speaker 3>And it's wrapping these tentacles around</v>
<v Speaker 3>my body,</v>

4324
03:12:01.811 --> 03:12:04.840
<v Speaker 3>like a Leviathan from the deep and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4325
03:12:04.960 --> 03:12:06.040
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

4326
03:12:06.130 --> 03:12:07.420
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4327
03:12:07.421 --> 03:12:09.910
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about maybe letting </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know this,</v>

4328
03:12:09.940 --> 03:12:12.130
<v Speaker 3>this family member,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about letting him go?</v>

4329
03:12:12.580 --> 03:12:14.890
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want his soul?</v>

4330
03:12:14.891 --> 03:12:19.120
<v Speaker 3>I'll make a trade your soul for his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

4331
03:12:19.121 --> 03:12:20.320
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>

4332
03:12:20.500 --> 03:12:21.370
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4333
03:12:21.371 --> 03:12:23.620
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so at that point I was like,</v>

4334
03:12:23.621 --> 03:12:25.720
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was like,</v>

4335
03:12:25.721 --> 03:12:26.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I can make that trade.</v>

4336
03:12:26.780 --> 03:12:29.380
<v Speaker 3>He's like cower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you wouldn't do that for someone you</v>

4337
03:12:29.381 --> 03:12:30.640
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a coward.</v>

4338
03:12:30.790 --> 03:12:33.010
<v Speaker 3>I thought you said you were invincible </v>
<v Speaker 3>and starts mocking me.</v>

4339
03:12:33.190 --> 03:12:36.220
<v Speaker 3>Clearly not my homie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like clearly take the world crashed,</v>

4340
03:12:36.270 --> 03:12:39.340
<v Speaker 3>takes his job seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So eventually I have to go like,</v>

4341
03:12:39.341 --> 03:12:40.780
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's between you and him.</v>

4342
03:12:40.810 --> 03:12:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I can't step in there like there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing that I can do for you.</v>

4343
03:12:45.251 --> 03:12:47.170
<v Speaker 3>So I just had to let it go and I let </v>
<v Speaker 3>them go.</v>

4344
03:12:47.171 --> 03:12:49.390
<v Speaker 3>Not Making that proverbial deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

4345
03:12:49.391 --> 03:12:51.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't think this is like really </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

4346
03:12:51.050 --> 03:12:52.490
<v Speaker 3>This could just be an archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4347
03:12:52.570 --> 03:12:54.530
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so anyways,</v>

4348
03:12:54.560 --> 03:12:56.120
<v Speaker 3>from there I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>

4349
03:12:56.121 --> 03:12:57.770
<v Speaker 3>this is turned super dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4350
03:12:57.771 --> 03:13:00.650
<v Speaker 3>can I get some help?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in since the archetype was demons,</v>

4351
03:13:00.651 --> 03:13:02.690
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I get a Jesus in here?</v>

4352
03:13:02.691 --> 03:13:06.560
<v Speaker 3>Something like some kind of light and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing light would come.</v>

4353
03:13:06.560 --> 03:13:07.393
<v Speaker 3>Although I did get a cool vision of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus meeting the world crusher and I </v>

4354
03:13:10.731 --> 03:13:11.301
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

4355
03:13:11.301 --> 03:13:12.134
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be squared like </v>
<v Speaker 3>showdown UFC ultimate Jesus versus the </v>

4356
03:13:15.471 --> 03:13:16.304
<v Speaker 3>world crusher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And immediately they turned super gay </v>

4357
03:13:18.680 --> 03:13:21.440
<v Speaker 3>and they started making out with each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other and having sex.</v>

4358
03:13:21.441 --> 03:13:22.274
<v Speaker 3>Jesus in the world crusher started like </v>
<v Speaker 3>having sex with each other and it was </v>

4359
03:13:26.091 --> 03:13:26.924
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the wildest vision cause it was </v>

4360
03:13:28.431 --> 03:13:32.480
<v Speaker 3>this like the ultimate love affair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the two polarities of the cosmos,</v>

4361
03:13:32.481 --> 03:13:35.420
<v Speaker 3>like all of the love and forgiveness and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the power.</v>

4362
03:13:35.421 --> 03:13:39.110
<v Speaker 3>Who was the destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pack in darkness was the top,</v>

4363
03:13:39.130 --> 03:13:41.660
<v Speaker 3>the doctor's bag of Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus would turn,</v>

4364
03:13:41.661 --> 03:13:43.730
<v Speaker 3>he was man woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like super.</v>

4365
03:13:43.850 --> 03:13:44.683
<v Speaker 3>He could be whatever he wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were dancing in this like </v>

4366
03:13:46.820 --> 03:13:49.670
<v Speaker 3>passionate love affair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was like all creation.</v>

4367
03:13:49.720 --> 03:13:52.750
<v Speaker 3>So Jesus became man and woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus man,</v>

4368
03:13:52.760 --> 03:13:53.240
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>

4369
03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:54.073
<v Speaker 3>He was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just like love versus power and </v>

4370
03:13:56.721 --> 03:13:57.554
<v Speaker 3>darken and destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Creation versus structured like the two </v>

4371
03:13:59.751 --> 03:14:04.640
<v Speaker 3>polarities dancing but expressed as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world crusher is devil like creature.</v>

4372
03:14:04.641 --> 03:14:06.020
<v Speaker 3>And then Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4373
03:14:06.021 --> 03:14:09.440
<v Speaker 3>which started as kind of Jesusy and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>went and a woman and then went into man,</v>

4374
03:14:09.740 --> 03:14:11.900
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least gave me a chuckle.</v>

4375
03:14:12.200 --> 03:14:16.190
<v Speaker 3>And it was like a moment of like relief </v>
<v Speaker 3>from this really fucking heavy trip.</v>

4376
03:14:16.790 --> 03:14:17.623
<v Speaker 3>But I still wasn't getting any personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction from anything on the light </v>

4377
03:14:19.791 --> 03:14:20.720
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4378
03:14:21.020 --> 03:14:23.270
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm still like kind of a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>shaken up,</v>

4379
03:14:23.271 --> 03:14:24.590
<v Speaker 3>especially after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4380
03:14:24.620 --> 03:14:27.380
<v Speaker 3>the world crusher called me a coward and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't help you know,</v>

4381
03:14:27.470 --> 03:14:29.930
<v Speaker 3>this person in my family and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

4382
03:14:30.260 --> 03:14:32.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then I see this,</v>

4383
03:14:32.350 --> 03:14:34.340
<v Speaker 3>I keep trying to reach out to like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>helpers,</v>

4384
03:14:34.341 --> 03:14:38.840
<v Speaker 3>like something from the light and I get </v>
<v Speaker 3>this very faint message.</v>

4385
03:14:38.900 --> 03:14:39.733
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the visions are super clear </v>

4386
03:14:40.491 --> 03:14:42.030
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes they're faint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels like you're,</v>

4387
03:14:42.230 --> 03:14:44.390
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of reaching for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'll go with that.</v>

4388
03:14:44.391 --> 03:14:46.850
<v Speaker 3>I'll use my imagination is a bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I kind of go with it.</v>

4389
03:14:47.300 --> 03:14:48.133
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we have this thing for you and put </v>

4390
03:14:50.391 --> 03:14:52.070
<v Speaker 3>it in your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll give you extra,</v>

4391
03:14:52.160 --> 03:14:54.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be what you're looking for.</v>

4392
03:14:54.021 --> 03:14:56.740
<v Speaker 3>And is this brilliant?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ruby like redstone,</v>

4393
03:14:57.210 --> 03:14:58.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's brilliant.</v>

4394
03:14:58.251 --> 03:14:59.270
<v Speaker 3>Ruby stone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

4395
03:14:59.330 --> 03:15:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's beautiful.</v>

4396
03:15:00.471 --> 03:15:03.350
<v Speaker 3>Like I always imagined the thing in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>heart being white but red.</v>

4397
03:15:03.351 --> 03:15:04.184
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cool.</v>

4398
03:15:04.640 --> 03:15:05.473
<v Speaker 3>I put it in my chest and then instantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>I could feel myself getting this like </v>

4399
03:15:09.080 --> 03:15:13.070
<v Speaker 3>hunger for power and feeling like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world crusher,</v>

4400
03:15:13.100 --> 03:15:16.550
<v Speaker 3>like I wanted to destroy and manipulate </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

4401
03:15:16.910 --> 03:15:18.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the thing.</v>

4402
03:15:19.300 --> 03:15:20.091
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

4403
03:15:20.091 --> 03:15:22.700
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't a real gift that was getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>tricked again.</v>

4404
03:15:23.060 --> 03:15:23.893
<v Speaker 3>So I pull this thing out of my heart and</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure like I can just feel the evil </v>

4405
03:15:27.020 --> 03:15:28.730
<v Speaker 3>emanating from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4406
03:15:28.731 --> 03:15:31.290
<v Speaker 3>And I can hear the distant laughter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world crusher,</v>

4407
03:15:31.300 --> 03:15:32.780
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ha ha ha fooled you again.</v>

4408
03:15:32.781 --> 03:15:33.614
<v Speaker 3>You accepted this stone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I have this ruby stone in my </v>

4409
03:15:36.231 --> 03:15:37.280
<v Speaker 3>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4410
03:15:37.281 --> 03:15:39.080
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck am I going to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

4411
03:15:39.230 --> 03:15:41.180
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I have this place that I've developed</v>

4412
03:15:41.181 --> 03:15:42.710
<v Speaker 3>in my meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a little hat.</v>

4413
03:15:42.740 --> 03:15:44.030
<v Speaker 3>It's like my happy place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4414
03:15:44.170 --> 03:15:46.400
<v Speaker 3>It's place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go and I imagine it in my mind,</v>

4415
03:15:46.401 --> 03:15:47.480
<v Speaker 3>it's like my happy place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

4416
03:15:47.481 --> 03:15:48.314
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna put my stone in my place and </v>

4417
03:15:49.681 --> 03:15:52.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna leave it there in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my vision.</v>

4418
03:15:52.410 --> 03:15:53.243
<v Speaker 3>Why put it there and the happy place and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns to fucking like swamp and bog </v>

4419
03:15:56.881 --> 03:15:57.990
<v Speaker 3>and everything.</v>

4420
03:15:58.020 --> 03:16:01.680
<v Speaker 3>All the trees are withering like you see</v>
<v Speaker 3>in one of those fantasy movies where the</v>

4421
03:16:01.681 --> 03:16:05.260
<v Speaker 3>darkness anchors into a place and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the life dies around.</v>

4422
03:16:05.261 --> 03:16:06.630
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>

4423
03:16:06.631 --> 03:16:08.520
<v Speaker 3>I can't put it there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to destroy this,</v>

4424
03:16:08.810 --> 03:16:09.643
<v Speaker 3>this world I created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I bring it back and I was </v>

4425
03:16:11.701 --> 03:16:12.810
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear this voice,</v>

4426
03:16:12.811 --> 03:16:14.460
<v Speaker 3>like just put it in your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can hold it.</v>

4427
03:16:14.500 --> 03:16:16.020
<v Speaker 3>You're strong enough to hold it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

4428
03:16:16.021 --> 03:16:16.770
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4429
03:16:16.770 --> 03:16:18.420
<v Speaker 3>maybe my heart is the only place I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>put it.</v>

4430
03:16:18.421 --> 03:16:21.000
<v Speaker 3>It's the only way it's gonna be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put it back in there.</v>

4431
03:16:21.360 --> 03:16:23.670
<v Speaker 3>Bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously that was another trick.</v>

4432
03:16:23.970 --> 03:16:24.803
<v Speaker 3>But I'm really getting shaken here </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I keep getting fucking tricked </v>

4433
03:16:27.600 --> 03:16:28.433
<v Speaker 3>and I keep not knowing what my mind is </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me that's helpful or whether </v>

4434
03:16:30.961 --> 03:16:31.794
<v Speaker 3>it's coming from something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So eventually I would like move it out </v>

4435
03:16:34.891 --> 03:16:37.020
<v Speaker 3>of my body and I'm looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4436
03:16:37.650 --> 03:16:38.040
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

4437
03:16:38.040 --> 03:16:38.873
<v Speaker 3>The only way that I can get rid of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is to dissolve it evenly across the </v>

4438
03:16:42.121 --> 03:16:44.730
<v Speaker 3>entire spectrum of creation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4439
03:16:45.030 --> 03:16:49.110
<v Speaker 3>Take this and dissolve it into the all </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that the entire game,</v>

4440
03:16:49.140 --> 03:16:50.580
<v Speaker 3>all of good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of bad,</v>

4441
03:16:50.610 --> 03:16:51.443
<v Speaker 3>everything can hold this amount of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too concentrated for any one thing </v>

4442
03:16:54.751 --> 03:16:56.400
<v Speaker 3>to hold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to dissolve it.</v>

4443
03:16:56.880 --> 03:16:59.370
<v Speaker 3>And I tried that move with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination and it worked.</v>

4444
03:16:59.730 --> 03:17:01.740
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the red stone dissolves.</v>

4445
03:17:01.741 --> 03:17:04.620
<v Speaker 3>And then all of creation holds that </v>
<v Speaker 3>darkness and that power.</v>

4446
03:17:05.310 --> 03:17:09.030
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sitting there and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this point just fucking surrender.</v>

4447
03:17:09.060 --> 03:17:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Like I've just been totally getting my </v>
<v Speaker 3>ass kicked,</v>

4448
03:17:11.820 --> 03:17:13.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the majority of this trip.</v>

4449
03:17:14.130 --> 03:17:16.080
<v Speaker 3>And especially just having been tricked </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4450
03:17:16.450 --> 03:17:18.930
<v Speaker 3>and I'm just kind of like in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>surrender.</v>

4451
03:17:19.140 --> 03:17:23.910
<v Speaker 3>And at that point I feel like kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like iron man style,</v>

4452
03:17:24.090 --> 03:17:24.923
<v Speaker 3>I feel this like breastplate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like come slap onto my chest and it has </v>

4453
03:17:27.991 --> 03:17:30.360
<v Speaker 3>this really beautiful fire opal stone.</v>

4454
03:17:30.600 --> 03:17:34.080
<v Speaker 3>And this thing is helmet come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my head pink and his helmet comes and it</v>

4455
03:17:34.081 --> 03:17:38.520
<v Speaker 3>has this other brilliant white light and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel wings shoot out from my back.</v>

4456
03:17:38.700 --> 03:17:40.830
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's obviously,</v>

4457
03:17:40.831 --> 03:17:41.380
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost,</v>

4458
03:17:41.380 --> 03:17:43.220
<v Speaker 3>it's shit's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4459
03:17:43.350 --> 03:17:47.820
<v Speaker 3>and I'm flying in the air and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of like eagles and other birds and</v>

4460
03:17:47.821 --> 03:17:52.800
<v Speaker 3>it's all like peaceful and all good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like all of the allies,</v>

4461
03:17:52.801 --> 03:17:56.340
<v Speaker 3>like all of the good guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the good team Kinda came through and</v>

4462
03:17:56.341 --> 03:17:57.174
<v Speaker 3>they were flying over this world that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was dark and fires and pollution and </v>

4463
03:18:00.210 --> 03:18:01.043
<v Speaker 3>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were just bringing this like </v>

4464
03:18:03.061 --> 03:18:05.820
<v Speaker 3>fresh air of like white light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was just cruising.</v>

4465
03:18:06.120 --> 03:18:08.160
<v Speaker 3>And so for the last 30 minutes of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trip,</v>

4466
03:18:08.460 --> 03:18:11.810
<v Speaker 3>I was just literally like flapping my </v>
<v Speaker 3>wings in division,</v>

4467
03:18:11.940 --> 03:18:14.790
<v Speaker 3>just Kinda cruising over the world with </v>
<v Speaker 3>all my ego.</v>

4468
03:18:14.790 --> 03:18:19.790
<v Speaker 3>Homeys and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was fucking one of the GNARLIEST,</v>

4469
03:18:19.891 --> 03:18:24.420
<v Speaker 3>obviously experiences I've ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No doubt.</v>

4470
03:18:24.480 --> 03:18:25.313
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But your speech is going to be used in </v>

4471
03:18:27.911 --> 03:18:28.744
<v Speaker 3>the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to get together with </v>

4472
03:18:29.401 --> 03:18:31.740
<v Speaker 3>Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got to play this speech back.</v>

4473
03:18:31.770 --> 03:18:33.390
<v Speaker 3>This is a successful guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>

4474
03:18:33.510 --> 03:18:34.590
<v Speaker 3>Look what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4475
03:18:34.700 --> 03:18:39.630
<v Speaker 3>It goes down with the God damn jungle </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting world crushers and Jesus's Gay.</v>

4476
03:18:39.660 --> 03:18:41.970
<v Speaker 3>Do you want Jesus to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want that?</v>

4477
03:18:42.360 --> 03:18:43.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me a woman.</v>

4478
03:18:43.950 --> 03:18:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Jesus can be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can be a woman.</v>

4479
03:18:46.021 --> 03:18:48.570
<v Speaker 3>He's gender fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

4480
03:18:48.610 --> 03:18:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And tense.</v>

4481
03:18:50.290 --> 03:18:52.840
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the lessons necessary,</v>

4482
03:18:53.290 --> 03:18:54.123
<v Speaker 3>it's really just about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the type of resistance that </v>

4483
03:18:56.771 --> 03:18:59.050
<v Speaker 3>could summon the very best out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4484
03:18:59.051 --> 03:19:02.920
<v Speaker 3>the move to move to show the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Krush her love the move to,</v>

4485
03:19:03.220 --> 03:19:05.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the moves that I had to make.</v>

4486
03:19:05.200 --> 03:19:06.033
<v Speaker 3>I was only able to learn about myself </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the extreme pressure of that </v>

4487
03:19:09.251 --> 03:19:11.590
<v Speaker 3>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the beautiful parts of</v>

4488
03:19:11.620 --> 03:19:15.040
<v Speaker 3>the IOWASCA vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It tends to give you just enough that if</v>

4489
03:19:15.041 --> 03:19:18.040
<v Speaker 3>you show up with your best and you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you choose,</v>

4490
03:19:18.070 --> 03:19:20.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>choose love and you choose the,</v>

4491
03:19:20.500 --> 03:19:22.570
<v Speaker 3>the things that are going to bring out </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best outcome,</v>

4492
03:19:23.500 --> 03:19:24.610
<v Speaker 3>you'll make it through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

4493
03:19:24.640 --> 03:19:27.550
<v Speaker 3>but it brings you to that very fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>brink where it feels like,</v>

4494
03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:29.260
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4495
03:19:29.261 --> 03:19:30.910
<v Speaker 3>the stakes are really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really high.</v>

4496
03:19:31.450 --> 03:19:33.250
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because I think stories</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that</v>

4497
03:19:33.990 --> 03:19:34.823
<v Speaker 5>and experiences like yours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although you've got to go somewhere to </v>

4498
03:19:37.561 --> 03:19:38.394
<v Speaker 5>experience them legally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the those stories are what people are </v>

4499
03:19:42.001 --> 03:19:42.834
<v Speaker 5>going to rely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like almost like a road map of </v>

4500
03:19:45.511 --> 03:19:48.540
<v Speaker 5>the potential experiences that people </v>
<v Speaker 5>are gonna come back with and go to,</v>

4501
03:19:48.541 --> 03:19:49.890
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look what he's saying about this.</v>

4502
03:19:49.891 --> 03:19:51.060
<v Speaker 5>Do you want it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to go there?</v>

4503
03:19:51.210 --> 03:19:52.440
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to go?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do we get there?</v>

4504
03:19:52.470 --> 03:19:53.303
<v Speaker 5>You got to go over the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go over the mountain to meet the </v>

4505
03:19:54.541 --> 03:19:55.920
<v Speaker 5>world crusher.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man.</v>

4506
03:19:56.550 --> 03:19:58.080
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He definitely came back.</v>

4507
03:19:58.110 --> 03:19:58.801
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's back,</v>

4508
03:19:58.801 --> 03:19:59.730
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's in Austin.</v>

4509
03:19:59.760 --> 03:20:00.630
<v Speaker 5>He's hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4510
03:20:00.980 --> 03:20:01.813
<v Speaker 5>Like one day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all this stuff is going to be legal and </v>

4511
03:20:04.381 --> 03:20:07.290
<v Speaker 5>one day all sorts of psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences,</v>

4512
03:20:07.291 --> 03:20:09.930
<v Speaker 5>whether it's masculine or fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms,</v>

4513
03:20:09.931 --> 03:20:10.764
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all going to be really </v>

4514
03:20:12.250 --> 03:20:13.083
<v Speaker 5>commonplace.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to be as commonplace is </v>

4515
03:20:14.491 --> 03:20:16.530
<v Speaker 5>going to get a massage or it's common </v>
<v Speaker 5>places,</v>

4516
03:20:17.100 --> 03:20:18.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking a yoga class.</v>

4517
03:20:19.590 --> 03:20:20.423
<v Speaker 5>Just right now we're in a weird place </v>
<v Speaker 5>where someone like you tell him that </v>

4518
03:20:23.311 --> 03:20:25.410
<v Speaker 5>story seems like a crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4519
03:20:25.470 --> 03:20:26.303
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even talking to me who's experienced a </v>

4520
03:20:28.591 --> 03:20:29.850
<v Speaker 5>bunch of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4521
03:20:29.851 --> 03:20:31.590
<v Speaker 5>and I've experienced a bunch of shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>with you.</v>

4522
03:20:31.591 --> 03:20:32.460
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you're not,</v>

4523
03:20:33.050 --> 03:20:37.080
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just relaying this very odd thing</v>

4524
03:20:37.081 --> 03:20:39.630
<v Speaker 5>that very few people who are ever going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be able to relate to right now,</v>

4525
03:20:39.990 --> 03:20:42.900
<v Speaker 5>but one day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one day it'll be real common and I think</v>

4526
03:20:42.901 --> 03:20:44.330
<v Speaker 5>it's more common now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think when you,</v>

4527
03:20:44.331 --> 03:20:45.164
<v Speaker 5>you saying this now way more common,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you talk about Iowasca and people </v>

4528
03:20:48.931 --> 03:20:51.300
<v Speaker 5>understand what you're saying then?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just 10 15 years ago,</v>

4529
03:20:51.660 --> 03:20:52.490
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

4530
03:20:52.490 --> 03:20:53.091
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no doubt.</v>

4531
03:20:53.091 --> 03:20:55.760
<v Speaker 3>Because people have had similar </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences of reference.</v>

4532
03:20:55.761 --> 03:20:56.594
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the way that a lot of people </v>

4533
03:20:58.131 --> 03:20:58.964
<v Speaker 3>experience this is in archetypes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you learn about and there's a different </v>

4534
03:21:01.761 --> 03:21:03.290
<v Speaker 3>character in the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4535
03:21:03.320 --> 03:21:06.140
<v Speaker 3>which something you can learn from like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Harry Potter movies,</v>

4536
03:21:06.141 --> 03:21:06.590
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4537
03:21:06.590 --> 03:21:08.240
<v Speaker 3>like Jordan was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4538
03:21:08.241 --> 03:21:11.930
<v Speaker 3>you can learn from those archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's different when you know,</v>

4539
03:21:11.990 --> 03:21:16.370
<v Speaker 3>you get a chance to play as the main </v>
<v Speaker 3>character playing is the main character.</v>

4540
03:21:16.371 --> 03:21:19.010
<v Speaker 3>It gives you a whole different series of</v>
<v Speaker 3>lessons.</v>

4541
03:21:19.011 --> 03:21:21.770
<v Speaker 3>Like none of these themes that came up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4542
03:21:21.771 --> 03:21:24.350
<v Speaker 3>our original themes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are all deep archetypes.</v>

4543
03:21:24.351 --> 03:21:26.600
<v Speaker 3>Even fucking the Lord of the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the stone,</v>

4544
03:21:26.730 --> 03:21:29.210
<v Speaker 3>it was a stone of such evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does it be destroyed?</v>

4545
03:21:29.211 --> 03:21:31.310
<v Speaker 3>It destroyed in the fire from whence it </v>
<v Speaker 3>came,</v>

4546
03:21:31.490 --> 03:21:32.323
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of creation created in concentrated </v>

4547
03:21:34.280 --> 03:21:36.650
<v Speaker 3>and there was dissolved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think about it then,</v>

4548
03:21:36.651 --> 03:21:38.570
<v Speaker 3>but I could see the analogies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see the,</v>

4549
03:21:38.860 --> 03:21:40.400
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the deal with the devil.</v>

4550
03:21:40.401 --> 03:21:41.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

4551
03:21:41.180 --> 03:21:44.810
<v Speaker 3>that I'll trade my soul for this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see these archetypal,</v>

4552
03:21:45.290 --> 03:21:46.100
<v Speaker 3>but you</v>

4553
03:21:46.100 --> 03:21:48.410
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can watch as many faust places I want.</v>

4554
03:21:48.680 --> 03:21:50.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm never going to feel what that feels </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4555
03:21:50.540 --> 03:21:51.373
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Until I have the devil mocking me for </v>

4556
03:21:52.671 --> 03:21:55.910
<v Speaker 4>being a coward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for not being willing to make that deal.</v>

4557
03:21:56.240 --> 03:21:58.430
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you understand these certain,</v>

4558
03:21:58.880 --> 03:22:00.740
<v Speaker 4>these certain things in a much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much deeper way.</v>

4559
03:22:00.741 --> 03:22:01.850
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

4560
03:22:01.940 --> 03:22:03.080
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the value.</v>

4561
03:22:03.081 --> 03:22:06.350
<v Speaker 4>It just puts you up in this situation </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you're,</v>

4562
03:22:06.500 --> 03:22:09.110
<v Speaker 4>you have stake in the game and you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>choices to make,</v>

4563
03:22:09.470 --> 03:22:10.303
<v Speaker 4>and that's where you get the real value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Roger Huerta would've put that </v>

4564
03:22:13.070 --> 03:22:13.903
<v Speaker 4>world crushing in a Thai clinch and </v>
<v Speaker 4>slash or right into is fucking stupid </v>

4565
03:22:16.431 --> 03:22:18.740
<v Speaker 4>phase for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's part of it.</v>

4566
03:22:18.741 --> 03:22:19.880
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the Shamans,</v>

4567
03:22:19.881 --> 03:22:20.990
<v Speaker 4>that's their move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4568
03:22:20.991 --> 03:22:25.010
<v Speaker 4>They're constantly trying to get mastery</v>
<v Speaker 4>and dominion over all of these things.</v>

4569
03:22:25.011 --> 03:22:25.844
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just find that the more you try and </v>

4570
03:22:26.571 --> 03:22:28.670
<v Speaker 4>fight with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more they just love it.</v>

4571
03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:31.190
<v Speaker 4>Do you like whatever thing you're trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fight,</v>

4572
03:22:31.191 --> 03:22:32.540
<v Speaker 4>whatever darkness you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>

4573
03:22:32.541 --> 03:22:34.190
<v Speaker 4>the more you fight with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Asker and like they got the drop on you,</v>

4578
03:22:41.481 --> 03:22:42.314
<v Speaker 4>but the minute you change the game and </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognize them as an important part and </v>

4579
03:22:45.171 --> 03:22:47.420
<v Speaker 4>send them love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when the conflict ends.</v>
