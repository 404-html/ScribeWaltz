<v Speaker 1>it doesn't bother him until he did.</v>

6
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.141
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

7
00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.610
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't get embarrassed,</v>

8
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.503
<v Speaker 1>but he has to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're learning on this show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

59

<v Speaker 1>this is a show of it.</v>

60
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Mind,</v>

61
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.660
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty more where that goes.</v>

62
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the smartest coyote is smarter than the dumbest person?</v>

63
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's deep.</v>

66
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.200
<v Speaker 1>That's deep.</v>

67
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

68
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

69
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:42.601
<v Speaker 1>they live in places,</v>

70
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if I could live there.</v>

71
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

72
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>So now what city has,</v>

73
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>is there any city in the country that actually has a legitimate problem with</v>

75
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:51.324
<v Speaker 1>coyotes?</v>

76
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Depends.</v>

77
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Have you talked to,</v>

78
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

79
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.731
<v Speaker 1>La,</v>

80
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>we definitely have our issues,</v>

81
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.381
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

82
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's been bites.</v>

83
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>There's been other situations been bitten.</v>

84
00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Elysian park had some bites.</v>

87
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 1>There's been bites down in Orange County.</v>

88
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>It had some bites.</v>

89
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Are they biting homeless people?</v>

90
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:06.901
<v Speaker 1>Are they biting?</v>

91
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>People would take naps.</v>

92
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>What are the,</v>

93
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>what do I do?</v>

94
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

95
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>it's all over the board.</v>

96
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Usually it seems to be tied to people been feeding it and so it's almost coming</v>

97
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:16.200
<v Speaker 1>up and biting like people on the hands or people on the leg.</v>

98
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

99
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think any of them know.</v>

100
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>The ones I've heard had been like where they're trying to take the person down</v>

101
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.531
<v Speaker 1>real type thing.</v>

102
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 1>They've all been more like where they're coming up and none of them,</v>

103
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>none of them have.</v>

104
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

105
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Do you heard about that woman who was a folk singer in Canada?</v>

106
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>They got killed a couple of years back by coyotes.</v>

107
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

108
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>I actually went up there a couple of years after that.</v>

109
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>They actually got a study going on,</v>

110
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:36.541
<v Speaker 1>coyotes up there.</v>

111
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:39.510
<v Speaker 1>They radio collared a bunch and I went up there and helped him capture or the</v>

112
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>first couple of animals to kind of see what's going on and that's just a crazy</v>

113
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>scenario up there.</v>

114
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>It's way different than what we see down here.</v>

115
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.980
<v Speaker 1>The coyotes first or there eastern coyotes,</v>

116
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>so they're a little bit bigger,</v>

117
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.921
<v Speaker 1>but they're also,</v>

118
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:50.170
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

119
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>they kind of,</v>

120
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>there's very few food sources up there.</v>

121
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>They're dealing with snowshoe hares,</v>

122
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>which their cycles kind of fluctuate up and down.</v>

123
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes there can be tons of food and other times there can be almost</v>

124
00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>none,</v>

125
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>but they've learned that they can take advantage of Moose during the winter and</v>

126
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>they're actually killing Moose in the snow.</v>

127
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>What you'd think of this little 40 pound animal,</v>

128
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>take it on this huge moose,</v>

129
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.441
<v Speaker 1>but they're seeing it.</v>

130
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>They do these snow surveys and they're finding these dead moose that were very</v>

131
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>clearly killed by coyotes.</v>

132
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.141
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

133
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>So a full grown Mousse.</v>

134
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

135
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

136
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

137
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 1>A full grown moose is like more than a thousand pounds.</v>

138
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

140
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.911
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

141
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:25.101
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

142
00:03:25.101 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

143
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

144
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>obviously these moose in the winter,</v>

145
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>the snow gets deep,</v>

146
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>so there they're definitely,</v>

147
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>they can get stuck in things and that type of scenario would they know that it's</v>

148
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>coyotes and killed them and not wolves.</v>

149
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.330

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.431
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

254
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I gathered everybody around.</v>

255
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I just appointed a bathroom monitor and oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a bathroom monitors.</v>

257
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.170

258
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I had a clipboard.</v>

259
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.630
<v Speaker 1>I put a lock on the map room door and then she,</v>

260
00:06:34.631 --> 00:06:36.080
<v Speaker 1>you become this corporate fixer.</v>

261
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was doing.</v>

262
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 4>Story that didn't,</v>

263
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 4>that we engaged in.</v>

264
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:41.271
<v Speaker 4>That's famous.</v>

265
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 4>That's not about this journey.</v>

266
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you an example.</v>

267
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.121
<v Speaker 4>The protocol.</v>

268
00:06:45.121 --> 00:06:45.954
<v Speaker 4>Sound</v>

269
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.870
<v Speaker 4>parable question seems religious doesn't really make much sense.</v>

270
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.933
<v Speaker 4>Do you know the story?</v>

271
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.551
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

272
00:06:53.551 --> 00:06:54.630
<v Speaker 4>But why don't you lay it out?</v>

273
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.370
<v Speaker 4>So there's a father,</v>

274
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.230
<v Speaker 4>he has two sons and oldest son,</v>

275
00:06:58.231 --> 00:06:59.064
<v Speaker 4>the younger son,</v>

276
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.420
<v Speaker 4>and he says to them,</v>

277
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.430
<v Speaker 4>who wants to spend their inheritance?</v>

278
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.530
<v Speaker 4>The younger says me that don't go and spend it,</v>

279
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.390
<v Speaker 4>and the youngest son takes all the dough and he runs off and sniffs coke off</v>

280
00:07:09.391 --> 00:07:14.391
<v Speaker 4>stripper's tits for a number of years until he realizes this is getting pretty</v>

281
00:07:15.721 --> 00:07:17.400
<v Speaker 4>boring and I'm in a lot of trouble.</v>

282
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.080
<v Speaker 4>He ends up feeding,</v>

283
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.090
<v Speaker 4>throwing food to pigs.</v>

284
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.953
<v Speaker 4>That's his job.</v>

285
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.160
<v Speaker 4>And he can't even eat the food that he gives to the pigs.</v>

286
00:07:26.161 --> 00:07:27.090
<v Speaker 4>At which point he says,</v>

287
00:07:27.091 --> 00:07:27.361
<v Speaker 4>Dad,</v>

288
00:07:27.361 --> 00:07:28.320
<v Speaker 4>will you take me back?</v>

289
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.400
<v Speaker 4>That then goes to,</v>

290
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.353
<v Speaker 4>they don't meet.</v>

291
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.340
<v Speaker 4>This somehow happens.</v>

292
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.750
<v Speaker 4>Not through telephones.</v>

293
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.950
<v Speaker 4>It just happens at which point that goes to the fatty carbs has killed the</v>

294
00:07:40.951 --> 00:07:41.784
<v Speaker 4>fatted calf.</v>

295
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.290
<v Speaker 4>Oldest sons hustled on that.</v>

296
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.173
<v Speaker 4>What's going on?</v>

297
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.770
<v Speaker 4>I've stayed with you since the beginning.</v>

298
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.800
<v Speaker 4>I've been loyal to you and I hear the stories of my younger brother coming back</v>

299
00:07:52.021 --> 00:07:54.870
<v Speaker 4>who's been sniffing coke off stripper's tits for the last topic on those how</v>

300
00:07:54.871 --> 00:07:57.840
<v Speaker 4>many years and you're prepared to kill the fatted calf.</v>

301
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.300
<v Speaker 4>W what's the SP that I want another story.</v>

302
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:01.951
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

303
00:08:01.951 --> 00:08:02.550
<v Speaker 4>you're right son.</v>

304
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.383
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry about that.</v>

305
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.980
<v Speaker 4>You take a little side step,</v>

306
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.791
<v Speaker 4>a little step to the side.</v>

307
00:08:05.791 --> 00:08:06.421
<v Speaker 4>You'll always be with me.</v>

308
00:08:06.421 --> 00:08:07.254
<v Speaker 4>You're a good boy.</v>

309
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.260
<v Speaker 4>At which point he goes out to meet the protocol son,</v>

310
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.243
<v Speaker 4>the wasteful son.</v>

311
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.660
<v Speaker 4>The waste will some returns and he says you will awesome that you're found.</v>

312
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.030
<v Speaker 4>That's the end of the story</v>

313
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.200
<v Speaker 4>is quite hard to make sense of that in a literal sense.</v>

314
00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:23.980
<v Speaker 4>You go all dance was a bit unfair.</v>

315
00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:24.091
<v Speaker 4>Me,</v>

316
00:08:24.091 --> 00:08:27.540
<v Speaker 4>you should have been kind to the oldest son cause he never ran off and did</v>

317
00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:28.374
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

318
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.110
<v Speaker 4>But the essence of the story is that you are the father.</v>

319
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.400
<v Speaker 4>You are enough.</v>

320
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.540
<v Speaker 4>Your oldest son is your intellect.</v>

321
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:42.381
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

322
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:42.591
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

323
00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:43.071
<v Speaker 4>don't do this.</v>

324
00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:43.904
<v Speaker 4>Don't do that.</v>

325
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to reconcile,</v>

326
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:47.690
<v Speaker 4>make sense of a prosaic and material world.</v>

327
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:53.410
<v Speaker 4>The younger son being the wild feral entity that he is.</v>

328
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 4>What's going out in the to find out what it's all about.</v>

329
00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

330
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.060
<v Speaker 4>So when he's recklessness and sense of adventure,</v>

331
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.060
<v Speaker 4>he finds that he can't escape himself.</v>

332
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 4>So we has to return to himself and at which point he has to accept who he is,</v>

333
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.130
<v Speaker 4>which point the intellect is left out.</v>

334
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 4>The equation pretty much is the older brother because he can't understand the</v>

335
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:23.010
<v Speaker 4>significance of the journey of the wasteful brother.</v>

336
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.263
<v Speaker 4>Any end,</v>

337
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.660
<v Speaker 4>you have to leave yourself to understand the value of yourself.</v>

338
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.930
<v Speaker 4>You have to lose stuff before you realize that all the stuff that you're losing</v>

339
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.170
<v Speaker 4>is a femoral and transitory.</v>

340
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.013
<v Speaker 4>It's not yours.</v>

341
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 4>You are enough.</v>

342
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 4>You are always enough,</v>

343
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 4>but you've got to somehow prostitute yourself before you realize your own value</v>

344
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.810
<v Speaker 4>factors is the essence of all stories.</v>
