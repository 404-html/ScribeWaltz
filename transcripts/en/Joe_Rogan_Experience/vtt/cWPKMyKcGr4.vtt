1
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they are friends.</v>

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what's troubling to the American</v>

3
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:15.441
<v Speaker 1>Jewish community troubling to me is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think there's been a change of strategy.</v>

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>And I think that comes as a result of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that,</v>

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States today is facing a</v>

6
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>major challenge in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not Russia,</v>

7
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not Chavez.</v>

8
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:29.244
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>it's the Arab Muslim world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're at war America's at war with two</v>

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Muslim countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We baby at warroad a third.</v>

11
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all Muslims are terrorists,</v>

12
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:44.871
<v Speaker 1>but most artists are Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a major challenge for the U S and,</v>

13
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're seeing in this</v>

14
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 1>administration is an effort to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

15
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of that effort is this</v>
<v Speaker 1>notion of linkage that if you could only</v>

16
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>solve the Arab Israel conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Messiah will come in the Middle East.</v>

17
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>And it's that notion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that analysis that is motivating</v>

18
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>American policy.</v>

19
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah I think friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think when the president went to</v>

21
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:20.661
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East is stumble Cairo Rehab</v>
<v Speaker 1>three times he was in a neighborhood of</v>

22
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't visit Jerusalem,</v>

23
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>sent the wrong message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sent a message that we're reaching out</v>

24
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>to the Arab Muslim world at the expense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our friendship or relationship with</v>

25
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been focusing on settlements</v>

26
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:39.681
<v Speaker 1>without focusing on Palestinian</v>
<v Speaker 1>incitement and stuff was another</v>

27
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think what we're seeing is a policy</v>

28
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.840
<v Speaker 1>which sees itself distancing the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States from Israel in order to reach out</v>

29
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>and in some manner to the Arab Muslim</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

30
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so many of the Jewish community have</v>

31
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:05.091
<v Speaker 1>been concerned that this nuance or non</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuance changed as is as is.</v>

32
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>And I believe as I indicated earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is hurting prospects.</v>

33
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 1>That piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause if Israel does not feel that it's</v>

34
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>only ally continues to be its friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>event,</v>

35
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 1>it will not risk.</v>

36
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>It will not compromise to the extent</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it has.</v>

37
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>And if you take a look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and during the Bush administration,</v>

38
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 1>whether you like Bush or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first president to come out for a</v>

39
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Palestinian state with Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

40
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Because Israel trusted him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

41
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharon trusted him to the point that</v>

42
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:43.960
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when President Bush announced appellate</v>

43
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>that America's for a Palestinian state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prime minister,</v>

44
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Sharon leftist political party because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were opposed,</v>

45
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disengagement from Gaza happened under</v>

46
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.790
<v Speaker 1>the Annapolis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when it's closer,</v>

48
00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:03.510
<v Speaker 1>now we have no talks and in Palestinians</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Israelis are talking through</v>

49
00:03:03.511 --> 00:03:06.510
<v Speaker 1>proximity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is their 15 kilometers away,</v>

50
00:03:06.511 --> 00:03:09.720
<v Speaker 1>nine miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've got to talk through the United</v>

51
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.720
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
