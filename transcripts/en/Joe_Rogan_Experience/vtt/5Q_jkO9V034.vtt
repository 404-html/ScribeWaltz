<v Speaker 1>directing comedy specials.</v>

36
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.500
<v Speaker 2>That was a fun one because it was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>just such a.</v>

37
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 2>immediately I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be in the O and nobody filmed</v>

38
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:39.310
<v Speaker 2>in the OA and so like getting everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>to agree to that.</v>

39
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then because he would spike was</v>

40
00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:44.950
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the main rooms right here so big and</v>

41
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:45.784
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

42

<v Speaker 2>the main room is pretty good too.</v>

44
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be prejudice against the main</v>

45
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:54.331
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too big.</v>

47
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.450
<v Speaker 2>It's too showy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how dirty and grimy.</v>

48
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 2>It depends on like the sides of full or</v>
<v Speaker 2>open and what the,</v>

49
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.950
<v Speaker 2>the room can change depending on so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>factors of like seeding and whatever.</v>

50
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Just the sound of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

51
00:02:11.321 --> 00:02:14.020
<v Speaker 2>the room really changes when it gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>empty late at night.</v>

52
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a strange room.</v>

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 2>he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

165
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.920

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:07:40.921 --> 00:07:45.921
<v Speaker 2>operating from such a place of just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so it had to be honest to him I</v>

167
00:07:47.851 --> 00:07:51.840
<v Speaker 2>think and it had just hadn't gone up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a while and was on stage and was just</v>

168
00:07:51.841 --> 00:07:55.900
<v Speaker 2>like in the room and just sat in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

169
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.620
<v Speaker 2>he just sat there was footage is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Send me that.</v>

170
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got the footage.</v>

171
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Well it's in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see it in a documentary like a</v>

172
00:08:03.271 --> 00:08:04.860
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's extended for it.</v>

173
00:08:04.861 --> 00:08:08.130
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen the extended footage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that exists,</v>

174
00:08:08.131 --> 00:08:08.964
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

175
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.420
<v Speaker 1>there's some great old cassettes that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>bought from a,</v>

176
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:18.630
<v Speaker 1>like a gas station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were a red foxes comedy club.</v>

177
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Red Fox had a comedy club and prior</v>
<v Speaker 1>would go up and just fuck around man,</v>

178
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.210
<v Speaker 1>just fuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was many of them.</v>

179
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was like seven or eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>recordings.</v>

180
00:08:30.371 --> 00:08:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Mavericks flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was right.</v>

181
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.530
<v Speaker 1>That was the name of the company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so awful.</v>

182
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.140
<v Speaker 1>It was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like crenshaw or something over there.</v>

183
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the club was?</v>

184
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

185
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I got them when I was living in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living in Boston and I found them</v>

186
00:08:44.981 --> 00:08:47.020
<v Speaker 1>like at a gas station there were for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sale.</v>

187
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was crazy because it was like,</v>

188
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.260
<v Speaker 1>it was a small crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell it was a small crowd and</v>

189
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>prior was just fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just,</v>

190
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.550
<v Speaker 1>he was ad libbing.</v>

191
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.800
<v Speaker 1>You could tell that like it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>structured and some of it was really</v>

192
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:06.330
<v Speaker 1>funny and some of it like kind of fell</v>
<v Speaker 1>flat and you could hear the clink of</v>

193
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.960
<v Speaker 1>glasses and shit in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just so real rich,</v>

194
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Pryor back then he was doing</v>

195
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:19.611
<v Speaker 1>something that it's like he had figured</v>
<v Speaker 1>out a thing that he could do that other</v>

196
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:21.760
<v Speaker 1>people hadn't figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that thing was like,</v>

197
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.780
<v Speaker 1>just be totally honest and also just</v>
<v Speaker 1>explore ideas on stage in front of</v>

198
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:30.810
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not even have it mapped out yet.</v>

199
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Just try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fuck around and find what's funny</v>

200
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.210
<v Speaker 1>and he'd be smoking cigarettes and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking and he figured out a way to turn</v>

201
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 1>and then you would see it boiled in to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Richard Pryor live or live in the</v>

202
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:45.660
<v Speaker 1>sunset strip or any of his specials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would see it boiled down to this,</v>

203
00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.270
<v Speaker 2>doing it for tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

204
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.470
<v Speaker 2>he performed for television really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

205
00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.110
<v Speaker 2>and that's kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an element that,</v>

206
00:09:56.111 --> 00:09:59.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people kind of forget that.</v>

207
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Like how well of a it connected with you</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching it at home,</v>

208
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.160
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

209
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.110
<v Speaker 2>even me 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years later after it's filmed and</v>

210
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:16.111
<v Speaker 2>just watching it with my dad if he plays</v>
<v Speaker 2>really well here,</v>

211
00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.520
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to you,</v>

212
00:10:18.521 --> 00:10:21.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like you can feel how personal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how honest it is.</v>

213
00:10:21.701 --> 00:10:24.490
<v Speaker 2>And so when it was like boiled down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>

214
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.490
<v Speaker 2>he was also captured really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever see him live?</v>

215
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.140
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prior?</v>

216
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old do you think I am?</v>

217
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.130
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was alive doing standup 10 years ago?</v>

218
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little bit more maybe 15 years</v>

219
00:10:38.091 --> 00:10:38.980
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he doesn't,</v>

220
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:43.850
<v Speaker 1>he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was more than 15 years ago now</v>

221
00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:45.500
<v Speaker 1>that I'm thinking about it is you ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen him live?</v>

222
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had um,</v>

223
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.700
<v Speaker 1>I had a follow them like five weeks in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>row,</v>

224
00:10:49.701 --> 00:10:50.620
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really Weird.</v>

225
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Like a run in 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died.</v>

226
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was more than I thought</v>

227
00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:00.410
<v Speaker 1>he did a run before he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was probably right before then.</v>

228
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.610
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was like the late</v>

229
00:11:04.611 --> 00:11:06.150
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early 2000,</v>

230
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:10.190
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around that he was real sick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would have to carry him to the</v>

231
00:11:10.191 --> 00:11:13.880
<v Speaker 1>stage and it would take like five</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes for him to get to the stage so</v>

232
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.610
<v Speaker 1>that he introduced him and the comic</v>
<v Speaker 1>would get out of the way.</v>

233
00:11:16.611 --> 00:11:17.520
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

234
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.940
<v Speaker 1>a chewy and Maryland Martinez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his husband would help him,</v>

235
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.430
<v Speaker 1>walked the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would hold onto him,</v>

236
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.260
<v Speaker 1>take him to the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me take forever.</v>

237
00:11:27.261 --> 00:11:30.470
<v Speaker 1>It was a slow process and they'd get</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they sit them down and they'd</v>

238
00:11:30.471 --> 00:11:35.471
<v Speaker 1>crank up the mic like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>because his voice was so soft.</v>

239
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he would do standup,</v>

240
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.940
<v Speaker 1>do like 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes and then I would go on after</v>

241
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.740
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost every time it would be me and</v>

242
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:49.010
<v Speaker 1>just eat shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

243
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody</v>

244
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.500
<v Speaker 3>knew who I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And second of all they just saw Richard</v>

245
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.770
<v Speaker 3>Pryor and they're sad because he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fading away.</v>

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.510
<v Speaker 3>You're right in front of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

247
00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:06.220
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting feeling like never</v>
<v Speaker 3>before it was like a British type in</v>

248
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:09.910
<v Speaker 3>admission,</v>

<v Speaker 3>two nights before our first time I went</v>

<v Speaker 3>the whole show.</v>

262
00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.210

263
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.343
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

264
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 3>That's an experience man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

265
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.940
<v Speaker 3>the people that do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

266
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.140
<v Speaker 3>that's like running an ultra marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

267
00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.890
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I am to,</v>

268
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.010
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

269
00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:00.960
<v Speaker 3>I can watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can watch it,</v>

270
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can consume a,</v>

271
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:09.150
<v Speaker 2>like a high volume of it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of cases.</v>

272
00:13:09.151 --> 00:13:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

273
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been interested in like</v>

274
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.340
<v Speaker 2>whatever people are talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

275
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.470
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was just an interesting sampler.</v>

276
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.333
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

277
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.290
<v Speaker 3>what's fascinating about the store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

278
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:24.220
<v Speaker 3>the 15 minute blocks that you're seeing</v>
<v Speaker 3>these completely different viewpoints,</v>

279
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.060
<v Speaker 3>15 minute chunks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like if you sit there for long</v>

280
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:30.250
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sit there for a couple of hours and</v>

281
00:13:30.251 --> 00:13:32.950
<v Speaker 3>you watched that many different people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to eight different people go</v>

282
00:13:32.951 --> 00:13:33.400
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

283
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.780
<v Speaker 3>it's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

284
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:41.150
<v Speaker 2>the strength of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for like what standup is</v>

285
00:13:41.971 --> 00:13:45.240
<v Speaker 2>especially like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it helps is it allows you to think</v>

286
00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:48.240
<v Speaker 2>of yourself in context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

287
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.390
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's Kinda,</v>

288
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.260
<v Speaker 2>that's best more important now than</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

289
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Especially what stand up if you're on</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're competing against the 3000</v>

290
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.920
<v Speaker 2>other specials that came out this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

291
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.150
<v Speaker 2>It's in context of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

292
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:09.210
<v Speaker 2>kind of mass consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you go into a,</v>

293
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of a marathon,</v>

294
00:14:11.221 --> 00:14:12.450
<v Speaker 2>so you're going up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

295
00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:17.451
<v Speaker 2>are in the middle of a show and they saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight comics for you.</v>

296
00:14:17.911 --> 00:14:20.900
<v Speaker 2>They'll see nine after you or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

297
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:26.420
<v Speaker 2>You have to like kind of sketch a place</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their minds in context of everything</v>

298
00:14:28.351 --> 00:14:31.260
<v Speaker 2>else that they saw that night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's really important.</v>

299
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Are you going like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you going like,</v>

300
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:34.400
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what happened?</v>

301
00:14:34.401 --> 00:14:35.420
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>

302
00:14:35.421 --> 00:14:36.810
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

303
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.010
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

304
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.020
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it forces you.</v>

305
00:14:39.021 --> 00:14:40.830
<v Speaker 3>It's not saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

306
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:45.110
<v Speaker 3>it's not saying change who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it makes them more dynamic</v>

307
00:14:45.111 --> 00:14:50.111
<v Speaker 3>version of who you are because you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be memorable in the context of all of</v>

308
00:14:50.361 --> 00:14:52.360
<v Speaker 3>these people and these different styles.</v>

309
00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.780
<v Speaker 2>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

310
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 2>I think what you do because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you make and you release into</v>

311
00:14:57.651 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are also releasing it in the context</v>

312
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 2>of other are that people are consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

313
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 2>So like even if you release your standup</v>
<v Speaker 2>album,</v>

314
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times people will buy stand up</v>

315
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:10.730
<v Speaker 2>albums by stand up albums,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

316
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:15.110
<v Speaker 2>and so they listened to you in context</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the other standup albums that you</v>

317
00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:17.750
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a strong comparison.</v>

318
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:22.751
<v Speaker 2>Culture stand has right like hip hop</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's always in relation.</v>

319
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:26.750
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my favorite rapper is this is</v>

320
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:31.751
<v Speaker 2>better than that wrapper</v>
<v Speaker 2>and comedians and consumers of it,</v>

321
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of association so it's like</v>

322
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:41.290
<v Speaker 2>you should force you to be you</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically you that's needed more than</v>

323
00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:44.280
<v Speaker 2>ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

324
00:15:44.281 --> 00:15:47.720
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you need to be yourself completely</v>

325
00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:52.100
<v Speaker 2>or if you're a character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that character needs to be hammered the</v>

326
00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:52.934
<v Speaker 2>fuck down.</v>

327
00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who you are changes depending upon</v>

328
00:15:55.831 --> 00:15:57.690
<v Speaker 1>your environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things about the</v>

329
00:15:57.691 --> 00:15:59.940
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like since I've come back to the store,</v>

330
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.150
<v Speaker 1>it's tightened me up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's made me better coming back to the</v>

331
00:16:03.151 --> 00:16:05.970
<v Speaker 1>store because it's like being in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

332
00:16:05.971 --> 00:16:09.120
<v Speaker 1>being in that pressure cooker with</v>
<v Speaker 1>around all these other creative people</v>

333
00:16:09.121 --> 00:16:10.590
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's constantly getting after</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

334
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

335
00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:13.300
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really good,</v>

336
00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:19.240
<v Speaker 2>a kind of artist's colony at his best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can operate like that.</v>

337
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.310
<v Speaker 2>You can just kind of run them on his</v>
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>

338
00:16:21.311 --> 00:16:26.311
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember nights where we would</v>
<v Speaker 2>run in between rooms even before getting</v>

339
00:16:27.251 --> 00:16:30.040
<v Speaker 2>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just to go see each,</v>

340
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:30.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each room,</v>

341
00:16:30.941 --> 00:16:34.520
<v Speaker 2>different comedians and you just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>absorb it and watch it and get excited.</v>

342
00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do three different sets in</v>

343
00:16:36.121 --> 00:16:37.890
<v Speaker 1>that place and have three different</v>
<v Speaker 1>universes.</v>

344
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Like you're in the belly room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're in the main room and the,</v>

345
00:16:40.411 --> 00:16:41.880
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are those three different world?</v>

346
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.790
<v Speaker 1>There really are three completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>different entities.</v>

347
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.520
<v Speaker 1>It changes people too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's one of the reasons why</v>

348
00:16:47.521 --> 00:16:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Kennison became who he was because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing those late night spots.</v>

349
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.170
<v Speaker 1>He was doing those same spots at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holtzman gets those,</v>

350
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.790
<v Speaker 1>those late spots and he just had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>capture people's attention.</v>

351
00:16:56.791 --> 00:17:00.630
<v Speaker 1>So He'd just go out there screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're really,</v>

400
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.880
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he just wanted to know that he</v>

401
00:19:17.881 --> 00:19:21.650
<v Speaker 3>would shoot them all coked out of his</v>

<v Speaker 3>Comedians were.</v>

432
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.080
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was like people who go on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tonight show and they have their</v>

433
00:20:47.081 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 3>sleeves rolled up,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but it never seemed like me.</v>

437
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.510
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't see myself doing it.</v>

438
00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:01.560
<v Speaker 2>People got to stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got to stop doing that.</v>

439
00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Like why are you doing the tonight show</v>
<v Speaker 2>set in your Kobe's not even they blocked</v>

440
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:13.990
<v Speaker 2>is so fucking disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They block shoot these things we use</v>

441
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.000
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

442
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.330
<v Speaker 2>they'll do like 10 comedians at a time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's not even there and they like</v>

443

444
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:23.950

<v Speaker 2>it's the rudest thing I've ever heard</v>

445
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:29.220
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that comedians still go on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the show and would still do it is insane</v>

446
00:21:30.371 --> 00:21:31.360
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>front of this audience in the studio and</v>

452
00:21:43.901 --> 00:21:47.470
<v Speaker 2>pretends to throw the yellow arrows to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like you're there and it's like this</v>

453
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:49.170
<v Speaker 2>thing that's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course they're going to do that.</v>

458
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:58.810
<v Speaker 2>They're going to do that to any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

459
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.400
<v Speaker 2>any John Rowe entertainment that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow such a thing to happen,</v>

460
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.940
<v Speaker 2>they will do it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

461
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to do Rhianna's doing,</v>

462
00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:09.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

463
00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:12.100
<v Speaker 2>these things are so contrived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's the same set.</v>

464
00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:13.510
<v Speaker 2>You come out in front of the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>curtain.</v>

465
00:22:13.511 --> 00:22:17.290
<v Speaker 2>People put on the same outfit that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't wear yesterday and would never</v>

466
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:20.980
<v Speaker 2>wear again tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they come out and they pretend to be</v>

467
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:23.320
<v Speaker 2>a comedian from 1993.</v>

468
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.940
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck are you?</v>

469
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you fucking doing for a set to</v>

470
00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:36.170
<v Speaker 2>get passed around to a couple of agents</v>
<v Speaker 2>that want to come see you?</v>

471
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to the avant about this.</v>

472
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.570
<v Speaker 2>We were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about like whether it's</v>

473
00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:45.650
<v Speaker 2>worth it being on one of those shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

474
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.593
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never.</v>

475
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.850
<v Speaker 2>It's never worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never worth it.</v>

476
00:22:48.851 --> 00:22:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Capturing yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as yourself.</v>

477
00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a waste of your time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Used to be worth something.</v>

478
00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.640
<v Speaker 2>This is why it's confusing because there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was no venues before.</v>

479
00:22:57.641 --> 00:22:59.770
<v Speaker 2>So when Johnny Carson would have you on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tonight show.</v>

480
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

481
00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was a listening.</v>

482
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:07.030
<v Speaker 2>It served its purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very important at the time it was</v>

483
00:23:07.031 --> 00:23:12.031
<v Speaker 2>an outlet where there weren't a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>outlets and now those types of fuck are</v>

484
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:12.920
<v Speaker 2>we doing?</v>

485
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially unless it's like know with</v>

486
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.530
<v Speaker 2>that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

487
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Kimmel built,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he built like a club,</v>

488
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.780
<v Speaker 2>like to enhance the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>travel from the studio to the club and</v>

489
00:23:25.781 --> 00:23:27.250
<v Speaker 2>the comedians would do it there and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

490
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.870
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like an effort.</v>

491
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.090
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like an effort to create.</v>

492
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a space,</v>

493
00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:35.330
<v Speaker 2>a separate studio that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

494
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I believe this will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I've seen like a Kennel</v>

495
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.780
<v Speaker 2>set sand upset recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

496
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.510
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

497
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.180
<v Speaker 2>there was like an effort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

498
00:23:43.181 --> 00:23:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I've always really appreciated that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

499
00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

500
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least try like I don't know,</v>

501
00:23:50.691 --> 00:23:54.140
<v Speaker 2>just try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are too many options for comedians</v>

502
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:57.950
<v Speaker 2>to go through the same filter of</v>
<v Speaker 2>capturing themselves,</v>

503
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that's not authentic to them.</v>

504
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:02.810
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying that if I go on called</v>
<v Speaker 2>bear,</v>

505
00:24:02.811 --> 00:24:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I should do with my shirt off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to have his shirt off,</v>

506
00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.670
<v Speaker 2>it has a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

507
00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:08.580
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you should,</v>

508
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.980
<v Speaker 2>you should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do have regular set in the belly room.</v>

509
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean because it's like,</v>

510
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if standup is art,</v>

511
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:21.973
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's,</v>

512
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:27.020
<v Speaker 2>if it is an art form then it's supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be like the medium is supposed to</v>

513
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:30.320
<v Speaker 2>come to the artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not the other way around,</v>

514
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because even even on those same shows,</v>

515
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you see a live music performance,</v>

516
00:24:36.471 --> 00:24:39.650
<v Speaker 2>like the stagings different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's specific to the audience,</v>

517
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the context of a show in a black</v>

518
00:24:42.471 --> 00:24:46.460
<v Speaker 2>production and you have this space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fill it in the way that makes sense</v>

519
00:24:46.461 --> 00:24:50.830
<v Speaker 2>to the artist and then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up.</v>

520
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.350
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just go through a slide show.</v>

521
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Just the exact same think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

522
00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.200
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess when the music</v>

523
00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.610
<v Speaker 1>artists gets on Colbert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those shows,</v>

524
00:25:00.611 --> 00:25:02.230
<v Speaker 1>they're already kind of famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

525
00:25:02.231 --> 00:25:05.500
<v Speaker 1>They already have an album out and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stand up gets on those shows.</v>

526
00:25:05.501 --> 00:25:09.250
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get seen come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you don't have a special yet.</v>

527
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you just use showcased and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>picked a few people.</v>

528
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.340
<v Speaker 1>You've done any of it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do any of those.</v>

529
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specific reason.</v>

530
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never liked it.</v>

531
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.910
<v Speaker 2>I remember once on like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

532
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.990
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna do letterman while Letterman</v>

533
00:25:25.991 --> 00:25:29.740
<v Speaker 2>was on Letterman and I remember sending</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

534
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.380
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a set in or whatever,</v>

535
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.570
<v Speaker 2>and they responded was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

536
00:25:34.571 --> 00:25:35.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could do it,</v>

537
00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:40.620
<v Speaker 2>but could he do his jokes in a more</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional setup punchline format?</v>

538
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:43.180
<v Speaker 2>And I remember just like email them</v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

539
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:45.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just do it when I'm famous.</v>

540
00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not going to listen to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

541
00:25:52.331 --> 00:25:53.860
<v Speaker 2>No people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they change.</v>

542
00:25:53.861 --> 00:25:56.470
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing they change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

543
00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.580
<v Speaker 2>compare yourself to a musician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you're a musician going on and</v>

544
00:26:00.581 --> 00:26:01.630
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we liked the song,</v>

545
00:26:01.631 --> 00:26:03.580
<v Speaker 2>but cut the bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come first,</v>

546
00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.830
<v Speaker 2>and then you do the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be like,</v>

547
00:26:05.831 --> 00:26:07.780
<v Speaker 2>go fuck yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

548
00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:12.510
<v Speaker 2>And the comedians allow like you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>say pop tart if you say pop.</v>

549
00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comedians allow a Lotta Shit to say</v>

550
00:26:16.751 --> 00:26:19.960
<v Speaker 2>pastry pastry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't make any sense.</v>

551
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:24.580
<v Speaker 2>We just trying to hit the road drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toaster strudel is trying to hit the</v>

552
00:26:24.581 --> 00:26:25.660
<v Speaker 2>road right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in.</v>

553
00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Do you man</v>
<v Speaker 2>do</v>

554
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.580
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even back in the day,</v>

555
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.140
<v Speaker 1>it didn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would go,</v>

556
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.480
<v Speaker 1>you should put together a five minute</v>
<v Speaker 1>set for the tonight show,</v>

557
00:26:34.481 --> 00:26:37.360
<v Speaker 1>and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it,</v>

558
00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.680
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do it.</v>

559
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good exposure.</v>

560
00:26:40.031 --> 00:26:42.130
<v Speaker 1>This is like the fucking nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

561
00:26:42.131 --> 00:26:43.800
<v Speaker 1>When it actually probably meant I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

562
00:26:43.801 --> 00:26:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it happening.</v>

563
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing a not stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

564
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:51.144
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

565
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:56.330
<v Speaker 1>you're taking a little piece of standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a short set is 15 minutes and in 15</v>

566
00:26:56.791 --> 00:26:59.310
<v Speaker 1>minutes I might cover two concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

567
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:04.140
<v Speaker 1>any time I go over things like I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>thorough if I'm,</v>

568
00:27:04.141 --> 00:27:07.230
<v Speaker 1>if I'm talking about a subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get involved in that subject.</v>

569
00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:09.630
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to bring people on a journey and</v>

570
00:27:09.631 --> 00:27:11.160
<v Speaker 1>I also want to be able to set them up.</v>

571
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.120
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to explain how I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about things so that by the time I get</v>

572
00:27:15.121 --> 00:27:17.820
<v Speaker 1>to something controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they already have a sense of how I</v>

573
00:27:17.821 --> 00:27:20.580
<v Speaker 1>approach things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that in five minutes,</v>

574
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.820
<v Speaker 1>in five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just got to just get into it and</v>

575
00:27:23.821 --> 00:27:26.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very condensed,</v>

576
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.940
<v Speaker 1>homogenized version of who you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

577
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just do a late night spot.</v>

578
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Little five minute setup and leave just</v>
<v Speaker 1>to set up.</v>

579
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Just to set up this shake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

580
00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:43.440
<v Speaker 1>I remember I saw Louis do one Louis ck</v>
<v Speaker 1>did one,</v>

581
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.300
<v Speaker 1>one of those letterman or tonight show</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that and I was like,</v>

582
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.790
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he shouldn't even do this.</v>

583
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a.</v>

584
00:27:53.191 --> 00:27:55.800
<v Speaker 1>not a good representation of what he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of.</v>

585
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are like,</v>

586
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.830
<v Speaker 2>Jerry Seinfeld should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

587
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.340
<v Speaker 2>That he should absolutely do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

588
00:28:02.341 --> 00:28:03.190
<v Speaker 2>He could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he does,</v>

589
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:08.430
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Jerry's a tonight show sets.</v>

590
00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his like his makes sense.</v>

591
00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense.</v>

592
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.210
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like perfect for and it's like,</v>

593
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.890
<v Speaker 2>it translates very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

594
00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I watched those shows today,</v>

595
00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they still a thing when I see a</v>

596
00:28:21.551 --> 00:28:24.430
<v Speaker 1>late night show and no disrespect</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who hosts a late night show,</v>

597
00:28:24.431 --> 00:28:27.850
<v Speaker 1>but to me it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they took a boat and try to</v>

598
00:28:27.851 --> 00:28:29.940
<v Speaker 1>turn into a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

599
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.860
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey America,</v>

600
00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:35.370
<v Speaker 1>it's in 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's pretend it's not there when be</v>

601
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.180
<v Speaker 1>right back with a commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

602
00:28:37.181 --> 00:28:40.820
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercials the thing,</v>

603
00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.480
<v Speaker 1>but today everybody watches Hbo and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix.</v>

604
00:28:43.481 --> 00:28:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing here?</v>

605
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Sitting through a fucking commercial.</v>

606
00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm may be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like because I actually,</v>

607
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:55.450
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy advertising to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

608
00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a lot.</v>

609
00:28:56.791 --> 00:29:01.791
<v Speaker 2>I'll stare at like billboards or watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>commercials have watch like,</v>

610
00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:04.200
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I do think it,</v>

611
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:09.290
<v Speaker 2>it speaks to what a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like America thinks we are as a culture.</v>

612
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:16.320
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It speaks to what they think it is</v>

613
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.030
<v Speaker 2>appealing and what they think is gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

614
00:29:18.031 --> 00:29:19.480
<v Speaker 2>And so in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

615
00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.020
<v Speaker 2>like in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the same sense,</v>

616
00:29:22.021 --> 00:29:26.330
<v Speaker 2>like you can gauge a lot from a person</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the types of questions they ask you,</v>

617
00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you engage a lot from like even a</v>

618
00:29:28.771 --> 00:29:32.610
<v Speaker 2>climate by the type of commercials what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel is because they're trying to</v>

619
00:29:32.611 --> 00:29:34.560
<v Speaker 2>appeal to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is what they're saying.</v>

620
00:29:34.561 --> 00:29:37.620
<v Speaker 2>This is what we think everybody is</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking right now,</v>

621
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or how everyone feels or what they want.</v>

622
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.520
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

623
00:29:41.521 --> 00:29:44.650
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'll watch it and even like the</v>

624
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:46.080
<v Speaker 2>tonight show in those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

625
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:47.650
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

626
00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.730
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

627
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:52.420
<v Speaker 2>anything in function at its best is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

628
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

629
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.850
<v Speaker 2>where it hits a wall and just what we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying about comedy and what we're</v>

630
00:29:57.851 --> 00:30:01.090
<v Speaker 2>saying about a lot of things is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a thing tries to be something that</v>

631
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:02.030
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

632
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:06.760
<v Speaker 2>when it feels like these late night</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows when they're just doing fun things</v>

633
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:08.860
<v Speaker 2>that they think are fun and interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

634
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kim will always,</v>

635
00:30:11.741 --> 00:30:16.120
<v Speaker 2>every year does like the parents to tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids that know Halloween that they</v>

636
00:30:16.121 --> 00:30:19.060
<v Speaker 2>ate all the Halloween candy and the kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>reactions and stuff.</v>

637
00:30:19.061 --> 00:30:23.120
<v Speaker 2>Like I eat that stuff up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that you're going to be fun.</v>

638
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.490
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like when it,</v>

639
00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when shows pretend to be,</v>

640
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

641
00:30:28.151 --> 00:30:32.070
<v Speaker 2>89.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like when comedians pretending</v>

642
00:30:32.071 --> 00:30:34.280
<v Speaker 2>to be of a different era of pretend to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

643
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:37.690
<v Speaker 2>it just feels false and I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you check out.</v>

644
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just unnecessary at this point,</v>

645
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the Internet,</v>

646
00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.360
<v Speaker 1>you just have too many other venues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

647
00:30:46.361 --> 00:30:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of options.</v>

648
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of options and the vent,</v>

649
00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.710
<v Speaker 1>like watching things on the internet is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much more satisfying.</v>

650
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:56.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like watching a comic on a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get this chance to</v>

651
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.810
<v Speaker 1>chance to see who the fuck they really</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

652
00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Sort of some weird set in front of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience that got shipped in from</v>

653
00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Burbank and they got applause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Signs and everything.</v>

654
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.820
<v Speaker 1>It's very surreal when you go to a live</v>
<v Speaker 1>taping and you watch that.</v>

655
00:31:08.821 --> 00:31:09.840
<v Speaker 1>It's really surreal.</v>

656
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very like,</v>

657
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.470
<v Speaker 2>and I'll sit at I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

658
00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.410
<v Speaker 2>I have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

659
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.560
<v Speaker 2>it's always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have weird,</v>

660
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:24.950
<v Speaker 2>a late night thing because I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm bad at being like the,</v>

661
00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrity type of thing.</v>

662
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm just in it and just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at it and when the crowd is</v>

663
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:36.990
<v Speaker 2>giving an unnatural reaction to things</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just like,</v>

664
00:31:36.991 --> 00:31:37.710
<v Speaker 2>what do you.</v>

665
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too introspective.</v>

666
00:31:39.071 --> 00:31:40.620
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to just dive into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake.</v>

667
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:41.561
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

673
00:31:57.521 --> 00:32:00.760
<v Speaker 1>moment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where we'll be right back to</v>

<v Speaker 1>That will be right back.</v>

676
00:32:03.761 --> 00:32:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Shit like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

677
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.930
<v Speaker 1>where are you going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put</v>

678
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:12.400
<v Speaker 1>those commercials in later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just keep rolling.</v>

679
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Can we do and we'll be right back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's strange,</v>

680
00:32:16.511 --> 00:32:20.440
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The advertisement model of shoving an ad</v>

681
00:32:20.441 --> 00:32:23.470
<v Speaker 1>in every 15 minutes to shove in a series</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ads in.</v>

682
00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did they ever do that?</v>

683
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.333
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

684
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look,</v>

685
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:31.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unfortunate reality or fortunate Rio</v>

686
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:35.590
<v Speaker 2>I guess depends on what company you work</v>
<v Speaker 2>for is a.</v>

687
00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an advertiser's medium.</v>

688
00:32:38.621 --> 00:32:39.454
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

689
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:43.010
<v Speaker 3>they'll find a way to put the</v>
<v Speaker 3>commercials that even with the Internet,</v>

690
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:47.360
<v Speaker 3>youtube becomes traditional television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>

691
00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this internet commercials are longer</v>

692
00:32:49.911 --> 00:32:52.370
<v Speaker 3>than the TV commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe two minutes.</v>

693
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.980
<v Speaker 3>You can skip them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you get a two minute ones now?</v>

694
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't they got like minute to minute.</v>

695
00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get excited when I see a 15 second one</v>

696
00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:01.973
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh man.</v>

00:33:14.631 --> 00:33:19.140
<v Speaker 3>Commercials and I hate having to watch a</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

703
00:33:20.271 --> 00:33:22.760

<v Speaker 3>to watch the trailer that I'm.</v>

706
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:28.560
<v Speaker 3>The commercial does kind of show you</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

707
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.250
<v Speaker 3>what they think the culture is about</v>

711
00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.240

<v Speaker 3>a real manipulative,</v>

712
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.670
<v Speaker 3>mainstream version of what the average</v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

713
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.930
<v Speaker 3>think depressed too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people are like,</v>

718
00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.870
<v Speaker 3>what percentage do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's probably more than 20</v>

719
00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:03.380
<v Speaker 3>percent of Americans are depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just,</v>

720
00:34:03.381 --> 00:34:05.390
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>

721
00:34:05.391 --> 00:34:07.760
<v Speaker 3>A recent poll shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to give us a real good</v>

722
00:34:07.761 --> 00:34:10.070
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll say 20 percent,</v>

723
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.260
<v Speaker 3>20 percent of Americans suffer from</v>
<v Speaker 3>depression.</v>

724
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:14.590

<v Speaker 3>A form of the.</v>

725
00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:18.500
<v Speaker 3>Or are we saying specifically depression</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we saying like mental</v>

726
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:23.380
<v Speaker 3>illness,</v>

729
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:31.850
<v Speaker 3>It's the reason it's hard to quantify</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's like,</v>

730
00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:37.330
<v Speaker 3>it also is a thing that comes in phases</v>
<v Speaker 3>or post event specific like depression.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Described it really well.</v>

792
00:37:42.641 --> 00:37:45.850
<v Speaker 1>He did a podcast recently with me and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about.</v>

793
00:37:45.851 --> 00:37:50.320
<v Speaker 1>He went through a serious depression</v>
<v Speaker 1>episode where he was suicidal and he.</v>

794
00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:53.800
<v Speaker 1>His brain was just the way he described</v>
<v Speaker 1>it as like it was broken and I had to</v>

795
00:37:53.801 --> 00:37:57.830
<v Speaker 1>get it fixed and he started off on</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication than weaned himself off a</v>

796
00:37:57.831 --> 00:37:59.990
<v Speaker 1>medication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he was on the medication,</v>

797
00:37:59.991 --> 00:38:03.400
<v Speaker 1>that's also when his career took off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when his career took off.</v>

798
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:08.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean it alleviated a lot of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The what a lot of his issues were was</v>

799
00:38:09.851 --> 00:38:12.910
<v Speaker 1>also just like an unfulfilled life</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustration,</v>

800
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.210
<v Speaker 1>expectation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unrealized and then on top of that</v>

801
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:20.730
<v Speaker 1>compounded there was like legit mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues that were bothering them.</v>

802
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.170
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was just unclear on like what</v>

803
00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.180
<v Speaker 1>depression actually is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

804
00:38:25.181 --> 00:38:26.320
<v Speaker 1>because as you're saying that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

805
00:38:26.321 --> 00:38:27.760
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I have felt that</v>

806
00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.720
<v Speaker 1>everybody feels highs and the lows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right about that for sure.</v>

807
00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Right about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you exercise a lot and I think that</v>

808
00:38:36.761 --> 00:38:38.720
<v Speaker 1>probably helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

809
00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm just super myself up in my head and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

810
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:46.240
<v Speaker 1>But no exercising just releases releases</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the bullshit that people carry</v>

811
00:38:46.241 --> 00:38:49.240
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the what makes people feel</v>

812
00:38:49.241 --> 00:38:52.960
<v Speaker 1>terrible is that their body is fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>against their brain.</v>

813
00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Their body holds in so much tension and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

814
00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:02.040
<v Speaker 1>there are so fucked up and they never</v>
<v Speaker 1>get an endorphin release and their</v>

815
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:05.290
<v Speaker 1>bodies like an overflowing battery like</v>
<v Speaker 1>oozing out of the signs</v>

816
00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.980
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I always like,</v>

817
00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:10.830
<v Speaker 5>people don't meditate like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't work for people.</v>

818
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:13.800
<v Speaker 5>Like this shit works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That shit killed it for me.</v>

819
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.970
<v Speaker 5>How often you meditate?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

820
00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.210
<v Speaker 5>Like every day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like how much time?</v>

821
00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:19.330
<v Speaker 5>Twenty minutes.</v>

822
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good man.</v>

823
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a beautiful thing.</v>

824
00:39:21.611 --> 00:39:24.550
<v Speaker 1>If you could force that into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule and make sure that that's a</v>

825
00:39:24.551 --> 00:39:25.384
<v Speaker 1>part of your life.</v>

826
00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:28.710
<v Speaker 5>I got it from Seinfeld and Oprah now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like 10,</v>

827
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.610
<v Speaker 5>maybe 10.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

828
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.620
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

829
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.310
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

830
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:35.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean it doesn't activate something</v>
<v Speaker 5>that have,</v>

831
00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:39.060
<v Speaker 5>which is like we're supposed to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>do that though.</v>

832
00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.070
<v Speaker 1>The reflection and also what I think it</v>
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

833
00:39:42.071 --> 00:39:44.860
<v Speaker 1>one of the real good things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation does is it stops momentum</v>

834
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.730
<v Speaker 1>because there's like a momentum of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty thoughts and bad ideas and bad</v>

835
00:39:48.731 --> 00:39:53.020
<v Speaker 1>decisions and just anxiety and all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues that could fucking just</v>

836
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:57.610
<v Speaker 1>accumulate inside your consciousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never went unaddressed.</v>

837
00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:01.030
<v Speaker 1>They continue to like push it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You from the back and it's like you're</v>

838
00:40:01.031 --> 00:40:04.270
<v Speaker 1>just constantly in a state of momentum</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the bullshit that's going on.</v>

839
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.780
<v Speaker 1>But if you have a time for real</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection and just pause,</v>

840
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:10.450
<v Speaker 1>even if you're just concentrating only</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your breath,</v>

841
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:13.150
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to stop that momentum and give</v>

842
00:40:13.151 --> 00:40:15.340
<v Speaker 1>you a chance at like a renewed</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

843
00:40:15.341 --> 00:40:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Active.</v>

844
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:17.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

845
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.700
<v Speaker 5>that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember at the time I had a spiritual</v>

846
00:40:19.701 --> 00:40:24.701
<v Speaker 5>awakening in your house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>

847
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:28.490
<v Speaker 5>What was it about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just hit them.</v>

848
00:40:28.491 --> 00:40:32.540
<v Speaker 5>One day I was watching,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was watching like a seinfeld interview</v>

849
00:40:32.541 --> 00:40:33.321
<v Speaker 5>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

850
00:40:33.321 --> 00:40:34.640
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do it twice a day.</v>

851
00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:35.770
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

852
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:37.550
<v Speaker 5>let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This all went down.</v>

853
00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.700
<v Speaker 5>I used to live with them so I use.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went downstairs with my room and I</v>

854
00:40:40.701 --> 00:40:43.120
<v Speaker 5>meditated and I came back upstairs and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

855
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:44.570
<v Speaker 5>he was sitting on the couch and I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

856
00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.270
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nigga,</v>

857
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.200
<v Speaker 5>I just had an awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

858
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:56.550
<v Speaker 5>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

859
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:58.310
<v Speaker 5>oh no man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the first,</v>

860
00:40:58.311 --> 00:41:01.280
<v Speaker 5>the first message I got was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't save the world,</v>

861
00:41:01.281 --> 00:41:04.140
<v Speaker 5>but you could help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

862
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:08.350
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to back down in my room.</v>

863

<v Speaker 5>So when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's your process like?</v>

<v Speaker 5>You could also do that by just sitting</v>

932
00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:58.360
<v Speaker 5>there and just breathe in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>focusing on the breath and then all of a</v>

933
00:43:58.361 --> 00:44:02.350
<v Speaker 5>sudden your mind starts going into an</v>
<v Speaker 5>altered state and then you'll start.</v>

934
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.881
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I meditate.</v>

935
00:44:03.881 --> 00:44:05.650
<v Speaker 5>I just don't meditate every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

936
00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.560
<v Speaker 5>I definitely feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think exercise does that,</v>

937
00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:13.060
<v Speaker 5>especially cardio and especially yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something about yoga classes that just</v>

938
00:44:13.061 --> 00:44:16.450
<v Speaker 5>forces you into this state of mind where</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just are,</v>

939
00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.090
<v Speaker 5>you're only concentrating on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>movements that you're supposed to do.</v>

940
00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:24.300
<v Speaker 5>So if you could clear your head and stay</v>
<v Speaker 5>focused on the movements and not delve</v>

941
00:44:24.401 --> 00:44:28.360
<v Speaker 5>into your bank account or your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>credit card debt or what's wrong with</v>

942
00:44:28.361 --> 00:44:31.150
<v Speaker 5>your car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the bullshit you have bounced</v>

943
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 5>around in your head?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you could just</v>

944
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 1>take the time to concentrate only on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga.</v>

945
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.050
<v Speaker 1>It has this like a cleansing effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

946
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:39.450
<v Speaker 1>it really made you be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

947
00:44:39.451 --> 00:44:41.130
<v Speaker 1>fuck that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that shit.</v>

948
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Most things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most things are not worth freaking out</v>

949
00:44:44.491 --> 00:44:45.241
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most.</v>

950
00:44:45.241 --> 00:44:47.190
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good question.</v>

951
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember</v>

952
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:52.300
<v Speaker 2>reading is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just ask yourself what problems do I</v>

953
00:44:52.301 --> 00:44:57.301
<v Speaker 2>have right now but genuinely like</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems and the answer may not always</v>

954
00:44:57.551 --> 00:45:01.780
<v Speaker 2>be zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's usually surprisingly small.</v>

955
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:04.180
<v Speaker 2>When you think about the immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

956
00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:09.100
<v Speaker 2>not just the base level of maslow's</v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>

957
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:12.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if that's taken care of usually</v>

958
00:45:12.431 --> 00:45:14.010
<v Speaker 2>it's like Oh I don't re,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

959
00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:16.240
<v Speaker 2>there are things that are ongoing things</v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out,</v>

960
00:45:16.241 --> 00:45:20.440
<v Speaker 2>but like things that you could define as</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a problem and then just kind of</v>

961
00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.690
<v Speaker 2>staying in that space you have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

962
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:27.970
<v Speaker 2>like a control issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's a real issue where there's</v>

963
00:45:27.971 --> 00:45:29.890
<v Speaker 2>like immediacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

964
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:31.210
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when,</v>

965
00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.630
<v Speaker 2>when there are real problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

966
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:37.540
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you handled it well,</v>

967
00:45:37.541 --> 00:45:42.541
<v Speaker 2>like instinctually the things like a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of times people get caught in those</v>

968
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:48.190
<v Speaker 2>intense situations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they can handle like real problems.</v>

969
00:45:48.191 --> 00:45:52.970
<v Speaker 2>It's the anticipation of problems and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anticipation of solutions that bass.</v>

970
00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

971
00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.450
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

972
00:45:56.451 --> 00:46:00.170
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also sort of enlightened you to the</v>

973
00:46:00.171 --> 00:46:02.990
<v Speaker 1>fact that most of the time you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your problems are bullshit.</v>

974
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:04.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you break your leg,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

977

<v Speaker 1>killers trying to break their arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the experience is not that cool,</v>

1009
00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:28.480
<v Speaker 1>then it's like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1010
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:31.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm not worried about it that much.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the world is pretty soft right now.</v>

1013
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:41.630
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to get upset about nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonsense is the only thing that you have</v>

1014
00:47:41.631 --> 00:47:43.370
<v Speaker 2>that's a difficulty in your life.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and it's perspective.</v>

1016
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.980
<v Speaker 2>The reward for complaints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

1017
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a culture.</v>

1018
00:47:52.131 --> 00:47:56.570
<v Speaker 2>That's where we are rewarded for</v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly,</v>

1019
00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for having a public completion.</v>

1020
00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm well rewarded in the sense of like,</v>

1021
00:48:02.721 --> 00:48:03.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a,</v>

1022
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:06.910

<v Speaker 2>you can get attention for light,</v>

1023
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:10.040
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying by publicly airing</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1024
00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a grievance about a project and I'm</v>

1025
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:17.490
<v Speaker 2>speaking especially specifically about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we respond to content is just like,</v>

1026
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:22.520
<v Speaker 2>like a by publicly saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can speak to your respective group</v>

1027
00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:28.400
<v Speaker 2>and you have an immediate reward for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

1028
00:48:28.401 --> 00:48:29.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1029
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:30.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if we're more</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive.</v>

1030
00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:34.140
<v Speaker 2>We're just more outspoken about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1031
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:37.850
<v Speaker 2>things well because we have a definitely</v>
<v Speaker 2>more outraged.</v>

1032
00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.860
<v Speaker 2>They're looking to get outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1033
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:42.340
<v Speaker 2>that's a really common thing now that</v>
<v Speaker 2>just didn't exist a few days.</v>

1034
00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:44.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think it's outrageous.</v>

1035
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.741
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1036
00:48:45.741 --> 00:48:48.710
<v Speaker 2>I really don't think it's outrageous as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much as it cause outrage.</v>

1037
00:48:48.711 --> 00:48:53.060
<v Speaker 2>We've seen what outrage looks like at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1038
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:58.710
<v Speaker 2>when at the peak of like the black lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter movement where people at a core</v>

1039
00:49:00.811 --> 00:49:02.630
<v Speaker 2>is by people outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1040
00:49:02.631 --> 00:49:04.670
<v Speaker 2>But that's the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I'm saying,</v>

1041
00:49:04.671 --> 00:49:08.090
<v Speaker 2>but that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what outrage is and I don't want</v>

1042
00:49:08.091 --> 00:49:10.820
<v Speaker 2>to confuse that with like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1043
00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:13.130
<v Speaker 2>ational outreach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>restoration or outrage.</v>

1044
00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really important to draw that</v>

1045
00:49:15.531 --> 00:49:16.281
<v Speaker 2>distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1046
00:49:16.281 --> 00:49:18.260
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1047
00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.390
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are vocal about things.</v>

1048
00:49:20.391 --> 00:49:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Some issues real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things we started getting upset</v>

1049
00:49:24.441 --> 00:49:27.830
<v Speaker 2>about there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like certain we get upset about certain</v>

1050
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:32.390
<v Speaker 2>cultural appropriation things of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>week because it's a Sushi restaurant on</v>

1051
00:49:32.391 --> 00:49:35.020
<v Speaker 2>a college campus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>

1052
00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.200
<v Speaker 2>we get caught up in those things but in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not focus on,</v>

1053
00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I dunno,</v>

1054
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:45.290
<v Speaker 2>it's like real outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that corporations or afraid of</v>

1055
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.110
<v Speaker 2>is an outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's trending.</v>

1056
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:53.260
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to trend negatively for</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whatever period of time when,</v>

1057
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:57.830
<v Speaker 2>when people are upset with you and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done something genuinely wrong,</v>

1058
00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:02.510
<v Speaker 2>they'll show it beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will extend that if it makes sense.</v>

1059
00:50:02.511 --> 00:50:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1060
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:05.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that a lot of what outrages is</v>

1061
00:50:05.121 --> 00:50:07.520
<v Speaker 5>like comedian trying out jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1062
00:50:07.521 --> 00:50:10.820
<v Speaker 5>you try out jokes and 30 percent of them</v>
<v Speaker 5>are just straight bullshit</v>

1063
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:13.910
<v Speaker 5>fucking work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1064
00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.400
<v Speaker 5>He'd try him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They they stumble out,</v>

1065
00:50:16.401 --> 00:50:20.390
<v Speaker 5>you gave it a shot or you'll ad Lib</v>
<v Speaker 5>something in the moment on stage and</v>

1066
00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:23.060
<v Speaker 5>even after you say like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck did I just say?</v>

1067
00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:26.840
<v Speaker 5>I think there's some of that that people</v>
<v Speaker 5>are trying to.</v>

1068
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 5>Like I was reading this article the</v>

1069
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.940
<v Speaker 1>other day about some woman who's saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that yoga is supporting white supremacy</v>

1070
00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.240
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the dumbest shit ever.</v>

1071
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Some Indian lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was seeing the cultural</v>

1072
00:50:37.761 --> 00:50:42.761
<v Speaker 1>appropriation of yoga by white people is</v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting white supremacy and it was,</v>

1073
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really fun.</v>

1074
00:50:44.721 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are we doing?</v>

1075
00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:49.760
<v Speaker 1>But that's what she did is she tried a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad joke,</v>

1076
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:51.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a,</v>

1077
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:56.210
<v Speaker 1>she works on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a professor at some bullshit</v>

1078
00:50:56.211 --> 00:51:01.211
<v Speaker 1>college where they're just drowning in</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal arts and she just figured out a</v>

1079
00:51:01.371 --> 00:51:06.110
<v Speaker 1>way to say something outrageous that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought made sense in her own weird</v>

1080
00:51:06.111 --> 00:51:08.720
<v Speaker 1>bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this got published in a newspaper</v>

1081
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:11.000
<v Speaker 1>and then the whole world went just</v>
<v Speaker 1>collectively.</v>

1082
00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:13.900
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1083
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.400
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you are.</v>

1084
00:51:16.401 --> 00:51:20.810
<v Speaker 1>I try and a bit late night at the store.</v>

1085
00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.110
<v Speaker 1>You Do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just just riff something and it just</v>

1086
00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:29.500
<v Speaker 1>goes into a corner and just get stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roomba vacuum cleaner things is bouncing</v>

1087
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:32.660
<v Speaker 1>off the wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is not working.</v>

1088
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:35.330
<v Speaker 1>I've got to bail out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1089
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.700
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because it is people's</v>

1090
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:40.790
<v Speaker 1>favorite rage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a creative force.</v>

1091
00:51:40.791 --> 00:51:43.370
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she tried to make outrage where it</v>

1092
00:51:43.371 --> 00:51:47.660
<v Speaker 1>didn't exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes he catches right?</v>

1093
00:51:47.661 --> 00:51:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Like hoop earrings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White girls can't wear hoop earrings</v>

1094
00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:52.150
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was scared.</v>

1095
00:51:52.151 --> 00:51:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Were hooping hearings because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting called out for cultural</v>

1096
00:51:56.061 --> 00:51:59.350
<v Speaker 1>appropriation by which is hilarious by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latina chicks.</v>

1097
00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:03.080
<v Speaker 1>This particularly Latino chicks are</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying and it's just all social justice</v>

1098
00:52:03.081 --> 00:52:05.330
<v Speaker 1>warrior bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's really funny is.</v>

1099
00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:07.190
<v Speaker 1>So I had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm an asshole,</v>

1100
00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I had to google it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well who the fuck invented hearings?</v>

1101
00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:12.030
<v Speaker 1>The Sumerians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1102
00:52:12.031 --> 00:52:17.031
<v Speaker 1>the oldest version of hoop earrings is</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 2,500 BC from Iraq.</v>

1103
00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:22.160
<v Speaker 1>So Iraqis are the only ones who really</v>
<v Speaker 1>can claim cultural appropriation.</v>

1104
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:24.650
<v Speaker 1>People wearing hoop earrings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not Mexicans.</v>

1105
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:29.240
<v Speaker 1>So Mexicans settled down those white</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls alone because you stole it.</v>

1106
00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.120
<v Speaker 1>It was black girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1107
00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like who invented pants?</v>

1108
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Your culture appropriating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wearing pants.</v>

1109
00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Who invented paper?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on a Korean phone,</v>

1110
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:46.180
<v Speaker 1>bitching about people</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about man,</v>

1111
00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:48.140
<v Speaker 1>it goes deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1112
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:50.510
<v Speaker 1>People losing their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for things get outraged</v>

1113
00:52:50.511 --> 00:52:53.600
<v Speaker 1>at and so that they're trying jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're taking swings,</v>

1114
00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:56.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trying to pitches out there,</v>

1115
00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:57.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just spit balling.</v>

1116
00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean eventually if it's like,</v>

1117
00:53:00.561 --> 00:53:05.561
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna run out of ways to approach</v>

1118
00:53:05.871 --> 00:53:06.651
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1119
00:53:06.651 --> 00:53:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Like you run out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're run out of places to stab the</v>

1120
00:53:10.311 --> 00:53:12.680
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will they try some that don't stick or</v>

1121
00:53:12.681 --> 00:53:15.410
<v Speaker 1>some stick for like a couple of days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you remember Bossy,</v>

1122
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:17.330
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to say you can't say</v>
<v Speaker 1>bossy.</v>

1123
00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:19.340
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't call girls bossy?</v>

1124
00:53:19.341 --> 00:53:21.710
<v Speaker 1>It's sexist crows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girls Bossy.</v>

1125
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Don't call them bossy sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a thing where they were trying to</v>

1126
00:53:24.441 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 1>stop the use of the word</v>

1127
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.870
<v Speaker 3>or the phrase bossy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bossy.</v>

1128
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Sexist.</v>

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.960
<v Speaker 2>three year old niece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just,</v>

1282
01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:17.920
<v Speaker 2>and I am myself and speak exactly how I</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally speak around it.</v>

1283
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:20.180
<v Speaker 2>You're an adult longer than you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>

1284
01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:22.640
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was just like,</v>

1285
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.550
<v Speaker 2>why am I going to pretend the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds different?</v>

1286
01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:26.741
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1287
01:00:26.741 --> 01:00:30.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it felt like whose kids are there?</v>

1288
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Your brothers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brother,</v>

1289
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:34.880
<v Speaker 2>your brother and sister in law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody cool with that or they get</v>

1290
01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.690
<v Speaker 2>upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A vague.</v>

1291
01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:41.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean they go like sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also they get it.</v>

1292
01:00:41.031 --> 01:00:43.970
<v Speaker 2>They mocked my brother that they're very</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding why they.</v>

1293
01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:45.950
<v Speaker 2>They get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get that.</v>

1294
01:00:45.951 --> 01:00:49.150
<v Speaker 2>It's just like how people talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>

1295
01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that's important.</v>

1296
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you don't want to.</v>

1297
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:55.140
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>not swear,</v>

1300
01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:05.440

<v Speaker 1>people you work with or does that tell</v>

1304
01:01:10.221 --> 01:01:12.470

<v Speaker 1>out with some coworkers and they told a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty joke or started talking shit like</v>

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:19.850
<v Speaker 1>that will get back to human resources</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there'll be fired.</v>

1307
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Bosses are now following their employees</v>
<v Speaker 1>online and shit like twitter.</v>

1308
01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>That girl that got fired from NASA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hilarious.</v>

1309
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:31.610
<v Speaker 1>She got fired from NASA yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

1310
01:01:31.611 --> 01:01:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Holy Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a job at NASA and some guy tweeted</v>

1311
01:01:34.341 --> 01:01:36.500
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said language and she said,</v>

1312
01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.800
<v Speaker 1>suck my Dick and balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work at NASA,</v>

1313
01:01:40.550 --> 01:01:41.480
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

01:01:41.481 --> 01:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>and I am one of the people that oversee</v>
<v Speaker 1>something at Nasa and then it was</v>

1315
01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:50.090
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well she was about to be an intern</v>

1316
01:01:50.091 --> 01:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>working at NASA and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>

1317
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Everyone shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got accepted for a NASA internship and</v>

1318
01:01:56.181 --> 01:01:57.560
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he writes language.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suck my Dick and balls.</v>

1320
01:01:59.421 --> 01:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm working at NASA and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the National Space Council that</v>

1321
01:02:03.681 --> 01:02:04.760
<v Speaker 1>oversees NASA.</v>

1322
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1323
01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:16.660
<v Speaker 2>that shit is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suck my dick and balls and it's a girl.</v>

1324
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't even go to the fucking</v>

1325
01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:23.370
<v Speaker 3>the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw you talking about that.</v>

1326
01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1327
01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:24.993
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1328
01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:26.400
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could.</v>

1329
01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:30.060
<v Speaker 3>I can be convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was convinced that we didn't for a</v>

1330
01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:31.650
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm convinced.</v>

1331
01:02:31.651 --> 01:02:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I have no fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1332
01:02:33.031 --> 01:02:33.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1333
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:34.390
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1334
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:38.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we went to the moon just</v>
<v Speaker 3>off of base.</v>

1335
01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.980
<v Speaker 3>It's not rooted in science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much?</v>

1336
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:42.380
<v Speaker 3>How much have you really paid attention</v>
<v Speaker 3>to it?</v>

1337
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:44.940
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went down the rabbit hole for many,</v>

1338
01:02:44.941 --> 01:02:46.710
<v Speaker 3>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go off kind of like,</v>

1339
01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:50.490
<v Speaker 3>it's always like the social kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's smoke,</v>

1340
01:02:50.491 --> 01:02:53.790
<v Speaker 3>there's fire type foods of just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1341
01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:56.010
<v Speaker 3>us being in a race and no countries</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming second,</v>

1342
01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:58.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1343
01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:02.220
<v Speaker 3>other space programs not catching up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>1969,</v>

1344
01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 3>1969,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>

1345
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:07.080
<v Speaker 3>72 American technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1346
01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:07.914
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1347
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:10.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time we went was under the Nixon</v>

1348
01:03:10.111 --> 01:03:10.944
<v Speaker 3>administration.</v>

1349
01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:12.520
<v Speaker 3>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

1350
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.820
<v Speaker 3>these types of little things that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>make you go</v>

1351
01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:21.340
<v Speaker 3>like a flat earthers conference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've ever watched the press conference</v>

1352
01:03:21.361 --> 01:03:23.460
<v Speaker 3>when they returned from the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1353
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:24.390
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

1354
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:25.220
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

1355
01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.230
<v Speaker 3>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the clue in there or what's the</v>

1356
01:03:28.231 --> 01:03:31.110
<v Speaker 3>suspicious thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look super depressed.</v>

1357
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:35.700
<v Speaker 3>They look a super deceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look fidgety and uh,</v>

1358
01:03:35.701 --> 01:03:36.320
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1359
01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.280
<v Speaker 3>they're talking weird and they're saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1360
01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.140
<v Speaker 3>They refute later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things they said,</v>

1361
01:03:40.141 --> 01:03:41.730
<v Speaker 3>Michael Collins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's actually never,</v>

1362
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.270
<v Speaker 3>he's supposed to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd never landed on the surface of the</v>

1363
01:03:45.271 --> 01:03:47.610
<v Speaker 3>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong did.</v>

1364
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.670
<v Speaker 3>He stayed up in the orbiter and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

1365
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:53.040
<v Speaker 3>they were asking about stars and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1366
01:03:53.041 --> 01:03:53.611
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1367
01:03:53.611 --> 01:03:56.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't recall seeing any stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then years later he wrote in his</v>

1368
01:03:56.821 --> 01:04:00.930
<v Speaker 3>book about how magnificent stars look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of that shit,</v>

1369
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:04.110
<v Speaker 3>but the press conference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want,</v>

1370
01:04:04.111 --> 01:04:06.270
<v Speaker 3>and this doesn't mean anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a cop,</v>

1371
01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.150
<v Speaker 3>but if I was a cop and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>interviewing them,</v>

1372
01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:11.280
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these motherfuckers are guilty.</v>

1373
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Something is wrong here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>

1374
01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:16.610
<v Speaker 3>they seem like guilty people and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could look.</v>

1375
01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.600
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1376
01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:20.670
<v Speaker 3>they were probably psychologically</v>
<v Speaker 3>distressed.</v>

1377
01:04:20.671 --> 01:04:24.600
<v Speaker 3>They were probably dealing with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pressure of having come back from</v>

1378
01:04:24.601 --> 01:04:28.320
<v Speaker 3>the moon and all this fame that they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>never experienced their whole life.</v>

1379
01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:29.520
<v Speaker 3>They're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their astronauts,</v>

1380
01:04:29.521 --> 01:04:31.800
<v Speaker 3>they're scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now all of a sudden they're standing</v>

1381
01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:34.290
<v Speaker 3>in front of all these people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's asking them questions and</v>

1382
01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:35.800
<v Speaker 3>they feel super nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

1383
01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:37.200
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these niggas was lying.</v>

1384
01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.750
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My favorite thing is when you,</v>

1385
01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:43.410
<v Speaker 3>when a [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll say it very casually,</v>

1386
01:04:43.690 --> 01:04:45.890
<v Speaker 3>if people become like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1387
01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:49.710
<v Speaker 3>patriots and rocket scientists to tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like how we went,</v>

1388
01:04:49.711 --> 01:04:51.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know either.</v>

1389
01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this shit is bullshit because it</v>

1390
01:04:53.041 --> 01:04:55.590
<v Speaker 3>wasn't unit wasn't me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's stop with that.</v>

1391
01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:00.600
<v Speaker 3>So we probably lied about it and we live</v>
<v Speaker 3>better than any other country on earth</v>

1392
01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:04.430
<v Speaker 3>and I'm proud of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of weird shit with the</v>

1393
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:06.900
<v Speaker 3>video footage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of footage where it looks</v>

1394
01:05:06.901 --> 01:05:11.160
<v Speaker 3>like they're on wires dangling from</v>
<v Speaker 3>wires and they bounced back up from</v>

1395
01:05:11.161 --> 01:05:14.100
<v Speaker 3>their feet in this weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks they're being yanked up from</v>

1396
01:05:14.101 --> 01:05:16.770
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a video where it looks like</v>

1397
01:05:16.771 --> 01:05:17.920
<v Speaker 3>they're on trampolines</v>

1398
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>is if you google astronauts on</v>
<v Speaker 1>trampolines.</v>

1399
01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just looks like that.</v>

1400
01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>I actually put it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a video that I found Google</v>

1401
01:05:26.351 --> 01:05:30.790
<v Speaker 1>astronauts on trampolines is a video on</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube and you're watching them bounce</v>

1402
01:05:30.791 --> 01:05:31.720
<v Speaker 1>around and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1403
01:05:31.721 --> 01:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are on the fucking moon and</v>

1404
01:05:34.451 --> 01:05:38.080
<v Speaker 1>you're hiding behind the lunar module,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can't see their feet,</v>

1405
01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:41.980
<v Speaker 1>you can't see how they're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like either they're</v>

1406
01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:46.480
<v Speaker 1>bouncing on something or the being</v>
<v Speaker 1>yanked up in the air or it's one,</v>

1407
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>six gravity and it's just has a weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on people will look at this,</v>

1408
01:05:49.961 --> 01:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1409
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.460
<v Speaker 1>how strange is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1410
01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.670
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just lands.</v>

1411
01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:00.910
<v Speaker 1>But doesn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even the way he's,</v>

1412
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:03.820
<v Speaker 1>he's moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like he's being dangled.</v>

1413
01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.820
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange to see him bouncing</v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

1414
01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:07.923
<v Speaker 1>but that also</v>

1415
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:10.830
<v Speaker 2>just all the stuff we did at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we like playing golf with belts</v>

1416
01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:13.010
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the moon landing set was built by</v>

1417
01:06:13.011 --> 01:06:15.560
<v Speaker 2>the people who made the discovery zone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also</v>

1418
01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:17.980
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This slide</v>

1419
01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.330
<v Speaker 1>just jumped up and fell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so strange,</v>

1420
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:25.930
<v Speaker 1>but it also could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just what your body does at one</v>

1421
01:06:25.931 --> 01:06:27.070
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth's gravity.</v>

1422
01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:28.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole.</v>

1423
01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1424
01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1425
01:06:32.311 --> 01:06:34.470
<v Speaker 2>this one's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone else going back to the moon and</v>

1426
01:06:34.471 --> 01:06:35.580
<v Speaker 2>then if it matches.</v>

1427
01:06:36.810 --> 01:06:40.830
<v Speaker 1>This is from a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what was the name of the movie</v>

1428
01:06:40.831 --> 01:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could watch some of the NGO,</v>

1429
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:46.380
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some special effects they use in movies,</v>

1430
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:50.340
<v Speaker 1>but watch some of the weird shit go a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit further ahead of this.</v>

1431
01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

1432
01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:56.370
<v Speaker 1>There's some of the weird stuff where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see these guys like fall down and</v>

1433
01:06:56.371 --> 01:07:01.350
<v Speaker 1>then it looks like they just get yanked</v>
<v Speaker 1>back up by wires is very strange.</v>

1434
01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:03.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1435
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:04.690
<v Speaker 1>but the press conferences is trained.</v>

1436
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:07.940
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the social aspect of it cause it's</v>

1437
01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:12.941
<v Speaker 2>like I don't begin to know like how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>flag is supposed to look in the waving</v>

1438
01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:17.900
<v Speaker 2>and the shadows and the thing that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people argue about,</v>

1439
01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:18.993
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1440
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:21.890
<v Speaker 2>it's just the political and so it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1441
01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.710
<v Speaker 2>I kinda think I know when the government</v>
<v Speaker 2>is lying about something.</v>

1442
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:27.380
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the history is there.</v>

1443
01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch this,</v>

1444
01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:34.000
<v Speaker 1>watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch how he gets up like you'd gotten</v>

1445
01:07:34.001 --> 01:07:34.834
<v Speaker 1>yanked up.</v>

1446
01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:37.090
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of those.</v>

1447
01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:39.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it look like there are wires</v>

1448
01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.610
<v Speaker 1>pulled back up their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very strange.</v>

1449
01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:45.570
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever been in one six earth</v>

1450
01:07:45.571 --> 01:07:46.590
<v Speaker 1>gravity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>

1451
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:48.060
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that maybe.</v>

1452
01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it just looks fake because when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in one six earth gravity,</v>

1453
01:07:52.961 --> 01:07:57.961
<v Speaker 1>it's just how movement do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never ever been like up until day my,</v>

1454
01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:03.870
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my conspiracy belief is specific to</v>

1455
01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:09.540
<v Speaker 2>thinking that a man has walked around on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the surface of the specific to the</v>

1456
01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:11.970
<v Speaker 2>crashing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1457
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.960
<v Speaker 2>lunar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1458
01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:13.870
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

1459
01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:15.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1460
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:16.640
<v Speaker 2>It's specifically</v>

1461
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:18.470
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moving</v>

1462
01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.880
<v Speaker 3>it specifically that you don't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody has ever done this?</v>

1463
01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:24.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1464
01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:26.710
<v Speaker 3>In life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everyone's just saying we're the</v>

1465
01:08:26.711 --> 01:08:28.580
<v Speaker 3>only country that would have the press</v>
<v Speaker 3>conference,</v>

1466
01:08:28.581 --> 01:08:30.920
<v Speaker 3>some clips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird clips from the press conference</v>

1467
01:08:31.190 --> 01:08:32.400
<v Speaker 3>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the press conference it,</v>

1468
01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:35.480
<v Speaker 3>trip you out and see and see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like other,</v>

1469
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:39.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries who have the means to do it.</v>

1470
01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:44.170
<v Speaker 3>Like they're in intention about going</v>
<v Speaker 3>place in this place in medicine.</v>

1471
01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:49.180
<v Speaker 3>Go big screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look how sad these guys look.</v>

1472
01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:53.210
<v Speaker 6>So we're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This</v>

1473
01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:59.320
<v Speaker 6>was our pleasure to have in one great</v>
<v Speaker 6>adventure.</v>

1474
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.290
<v Speaker 6>It's an adventure that took place not</v>
<v Speaker 6>just in the month of July,</v>

1475
01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:09.310
<v Speaker 6>but rather one that took place in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>last decade.</v>

1476
01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:19.200
<v Speaker 6>We all hear and the people listening in</v>
<v Speaker 6>today had the opportunity to share that</v>

1477
01:09:20.351 --> 01:09:23.860
<v Speaker 6>adventure over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's developing an unfolding</v>

1478
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:30.750
<v Speaker 6>in the past months and years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's our privilege today to share with</v>

1479
01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:38.341
<v Speaker 6>you</v>
<v Speaker 6>some of the details of that final month</v>

1480
01:09:41.170 --> 01:09:43.810
<v Speaker 6>of July.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was</v>

1481
01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:50.550
<v Speaker 6>certainly the highlight for the three of</v>
<v Speaker 6>us have of that decade.</v>

1482
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:55.080
<v Speaker 3>They just went to the moon and they all</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked like they just saw the naked part</v>

1483
01:09:55.081 --> 01:09:56.680
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also have a alliance.</v>

1484
01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.430
<v Speaker 3>You tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neil,</v>

1485
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:01.880
<v Speaker 3>it looks so fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

1486
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:06.410
<v Speaker 3>that could be just extreme nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be people that don't know how to</v>

1487
01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:10.640
<v Speaker 3>handle being in front of press.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be a introverts that are forced</v>

1488
01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:12.710
<v Speaker 3>on the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be a lot of issues.</v>

1489
01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.990
<v Speaker 3>If you went to the moon and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>came back and uh,</v>

1490
01:10:14.991 --> 01:10:17.320
<v Speaker 3>you were sitting at press conference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you be at the light?</v>

1491
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:19.640
<v Speaker 3>Like what would your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would your actions be?</v>

1492
01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:22.100
<v Speaker 3>Would you be like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or would it be like more like,</v>

1493
01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.220
<v Speaker 3>like it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would look like a,</v>

1494
01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:28.190
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lake was a press conference after</v>

1495
01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:32.250
<v Speaker 3>they want you back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have my hat on champagne.</v>

1496
01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:37.970
<v Speaker 3>Just pointing to reporters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why did they bring back like a rock</v>

1497
01:10:38.871 --> 01:10:40.070
<v Speaker 3>or something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1498
01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.050
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They brought it back a lot.</v>

1499
01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Brought back many rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of them turned out to be</v>

1500
01:10:45.651 --> 01:10:48.100
<v Speaker 3>petrified wood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They gave one of them too.</v>

1501
01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:55.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They gave a moon rock in 69 or 72 hours.</v>

1502
01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:58.550
<v Speaker 3>The Prime Minister of Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever it was,</v>

1503
01:10:58.600 --> 01:10:59.121
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who.</v>

1504
01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:03.440
<v Speaker 3>The person who runs Holland and a years</v>
<v Speaker 3>later they analyze it and it was</v>

1505
01:11:03.441 --> 01:11:08.441
<v Speaker 3>petrified wood who was not a moon rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fairness.</v>

1506
01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:12.020
<v Speaker 3>In fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do get the,</v>

1507
01:11:12.021 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 3>like by the</v>

1508
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.280
<v Speaker 1>time we got to Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gift basket is going to change when</v>

1509
01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:22.680
<v Speaker 1>I given away the real moon rocks to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holland.</v>

1510
01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that.</v>

1511
01:11:23.491 --> 01:11:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>England gets some real moon rock.</v>

1512
01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>France gets a little rough,</v>

1513
01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.090
<v Speaker 1>but they get a little thing of the moon</v>
<v Speaker 1>rocks.</v>

1514
01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:36.270
<v Speaker 1>They the statute skill which you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got some dudes.</v>

1515
01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Did you think about this Mars mission?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1516
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:44.420
<v Speaker 1>that's all real rovers are real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all the technology's proven and</v>

1517
01:11:44.641 --> 01:11:47.220
<v Speaker 1>legitimate and I don't think you'd ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake anything today.</v>

1518
01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Like you could fake things in 1969 if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1519
01:11:51.031 --> 01:11:53.820
<v Speaker 1>if anything for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they did is it's been proven that</v>

1520
01:11:53.821 --> 01:11:58.821
<v Speaker 1>they faked some footage for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some photographs recorded over the</v>

1521
01:11:59.791 --> 01:12:01.680
<v Speaker 1>original.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1522
01:12:01.681 --> 01:12:05.220
<v Speaker 1>those little things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you recorded over the irt.</v>

1523
01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The original in a world where even the</v>

1524
01:12:07.291 --> 01:12:09.180
<v Speaker 1>importance of syndication was known.</v>

1525
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:14.360
<v Speaker 1>I think they also lost a telemetry data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like the binary hard ones and</v>

1526
01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Zeros that show the distance between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth and lunar module and every step of</v>

1527
01:12:18.061 --> 01:12:20.070
<v Speaker 1>the trip they lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1528
01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:22.980
<v Speaker 1>They lost that Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1529
01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta realize like people die and</v>

1530
01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:28.920
<v Speaker 1>people responsible for storage and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one's paying attention and there's</v>

1531
01:12:28.921 --> 01:12:31.580
<v Speaker 1>funding and the funding gets pulled and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1532
01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:34.920
<v Speaker 1>this plausible reasons for some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

1533
01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are episodes of blossom</v>
<v Speaker 1>being guarded in a vault somewhere in</v>

1534
01:12:41.161 --> 01:12:43.750
<v Speaker 1>burbank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>episodes of blossom.</v>

1535
01:12:44.010 --> 01:12:46.320
<v Speaker 1>You could get fucking money off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>blossom.</v>

1536
01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.200
<v Speaker 1>He can't make any money off of these God</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn moon landing clips.</v>

1537
01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some people that absolutely are</v>

1538
01:12:51.091 --> 01:12:55.680
<v Speaker 1>convinced that we didn't go and I used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be one of them and I would love if</v>

1539
01:12:55.681 --> 01:12:58.110
<v Speaker 1>they proved that it was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would make me more happy than</v>

1540
01:12:58.111 --> 01:12:59.160
<v Speaker 1>anything else in the world.</v>

1541
01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:00.930
<v Speaker 1>You know what a I'll would make me very</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>

1542
01:13:00.931 --> 01:13:03.750
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the thing that keeps me holding on</v>

1543
01:13:03.751 --> 01:13:07.020
<v Speaker 1>to maybe we went is a tour at Nasa once</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were nice.</v>

1544
01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:09.360
<v Speaker 1>That's probably it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then.</v>

1545
01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:11.820
<v Speaker 1>That was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you gotta realize those aren't the</v>

1546
01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:14.140
<v Speaker 1>same people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when people say like no lies.</v>

1547
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those were NASA from 1969.</v>

1548
01:13:17.551 --> 01:13:19.470
<v Speaker 1>These are different humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1549
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:21.930
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about 48 fucking years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

1550
01:13:21.931 --> 01:13:26.931
<v Speaker 1>These are completely different humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stand on the backs of lives.</v>

1551
01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there was a list of NASA so we can</v>

1552
01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.770
<v Speaker 1>let us ask questions if you going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking lie.</v>

1553
01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:41.400
<v Speaker 1>That's what you say about the tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop inviting those to NASA and allowing</v>

1554
01:13:42.181 --> 01:13:43.740
<v Speaker 1>us to ask questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to lie.</v>

1555
01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they think they're lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're involved in,</v>

1556
01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:49.320
<v Speaker 1>if any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was a conspiracy,</v>

1557
01:13:49.321 --> 01:13:50.880
<v Speaker 1>like say if they did fake the moon</v>
<v Speaker 1>landing.</v>

1558
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:53.250
<v Speaker 1>No one today who's alive as a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1559
01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:55.980
<v Speaker 1>except Buzz Aldrin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the only one still alive,</v>

1560
01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:57.560
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1561
01:13:57.630 --> 01:13:59.340
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he punched the dude in the face,</v>

1562
01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:02.220
<v Speaker 1>punched some guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he said he was Bart seabrook</v>

1563
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:03.600
<v Speaker 1>parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seabrook made a move.</v>

1564
01:14:03.601 --> 01:14:06.540
<v Speaker 1>I had dinner with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1565
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:09.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dinner with him many years ago and back</v>

1566
01:14:09.571 --> 01:14:13.990
<v Speaker 1>when I was a full blown a moon</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonbeliever and you know,</v>

1567
01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:18.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm contacted them and got ahold of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took him to dinner and</v>

1568
01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:25.010
<v Speaker 1>you use your celebrity for good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was</v>

1569
01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:31.300
<v Speaker 1>just like these real specific pockets of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you just want to talk to.</v>

1570
01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:31.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1571
01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:33.250
<v Speaker 1>well I wanted to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1572
01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:37.720
<v Speaker 1>So you can see someone doing interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see someone in an edited</v>

1573
01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:39.850
<v Speaker 1>format and you kind of get a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>who they are.</v>

1574
01:14:40.090 --> 01:14:43.330
<v Speaker 1>You don't really get a sense of who they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are until you actually talk to them like</v>

1575
01:14:43.331 --> 01:14:45.040
<v Speaker 1>you and him sharing a plate of pasta.</v>

1576
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:46.990
<v Speaker 1>What was this like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he,</v>

1577
01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:52.080
<v Speaker 1>did he give you anything that's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives context so like that moment or</v>

1578
01:14:52.631 --> 01:14:55.380
<v Speaker 1>like just like why did it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1579
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:59.260
<v Speaker 1>he was convinced he was absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced that it was a hoax and he</v>

1580
01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:01.060
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was convinced was that there was a</v>

1581
01:15:01.061 --> 01:15:04.920
<v Speaker 1>space race between us and Russia and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was a,</v>

1582
01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:08.320
<v Speaker 1>it was essentially a militarized space</v>
<v Speaker 1>race.</v>

1583
01:15:08.321 --> 01:15:11.410
<v Speaker 1>And what they were trying to do is prove</v>
<v Speaker 1>military superiority.</v>

1584
01:15:11.411 --> 01:15:14.050
<v Speaker 1>If you had the rockets that could get</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to the moon,</v>

1585
01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:19.051
<v Speaker 1>your technology was superior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way he framed it is like the</v>

1586
01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:24.690
<v Speaker 1>United States had control over what was</v>
<v Speaker 1>aired and they put it on television and</v>

1587
01:15:24.701 --> 01:15:27.160
<v Speaker 1>no one foresaw the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one foresaw that.</v>

1588
01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.090
<v Speaker 1>One day you would be looking at these</v>
<v Speaker 1>clips on youtube and analyzing them and</v>

1589
01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:33.730
<v Speaker 1>putting them in slow Mo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even think that that was</v>

1590
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:38.340
<v Speaker 1>going to be a thing on television that</v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

1591
01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And They were going to show it in black</v>

1592
01:15:40.331 --> 01:15:43.970
<v Speaker 1>and white and they were going to have it</v>
<v Speaker 1>three d projected so that you would</v>

1593
01:15:43.971 --> 01:15:48.280
<v Speaker 1>project projected on a screen and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were filming it would have to</v>

1594
01:15:48.281 --> 01:15:50.830
<v Speaker 1>film the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they.</v>

1595
01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:54.070
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even get a live feed when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was airing on television.</v>

1596
01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:57.940
<v Speaker 1>It was airing people filming the screen</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was being projected on.</v>

1597
01:15:58.850 --> 01:16:00.250
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1598
01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1599
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:05.380
<v Speaker 1>They broke it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it looked more and more a grainy and</v>

1600
01:16:05.381 --> 01:16:09.970
<v Speaker 1>fake like they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were trying to do something that</v>

1601
01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:12.400
<v Speaker 1>was not done to the technology of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

1602
01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:16.180
<v Speaker 1>that would possibly obscure some fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did it all those ways.</v>

1603
01:16:16.450 --> 01:16:20.050
<v Speaker 1>There's so many things that they did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would go.</v>

1604
01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:21.480
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in,</v>

1605
01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:26.290
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like conspiracies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a conspiracy theorists wet dream</v>

1606
01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:30.010
<v Speaker 1>because if it is a fake is the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake of all time.</v>

1607
01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:33.130
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>squirrely about it.</v>

1608
01:16:33.190 --> 01:16:35.230
<v Speaker 1>There's so many things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean it's fake.</v>

1609
01:16:35.610 --> 01:16:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's so many things.</v>

1610
01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:39.880
<v Speaker 1>So has anybody been to them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1611
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.060
<v Speaker 1>No one's been to the moon since 1969 to</v>
<v Speaker 1>1972.</v>

1612
01:16:43.210 --> 01:16:45.640
<v Speaker 1>There was the only trips they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven attempts,</v>

1613
01:16:45.641 --> 01:16:48.130
<v Speaker 1>six of them successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apollo 13 was the one that wasn't</v>

1614
01:16:48.131 --> 01:16:49.540
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was that big movie.</v>

1615
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they landed on the moon and then came</v>

1616
01:16:52.481 --> 01:16:57.481
<v Speaker 1>back seven times 262,000 miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's where it gets crazy.</v>

1617
01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Or plus or minus depending on where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moon's out.</v>

1618
01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:03.980
<v Speaker 1>And what's crazy is 260,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 miles.</v>

1619
01:17:03.981 --> 01:17:06.370
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which crazy.</v>

1620
01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1621
01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:09.770
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My bad.</v>

1622
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

1623
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:10.761
<v Speaker 3>thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1624
01:17:10.761 --> 01:17:15.190
<v Speaker 3>that's three zeroes</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was like,</v>

1625
01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:20.260
<v Speaker 3>what map or you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting that no other human space</v>

1626
01:17:21.651 --> 01:17:25.640
<v Speaker 3>mission where a human has been a part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it since then has ever gone more than</v>

1627
01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:29.210
<v Speaker 3>400 miles from the earth's surface is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that where the uh,</v>

1628
01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.580
<v Speaker 3>space station,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the space shuttle missions,</v>

1629
01:17:31.581 --> 01:17:33.260
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>EverYthing was outside.</v>

1630
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:35.480
<v Speaker 3>It was further than 400,</v>
<v Speaker 3>400 miles.</v>

1631
01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:39.560
<v Speaker 3>So the guy you hAd dinner with did what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For buzz aldrin to sock them.</v>

1632
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:43.820
<v Speaker 3>He told buzz aldrin he was a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said you're a liar and a crook.</v>

1633
01:17:43.821 --> 01:17:47.880
<v Speaker 3>And buzz went pitch</v>
<v Speaker 3>popped him.</v>

1634
01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:48.753
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The job.</v>

1635
01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:52.660
<v Speaker 3>Has anyone contacted them after that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1636
01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:55.100
<v Speaker 3>I'd imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he's doing.</v>

1637
01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean immediately after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1638
01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:00.050
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1639
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:02.980
<v Speaker 3>The guy bart cbo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean immediately after the punch.</v>

1640
01:18:02.981 --> 01:18:04.430
<v Speaker 3>Is there any type of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like.</v>

1641
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:09.230
<v Speaker 3>I think he tried to press charges and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cops told him to go fuck off.</v>

1642
01:18:09.231 --> 01:18:10.820
<v Speaker 3>I think it was one of those folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1643
01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:14.480
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't the best punch either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you go to the hospital from</v>

1644
01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:17.090
<v Speaker 3>that punch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buzz was like in his eighties at the</v>

1645
01:18:17.091 --> 01:18:19.520
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he tried,</v>

1646
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:21.740
<v Speaker 3>he followed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he harassed a lot of those guys.</v>

1647
01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:25.370
<v Speaker 3>He harassed a lot of the astronauts and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to get him to swear on bibles.</v>

1648
01:18:25.730 --> 01:18:28.910
<v Speaker 3>he'd bring a bible and this bible that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want on the moon.</v>

1649
01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:31.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was.</v>

<v Speaker 3>anniversary of the apollo moon missions.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He gives a speech at the white house in</v>
<v Speaker 3>front of this group of honor roll</v>

1653
01:18:43.221 --> 01:18:45.650

1659
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.540
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean we didn't go to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>moon.</v>

1660
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:06.870
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that it's fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really funny because I presented it</v>

1661
01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:07.341
<v Speaker 3>as like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1662
01:19:07.341 --> 01:19:11.850

<v Speaker 3>have half of what you're getting.</v>

1663

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a way more.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're going to watch this and held back</v>
<v Speaker 3>tears as he spoke these brief.</v>

1666
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:21.850
<v Speaker 3>This is from a funny thing happened on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way to the moon part,</v>

1667
01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:24.890
<v Speaker 3>cbos moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is a real thing that happened</v>

1668
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:26.263
<v Speaker 7>today.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We had</v>

1669
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:32.890
<v Speaker 7>a group of students among america's best</v>
<v Speaker 7>to you.</v>

1670
01:19:33.081 --> 01:19:36.650
<v Speaker 7>We say we have only completed a</v>
<v Speaker 7>beginning.</v>

1671
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:41.870
<v Speaker 7>We leave you much.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That is under.</v>

1672
01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:45.830
<v Speaker 7>There are great ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Undiscovered</v>

1673
01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:52.340
<v Speaker 7>breakthroughs available to those who can</v>
<v Speaker 7>remove one of truths,</v>

1674
01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:54.440
<v Speaker 7>protective layers.</v>

1675
01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:59.740
<v Speaker 3>What he is the clock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1676
01:19:59.830 --> 01:20:03.850
<v Speaker 3>well two things that mean a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfair to it and you add that fucking</v>

1677
01:20:03.851 --> 01:20:06.910
<v Speaker 3>wanker music to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything sells incredibly creepy,</v>

1678
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.060
<v Speaker 3>but it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does sound like a one of truth.</v>

1679
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:16.070
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get more cryptic and you also can't get</v>

1680
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:21.560
<v Speaker 3>more exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It almost sounds like seat theorists and</v>

1681
01:20:21.561 --> 01:20:25.380
<v Speaker 3>almost kind of sounds like he's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the child who actually figures out</v>

1682
01:20:25.381 --> 01:20:28.680
<v Speaker 3>how to go to the fucking moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're great breakthroughs for those</v>

1683
01:20:28.681 --> 01:20:31.620
<v Speaker 3>who can remove one of truce protective</v>
<v Speaker 3>layers.</v>

1684
01:20:32.010 --> 01:20:35.850
<v Speaker 3>What would you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you rather the the moon</v>

1685
01:20:35.851 --> 01:20:40.851
<v Speaker 3>confession or the art kelly confession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had to pick one r kelly made a</v>

1686
01:20:41.401 --> 01:20:43.080
<v Speaker 3>song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1687
01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:48.050
<v Speaker 3>I need that moon confession.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:51.210
<v Speaker 3>I need that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Art kelly.</v>

1689
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:53.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't need that confession.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>

1690
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:57.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's up to the wall.</v>

1691
01:20:57.861 --> 01:21:01.200
<v Speaker 3>Now think the law is going to have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of that,</v>

1692
01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:04.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are kelly seems to be pretty tough lawn,</v>

1693
01:21:05.370 --> 01:21:07.590
<v Speaker 3>but the moon confession would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating.</v>

1694
01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:12.710
<v Speaker 3>I will be be excited or like a moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I dunno,</v>

1695
01:21:14.190 --> 01:21:16.410
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's not on them to prove that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went.</v>

1696
01:21:16.411 --> 01:21:17.700
<v Speaker 3>So I'm saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1697
01:21:17.701 --> 01:21:18.900
<v Speaker 3>just some type of light.</v>

1698
01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:23.220
<v Speaker 3>I may 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>69.</v>

1699
01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.230
<v Speaker 3>It's a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nixon's president,</v>

1700
01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:27.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they did lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1701
01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:29.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to think I knew a.</v>

1702
01:21:29.881 --> 01:21:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Do not think I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's foolish.</v>

1703
01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:34.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't know jack shit about</v>
<v Speaker 3>astrophysics,</v>

1704
01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:37.500
<v Speaker 3>but I know if there was a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1705
01:21:37.501 --> 01:21:41.130
<v Speaker 3>if there's any president we would guess</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be down.</v>

1706
01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:43.610
<v Speaker 3>It'd be trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did tell us about it.</v>

1707
01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:44.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what I'm saying,</v>

1708
01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:48.370
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm saying like nixon just like it.</v>

1709
01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:52.890
<v Speaker 3>It is a perfect storm of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>nixon.</v>

1710
01:21:52.891 --> 01:21:53.641
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1711
01:21:53.641 --> 01:21:56.040
<v Speaker 3>he's the most deceptive president of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>time except the current one.</v>

1712
01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1713
01:21:57.330 --> 01:21:58.163
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1714
01:21:58.760 --> 01:21:59.593
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1715
01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:02.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very interesting.</v>

1716
01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:05.280
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've shut down a lot of barbecues was</v>

1717
01:22:05.281 --> 01:22:08.550
<v Speaker 3>talking about just bringing it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you have more information.</v>

1718
01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:11.080
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a fraction of the shit that I</v>

1719
01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:11.460
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

1720
01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:16.240
<v Speaker 3>I did research for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I debated a,</v>

1721
01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:19.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists on penn jillette's radio show</v>

1722
01:22:19.111 --> 01:22:20.220
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did it go?</v>

1723
01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:25.170
<v Speaker 3>Pretty good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though I don't even agree with some</v>

1724
01:22:25.171 --> 01:22:28.880
<v Speaker 3>of the shit that I said back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where does that argument end on just a</v>

1725
01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:31.440
<v Speaker 3>agree to disagree?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a time constraint.</v>

1726
01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:34.470
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do it far differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I think far differently now that I</v>

1727
01:22:34.471 --> 01:22:36.390
<v Speaker 3>did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would not take this.</v>

1728
01:22:36.391 --> 01:22:39.450
<v Speaker 3>I know we didn't do it approach because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1729
01:22:39.451 --> 01:22:43.830
<v Speaker 3>We didn't do it and that's the thing I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I very casually go,</v>

1730
01:22:44.850 --> 01:22:46.770
<v Speaker 3>probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just.</v>

1731
01:22:46.771 --> 01:22:51.320
<v Speaker 3>The things that don't add up to me don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>add up in a way that just makes me go.</v>

1732
01:22:51.330 --> 01:22:53.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know about the van allen</v>

1733
01:22:53.011 --> 01:22:54.780
<v Speaker 3>radiation belts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know about all that?</v>

1734
01:22:56.190 --> 01:23:00.270
<v Speaker 3>Not enough to like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a belt of radiation,</v>

1735
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.700
<v Speaker 3>like a doughnut shaped from just years</v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

1736
01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.990
<v Speaker 3>It's just naturally surrounds the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1737
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:07.570
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm thinking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about the.</v>

1738
01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about the belt of from</v>

1739
01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.910
<v Speaker 1>years of like satellites and so there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit too,</v>

1740
01:23:12.911 --> 01:23:15.360
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't much of that in 1969.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not near what it.</v>

1741
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:18.430
<v Speaker 1>What about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The van allen radiation belts is intense</v>

1742
01:23:18.431 --> 01:23:22.540
<v Speaker 1>ban of radiation for miles that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that surrounds the earth that you would</v>

1743
01:23:22.541 --> 01:23:27.470
<v Speaker 1>have to go through to get to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they apparently though there's a hole</v>

1744
01:23:27.471 --> 01:23:31.120
<v Speaker 1>that you could go through and the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the radiation belt isn't there,</v>

1745
01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:34.480
<v Speaker 1>but the idea is that there was no</v>
<v Speaker 1>shielding to protect them from</v>

1746
01:23:34.481 --> 01:23:37.690
<v Speaker 1>radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just weren't in this aluminum tin</v>

1747
01:23:37.691 --> 01:23:40.270
<v Speaker 1>can you were touched or lunar module if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a.</v>

1748
01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:44.050
<v Speaker 1>There was a science exhibit I went to</v>
<v Speaker 1>once that had a,</v>

1749
01:23:44.530 --> 01:23:47.980
<v Speaker 1>a replica of the lunar module and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can put your hands on it and it's like,</v>

1750
01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:48.730
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing is,</v>

1751
01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:53.730
<v Speaker 1>oh really made a coke cans and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing so weird looking.</v>

1752
01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:59.880
<v Speaker 1>There's also like photographs that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking wanky lights that go at two</v>

1753
01:24:00.221 --> 01:24:04.810
<v Speaker 1>different angles and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's possible due to uneven</v>

1754
01:24:04.811 --> 01:24:07.900
<v Speaker 1>terrain and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things reflecting off of things,</v>

1755
01:24:07.901 --> 01:24:12.160
<v Speaker 1>all these different variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also really enjoy just like playing</v>

1756
01:24:12.161 --> 01:24:17.120
<v Speaker 1>around and the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was this houston.</v>

1757
01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:19.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a space shuttle?</v>

1758
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:23.540
<v Speaker 1>The shuttle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm you see I have a music.</v>

1759
01:24:23.730 --> 01:24:25.120
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen these.</v>

1760
01:24:25.150 --> 01:24:28.050
<v Speaker 1>You're another dude that walks around</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a phone with no case on this.</v>

1761
01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.500
<v Speaker 1>This is me on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1762
01:24:31.190 --> 01:24:33.280
<v Speaker 1>you don't put a case on your phone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose jobs.</v>

1763
01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Died so that we could a sleekness you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>a risk taker.</v>

1764
01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I liked the feel of the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's neil degrasse tyson was sitting</v>

1765
01:24:41.321 --> 01:24:45.220
<v Speaker 1>in that seat 24 hours ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the exact same thing he has is with</v>

1766
01:24:45.230 --> 01:24:46.300
<v Speaker 1>no case I need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1767
01:24:46.301 --> 01:24:47.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could only be here now.</v>

1768
01:24:49.810 --> 01:24:52.390
<v Speaker 1>He would go crazy on us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the reasons why I dropped</v>

1769
01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:53.380
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking to him.</v>

1770
01:24:53.381 --> 01:24:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1771
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:55.290
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1772
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's dedicated his whole life.</v>

1773
01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.680
<v Speaker 1>So the idea of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1774
01:24:59.681 --> 01:25:03.610
<v Speaker 1>you know what else he hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's dedicated his whole life to</v>

1775
01:25:03.611 --> 01:25:05.950
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know but I'm just saying like to</v>

1776
01:25:05.951 --> 01:25:08.860
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way that like that's part of</v>

1777
01:25:08.861 --> 01:25:10.570
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of like the kid growing up</v>

1778
01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:13.660
<v Speaker 1>there is an adult during conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>

1779
01:25:13.661 --> 01:25:15.970
<v Speaker 1>He's got too much other shit to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this real.</v>

1780
01:25:15.971 --> 01:25:19.000
<v Speaker 1>He's thinking about actual real science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he doesn't have time for that</v>

1781
01:25:19.001 --> 01:25:22.150
<v Speaker 1>nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he will aluminate you on why he</v>

1782
01:25:22.151 --> 01:25:26.890
<v Speaker 1>thinks it's stupid and it would be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly difficult task to fake that.</v>

1783
01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:32.460
<v Speaker 1>But it wouldn't be as difficult in 1969</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it would be in 2018 if you tried to</v>

1784
01:25:32.501 --> 01:25:33.700
<v Speaker 1>do that in 2018.</v>

1785
01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Basically possible America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the tuskegee experiment existed,</v>

1786
01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:42.160
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was just in a.</v>

1787
01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Was that the six?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It went on for 20 years.</v>

1788
01:25:44.771 --> 01:25:48.030
<v Speaker 1>It was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the exact number,</v>

1789
01:25:48.031 --> 01:25:51.870
<v Speaker 1>but it was like 20 years of history</v>
<v Speaker 1>where this is happening in like,</v>

1790
01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:57.040
<v Speaker 1>not like so many things can just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened under the give people syphilis</v>

1791
01:25:57.041 --> 01:26:00.090
<v Speaker 1>or did this app.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

1792
01:26:00.450 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm given bLack men syphilis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like kind of like,</v>

1793
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:06.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what the research was</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1794
01:26:06.891 --> 01:26:10.160
<v Speaker 1>If iT's like monitoring its effects or</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that was exactly what it was.</v>

1795
01:26:10.170 --> 01:26:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was just a.</v>

1796
01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like 20 years,</v>

1797
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:14.303
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1798
01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:18.530
<v Speaker 1>the tuskegee hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are real conspiracies,</v>

1799
01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.590
<v Speaker 1>unquestionably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undeniably real conspiracies.</v>

1800
01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Like a gulf of tonkin which got us into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Vietnam war.</v>

1801
01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:30.590
<v Speaker 1>They pretended that a ship got attacked</v>
<v Speaker 1>by North Korea or by north Vietnam.</v>

1802
01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Was it north Vietnam?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it was by Vietnam in the south</v>

1803
01:26:36.081 --> 01:26:39.050
<v Speaker 1>pacific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this motivated everybody to get into</v>

1804
01:26:39.051 --> 01:26:40.510
<v Speaker 1>war with Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never happened.</v>

1805
01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.290
<v Speaker 1>It's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made it up.</v>

1806
01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Operation northwoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 62,</v>

1807
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:49.730
<v Speaker 1>signed by the joint chiefs of staff</v>
<v Speaker 1>vetoed by president kennedy.</v>

1808
01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:55.120
<v Speaker 1>It was a a signed order where they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to plan out fake attacks on</v>

1809
01:26:55.881 --> 01:26:58.640
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were going to launch a drone</v>

1810
01:26:58.641 --> 01:27:01.100
<v Speaker 1>jetliner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blow it up in the air and blame it on</v>

1811
01:27:01.101 --> 01:27:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were going to arm cuban friendly's</v>

1812
01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:07.070
<v Speaker 1>and have them attack guantanamo bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to pay them,</v>

1813
01:27:07.071 --> 01:27:11.330
<v Speaker 1>arm them to attack guantanamo bay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it would give us the motivation</v>

1814
01:27:11.331 --> 01:27:14.420
<v Speaker 1>to go to war with Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was all signed by the joint chiefs</v>

1815
01:27:14.421 --> 01:27:15.860
<v Speaker 1>of staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to sacrifice american</v>

1816
01:27:15.861 --> 01:27:17.510
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to kill americans.</v>

1817
01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:20.840
<v Speaker 1>They were going to have people attack</v>
<v Speaker 1>americans and they were going to blame</v>

1818
01:27:20.841 --> 01:27:23.810
<v Speaker 1>it on the cubans and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>orchestrating it all to get people</v>

1819
01:27:23.811 --> 01:27:25.490
<v Speaker 1>motivated for a war with Cuba.</v>

1820
01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.440
<v Speaker 1>And president kennedy came along and</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1821
01:27:27.441 --> 01:27:31.940
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he vetoed it and stopped it,</v>

1822
01:27:32.150 --> 01:27:35.960
<v Speaker 1>and a year later he was dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of the things that he did.</v>

1823
01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:40.310
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that he did that lead</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people to believe that there was a</v>

1824
01:27:40.311 --> 01:27:44.420
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy that he was murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one to the lee harvey</v>

1825
01:27:44.421 --> 01:27:49.421
<v Speaker 1>oswald case is a fascinating one.</v>

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:44.840
<v Speaker 1>mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's playing on turner.</v>

1849
01:28:44.841 --> 01:28:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Classic movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

1850
01:28:46.311 --> 01:28:49.150
<v Speaker 1>So you could add music to this resident</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the edit,</v>

1851
01:28:49.230 --> 01:28:52.580
<v Speaker 1>like gimme some volume jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and play that from the beginning.</v>

1852
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:54.450
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see him walking again.</v>

1853
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Give me some volume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hear this,</v>

1854
01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:04.540
<v Speaker 1>but look at these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're walking them through.</v>

1855
01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:07.670
<v Speaker 1>But look how the cops are like way on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outside too.</v>

1856
01:29:07.671 --> 01:29:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1857
01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:11.950
<v Speaker 7>Shot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They'll look how they're holding them.</v>

1858
01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:26.240
<v Speaker 7>Here's a man with a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Never shot another round.</v>

1859
01:29:27.170 --> 01:29:29.030
<v Speaker 7>One round kills them</v>

1860
01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:34.830
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very strange.</v>

1861
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Strange place to even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did he shoot him?</v>

1862
01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:40.530
<v Speaker 1>The guts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1863
01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:43.140
<v Speaker 1>like in the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird.</v>

1864
01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Even the way he drew his go was very</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1865
01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:48.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1866
01:29:48.570 --> 01:29:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I think there's probably many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in that murder.</v>

1867
01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:52.921
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1868
01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:54.000
<v Speaker 1>very likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1869
01:29:54.010 --> 01:29:57.180
<v Speaker 1>this is a cruder film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't get played on tv to 1:10 years</v>

1870
01:29:57.181 --> 01:29:59.480
<v Speaker 1>after the assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

1871
01:29:59.650 --> 01:30:00.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who played it?</v>

1872
01:30:01.170 --> 01:30:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Dick gregory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick gregory got a out of that film and</v>

1873
01:30:06.391 --> 01:30:09.170
<v Speaker 1>he brought it to the geraldo rivera show</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like,</v>

1874
01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:12.960
<v Speaker 1>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 1970 something as I think the.</v>

1875
01:30:12.970 --> 01:30:17.970
<v Speaker 1>The murder was in 63 and I think he</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought it on the geraldo rivera show</v>

1876
01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:21.000
<v Speaker 1>75.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

1877
01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Hey man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what and knowing that it</v>

1878
01:30:23.441 --> 01:30:27.250
<v Speaker 2>played on a geraldo more than makes up</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the al capone's vault.</v>

1879
01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Geraldo used to be legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man is a guy.</v>

1880
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:36.070
<v Speaker 1>People don't realize geraldo was super</v>
<v Speaker 1>legit journalist who's amazing.</v>

1881
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Dear dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gregory was amazing.</v>

1882
01:30:38.421 --> 01:30:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was an activist before anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>even knew what the fuck that man and as</v>

1883
01:30:41.301 --> 01:30:44.780
<v Speaker 1>a comedian for him to be appearing on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this show,</v>

1884
01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:46.310
<v Speaker 1>geraldo rivera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful hair.</v>

1885
01:30:46.490 --> 01:30:50.810
<v Speaker 1>God look at his hair and dick gregory</v>
<v Speaker 1>look young and handsome and he brings</v>

1886
01:30:50.811 --> 01:30:52.700
<v Speaker 1>this out and explains to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1887
01:30:52.730 --> 01:30:57.200
<v Speaker 1>it is highly likely that the president</v>
<v Speaker 1>got shot from the front and look at his</v>

1888
01:30:57.201 --> 01:30:58.670
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go back into the left.</v>

1889
01:30:58.671 --> 01:31:02.060
<v Speaker 1>You see his brain spray and the blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>spray out of his head.</v>

1890
01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:03.920
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they played it,</v>

1891
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:08.810
<v Speaker 1>people were stunned and you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly see him grabbing his neck,</v>

1892
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:12.890
<v Speaker 1>like you could see the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucked up video and it's amazing</v>

1893
01:31:12.891 --> 01:31:16.010
<v Speaker 1>that if we didn't have this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would probably have a completely</v>

1894
01:31:16.011 --> 01:31:17.600
<v Speaker 1>different narrative of what happened at</v>
<v Speaker 1>kennedy.</v>

1895
01:31:17.601 --> 01:31:22.601
<v Speaker 1>One guy with one camera opened up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility that there was a massive</v>

1896
01:31:22.791 --> 01:31:27.230
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy that killed the president and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it led to the release of countless books</v>

1897
01:31:27.410 --> 01:31:28.910
<v Speaker 1>and so much speculation.</v>

1898
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:29.790
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1899
01:31:29.850 --> 01:31:33.090
<v Speaker 2>how many files are still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1900
01:31:33.091 --> 01:31:35.730
<v Speaker 2>what's the timestamp before all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>files were on the case?</v>

1901
01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them were released,</v>

1902
01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:41.430
<v Speaker 2>fairly came out like last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even this year.</v>

1903
01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:42.690
<v Speaker 2>And I don't even remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

1904
01:31:42.691 --> 01:31:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back into the left.</v>

1905
01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the conclusion</v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

1906
01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:47.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just missed it.</v>

1907
01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:47.650
<v Speaker 2>Rewind it.</v>

1908
01:31:47.650 --> 01:31:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So greeny.</v>

1909
01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>

1910
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Watch back into the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch here,</v>

1911
01:31:52.450 --> 01:31:57.060
<v Speaker 1>eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here comes the spray.</v>

1912
01:31:57.690 --> 01:31:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

1913
01:31:59.410 --> 01:32:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way his head throws back,</v>

1914
01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:04.900
<v Speaker 1>it seems very likely that he was hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the front.</v>

1915
01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:10.030
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also possible that he was hit from</v>

1916
01:32:10.031 --> 01:32:12.730
<v Speaker 1>the back and that his body just spasm</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

1917
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:14.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1918
01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.160
<v Speaker 1>no one really knows.</v>

1919
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:18.360
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen jackie the movie jackie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1920
01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:22.650
<v Speaker 2>theY captured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He captures like that moment,</v>

1921
01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:24.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's for the film,</v>

1922
01:32:24.091 --> 01:32:25.880
<v Speaker 2>but it in such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1923
01:32:27.130 --> 01:32:30.420
<v Speaker 2>it's a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really beautifully captured moment that</v>

1924
01:32:30.421 --> 01:32:33.900
<v Speaker 2>he kind of plays throughout the film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just for that alone.</v>

1925
01:32:33.901 --> 01:32:37.320
<v Speaker 2>I thought the movie was beautiful in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very underrated,</v>

1926
01:32:37.321 --> 01:32:38.250
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1927
01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:41.070
<v Speaker 2>but it captured it really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1928
01:32:41.071 --> 01:32:42.380
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy</v>

1929
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:43.650
<v Speaker 1>moment in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1930
01:32:43.710 --> 01:32:45.840
<v Speaker 1>they assassinated the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was caught on film.</v>

1931
01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:49.230
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if dick gregory didn't get that video</v>

1932
01:32:49.231 --> 01:32:52.190
<v Speaker 1>footage to geraldo rivera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this in the movie like,</v>

1933
01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:55.960
<v Speaker 1>oh jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

1934
01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:57.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1935
01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:00.200
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>was she picking up his mouth?</v>

1936
01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:01.680
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1937
01:33:01.681 --> 01:33:05.200
<v Speaker 1>lenny bruce had a whole fucking bid a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

1938
01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm juSt saying as they tried to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she was picking up his brain,</v>

1939
01:33:07.561 --> 01:33:09.640
<v Speaker 1>she was running away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

1940
01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:12.900
<v Speaker 1>she knew he was dead and she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>escaping.</v>

1941
01:33:12.901 --> 01:33:17.901
<v Speaker 1>She was climbing off the back of the car</v>
<v Speaker 1>to escape and then the secret service is</v>

1942
01:33:18.661 --> 01:33:21.080
<v Speaker 1>behind her and they tried to help her</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1943
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy dude.</v>

1944
01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.910
<v Speaker 1>There's also the difference in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>autopsy,</v>

1945
01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:30.990
<v Speaker 1>the autopsy and the autopsy in dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they.</v>

1946
01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:34.190
<v Speaker 1>The way they examined his wounds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dallas versus the way they described in</v>

1947
01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:36.510
<v Speaker 1>bethesda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maryland when they flew him to that</v>

1948
01:33:36.511 --> 01:33:37.200
<v Speaker 1>hospital.</v>

1949
01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1950
01:33:38.610 --> 01:33:39.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1951
01:33:39.031 --> 01:33:39.490
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1952
01:33:39.490 --> 01:33:41.820
<v Speaker 1>they turned the entry wound into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>neck,</v>

1953
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.270
<v Speaker 1>which they said was a bullet hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They turned that into a tracheotomy</v>

1954
01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:49.170
<v Speaker 1>wound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They change the way they thought.</v>

1955
01:33:49.171 --> 01:33:51.810
<v Speaker 1>The entrance wound to the head was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1956
01:33:51.811 --> 01:33:56.811
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weird fuckery that went</v>
<v Speaker 1>on between dallas and Maryland and then</v>

1957
01:33:57.001 --> 01:34:00.990
<v Speaker 1>there was also generals in the room that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were there that wouldn't allow doctors</v>

1958
01:34:00.991 --> 01:34:05.991
<v Speaker 1>to come and do certain parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>autopsy is a lot of weird shit.</v>

1959
01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean also the president,</v>

1960
01:34:08.611 --> 01:34:10.740
<v Speaker 1>you have to realize the present United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States is shot.</v>

1961
01:34:10.741 --> 01:34:12.220
<v Speaker 1>It's top secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know.</v>

1962
01:34:13.770 --> 01:34:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Just like to not have the files lineup</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

1963

1997
01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:06.470
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it almost,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's one of those things that you</v>

2000
01:36:11.931 --> 01:36:15.170
<v Speaker 3>experienced where you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just kind of looking down at it.</v>

2001
01:36:15.171 --> 01:36:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a</v>

01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:21.680
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2003
01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:22.600
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2004
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:25.220
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2005
01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:29.900
<v Speaker 3>if who you are and your act is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>reliant upon having fun.</v>

2006
01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:30.621
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or,</v>

2007
01:36:30.621 --> 01:36:32.250
<v Speaker 3>or a truth to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2008
01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:35.360
<v Speaker 3>the presentation is a certain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has a certain amount of truth to it.</v>

2009
01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where you are right now,</v>

2010
01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:39.230
<v Speaker 3>you are on your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2011
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:44.410
<v Speaker 3>which is also a thing always have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>guard for me because it's so a really</v>

2012
01:36:44.781 --> 01:36:45.800
<v Speaker 3>absorb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absorb,</v>

2013
01:36:45.801 --> 01:36:50.801
<v Speaker 3>absorb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like I'm reacting to it and by</v>

2014
01:36:51.290 --> 01:36:56.290
<v Speaker 3>exactly how I feel right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked with jb smooth once we were</v>

2015
01:36:58.071 --> 01:37:03.071
<v Speaker 3>working in a club or a college in New</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jersey and it was real hard to get to.</v>

2016
01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:05.810
<v Speaker 3>And this was back before gps.</v>

<v Speaker 3>paper,</v>

2018
01:37:08.630 --> 01:37:10.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was real late,</v>

2019
01:37:10.850 --> 01:37:14.720
<v Speaker 3>like a half hour late plus maybe even</v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

2020
01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:16.340
<v Speaker 3>And the show was supposed to start at</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight.</v>

2021
01:37:16.341 --> 01:37:19.130
<v Speaker 3>It was already 8:30 and he wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they said,</v>

2022
01:37:19.131 --> 01:37:21.290
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just have a seat in the green room</v>

<v Speaker 3>and wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2024
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:24.290
<v Speaker 3>when he gets here we'll put them on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I go,</v>

2025

<v Speaker 3>documentary on these fires in malibu</v>

2027
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:36.850

<v Speaker 3>and fucking burnt all these houses down.</v>

2028
01:37:37.791 --> 01:37:41.360

<v Speaker 3>and they're looking for their dog.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's a firefighter and he comes out and</v>

2031
01:37:47.031 --> 01:37:50.510
<v Speaker 3>he didn't even lose his house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just taking care of all these</v>

2032
01:37:50.511 --> 01:37:53.270
<v Speaker 3>people that did lose their houses and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>built this house and it was like his</v>

2033

<v Speaker 3>life savings and he's just.</v>

<v Speaker 1>know how to step back and reassess and</v>

2059
01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:01.540

<v Speaker 2>it all goes to like perception.</v>

2111
01:41:12.061 --> 01:41:16.890
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people make of comedians,</v>

<v Speaker 2>out and you do these things like what</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's expectations are.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

01:41:36.450 --> 01:41:38.640
<v Speaker 2>People do the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bits.</v>

2120
01:41:38.670 --> 01:41:42.410
<v Speaker 2>That's just not a thing that I do have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation now.</v>

2121
01:41:42.450 --> 01:41:45.840
<v Speaker 2>You need to attend to the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be interesting.</v>

2122
01:41:45.841 --> 01:41:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

01:41:47.130 --> 01:41:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like a,</v>

2124
01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:49.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2125
01:41:49.891 --> 01:41:54.420
<v Speaker 2>like it's not even that they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it has to be tailored to you.</v>

2126
01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:58.230
<v Speaker 2>You can't do the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just fill into the mold of</v>

2127
01:41:58.231 --> 01:41:59.640
<v Speaker 2>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2128
01:41:59.650 --> 01:42:02.250
<v Speaker 2>it was just going to make the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing over and over.</v>

2129
01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Well the art forms is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>underappreciated because it seems that</v>

2130
01:42:05.111 --> 01:42:06.850
<v Speaker 1>we're just talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2131
01:42:06.851 --> 01:42:09.460
<v Speaker 1>it seems like exactly what I talked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk,</v>

2132
01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:10.700
<v Speaker 1>I talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2133
01:42:10.710 --> 01:42:14.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not like we all play guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see someone go up on your frIends</v>

2134
01:42:14.721 --> 01:42:16.660
<v Speaker 1>from back home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do a pretty good.</v>

2135
01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because everybody's been funny at one</v>

2136
01:42:19.571 --> 01:42:22.330
<v Speaker 1>point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've all hung around with somebody who</v>

2137
01:42:22.331 --> 01:42:26.560
<v Speaker 1>said some hilarious shit and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that feels good.</v>

2138
01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels good when they do that.</v>

2139
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Then when they say that and they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feeling like,</v>

2140
01:42:30.821 --> 01:42:32.170
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just made everybody laugh.</v>

2141
01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:35.740
<v Speaker 1>We've all felt that chasing probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt that before we ever did comedy.</v>

2142
01:42:36.130 --> 01:42:40.090
<v Speaker 1>So they see you on stage and they see</v>
<v Speaker 1>you killing and they say,</v>

2143
01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I could do that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing that.</v>

2144
01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:45.640
<v Speaker 1>He's doing what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could do that.</v>

2145
01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Then they get it in their head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their head to market,</v>

2146
01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:50.080
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck can't I do it?</v>

2147
01:42:50.670 --> 01:42:53.050
<v Speaker 1>They get in their head like he's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

2148
01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:57.890
<v Speaker 1>He's not doing backflips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's surfing waves,</v>

2149
01:42:59.110 --> 01:43:02.770
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You what you're doing is stuff they do.</v>

2150
01:43:03.130 --> 01:43:03.963
<v Speaker 1>I had it.</v>

2151
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:06.180
<v Speaker 5>I had a cousin like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>sometimes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>If y'all want to go up,</v>

2158
01:43:19.601 --> 01:43:20.470
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should.</v>

2159

<v Speaker 5>it was mostly my boys do it.</v>

2160
01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:23.350
<v Speaker 5>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So uh,</v>

2161
01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:25.020
<v Speaker 5>my cousin jeremy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2162
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:26.110
<v Speaker 5>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever.</v>

2163
01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:30.610
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do that shit gets up and he does good.</v>

2164
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:32.410
<v Speaker 5>He's a funny dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2165
01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:34.390
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right man,</v>

2166
01:43:34.450 --> 01:43:36.400
<v Speaker 5>do that shit everyday for 10 years.</v>

2167
01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality is some people are good.</v>

2168
01:43:44.371 --> 01:43:45.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2169
01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:49.470
<v Speaker 2>some comedians started just by me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do this shit</v>

2170
01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:52.530
<v Speaker 1>great at great at it and</v>

2171
01:43:52.570 --> 01:43:53.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>

2172
01:43:53.331 --> 01:43:55.280
<v Speaker 3>and that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that uh,</v>

2173
01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:58.670
<v Speaker 3>if you are going to do it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like anything,</v>

2174
01:43:58.790 --> 01:44:00.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it is like the,</v>

2175
01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:03.170
<v Speaker 3>what you're choosing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like make sure that the</v>

2176
01:44:03.171 --> 01:44:07.280
<v Speaker 3>articulation is yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An interest in,</v>

2177
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:09.890
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think that's kind of the goal.</v>

2178
01:44:09.891 --> 01:44:13.100
<v Speaker 3>Like what however you get into it or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever inspired it or whatever.</v>

2179
01:44:13.101 --> 01:44:14.930
<v Speaker 3>Like if you are doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>

2180
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:19.250
<v Speaker 3>do it and do it at its highest level if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

2181
01:44:19.610 --> 01:44:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2182
01:44:20.930 --> 01:44:24.470
<v Speaker 3>I think stand up what you were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't get the respect that</v>

2183
01:44:24.471 --> 01:44:28.850
<v Speaker 3>other art forms get because there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no like if you see someone play</v>

2184
01:44:28.851 --> 01:44:30.410
<v Speaker 3>guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I play the drums or something like that.</v>

2185
01:44:30.411 --> 01:44:32.930
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any illusion that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>go up and do exactly what they do,</v>

2186
01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:37.670
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people have the illusion in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their mind that they can go on stage and</v>

2187
01:44:37.671 --> 01:44:38.390
<v Speaker 3>be funny.</v>

2188
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:40.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're just talking to eva or</v>

2189
01:44:40.881 --> 01:44:44.990
<v Speaker 3>even just be interesting to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to be anything in the</v>

2190
01:44:44.991 --> 01:44:45.824
<v Speaker 3>room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

2191
01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:49.580
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the reason for the perception is</v>

2192
01:44:49.581 --> 01:44:51.610
<v Speaker 3>the things that we accept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2193
01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:56.120
<v Speaker 3>it really is that like a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that we accept contribute to.</v>

2194
01:44:56.850 --> 01:44:57.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2195
01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:03.480
<v Speaker 3>we make it like we allow ourselves to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>presented like court justice.</v>

2196
01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:06.560
<v Speaker 3>YeAh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2197
01:45:06.561 --> 01:45:08.930
<v Speaker 3>and it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the rare things that anybody</v>

2198
01:45:08.931 --> 01:45:10.340
<v Speaker 3>can try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2199
01:45:10.341 --> 01:45:15.341
<v Speaker 3>You can go up open mic night and try and</v>
<v Speaker 3>while you're up there doing stand up,</v>

2200
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:19.810
<v Speaker 3>somebody who's a professional might drop</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and popping,</v>

2201
01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:21.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chappelle might show up and do a set.</v>

2202
01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:24.020
<v Speaker 3>Jeff ross might go up there dot merera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might show up,</v>

2203
01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:27.710
<v Speaker 3>people show up and do sats and share the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage with you.</v>

2204
01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:31.540
<v Speaker 3>It's your first day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2205
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:34.700
<v Speaker 3>That's a rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't take place in music or</v>

2206
01:45:34.701 --> 01:45:39.701
<v Speaker 3>anywhere else where you get an open mic</v>
<v Speaker 3>night and there's 30 people doing three</v>

2207
01:45:39.741 --> 01:45:44.450
<v Speaker 3>minutes and anybody can be one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

2208
01:45:44.451 --> 01:45:46.490
<v Speaker 3>It's soulless people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2209
01:45:46.491 --> 01:45:49.730
<v Speaker 3>A lot of homeless people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of sketchy fucking weirdos to</v>

2210
01:45:49.731 --> 01:45:52.630
<v Speaker 3>touch the same mic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you know,</v>

2211
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:58.100
<v Speaker 3>mike doesn't change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody cleans that comedy store.</v>

2212
01:45:58.120 --> 01:45:59.420
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got an intense.</v>

2213
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:05.270
<v Speaker 3>No one's taking a clorox wipe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fuck is clean in anything at that</v>

2214
01:46:05.271 --> 01:46:07.730
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They barely cleaned the tables.</v>

2215
01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:11.180
<v Speaker 3>The place they just deliver drinks and</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep the party rolling.</v>

2216
01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:15.700
<v Speaker 3>That's part of why it's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's grimy gutter</v>

2217
01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:20.690
<v Speaker 3>layer of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's covered everything for sure.</v>

2218
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:26.270
<v Speaker 3>I think when they changed out the improv</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they swapped that lab for that back</v>

2219
01:46:26.271 --> 01:46:28.880
<v Speaker 3>bar and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put that bar in there and just like</v>

2220
01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:31.400
<v Speaker 3>it seemed like they like removed a body</v>
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>

2221
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:32.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2222
01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.430
<v Speaker 3>I got it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2223
01:46:34.670 --> 01:46:37.610
<v Speaker 3>but I mean in the way that like got this</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy went away.</v>

2224
01:46:37.670 --> 01:46:40.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just kind of a kind of miami</v>

2225
01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:44.720
<v Speaker 3>infusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I feel like a night club in encino</v>

2226
01:46:44.721 --> 01:46:46.730
<v Speaker 3>restaurant bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was like.</v>

2227
01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just with the sofas</v>

2228
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:51.410
<v Speaker 2>and they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2229
01:46:51.930 --> 01:46:52.621
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2230
01:46:52.621 --> 01:46:54.150
<v Speaker 2>this uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this room needs a place for people to</v>

2231
01:46:54.151 --> 01:46:54.900
<v Speaker 2>lounge more.</v>

2232
01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

2233
01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:58.430
<v Speaker 1>well it's kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kinda figured it out now they've</v>

2234
01:46:58.431 --> 01:47:01.260
<v Speaker 1>got the little shows that they do there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting,</v>

2235
01:47:01.530 --> 01:47:03.840
<v Speaker 1>but it used to be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Used to be like a room,</v>

2236
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:07.590
<v Speaker 1>like a separate room that was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy in arusha fears.</v>

2237
01:47:07.770 --> 01:47:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Whole storytellers show started out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2238
01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.050
<v Speaker 1>That's where he would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would run it there because it was</v>

2239
01:47:13.051 --> 01:47:14.550
<v Speaker 1>like a 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 seat room.</v>

2240
01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:19.750
<v Speaker 2>When you're talking about the lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lab was the bar.</v>

2241
01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:24.040
<v Speaker 2>It was the lab because they redid it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It allowed you to add a couple of times.</v>

2242
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about the mate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mate,</v>

2243
01:47:26.670 --> 01:47:28.570
<v Speaker 2>the redoing of the memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the lab,</v>

2244
01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:31.000
<v Speaker 2>the lab room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2245
01:47:31.001 --> 01:47:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that could have a really good energy</v>

2246
01:47:34.421 --> 01:47:36.940
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it had like that really pink</v>

2247
01:47:36.941 --> 01:47:38.800
<v Speaker 2>curtains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those factor.</v>

2248
01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:39.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember.</v>

2249
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:41.560
<v Speaker 2>I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2250
01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:46.560
<v Speaker 2>I remember doing like a montreal</v>
<v Speaker 2>showcase showcase that that was like my</v>

2251
01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:48.260
<v Speaker 2>first and only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2252
01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I did it twice a year later that week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2253
01:47:53.170 --> 01:47:56.590
<v Speaker 1>The improv is a weird spot that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hallway when you wait and go on,</v>

2254
01:47:56.620 --> 01:48:00.220
<v Speaker 1>there's nowhere to hide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stuck in the hallway.</v>

2255
01:48:00.221 --> 01:48:02.260
<v Speaker 1>People walking by and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2256
01:48:02.261 --> 01:48:03.190
<v Speaker 1>let me talk to you about something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2257
01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm going on stage right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to go,</v>

2258
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:05.890
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me get a selfie.</v>

2259
01:48:06.130 --> 01:48:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Like did they could touch you like right</v>
<v Speaker 1>before going on stage again.</v>

2260
01:48:11.210 --> 01:48:13.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that never happens with Gary Clark.</v>

2261
01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:15.980
<v Speaker 1>He's never about to go onstage and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude in the hallway with.</v>

2262
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:16.421
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>karen,</v>

2263
01:48:16.421 --> 01:48:17.260
<v Speaker 1>let me get to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2264
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:20.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You woke up and stuff.</v>

2265
01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:23.350
<v Speaker 1>But that's part of the reason why it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

2266
01:48:23.351 --> 01:48:25.480
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the reason because one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2267
01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:29.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's also part of the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so fucking weird art forum.</v>

2268
01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:30.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2269
01:48:30.311 --> 01:48:31.480
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2270
01:48:31.481 --> 01:48:32.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is best.</v>

2271
01:48:32.831 --> 01:48:37.600
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting in like you get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of perspective and thoughts,</v>

2272
01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:42.610
<v Speaker 2>so you're doing a lot of sets these days</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't gone up really haven't gone.</v>

2273
01:48:42.850 --> 01:48:47.850
<v Speaker 2>I've done maybe two or three sets in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past year and a half maybe.</v>

2274
01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the last time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you do like two minutes and walk</v>

2275
01:48:55.211 --> 01:48:56.044
<v Speaker 2>off?</v>

2276
01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just</v>

2277
01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:05.500
<v Speaker 2>not when it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're ideas are going now.</v>

2278
01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:10.620
<v Speaker 2>Where's your ideas going now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Felt like it's a lot of film projects</v>

2279
01:49:10.871 --> 01:49:13.350
<v Speaker 2>and like some television stuff just</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels more normal to you.</v>

2280
01:49:13.370 --> 01:49:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just feels like the way of.</v>

2281
01:49:15.970 --> 01:49:17.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2282
01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:21.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I had like a tv show I would do a</v>

2283
01:49:21.281 --> 01:49:24.160
<v Speaker 2>lot of thoughts would just go there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do stand up a lot during that</v>

2284
01:49:24.161 --> 01:49:25.510
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2285
01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:31.320
<v Speaker 2>I like to just focus in like put the</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy where you feel the most creative.</v>

2286
01:49:31.451 --> 01:49:34.210
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could go up and you could,</v>

2287
01:49:34.650 --> 01:49:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something about stand up right now,</v>

2288
01:49:38.050 --> 01:49:39.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's it simultaneously.</v>

2289
01:49:39.971 --> 01:49:40.721
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

2290
01:49:40.721 --> 01:49:45.010
<v Speaker 2>there's some really amazing things</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening and just kind of as a whole is</v>

2291
01:49:45.011 --> 01:49:48.370
<v Speaker 2>just like a certain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going through like this</v>

2292
01:49:48.371 --> 01:49:50.890
<v Speaker 2>growing phase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this kind of identity thing,</v>

2293
01:49:50.891 --> 01:49:51.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2294
01:49:51.130 --> 01:49:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there needs to be kind of</v>

2295
01:49:55.271 --> 01:50:00.271
<v Speaker 2>this overhaul and even one in its</v>
<v Speaker 2>presentation and to what the expectation</v>

2296
01:50:01.001 --> 01:50:03.970
<v Speaker 2>of performer audience thing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of like,</v>

2297
01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:08.110
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go and I'll see a lot of trump</v>

2298
01:50:08.111 --> 01:50:10.990
<v Speaker 2>stuff and a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like new perspective.</v>

2299
01:50:10.991 --> 01:50:12.520
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2300
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:17.340
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of civil rights leaders and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of things and,</v>

2301
01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:19.600
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not even good.</v>

2302
01:50:19.601 --> 01:50:24.010
<v Speaker 2>So rising leaders just talking points</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just kind of preaching,</v>

2303
01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:26.320
<v Speaker 2>preaching the choir is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

2304
01:50:26.530 --> 01:50:29.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing is this unique</v>

2305
01:50:29.411 --> 01:50:33.000
<v Speaker 2>articulation in this unique thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be bringing it.</v>

2306
01:50:33.001 --> 01:50:34.660
<v Speaker 2>It's show and tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it is like,</v>

2307
01:50:34.780 --> 01:50:35.770
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this thing.</v>

2308
01:50:35.771 --> 01:50:37.720
<v Speaker 2>I have this thought that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 2>unique.</v>

2309
01:50:37.721 --> 01:50:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I have this way of presenting this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that I think is unique and every</v>

2310
01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:43.750
<v Speaker 2>now and again it's profitable right now.</v>

2311
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:45.790
<v Speaker 2>This is the bubble where it is right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2312
01:50:45.791 --> 01:50:47.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go up and you</v>

2313
01:50:50.170 --> 01:50:53.380
<v Speaker 2>speak for your group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you speak in this type of way,</v>

2314
01:50:53.381 --> 01:50:56.730
<v Speaker 2>you can get rewarded for it and kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these immediate rewards are understand</v>

2315
01:50:56.731 --> 01:50:57.460
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

2316
01:50:57.460 --> 01:51:00.220
<v Speaker 2>it really does kind of choke the art</v>
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>

2317
01:51:00.221 --> 01:51:01.840
<v Speaker 2>IT chokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting about it,</v>

2318
01:51:02.230 --> 01:51:03.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just so many people trying to</v>

2319
01:51:03.671 --> 01:51:07.030
<v Speaker 2>stand out and it's so difficult to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and they find these paths and one</v>

2320
01:51:07.031 --> 01:51:11.390
<v Speaker 2>of those paths is to be someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really moral and righteous and has</v>

2321
01:51:11.410 --> 01:51:13.340
<v Speaker 2>something to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also under the.</v>

2322
01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:18.380
<v Speaker 2>It's under the illusion of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>rebellious in an edgy.</v>

2323
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:21.820
<v Speaker 2>It's under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's under the illusion of these things</v>

2324
01:51:21.821 --> 01:51:24.560
<v Speaker 2>because it's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2325
01:51:24.561 --> 01:51:27.260
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when dick gregory said the things that</v>

2326
01:51:27.261 --> 01:51:32.020
<v Speaker 2>he said and the things we said there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>real danger in a conservative country.</v>

2327
01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:35.380
<v Speaker 2>There's real danger to a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They says you get onstage and you're</v>

2328
01:51:35.381 --> 01:51:38.590
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck trump in los angeles and New York</v>

2329
01:51:38.591 --> 01:51:41.710
<v Speaker 2>city honing his skills and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2330
01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:43.180
<v Speaker 2>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for you.</v>

2331
01:51:43.210 --> 01:51:47.170
<v Speaker 2>That unique perspective you bring about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how this is the worst of times.</v>

2332
01:51:47.930 --> 01:51:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2333
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:51.460
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of voices,</v>

2334
01:51:51.850 --> 01:51:53.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of great stuff to</v>

2335
01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:54.400
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>

2336
01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:56.610
<v Speaker 2>there are unique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2337
01:51:56.740 --> 01:51:58.180
<v Speaker 2>expect like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

2338
01:51:58.181 --> 01:52:00.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's flooded right now.</v>

2339
01:52:01.330 --> 01:52:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Do you plan on going Back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have aspirations or do you have a</v>

2340
01:52:04.031 --> 01:52:05.650
<v Speaker 2>thought in your head or do you just go</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the flow?</v>

2341
01:52:05.710 --> 01:52:07.870
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of go with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I,</v>

2342
01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:13.620
<v Speaker 2>if I feel and I like thoughts come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fit or if I find a way to do it,</v>

2343
01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:19.060
<v Speaker 2>like a thing that maybe doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily fit in with that,</v>

2344
01:52:19.061 --> 01:52:19.930
<v Speaker 2>then maybe I'll do that.</v>

2345
01:52:20.090 --> 01:52:22.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm open to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I juSt don't know.</v>

2346
01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know what that is right</v>

2347
01:52:25.211 --> 01:52:26.660
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's beautiful though.</v>

2348
01:52:26.710 --> 01:52:28.420
<v Speaker 2>You have that sensibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you can just.</v>

2349
01:52:28.930 --> 01:52:32.490
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm thinking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'd like to do right now focused,</v>

2350
01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I've been in more music studios in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past two years and have been comedy</v>

2351
01:52:36.911 --> 01:52:37.750
<v Speaker 2>clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2352
01:52:38.010 --> 01:52:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing with music?</v>

2353
01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Just kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just like,</v>

2354
01:52:42.850 --> 01:52:43.710
<v Speaker 2>just hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2355
01:52:43.770 --> 01:52:47.080
<v Speaker 2>just I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I like to talk about it and you</v>

2356
01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:48.890
<v Speaker 2>kind of discuss it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2357
01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:51.440
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been lucky enough to kind of be</v>

2358
01:52:51.441 --> 01:52:56.120
<v Speaker 2>around some artists that I admired and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just listened to that creation.</v>

2359
01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Like I like the immediacy of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>

2360
01:52:59.001 --> 01:53:00.770
<v Speaker 2>like a lot I liked it is what I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

2361
01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:03.560
<v Speaker 2>What I like about even here it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2362
01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:07.720
<v Speaker 2>it's an art space that you have here</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can kind of create like in</v>

2363
01:53:07.730 --> 01:53:11.150
<v Speaker 2>this immediate space and exactly how you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see it.</v>

2364
01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:13.370
<v Speaker 2>It comes out in that way and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>record it,</v>

2365
01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:17.180
<v Speaker 2>capture like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when your mind is in that space,</v>

2366
01:53:17.210 --> 01:53:20.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to only do things that it can</v>

2367
01:53:20.361 --> 01:53:21.194
<v Speaker 2>be good at.</v>

2368
01:53:21.390 --> 01:53:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2369
01:53:23.490 --> 01:53:26.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good year.</v>

2370
01:53:26.970 --> 01:53:30.840
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me as an outsider is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you found like your natural path,</v>

2371
01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:32.960
<v Speaker 1>you found a natural path like you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

2372
01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:35.310
<v Speaker 1>you've made it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become successful,</v>

2373
01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:38.070
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're well known now and you've got</v>

2374
01:53:38.071 --> 01:53:40.050
<v Speaker 1>freedom and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just find my,</v>

2375
01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:40.913
<v Speaker 1>what am I into?</v>

2376
01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doiNg what I hope</v>

2377
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:48.910
<v Speaker 2>like all of us are trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the oNe thing that I've always done</v>

2378
01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:54.820
<v Speaker 2>is exactly what I want to do in the car</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2379
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:57.170
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just by nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like,</v>

2380
01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.810
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I told her it's just by saying</v>

2381
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:03.620
<v Speaker 2>not doing the things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't match then not doing it,</v>

2382
01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:04.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2383
01:54:04.761 --> 01:54:09.740
<v Speaker 2>and trying to have a vision of what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is and just making that right.</v>

2384
01:54:09.741 --> 01:54:13.340
<v Speaker 2>And so like that's what like comedy at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>

2385
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the medium finds you,</v>

2386
01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:19.010
<v Speaker 2>it comes to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't go to the medium,</v>

2387
01:54:20.410 --> 01:54:24.590
<v Speaker 2>the medium is meeting you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like so many people are just like</v>

2388
01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:27.890
<v Speaker 2>conforming and just becomes the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2389
01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:28.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird time.</v>

2390
01:54:29.110 --> 01:54:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a good outsider's</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

2391
01:54:30.851 --> 01:54:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an inside of that.</v>

2392
01:54:32.231 --> 01:54:35.230
<v Speaker 1>It has almost an outsider's perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're looking at it like you</v>

2393
01:54:35.231 --> 01:54:39.370
<v Speaker 1>step back a little bit and watch all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hamster wheel,</v>

2394
01:54:39.710 --> 01:54:43.330
<v Speaker 1>watch all the scrambling</v>
<v Speaker 1>around this.</v>

2395
01:54:43.331 --> 01:54:46.410
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that men and there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake horse shit going on.</v>

2396
01:54:46.411 --> 01:54:50.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of people grabbing at straws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really noisy.</v>

2397
01:54:50.630 --> 01:54:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so many opportunities.</v>

2398
01:54:53.181 --> 01:54:56.980
<v Speaker 1>There's so many venues and so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians and it's also comedy so hot</v>

2399
01:54:56.981 --> 01:54:58.240
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2400
01:54:58.241 --> 01:55:01.960
<v Speaker 1>it's such an exciting time for standup</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's so many people doing it,</v>

2401
01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:06.040
<v Speaker 1>so you're automatically going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like when you try and out jokes,</v>

2402
01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:07.550
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2403
01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:10.510
<v Speaker 1>when you trying out comedians.</v>

<v Speaker 1>gonna make.</v>

2405
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:18.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean this might be in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>success to failure ratios,</v>

2406
01:55:18.311 --> 01:55:22.300
<v Speaker 1>one of the most brutal art forums you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could ever attempt to be a professional.</v>

<v Speaker 2>so really starting to to do it.</v>

2419
01:55:55.771 --> 01:55:58.140
<v Speaker 2>It's in the past couple of years is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really kind of hit.</v>

2420
01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:03.320
<v Speaker 2>I was on this weird kind of weird path</v>
<v Speaker 2>trajectory type of thing.</v>

2421
01:56:04.411 --> 01:56:09.411
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of was just on the side of it.</v>

2422
01:56:09.601 --> 01:56:12.780
<v Speaker 2>I feel I feel like in this weird sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>and things kind of happened and I kind</v>

2423
01:56:12.781 --> 01:56:16.110
<v Speaker 2>of found an infrastructure that worked</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me really quickly.</v>

2424
01:56:16.590 --> 01:56:18.990
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like announce around now is the</v>

2425
01:56:18.991 --> 01:56:21.000
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that a lot of things starting to</v>

2426
01:56:21.001 --> 01:56:26.001
<v Speaker 2>happen for guys that have been around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were around 500 dudeS when you</v>

2427
01:56:27.151 --> 01:56:31.650
<v Speaker 2>first started that you knew regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe three are working now.</v>

2428
01:56:31.670 --> 01:56:33.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2429
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2430
01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Legitimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you counted all the mop over the</v>

2431
01:56:37.651 --> 01:56:39.120
<v Speaker 2>first 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stand up career,</v>

2432
01:56:39.570 --> 01:56:43.880
<v Speaker 2>you've got maybe three that are doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are doing what they want to do.</v>

2433
01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:46.350
<v Speaker 2>They're doing what they want to do.</v>

2434
01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:51.870
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is that.</v>

2435
01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking brutal.</v>

2436
01:56:52.921 --> 01:56:57.240
<v Speaker 2>A lot of comedians operate in this space</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's like they don't know they</v>

2437
01:56:57.241 --> 01:57:00.510
<v Speaker 2>could do what they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big wall,</v>

2438
01:57:01.410 --> 01:57:03.420
<v Speaker 2>a big wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a lot of people stop at that</v>

2439
01:57:03.421 --> 01:57:07.470
<v Speaker 2>while people that can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are just like still trying to</v>

2440
01:57:07.471 --> 01:57:10.710
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to write the confidence</v>
<v Speaker 2>to act,</v>

2441
01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:13.090
<v Speaker 2>the confidence to act on your actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>instincts,</v>

2442
01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:17.340
<v Speaker 2>to do what you really want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so crazy because comedy,</v>

2443
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:20.820
<v Speaker 2>you think that we'd be the ones that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>closest to it because it's so</v>

2444
01:57:20.821 --> 01:57:23.970
<v Speaker 2>instinctual and in such a reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2445
01:57:23.971 --> 01:57:25.670
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of things that you do have</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a real.</v>

2446
01:57:25.700 --> 01:57:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Like when you discover your funny</v>
<v Speaker 2>through like when you discover you can</v>

2447
01:57:30.511 --> 01:57:32.920
<v Speaker 2>sing by preparing to sink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2448
01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:36.840
<v Speaker 2>you go and you prepare the singing voice</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you give it a shot and then you</v>

2449
01:57:36.841 --> 01:57:38.700
<v Speaker 2>discover you're funny by just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2450
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:39.623
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2451
01:57:40.290 --> 01:57:40.711
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2452
01:57:40.711 --> 01:57:41.151
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2453
01:57:41.151 --> 01:57:43.560
<v Speaker 2>Like you just got you a photo finish</v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken,</v>

2454
01:57:43.710 --> 01:57:45.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>

2455
01:57:45.310 --> 01:57:46.081
<v Speaker 2>It was that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2456
01:57:46.081 --> 01:57:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Or by like a hunch that you have so like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so instinctual that you would think</v>

2457
01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:54.000
<v Speaker 2>it would be more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like following your instincts,</v>

2458
01:57:54.001 --> 01:57:56.490
<v Speaker 2>following your gut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forging your own path.</v>

2459
01:57:56.491 --> 01:57:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so scary in the beginning that once</v>

2460
01:57:58.171 --> 01:58:00.810
<v Speaker 2>you find shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hold onto that.</v>

2461
01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:02.610
<v Speaker 2>That's why those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2462
01:58:02.611 --> 01:58:05.940
<v Speaker 2>the saddest comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that they do stand up for five</v>

2463
01:58:05.941 --> 01:58:07.830
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he developed a half an hour and it never</v>

2464
01:58:07.831 --> 01:58:08.790
<v Speaker 2>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
