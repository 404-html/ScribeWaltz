00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.800
Hello Freak bitches.
Welcome back.
Once again.

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.830
Matt flavors here and he's got his fucking reading glasses on.
So you know,

3
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:13.980
shit is about to very serious.

4
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.630
This episode of the Joe Rogan podcast is brought to,
I said it again,

5
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.220
is brought to you buy naturebox,
naturebox.
Uh,
one of my favorite new sponsors.

6
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.990
They make some goddamn delicious shit and uh,

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.770
send it do rectally to you for free.

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.290
If you're a one of those people that works in an office and you're,

9
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.130
you get annoyed at the fact that you don't have good LD snacks to eat,

10
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.700
that's delicious,
that you don't feel guilty about eating and you know,

11
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:42.840
the vending machines filled with crap and it's hard to fucking go to the store

12
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:46.500
and buy shit and think,
okay,
these are my snacks for work.

13
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.240
Way Easier to have naturebox deliver it and naturebox and deliver stuff that is

14
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.860
with zero trans fats,
zero high fructose corn syrup,
nothing artificial,

15
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.300
no artificial sweeteners.
They have like really healthy options.

16
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:04.260
And then they have shit like pretzels,
but which are very yummy,
very young,

17
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:09.020
not figs.
Oh yeah.
Good.
Cocoa almonds.
Have you had that?
A big apple pineapple.

18
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.930
<v 1>Yeah.
The black and white granolas delicious.</v>

19
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.100
They've got endless stuff on there that you and there's a nutritionalist

20
00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:19.650
approved.
It's fucking delicious.
Did you get the Sriracha cashews?
Yes I did.

21
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.830
Did you get the step by sea pistachio?
Yes.

22
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.740
You get stoned sometimes you're hungry.

23
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.370
You're looking for something that's the perfect fucking snack people.
Yeah.

24
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:32.710
This is one you know

25
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.660
<v 0>naturebox can set you up to,</v>

26
00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:38.950
if you have a very specific dietary requirements like low sugar or gluten free,

27
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.731
really,

28
00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:43.690
really delicious shit free shipping anywhere in the u s naturebox is busting the

29
00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:47.230
vending machines monopoly on your mid day hunger.
That's their fucking line,

30
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.790
not mine.

34
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.710
<v 2>It's really cool cause they like any kind of the snacks.</v>

35
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:09.750
They tell you right there like soy free dairy free.

36
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:14.070
They tell you like it's really well put it on their website and when you get it

37
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:17.430
sent to your house,
you don't even realize how easy that is.

38
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:18.570
That's like five things.

39
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:22.080
Just throw in your in your cupboard and then you have snacks the whole week

40
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:24.730
instead of like going to Mcdonald's or something like that.
I don't know.

41
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.990
<v 0>And good shit.</v>

42
00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:28.300
It's not like you could find this stuff at the grocery store with a fucking

43
00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:30.050
gonna Fund.
Sriracha cashews.
Yeah,

44
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.090
like they have some excellent recipes that they've concocted so I salute them.

45
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.020
We're also brought to you by Tang,
another podcast sponsor that I really enjoy,

46
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.230
but ting is a a podcast or a podcast company,

47
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.980
podcast sponsor that what they decided to do was make their own cell phone

48
00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:47.230
company rent time on sprint,
but do it their way,

49
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.190
do it their way with no early termination fees,
no contracts,

50
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.400
just sell people service on sprint.
So you know,

51
00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:57.910
you get an excellent network and give them for a choice,

52
00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:01.450
the best mobile available through android and iPhone.

53
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:06.280
Leave the iPhone five on there and instead of like the way you do it at most

54
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.420
places,
if you go to a,
uh,
one of the bigger name cell phone companies,

55
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.480
what you're doing is your rent,
sort of like leasing a phone.

56
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.930
Like if the phone costs 200 bucks,
the iPhone has cost 200 bucks.

57
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:19.510
Pitch and iPhone costs 600 bucks,

58
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.140
but you paid 200 bucks and then over the course of the years of your contract,

59
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:26.860
you pay off the rest.
They don't do it that way.
A tank,
if it says 200 bucks,

60
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.750
it's cause it's 200 bucks.
That's it.

61
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.670
We're done here that you give them 200 bucks,

62
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:33.220
they give you a phone that's a wrap.
Like you see that iPhone five,

63
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:37.570
if they had 260 bucks,
that's what it actually costs and then that shit is yours.

64
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.270
And if you want to leave you leave,
you want to come back,
come on back.

65
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:41.620
Nobody gives a fuck.
All right.

66
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:45.250
What they're trying to do is sell you an excellent cell phone service at a

67
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:47.410
reasonable price with reasonable rules.

68
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.590
And they also have it set up so you only pay for the minutes that you use.

69
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.030
If you use one minute a month,

70
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.430
that's what you pay for you a hundred a hundred minutes a month.

71
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.080
That's what you pay for.
It's,

72
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.740
that's what's going to happen in the future because all these fucking goofy

73
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.600
rules where it's like,
you know,

74
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.370
go over 120 minutes and you've got this fee because you got an overage fee and

75
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.270
all that nonsense.

76
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.890
<v 2>Can you imagine if one of the big name guys did that?</v>

77
00:04:09.891 --> 00:04:13.610
They would ruin everybody cause they're like,
oh yeah,
that makes a lot of sense.

78
00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:15.200
Let's go to this other big name.

79
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.930
<v 0>I think in the future,
this is the only way they're going to do it.
I really do.</v>

80
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.730
I think 10 is way ahead of the curve.

81
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.920
They're also ahead of the curve they had on their two year anniversary.

82
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.300
They just for no reason just decided a slash all their prices.
They're like,

83
00:04:26.301 --> 00:04:28.550
we got better deals so we're going to give better deals to you guys.

84
00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:31.880
All the prices on data.
If you're a heavy user or a heavy Internet user,

85
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.870
especially the data prices on on ting are fantastic.

86
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.050
98% of people would save money with tank 98% that's real numbers I think go

87
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.490
their website,
but they are inherently have some statistics.

88
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.910
$21 is the average monthly bill per device per 10 customers.

89
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.560
I know you pay more than 21 bucks.

90
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.330
Go to rogan.ting.com and save an additional 25 bucks off of any of those new

91
00:04:53.331 --> 00:04:54.770
delicious android devices.

92
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.770
That's Rogan dot [inaudible] dot com we are also brought to last and foremost by

93
00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:03.860
on it,
o n n I t a human optimization website.

94
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.570
What we sell it on it is all things that we have found to improve you,

95
00:05:08.571 --> 00:05:12.020
improve your mind,
improve your endurance,
improve your mood.

96
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.690
If we find things they prove to be good.

97
00:05:14.691 --> 00:05:16.610
If we look at the research and it makes sense,

98
00:05:16.611 --> 00:05:20.710
we post all that research along with references.
All this stuff that we sell,

99
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.800
whether it's the controversial things like Alpha brain and shroom tech and new

100
00:05:24.801 --> 00:05:27.590
mood,
what you're dealing with Alpha brain and new mood.

101
00:05:27.591 --> 00:05:31.430
You're dealing with these things called nootropics with nootropics are is

102
00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:35.120
vitamins and nutrients that have been shown to have a positive impact on

103
00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:38.480
cognitive function is very controversial stuff.
If you,
you know,

104
00:05:38.481 --> 00:05:39.530
you Google Online,

105
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.930
you can find people that say that vitamins aren't necessary and their bullshit

106
00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:44.750
and they don't do anything for you in nutrients.

107
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.550
All you need is what you get from your food.

108
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.830
Do you know how much fucking weird grasses and moss you would have to eat to get

109
00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:53.810
some of the nutrients that's in something like Alpha brain?

110
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.910
You're not going to get it from your food man.

111
00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.470
Like is it to have a healthy diet then just to Ed Shitty Diet and take

112
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:05.000
supplements,
ev abs off Fuckin lutely healthy diet is number one.

113
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.650
It's the most important thing,
but for optimization,
for optimization,

114
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:13.970
meaning making your body and your brain function at its very peak and it's best

115
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:15.890
when you feel the smoothest,
the longest,

116
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:19.880
the most often you can do that with supplementation better than you can without

117
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:23.540
supplementation.
This is from anecdotal evidence and my personal evidence,

118
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.780
what like my personal experience rather,
and it's also from research,

119
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:30.590
all the research available at [inaudible] dot com including our own double blind

120
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:34.700
placebo studies that we did on Alpha brain.
We did one showed positive results.

121
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:36.170
We're doing a much larger one now.

122
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.400
What we're trying to do it on it is just sell you the shit that we find that

123
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:43.310
works as far as strength and fitness equipment,

124
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.700
the strength and conditioning equipment we sell like kettle bells and battle

125
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:49.430
ropes and weight vest,
steel maces,

126
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:53.270
all these different things are great for functional strength.
No bullshit,

127
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.200
no gimmicks,
no fat loss.
Nonsense.
If we find it,

128
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.220
it's got to work before we sell it and we look into it very,
very thoroughly.

129
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:05.390
We also have a 100% money back guarantee on any of the supplements.

130

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.430
a hundred percent money back guarantee.

132
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:11.810
You don't even have to return the product.

133
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.230
We're trying to sell you the best shit we can find.

You can rotate it because I talked to Mr. Rios.

142
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.580
You can rotate the stock we're in,
so whatever you need,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.170
they'll send it to you the first of the month.

00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:51.650

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.200
Yeah,
they get on a program has been very successful.
Tremendous.
Go there.

146
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.460
Get your freak on.
Joey Diaz is here.

147
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.640

<v 0>Boom.
Shut,
lock,
lock,
boom Joe.
We motherfucking Diaz.</v>

150
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.200
What's up my brother violating state law.

151
00:08:16.201 --> 00:08:18.630
You've got an electronic cigarette in the house.
What am I going to do?

152
00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:21.390
I have a question for you by the,
uh,
while we're at it,
cause I always,

153
00:08:21.391 --> 00:08:23.490
I always have questions for you but I forgot to talk to you.

154
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.540
About a month ago somebody posted the mushrooms,
the quadricep mushroom,

155
00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:28.374
cordyceps,

156
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.960
shroom tech and they had like what this mushroom looks like in 10 years and how

157
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.840
it got fun guy.
And this is what it does to inside your system.

158
00:08:36.841 --> 00:08:40.740
That's all bullshit.
It does inside your system,
like inside your body,

159
00:08:40.741 --> 00:08:42.590
what it does and Shit.
Look,

160
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.820
there's a lot of mushrooms that people eat on a daily basis,

161
00:08:44.821 --> 00:08:48.060
like fungus as a normal part of people's diets.
W W you know when you,

162
00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:52.250
when you eat,
what if he should talk?
He mushrooms are eating a fungus right?

163
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.110
And something that's a fungus.
You know,
your,

164
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:56.550
your whole body is filled little growing organisms,

165
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.240
but no cordyceps mushrooms not going to grow inside your body and like make

166
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:03.510
roots,
create fucking plants.
They come his ass off Facebook.

167
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:06.380
They show like waters said mushrooms.
This was happened.

168
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.780
Was it a bunch of different kinds of cordyceps mushrooms to the,
the,

169
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:13.890
there's two different types in uh,
in um,
shroom tech,
sport,

170
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.870
two different types of courts,
subs,
mushrooms.

171
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.500
When you do look the shooting tech support,
it's not that you get hyped.

172
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:23.040
I don't get height.
No,
I just feel that the yet I'm like,

173
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.650
I look at the clock and like we'll usually I leave at this time when,

174
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.930
when I got one more.
Yeah.
You get an extra round or two.
Got One more.
Yeah,

175
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.080
no bullshit at me.

176
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.470
You know where it came from came from these high altitude herders.

177
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.680
They were like moving cattle around and they found that these,
these,

178
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.010
when these animals would eat these certain mushrooms,
they'd be noticeable,

179
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.540
noticeably more lively.

180
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.990
So they realize like it's probably something to do with oxygen production.

181
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.870
This is like,
I guess if you go to certain places of the world,

182
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:52.410
it makes sense that there are certain foods that would be good,

183
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.700
that grow in that to help you deal with certain aspects of the environment.

184
00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:59.580
That's challenging.
You know,
like high altitude,
you know,

185
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.120
it's like you go to Denver,
it's fucking,
you go up the flight of stairs.

186
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:06.150
I was like,
whoa.
That's like whenever they have a UFC card and Denver,

187
00:10:06.151 --> 00:10:08.610
I'm always like,
all right,
here we go.
Fucking.

188
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.900
They had Ben Rothwell and Mark Hunt Two dudes not exactly known to be

189
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:17.350
triathletes,
go fight in Denver.
And it was a crazy fight,
man.

190
00:10:17.351 --> 00:10:20.490
I was just a ridiculous,
crazy white.
We're both guys almost died.

191
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.920
They don't both almost had heart attacks to fighting.

192
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:25.170
If 5,500 feet above sea level,

193
00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:28.090
you weight 265 fucking pounds go to hell.

194
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.830
How much do you have to how long before it says,
it says six weeks to acclimate.

195
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.200
Yeah,
Walt.
They said,

196
00:10:33.201 --> 00:10:36.870
but I don't think I talked to a guy who lived there who was a triathlete and he

197
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:40.510
told me that he moved there for his training.
Right.
That's,
yeah,
like the,

198
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.570
like a lot of those endurance athletes move there.

199
00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:45.180
He was in boulder and he told me it takes three years,

200
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.830
three full years before your body's like,
like right.

201
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:52.320
The white how you are right now.
If you're in Burbank,
boom,
right now,
Joey Diaz,

202
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.070
you would have to to get to be this level of comfort with your breathing

203
00:10:56.071 --> 00:10:58.350
environment and with the,
the oxygen level in the air.

204
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.990
It would take you approximately three years to get 100%,

205
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:05.000
but you get pretty close within the first five windows.
Fighters go to Dennis,

206
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.450
how long do they go?
Two weeks.
There's a lot of debate on that.

207
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.110
What they're thinking now is that what you should do is not train at altitude.

208
00:11:13.111 --> 00:11:16.620
What they think now is that you should train at sea level but then sleep at

209
00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:19.260
altitude.
So if that's the case that you don't have to go anywhere.

210
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:22.860
Like Bj Penn had one of those tents that he would set up in his house and when

211
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:24.070
he was,
we'd go to bed at night,

212
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:29.020
he would sleep in this oxygen tent and it was like a,
it's simulated,
uh,

213
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.400
being at high altitude.
So that's what guys are using now.

214
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.030
They're using these tents.
It was funny because Bj set it up and it goes,

215
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.550
it was really funny.
As he was setting it up,
he goes,
he goes,

216
00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:40.780
when I got to sleep in a tent,
someone's getting their ass kicked.

217
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.770
He's setting up this fucking plastic tent in his living room.
You know?

218
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.220
It's a wild,
I was just in Utah and Salt Lake City.

219
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.430
That also has elevation.
You don't remember.

220
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.390
<v 4>You just go out and do this.
This BJ sleeping in a tent.
Back it up.
Set Joe.</v>

221
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:03.100
He could see it.
Is that pat coming?
I got it.
I got it
as it.
Who is he?

222
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.070
I don't know.
He's just talking football player.
Oh yeah.

223
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:08.590
A lot of guys do this now.
They sleep and he's fucking tense.

224
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.210
I know when they play football in Denver,
that's murder.

225
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.610
When people come and visit,

226
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.520
they got a flight on Monday and they get to practice the whole week.

227
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.331
The NFL does.

228
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:20.110
You don't cause you to do because you got to do something just to acclimate.

229
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.130
You gotta ramp up for that.
Chet,
you can.
You should.
You should ramp up your,

230
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:26.290
your training and your cardio beforehand.
Anyway,

231
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:28.420
just to deal with the fact that you're going to like just,

232
00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:30.670
some guys don't have to do anything.
They're just in such good shape.

233
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.040
They get up to Denver there,
they deal with it a little bit,

234
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:35.020
they feel it a little bit,
but they're in such good shape.

235
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:35.960
They could just push forward.

236
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.710
It's amazing when you walk around the city of boulder per se,

237
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:39.950
and you walk around,

238
00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.400
you're there for six weeks and you've got acclimated and everything or whatever

239
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:47.401
they say and you start getting used to it and then you go skiing and that's what

240
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:49.920
you really find because that's a level on the,

241
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.670
on the mountains that it's just brutal.

242
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.780
It's just fucking brutal killing 11,000 feet and you get up there and here's the

243
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:56.501
fucking crazy thing.

244
00:12:56.501 --> 00:13:00.370
A lot of people decide to eat up there and that's when you're in trouble.
Really.

245
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.130
Your body can't have that.
Your body can't handle no shit.

246
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.690
Little Wall up at uptown,
I'm talking to,
I pay 11,000 you could ski down it.

247
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:08.410
That's fine.

248
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.410
We skied and we get to the bottom and go up and you get your momentum and your

249
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:12.244
ski and you get,

250
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.760
it's when people stop up there and they hang out for an hour and they eat,

251
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.020
they got out the tubes,
sickness,
high altitude,
you know,

252
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:21.010
is a high altitude sickness.
It's a motherfucker.
It's like beating see sake.

253
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.760
Really.
It's like being seasick.
You just want to lay down and it makes sense man.

254
00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:28.510
Yeah.
Cause uh,
living at 8,500 feet,

255
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.250
you like when you go up a flight of stairs,

256
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.360
like anytime you go up a flight of stairs,
you gotta go,
Ooh.
Like I've never,

257
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:36.580
I never go up a flight of stairs and take a big deep breath.

258
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:38.980
But in boulder only take a big deep breath.

259
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:43.240
And you can imagine that like if you go higher than that,
go like 11,000,

260
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:48.250
like 8,000 to 5,000.
There's a big difference.
So I gotta imagine 11,

261
00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:50.200
it's like some next level,
next level shit.

262
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.380
And it's crazy because when you're up there for a while,
you're tired.

263
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.320
Like you don't have to do anything.
Just talk to people up there.

264
00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.510
It just puts your body through something.

265
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:02.410
Cause the first time I moved to Colorado,
I didn't go to bolt.

266
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:07.150
I went to Aspen and all I felt like doing was sleeping.
And I would say 10.

267
00:14:07.151 --> 00:14:10.630
I don't even sleep now at 50 right.
Paint.
I didn't fucking sleep.

268
00:14:10.631 --> 00:14:14.830
We slept man for like three weeks.
All I could do is fucking sleep.

269
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.440
I couldn't take it no more.
Wow.
It was just that happy.

270
00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:19.000
I passed out up there smoking pot.

271
00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:23.950
The first time I took a big old bong hit picking me up off the fucking floor.

272
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.160
First Day in Aspen on a Sunday morning,
afternoon,

273
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:30.190
I went to some people's house over.
Uh,
it was Galina's street.

274
00:14:30.191 --> 00:14:33.490
They had an apartment.
I went up there,
blah,
blah blah.
I want to do a bong.
Yeah,

275
00:14:33.491 --> 00:14:37.720
I'm a tough guy.
Boom.
Bam.
Bumping the head.

276
00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:42.040
Ice Cubes in your head.
Fucking tremendous.
We had a catch,

277
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.440
a fear factor executive.
Uh,

278
00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:47.620
in New York we had a catcher because she passed out on the street,

279
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.320
stepped outside of a bar.
This is after September 11th.

280
00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:52.010
It was the coolest time to be in New York,

281
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.570
<v 0>man.
Everybody was so god damn friendly.</v>

282
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.200
It was like less than a year since the attacks and we're filming make maybe a

283
00:14:57.201 --> 00:14:59.900
year,
I don't know.
I want to say it's 2002 somewhere.

284
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:04.160
And so we're standing outside of this,
uh,
this bar and a,
I go,

285
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:06.380
who wants some of this?
Come on pussies.
Who wants some of this?

286
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:09.950
I pulled out a joint and a,
they got crazy.
They got Kinda it.
We'll do it.

287
00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:12.200
We'll do it with you.
I'm like,
oh my goodness,
you guys are fucked.

288
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.110
Like they don't have any idea like nonsmokers have no,

289
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.180
I mean they might have smoked weed a little bit in college.

290
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.910
You don't know what the fuck you're getting into if no idea how crazy the suite

291
00:15:20.911 --> 00:15:22.460
is.
Oh my goodness.

292
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.150
So she took one hit and she's standing there and then just see her eyes,

293
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:30.080
like slowly start to roll back and I see her body given and then we just rushed

294
00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:34.760
in and Carter were like,
whoa.
And then we called the ambulance.
No,
you did.
Yeah.

295
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.270
Yeah.
It didn't know what was going on.
She had had a few health issues too,

296
00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:41.390
so we're a little worried like something might be going on other than the weed,

297
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.390
you know.
So we,
we called her call an ambulance for,

298
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.920
but it's weird watching someone black out from weed.
You know,

299
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.700
<v 2>I told that story about that one person in college that uh,</v>

300
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:55.360
she took one hit of a joint or a bong or whatever it was.

301
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.950
She stood up and just start running as fast as she could into the bathroom and

302
00:15:59.951 --> 00:16:02.830
trips over the bathtub and smashes her head into the wall.

303
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.140
And she had no idea why.
She just said,

304
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.330
she said to her body just took over and she couldn't,

305
00:16:07.331 --> 00:16:09.580
she didn't know what she blacked out and she just started running.

306
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.470
That should be the commercial.
We not for everybody.

307
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.390
<v 4>Not Anymore.
Nothing's for everybody,
but anymore.
Nothing's for everybody.</v>

308
00:16:18.391 --> 00:16:22.980
Including,
you know,
fucking cats.
Yeah,
I know.
I know.

309
00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:25.620
Ladies are allergic to chickens.
She's like,
I love chickens,

310
00:16:25.621 --> 00:16:27.690
but I'm allergic to them.
What the fuck are you talking about?

311
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.620
You're allergic chickens.
How are you allergic to chickens?
How's that?

312
00:16:31.621 --> 00:16:35.730
Even happen.
Can even pick up a chicken show.
I was a kid.

313
00:16:35.731 --> 00:16:38.970
I was allergic to dogs like a motherfuck.
I mean really doctor,

314
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.700
I had to go to a doctor if I had contact with a dog,
but you know,

315
00:16:41.701 --> 00:16:44.340
like that now over the years I just kept playing with them.

316
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.500
I couldn't live like that.
I couldn't live like that no more.

317
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.660
That's when she was doing horrible way to live.

318
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.350
If I went to some of these houses,
child,
they had a collie or something.

319
00:16:52.351 --> 00:16:57.150
And when you were kids like,
yeah,
I couldn't fucking touch this college.

320
00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.000
You know when you were a kid and somebody got a colleague,
that's it.

321
00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.450
It's lastly motherfucker.
That's as good as it gets.

322
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.960
And My godmother had a collie and my mom go,
you can't go in the house.

323
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.510
I got a fucking going out house.
I got to see him.
They called him last.

324
00:17:09.511 --> 00:17:13.160
He and I would hug him and an hour later my eyes would be like fluff.

325
00:17:13.161 --> 00:17:17.340
And I got punched in the face.
Both of them.
Wow.
And they make me wash my hands.

326
00:17:17.341 --> 00:17:18.720
After an hour,
they go to the hospital,

327
00:17:18.721 --> 00:17:21.550
they put some whatever and I am and they telling me not to fuck with a dog.

328
00:17:21.551 --> 00:17:22.560
So I pay eight times.

329
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.580
I should have brought dogs with my fucking phone and my side.

330
00:17:26.581 --> 00:17:30.180
When I was a kid from getting bit,
I got bit in the face,
I got bit in the leg,

331
00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:35.030
I got,
I kept getting bit.
Goldman pinches,
kept biting me.
German shepherds,

332
00:17:35.031 --> 00:17:39.720
dogs bite kids because kids are grabbed their face.
No,
I never harassed my fear.

333
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.500
I had such a fear of that.
And then,
uh,

334
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.380
one time I'm like Spanish Harlem and the guy used to walk past me every day in

335
00:17:46.381 --> 00:17:50.760
the summer and he had two dogs and would say,
don't share a lot of my dogs,

336
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.710
you know,
don't talk to my dog.
And we go,
okay.

337
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.270
Cause I was trying to work over the fear.

338
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:57.210
I knew that somebody said you got to play with them.
If not,

339
00:17:57.211 --> 00:18:00.000
they're gonna keep biting it.
And probably after a summer,
one day,

340
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.430
I didn't say hello to the dogs.
The dogs are both buying.

341
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:06.030
The female came back and bit me in the fucking leg.
She was saying,
hello.

342
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:11.510
I talked to him.
So this is not time.
Like I haven't been scared of dogs.

343
00:18:11.511 --> 00:18:14.600
I know at all.
What are some people that have bad dogs though?

344
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.880
There's some people that just have pet dogs.
They don't,

345
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.300
they didn't take care of their dog.

346
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.860
They raise a shitty dog and the dog's dangerous.
That's a fact.
Listen,
man,

347
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.490
uh,
dogs just,
you know,
they don't know.
They don't fucking know.

348
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.680
I don't fucking know.
You know,
you can't.

349
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.490
Every day we hear about a dog attack or some shit,
you don't fucking,
well,

350
00:18:32.491 --> 00:18:33.360
it's weird.
We're living

351
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.960
<v 0>with animals.
We've got this weird animal that we allowed to live with us.</v>

352
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.850
And you know,
it protects you,

353
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.810
which means what protects you means it protects you from other people.
I mean,

354
00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:45.960
one of the last time you heard about a dog protecting someone from an animal,

355
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:48.870
it's pretty rare,
right?
They're protecting you from other people.

356
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.240
And so you've got a dog that's trained to by people,

357
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:55.830
which is very strange animals that you have around you that are essentially like

358
00:18:55.831 --> 00:18:59.720
trained weapons trained to go after people like when people have those attacks.

359
00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:03.300
Shepherds remember when George Foreman George Foreman fought Muhammad Ali.

360
00:19:03.301 --> 00:19:07.680
He brought his German shepherd to Zaire and it was this big deal because the

361
00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:09.450
black people that lived there,
the ad,

362
00:19:09.451 --> 00:19:13.770
the actual Africans that live there fucking hated German shepherds because

363
00:19:13.771 --> 00:19:16.020
German shepherds of the dogs and the cops had got upset.

364
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:21.050
So they saw George Foreman as like the enemy and Muhammad Ali played on that

365
00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:22.500
like a motherfucker.

366
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.370
He played on that like a motherfucker and realized that George had fucked up by

367
00:19:26.371 --> 00:19:30.720
bringing this German shepherd with them to Africa and that's where the Ali boom,

368
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.930
ba,
ba boom,
ba.
A lot of that had to do with

369
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:39.690
<v 4>the fight in Africa.
Just him.
Yeah,
in the Philippines,
he fought Joe Frazier,</v>

370
00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:42.990
Frazier in Manila,
the Thrilla in Manila.

371
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.330
That's the place where he pointed the gun at them from the bottom.

372
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.750
Joe's Fraser's on his balcony and shit getting decided.
Mohammad Ali.
He said,

373
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:52.830
Joe Frazier,
and he pointed like,
I started this pistol at him.
Did he really?
Yeah,

374
00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:56.190
it's crazy.
You know,
Molly was crazy in a funny way.
You know what I'm saying?

375
00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:59.910
Like,
he was crazy.
In a funny way.
What was that year was,

376
00:19:59.911 --> 00:20:03.300
we know that video I showed you a James Brown the first time I came in your

377
00:20:03.301 --> 00:20:08.300
pocket.
That's where the video was taken because it was George Foreman.

378
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.950
It gets Muhammad Ali.
Don King said,
wait a second,

379
00:20:10.951 --> 00:20:15.420
I ain't stealing enough on this fight.
I might as well get a musical performance.

380
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:18.300
Get a bunch of motherfuckers out here steal from them too.

381
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.890
And I just robbed a bunch of black people all at once.
Right,
right.
So he robbed.

382
00:20:22.891 --> 00:20:27.540
He got the spinners.
He got,
uh,
he got James Brown.

383
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:32.010
He got all of these black bands to go to fucking Zaire and perform as a music

384
00:20:32.011 --> 00:20:36.870
festivals.
Sally at Cruise,
he got to find the all stars.
He got,
uh,
who,
uh,

385
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.960
he got like just all these black bands and what happened?

386
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:44.550
He probably just stiffed me.
Shit.
He probably just stepped them through.

387
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.410
He's like,
I didn't make enough money,
then they're going to cancel that fight.

388
00:20:47.411 --> 00:20:48.310
We weren't thinking something

389
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.520
<v 0>was wrong with that fight.
I don't know.
Look it up.
Something happened.</v>

390
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:55.120
It was going to get pushed back.
Oh really?
He had the music already set up.

391
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.800
It's very interesting that that uh,

392
00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.870
they made a movie about it called sole power and that's a,
sorry,

393
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:06.790
who's that guy that says lovely day?
Lovely day bill withers.
I don't remember.

394
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.500
Yeah,
Bill withers is in that,
uh,
in that movie.
Fucking tremendous.
That was a,

395
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:16.070
they made a documentary about that fight too,
right when we were kings.
Yeah.
Yeah.

396
00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.540
Watch though.
Watch like pieces of it.
I never watched the whole thing.
Good.

397
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.360
Not Bad.
You know,
as much as you could watch those.

398
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:25.960
But there's a great picture of Muhammad Ali were bill with his,
you know,

399
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:27.820
he got that sings all those great love songs.
You don't,

400
00:21:27.821 --> 00:21:30.910
I'm telling him about bill withers and he's got his shirt off in Africa.

401
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.810
He the fucking steak and eggs and Mohammad Ali's just dropping knowledge,

402
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:37.900
talking,
you know,
about the fight and Bill Williams is next to him.

403
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:40.960
And he won't look up.
He's just eating this fucking steak.

404
00:21:40.961 --> 00:21:44.350
It's so yummy for your tummy.
He won't look no shirt on.

405
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:46.450
Bill with withers fucking tremendous.

406
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.320
That was the one that don king's first fights.
Was it really?
Yeah,

407
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:54.430
it's apparently one of his first ventures as according to Wikipedia as a

408
00:21:54.431 --> 00:21:55.630
professional boxing promoter.

409
00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:59.620
And he managed to get Ali and foreman to sign separate contracts saying they

410
00:21:59.621 --> 00:22:03.160
would fight for him if he could get a $5 million purse.
So,

411
00:22:03.161 --> 00:22:06.640
and then he took that and then he went to this other company,
had to go to a,

412
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:09.310
an outside country for the event because he didn't have the money.

413
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.520
So a xy years president ready for this name.

414
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:16.610
Mobutu Sese Seko uh,

415
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.950
asked if the,

416
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.280
the fight could be held in his country and eager for the publicity from such a

417
00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:24.340
high profile event,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And uh,

418
00:22:24.341 --> 00:22:27.040
they put together a bunch of different investment.
Um,

419
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:31.480
different companies invested,
some Panamanian Investment Company,
British company,

420
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:35.200
a bunch of different companies and they all coughed up the cash and threw it

421
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.670
through it together.
What a fucking fight.
That was too.
That was Jesus Christ.

422
00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:41.990
What a fucking fight that was.
That was one of them.

423
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.490
I'm Mohammad Ali's greatest performances ever because nobody thought he was

424
00:22:45.491 --> 00:22:47.080
gonna win.
Nobody.
Nobody.

425
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.240
People don't understand what [inaudible] 72 brothers 74 wow.

426
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.630
People don't realize what a mother Fucker,
George Foreman was back then.

427
00:22:55.930 --> 00:23:00.220
He was a motherfucker.
You hit hard and he was like a silent Ali,

428
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:01.780
like you didn't do a lot of talking,

429
00:23:01.781 --> 00:23:06.781
but he was just subbed to the Max who was so dangerous when he fought Joe

430
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.770
Frazier and picked him up with a punch.
He hit Joe Frazier so hard.

431
00:23:11.771 --> 00:23:14.890
He went up into the air.
He was just a different thing.
You know?

432
00:23:14.891 --> 00:23:17.050
Joe Frazier was no walk in the park.
He fucking,

433
00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:21.630
only three dudes put some scary fucking heavy weights.

434
00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:25.130
I think Joe Frazier is a really scary guy with that fucking left.
Okay.

435
00:23:25.131 --> 00:23:29.140
Is it hits you like a fucking bomb?
Yeah.
He had,

436
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.590
it was like a moving oak.
Yeah.
He was tremendous.
He could die.

437
00:23:32.591 --> 00:23:35.980
It's hard to do that,
like to just come up like that by,
by,
by Bam.

438
00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.710
He would throw his whole body,
his whole body.
I never see
that hooked.

439
00:23:40.711 --> 00:23:45.010
Did he knocked Muhammad Ali Down with oh one picture.
Perfect Punch.

440
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.480
He would just swing into that.
Right?

441
00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.750
<v 1>Even if he knew it was coming.
Yeah.</v>

442
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.650
Even if even the ones you show him ducking light that once you show him taking

443
00:23:52.651 --> 00:23:56.430
that little step back,
a little crotch,
whatever,
that's all he would do.
That shell

444
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.350
<v 0>to that Philly shell where you put like one hand up,</v>

445
00:23:59.351 --> 00:24:02.740
one hand down and bobbing and weaving and coming in and weapon shots.

446
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.280
Joe Frazier was a motherfucker.
Sad wasn't we used to go to Philly.

447
00:24:06.281 --> 00:24:09.380
We used to drive passage.
Jim,
I'm away from the APP.
What?
That neighbor,

448
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:14.290
he lived at his gym before he died.
Yeah,
he went broke and the end,
look,

449
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.000
the amount of money that these guys make for the time,
look,

450
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.890
they're talking about $5 million persons for Ali informant for the time.

451
00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:23.650
If you have $5 million back then that is a lot of goddamn money.
But guess what?

452
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:25.870
You live like you've got $5 million,

453
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:30.780
so you're buying fucking Cadillacs and paying for this and paying for that and

454
00:24:30.781 --> 00:24:33.280
meals here and jets there and next thing you know,

455
00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:36.220
$5 million doesn't even make it to the 80s and you know the

456
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.570
<v 1>brothers is showing up at the door.
But my young last motherfucking cousin,
yeah,</v>

457
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.870
<v 0>listen man,
we got to venture and this mother fucker can't go wrong.</v>

458
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.450
White neighborhood first year going to make 30% of your investments.
Second year,

459
00:24:50.451 --> 00:24:54.980
60% on,
you know that's Matt and it just hit you with some crazy speech.

460
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:59.390
How many of those do you ever had to deal with?
Three.
Oh,

461
00:24:59.391 --> 00:25:02.780
you got them all the time.
How to deal with one recently movies,

462
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.650
TV shows,
you get them constantly.
Ear beatings.

463
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.210
I even come,
he said,
man,
I'm not a movie producer.
All you have to do

464
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.620
is give us a check and we'll do the whole,
you don't have to do anything.

465
00:25:15.621 --> 00:25:18.480
You don't have to worry about it.
Yes I do.
I have to worry about it.
No,
no,
no.

466
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.770
You don't have to worry about it.
No,
no.
I do have to worry about it.

467
00:25:20.771 --> 00:25:22.130
If I give you money,
I'm going to worry about it.

468
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:25.640
Get out of here where your crazy idea does the reason why they have banks.
Okay,

469
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.310
go to the bank.
If you have a really good idea and you have credit,

470
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.870
go to the fucking bank.
If you don't have credit,

471
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.470
I got to assume somewhere along the line you've already made some poor fucking

472
00:25:33.471 --> 00:25:36.710
choices.
I don't want to be involved in that.
People have this,

473
00:25:36.711 --> 00:25:38.450
everybody has this idea that they,

474
00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:43.130
they're gonna figure out how to circumvent this time honored system of
Hollywood.

475
00:25:43.131 --> 00:25:46.180
And we're going to get to Joe Diaz.
If I can get to Cho Diaz.

476
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.080
I know Judy has been killing it on the road.

477
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:51.710
If he can give me just $2,000 and I could start this film.

478
00:25:51.711 --> 00:25:53.430
You Know Quentin Tarantino does his barn.

479
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.920
Ryan and Kevin Smith made clerks and man,
man,
man.

480
00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:00.890
And they just think that all they need is a couple grand from Joey Diaz,
Joe,
Joe,

481
00:26:00.891 --> 00:26:04.940
Joe,
Joe.
You can't go wrong.
Okay?
Nobody makes movies.
Okay,
join.

482
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:06.230
They just don't want me in.

483
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:10.730
They don't want me and Joey take don't want me and Joey d as they want to keep

484
00:26:10.731 --> 00:26:11.570
me on the outside.

485
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.690
<v 1>No,
you get them for your time.
It's not even that you get them for money.</v>

486
00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:17.780
It's you get them for your time.
Yeah.
Look at you when you're living through you.

487
00:26:17.781 --> 00:26:21.110
You're busy.
Yeah,
you're swamp.
There's no more no more.

488
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.840
I keep telling people that and they get mad at me.
They don't understand.

489
00:26:23.841 --> 00:26:27.020
When you have children,
there's no schedule.
I can't count on my schedule,
Bro.

490
00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:31.160
At 10 20 she wouldn't get off my fucking lap watching one,
two,

491
00:26:31.161 --> 00:26:35.180
three videos on youtube at 10 30 I went to pick her up like,

492
00:26:35.181 --> 00:26:39.080
let's go with what?
What will you fucking talking about?

493
00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:40.130
Like I'll be back in a couple of hours.

494
00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:41.370
They didn't know what the fuck that means.

495
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:44.040
You don't have no fucking idea what it is to,

496
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.970
<v 4>and I went to get to go into the room at nine 30 I get out of it.</v>

497
00:26:47.971 --> 00:26:51.020
I was going to get out of there early.
That little bitch opened the gate.

498
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.190
I heard those stomping and like this.
There's no argument.

499
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.570
She just puts her hands up,
got to pick her up,
got to put youtube on.

500
00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:02.710
I got to sit there with a one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
you know,

501
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.530
and then she again,
Daddy.
Okay,

502
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.130
well the problem with people asking you to do things too is that you kind of do

503
00:27:08.131 --> 00:27:09.510
this shit for yourself.
Okay?

504
00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:14.511
The way to do it is not to go through other people and ask people to pick you up

505
00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:18.500
and help you.
That's not how it works.
It doesn't work that way and pay.

506
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:21.570
Everybody thinks you're gonna figure out some fucking choke shortcut cause they

507
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:24.720
know you or they know this guy or that guy.
This.

508
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.710
There's no shortcuts in creating something.
Just figure it out.
Bitch.

509
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:33.870
I love standup because there's one part of me that doesn't need anybody.

510
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:38.790
Are these a notebook right here?
This is my tools for standard and a person,

511
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:43.380
but go,
go to Bob's fucking coffee house on North Hollywood and do three minutes.

512
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:46.310
You know me,
I don't give a fuck.
When you,

513
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.710
we talked about having a band that somebody came on here and said that it was

514
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:52.620
the toughest thing in the world for a band to stay together.

515
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:54.750
You got four people personalities,
you know,

516
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.700
you get these people that come to you and I,

517
00:27:56.701 --> 00:27:58.920
and I was breaking it down from another planet.
They don't say,
hey Joe,

518
00:27:58.921 --> 00:28:02.190
how you doing?
My name is this,
read my script for you.
Like it.
Yeah,

519
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.190
we're going to get $8 million.
And then you go,
okay,
when you get it,
call me.

520
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.550
I really liked the script.
Something you're interested in,
whatever,
three days,

521
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.070
all of a sudden you do get a call in the ELA and they say,
hey,

522
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.180
we're making a movie,
but guess what?
We didn't get $2 million.

523
00:28:15.181 --> 00:28:18.720
We've got $200,000 so instead of you getting 10,000 a week,

524
00:28:18.721 --> 00:28:21.390
you're going to get a hundred a day and it's going to be a hit.

525
00:28:21.391 --> 00:28:22.290
We're going to make it happen.

526
00:28:22.291 --> 00:28:26.010
Nine out of 10 they run out of money for marketing and editing and the whole

527
00:28:26.011 --> 00:28:30.140
fucking thing.
So your movie ends up in Youtube.
They don't have a legit schedule,

528
00:28:30.141 --> 00:28:32.430
so you have to work Saturdays and fucking Sundays.

529
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.590
You know those people that are involved in those low rent movies,

530
00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.810
they're a fucking nightmare and it's their dream and I get,
it's your dream,

531
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.410
but don't include me in this fucking thing because you want me to do everything

532
00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.030
cheap on my end.
All the hours and it's your fucking dream.

533
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.240
If it's that much of your dream,
and do me a favor,
if forget got the 200 gs,

534
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:55.170
we're getting another 300 gs and make this fucking work.
Well,
not only that,

535
00:28:55.171 --> 00:28:57.570
you can find other actors out there that will do it for cheap.

536
00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.240
There's people that are out there that just want to ask sort of like a comic

537
00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:01.440
would go to an open mic night.

538
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.010
There's certain actors that just want to do something to put it on a real go

539
00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:05.461
find them.

540
00:29:05.461 --> 00:29:08.220
There's a lot of talented people out there that are not working as far as like

541
00:29:08.221 --> 00:29:11.310
acting goes.
There's a lot of fucking people that can do it.

542
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:16.030
There's a lot of times of gay people.
It's just the,
I just have a problem.

543
00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.390
People like asking you to help them do it.

544
00:29:18.391 --> 00:29:21.270
Like I get it from comics all the time too.
Just looking for a break.

545
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:23.190
What are you talking about?
This you're not,

546
00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.320
you're not going to get a break from another comic.

547
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:27.810
The way you get breaks is by going on stage and being funny.

548
00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.000
Like go to an open mic night.
Be Funny.
The club will say,

549
00:29:30.001 --> 00:29:33.440
Hey Joey Diaz your fucking funny.
We would like you to come here more often.

550
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.390
The audience really enjoyed you.
Next thing you know,
some manager says,

551
00:29:36.391 --> 00:29:39.650
you know what Joey Diaz,
you're really funny.
We would like to,
uh,

552
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.010
think about taking you on as a client.
That's how it works.

553
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.320
<v 0>Like a comic coming along.
It's not going to make you funnier.</v>

554
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:46.540
And then the people that do that,

555
00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:49.750
they always have a distorted perception of how good they are already.

556
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.630
You know those,
those kids that are asking for a break,

557
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.060
the kids that want you to help him,
hey man,
I just need a break.

558
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:58.480
If I could do a guest set for you.
It really helped me like this.
Not you don't,

559
00:29:58.481 --> 00:30:01.060
you don't go to the Doug Stan hope show and asked for a fucking guests.

560
00:30:01.061 --> 00:30:02.380
All our Doug,
we'll probably put you up,

561
00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.890
Doug Pyrite do 15 and started to go up front.

562
00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:08.710
Doug will push Apokyn,

563
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:12.550
open micro and his first time on stage he'll do that in front of like a crowd in

564
00:30:12.551 --> 00:30:14.620
Norway or something.
But that Stan Hope,

565
00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.650
<v 4>you know,
uh,
it's not normal.
You have to do you.
I,
it's,</v>

566
00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:23.400
it's amazing what people,
you know,
we weren't like that.
Thank God.

567
00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:26.430
We knew that this took work and heart.

568
00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.920
We knew that this wasn't going to happen in one night.

569
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.830
I was old enough already when I started.

570
00:30:30.831 --> 00:30:34.500
I was long in the tooth already that I knew this was just not going to,
you know,

571
00:30:34.501 --> 00:30:37.980
you just didn't walk on stage and things happen and people come here and they

572
00:30:37.981 --> 00:30:40.230
called desperadoes where they just do,

573
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.570
don't come up to you for a guest and you got to ask him,

574
00:30:42.571 --> 00:30:44.000
what is this going to do for you?
Right.

575
00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.870
I was just going to fucking change your life.

576
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:49.680
It's like I've never been too much of a hanger rider.
I don't believe in that.

577
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.220
I never believed in that shit.
You know?
I believe in doing the spot.

578
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:55.440
If I go to the comedy store,
it's because I'm doing the fucking spot.

579
00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.800
If I don't go to,
I don't go to the Improv and my name isn't on that list.

580
00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:03.240
The hangout.
There's no for me,
there's no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

581
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:07.710
Because if you come up to Joe Rogan,
red band or Jamie and go,
Hi Jamie,

582
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:11.940
my name is Joey Diaz.
I'm a fucking cop.
I'm a funny comment.
Jamie's going to say,

583
00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.870
are you going up tonight because we all want to watch it.
I love to laugh,
right?

584
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.890
You're funny.
Let's go.
No,
I'm just here hanging out.
You ain't that fucking funny.

585
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:21.660
If you're not on the list,

586
00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:24.120
you ain't that fucking fun or they don't know about you yet.

587
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:28.950
There's a possibility that certain people that go to the Improv,
that's it,

588
00:31:28.951 --> 00:31:31.110
and they'll tell you,
dog,
you've got a network.
What network?

589
00:31:31.111 --> 00:31:35.310
Your network on a stage.
I net work on stage when they laughed when I walk off.

590
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.980
That's networking.
Not only that,
when you're a comic,

591
00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.060
you're sort of like a fruit or a vegetable.
In that year,

592
00:31:41.061 --> 00:31:43.650
you're growing and then you're going to one day you're going to be ripe and when

593
00:31:43.651 --> 00:31:44.020
you're gonna be

594
00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.110
<v 0>right,
everyone's going to know about it and people find out about you.</v>

595
00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.350
If people found out about everybody,
they found out about you,

596
00:31:50.351 --> 00:31:52.250
they found out about Hinchcliffe.
They find out about everything.

597
00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:55.310
<v 4>Yearbook,
Dunkin,
you what happened?
Like what's happening in China right now?</v>

598
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:59.420
What's happening in China?
I was packing them in,
Oh yeah.
Every night.
And he goes,

599
00:31:59.421 --> 00:32:03.320
I can't believe it was white people and UFC fans.
I in China,

600
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:07.430
they're coming from money out.
Yeah.
Okay.
They're not big rooms.

601
00:32:07.431 --> 00:32:10.850
There are 120 seat and you can see this is like coffee shops,
right?

602
00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.900
But where on the Internet,
this shit is worldwide.
Worldwide.
Yeah.
This is,

603
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:18.830
we can't believe it that there's fucking people walking around here going,

604
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:20.570
we came to see you from Macau.

605
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.660
I can't believe it took people so long to figure it out or he's a fucking
genius.

606
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:28.250
He's a great comic.
It's,
uh,
it's just amazing that people have misled.

607
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.670
They think they're shortcuts.
We got here.
What was the shortcut?

608
00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.270
If you get on the tonight show,
right?
That's it.

609
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.850
How many people have gone to the tonight show and I'm not great success.

610
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.980
No one cares.
A lot of peat now it doesn't.

611
00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:44.300
<v 0>No,
but back in the day it meant something big.
You know,
Steven Wright days,</v>

612
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.750
you get on Letterman.
That's it,
man.
You're fucking Roseanne Barr,

613
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.730
who you had on the show recently.
You know who,

614
00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:54.620
who's a perfect example of a guy who paid his dues and who's just out there

615
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:57.510
silently murdering Ian motherfucking Edwards.

616
00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:02.370
Fucking about words is killing people.
Don't know.
Ian Edwards is one of the

617
00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:08.780
country,
one of the very best,
like not,
not like top 30.

618
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:13.220
He's like top 20.
Maybe even top 15.
He's a murderer.
Dude.

619
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:18.110
He killed me the other night at the Improv.
Killed me.
He's very subtle,

620
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:23.030
subtle,
and Suffolk.
Perth jokes are perfect.
The perfect structure.

621
00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.940
It's like he's got a perfect inflection.

622
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.250
So he's slick and Hillel like loose and relaxed.
Sunstone like,

623
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:34.070
where's he going with this?
And he comes back with a left hook.
Lastly though,

624
00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:36.860
late Joe Frazier,
he's a killer dude and he's so,

625
00:33:36.861 --> 00:33:40.430
I liked his voice because he's his boy skills.
That's what I like about.

626
00:33:40.431 --> 00:33:45.310
And that's his strength is how small he is.
He's got a new,
um,
uh,
yeah,

627
00:33:45.311 --> 00:33:49.220
it's on,
it's on Conan O'brien's record label.
It's the first one.

628
00:33:49.221 --> 00:33:52.100
It's called 100%.
Halfassed it's really funny,
man.

629
00:33:52.101 --> 00:33:56.930
He's fucking really good right now.
I've known Ian since the nineties.
Dude,

630
00:33:56.931 --> 00:34:00.350
I knew Ian in the early,
I think I knew him in 1990.

631
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:02.640
So think about value for years.

632
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:07.040
I've known that dude for 2023 I know,

633
00:34:07.041 --> 00:34:09.320
I knew him when I lived in New York and that was like,

634
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:13.760
I think I moved to New York in [inaudible] 91 so I knew him from then one of

635
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:18.320
this week.
Great Guy.
Always been a great guy.
I always been a great guy.

636
00:34:18.321 --> 00:34:22.700
Like can't,
can't say enough good shit about that dude.
And he's a Vegan.

637
00:34:22.701 --> 00:34:26.450
I don't even give a fuck.
He is.
Yeah,
he's a vegetarian.
It had very,

638
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:31.220
very least a vegetarian dude's awesome.
So I got to shit in a cup on Friday.

639
00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:36.410
So they said,
well three of these.
What a segue.

640
00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:38.750
By the way,
I've done that.
Shouldn't have come yet.

641
00:34:38.751 --> 00:34:40.060
Three different little kind of tests.

642
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:43.320
You have to put pieces of poop in three different ones.
What's it that for?

643
00:34:43.321 --> 00:34:48.290
It's disgusting.
Why would I want to shit somebody at a fucking,

644
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.630
that's disgusting.
What did they testing it for it?

645
00:34:50.631 --> 00:34:53.870
Cause they tested me for a tape.
Worms come from bad Sushi.
No,
everything.

646
00:34:53.871 --> 00:34:57.920
I'm going in for the 50 and then the fourth I got to drink a potion for a day

647
00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.570
and veggies,
water,
water,
water,
water there.

648
00:35:00.571 --> 00:35:04.010
Monday or 6:00 AM I go to Wilshire to see the Sinai,

649
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:05.620
that gimme anesthesiologist.

650
00:35:05.621 --> 00:35:08.390
They put a camera up my ass hole that make sure there's nothing,

651
00:35:08.391 --> 00:35:11.450
and then they pull it out.
And then you have to have,
so you have to fart once.

652
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:14.060
Once you fly,
you're good to go.
They let you go.

653
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:18.060
Have you ever had a dog that had worms?
Yes.
Yeah.

654
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.890
Have you ever seen it and their poop?
Yes.
White things moving around thing ever.

655
00:35:21.891 --> 00:35:23.750
Man,
I had a dog.
She had uh,

656
00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.470
she had worms and when she would poop you would like see it out of her ass.

657
00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:31.640
Like it was on the edge of our little booty hole.
That'd be like little worms,

658
00:35:31.641 --> 00:35:35.060
like twisting and tweaking around and they fall off.
It was disgusting.

659
00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:36.330
She had to get,
uh,

660
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:40.320
some anti warm medication and kill everything that was inside of her.
Yeah.

661
00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:44.130
I thought my current dog had it because every time she shits she wipes her ass

662
00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.030
and after she shits,

663
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:47.670
he just like rubs her butt on the grass and then it takes off.
And I'm like,
oh,

664
00:35:47.671 --> 00:35:51.490
that means she has worms.
But she's,
sometimes it's just the itchy,
but yeah.

665
00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.500
Does it seem,
does your budget sometimes once a dog figures out,

666
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:58.620
they could rub their ass on the carpet.
That's gotta be pretty God dynamic.

667
00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.930
They get those toes up in the air,
you know,
that move,

668
00:36:00.931 --> 00:36:03.930
like they're doing yoga and then they just started fucking not,

669
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.820
but along with the little toes he's up.

670
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:10.980
Does your cat just nonstop puke all the time and cat is taken to this new habit

671
00:36:10.981 --> 00:36:15.870
of shitting and weird rooms in the house.
Yeah,
it's disgusting.
Like,
Oh yeah,

672
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.830
she's 18 years old.
She's really,
she got,
they get dementia too.

673
00:36:19.831 --> 00:36:20.820
She doesn't know what's going on.

674
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:23.280
I should mention miles in the middle of the night,
in the middle of the night.

675
00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:24.530
She knows.
Know where she is.
She just says,

676
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:30.000
and you come out and you like think she's dying.
Like why?
She's like,

677
00:36:30.001 --> 00:36:32.970
well you're like,
hey fuck head.
Don't be waking me up.

678
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:38.200
Waking me up like you're screaming and yelling the middle to
this sweet,

679
00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.670
sweet cat.
She's very needy men.
Very needy.

680
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.250
Like where I want to get some work done,
sit down in my office.

681
00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:46.560
Sometimes I have to put her out in the hallway cause she'll just keep hopping in

682
00:36:46.561 --> 00:36:49.790
my lap.
I'm like,
listen bitch,
I got to work.
But she looks at you like you're,

683
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.810
you're free massages.
No did.

684
00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:56.070
She doesn't like anybody else in my house either because she doesn't like my

685
00:36:56.071 --> 00:36:59.610
little kids.
You know?
And she remembers my stepdaughter is a little kid too,

686
00:36:59.611 --> 00:37:02.210
so like she's no little kids.
Like,
she's like,
yeah,

687
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:06.120
they'll fuck out everybody out,
out everybody out.

688
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.340
She doesn't want to have nothing to do with kids.

689
00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.130
So like she just runs away from everybody in the house but me.

690
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.450
So when I'm not home,
the pitches hides,
she's hot.
She's like,

691
00:37:15.451 --> 00:37:18.840
where is this bitch?
Like if I'm,
if I'm on the road for like five days,

692
00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:21.720
she's like,
what the fuck is going on here?
Where is this asshole?

693
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:26.140
So as soon as I come home,
lets me
follow me around and circles.

694
00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.460
I have a black gay love.
I can't,
what do you have fucking,

695
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:30.870
I've had her since she was a baby.

696
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.120
She was a little tiny kid and I got it from my sister.

697
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.800
My sister had a cat and the cat got fucked by some wildcat.
They lived in,
uh,
the,

698
00:37:37.801 --> 00:37:42.570
uh,
outside of Boston suburbs,
like Pr,
you call it the suburbs,

699
00:37:42.571 --> 00:37:43.470
but it's pretty rural.

700
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:47.220
Like they had coyotes and shit and they had raccoons would tear apart their

701
00:37:47.221 --> 00:37:51.990
trash and they'd wildcats.
A lot of wild cats like feral cats are pretty common.

702
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:56.040
Um,
but there were people's pets,
you know,
there were wild but they weren't,

703
00:37:56.070 --> 00:38:00.300
you know,
they weren't like dangerous wild cats like farm cats.
They were just,

704
00:38:00.301 --> 00:38:03.820
people let their cats out.
The cats would go run around.
Fucking so were,

705
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:06.720
it was old school.
Cat gave birth in the middle of the kitchen.

706
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:10.560
They put it in the box,
shut out some kittens and she had all these kittens.

707
00:38:10.561 --> 00:38:13.980
I took one of them and that's Bas.

708
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:17.790
If she is 18 years later,
she's like,
she's fine.

709
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:21.540
Like I think Mrs Rogan probably wanted her dead a while ago.

710
00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.600
Shit in various spots in the house.
But that kind of going nowhere.

711
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:29.270
Mine's doing that.
Asa Mitzi shore.
That cat died.

712
00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:35.320
She came to the comedy store the other day if she did or my cat.
Yeah.

713
00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:39.150
I guess she just came in and she stayed in the car.
But,
uh,
yeah,

714
00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:44.250
she was alive and it seemed like she was good enough to get it on a car and

715
00:38:44.251 --> 00:38:48.170
stuff.
I didn't say it,
but my friend Justin for young comics place,
she's just,

716
00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:48.990
just,

717
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:51.570
if you find out that she's going to be there and just go there to stare at her.

718
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:52.441
Yeah.
Cool.

719
00:38:52.441 --> 00:38:54.930
Little stare at one of the most important figures in the history of comedy.

720
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:57.870
Draw her.
Just go look at her.
Just so you could say,

721
00:38:57.871 --> 00:38:59.820
I saw Mitzi Mitzi shore in real life.

722
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:04.050
You should do that because she ain't gonna be here forever.
That,
that ladies,

723
00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:08.310
one of the most important figures ever in comedy.
If it wasn't for her,

724
00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.120
I would have never without a doubt,
never been the same comedian.

725
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.990
I wouldn't be at this table.
I would have been gone by now.

726
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.090
I would never been the same.
She that,
that lady,
uh,

727
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:22.110
she threw me into the fire trial by fire every time there's anybody,

728
00:39:22.111 --> 00:39:24.300
anybody good at the comedy store?
Martin Lawrence,

729
00:39:24.301 --> 00:39:25.980
when he was in his prime doing movies,

730
00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.810
guess who's going on after Martin Lawrence right here.

731
00:39:28.811 --> 00:39:33.080
A kid go up there to eat a fat play to dicks and learn how to do standup.

732
00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:37.100
<v 1>We'll be behind Paul Mooney for a year
at midnight.</v>

733
00:39:37.101 --> 00:39:39.410
The really till I met my wife,
I said a lot

734
00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.770
and give you all three is fucking proxy,

735
00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:48.710
but destroying my fucking breaking me down.
I mean that's how I got back up.

736
00:39:48.711 --> 00:39:51.500
By doing blow,
I would leave dead depressed.

737
00:39:51.501 --> 00:39:54.170
I'm going to have to do a fucking rock just to get back.
All right,

738
00:39:54.171 --> 00:39:56.940
I got another hope.
I got them on and I looked at who am I following?

739
00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.820
Even if it wasn't a j,

740
00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:02.720
whatever was in front of the HTA would cancel an aga would be if it was a

741
00:40:02.721 --> 00:40:05.750
fucking nightmare.
Guys,
it was a mall.

742
00:40:05.751 --> 00:40:09.350
Was Sue squeaky clean,
squeaky.

743
00:40:09.351 --> 00:40:11.980
God Damn Polaris.

744
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.670
<v 0>Hilarious,
beautiful timing.
It was hard to go on out.</v>

745
00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:18.150
<v 1>Oh,
it was like driving to Jujitsu.
You're going to die.</v>

746
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.370
Why am I even doing this shit?
Why the fuck am I going here?

747
00:40:21.371 --> 00:40:24.770
I'm just going to be on bottom and stuck all fucking day.
I'm going to do debt.

748
00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.840
By the way.
I got to ask you a question with y'all animals.

749
00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:29.580
I know you don't watch it,

750
00:40:29.581 --> 00:40:33.030
but you gotta watch this shit cause it's going to affect you.
I watched that.

751
00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.270
A real sports with buffer.
Bruce Buffer,

752
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:41.670
and you see the story before that you see about the horses,
how they juice it.

753
00:40:41.671 --> 00:40:46.290
If you think Vandelay and chair with juice to the fucking nine,
what they'd do.

754
00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:49.590
You know how many horses died at aqua duck race trail alone in January?

755
00:40:49.591 --> 00:40:52.940
This she just from steroids,
26 well that's what

756
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:54.510
<v 0>all those still like echo poise.</v>

757
00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:58.530
Remember equipoise bodybuilders would take that is a horse stair equity.

758
00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.000
It's like whore equine

759
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:04.310
<v 1>about Horace Mann with people doing this year.
Right?
I didn't know that.
Steroids,</v>

760
00:41:04.311 --> 00:41:05.630
my brother look it up.

761
00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:09.700
That'd be on like quantics Equinix that give them Decca,

762
00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:14.300
the Roblin for Germans that give her,
yeah,
about 26 horses on one month.

763
00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:17.510
Four weeks divided by 26 that's a lot of,

764
00:41:17.511 --> 00:41:20.210
and then that I watching this and I don't have to go to the track.

765
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:23.600
I had to go to the Santa Anita that Saturday for a kid's thing.

766
00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:26.570
They paint your face in the middle and they think the kids on horses.

767
00:41:26.571 --> 00:41:28.580
I was looking forward to him like,
you know what?
I ain't going.

768
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:32.170
I told my wife and my,
I'm boycotting that shit.
I sat and she gets,
Joey,

769
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:34.370
you've got to,
you already made commitments

770
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:36.710
<v 0>to kids.
I went up there,
third race,</v>

771
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:40.790
fucking horse died fucking noise back on the track and shit.

772
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.120
The heart attack.
Did it fall down?
They just bro,

773
00:41:44.121 --> 00:41:46.370
they just dead dying on the track.
They getting hot.

774
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.660
They've just juicing them to the gills.
Gills brow.

775
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:50.810
Speaking of juice to the gills,

776
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:55.250
pull up that video that I put on my Twitter page yesterday about the strong man

777
00:41:55.251 --> 00:41:59.600
guy breaking his back.
See that he didn't break his back.
Apparently he's okay.

778
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.580
What apparently is okay?
He,

779
00:42:01.581 --> 00:42:05.900
his body failed in the middle of lifting what they call an atlas stone.

780
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:09.330
An atlas stone is like a,
a globe,
like a giant glow,

781
00:42:09.331 --> 00:42:12.440
but it's a rock and it weighs like 300 plus pounds.

782
00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:17.150
And this guy's hoisting this rock up onto these pedestals and he's in the middle

783
00:42:17.151 --> 00:42:18.650
of hoisting this rock up on the pedestal.

784
00:42:18.651 --> 00:42:22.820
And I guess he blacked out from the strain.
I guess he was straining so hard.

785
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.550
That was like,
he was getting choked because like,
he didn't have any oxygen.

786
00:42:25.551 --> 00:42:29.600
His brains,
it's just
boom,

787
00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.830
he falls down and it's fucking huge.
Boulder lands.
I'm looking at this dude,

788
00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:38.580
check this out.
Look at the size of this fucking boulders.

789
00:42:38.581 --> 00:42:41.020
She's hoisting it up.
It's trying to get it up there.

790
00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.460
Call fucking nine one one right now.
Why is that funny?
Why you laughing?

791
00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:00.160
Cause I,
I won't watch the video,
but I was watching show

792
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:11.720
we should have been a Joey the whole time.
Oh my God.
It's that crazy.
The guys.

793
00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:13.420
Okay,
the guys.
Okay.
Um,

794
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:17.210
everybody thought that he broke his back and that was the title of the video.

795
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:21.760
But apparently what happened was he just blacked out and really,
um,

796
00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:25.910
had nothing but cuts and bruises.
Um,
even went on to finish the event,

797
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.390
which is crazy,
you know,
I don't know how the fuck the guy did it.

798
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:32.540
Maybe 300 plus whatever the fuck it is.

799
00:43:32.541 --> 00:43:35.900
Pound huge thing landed on his body.

800
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:38.060
I don't know how the hell you survived that.

801
00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:41.330
Can I ask you some steroids questions?
Sure.
Is Deka still relevant?

802
00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:44.240
Do people still do all these steroids I talked about from the 80s,

803
00:43:44.241 --> 00:43:48.290
like Anna Var and winstrol lists.
I'm sure if you're in bodybuilder circles,

804
00:43:48.291 --> 00:43:50.970
you know it's not for MMA fighters to,
and when Emma vape MMA,

805
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:55.190
MMA fighters get popped for more than anything is testosterone.

806
00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.400
Just because you can get regular testosterone now.
So easy.

807
00:43:58.401 --> 00:44:02.120
There's so many people that are getting testosterone replacement therapy

808
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:04.760
prescriptions.
They'll like,
it's Kinda a lot behind you.

809
00:44:04.761 --> 00:44:08.290
There's something to the sentence.
The last three is a more,
I probably more,

810
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:12.080
probably more chiropractice fucking making a killer.

811
00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:14.360
Chiropractice they're the ones who do it the most.

812
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.550
They what prescribed test should do is,

813
00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:18.740
what they do is they get a doctor in house.

814
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:22.160
You get some slub like a medical marijuana doctor.
He's retired,

815
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:26.690
his wife at the lottery.
You ever go to a medical marijuana doctor?

816
00:44:26.691 --> 00:44:29.330
They're all over 60.
I wouldn't fit in grade one.
The bladder pill.

817
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:32.970
They don't give a fuck.
They've already been sued 80 times.
When I give a fuck,

818
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.930
you're not going to get sued for this shit.
Like that one guy that gives us that,

819
00:44:35.931 --> 00:44:39.930
we'd prescriptions that has that uh,
office in Hollywood and he's the best.

820
00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:40.591
He's the best.

821
00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:43.570
He's the one that shows up with you and fights the court and tells him to suck

822
00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:45.720
his dick.
I know he died and he went to jail.
He went to jail,

823
00:44:45.721 --> 00:44:47.550
got lost his practice and went to jail in the 90s.

824
00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:50.910
He was one of the first adopters.
But uh,
that,
you know,

825
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.940
what were you talking about?
Oh,
the chiropracticy

826
00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:02.640
I brought it.
I didn't smoke,
but I did eat a half a cookie.
I hear him.

827
00:45:02.641 --> 00:45:06.840
Don't get me wrong.
I did eat a little half.
I'm a fan.
So,
uh,

828
00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.900
uh,
what you do is your partner up with a doctor.
You put her in the office,

829
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.270
you go upstairs,
you draw blood,
you come downstairs a week later,

830
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.460
you're low on testosterone.
Yeah.
You need a real doctor.

831
00:45:20.461 --> 00:45:21.870
Do that because you need to get all your,

832
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.000
if you're going to fuck around like that,
you got to get all your,

833
00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:27.600
your levels measured.
Your thyroid level measured your IGF.

834
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.320
I mean they're real duck,
this Joe and they know what they're doing.
Yeah.

835
00:45:31.321 --> 00:45:32.011
They send you to,

836
00:45:32.011 --> 00:45:34.680
they do all the paperwork and you go upstairs with the tasks and then they read

837
00:45:34.681 --> 00:45:39.330
it to you.
They prescribed the blockers.
They prescribe everything all at once.

838
00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:40.260
It's just you're working,

839
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:43.440
you're working very closely with the chiropractor and the chiropractor is not

840
00:45:43.441 --> 00:45:45.930
some guy who walks around with sandals.
Right.

841
00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:49.560
This guy is six foot six 292 pounds.

842
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.050
Fucking 90% yeah.
If I show you this chiropractor,
you're going to go,
oh yeah.

843
00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.340
That's the man,
mother fucker.

844
00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:03.660
Chiropractice that's a very controversial science if you want to call it a

845
00:46:03.661 --> 00:46:06.960
science practice,
you know,
some people believe in wholeheartedly.

846
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.570
Some people think it's total horse shit.
Have you sat with them for awhile,

847
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.910
they'll sell it to you.
I got a good car.
I have a good,

848
00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.970
I have a good financial Carol,

849
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.300
but he has a bunch of things in his office that I also like.

850
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:21.000
He has like a really good massage therapist.
He works on stretching with people.

851
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.040
It was like he's big on posture.

852
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.440
Like a lot of things that I know about posture come from him.

853
00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:30.240
Like he explains it and like some no bullshit terms and he,

854
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:34.290
he also explains like,
like your whole like when people stand,

855
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.940
this is what's wrong with slumping.

856
00:46:35.941 --> 00:46:38.280
I always thought slumping just looks sloppy and he goes,
no,

857
00:46:38.281 --> 00:46:42.720
it's putting undue pressure on certain areas is our spine.
Your spine,

858
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.880
when you sit up straight and you're standing up straight,

859
00:46:44.881 --> 00:46:48.570
your spine supports itself in a straight line,
but anytime you move head forward,

860
00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:51.330
you're putting all this pressure,
like an uneven point,

861
00:46:51.331 --> 00:46:54.450
like in the middle of your back you bought essentially we're supposed to be
like,

862
00:46:54.451 --> 00:46:56.880
dogs are supposed to be walking on all fours.
You know,

863
00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.880
there's a reason why it chimps.
Most chimps walk on all fours.
It's like,

864
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:00.990
and they don't have backaches.

865
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:04.710
It's like it's a better way of moving when human beings start standing up.

866
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:09.090
Apparently the flaws in the design of the back began to surface like we're not

867
00:47:09.091 --> 00:47:09.660
done yet.

868
00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:14.310
Like w eventually the body as it stands right now with this back issues that

869
00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.900
most people have from picking things up,

870
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.830
most likely the body's going to evolve over the course of the next million years

871
00:47:19.831 --> 00:47:23.430
or so and it probably be a much stronger version of a back in the future.

872
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.920
Now the kettle bell training has helped you back.
Oh yeah,
for sure is it says,

873
00:47:27.921 --> 00:47:31.150
it basically says about people's backs and when you start kettlebell training,

874
00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:35.030
you're back becomes,
they use this word resilient.
Yeah,
well the,

875
00:47:35.031 --> 00:47:39.430
you get muscle all the,
the whole look,
if you feel someone's back,

876
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:43.030
if you go and like feel the actual back muscles themselves,

877
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:46.690
if you have more stronger back muscles supporting your spine,

878
00:47:46.691 --> 00:47:47.530
it just makes sense.

879
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:51.730
If you practice proper posture and you have more muscle and stronger muscles

880
00:47:51.731 --> 00:47:55.180
supporting the core of your body,
then you can resist movement.

881
00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:59.290
An unexpected movement like say like in Jujitsu class or something like that.

882
00:47:59.291 --> 00:48:02.530
If like you get yanked to side back and forth cause stronger,
your core is,

883
00:48:02.531 --> 00:48:04.590
the more you're protected from that.
You know like,

884
00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:07.450
like if you wrote with a guy who's got a really strong core like judo guys

885
00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:10.240
specifically,
you can't move those fuckers around man.

886
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:12.130
Their core is so God damn strong.

887
00:48:12.131 --> 00:48:14.590
So if you're trying to like lean against their core,

888
00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:18.580
compress their core to like either flipped him over or to sweep them their

889
00:48:18.581 --> 00:48:21.400
chorus.
So God damn strong.
It's like their pillar,

890
00:48:21.401 --> 00:48:23.380
the what connects their body together.

891
00:48:23.381 --> 00:48:27.040
It's just check it through that fucking thing.
Wrestlers,
same thing,

892
00:48:27.041 --> 00:48:30.370
especially Greco Roman guys,
their upper body in their course,

893
00:48:30.371 --> 00:48:34.660
so fucking strong from throwing bodies around all the time and that's sort of

894
00:48:34.661 --> 00:48:38.250
what kettlebells mimic.
Just throwing things,
picking things up,

895
00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:43.180
hoisting things with momentum,
all of that stuff.
That all builds core.

896
00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.580
That all builds what everybody likes to call core.

897
00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.970
But people do sit ups and leg lifts and Shit.
Get the fuck out of here with that.

898
00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:53.800
You don't need that.
He needed heavy kettle bell swing.

899
00:48:53.801 --> 00:48:57.130
Those mother fuckers impress him and do windmills.

900
00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:00.960
That's where you get strong core weight.
Lowe's,
Dwight,
Dwayne Wade though,

901
00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:04.400
boy Cruz to reps work increased the work.
Okay.

902
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.760
The more you do five you gave me,
you listen,

903
00:49:06.761 --> 00:49:11.420
you can do 45 pounds for an hour or you can do 55 pounds for 40 minutes.

904
00:49:11.421 --> 00:49:14.860
What it's all in,
how much you put in versus how much you get out.

905
00:49:14.861 --> 00:49:18.640
But as far as for health benefits,
when you go heavy,

906
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:23.680
the problem is you risk injuries.
When you go like 55 pounds,
70 pounds,
90 pounds.

907
00:49:23.681 --> 00:49:27.470
Once she gets that gets a little squirrely because your hoist and a lot of God

908
00:49:27.471 --> 00:49:30.190
damn weight and you're carrying it and all these fibers and tissues,

909
00:49:30.191 --> 00:49:34.030
you straining when you're doing like 55 pounds or 45 pounds,

910
00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:38.710
it's not that much weight.
So you can get in a lot of reps and you get exhausted.

911
00:49:38.711 --> 00:49:39.270
Like

912
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:42.090
<v 1>that's what I do.
I get to the point where at the end of my forms,
stocks,</v>

913
00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:46.730
what's my form starts to stop.
I stopped out at 14 uh,

914
00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:50.430
at like I do,
I try to do 10 sets of swings.

915
00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:55.530
Infinitive Lee,
you know,
times 12 sometimes I'll do nine and I rest a minute.

916
00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:56.770
I'm going a minute time.

917
00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:01.590
Then I do another 1416 that I rest a minute,

918
00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:06.320
another 1215 I go with my body,
right.
Once I get that,

919
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:11.630
once I do 10 of those 40 fives I do just single ones and I do 15 of those like

920
00:50:12.721 --> 00:50:15.870
seven one and I switched it to eight and the other and vice versa.

921
00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:17.003
Still with a minute,

922
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.880
but the time I get to the 14th one I could feel my form and starting to fade.

923
00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:21.920
That's when it's sold.

924
00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.490
I pick up the two 35 and I walk around the block like I can't take it no more.

925
00:50:25.491 --> 00:50:28.040
I'm a farmer workout.
That's good for my posture.
That's

926
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.500
<v 4>it.
That's great workout.
Listen,
I read,
I read it cause tanks to be,</v>

927
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.460
I hang out with you.
I have a friend who has a coach and he goes,

928
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:38.930
the thing about kettle was the forgot that's 50 the less is the better,

929
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.270
but go with your body.
It tells you.

930
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.120
So they started a program at his place now five days a week,
kettlebells,

931
00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.100
20 minutes a day,

932
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:51.380
you guaranteed 10 pounds in one month to lose certain die and they'd go there.

933
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:54.710
Certainly I just haven't been able to go cause I have it on the road Thursday,

934
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:57.380
Friday,
Saturday,
but I'm home the next three weeks and I'm going to work on it.

935
00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.840
I'm going to go in there.
You can either go at night or in the morning,

936
00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:04.700
20 minutes.
It's just,
it's great work,
great work for your body.
When you,

937
00:51:04.701 --> 00:51:06.650
when you do it,
it's a combines.

938
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:10.730
All the benefits that you get from lifting weights with all the benefits that

939
00:51:10.731 --> 00:51:13.900
you get from doing cardio.
You can get it all together in one movie.
It just,

940
00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:15.440
you're forcing your body and do shit.

941
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:19.310
And if you do the workout that you're talking about right there,

942
00:51:19.311 --> 00:51:21.440
that's a good word.
It's a very good workout.

943
00:51:21.441 --> 00:51:23.930
And then I like how you're ending with the farmer's walks.

944
00:51:23.931 --> 00:51:26.140
I opened up at the farmer's walk.
That's a good way to Warren.

945
00:51:26.141 --> 00:51:30.310
I am with the farmer's walk.
I walk,
I get loose by put them down.

946
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.590
I arrested him and pick them up and just walk to as much as I can.

947
00:51:33.591 --> 00:51:38.540
Sometimes I make it to Burbank Boulevard.
Oh really?
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Why not?

948
00:51:38.541 --> 00:51:40.700
It's 10 o'clock at night.
I'm not doing nothing.
Why not?

949
00:51:40.701 --> 00:51:44.210
If somebody gives a mug and I liked doing them,
I brought in the mornings.

950
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:47.510
I parked my car in front of my house,
go on my truck.

951
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:51.710
I got to kettlebells and my trunk got to boxing gloves,
I Shin guides.

952
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:52.870
I got a yoga mat.

953
00:51:52.871 --> 00:51:56.240
That's awesome because sometimes I'll go to fucking north Hollywood park.

954
00:51:56.690 --> 00:52:00.500
That's why I think I got,
I killed my meniscus.
Was that North Hollywood?

955
00:52:00.501 --> 00:52:04.790
Because I had walked that thing and then do the kettlebells and they got that

956
00:52:04.791 --> 00:52:07.670
one hot corner over there.
That's always 150 degrees.

957
00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:12.440
I don't know what it is about Hollywood park that it's beautiful to walk is

958
00:52:12.441 --> 00:52:16.190
beautiful,
but there's a dip with a son.
Even at night it's shines.

959
00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:22.010
Even at night the sun shines that and it is fucking 140 in that corner.

960
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:25.500
But yeah,
I carry,
I liked it.
I liked to do the kettlebells outside.

961
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:29.360
When I do them inside,
I get anxiety.
I get hot.
I can't breathe.

962
00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:30.770
I do on my side under the sun.

963
00:52:30.771 --> 00:52:34.890
I blast him out like from nine 15 to 10 o'clock I'm done for the day though.

964
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:38.020
My body's burning shit all day.
You know what I just got from my kettlebells,

965
00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:43.040
but a bowling ball carry on bag for an airplane because you can carry 50 pounds.

966
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:45.800
You take 50 pounds with you and check it.

967
00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:49.100
So that checked his fucking cannon ball.
I throw it in there.

968
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:53.780
I'm the TSA is going to shit their pants.
They tried to pick up this little bag.

969
00:52:53.781 --> 00:52:58.020
It's that big.
It weighs 50 pounds.
A great fucking idea,
man.
Check it it.

970
00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.050
Just check it and they get mad at you.
But whatever.

971
00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:04.790
I bring a 35 55 I'll bring her 35 35 is good.

972
00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:08.900
Look that Keith Weber Kettle Bell Cardio workout that they saw it on it,

973
00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:13.040
35 pounds,
you'd do it.
It's a tremendous workout and just you just keep going.

974
00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:16.670
He just keeps going just over and over again.
All in the beginning.

975
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.850
First couple of minutes,
it's kind of easy,
but then you get five minutes in,

976
00:53:19.851 --> 00:53:21.740
six minutes and you're like,
oh shit.

977
00:53:21.741 --> 00:53:25.340
And you realize you've got to do this for 40 fucking minutes.
Holy

978
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:29.760
<v 0>things.
You think it would be easier?
Clean press with 35 pounds.
It's nothing,</v>

979
00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:33.000
right?
Not when you're exhausted,
when you're exhausted,

980
00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:34.950
when you keep telling your legs are on fire the next day,

981
00:53:34.951 --> 00:53:38.640
barely be able to touch your toes.
Like Ah,
ah.

982
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:40.620
So you can travel with one of those,

983
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:43.080
throw that video on and have a great workout.

984
00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:48.060
But for most people with the most important thing is just building up slow.

985
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:51.270
Don't try to get it all like,
I haven't worked out in five years.

986
00:53:51.271 --> 00:53:55.500
So today I'm fucking running the mountain.
I'm going to do click.
No,
no.

987
00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:59.400
Go light to a little bit of work today,
but be consistent.
That's the key.

988
00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:04.470
Be consistent like little bit of work.
One day.
Re Relax,
rest a little bit more.

989
00:54:04.471 --> 00:54:08.910
Workout the next day.
Relax,
rest,
chart your progress and then what you said,

990
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:09.900
listen to your body.

991
00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:14.100
<v 1>Well,
I could finally do a technical,
get up a Turkish,
get up.
No,</v>

992
00:54:14.101 --> 00:54:15.460
a technical get up and Jujitsu.

993
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:19.290
I can finally do it after a year of practice of it in hotel rooms.
Five a day.

994
00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:21.900
I would do on my right side.
The fact that you know I'm a nut thug.

995
00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:25.680
You do know him.
Retarded half where people know that I'm a little stupid.

996
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:27.810
I'm Geeky,
I don't like,

997
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:32.610
I don't like being bad at something and since we got the comedy work ethic,

998
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:36.090
I know that you could turn anything.
His wife,

999
00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:40.080
it's just something if you just keep showing up.
Yeah.
If you just,

1000
00:54:40.081 --> 00:54:43.020
you don't like the major.
Jitu has been,
I sucked Joe,

1001
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:47.990
but I could finally do the whole gym hip escape.
That fucking,
I'm a black belt.

1002
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.470
The HIPAA scapes to me today.
That's what I do.
I'm a hip escape expert.

1003
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:57.360
That's what I work on.
You know?
Uh,
if it's games a huge fucking,

1004
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:59.160
when you learn how to do it for six months,

1005
00:54:59.161 --> 00:55:02.460
I didn't know what I was doing and then Salami taught me sometimes all just

1006
00:55:02.461 --> 00:55:04.450
taught me a different and I put it all together,

1007
00:55:04.451 --> 00:55:07.890
how my shoulder and now at least I could pick up my ass and push it all the way

1008
00:55:07.891 --> 00:55:11.310
back for me.
Those are little things,
you know,
I wish I was better,

1009
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.920
but I know if I keep going to Jujitsu twice a week,

1010
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.870
which is what my body can handle.

1011
00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:18.960
Eventually I'll get somebody in an arm bar eventually.

1012
00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:20.750
Cause I got funny with Combi.

1013
00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:25.480
I was no fucking just slip Magoo in the beginning I said whatever.

1014
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:29.790
I just kept showing up.
You just got to keep showing the fuck up.

1015
00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.740
That's half of life.
That's how for life and who gives a fuck.
I want,

1016
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:36.210
I'm not looking for a black belt.
I'm not even looking to go to beat nobody up.

1017
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.820
I'm just looking to go to learn how a Turkish get up.

1018
00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:41.070
I could do with 10 pounds of Turkish get up.

1019
00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.230
I'm up to this point where I put my arm down.

1020
00:55:43.231 --> 00:55:46.740
I put my knee up and I just go up to my elbow and I go down and I do tell her

1021
00:55:46.741 --> 00:55:49.760
that was bro Bop,
bop,
bop.
I don't even go off,

1022
00:55:49.761 --> 00:55:53.430
but I've been doing it for eight months.
Kettlebells 10 pounds,
Turkish get up,

1023
00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:57.510
bitch,
but I'm still doing it right.
What would happen if I woulda took 35 pounds?

1024
00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:00.870
You know me dog.
I get that.
I wouldn't be here right now.

1025
00:56:00.871 --> 00:56:03.490
My shoulder would be at my fucking Hylo,
so,

1026
00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:07.680
but at least I know this going in because because of the lesson I got from

1027
00:56:07.681 --> 00:56:11.330
comedy that it don't matter.
Don't just keep showing up.
Yeah,

1028
00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:16.320
but nobody lasts him.
Dog.
Keep showing him.
Some people,
you tell them stay home.

1029
00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:21.690
Some people just don't want man.
For some people it's like me.
When we did comedy,

1030
00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:27.130
that was eight who had a chance.
That was another six who were funny,

1031
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:30.460
but they had day jobs because they were married or had children.

1032
00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:35.320
Then you had two people do as a hobby that every once in a great while they

1033
00:56:35.321 --> 00:56:40.240
drove to a Gig and then you got three people that just had mental health issues.

1034
00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:43.960
Yeah.
Okay,
so he showed up every week and they were nice enough,

1035
00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:48.550
but she knew there was something wrong there and for them it was the way this is

1036
00:56:48.551 --> 00:56:51.150
for me with Jujitsu,
I'm not looking for them.
You,

1037
00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:55.600
they're not looking to be on NBC.
All they want to do is one time in their life,

1038
00:56:55.601 --> 00:56:58.480
make somebody laugh.
How special is that?
It's huge.

1039
00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:00.850
And they go down there and you miss those guys.

1040
00:57:00.851 --> 00:57:04.240
I missed those guys from my scenes and see how he'd been here and that way

1041
00:57:04.241 --> 00:57:08.050
there's people that you see them and they're a pleasure to talk to because they

1042
00:57:08.051 --> 00:57:13.000
don't want an agent.
They don't want to be on movies that just having fun.

1043
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:15.910
They work at universal city in the daytime as the hope.

1044
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:20.890
<v 0>You know?
There's very few of those [inaudible] appreciate that.</v>

1045
00:57:20.891 --> 00:57:24.040
I respect that man.
But I did very,
there's very few of those.

1046
00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:27.670
Most of those guys have dreams that just never manifested themselves,

1047
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.540
but a lot of them never material.
I met a lot of guys that bro,

1048
00:57:31.541 --> 00:57:32.830
they were proud of their job.

1049
00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:36.880
They just thought somewhere in their life that they could be a standup and they

1050
00:57:36.881 --> 00:57:38.740
just didn't want to die without trying it.

1051
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:42.160
And then they did it and it become addicted.
How many people go to Jujitsu?

1052
00:57:42.161 --> 00:57:43.350
It becomes addictive.
You know,

1053
00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.080
standup definitely becomes a dick and that becomes addictive.

1054
00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:49.300
It becomes addicting and it's like addicts where you see those guys that are

1055
00:57:49.301 --> 00:57:50.111
scrambled outside,

1056
00:57:50.111 --> 00:57:52.840
they can't wait to get on stage and like even guys who are bad,

1057
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:56.020
they'll see a guy who's up there killing like you'd be up to their killing.

1058
00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:59.470
Like man,
he's supposed to only be doing 15 minutes,
motherfuckers at 20 minutes.

1059
00:57:59.471 --> 00:58:01.780
Like what do you care?
What are you going to do?

1060
00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:04.180
You're going to go up after Joey Diaz,
what are you going to do?

1061
00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:07.600
You're an open miker and you're upset.
Like they think somehow or another they,

1062
00:58:07.690 --> 00:58:10.420
while I'm on the non paid regulus but you're not getting up until two in the

1063
00:58:10.421 --> 00:58:13.720
morning.
You know how it works.
This is what you do.
You're on a non paid,

1064
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:16.930
I was a non paid regular.
You get up after everybody else.
That's what you do.

1065
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.910
If there's anybody

1066
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:20.030
<v 1>craziest that people should know this,
you want to,</v>

1067
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:24.230
you were on a TV show and you wouldn't pay regular,

1068
00:58:24.231 --> 00:58:25.970
which by law if you're on a TV show,

1069
00:58:25.971 --> 00:58:27.530
you're allowed to go in there and bump bitches.

1070
00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:30.330
<v 0>Give him the bell.
You know what I'm saying?
Well,
not only that,</v>

1071
00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.770
I showed up every night,
every night I was there every night

1072
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:37.430
<v 1>about this whole thing from you.
It was newsradio on Fridays.</v>

1073
00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:42.060
You got that 11 in the morning,
wardrobe,
stupidity,
laughter,
food,

1074
00:58:42.061 --> 00:58:43.320
and then at eight o'clock your shoot,

1075
00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:47.670
you'd be strolling in there and fucking 1130 bro.
I respect you for that.

1076
00:58:47.671 --> 00:58:52.320
Until this day that meant more than me and you didn't need it and it's $15 it's

1077
00:58:52.321 --> 00:58:53.370
not like you had 19 yeah,

1078
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:56.670
<v 0>kids,
you need the 15 fucking dollars.
I'll tell you the truth.</v>

1079
00:58:56.730 --> 00:59:00.300
Being passed as a paid regular at the comedy store meant more to me.

1080
00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:04.200
Getting on a TV show.
Me Too.
When I was on a TV show when I was on news radio,

1081
00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:07.200
one of the things I love about you coming to visit me,
I was like,
finally,

1082
00:59:07.201 --> 00:59:11.060
there's another motherfucker doesn't belong here.
Because I was,

1083
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.650
I was always wandering around like one day they're going to tell me to get the

1084
00:59:13.651 --> 00:59:17.790
fuck off TB,
but until now somehow or another I'm on TV.
So Joey would show up.

1085
00:59:17.791 --> 00:59:21.090
I'd be like,
come here man.
Hey,
come here.
Let me show you what this,

1086
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:25.760
this is where they keep the food,
wander around the set.

1087
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.340
Joey would show up at the set and Joey would be sitting.
They had an executives,

1088
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:32.120
a VIP suite and the VIP suite.

1089
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:37.100
They had shrimp cocktails and delicious hors d'oeuvres and they had it catered.

1090
00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:41.990
A dude who you know had like one of those Mumford and sons fucking facial hair

1091
00:59:41.991 --> 00:59:46.250
things with a beautiful tie,
a thin,
skinny tie.
He'd be like serving people shit.

1092
00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:50.030
And it would be all these NBC executives and Joey fucking Diaz with a leather

1093
00:59:50.031 --> 00:59:52.850
jacket,
which stroll in and and feast.

1094
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:56.810
He'd be sitting there with a fucking paper plate with like 15 shrimps on it all.

1095
00:59:56.811 --> 01:00:00.620
But God,
is that your friend?
Can I ask you,

1096
01:00:00.621 --> 01:00:03.920
some has ever been a week that you caught yourself after a couple of days and

1097
01:00:03.921 --> 01:00:07.700
you've gone,
fuck,
why am in such a bad mood?
You're like,

1098
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:12.620
I got to get on stage.
You will.
Definitely.
I do it all the time.

1099
01:00:12.621 --> 01:00:17.260
Guys.
Like I fucking go frantic.
Like for two nights I go,
I'm gonna stay in,

1100
01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:22.310
right.
I'm going to be George Carlin.
It needs to go up by fucking Thursday.

1101
01:00:22.311 --> 01:00:26.200
I'm salivating.
By Thursday morning I wake up with that fucker.

1102
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:29.990
And also I'm on the flappers website.
I wanted the ice house website.

1103
01:00:29.991 --> 01:00:32.860
I'm looking for a spot,
you know,
I don't call him no way.
I'm just looking,

1104
01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.440
you know?
Well,
it's a fucking,
it's definitely an addiction,

1105
01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.890
but definitely that's a positive addiction.
Yes,

1106
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:42.890
definitely in the more addicted you,
like right now I'm super addicted.
Sure.

1107
01:00:42.891 --> 01:00:45.620
You got big things going on,
but I was thinking August I,
yeah,

1108
01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:48.840
I got my special that I'm going to fit record in August with the tickets are

1109
01:00:48.841 --> 01:00:50.030
still,
haven't been on sale for it yet,

1110
01:00:50.031 --> 01:00:52.920
but it's going to be at the comedy works in Denver and a,

1111
01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:57.160
I'm doing it in the little club to downtown club.
That's ferocious.

1112
01:00:57.730 --> 01:01:00.800
It's like a den of thieves,
so geared up for this.

1113
01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.540
I can't fucking wait back to day one,

1114
01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.590
which I understand like you're writing again.

1115
01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:08.470
You're looking at little words now and that gets you fired up all over again and

1116
01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:10.450
that really does well.
I'm just right now,

1117
01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:14.400
I've never been more excited about up then.
Right now I'm so,
I'm so into it,

1118
01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:18.230
but all the other things that I do,
I love working for the UFC.
I love it.

1119
01:01:18.231 --> 01:01:21.890
I love doing podcasts,
but stand up right now is my mother fucker.
I just,

1120
01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:24.800
I'm just enjoying it so much.
I'm enjoying watching it.

1121
01:01:24.801 --> 01:01:29.090
I'm enjoying doing it and my joint writing it.
I'm excited about it.
It's fun.

1122
01:01:29.091 --> 01:01:32.060
It's a fun time,
you know,
and the Ice House man,

1123
01:01:32.061 --> 01:01:35.360
the Ice House has helped me a lot.
Having that place where we,

1124
01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.250
we perform there on a regular basis.

1125
01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.670
How has a cool staff and everybody's not in Bob,
the owner,

1126
01:01:40.671 --> 01:01:41.960
just being such a good guy.

1127
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:45.410
It's gets such a good vibe in these shows that we've been and we've got to show

1128
01:01:45.411 --> 01:01:48.890
their tonight these shows that we do there.
They're so fucking fun.

1129
01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.510
Tonight's Ian Edwards,
Brian Cowen,
Tony Hinchcliffe,
Sam Tripoli,
me,

1130
01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:57.590
we're going to murder that thing that places a special,

1131
01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.950
like a magnet for fun.
There's a lot of fun times.
Fuck yeah,
it's,

1132
01:02:02.951 --> 01:02:07.430
it's,
at times it's everything that the comedy store used to be,
but positive.

1133
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:12.170
There's no negativity there.
There's no darkness that like hovers over the place.

1134
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:15.320
It's not the same.
But we're at different times in our life.

1135
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:19.590
And what was good about the comedy store when I was 25 is not good about the

1136
01:02:19.591 --> 01:02:23.370
comedy store now,
you know,
I don't,
I don't want that nonsense in my life anymore.

1137
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:27.510
But what's good about the ice house is like all the good things,

1138
01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:29.820
like an old comedy club with like a lot of history,

1139
01:02:29.821 --> 01:02:33.760
but none of the pretentiousness.
None of that bullshit.
Not Stuck on sunset.

1140
01:02:33.761 --> 01:02:37.290
So Dick wads come over from the sky bar,
all that,
you know,
all the,
the,

1141
01:02:37.291 --> 01:02:39.660
the element that you get in Hollywood,

1142
01:02:39.661 --> 01:02:43.740
that extra Dick Wad fucking actor element.

1143
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:47.310
You don't get that in Pasadena.
Pasadena is just all positive.

1144
01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:48.910
<v 1>I would tell you something,
man.
I uh,</v>

1145
01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:53.110
I'm doing the ice house next weekend with Dabo forever,
you know,

1146
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:54.980
and I just called them,
this is the truth guys.

1147
01:02:54.981 --> 01:02:59.981
I was talking to her dad on the phone and I had the computer open and something

1148
01:03:00.441 --> 01:03:03.500
like,
well,
let me see if he's got like a recent set to see what he's doing.

1149
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.930
You know,
dot Marrero always writing and dog.

1150
01:03:05.931 --> 01:03:09.380
I put the set on from Rodney and I gotta be honest here.

1151
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:12.500
I had tears going down my eyes.
I'm so proud of myself.

1152
01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:14.690
It was so like,

1153
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:20.230
I remember watching that fucking special and just getting anxiety from going.

1154
01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:25.250
Jesus,
I'll never be that fucking good.
Like my God,
not as a comic,

1155
01:03:25.251 --> 01:03:26.990
but he was a human being.
Like,

1156
01:03:26.991 --> 01:03:31.991
here I am in a halfway house watching this fucking tape of ham and Bill Hicks

1157
01:03:34.161 --> 01:03:37.340
and dice and God knows who else is on that.
Lenny Clark,

1158
01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:40.790
you know I love Lindy Clark from the beginning,
Bro.
Austin.
I'm like,

1159
01:03:40.791 --> 01:03:43.850
I'll never be as good to be here I am next weekend.

1160
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:47.190
I'm at the fucking ice house with them.
Herrera Co headline,

1161
01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.180
are you fucking kidding me?
I mean,
I you fucking serious.

1162
01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:51.950
That means more than any movie,

1163
01:03:51.951 --> 01:03:55.130
because I remember that dream a couple of weeks ago.
I'm an Austin,

1164
01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:59.000
Texas at the bar having a salad and who comes up and gives me a hug?

1165
01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:01.400
Joe Torry.
Listen,
man.

1166
01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:06.620
Joe Torry used to have a routine of def jam where he used to talk about,
yeah,

1167
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:10.280
I got a brother that's one of them saved.
Well,
motherfuckers,
not me.

1168
01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:14.390
I love mother.
Fuck,
I just bought a gun.
I can't wait to use it.
In fact,

1169
01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:17.300
I go to the ATM every night with a Tuxedo on his shit.

1170
01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:23.990
You know how many times I fucking watched that stupidity,
that fucking,

1171
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:29.630
uh,
all stars and dom are errors.
I sat there for hours going,

1172
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:34.310
what a shame that on.
I'll never be in that.

1173
01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:38.000
Not In this lifetime.
I have to come back as a decent human being and

1174
01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:42.620
get my shit be reborn as a decent human being.
Fucking,

1175
01:04:42.621 --> 01:04:47.210
you're a very decent human being.
Not at that time when I'd be watching that,

1176
01:04:47.211 --> 01:04:50.900
should I go,
okay,
so maybe if I do this for 20 years,

1177
01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.340
it might be a little funny,

1178
01:04:52.341 --> 01:04:55.610
but I'll never be as Joe Torry and every time I see to try to tell him the same

1179
01:04:55.611 --> 01:04:56.180
thing,

1180
01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:00.080
I'm going to get more fucking Tuxedo and I'm going go dial ATM at midnight and

1181
01:05:00.081 --> 01:05:04.790
Shit.
You know?
It's just very weird the times what's going on right now.

1182
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.250
Yeah.
You see people,
it's awesome.
It's awesome.

1183
01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.700
It's awesome to see the culmination of years and years and work for me.

1184
01:05:10.701 --> 01:05:14.120
It's beautiful because I got to see you really early on.
I mean,
I got to see you.

1185
01:05:14.121 --> 01:05:16.040
You don't want me doing comedy like a couple of years.

1186
01:05:16.041 --> 01:05:18.040
When I first met six is it was a mess.

1187
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.910
It was you wrote six years in when I met you.
Yeah.
That's probably,

1188
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:24.190
I started in 91 92 but when you came to the comedy store,

1189
01:05:24.191 --> 01:05:28.210
that's when he got real serious.
Right.
Mitzi shore touches you.

1190
01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:33.640
You got told you.
You had started in,
you did Denver and South Seattle.

1191
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:35.810
Those are the two spots.
Seattle was where I,

1192
01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:40.270
the lights got turned it on and Denver,
I was just going up.

1193
01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.380
It's like Jujitsu.

1194
01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:44.850
I just go there fucking around and if he lets me grab his call,

1195
01:05:44.851 --> 01:05:48.470
I grabbed his collar.
If he takes me down,
so be it.
If I get them down,
wow.

1196
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:51.720
Oh my God,
well now what do I do?
You know what I'm saying?
Right.

1197
01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:56.140
That's what comedy was for me in Denver,
but then I started doing time.

1198
01:05:56.141 --> 01:06:00.610
I started doing wait 24 minutes and then this opportunity came up in Seattle,

1199
01:06:00.611 --> 01:06:04.840
so I went to Seattle and Seattle was where there was an open mic.

1200
01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:08.560
It was 18 comics on an open mic.
On Mondays and Tuesdays.

1201
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.430
There was another open mic after that open like I another open Mike.

1202
01:06:12.431 --> 01:06:16.320
After that opened my and Tuesday there was another open mind and these are all

1203
01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:18.990
piece in places in Denver.
I had the calmer,

1204
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.460
you know head to had a guy in the head with a microphone and Denver one time

1205
01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:25.120
cause he was flicking bottle caps at the comics.
They test drove.

1206
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:27.580
If I still see Dave test drove today,
he'll go,

1207
01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:31.460
what's happening killer because I fucking hit this guy in the head with a

1208
01:06:31.461 --> 01:06:34.440
microphone.
Batteries what?
Everywhere you don't meet God.

1209
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:36.700
I told them if you flick one fucking thing up here,

1210
01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:38.620
I'm a break this microphone over your fucking head.

1211
01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:41.560
What did he do with his buddy?
Click burn.

1212
01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:46.360
They gave me 25 bucks gift certificate and I had to get the fuck out of it and I

1213
01:06:46.361 --> 01:06:49.600
took my steak to go.
I'm going to forget that.
And Denver you had,

1214
01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:53.770
you had no comedy on Mondays I had the Australian Barton Boulder,

1215
01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:55.960
which does not exist there anymore.

1216
01:06:56.350 --> 01:07:00.250
On Tuesdays I had Wendy ten three minutes.

1217
01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.550
You got twice a month,
three minutes at the comedy works in those days.

1218
01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:06.070
Wednesdays you at club 52,

1219
01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:09.160
Thursdays you had El Torito and uh,

1220
01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:13.540
by John Elway up there by John Elway's and Englewood,

1221
01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:18.790
Colorado where all Cherry hill all the way up.
Dad El Torito.

1222
01:07:18.791 --> 01:07:22.600
As soon as you got off the ice 70,
and on Friday and Saturday,
you an open Mike.

1223
01:07:22.601 --> 01:07:23.434
You had dick,

1224
01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:26.620
you know how many fucking places I hadn't Seattle on a Friday night.

1225
01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.890
You know how many places you had on a Wednesday night?
You got to coma,

1226
01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.970
you had Seattle,
you had Everett,
you had Bellingham on Sundays.

1227
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.350
More comics.

1228
01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:42.970
When I think Seattle,
Seattle,
you know,
just the core I had was me,
Brody,

1229
01:07:42.971 --> 01:07:47.220
Josh Wolfe,
I,
you should tailor went through there,
you know,
I know.

1230
01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.670
Well they wouldn't San Francisco.

1231
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:52.140
So I knew a lot of those people at the festivals and at the,

1232
01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:56.500
the comedy competition and then the hand,
you know,
Steve McGrew,

1233
01:07:56.501 --> 01:08:00.610
Todd Jordan had some hitters too,
but the open mic scene wasn't that strong.

1234
01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:04.360
It was very in Denver.
Seattle did that.
But there was one guy,

1235
01:08:04.361 --> 01:08:07.900
his name was Andy Peyton.
He was a fucking dead tremendous guy.

1236
01:08:07.901 --> 01:08:10.960
He's a mayor of a town.
He ran for politics.
He was a genius.

1237
01:08:10.961 --> 01:08:14.110
He went to all these bars and he got a night in each bar.

1238
01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.070
They paid them a little bit.
Every night you

1239
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:19.550
<v 4>got a little bit 20 bucks,
10 bucks,
30 bucks,</v>

1240
01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.230
but at least you got to go on stage.

1241
01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:26.260
Andy paid and also sold advertising and pulled out a newspaper,
I think.
Aye.

1242
01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:31.490
Aye.
I give a lot of credit to my career,
to Andy,
to you and to Mitzi shore,

1243
01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.960
but Andy painted believes in me the way Dick Dardy believed in you because he

1244
01:08:35.961 --> 01:08:37.490
didn't give a fuck that I was dirty.

1245
01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:41.390
But that mother fucker roommate Brian Sundays,
he goes,
I'll give you 50 bucks.

1246
01:08:41.770 --> 01:08:45.800
You've got to follow a line dancing class and Colorado Jack,
Achy,

1247
01:08:45.801 --> 01:08:50.000
breaky heart bitch,
and I'd be the first comic up at the Achy breaky heart.

1248
01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:53.210
You want to talk about hate?
You want to talk about no laughter.

1249
01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:58.180
He give me 50 bucks on Sunday and in those days,
on Sundays at seven,

1250
01:08:58.190 --> 01:09:01.220
I used to drop my daughter off and as soon as I slammed the door,

1251
01:09:01.221 --> 01:09:05.120
I just go into tears and I'd get on the seventh day and I'd smoke a joint and by

1252
01:09:05.121 --> 01:09:09.470
the time I get to the Gig I'd be brand fucking new and I'd go on that stage just

1253
01:09:09.471 --> 01:09:11.360
to die.
It was like a day are dying.

1254
01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.770
It was like five hours of my daughter and I took their abuse and then I had,

1255
01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.710
I would go to this bar and fucking Arvada.

1256
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:21.460
You've never even been taught about it.
Oh,

1257
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:24.860
you see the signs where Duane Ludwig is from Arvada

1258
01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.590
and I'd have to do this fucking country barn on Sunday night.

1259
01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.070
Andy page them was a genius Bro.
He had two of those weeks.

1260
01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:35.510
So he would call you and go,

1261
01:09:35.511 --> 01:09:39.230
you got the whole week and I'm talking to Monday through Sunday,

1262
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:42.440
40 30 they weren't two hour drive,

1263
01:09:42.441 --> 01:09:46.010
so it would just dumped bars and way before the stadium went up.

1264
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:51.470
This is what,
that shit was a shit hole down there really.
And the comedy works.

1265
01:09:51.471 --> 01:09:54.100
Told him you're not allowed in here because you got all you can get girl

1266
01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.700
competition.
So he said,
really I'm a while,

1267
01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.340
I'm going to teach you motherfuckers a lesson.

1268
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:02.030
He spanked him for about a year and a half though.
But then he moved,

1269
01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:06.650
he went to like one of those small towns and he uh,
became the mayor.

1270
01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.380
It became a mayor.
Man.

1271
01:10:08.381 --> 01:10:11.810
I know he's on Facebook and I think I went back and forth with them at one time.

1272
01:10:11.811 --> 01:10:14.300
I thanked them and that's what he says.

1273
01:10:14.301 --> 01:10:18.680
He's still does come here once a month in this town.
He went to like a town.

1274
01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:22.310
Imagine the mayor's doing stand up in your town and that's what maybe a mayor

1275
01:10:22.311 --> 01:10:25.730
for a long time.
There's a term limits.
I'm being a man.
Nah,

1276
01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:30.470
cause the man from North Bergen may have saccos been there fucking at least

1277
01:10:30.471 --> 01:10:32.270
fucking 10 years.
12 years.

1278
01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:36.453
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1279
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:39.760
<v 4>You can't,
there's no term limits on Supreme Court justices.
Right.</v>

1280
01:10:39.761 --> 01:10:42.550
And not like something that people don't like it.

1281
01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:46.150
It's different in places in Ohio and Cincinnati.

1282
01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:48.130
The term limit is two successive.

1283
01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:51.160
A four year terms is different in different places apparently.

1284
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.823
<v 5>Huh?</v>

1285
01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:59.740
<v 4>That's gotta be a thankless fucking job being the mayor of a town,</v>

1286
01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:02.860
trying to keep everybody in order.
There's crime in this town,
mayor.

1287
01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.220
We want me to do the fuck are we going to do?

1288
01:11:06.221 --> 01:11:08.800
I'm going to stop the crime and stop people from stealing shit.

1289
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.400
Do it the bad that it might.
Tyler.
Josie put cameras up around the city.

1290
01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:14.050
That's communism.

1291
01:11:14.090 --> 01:11:17.700
Why fucking come from Doug [inaudible] and the city on the street?

1292
01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.970
We know Camden.
You know Campbell in that police officer's anymore.

1293
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:24.360
Camden is so broke.
There's just ramping crime police officers.

1294
01:11:24.361 --> 01:11:27.750
So you know what they did?
They just put cameras up everywhere,
everywhere.

1295
01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:30.570
Some Robo cop shit.
They're like living in the future.

1296
01:11:30.571 --> 01:11:32.130
I got a secret for you motherfuckers.

1297
01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:37.700
I knew Camden was the real deal in 1978 I couldn't believe what I had.

1298
01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:41.070
So,
and what'd you say?
I saw anarchy.

1299
01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:47.430
I've been robbed one time on the street and a drug deal.
One time in my life.

1300
01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.490
Did I get drunk,
robbed on the street and the drug dealer was in Camden,

1301
01:11:50.491 --> 01:11:51.324
New Jersey.

1302
01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:57.180
They don't fuck around and then can then bro Penn saucon can then that's a

1303
01:11:57.181 --> 01:12:00.480
complete different world.
I got robbed for a pound of coke.
I pound the weed.

1304
01:12:00.481 --> 01:12:03.270
I had to go answer the people that gave me money,
investors.

1305
01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:07.830
I had to go pay these people back and sell weed and I had to do what I had to
do.

1306
01:12:07.831 --> 01:12:11.070
I fucked up,
but they robbed me,
man.
They sent me to fuck up.

1307
01:12:11.190 --> 01:12:16.190
Camden is the poorest city in the country and it has the highest rate of murder

1308
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:20.220
in the country.
No Shit.
They got no cop on the street.
It's an animal.

1309
01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.770
Canon Mother fucking New Jersey,
New Jersey.

1310
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.820
We played them one year in basketball and Dennis still,
I'll never forget,

1311
01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:31.200
there's a coach in our high school that was in a wheelchair.
He got paralyzed.

1312
01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:35.730
Dennis still went up to him to spit in his fucking face dog in high school.

1313
01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:40.110
When you spit in the handicap dude's face,
Jesus,
you ain't fucking around.

1314
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:42.600
You want to hear a crazy crime statistic.
Camden,

1315
01:12:42.601 --> 01:12:47.601
New Jersey and has the crime rate of 78% per 1000 residents.

1316
01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:52.530
So for every 1000 residents,
78% of them are going to experience crime.

1317
01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:58.710
78%.
That's like,
how much crime do you experience in Burbank?

1318
01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:03.510
0% did you get 78 he got robbed by Dracula.
This fucking guy,

1319
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:06.640
he was probably really loud and

1320
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:11.670
bought a pistol.
Blackwoods or the plaque was,

1321
01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:17.220
I know Camden.
I had never seen anything like that.
Then I had a buddy,

1322
01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:21.500
a basketball player buddy.
I was putting pen soccer and I went down to the visit,

1323
01:13:21.501 --> 01:13:25.800
his family once and I left there with my fucking jaw dropped and I knew not to

1324
01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:30.030
go back down there.
I read all these Kansas statistics now and I'm like,
no shit.

1325
01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:33.060
That place was the edge of health dirty fucking years ago.

1326
01:13:33.061 --> 01:13:37.110
I can't imagine what it is now.
Yeah.
Matt Taibbi wrote an article about it.

1327
01:13:37.111 --> 01:13:39.960
I'm tweeting it right now.
He wrote an article about,
uh,

1328
01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:43.110
Camden saying it's called Apocalypse New Jersey.
Uh,

1329
01:13:43.111 --> 01:13:46.140
dispatch from America's most desperate town.
No jobs,

1330
01:13:46.141 --> 01:13:49.890
no hope and surveillance cameras everywhere.
The strange,

1331
01:13:49.891 --> 01:13:54.480
sad story of Camden.
That's the population.
That's a good question.

1332
01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.370
What if it's like 14 people?

1333
01:13:56.371 --> 01:13:59.580
You know there's a lot of fucking people that surrounds Camden brother.

1334
01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:03.180
Take a look for you,
uncle Joe.
Shit around New Jersey,

1335
01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:06.790
near Atlantic city.
Right,
right,
right,
right.
It's,

1336
01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:10.680
I thought it was near Philadelphia too,
probably.
Yeah,

1337
01:14:10.681 --> 01:14:13.210
it's across the Delaware River from Philly.

1338
01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:15.730
There's a 77,000 people.

1339
01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:21.310
If you don't want to get fucked up,
don't go to camp and Jack,
don't buy weed.

1340
01:14:21.311 --> 01:14:23.680
Don't do nothing.
I got tricked.

1341
01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:28.960
They used to be this gas station,
not Bergen went on from called Putnam,

1342
01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:30.850
and when I became,
after my mom died,

1343
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:34.660
I had an inside guy and I robbed them once a month,
like a fake robbery.

1344
01:14:34.661 --> 01:14:36.040
You know what I'm saying?
We'd go hit up in the head,

1345
01:14:36.041 --> 01:14:38.860
he'd go down and we'd take a thousand and all he wanted was an eight ball.

1346
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:42.940
He was a little half on the Patato sake robbery,
all tremendous.

1347
01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:44.680
I worked at Putnam fuel.

1348
01:14:44.681 --> 01:14:48.190
Everybody from that high school work that Putin and fuel and you robbed them to

1349
01:14:48.191 --> 01:14:52.140
death until they find you.
Ernie was always a shift manager and he had kids.

1350
01:14:52.141 --> 01:14:55.180
He was going to fucked up melting.
I love cocaine,
man.

1351
01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:59.520
Me and my wife love with his wife was like 400 pounds.
She didn't work.
You know,

1352
01:14:59.530 --> 01:15:02.380
he had to bring the home fucking almond joys,
that type of shit.

1353
01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:05.380
He worked at a gas station.
They live in a terrible apartment,

1354
01:15:05.381 --> 01:15:09.250
but they were cocaine heads and I was 16 and I had worked and he's telling me I

1355
01:15:09.251 --> 01:15:13.210
need eight ball and I go,
honey,
how can we do just,
how can we make this happen?

1356
01:15:14.170 --> 01:15:17.980
And one day he's like,
you can fake rob me.
Alright rob.

1357
01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:22.750
He's like one dog.
You know how many times I fake rob dirty?
I'm about six times.

1358
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:23.750
In fact,

1359
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:26.710
there's a kid in Florida has a story that I showed up at his house one night

1360
01:15:26.711 --> 01:15:28.150
with a,
with a diagram,

1361
01:15:28.151 --> 01:15:31.170
cause you had a Robin in the same way you had to go around the building.

1362
01:15:31.171 --> 01:15:34.000
It was cameras in the front in those days you got to go around the back,

1363
01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:36.400
ring the bell.
When he come out,
he had to attack.

1364
01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.040
I couldn't be the same guy all the time.
That rob them,

1365
01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:41.800
but you were going to be fine.
You weren't going to get arrested.

1366
01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.970
Just take the walk and me,
trust me,
and he always took.

1367
01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:46.660
Now whenever he goes to the comedy show goes,
he goes,

1368
01:15:46.661 --> 01:15:48.670
I'm in the cocoa coming home.
When they were the diagram,

1369
01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:50.320
I were going to rob a gas station,

1370
01:15:50.321 --> 01:15:52.480
like a football player because it was brilliant.

1371
01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:57.460
I Rob Ernie once a fucking every six weeks.
The cotton where you had to hit him,

1372
01:15:58.030 --> 01:16:01.270
you got to kick him in the stomach and shit and like smack him so he would bleed

1373
01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:04.960
and the cops,
he would say,
Ernie,
nobody gets robbed like this one.

1374
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:07.840
What do you want me to tell you?
They know I'm a fucking idiot,
bro.

1375
01:16:07.841 --> 01:16:10.990
We would rob them once every six weeks and finally it ended.

1376
01:16:10.991 --> 01:16:15.480
I didn't bring him the eight ball
when that I just did as a boy.

1377
01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:19.090
He got pissed off at me and that was it.
Being around shady people like that,

1378
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:21.130
I'd grown up.
Brunch 80 people gives you such a,

1379
01:16:21.330 --> 01:16:23.720
a different flavor to life just is.

1380
01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:27.010
There's an extra element when you look at the time,

1381
01:16:27.011 --> 01:16:29.560
it's probably a little dangerous when you look back on it and laugh.

1382
01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:32.680
There's so many w work at this gas station.

1383
01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:35.570
I worked at a gas station for a little while and it was this old guy who used to

1384
01:16:35.571 --> 01:16:36.341
come in the gas station.

1385
01:16:36.341 --> 01:16:39.430
This old dude who had like one of those classic bald guys.

1386
01:16:39.431 --> 01:16:42.070
He was balled up top of the hair on the side,
looked like,
you know,

1387
01:16:42.071 --> 01:16:45.430
you see a guy like that.
You think he's like a normal guy?
Probably an off,
no.

1388
01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:49.420
This guy used to drive the souped up Buick and he was a total pervert and all he

1389
01:16:49.421 --> 01:16:52.570
could do was talk about pussy.
This old man talking about pussy,

1390
01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.340
like gray hair on the sides of his head,

1391
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:57.820
just talking about finger and chicks and fucking shit like he was a madman.

1392
01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:02.200
But being around that guy made me realize that like I see a dude like an old

1393
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:05.170
dude who's bald with the fucking hair on the side.
And I say,

1394
01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.330
well this is probably a nice gentlemen.
Like,
no,

1395
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:10.070
it's the old pervert driving a hot rod Buick finger and chicks.

1396
01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.710
<v 0>She realize you're around people like that.
You know that there's something else.</v>

1397
01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.300
Like there's possibilities.
There's,

1398
01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:21.260
there's a lot of different kinds of people in life and sometimes just because

1399
01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:25.340
someone looks like someone that you've sort of already met before,
like,
Oh yeah,

1400
01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:28.610
I know that type.
No you don't.
You have no idea.
Look at Ted Bundy.

1401
01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:32.480
That was how Ted Bundy got all those girls.
He looked like a normal handsome guy.

1402
01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:35.510
He didn't look like some Ed gain fucking psychopath with

1403
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:40.140
<v 1>creepy little beady eyes.
Weird strange man was strained,</v>

1404
01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:44.080
yelled to eat when to catch you up and tying you into the lamp.
No,

1405
01:17:44.081 --> 01:17:47.910
he looked like a guy that you'd want to date a Mark Harmon play them.
Yeah.

1406
01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:50.350
That was a goal when he escaped from the jail.
It fucking,

1407
01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:53.400
that has been through a window for a while.
I thought I was crazy though.

1408
01:17:53.401 --> 01:17:57.750
Cause I lived everywhere with Ted Bundy lived for a while.
I thought I was crazy.

1409
01:17:57.870 --> 01:18:00.660
I lived in Snowmass village.
He killed the check.

1410
01:18:00.661 --> 01:18:04.140
He kidnapped her from the Willow Brook Hotel,
whatever,
in Snowmass village.

1411
01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:07.980
And then we looked to Seattle.
That's where he did most of his damage.

1412
01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:10.770
That was Seattle.
He did.
Didn't he do some in Florida?

1413
01:18:10.771 --> 01:18:13.470
Florida was at the end of the dormitory.
Oh,
that was the end.

1414
01:18:13.530 --> 01:18:16.320
I think looking up something for a long time.
I'm like,

1415
01:18:16.321 --> 01:18:19.980
maybe I'm fucking crazy dog.
I keep living everywhere and I mean,
I'm not mean.

1416
01:18:19.981 --> 01:18:24.150
I mean,
and and snowmen.
I mean,
yeah,
he escaped from the,
asked me to fucking jail.

1417
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.420
<v 0>Ted Bondi.
That was a,
that was a scary one.
That guy used to,</v>

1418
01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:31.570
he used to pick up girls and take them for rides in his car and they realized

1419
01:18:31.571 --> 01:18:33.670
there was no door knob on their side.

1420
01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.920
They would go to reach for like the door to open it.

1421
01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:37.420
There's no door knob he would remove.

1422
01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:39.940
He had the door knobs were removed and the side of his car,

1423
01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:45.160
2002 film Ted Bundy be looking at him.
He's a handsome guy.

1424
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.730
Normal looking dude.
Is he still alive?

1425
01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:53.570
<v 1>They launched that kill him.
Yeah,
he was in Aspen.
Remember they launched them.</v>

1426
01:18:53.571 --> 01:18:57.470
And,
uh,
they celebrated his death and all the towns we killed people.

1427
01:18:57.471 --> 01:19:00.110
They had happy hours that drinks the Bundy and shit.

1428
01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:03.740
<v 0>Yeah.
January 24th,
1989,
they killed him.</v>

1429
01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.430
He was age 42 at the Florida state.
Yeah.

1430
01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:10.350
<v 1>Does he represent himself?
He was an attorney by letting them know by,</v>

1431
01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:13.720
I think he was,
he,
he was,
he didn't take the test to something.

1432
01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:18.400
He did a lot of crazy shit,
man.
Fuck yeah.
He killed a lot of girls,
man.

1433
01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:19.653
He revisited

1434
01:19:19.670 --> 01:19:21.740
<v 0>secondary crime scenes for hours at a time.</v>

1435
01:19:21.741 --> 01:19:25.600
Grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpse is until future

1436
01:19:25.601 --> 01:19:30.230
vacation and destruction by wild animals made further interaction.
Impossible.

1437
01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.980
He decapitated at least 12 of his victims and kept some of the severed heads in

1438
01:19:33.981 --> 01:19:38.660
his apartment for a period of time as momentos on a few occasions,

1439
01:19:38.661 --> 01:19:43.100
he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeons his victims as they slept.

1440
01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:46.600
Man,
he was their first kidnapped.

1441
01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:51.530
They first got him in 1975 for aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal

1442
01:19:51.531 --> 01:19:52.364
assault.

1443
01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:57.110
And then he became a suspect and it progressively longer list of unsolved

1444
01:19:57.111 --> 01:20:01.850
homicides and multiple states.
Fuck,
call it Colorado and Florida.

1445
01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:03.830
Ah,
God.
Damn.

1446
01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:08.070
<v 1>Florida finally launched him,
correct?
Yup.
The dormitory.</v>

1447
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:11.460
<v 0>That's where he got the girls at the University of Florida,
right?
Gainesville,</v>

1448
01:20:11.461 --> 01:20:13.860
wasn't it in Gainesville or something like that?
Yeah,
there's some,

1449
01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.910
there's a lot of those fucking guys out there,
man.
It's like what?

1450
01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:22.110
What turns a guy like Ted Bundy and to someone who would do that shit.

1451
01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:25.980
Damn.
Have you seen his morgue picks?
Morgan pig?

1452
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:28.660
<v 6>Yeah.
When they ain't got executed,
I guess.
Yeah.
Picks of it.</v>

1453
01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:31.830
It's like there's a color one.
There's a black and white one.

1454
01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:37.130
<v 0>Uh,
a prom with more pixus.
Who the fuck knows if that's real?
Yeah,</v>

1455
01:20:37.670 --> 01:20:38.503
yeah.
Yes.

1456
01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:41.053
<v 5>Yeah.
It didn't look good.</v>

1457
01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:45.870
<v 0>Shaved his head too.
Yeah.
Top of his head.
It looks like it blew up or something.</v>

1458
01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:49.950
And that's what they do when they're cooking you.
Yeah.
Scary shit man.

1459
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:54.710
It's just scary shit that someone could be like that.
Yeah.

1460
01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:58.380
Motherfucker killed catch when he was six.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1461
01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:03.170
Killed dogs is shit tortured Michael Victim.
It's shit.
The fucking,
yeah.

1462
01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:06.150
There's though he's bludgeoning women in their fucking sleep and rape and

1463
01:21:06.151 --> 01:21:10.320
corporates is what the fuck happens to people,
Bro.
Yeah.
That is the question.

1464
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:11.580
The fuck happens to people.

1465
01:21:11.581 --> 01:21:15.900
What is it about people that a switch can go off and then boom,

1466
01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:21.180
all of a sudden you're Dylan Klebold and Colorado shooting up your school.

1467
01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:25.770
What is it,
what,
what combination of chemicals and behavior in life,

1468
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:30.210
what combinations of curve balls and shitty genetics and all sorts of different

1469
01:21:30.211 --> 01:21:31.770
things cause someone to be that way?

1470
01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:36.170
<v 6>His,
uh,
his beetle was on display in a museum recently.</v>

1471
01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:41.570
They found,
uh,
in it they found a bunch of items that were in it.

1472
01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:44.430
And one was a crow bar,
Eh,
uh,

1473
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:48.980
garage garbage bags and ice pick,
a flashlight,
torn strips of sheeting,

1474
01:21:48.981 --> 01:21:52.670
a nit ski mask,
handcuffs,
and a strange mask made from panty hose.

1475
01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:59.860
<v 0>What the fuck?
And in Florida living in Florida wasn't bad enough.</v>

1476
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:02.470
You got to deal with that guy riding around.

1477
01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:08.020
Imagine if ted money was alive today.
How big 90% of Nancy Grace's show

1478
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:13.280
Ted Bundy and full Laura.
Uh,

1479
01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.830
Florida's a wild fucking places you stand up to.

1480
01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:19.730
It was one of the wildest spots I was thinking that the other day like that,

1481
01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:23.420
that Hollywood Improv,
the Improv in Fort Lauderdale,
Hollywood,
Florida,

1482
01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:27.530
Dad fucking Improv is one of the wildest clubs in the goddamn country as Brian

1483
01:22:27.531 --> 01:22:31.070
counts favorite place to perform.
He's like,
they're off the chain there.

1484
01:22:31.450 --> 01:22:35.360
Their animals.
It was just a mosaic where you,
what'd you do?

1485
01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:38.720
What'd you do it with?
But did you bring anybody with you or you don't know?

1486
01:22:38.721 --> 01:22:39.411
They will like,
no,

1487
01:22:39.411 --> 01:22:43.550
you have to pay like $800 for a hotel for the Brigham features the casino

1488
01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:46.460
because they put you in the casino.
They don't give you a second hotel room.

1489
01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:49.450
You get to make them give you a second.
It was like they have a hotel room.
I,

1490
01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:52.970
you know,
I thought it was in a casino is going to be boring.
It wasn't that bad.

1491
01:22:52.971 --> 01:22:56.060
It was pretty good.
As a matter of fact,
I had a good time.
Yeah,
it's a fun,

1492
01:22:56.061 --> 01:22:58.780
great time.
I really didn't have a good time.
If you live in around there,

1493
01:22:58.790 --> 01:23:01.490
that hard rock.
So decent passive.
No.
Yeah,
no,
no,
it was great.

1494
01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.200
It sounds like those places where they do,

1495
01:23:03.201 --> 01:23:06.090
they used to do king of the cage in the of the band days.

1496
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.390
Did you ever go to the one of those with me?
No.

1497
01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:11.950
Eddie Bravo and I went to a bunch of them and he used to work for the king,

1498
01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:15.070
the cage.
He was the posts,
the commentator.

1499
01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:19.870
So we would travel sometimes to these,
these gigs were in the middle of fucking,

1500
01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:24.670
I mean know where these weird native American casinos where the only places

1501
01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:27.310
where he could do it because they had sovereignty over their own land.

1502
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:30.610
So even though MMA was banned in California at the time,

1503
01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:33.610
they could still put on fights these casinos and that's when people started to

1504
01:23:33.611 --> 01:23:36.060
wake up because he's like,
what?
Why are we making this illegal?

1505
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:37.690
You don't much fucking money these people are making,

1506
01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.460
because you would go to the middle of nowhere.

1507
01:23:39.490 --> 01:23:44.170
I mean hours and hours drive and there would be thousands of people there for an

1508
01:23:44.171 --> 01:23:49.120
event.
All people.
We knew people we knew from Jujitsu guys.
We trained with guys.

1509
01:23:49.121 --> 01:23:52.780
We knew that we're like tap the tap out guys and the early days and we would go

1510
01:23:52.781 --> 01:23:56.290
there and they'd have these outdoor arenas like these outdoors,

1511
01:23:56.950 --> 01:24:00.790
like seated state.
Most of the time,
no cover over it.
If it rained,

1512
01:24:00.791 --> 01:24:01.720
the fights kept going.

1513
01:24:02.290 --> 01:24:05.590
They made a whole DVD called wet and wild where they let it rain.

1514
01:24:05.591 --> 01:24:10.540
It was fucking pouring out and the middle of these crazy torrential downpours

1515
01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:14.940
dudes were fighting.
It's not a bad idea.
It's the dumbest idea of all time,

1516
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.210
but yet no traction at all.
You would throw upon,

1517
01:24:20.211 --> 01:24:24.070
she would fucking go fly in because they had one of those old school vinyl

1518
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:27.790
floors.
If it was a canvas floor,
it would still be slippery,

1519
01:24:28.090 --> 01:24:31.240
but it would be less slippery.
But this shit wasn't canvas.

1520
01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:34.690
This shit was like like vinyl,
so it was like a swimming pool.

1521
01:24:34.691 --> 01:24:35.860
It's like slip and slide.

1522
01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:39.460
It really was like trying to have a kickboxing match on slip and slide.

1523
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:42.940
Dudes fallen s little knees get blown out,

1524
01:24:43.090 --> 01:24:47.230
fall on top of each other like it was like one of the sloppiest Emma May cards

1525
01:24:47.231 --> 01:24:50.620
ever,
but kind of fun because it's a piece of history.

1526
01:24:50.621 --> 01:24:53.560
I don't think they should ever do it again,
but it's good that it exists.

1527
01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.650
I think this is probably a,
probably a pull down from youtube.

1528
01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:04.300
We put a video on our [inaudible].

1529
01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.960
<v 1>That's funny.
If you ever go to boulder again,</v>

1530
01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:11.590
they'll make sure you go to the rope institute.
NEROPA institute.
What does,

1531
01:25:11.591 --> 01:25:15.940
that's a cool mother.
I,
what is this?
That place?
It's a Buddhist college.

1532
01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:20.620
Really?
I went down on Monday.
I used to go to when I was fucked up in the head,

1533
01:25:20.621 --> 01:25:23.980
right.
I thought I didn't know what I want to do with my life.

1534
01:25:23.981 --> 01:25:25.630
I was confused after prison.

1535
01:25:25.631 --> 01:25:28.000
I didn't know when I would go there on Mondays I'm walking,
meditate.

1536
01:25:28.001 --> 01:25:30.910
I learned how to meditate there.
I went to a seminar,

1537
01:25:30.911 --> 01:25:34.660
she didn't Halloween Ginsburg there and you know it's all vegetarians.

1538
01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:37.510
Fuck though.
Like I went to a massage therapist and that was tremendous.

1539
01:25:37.511 --> 01:25:40.750
The only time I ever allowed myself,
she stunk so bad.

1540
01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:42.790
But the massages were so good,

1541
01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:45.970
but I could smell her fucking arm pits in the is something that I was fucking

1542
01:25:45.971 --> 01:25:49.840
hard,
but they were the nicest fucking people in the world.

1543
01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:54.100
And they always have a course that you'll look at it and go,
Huh,

1544
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:57.970
like class,
they're teaching.
Like,
you know what man,
I was young,

1545
01:25:57.971 --> 01:26:02.350
I was maybe 30 I didn't know right before Cami,
I was frustrated.
I was married,

1546
01:26:02.351 --> 01:26:07.190
I didn't know.
And I go there.
I remember taking like a humanitarian course,

1547
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:08.443
you know?

1548
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:13.450
But it was so I think that it would be more interesting to me because now I've

1549
01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:17.570
gained more knowledge.
I know what the fuck I am.
So if you ever go there again,

1550
01:26:17.571 --> 01:26:18.460
I never mentioned it to you.

1551
01:26:18.490 --> 01:26:22.520
My friend owns the cafeteria and it's a vegetarian cafeteria,

1552
01:26:22.521 --> 01:26:24.290
but every once in a while he's a Spanish dude.

1553
01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:28.260
He whips up some bad ass shit Levy.
Yeah,
man.
And He,

1554
01:26:28.261 --> 01:26:31.820
it was weird how he took over it.
And I always forget to tell you about the,

1555
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:35.630
I don't know if you ever go back to boulder,
but if you do check it out.

1556
01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:38.480
I even go on the web page.
Just look,

1557
01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:42.010
they always have some fucking genius gone through there.

1558
01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:46.310
Drop him bad ass knowledge.
Listen,
if you want to see the stones,

1559
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:49.550
you go to the garden.
If you want to see a good fight,
you got to God.

1560
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:53.570
If you want to see a smart,
keen,
bad ass motherfucker,
drop knowledge,

1561
01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:58.550
go to Naropa.
Really go to boulder.
Boulder's got some fucking,

1562
01:26:58.551 --> 01:27:00.470
you know we met,
look at Bro,

1563
01:27:00.471 --> 01:27:04.060
they have elite martial artists to have elite MMA guys and Bulger.

1564
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:05.810
They got a float tank business to have a float tank.

1565
01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:09.410
They have everything in bold.
I mean that's an astronaut school.

1566
01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:14.660
So there's people who have,
it's amazing the quality of people.

1567
01:27:14.661 --> 01:27:19.230
I met boulder that I judged that I was like blown away by now.

1568
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:21.160
It's a great town just because you,

1569
01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:24.470
because you know when you meet a physicist and he meets a guy like me,

1570
01:27:24.471 --> 01:27:27.830
he looks down on me in boulder.
Those motherfuckers talk to you.

1571
01:27:27.831 --> 01:27:31.100
And then they tell you about,
I've,
I've stabbed a motherfucker one time.

1572
01:27:31.101 --> 01:27:33.920
You know what?
You went to Yale,

1573
01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:38.630
you got to fucking masters from Harvard.
Yeah.
You know,
one time some guy,

1574
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:41.000
you know,
because that fucking so extreme.

1575
01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:46.230
Just because they're geniuses and that level doesn't mean that nerds,
Bro,
if,

1576
01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.760
especially if they moved,
the bulk of it might be hunters.

1577
01:27:50.210 --> 01:27:53.240
Like I know a guy that was a fucking brilliant dude,
but he was like a race.

1578
01:27:53.250 --> 01:27:57.570
You know,
he's a guy,
he's a racist.
He's like a KKK racist,
I believe,

1579
01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:01.220
because he was dad accentuate Joe.
You posted something the other day,

1580
01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:06.230
six geniuses who are perverts.
What does it,
Bro,
when you become that deep,

1581
01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:10.940
I would go to the rope and listen.
The GINSBURG is one of the guys.

1582
01:28:10.941 --> 01:28:15.890
I remember I probably went to four seminars there that to listen to people speak

1583
01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:18.530
and everybody had samples on it.
It was Vegan.

1584
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:23.840
But I grasp a lot of fucking different things.
Man,
that helped me,
you know,

1585
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:25.330
I remember going there one time and going,

1586
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:28.910
maybe the Catholic religion is bullshit the way this motherfucker was dropping

1587
01:28:28.911 --> 01:28:32.910
it right.
They weren't asking you to donate.
They weren't asking you to join.

1588
01:28:32.911 --> 01:28:36.230
They didn't want you to be Richard Gere.
I knew the Dalai Lama was going there.

1589
01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:40.350
Probably alum is always swinging in boulder or he used to some,

1590
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:45.290
somebody from that tribe goes to that Neropa no,
sure.
Every interesting bro.
Oh,

1591
01:28:45.291 --> 01:28:46.640
and I always forgot to ask you,

1592
01:28:46.641 --> 01:28:50.460
in your travels and anybody ever approach you and Sam or somebody from the

1593
01:28:50.461 --> 01:28:54.110
Europa?
No,
it's so,
it's a Buddhist university.
It's like,

1594
01:28:54.111 --> 01:28:58.010
look at how this college buddy spell it.
Uh,
and a ROP.

1595
01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:02.100
A very fucking cool and,
oh,

1596
01:29:02.930 --> 01:29:06.660
<v 0>I like the mind of a fucking thief and Roper University.</v>

1597
01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:07.940
And they would get through to them.

1598
01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:09.100
<v 1>Like,
I was like,
wow,</v>

1599
01:29:09.101 --> 01:29:14.101
these fucking people are cool as shit because when you make judgment,

1600
01:29:14.501 --> 01:29:15.400
you're like,
oh,
this just,

1601
01:29:15.401 --> 01:29:18.580
cause this guy went to og or whatever and he's not going to be interested in

1602
01:29:19.150 --> 01:29:23.290
smoking a joint.
Oh,
this mother fucker's got a pound their suitcase on.

1603
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:27.300
I'm the microscope.
You know,
like he grew with it.
Something you're like,
wow.

1604
01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:32.610
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
I went to a,
an Osram when I was in boulder.</v>

1605
01:29:33.010 --> 01:29:35.970
They were then an Osram and the mountains,
like a beauty shots.
Hey,

1606
01:29:35.971 --> 01:29:40.470
we just meditate up there in the mountains and kill bugs,

1607
01:29:40.710 --> 01:29:44.640
you know,
Buddhist and not supposed to kill bugs.
It's lady had a bug spray.
I go,

1608
01:29:44.641 --> 01:29:48.720
what are you doing?
And she goes like,
we have an ant problem.
I go,
wait a minute.

1609
01:29:48.930 --> 01:29:51.750
You know,
you're a Buddhist.
You're not supposed to be spraying fucking bugs.

1610
01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:53.370
Like that's like convenient.

1611
01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:57.510
It's very convenient of you that you spraying aunt medication or ant poison out

1612
01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:02.250
and not supposed to do that.
She said she has.
Yeah.
Well it's very unfortunate,

1613
01:30:02.251 --> 01:30:06.900
but we really have a uh,
you know,
cleanliness issues and this,
I go,
listen,

1614
01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:09.360
you're not supposed to kill fucking ants.

1615
01:30:09.361 --> 01:30:13.530
Like that's half the like how about vegans that have cats?

1616
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:16.830
Guess what?
Fuck face.
You're not a Vegan.
Okay.

1617
01:30:16.831 --> 01:30:20.280
If you have a cat and you're a Vegan and you're feeding your cat cat food,

1618
01:30:20.490 --> 01:30:25.200
you're feeding your cat,
murdered animals,
you are buying murdered animals.
You,

1619
01:30:25.230 --> 01:30:29.610
yourself,
you,
yourself are responsible for the death of animals.
Period.

1620
01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:31.740
Fact Jamie Kilstein,

1621
01:30:31.741 --> 01:30:34.830
all you fucking people that are vegans and post photos of your cats,

1622
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:38.190
those cats are murderers.
That's the only thing cats do.

1623
01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:41.550
If you have a cat and you tried to keep figure cat Vieten,
Vegan cat food,

1624
01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:45.000
they fucking go blind.
They start shitting themselves,
start walking into walls.

1625
01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:50.160
They don't get enough protein.
You can't feed them Vegan cat food.
They can't.

1626
01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:54.120
They can't exist like you go to forums like Vegan cat forms.

1627
01:30:54.121 --> 01:30:57.810
It's hilarious because post after post you see people saying,
well,

1628
01:30:57.811 --> 01:31:02.520
I've finally given in and I had to start feeding my cat regular cat food.

1629
01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:05.580
Of course your dad,
he's a little murderer.
You're catch a murderer is.

1630
01:31:06.090 --> 01:31:09.030
You're a person who believes that animals shouldn't die,

1631
01:31:09.031 --> 01:31:13.740
but you're contributing to those animals dying so that you feed your animal that

1632
01:31:13.741 --> 01:31:17.010
kills animals.
Do you understand how crazy this all is?

1633
01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:22.160
That highlights the whole hypocrisy of the idea of not taking life.

1634
01:31:22.770 --> 01:31:26.250
You take life.
Everybody takes life like takes like takes life.

1635
01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:29.760
Life takes life whether you like it or not.
Unfortunately,

1636
01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:34.200
it doesn't mean that you can't be a really good person and have a cat and only

1637
01:31:34.201 --> 01:31:36.780
contribute to a certain amount of cat murder.

1638
01:31:36.781 --> 01:31:41.220
Because look at these cats eat year,
next dirty monsters,

1639
01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:44.980
bread down,
but still dirty monsters at heart.
You,

1640
01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.850
you know the idea behind it is hilarious.

1641
01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:51.570
And I don't mean to single out the reason why I did it.
It's because somebody,

1642
01:31:51.571 --> 01:31:55.770
a vegans that I've run into who are these self righteous fuckers,

1643
01:31:55.771 --> 01:32:00.010
we'll take pictures with their cats like look at you.
That's not

1644
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:04.540
<v 1>being a Vegan.
You're bi,
you're spending money to get animals killed.</v>

1645
01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:05.440
That's a fact.

1646
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:08.740
Unless you're out there like unless you just let your cat forge for itself,

1647
01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:10.000
then you just live with a murderer.

1648
01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:12.790
You know you're a Vegan who lives with a murderer.
But if you're a Vegan,

1649
01:32:12.791 --> 01:32:16.240
he ground,
they're buying cat food.
Guess what dude?
You Ain't a Vegan.

1650
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:18.490
This is going to be a bit,

1651
01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:21.480
I hope so because I'm dying to the left with your fucking face.
Right?

1652
01:32:24.730 --> 01:32:28.050
Cause I actually listened to vegans.
It's getting deep with you lately.

1653
01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:31.620
We'll go on a wall with this a fuck cause it's going to war.

1654
01:32:31.630 --> 01:32:34.870
It's kind of on a wall like Tony Month that we can sell is my lower.

1655
01:32:34.871 --> 01:32:36.370
We're going to war.
He's like,
what?

1656
01:32:36.710 --> 01:32:39.790
We were going to war against self righteousness.
That's what it is.

1657
01:32:40.110 --> 01:32:43.490
It's it's people listen,
they miss the big picture.
Look up man,

1658
01:32:43.690 --> 01:32:44.940
when you worked at Fairfax,

1659
01:32:44.941 --> 01:32:49.090
but I'm sure there was some really cool people and then there was some real

1660
01:32:49.091 --> 01:32:52.930
fucking Douche bags when we went to bold,
let me tell you something man.

1661
01:32:52.931 --> 01:32:57.850
There was some lovely people in Boulder admin.
Brilliant,
brilliant,

1662
01:32:58.510 --> 01:33:01.750
and then they,
again,
this,
the people who are,
there's people out there,

1663
01:33:01.751 --> 01:33:05.890
60% of these people that pick a fucking hobby or whatever the fuck they call it

1664
01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:08.560
to hobby,
Bro.
It's a social activity anymore.

1665
01:33:09.010 --> 01:33:13.900
Religions have become a social activity.
You understand me?
Nobody becomes,

1666
01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:17.290
you know,
somebody does something.
It's because they really believe in it.

1667
01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:19.660
They really want to do it.
Not Anymore.

1668
01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:24.070
Dog and I don't even want dog people join something just to be a part of

1669
01:33:24.071 --> 01:33:28.190
something.
It's a social whatever.
That's a lot of it.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's

1670
01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:34.120
social brownie points to take it every day to take the high ground.
I'm bored,

1671
01:33:34.121 --> 01:33:37.630
I'm lonely.
What am I going to do?
I got three windows.
I might be gay.

1672
01:33:38.050 --> 01:33:39.850
I might save cats.
You know,

1673
01:33:39.851 --> 01:33:43.600
I was in Hollywood one day and I meet him and there was a guy behind me and he

1674
01:33:43.601 --> 01:33:48.310
was gay and I'm like,
this guy can not be this gauge,
Jamie,
Jamie,
this guy can,

1675
01:33:48.311 --> 01:33:50.680
I couldn't even not pay that guy because nobody's that game.

1676
01:33:50.710 --> 01:33:52.960
But there are people that gay,

1677
01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:58.650
this guy was that gay like two gay,
like,
Oh my God.
The whole thing,

1678
01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:02.470
the Cologne,
the scarf around the neck,
you know,
those guys that overdo it.

1679
01:34:02.471 --> 01:34:06.310
The Guy I could not develop,
but the guy,
I kidnapped my partner,

1680
01:34:06.311 --> 01:34:09.370
but it was going to be getting that mean I should stab myself every day for

1681
01:34:09.371 --> 01:34:13.540
having him as my partner.
He had everything I needed to be a guy.

1682
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:17.830
He had a pit bull.
He had a black car with tinted windows and a loud stereo.

1683
01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:21.670
He had a motorcycle.
He had a tattoo.
He hung out at strip clubs.

1684
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:25.600
He was that guy.
He was the common God.
You know,
who's your connection?

1685
01:34:25.601 --> 01:34:29.260
I can't tell you that right now.
Shut the fuck up.
You know he was that guy.

1686
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:33.970
You know,
it's the same thing in life and I see it every day.

1687
01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:37.590
People that hobbyists,
hobbyists,

1688
01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:40.390
this is a hobbyist stuff until the next mind fuck comes up,

1689
01:34:41.010 --> 01:34:45.490
you know they dive into something that's a yoga club.
They go that it's socially,

1690
01:34:45.491 --> 01:34:49.780
man.
It's socially,
God forbid,
you know,
walking in the street anymore.

1691
01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.180
Remember when we were kids?
When you ever go to a prom,

1692
01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:57.400
what do you call those parties in college?
Yeah,
whatever.

1693
01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:58.040
You got a

1694
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:02.450
<v 4>keg party.
How they salute your people.
It's an American thing</v>

1695
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:08.270
with the fucking Budweiser,
with the label.
So go cause got the bed.

1696
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:11.090
You can't see a label.
They shake your hand.
It's like a thing.

1697
01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:14.350
Go and walk the streets in the morning so they're holding.
I belabored,

1698
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:16.190
let you know they're in a certain group I'm in.

1699
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:21.290
I'm drinking a pap spoon out there.
I'm very ironic.
Okay,

1700
01:35:21.291 --> 01:35:23.810
but now it's turned into Starbucks.

1701
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:28.640
God forbid a human being doesn't have a Starbucks cup in their hand by eight

1702
01:35:28.641 --> 01:35:30.080
o'clock.
This society,

1703
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:35.300
God forbid if you work in an office and six people every day walking with a

1704
01:35:35.301 --> 01:35:39.320
Mocha,
soy,
almond,
you know,
gluten free,

1705
01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:42.200
sperm free,
fucking double latte.

1706
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:45.980
God forbid the guy who walks in with a seven 11 cup of coffee.

1707
01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:50.150
You know what I'm saying?
He's a loser.
It's pretty poor.

1708
01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:53.920
We all have to fucking hat that Starbucks cup.
You know it.

1709
01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:56.450
Starbucks that fucking great.
Really well.

1710
01:35:56.451 --> 01:35:58.590
You know what really is these days when you,

1711
01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.550
I mean nothing wrong with the coffee,
but with a lot of people are buying.

1712
01:36:01.551 --> 01:36:03.230
It's like a super sweet shake.

1713
01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.310
You're buying a super sweet shake that has caffeine in it,

1714
01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:11.300
whipped cream in it and fucking all those,
those venti things that people buy,

1715
01:36:11.301 --> 01:36:15.660
those blended things.
Ice Blended,
Vanilla,
soy.
You're,
you're,

1716
01:36:15.661 --> 01:36:19.480
it's a shake with drugs in an office dog.
I'm from New Jersey.

1717
01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:22.990
Give me that motherfucker black cause white come from black is beautiful.

1718
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.530
I The blue shirts gimme don't touch that when you're going to Jersey in the

1719
01:36:27.531 --> 01:36:28.850
mornings you drove a limo.

1720
01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:32.030
You know what it's like when you go and can you imagine going to a diner in

1721
01:36:32.031 --> 01:36:33.860
Boston to go,
you know what?
Let me get some soy milk.

1722
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:38.180
They would throw that fucking black coffee at you for 2000 years.

1723
01:36:38.190 --> 01:36:42.620
America drank a fucking from a cup that looked like a bowling ball,

1724
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:47.710
like a helmet that they put in the,
yeah.
Yup.
You got it.
What?

1725
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:50.570
What'd you say to regular?
What was your regular coffee?
We're growing up,

1726
01:36:50.571 --> 01:36:54.180
cream and sugar.
A little bit of cream,
but if it increased sugar,
white,

1727
01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:56.480
whatever the fuck.
That's it.
You go to Dunkin donuts,

1728
01:36:56.481 --> 01:36:59.150
you go ask for a regular coffee.
They give it to you with cream and sugar.

1729
01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:02.840
Come on today's stuff.
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.
Ask Her.

1730
01:37:02.841 --> 01:37:06.320
It was like this places we can go to this day.
I have a regular coffee.

1731
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:11.030
The point of cream for your pour,
a couple dashes of sugar for 36,000 years.

1732
01:37:11.031 --> 01:37:14.660
Americans ate a buttered roll every motherfucking these coasts hate a buttered

1733
01:37:14.661 --> 01:37:17.660
roll.
That's it.
Fuck the egg.
Fuck the gluten.

1734
01:37:17.661 --> 01:37:20.920
Fuck the protein angels were butter bagels or button.
I was like,

1735
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:23.300
every fucking corner I wasn't a city would have,

1736
01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:28.580
but it was wrapped up roles with,
with butter already buttered or wrapped up.

1737
01:37:28.581 --> 01:37:33.530
Bagels are any buttered fucking amazing.
I just needed some calories now.

1738
01:37:33.531 --> 01:37:36.380
But now it's like if you don't have a Starbucks fucking coffee.

1739
01:37:36.381 --> 01:37:40.130
So that lady you met in bold because,
let me tell you one thing about bold guy.

1740
01:37:40.131 --> 01:37:44.240
Believe bold.
The had a lot,
a lot bolder specializes in one thing.

1741
01:37:44.630 --> 01:37:48.160
They specialize if you're serious about your health and your life,
uh,

1742
01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.740
the value of your life.
People who value their lives.

1743
01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.250
Like somebody lives in a big city and one day he has a heart attack at 33

1744
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:59.670
<v 0>and he's a stockbroker and yeah,
he's got $30 million in the bank,</v>

1745
01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:02.580
but he's fucking 33.
Those guys,
when they degas,

1746
01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:06.240
it's over and they moved to bowl and they open up a bookstore

1747
01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:09.620
and you don't know,
you walked by there and then go,

1748
01:38:09.621 --> 01:38:11.220
how does this fucking Moke make a living?

1749
01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:15.630
It's people who want to enhance their lives and people realize that you don't

1750
01:38:15.631 --> 01:38:18.630
have to be around as many goddamn people.
I did Kevin and being yesterday,

1751
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:23.940
so I was up at five 50 I was in my car by 6:00 AM driving on the highway,

1752
01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:25.200
act

1753
01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:31.050
packed fucking 30 miles an hour going down the one on one.

1754
01:38:31.051 --> 01:38:33.780
It's six o'clock in the morning.
It was,
it's madness.

1755
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:37.140
God forbid you get there at seven 30 or eight it's death.

1756
01:38:37.170 --> 01:38:41.490
It's hot death for a dozen miles and there's too many motherfuckers.
Man,

1757
01:38:41.491 --> 01:38:44.490
it's not good for you.
It's not good for you if you have to live here.

1758
01:38:44.491 --> 01:38:47.250
I totally understand,
but you and I don't.
We don't have to live here.

1759
01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:49.650
We're on the road all the time.
I'm going to start skyping shit in.

1760
01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:51.660
I'm going to put Jamie and a God damn fish tank.

1761
01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:53.970
I'm going to start skyping from the middle of nowhere.

1762
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.040
I'm going to figure out how to do that or he should.
Fear does that.

1763
01:38:56.250 --> 01:38:58.620
When he does that punchdrunk podcast,
he's on the,

1764
01:38:58.621 --> 01:39:00.570
he's in New York and they're over here that you Skypes.

1765
01:39:00.571 --> 01:39:02.610
These guys is a little corner,
a little fucking square.

1766
01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:08.610
It's an amazing how if I get on the plane when I travel,
I get to,

1767
01:39:08.630 --> 01:39:11.640
I get to 6:00 AM because let me tell you something,

1768
01:39:12.630 --> 01:39:14.040
You going look at me and say,
no way.

1769
01:39:14.041 --> 01:39:18.120
There's a huge difference on the four oh five from 10 to six and 10 and a half

1770
01:39:18.121 --> 01:39:20.790
to six.
It's miraculous.
Oh yeah.

1771
01:39:20.850 --> 01:39:23.130
It's something you'd never say it and I'll do it with you.

1772
01:39:23.131 --> 01:39:26.670
I'm going to have five days a week and go,

That's 10 to six.

1773
01:39:26.671 --> 01:39:30.920
You see it moving.
Watch 10 after six blank claim.

1774
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:34.690
We'll get an Hov lane.

Unbelievable.

1780
01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:53.160
I get to the fucking airport.

1781
01:39:53.161 --> 01:39:56.390
I park at the three right by the elevator and I'm going to doubt,

1782
01:39:56.610 --> 01:39:58.530
you know what I do sometimes if I've got a wild hair up my ass,

1783
01:39:58.950 --> 01:40:01.740
I'll take my car up into the mountains.
Like,

1784
01:40:01.741 --> 01:40:04.210
do you ever go up Angeles Crest Highway?
I don't know.

1785
01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:07.530
Angeles crest highway off the to 10.
If you go off to two 10.

1786
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:12.030
And do you like driving from uh,
like uh,
this studio towards Pasadena?

1787
01:40:12.210 --> 01:40:16.080
If you went up,
uh,
through,
um,
the one 18 to the to 10,

1788
01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:19.650
there's an area called the Angeles crest highway and he'd take it up into the

1789
01:40:19.651 --> 01:40:21.180
mountains,
just a two lane road.

1790
01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:23.250
And if you go up there and like five o'clock in the morning,

1791
01:40:23.251 --> 01:40:25.050
six o'clock in the morning,
it's fucking dead empty.

1792
01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:28.620
And right when the sun starts to come up and just drive,
just drive up there,

1793
01:40:28.710 --> 01:40:31.690
just drive up there and see the mountains and the hills and there's not a

1794
01:40:31.691 --> 01:40:33.900
fucking sold insight when you could do that.

1795
01:40:33.901 --> 01:40:38.400
When you can get on the highway and you see like one car a mile up and one car

1796
01:40:38.401 --> 01:40:40.260
like a mile back and that's it.

1797
01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:42.960
Just you three motherfuckers from one guy going this way.
One goes,

1798
01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:44.310
it's like relaxing.

1799
01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:48.750
It gives you a feeling of peace because you're so constantly concentrating on

1800
01:40:48.751 --> 01:40:49.860
all these motherfuckers,

1801
01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:53.140
this guy next to use in a truck and this guy next to you is kind of weaving in

1802
01:40:53.141 --> 01:40:56.020
that Elaine's and this motherfucker in front of you is going too slow and it's

1803
01:40:56.021 --> 01:40:59.320
like so much shit to think about when you could just get on a highway and

1804
01:40:59.321 --> 01:41:04.270
there's no nobody.
It's a peaceful feeling.
He just took off.
You forget driving.

1805
01:41:04.271 --> 01:41:05.920
It's nice.
Remember when you were a little kid,

1806
01:41:05.921 --> 01:41:09.400
you first got your driver's license and you're like,
Woo,
I get to jet.

1807
01:41:09.401 --> 01:41:12.070
Not a little kid,
but you know,
18 whatever you first get to.

1808
01:41:12.071 --> 01:41:16.960
Do you remember magic four year olds were driving like driving is fun.

1809
01:41:16.961 --> 01:41:19.540
Like my six year old,
she's learning how to ride a bike.

1810
01:41:19.570 --> 01:41:21.880
So I'm teaching her to ride a bike without training.
Wheels are moving around,

1811
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.240
showing her do tight turns and stuff,
and she's having the time of her life.

1812
01:41:25.570 --> 01:41:28.840
And I'm thinking if I had to drive a bike in this little fucking ass driveway,

1813
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:33.850
I would be so bored.
But to a six year old,
it's like,
Woo,
it's so fun.

1814
01:41:34.150 --> 01:41:36.550
That's what it's like when you first start driving the car.

1815
01:41:36.610 --> 01:41:40.600
It's fun and you forget like driving a car.
Just it's a pleasure.

1816
01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:45.340
If you have a car that works right and you're out on a nice road and there's no

1817
01:41:45.341 --> 01:41:49.230
one there.
Oh Jeez.
Google.

1818
01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.780
A beautiful view of beautiful view to look out at.

1819
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:56.530
That's the thing that really gets me about Colorado more than anything is the

1820
01:41:56.531 --> 01:42:00.520
sheer beauty of the landscape boulder.
Like how about evergreen?

1821
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:03.220
When you're driving from evergreen down into Denver,

1822
01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:07.090
people will know about evergreen,
evergreen I half an hour outside of Denver.

1823
01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:09.600
<v 1>You see those green trees like that.</v>

1824
01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:13.690
<v 0>You might as well be on that mountain men TV show.</v>

1825
01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:17.290
You might as well be one of those fucking dudes that makes their own.
Would you?

1826
01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:20.770
You're up there in the middle of the fucking mountain.
30 minutes from Denver.

1827
01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:23.013
Beautiful.

1828
01:42:23.290 --> 01:42:27.550
<v 1>I remember the last time I had peace of mind was I was shooting the longest yard</v>

1829
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:31.510
and I was off on Saturdays and Sundays and they opted,
they said,

1830
01:42:31.511 --> 01:42:34.450
you can to go home and stay.
I would stay in the hotel,

1831
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:39.870
the hotel BMV it'd be a couple of us that would stay down there and I would get

1832
01:42:40.271 --> 01:42:44.960
the rental car dog and I would get on that road.
I go to Taos.

1833
01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.550
Oh yeah.
I drive to all those places.
I stopped get a Green Chili,

1834
01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:53.800
all hippies.
I turned the fucking car around three,
four hours,
no traffic,

1835
01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:57.850
no traffic.
I just get on there,
whatever road.
I don't know what it was.
Now

1836
01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:02.280
<v 0>you ever do that drive from San Diego to Vegas?</v>

1837
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.470
Fuck yeah.
That's a nice drive.
Beautiful drive.

1838
01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:09.210
When you go through those weird desert areas and you get to see those,
uh,

1839
01:43:09.570 --> 01:43:12.660
I went to the,
uh,
the air force base.
I forget which base it is down there,

1840
01:43:12.690 --> 01:43:16.650
where the blue angels are.
I did a,
I forgot,
I forget the name of it,

1841
01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:20.970
but I had to drive down to San Diego and then from San Diego I had to go across

1842
01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:25.650
like quite a while to to get to this air force base where they took me on a

1843
01:43:25.651 --> 01:43:30.450
flight with the blue angels and you're driving through these desert areas where

1844
01:43:30.451 --> 01:43:33.840
these beautiful rock formations and shit,
it's gorgeous out there.

1845
01:43:33.870 --> 01:43:37.380
Just as long as you have ac,
it's fucking gorgeous.
Like seeing the,

1846
01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:41.720
the cool rock structures and shit.
It's a pleasure.
You know,
people forget you.

1847
01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:46.170
We live here in La and we associate driving with being a pain the ass.

1848
01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:47.970
How sad is that?
Sad?

1849
01:43:48.110 --> 01:43:52.220
<v 1>It's like,
it's fucking like,
he like wake up the morning,
your feet like,
fuck,</v>

1850
01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:57.390
I've got to go to Holly with a two 30 God dammit.
God fucking dammit.

1851
01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:59.840
And you start looking and then you get on the phone.

1852
01:43:59.870 --> 01:44:03.440
You just put it on channel five and that telling you got one oh one there's an

1853
01:44:03.441 --> 01:44:04.640
accident on the way here,
Bro.

1854
01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:08.310
I left my house and fucking 10 20 I should have been here early.

1855
01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:14.150
I fucking car flipped on the other side as I was driving.

1856
01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:16.940
The people are hanging by their fucking seat belts.

1857
01:44:16.941 --> 01:44:20.360
I mean it was that far left when I was in my far left.
Wow.

1858
01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:23.240
So I got to see it in three motherfuckers out there.

1859
01:44:23.241 --> 01:44:28.090
Fucking cameras with TMC course.
Jesus Christ,
Joe Rogan.
That's,

1860
01:44:28.330 --> 01:44:30.680
that's justifiable homicide where I come from.

1861
01:44:30.681 --> 01:44:34.790
But it's just to shoot him right that pull over what is wrong with you.

1862
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:38.660
If somebody is yelling for their life and you have your fucking camera on you.

1863
01:44:38.661 --> 01:44:40.010
Miserable motherfucker.

1864
01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:43.010
And there was people getting out of their cars helping them.

1865
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:46.550
I mean it was bumper to bumper.
I don't know how to fucking ambulance.

1866
01:44:46.551 --> 01:44:49.040
Just going to get in.
Yeah.
Well that's sometimes,

1867
01:44:49.041 --> 01:44:53.040
but welcome to the fucking world to canvas my friends.
Yeah.

1868
01:44:54.090 --> 01:44:55.970
Yeah.
Cheat.
Somebody is yelling for their life.

1869
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.550
You're going to fucking camera on for a love of Christ.

1870
01:44:59.150 --> 01:45:01.070
What kind of God damn human being are you?

1871
01:45:01.130 --> 01:45:03.890
I just to extend your hand for the person to see your hand.

1872
01:45:04.110 --> 01:45:07.290
<v 0>You know what's fucked up though.
You talk to them and they're nice guys.</v>

1873
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:10.410
Look a lot of those TMZ camera guys thought it was guys are very nice guy.

1874
01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:13.200
I don't even know if it was a TMZ guy.
They were three people.

1875
01:45:13.530 --> 01:45:16.510
There was two people with cell phones and the guy had like a little fucking
damn.

1876
01:45:16.530 --> 01:45:17.191
I was like,
well,

1877
01:45:17.191 --> 01:45:19.620
some people are just filming it because they're there and they had to have,

1878
01:45:19.670 --> 01:45:22.470
I mean some people,
if they have something on them that can record,

1879
01:45:22.471 --> 01:45:23.790
they have to record things.
Oh my God,

1880
01:45:23.791 --> 01:45:25.110
I can't believe it's when we get this on video.

1881
01:45:25.650 --> 01:45:29.130
But there's a lot of these guys are just guys who have a job.

1882
01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:33.480
It's the real problem is that people want to read that shit.
You know?

1883
01:45:33.481 --> 01:45:36.000
That's the real problem,
including us.
It's compelling.

1884
01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:39.600
You find out about some crazy story.
It's some nasty shit happen.

1885
01:45:39.630 --> 01:45:43.800
TMZ has a video of it.
You don't go to it ever.
No.
TMZ,

1886
01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:47.670
if it was used to watch it two,
three years ago,
so six o'clock now,

1887
01:45:47.671 --> 01:45:49.890
I just watched the news.
If there's something,

1888
01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:53.190
something fucking completely crazy happens,
you're going to,
you know,

1889
01:45:53.490 --> 01:45:55.560
people are gonna want to see it.
They're going to want to see a video.

1890
01:45:55.860 --> 01:46:00.060
<v 1>What's a sub with snoop?
Whatever got knocked out.
I was curious.</v>

1891
01:46:00.610 --> 01:46:04.250
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
The Valet guy knocked the man.

1892
01:46:05.130 --> 01:46:09.150
I'm a record producer.
Uh,
you know,
not puff Daddy,

1893
01:46:09.151 --> 01:46:10.770
but the guy from the west coast rap.

1894
01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:16.400
<v 0>We always talk about shook night.
Sorry.
Yeah,
Barbara knocked him out,</v>

1895
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:19.940
right?
Some,
some do two in the barbershop in La.
But he was a valet,
right?

1896
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:24.080
I don't think so.
I think it was out value.
Yeah.
Oh,
out of valley.
Okay.

1897
01:46:24.110 --> 01:46:27.950
I don't remember exactly what happened,
but yeah.
Yeah.

1898
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:31.640
We live in a weird world.
See those videos all the time.
Every day.

1899
01:46:31.641 --> 01:46:34.430
There's new ones.
Have you did is,
it's some new thing.

1900
01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:37.040
Jamie watches all that shit.
Every time I come in here,

1901
01:46:37.041 --> 01:46:40.630
this motherfucker's got some new Beyonce story for me.
I always find that late.

1902
01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:45.430
Like I found out about the Tei,
what happened with,
oh,
the Mayweather.

1903
01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:48.440
I never saw that,
but that would be assessed the videos online,
you know,
tea.

1904
01:46:48.441 --> 01:46:52.050
I went on opie Anthony on for that.
It was fucking hilarious.
It's really funny.

1905
01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:55.890
It's like a real relaxed dude.
He's a fun dude.
It was interesting to listen to.

1906
01:46:56.830 --> 01:46:58.170
I Dunno.
I just,
I mean,

1907
01:46:58.171 --> 01:47:03.171
I don't even know if the video or the appearance on opiate Anthony was after

1908
01:47:03.721 --> 01:47:08.070
that fight.
I was just in my car and they were talking and you know,

1909
01:47:08.071 --> 01:47:12.540
you look at the serious,
it shows you who the guest is and it said t it was fun.

1910
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:14.820
It's fun guy,
man.
Looks like he's having a good time with them.

1911
01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:19.920
Can you get busted with guts?
Yes.
He's looks like a fun guy.
He did a movie.

1912
01:47:20.370 --> 01:47:24.260
He did American fucking gangster.
He was an American gangster.
Yeah,
he's the bass,

1913
01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:25.230
but Denzel Washington,

1914
01:47:25.530 --> 01:47:28.800
he's the one that was the baseball player that he got him a track with.

1915
01:47:28.801 --> 01:47:33.150
The Yankees is show up.
It goes up to,
he goes,
how can we didn't show up.
He goes,

1916
01:47:33.151 --> 01:47:36.690
I have,
why am I going to play baseball for?
I won't be like,
oh,
that's funny.

1917
01:47:37.110 --> 01:47:39.540
Did you see the ads for the new James Brown movie?

1918
01:47:40.590 --> 01:47:43.470
They got a James Brown movie who's playing days,
Bro.
I don't know.
Some dude,

1919
01:47:43.471 --> 01:47:47.990
I don't know.
Here.
Let's pull it up.
Brown movie.
Uh,

1920
01:47:48.030 --> 01:47:52.530
I went to see the Tom Cruise movie last night.
Tomorrow.
It's fucking great.

1921
01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:57.450
That movie is Great.
It's really good,
man.
It's called get on up.

1922
01:47:57.930 --> 01:47:59.820
Get up.
Park.
Get on up.

1923
01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:05.010
The dude's name is Chadwick Bozeman.
Hmm.

1924
01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:09.360
I don't know who that is.
Do you know who that is?
Chadwick.
Bozeman.
Okay.

1925
01:48:10.050 --> 01:48:14.010
Handsome Fella.
Been at a bunch of shit.
He's been,
he was on all my children.

1926
01:48:15.690 --> 01:48:20.370
No Way.
It's just 1970.
It must be a different guy.
James Brown,
the movie comes up.

1927
01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:25.050
Chadwick Bozeman.
It came out.
It can't be,
it says all my children.

1928
01:48:25.051 --> 01:48:28.290
1970.
It's gotta be a different Chadwick.
Bowman.
You'd dummies.

1929
01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:33.030
That doesn't make any sense.
The guys,
he's not that old.

1930
01:48:33.330 --> 01:48:35.550
Maybe it was a kid on the shutter.
No,
he's not.

1931
01:48:35.551 --> 01:48:39.240
Even that would mean you'd have to be what?
40 something years old?
No Way.

1932
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:44.820
So the movie came out already?
Uh,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1933
01:48:44.821 --> 01:48:49.190
It's not out yet.
It's a,
the,
the ads for it right now.

1934
01:48:49.290 --> 01:48:53.150
He was in that movie 42 he played Jackie Roberts.
Oh,
that dude's bad ass.
Okay.

1935
01:48:53.170 --> 01:48:57.230
Yeah.
That was a good movie though.
I heard it was really good.
It was good.

1936
01:48:57.231 --> 01:48:59.010
He was very good.
You know what was good in that movie?

1937
01:48:59.650 --> 01:49:04.200
You know who was fucking bad ass who we thought Harrison fucking forward.

1938
01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:08.050
Oh yeah,
yeah.
He was the skies.
Harrison Ford.

1939
01:49:09.330 --> 01:49:13.590
He said some shit that you're like,
look at fucking Harrison Ford selling.

1940
01:49:13.591 --> 01:49:15.180
It isn't interesting.

1941
01:49:15.181 --> 01:49:20.130
This dude's plant two famous dead black dudes like Jackie Robinson and then he's

1942
01:49:20.131 --> 01:49:23.840
there.
Goto guide dog.
You need a shirt.
Sag Insurance is a motherfucker.

1943
01:49:23.850 --> 01:49:27.390
You know what I'm saying?
You got to do with your guts to do sometimes.

1944
01:49:29.210 --> 01:49:32.790
Get up that fucking Tom cruise movie is good man.
I'm telling you.

1945
01:49:32.791 --> 01:49:35.720
It's one of the most original science fiction movies I've ever seen.
It's really,

1946
01:49:35.730 --> 01:49:38.760
I had low expectations.
I went into it.

1947
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:41.040
I thought it was going to be some shooting.
My upward.

1948
01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:44.370
Tom Cruise does a standard shit and every one of them is standard,
you know,

1949
01:49:44.371 --> 01:49:47.890
like calm,
cool,
collected,
you know,
facing the adversity.
No,

1950
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:52.480
it was a complex character that he had a play and the movie was very complex.

1951
01:49:52.481 --> 01:49:55.720
It was.
There was a lot going on.
It was like about time travel.

1952
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:58.270
That was part of the movie is an alien movie,

1953
01:49:58.271 --> 01:50:00.890
an alien invasion movie about time travel.
I can't tell you anymore.

1954
01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:04.750
I'll give you a spoiler alert,
but it's fucking good.

1955
01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:06.650
Movie Man is a good fucking movie.

1956
01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:10.060
Like I'd give it a nine out of 10 is a really good movie.

1957
01:50:10.061 --> 01:50:12.430
Like one of the most original science fiction movies I've ever seen.

1958
01:50:12.490 --> 01:50:16.600
You see it in three d?
No,
no.
I just taught regular.
I'm only wearing glasses.

1959
01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:20.080
I'll give you see the movie king of New York.
Yeah.
All right.
Fuck yeah,

1960
01:50:20.590 --> 01:50:24.700
great movement.
But a year ago for walking Casa t ray,
this dude on Twitter,
Tobin,

1961
01:50:24.730 --> 01:50:27.820
I'm like,
fuck,
that movie's overrated.
This fuck.
It was

1962
01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:32.430
holy Shit Joe Rogan.
But to me he didn't do,

1963
01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:35.020
I mean Christopher Walkers always Christopher Walken,
right?

1964
01:50:35.170 --> 01:50:38.620
Laurence Fishburne stole that motherfucker.
Laurence Fishburne

1965
01:50:38.690 --> 01:50:42.650
<v 1>stole that motherfucker.
Listen,
I come loosen that.</v>

1966
01:50:42.651 --> 01:50:47.020
He's the best black actor now and I'll prove it to you.
You know when the,

1967
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:49.430
when he beats the chicken,
the movie Tina Turner,

1968
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:53.660
he plays a different type of black dude.
Don't make me say it.

1969
01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:56.300
And then whatever,

1970
01:50:56.630 --> 01:50:59.270
he plays a completely different type of black dude.

1971
01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:01.100
But the opening of that movie,

1972
01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:05.780
he goes to [inaudible] house to buy the coke with Steve was Chevy and Steve was

1973
01:51:05.781 --> 01:51:09.020
shammies uh,
uh,
what do you call that shit?
Weighing out the coke,

1974
01:51:09.021 --> 01:51:14.021
making sure it's good and fucking Laurence Fishburne is torturing this drug

1975
01:51:14.541 --> 01:51:17.300
deal.
Yo,
you play ball not and not by looking at you.

1976
01:51:17.630 --> 01:51:20.660
You've got a coke and he keeps torturing him,
torture him.

1977
01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:25.070
And then finally the guy,
you want the fucking drugs,
you fucking black guy,

1978
01:51:25.071 --> 01:51:26.060
I don't do business.

1979
01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:29.810
And it gives him the thing and the guy's about to open up the briefcase,

1980
01:51:29.811 --> 01:51:32.150
the check the money and he fucking slams.
And he goes,

1981
01:51:32.510 --> 01:51:36.530
where's my mother fucking coke?
Which is classic.

1982
01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:40.220
And he finally opens it up and this all tampons.
And he goes,

1983
01:51:40.221 --> 01:51:44.030
what the fuck is this to plug your mother fucking holes?
And he shoots him in.

1984
01:51:44.031 --> 01:51:47.390
The black guy comes through room service and they started shooting people.

1985
01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:50.410
That's the best opening any fucking movie I've seen.

1986
01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:55.430
I forgot all about that more.
I sat there going,
what the fuck is this?
Tremendous.

1987
01:51:55.850 --> 01:51:59.840
Tremendous.
I recommend,
if you haven't seen in a long time,
Christopher Walken.

1988
01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:04.850
Well,
you know what you said in that movie dog,
the black dude from lost,

1989
01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:08.660
he's the kid on the elevator that goes to Mug Christopher Walken,
me,

1990
01:52:08.661 --> 01:52:11.780
Christopher Walken throws him like 10,000 and goes,
come see me,

1991
01:52:11.781 --> 01:52:14.480
I'll give you a job.
They look at the money they take off.

1992
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:16.100
That's the little black dude from the launch.

1993
01:52:16.101 --> 01:52:19.610
That was also these thousand things.
It was a young kid.

1994
01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:23.510
Really like a young kid,
like you know,
2018,
no shit.

1995
01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:26.420
It's amazing when you see these old movies and you're like,
wow,

1996
01:52:27.290 --> 01:52:32.290
look what the fuck that is playing one scene like in the thief Manhunter that

1997
01:52:33.171 --> 01:52:35.360
dude that was CSI for 18 years.

1998
01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:40.370
<v 0>It was on a,
the dude from loss was on,
um,

1999
01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:45.020

the Prison Oz.
He was in Oz was too.
Yeah.
The guy in the wheelchair.

2000
01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:46.070
Yeah.
That dude's

2001
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:49.880
<v 1>been around.
You look at these guys go.
What the fuck?
Yeah.</v>

2002
01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:52.460
How about Laurence Fishburne?
It was in fucking apocalypse now.

2003
01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:56.690
I talked to him one day before they were fucking weed store.
No Shit.

2004
01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:01.340
He was talking to me about how he was 14 and he would bring his mother down

2005
01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:04.640
there cause they shot that in the Philippines.
They were there for a year,
Bro.

2006
01:53:04.770 --> 01:53:09.590
Wow.
He was a kid and I that boat,
he was 14 years old,
15 years old.

2007
01:53:09.591 --> 01:53:10.440
He was a fucking child.

2008
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:14.400
He was really young and that movie took a long time to fill.
Two years too.

2009
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:18.990
That's where the studios were just at.
Marlon Brando was on that.

2010
01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:23.220
So Marlon Brando,
this is what this motherfucker did.
They met with them.

2011
01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:25.880
They're like,
mom,
we love you but get it together.

2012
01:53:26.130 --> 01:53:29.750
You're a little getting a little heavy.
You're playing a fucking major.

2013
01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:32.810
You're playing a guy who parachutes out of plates.

2014
01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:37.560
Please work out how much the trailer caught you.
Give him a check for the train.

2015
01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:41.150
What do they want?
10,000 give a 20 get the best train to lose the weight.

2016
01:53:41.151 --> 01:53:45.500
Mauler took the check.
Absolutely thought post time that motherfucker showed up,

2017
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:49.850
20 pounds overweight.
And when he was at the meeting,
they were furious.

2018
01:53:49.851 --> 01:53:51.350
That's why all the seeds that dark,

2019
01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:54.800
that's why the only show his head and shit holding his head.

2020
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:57.980
They never showed his body.
That's why.
Cause they were like,

2021
01:53:58.010 --> 01:54:02.000
fuck what the fuck.
We gave you money for a train,
a dog.

2022
01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:04.220
I spent the money at spa goes,
you know what I'm saying?

2023
01:54:04.221 --> 01:54:07.790
How did we have an island at one point in time when he shot,
listen,

2024
01:54:09.050 --> 01:54:13.340
if you're into this shit cause I'm into stupidity.
Okay.
Me and Joe Rogan,

2025
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:18.020
Chase Coburn and sunset boulevard.
I meant to those old actors,

2026
01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:19.760
they represented something different.

2027
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:24.560
They represent and Marlon Brando represented something completely different in

2028
01:54:24.561 --> 01:54:29.360
my eyes.
This kid was from Nebraska.
This kid was from fucking Nebraska.

2029
01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:32.780
You know everybody's stuck on James Deane,
focus off fucking brand.

2030
01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:37.640
This guy came out here and just fuck people up.
And they hated him.

2031
01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:40.770
They hated him.
You know

2032
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.481
<v 0>Rhoda,</v>

2033
01:54:41.481 --> 01:54:45.620
hilarious fucking letter to Charlie Sheen when he couldn't make his birthday

2034
01:54:45.621 --> 01:54:48.050
party,
he wrote,
Dear Charlie,

2035
01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:52.130
I'm feeling like a very large Turd on a very thin stick.

2036
01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:57.280
I'm holed up in bed and taking everything from sled dog urine to power.

2037
01:54:57.381 --> 01:55:00.560
Ade Power,
Power D.
I dunno.

2038
01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:05.830
Eastern Indian Vulva maybe won't work tomorrow if I feel the same.

2039
01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:11.810
That's what he sent him when he was thinking about not going to his party

2040
01:55:12.930 --> 01:55:15.330
<v 1>who was out there.
They didn't want all for the Godfather.</v>

2041
01:55:15.331 --> 01:55:18.210
You know how I a push for him for the Godfather,
I use crazy.

2042
01:55:18.211 --> 01:55:20.640
He didn't give a fuck.
What the fuck?
And then he showed up.

2043
01:55:20.641 --> 01:55:23.310
They know who the fuck he was.
He put the cotton in his mouth,
this shit.

2044
01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:26.880
And he just blew him out of the water that that gave him?
No.

2045
01:55:26.881 --> 01:55:27.890
Before that they gave him,

2046
01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:32.900
what's that movie that we cost the studio 80,000 he was directly a whatever the

2047
01:55:33.661 --> 01:55:34.560
fuck about the boat.

2048
01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:39.180
And they went down and they realized they get that and they're like,

2049
01:55:39.181 --> 01:55:42.660
where's my brand though?
He said the hot fucking six fucking Hawaiian chicks.

2050
01:55:42.930 --> 01:55:44.150
That's what he married the check

2051
01:55:44.530 --> 01:55:47.130
<v 4>and he was a crazy motherfuckers.
Crazy mother fucker.</v>

2052
01:55:47.131 --> 01:55:50.530
Then he came back dog and he just,
he then he,
he's sent that Indian,

2053
01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:55.580
so the fucking Oscars to protest the fucking American movies does this shit and

2054
01:55:59.041 --> 01:56:01.500
at the end of his life he didn't he live,

2055
01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:04.320
I mean he lived on an island or something.
Right.
Did he do something like that?

2056
01:56:04.321 --> 01:56:08.400
I think he lived in studio city.
I sweat.
Yeah,
he lived around here.
Yeah.

2057
01:56:08.401 --> 01:56:10.980
He lived around here at the end of the island.
He lost the island.

2058
01:56:11.250 --> 01:56:15.810
He lost the island.
Okay.
That,
but that was also a tragic side.
He lost his kids.

2059
01:56:16.590 --> 01:56:19.410
It was very sad.
That whole thing would happen,
but well,

2060
01:56:19.411 --> 01:56:22.620
you can imagine the guy looked that would be really good at taking care of kids.

2061
01:56:22.650 --> 01:56:24.590
You know what?
He was really bad at it.
Acid.

2062
01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:27.240
I didn't realize it because I didn't listen.

2063
01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:32.160
I have to watch it because my wife watches the man of steel.
Oh,

2064
01:56:32.161 --> 01:56:35.820
that movie.
Yeah.
Movie.
But I look Kevin Crow,
but

2065
01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:37.120
<v 5>okay.</v>

2066
01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:40.810
<v 4>Not Good.
Marlon Brando cemented that role.
Soul Straw.</v>

2067
01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:45.220
That speech.
He tells him before he puts them in the fucking thing,
bro.
Yeah.

2068
01:56:45.850 --> 01:56:49.510
That's what had to be Super Mad.
If your father tells you to speech,

2069
01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:53.470
if your father look Shinier,
I told you that speech,
you've got to be superman.

2070
01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:58.210
That's it.
You're like that.
You just blew my fucking mind.
It was amazing.

2071
01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:01.270
And we had a lease of an island.
Yeah.
1966.

2072
01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:05.560
He got a 99 year lease.
The island of this,

2073
01:57:05.561 --> 01:57:09.610
I don't know how to say this is t e T.
I n.
A R O,

2074
01:57:09.670 --> 01:57:13.290
a Ted [inaudible] row by uh,

2075
01:57:13.330 --> 01:57:16.300
Tahiti government making him it's sole owner,

2076
01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:20.800
35 miles from the main island of Tahiti.
It's a group of 13,
uh,

2077
01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:25.450
Islet Small Islands measuring about 27 square miles and surrounded by a lagoon.

2078
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:28.270
Fucking dude lived up there on an eco resort.

2079
01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:30.273
<v 5>Wow.</v>

2080
01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:31.853
<v 4>Crazy man.</v>

2081
01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:33.070
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2082
01:57:33.070 --> 01:57:34.660
<v 4>Strange,
strange dude,
man.</v>

2083
01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:37.630
You know there's a roommate used to charge to read your script.

2084
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:44.440
He used to charge you to read your script.
Like if you go a studio,
say hi Marla,

2085
01:57:44.441 --> 01:57:48.010
we have a script for you.
Okay.
50 g's.

2086
01:57:49.450 --> 01:57:52.120
He would bang you at every level.
That makes sense though.

2087
01:57:52.121 --> 01:57:55.840
If you're Marlon fucking Brando,
you know,
25 to read the script.

2088
01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:57.610
Do you want me to come off the island for a meeting?

2089
01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:03.500
I'm gonna have Herbie call you right on that one.

2090
01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:05.070
That's when you're a bad mother fucker.

2091
01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:07.150
When they're willing to fly into an island to talk to,

2092
01:58:07.330 --> 01:58:08.980
and if you want it to fly him off,

2093
01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:13.480
it will be you like triple to fly him off the island.
Yeah.
Like,
oh no,

2094
01:58:13.481 --> 01:58:14.710
we want you to come to Hollywood

2095
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:20.020
to show up with this crazy hat on.

2096
01:58:20.410 --> 01:58:24.190
What do we have here for this group of 600 pounds,
400 pounds?

2097
01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:27.790
Apparently he would sign up to do movies to hadn't read it at all and would make

2098
01:58:27.791 --> 01:58:31.420
them put up these big placards with all the lines that he had to say like right

2099
01:58:31.421 --> 01:58:35.630
behind them.
As we end,
we just free ball it on the side.
I don't,
I don't,
uh,

2100
01:58:36.250 --> 01:58:37.840
I think that the Americans,

2101
01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:42.100
I think people itself sometimes take to

2102
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:46.640
<v 1>sacredly,
you know,
but if like in the Godfather,</v>

2103
01:58:46.641 --> 01:58:48.130
the scene where he's at the table,

2104
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:51.700
he's talking about if something should happen to my son and he gets up,

2105
01:58:51.730 --> 01:58:55.330
that's what they said he was reading off.
The guys are,
pals is shit.

2106
01:58:55.960 --> 01:59:00.520
But look at them.
See if you see him really at the end.

2107
01:59:00.521 --> 01:59:04.020
Maybe like 1972 when he was dropping the gun.

2108
01:59:04.090 --> 01:59:07.210
The Godfather has been on HBO this month,
eight 30 in the morning.

2109
01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:08.920
You know what I mean?
I get up at six.

2110
01:59:08.921 --> 01:59:10.650
I'm watching the news all or sudden the Godfather,

2111
01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:14.560
I gotta catch 10 minutes of it.
Last night.
I watched the scene when the,

2112
01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:20.260
he told,
what's his name,
he was out.
He was brilliant,
Bro.
He told,

2113
01:59:20.261 --> 01:59:24.340
uh,
uh,
the constantly,
I read the White Dude,
he tells him,
he goes,

2114
01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:28.090
we're going to Vegas.
He just got out of the hospital and he goes,
you know,

2115
01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:32.290
you're any smacks me goes,
no offense.
Let Michael,
I'm going to do this.

2116
01:59:32.291 --> 01:59:34.630
And he goes,
but I can help you.
And Michael Goes,
you're out.

2117
01:59:35.610 --> 01:59:39.490
He gets up and leaves.
He's beautiful,
Bro.
He's beautiful.

2118
01:59:39.491 --> 01:59:42.760
So no matter if he was reading cards and Shit,
you know,
we forget.

2119
01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:44.560
You forget bro.

2120
01:59:44.570 --> 01:59:49.000
You if we forget because we were subjected to such bad fucking movies.

2121
01:59:49.570 --> 01:59:52.510
But I watched that movie again,
the idea,
and I'd been watching pieces.

2122
01:59:52.511 --> 01:59:56.260
I don't have the time to sit and watch three hours,
but it's been on HBO.

2123
01:59:56.261 --> 01:59:57.970
And I watched the scene where he comes down,

2124
01:59:58.390 --> 02:00:02.900
he tells Duval cars are coming to my house,
telling you to do vowels.

2125
02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:06.520
Another one was great,
you know,
tell you don what everybody seems to know.

2126
02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:10.480
And he goes,
oh,
I was about to,
but you had to have a drink.

2127
02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:13.600
Takes a drink out of his hand.
[inaudible] he goes,
now you're adjunct drink.

2128
02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:17.590
I get goosebumps.
I've seen that seen a hundred times.

2129
02:00:18.190 --> 02:00:21.160
I still get goosebumps.
Sproul.
Well,
he looks at sunny.

2130
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:24.670
He throws that curtain down on that table and he tells that,
dude,

2131
02:00:24.671 --> 02:00:27.880
look how they massacred my son.
Are you fucking kidding me?

2132
02:00:28.450 --> 02:00:30.420
Are you fucking kidding me yet?
Go ahead.

2133
02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:32.560
Get the guy from Anglican gangs in New York,

2134
02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:36.220
he'll take that guy and break them and fucking hat by his neck like a j.

2135
02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:41.950
At that time,
that dude was dropping it on you with cue cards,

2136
02:00:41.951 --> 02:00:44.050
with whatever.
It didn't matter.
It didn't matter.

2137
02:00:44.051 --> 02:00:46.210
He knew who the fuck he was in a way in there.

2138
02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:49.200
<v 0>You know what's interesting man is,
hey did last tango in Paris.</v>

2139
02:00:49.201 --> 02:00:50.100
That's what's interesting.

2140
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:55.350
There isn't a Porto after that and they really last tango in Paris.

2141
02:00:55.561 --> 02:01:00.210
Look at this homework for that.
Yeah,
it was porno.
Why do you say as a porn,

2142
02:01:00.211 --> 02:01:03.360
it was this close to Portland as could be that they really look at the,

2143
02:01:03.420 --> 02:01:05.490
look at the poster for it.
I'm looking at it every second,

2144
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:08.610
nine and a half weeks kind of porn.
Yeah,

2145
02:01:08.611 --> 02:01:11.400
it's him and some broad I'm making out and this thing,

2146
02:01:11.850 --> 02:01:16.260
Italian American Franco Italian romantic or erotic drama.
Wow.
I never saw that.

2147
02:01:16.290 --> 02:01:20.850
Yeah,
he's crazy.
That too.
He puts light bulbs in a pussy,
white water and shit.

2148
02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:26.060
Ball snap like vinegarette the original battery

2149
02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:28.600
trader.

2150
02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:32.970
Recent American widower who begins and anonymous sexual relationship with a

2151
02:01:32.971 --> 02:01:37.080
young Betroth,
Prezi and woman,
Marlon Brando,

2152
02:01:37.230 --> 02:01:40.700
Maria Shriver,
Schneider.
Who's Maria Schneider

2153
02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:47.720
still alive,
alive and kicking.
Nope.
Died.

2154
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:53.770
58 2011 in Patty died in [inaudible] 58 is not that old.

2155
02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:56.273
<v 5>Wow.</v>

2156
02:01:57.770 --> 02:01:58.551
<v 0>You know,
it's interesting.</v>

2157
02:01:58.551 --> 02:02:02.840
I was going to say that some movies like the godfather holds up perfect.

2158
02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:05.360
The Godfather could be in the movies today.

2159
02:02:05.570 --> 02:02:09.830
It would seem a little unusual because of the way it's Sorta filmed and framed

2160
02:02:09.831 --> 02:02:13.400
and the music in it and everything like that.
It would it be like,

2161
02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:16.970
it would stand out as being unusual,
but it would totally hold up.

2162
02:02:17.150 --> 02:02:18.830
But other movies from that era,

2163
02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:23.020
big movies that you really enjoyed from that era dog,
a French connection.

2164
02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:26.040
You want to shoot yourself.
It's really bad except for the

2165
02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:29.890
<v 1>why would he shakes everybody down,
Bob by doors.
Hey,
what the fuck is this?</v>

2166
02:02:29.891 --> 02:02:32.650
And it makes the milkshake.
Yeah,
that's all really good.

2167
02:02:32.651 --> 02:02:36.280
But everything else that mechanic drags and Charles Bronson movie want to shoot

2168
02:02:36.281 --> 02:02:40.960
yourself.
Really?
It's brutal.
Even hot high times holds up,

2169
02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:46.270
you know,
high mechanic at slow.
She tried to watch the Godfather.

2170
02:02:46.271 --> 02:02:51.160
I never watched any of them.
It's
slow.
The mechanic,

2171
02:02:51.161 --> 02:02:55.660
you got to have balls of steel.
Your wife,
no,
she's just don't look at jam.

2172
02:02:55.661 --> 02:02:58.150
Michael Vessel Thai for about 20 minutes.

2173
02:02:58.470 --> 02:03:00.940
But he's an example of a guy who fell apart.

2174
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:05.870
America doesn't know the beauty of a man because member of Jab,
Michael Vincent,

2175
02:03:05.871 --> 02:03:06.704
it kept it together.

2176
02:03:06.910 --> 02:03:10.750
Richard Gere would've still been jumping down with fucking Hindus and fucking

2177
02:03:10.751 --> 02:03:13.780
Baghdad or wherever the fuck he was.
He's a Buddhist,
Richard Gere.
Big Time.

2178
02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:17.590
There would've been no Richard Gere cause he was blind.
He was about to kill it.

2179
02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:19.840
He killed it with the world's greatest athlete.

2180
02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:21.640
Maybe when we were kids and Disney,

2181
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:24.520
he picked up the fucking weights and his army stayed there and shit.

2182
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:29.770
He was that he played.
Uh,
but that was all,
he played a movie called defiance,

2183
02:03:30.250 --> 02:03:35.250
where he's a longshoreman on the west side with Paulie walnuts and the Sopranos.

2184
02:03:35.650 --> 02:03:40.270
Danny Aiello.
And they attack a fucking,
uh,
a gang,

2185
02:03:40.330 --> 02:03:44.680
like a Mexican Puerto Rican gang.
That movie was on HBO for a while,

2186
02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:49.540
but that movie,
that mechanic is slow as fuck.
Then they go to elite.

2187
02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:52.120
That slow as fuck through when they go to Italy.

2188
02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:54.970
<v 0>He was born in Denver,
Colorado,
and he's still alive.</v>

2189
02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:58.600
Jan Michael Vincent is still alive.
That's amazing.
69 years old.

2190
02:03:59.770 --> 02:04:03.610
No fucking kidneys.
Your liver.
That motherfuckers just knit crazy though.

2191
02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:06.880
Last tango in Paris.
Chick Dennis.
Fuck Sham.

2192
02:04:06.881 --> 02:04:11.200
Mako Vincent pickled drunk as shit though.
Teeth they'll kick in.

2193
02:04:12.370 --> 02:04:17.170
Yeah,
man.
He's fucking,
apparently he's got some issues too.

2194
02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:23.030
He left Hollywood 12 years ago for a life on the Mississippi Delta.

2195
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:26.960
That's where he lives now.
God's gotta be a weird ride,
man.

2196
02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:30.530
Not Everybody's cut out for that kind of movie star Tom Cruise Type Shit.

2197
02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:34.190
It's crazy as that Tom Cruise motherfucker is,
keeps it together.

2198
02:04:34.191 --> 02:04:38.130
Pretty God damn good.
I mean,
I'm sure if you talked to one of his ex wives,

2199
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:41.280
they would say,
Ooh,
that would tell you some horror story.

2200
02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:44.920
What people and fucking crazy outfits,
you know,

2201
02:04:44.921 --> 02:04:48.980
tell him about Xenu up on the planet.
Pluton or some shit.

2202
02:04:48.981 --> 02:04:51.270
It's controlling Tom's vibrations.

2203
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:54.240
Forcing him to recite the doctrine of Scientology.

2204
02:04:54.241 --> 02:04:58.320
But if you look at it like what he's done and the fact that he's still alive and

2205
02:04:58.321 --> 02:05:01.800
kicking from,
go back to like,
what was that first movie?
Uh,

2206
02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:04.290
just take those old records.
Ah,
Shit.

2207
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:09.310
What movie was that risky business go from risky business to today in 2000 and

2208
02:05:10.171 --> 02:05:15.171
fucking 14 Tom Cruise is still knocking it out of the park as a movie star.

2209
02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:17.710
You know why Gyro Scientology?
No,

2210
02:05:18.650 --> 02:05:23.400
<v 1>just decide side tachy he's as well prepared as you are his gaze on top of his</v>

2211
02:05:23.401 --> 02:05:24.234
game.

2212
02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:27.960
You know that you can't be fucking around and getting 20 million of move you

2213
02:05:27.961 --> 02:05:30.810
fucking around.
He's on top of his game.
You know what bro?

2214
02:05:30.811 --> 02:05:35.160
He's got some movies that you watch them and go,
yeah,
this sucks,
but gold.
Yeah.

2215
02:05:35.190 --> 02:05:38.440
He went from risky business and all of a sudden he rocked,

2216
02:05:38.441 --> 02:05:41.940
I guess Jack Nicholson of that movie with the marine movie.

2217
02:05:41.941 --> 02:05:44.830
What's the name of that fucking movie?
Oh yeah.
If you could meet whatever.

2218
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:49.320
He rocked her that and then he rocked this fucking Jerry Maguire.
I mean,

2219
02:05:49.321 --> 02:05:52.650
he hit it out of the fucking park as an agent.
But dog,

2220
02:05:52.651 --> 02:05:57.090
when you watch that fucking movie where he plays the Hitman with Jamie Foxx.

2221
02:05:57.300 --> 02:05:59.490
Oh yeah.
He goes into the Japanese bar.

2222
02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:03.810
It was Korea town and he starts shooting motherfuckers looking at his legs,

2223
02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:07.770
but he shoots,
that's the middle of stairs.
That's military style shooting.

2224
02:06:07.771 --> 02:06:09.870
And you just don't make that up.
You,
you're a scientologist.

2225
02:06:10.290 --> 02:06:12.690
So that means for three weeks before that,
he went and worked somewhere.

2226
02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:17.310
He was beautiful.
That movie.
He was beautiful.
And that scene at all

2227
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:20.880
<v 0>guys who've ever done those movies,
he's the most consistent.</v>

2228
02:06:21.110 --> 02:06:23.020
Like he does his own stunts is on race,

2229
02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:26.570
<v 1>rolling stones,
all that shit.
And you know what?
I'm [inaudible] at tight.</v>

2230
02:06:26.571 --> 02:06:30.980
He's a tiny dude.
Ricky Cruz play this double,
uh,

2231
02:06:31.010 --> 02:06:35.660
the movie where he said that was horrendously bad Santa movie.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Oh,

2232
02:06:35.661 --> 02:06:40.310
the sunset strip.
When we played a Rockstar,
Alec Baldwin and all those people

2233
02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:44.960
I heard that was a hunk of shit.
Oh,

2234
02:06:44.961 --> 02:06:49.830
they said it was the kiss at that Ricky cruise played his double is a standard.

2235
02:06:51.130 --> 02:06:55.180
<v 0>[inaudible] he's not,
I heard it's an exaggeration,
but it's not that tiny.</v>

2236
02:06:55.330 --> 02:06:59.160
<v 6>I heard that they actually build sets where it's bigger so he can stand on site.</v>

2237
02:06:59.350 --> 02:07:00.280
Whoever he with it.

2238
02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:03.350
<v 0>Well they did that with him and Brad Pitt when him and Brad Pitt did interview</v>

2239
02:07:03.351 --> 02:07:03.921
with the vampire.

2240
02:07:03.921 --> 02:07:07.190
Brad Pitt talked about how they would walk and Tom Cruise would walk next to him

2241
02:07:07.191 --> 02:07:08.270
on like a ramp.

2242
02:07:08.690 --> 02:07:12.350
So like Brad Pitt would walk here and Tom Cruise would walk next to him on a

2243
02:07:12.351 --> 02:07:15.230
ramp because he had to be the same height as him.

2244
02:07:15.550 --> 02:07:17.170
<v 6>I bet they do that for a lot of movies though.</v>

2245
02:07:17.171 --> 02:07:20.380
Cause they have these leads that he like the actresses,

2246
02:07:20.381 --> 02:07:22.990
they can't have the actress be taller than him.
So,
oh

2247
02:07:23.450 --> 02:07:25.360
<v 0>that's weird.
It's weird.</v>

2248
02:07:25.670 --> 02:07:30.110
It's weird that that hasn't like it's hampered him,
you know,

2249
02:07:30.111 --> 02:07:34.100
in any way.
He's still like one of the main movie stars.
He rocks the house,

2250
02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:37.000
rocks the house.
He rocked house and this,
I'm telling you,
Joey,
go see this guy.

2251
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.863
Yeah,

2252
02:07:38.630 --> 02:07:41.120
<v 1>you don't have to solve it.
But there's some people we love this,
the,</v>

2253
02:07:41.121 --> 02:07:43.410
a lot of the capitol,
and this helped me in that.

2254
02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:47.510
That's another got to give a big envelope too.
He's crazy.
He's crazy.
Does it?

2255
02:07:47.511 --> 02:07:51.050
He does it to get that big envelope he's got,
yeah,
he's going to do dog shirts,

2256
02:07:51.051 --> 02:07:52.610
Bro.
You can't control that.

2257
02:07:52.611 --> 02:07:57.350
Ca calls him guess while we have a movie about a bar,
you're going to be great.

2258
02:07:57.351 --> 02:07:58.610
And next thing you know he's tap dancing.

2259
02:07:59.270 --> 02:08:00.710
I'm sure why they giving them envelopes.

2260
02:08:00.711 --> 02:08:03.320
It's okay after he goes to the fucking screen.
Five,

2261
02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:07.380
<v 0>see he's five,
seven and ving.
Rhames is actually six foot,</v>

2262
02:08:07.381 --> 02:08:10.050
but this isn't a good example where they're trying to make him look.

2263
02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:12.210
I don't think he's five seven.
I think that's a lie.

2264
02:08:12.900 --> 02:08:15.450
I think that's one of those Napoleon things.
You know,

2265
02:08:15.451 --> 02:08:17.160
everybody talks about Napoleon being short.

2266
02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:20.850
You know the Polian was like above average height for the time.
It wasn't short.

2267
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:21.990
It was England fucking with them.

2268
02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:25.020
They would do all these jokes about Napoleon being short.
He was five,

2269
02:08:25.021 --> 02:08:28.200
six back then people were tiny shit.
So like five,

2270
02:08:28.201 --> 02:08:31.110
six back then was like a normal size dude.

2271
02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:34.950
Is this the same website you keep pulling up college humor?

2272
02:08:34.951 --> 02:08:36.180
I don't know if they substantiated that.

2273
02:08:36.181 --> 02:08:38.010
All the other websites also said five seven

2274
02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:43.030
five seven here's the key.
Here's the point when time couriers.
Yup.

2275
02:08:43.110 --> 02:08:47.670
Five seven Diaz is five seven see how they're making him like they're

2276
02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:49.080
constantly,
always make him tell her,

2277
02:08:49.081 --> 02:08:51.610
even though these people are way taller than him.
Oh,

2278
02:08:51.630 --> 02:08:56.110
so he's standing on something.
Yeah,
like buckets and stuff.
Yeah.
It says a,

2279
02:08:56.430 --> 02:08:58.200
wouldn't it be funny if he's actually six feet tall,

2280
02:08:58.201 --> 02:09:02.040
but this is just a giant troll that everybody's saying.
He's five seven,
five,

2281
02:09:02.041 --> 02:09:05.400
seven,
five,
seven.
Yeah.
Oh,
he's walking next to people.
Well,

2282
02:09:05.401 --> 02:09:08.190
Katie Holmes was giant.
Like where they would go out in public.

2283
02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:12.210
Katie Holmes was like legitimately like five 10 right?
Wasn't she?
No,

2284
02:09:12.211 --> 02:09:17.100
I think she's Kinda young girl or girl.
Oh,
she is?
She's five.

2285
02:09:17.101 --> 02:09:21.630
Nine.
Yeah,
but so it was Nicole Kidman.
Nicole.
Kim was big too.

2286
02:09:21.730 --> 02:09:23.040
I'll say what's going on there?
He's,
yeah.

2287
02:09:23.130 --> 02:09:25.380
He's not doing it to got some shit in his shoes.
Well,

2288
02:09:25.381 --> 02:09:28.360
there's dudes who were stuff in their shoes,
you know,
and she's got,

2289
02:09:28.430 --> 02:09:33.040
Raj is big too,
right?
Yeah.
Maybe we Rogers Rogers,
he slept some deck though.

2290
02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:37.020
Maybe he did.
Maybe,
you know,
whatever he did,

2291
02:09:37.021 --> 02:09:41.070
he figured out how to get all these girls to marry him.
This,
you know what,

2292
02:09:41.071 --> 02:09:46.071
we'll never get the full story because Scientology is so secretive and inclusive

2293
02:09:46.141 --> 02:09:50.700
and you know,
so,
so culty but what a fascinating story that would be,

2294
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:53.790
let's see,
like if,
if,
I mean if the rumors are all true,

2295
02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.290
if he really is a closeted gay guy that has arranged marriages and they go on

2296
02:09:58.291 --> 02:10:01.820
for 10 years and the women get all this money and you know,

2297
02:10:01.830 --> 02:10:04.660
he needs them because this is like the image that he's trying to,

2298
02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:07.040
to portray that.
It's a fascinating story.
I've

2299
02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:07.873
<v 1>explained to them,</v>

2300
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:10.430
cause I was thinking about it and look at what happened with Donald Sterling.

2301
02:10:11.450 --> 02:10:14.600
How would he meetings,
could you go to and say to yourself,

2302
02:10:14.630 --> 02:10:19.630
I can make a fucking kill me if I could get my phone to take a meeting of,

2303
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:23.120
you know,
seeing like a Scientology party would.
It really is.

2304
02:10:23.610 --> 02:10:28.610
It's like a vault and fucking Tom cruise jumper up on some guys working on it

2305
02:10:29.851 --> 02:10:33.310
was somebody would sell that for hundred million dollars.
That's one a though.

2306
02:10:33.470 --> 02:10:33.980
Well,
you know,
you're

2307
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:37.670
<v 0>seeing that now with certain guys like this Brian Singer guy that directs the x</v>

2308
02:10:37.671 --> 02:10:42.120
men that this is the guy that is in trouble because one of his ex boyfriends is

2309
02:10:42.410 --> 02:10:44.930
claiming that he was sexually exploited and they pass them around.

2310
02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:49.370
If you paid attention to this,
Holy Shit.
They have fucking parties.

2311
02:10:49.371 --> 02:10:52.970
Let me tell you something.
No hate gay motherfuckers know how to partner.

2312
02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:56.990
They know how to party.
These guys have this fucking day as photos.

2313
02:10:56.991 --> 02:10:58.820
Pull up some photos of Brian Singer's parties.

2314
02:10:59.210 --> 02:11:02.660
He has parties where he has a red lights in the swimming pool and they were

2315
02:11:02.661 --> 02:11:03.830
filled with twinks.

2316
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:09.290
It's a twink soup and everyone is dancing around the pool.
The pool is,

2317
02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:13.250
it's flooded by guys with no shirts on and they're all touching each other and

2318
02:11:13.251 --> 02:11:16.820
having a great fucking time.
And if you're gay that God,
that's gotta be the way.

2319
02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:21.410
Look at this.
That's the way to fucking party.
Why not?
What is everybody angry at?

2320
02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:25.460
What's Twix twinks twinks or like little skinny gay guys that look,
you know,

2321
02:11:25.461 --> 02:11:27.950
kind of like boyish.
That's,
that's a type,
yeah,

2322
02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:31.820
super twink and he just gives a super twain,
but like,
look at this.

2323
02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:35.270
What is wrong with this?
This looks like a super positive scene to me.

2324
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:37.940
I don't have any problem with anything I see here.

2325
02:11:37.941 --> 02:11:41.300
I see a bunch of guys doing what they want to do their pants off.

2326
02:11:41.301 --> 02:11:45.620
They're hanging around in a pool.
Who gives a shit?
The water brown.
No,
that's

2327
02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:51.320
from all that ass to go light blue lives.

2328
02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:54.560
Don't do it as a light in the pool lights.
You've seen the corner,

2329
02:11:54.561 --> 02:11:56.750
you see the red light.
It's obvious there's lights.

2330
02:11:57.300 --> 02:12:01.100
Is it red light bulbs with the guy,
Bryan singer.
He's been around for a while.

2331
02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:05.360
Yeah.
What kind of movies directed before?
Right.
Directed a lot of movies.

2332
02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:09.140
Like what?
Like x men did a lot of extra time two years ago.

2333
02:12:09.141 --> 02:12:12.020
Right now he's done it.
I think he's got quite a few of them right?
It hasn't he,

2334
02:12:12.050 --> 02:12:12.980
he's done a bunch of shit.

2335
02:12:12.981 --> 02:12:17.981
Let's do Brian saying let's pull it up like that one guy that was suing because

2336
02:12:17.991 --> 02:12:18.520
he's getting me,

2337
02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:21.060
cause he was like the guy that got passed around by all the guys.

2338
02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:23.750
But you know what man,
here's the deal.

2339
02:12:24.170 --> 02:12:27.140
If you show up for one of those things and you got passed around,
you're like,

2340
02:12:27.141 --> 02:12:29.750
what the hell?
I gotta get Outta here.
This is a bad situation.

2341
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:32.600
If you keep showing up and you keep getting passed around and then you want to

2342
02:12:32.601 --> 02:12:37.220
write a book about it,
you could have left.
I know what time it is.

2343
02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:41.550
You got a coast Costar Pot.
You got fucked in the ass 82 times.
That's it.

2344
02:12:41.551 --> 02:12:44.030
That's it.
Listen,
I could see that happening in Hollywood.

2345
02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:47.630
It happens to women all the time,
guys.
They go to these fucking parties.

2346
02:12:47.631 --> 02:12:49.760
I don't know what type of parties there are next to the other.

2347
02:12:49.761 --> 02:12:52.390
In the Hollywood hills that do with fucking Ruffino.

2348
02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:55.400
They're doing blow and there's eight fucking young guys.
Fucking,

2349
02:12:55.401 --> 02:12:58.880
it happens kind of.
I've been to one.
No,
it happens.

2350
02:12:58.940 --> 02:13:01.910
It has to happen with little young guys for the confused here.

2351
02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:05.450
They come from a small town that gay,
they go to an audition,

2352
02:13:06.020 --> 02:13:09.650
Bryan singer contacts about what the 12th you personally,
you know,

2353
02:13:09.651 --> 02:13:14.180
let's do lunch.
Next thing you know,
you read a fucking pool and let's go.

2354
02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:16.700
Let's go upstairs.
Probably can't even believe it.
You know,

2355
02:13:16.701 --> 02:13:18.500
you watch that movie with Tom Cruise,

2356
02:13:18.770 --> 02:13:22.430
one of the darkest movies he made great movie.

2357
02:13:22.580 --> 02:13:24.800
Which movie you want without the masks.

2358
02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:30.380
That's always on late night.
Why Saint Bryan singer?

2359
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:31.980
Because W I compare

2360
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.190
<v 1>that situation to like that.
Yeah,
that Stanley Kubrick,</v>

2361
02:13:35.191 --> 02:13:38.580
but we're a bunch of old guys.
They're fucking,

2362
02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:41.520
once a month they go to a house.

2363
02:13:41.730 --> 02:13:44.910
Red Band tells me to call a phone and say red devil.

2364
02:13:45.180 --> 02:13:47.670
And He sends you to a house and it was a car picks you up.

2365
02:13:47.671 --> 02:13:50.070
You don't even know where you're going,
how fucking creepy.

2366
02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:55.400
And they take it to a house and there's a fucking hundred tenge walking around

2367
02:13:55.651 --> 02:14:00.510
with mascot naked,
naked.
And you're doing the sacrilegious shit with drums,

2368
02:14:00.511 --> 02:14:01.350
with a robot,

2369
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:05.220
which means you're going to fuck somebody in the ass till they die then.

2370
02:14:05.260 --> 02:14:08.910
But Tom Cruise was fucking a chick and she was on coke and she took her in.

2371
02:14:08.911 --> 02:14:11.790
The doctor was Sydney Pollack.
Nobody fucking remembers here.

2372
02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:14.340
What do you remember that movie at all?
That's a fucking dark man.

2373
02:14:14.341 --> 02:14:18.570
What happened bro?
What happens is the coke Kidman fucks with him.

2374
02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:19.391
Let me tell you some,

2375
02:14:19.391 --> 02:14:23.520
I never thought Nicole came and was shit that I watched that movie the coke him

2376
02:14:23.521 --> 02:14:26.340
and eat him up and spits them alive.
Like with this accent.

2377
02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:31.230
She starts to tell him about it once was a time where I went to this thing with

2378
02:14:31.231 --> 02:14:34.980
this army guy and he,
he,
he,
you were in a man,

2379
02:14:34.981 --> 02:14:36.900
like he starts telling him he wasn't a man,

2380
02:14:37.290 --> 02:14:40.890
but that she went in this guy that got a navy guy.

2381
02:14:41.220 --> 02:14:42.680
So he got so mad,

2382
02:14:42.690 --> 02:14:46.740
he started getting a cab and he kept seeing spots of this fucking guy just

2383
02:14:46.741 --> 02:14:48.030
rammed with Nicole Kidman,

2384
02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:51.630
black and white footage in your head of this guy with a navy hat.

2385
02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:56.370
Just blasted it.
And finally he goes to get a hooker.
She's missing something.

2386
02:14:56.371 --> 02:14:59.490
So he goes into an Arabian,
this dude to get a,

2387
02:14:59.550 --> 02:15:03.080
because he goes to see his buddy who was the piano play and the guy goes,
no,
no,

2388
02:15:03.081 --> 02:15:06.990
no,
I gotta,
I got a Gig I can't tell you about.
He tells me about the Gig.
He goes,

2389
02:15:06.991 --> 02:15:08.670
you got to wear a cape and a top hat.

2390
02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:13.620
So this dude has to go to a fucking costume store at midnight,
wakes up the guy.

2391
02:15:13.980 --> 02:15:16.920
But when he wakes up the guy to rent the costume,

2392
02:15:16.921 --> 02:15:19.860
they hear something and they go in the room and the guy,

2393
02:15:19.861 --> 02:15:24.240
that costume guy has a daughter who's 15 and she's getting fucked by two

2394
02:15:24.241 --> 02:15:28.470
Japanese guys,
wear wigs and Mascara on and pink shit on their faces.

2395
02:15:28.710 --> 02:15:30.210
This is darker than fuck.

2396
02:15:30.510 --> 02:15:33.420
And Tom Cruise walks in the middle of this and pop them on off.
So he's like,

2397
02:15:33.421 --> 02:15:36.360
what the fuck's going on?
And he takes a cab to this place.

2398
02:15:36.361 --> 02:15:40.110
It gives the cap 200 bucks and he walks in and he sees all these naked woman.

2399
02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:43.340
He tells him the code word and I mean it's fucking God.

2400
02:15:43.341 --> 02:15:45.060
He goes in there and Sydney Pollack.

2401
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:48.870
Then the next day he goes looking for the piano guy and the piano guys missing

2402
02:15:50.420 --> 02:15:53.700
God because they go up to Tom Cruise during the thing and they go,

2403
02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:56.940
we know who you are.
We're advise you to get that.
A lot of here.

2404
02:15:57.750 --> 02:16:00.330
The next set of piano play is gone done.

2405
02:16:00.331 --> 02:16:04.050
Finito he goes back to the costume store,
he returned to stuff.

2406
02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:06.050
One thing leads to another guy goes,
oh no,

2407
02:16:06.060 --> 02:16:10.650
you're missing the boat time and all of a sudden after all the yelling and

2408
02:16:10.651 --> 02:16:13.590
screaming,
when she caught the fucking guy with the Japanese guys,

2409
02:16:14.100 --> 02:16:17.310
the girl comes walking out of the back where the two Japanese guys wear business

2410
02:16:17.311 --> 02:16:21.710
suits on.
So he thinks he's going to fucking,
it's an awesome mindfuck.

2411
02:16:21.870 --> 02:16:25.600
If you could sit it out,
Stanley Kubrick was was a bad motherfucker.

2412
02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:27.390
That movie took like three years to release.

2413
02:16:27.570 --> 02:16:30.010
There was something about movie Kubrick was

2414
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:31.490
<v 4>dying,
but Nicole Kidman,</v>

2415
02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:36.600
it wears a pair of regular panties with a wife beater with those little teddies

2416
02:16:37.421 --> 02:16:38.254
dog.

2417
02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:42.010
When I mean with little teddies turning you on when those two little beavers are

2418
02:16:42.011 --> 02:16:44.800
up and she's calling them like a fucking faggot through his face,
he's like,

2419
02:16:44.801 --> 02:16:45.700
you're a fucking faggot.

2420
02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:50.080
I dream of this navy guy fucking taking me down and breathing on my neck.

2421
02:16:50.081 --> 02:16:54.220
I could smell his breath and he's like breaking inside and it goes really well.

2422
02:16:54.221 --> 02:16:56.590
I'm going to go out and slate some days.
He's a doctor in the movie.

2423
02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:02.300
There she is right there.
Look it up.
Little teddies that say,

2424
02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:05.350
get up and fucking come on these little fucking milk duds.

2425
02:17:05.351 --> 02:17:07.540
Look up with that fucking hat.

2426
02:17:07.541 --> 02:17:11.250
Bumped up your pull up behind the fucking I get dragged her into the yellow.

2427
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:14.680
Look it up.
Look at that little random fucking with Australian little monkey.

2428
02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:19.330
It's mostly like an alligator
fucking savage between her legs.

2429
02:17:19.331 --> 02:17:21.220
Look at that.
Look at those little bony hips.

2430
02:17:21.221 --> 02:17:24.430
You know how good they fucked when I'm stuck in that fucking monster.

2431
02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:29.490
Well those hips up popping up.
Forget about Wednesday,
11 o'clock.

2432
02:17:29.530 --> 02:17:32.860
That check is bagging.
I need to get that on my iPad tonight.

2433
02:17:34.050 --> 02:17:34.883
That's why I shot.

2434
02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:39.510
I probably need to rewatch cause I remember I didn't like it the first time I

2435
02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:41.710
watched it.

2436
02:17:41.710 --> 02:17:45.340
But every woman in that and that scene and then he does blow with the check or

2437
02:17:45.341 --> 02:17:49.280
she knows blow you Britton and Stanley.
That motherfuckers crazy.

2438
02:17:49.281 --> 02:17:53.560
He said they Apollo.
You know,
he was like she's dead or some shit or whatever.

2439
02:17:53.561 --> 02:17:55.780
I'm a doctor.
What's wrong with you?
You're losing it.

2440
02:17:55.920 --> 02:17:58.960
It didn't get a good good review.
No.
Cause it was Stanley.

2441
02:17:58.990 --> 02:18:01.470
You know it was dark dog.
They'd say what?

2442
02:18:01.490 --> 02:18:06.480
What a Stanley's other movies real quick.
2001 a space odyssey space,

2443
02:18:06.930 --> 02:18:10.420
but he's got another one that's crazy orange.
She's got it.
Yeah.

2444
02:18:10.421 --> 02:18:12.130
And they're all fucking fuck movies.

2445
02:18:12.510 --> 02:18:15.790
But what's another Stanley like an army movie that didn't have a dark.
Yeah,

2446
02:18:15.791 --> 02:18:20.440
full metal jacket.
That's a shit.
Okay.
That's fucking dark shit.

2447
02:18:20.470 --> 02:18:25.450
Brilliant.
What is it that,
that's a brilliant move.
Jelly donut Colbert pile.

2448
02:18:25.451 --> 02:18:29.140
You know that's the best army movie ever talked when he saw metal jacket.

2449
02:18:29.141 --> 02:18:32.470
Is there a better army movie?
Apocalypse now was up there too.
It's up there.

2450
02:18:32.590 --> 02:18:34.690
It's up there.
But I think full metal jackets better.

2451
02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:38.140
I think it might be better efficient bro.
It's right up their platoon.

2452
02:18:38.170 --> 02:18:42.010
That's up their tents up there too.
But I'm saving private.
Ryan is up there too.

2453
02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:44.960
That opening scene,
man,
fucking hit that beat.

2454
02:18:45.070 --> 02:18:48.580
That is as real as a fucking war scene gets.

2455
02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:52.620
There's no heart was beating up a fucking store and that fucking,

2456
02:18:52.621 --> 02:18:54.760
you know movie isn't bad when I watch it.

2457
02:18:54.761 --> 02:18:59.140
What's the one with down whatever Black Hawk down.
Never saw it.
That's great.

2458
02:18:59.141 --> 02:19:03.940
Maybe you've never seen Black Hawk down.
Don't tell me it's not.
Listen Bro.
To me,

2459
02:19:03.941 --> 02:19:08.800
that fucking opening scene with Martin Sheen and apocalypse now and what he's

2460
02:19:08.801 --> 02:19:12.200
directing it and he's like,
I'm waiting for a minute that I've been gone.

2461
02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:14.540
I went to see that movie on double barrel,

2462
02:19:14.541 --> 02:19:19.300
so I just tried acid with John Crowley,
dd Conterra and current dealer ran.

2463
02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:23.260
So we were out there waiting to go in and there was a Carvel and next to the

2464
02:19:23.261 --> 02:19:24.760
place,
I'll never forget this,
Joe Rogan.

2465
02:19:25.150 --> 02:19:28.360
I was tripping my balls off and there was a Carvel.

2466
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:31.130
<v 1>Next is movie theater.
There was a,
it was the second,</v>

2467
02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:35.180
it was a midnight showing an apocalypse now.
Yeah,
just come out on Friday.

2468
02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:39.200
It was a bin night.
We were in high school.
It's midnight on double barrel,

2469
02:19:39.201 --> 02:19:43.490
sunshine acid burden burden.
When your eyes a burden,

2470
02:19:43.790 --> 02:19:46.170
you're seeing shit and we'll wait.
Now lie,

2471
02:19:46.180 --> 02:19:49.160
there's an ice cream cone that's tipped over that somebody went to the movie

2472
02:19:49.161 --> 02:19:53.720
theater and tip it over and on it and my friend John Crowley picked it up and

2473
02:19:53.730 --> 02:19:54.230
study.

2474
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:57.500
I thought I was going to fucking die and they were waiting for the midnight

2475
02:19:57.501 --> 02:19:59.000
showing it's 16 years old,

2476
02:19:59.001 --> 02:20:01.820
whatever the fuck I was and watched apocalypse now and acid.

2477
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:04.520
I thought it was going to fucking die and go to that scene where they start

2478
02:20:04.521 --> 02:20:08.360
shooting arrows at them out of the fucking world and that's not the movie.

2479
02:20:08.361 --> 02:20:12.500
I don't sleep on that and forget the redux.
I liked the reduction.

2480
02:20:12.540 --> 02:20:14.990
They show up in France and eat with the people.
That's okay,

2481
02:20:15.380 --> 02:20:17.930
but it takes you away from the fucking path.

2482
02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:20.990
I liked the what they released because it's straight.

2483
02:20:21.270 --> 02:20:24.680
The redux is good for a little while.
The body is the French guy.

2484
02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:29.060
They all have dinner at that table,
but I really liked the fucking original.

2485
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:33.370
These are like the redux cause he's just got some added extra,
I don't want it.

2486
02:20:33.380 --> 02:20:35.720
It's three and a half hours.
I got that little extra something.

2487
02:20:35.721 --> 02:20:37.250
It's not what you need though.
It's not what you need.

2488
02:20:37.251 --> 02:20:40.100
That movie had they cut that movie a certain fucking away.

2489
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:42.860
The movie was creepy Bro.
It was creepy.

2490
02:20:42.861 --> 02:20:46.100
There was parts of that movie where you feel creaked the fuck out.

2491
02:20:46.101 --> 02:20:47.830
You know what else I saw a couple of weeks ago that you haven't,

2492
02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:51.770
Saint Joe Rogan midnight express great fucking movie when he bites that

2493
02:20:51.771 --> 02:20:55.190
motherfucker's tongues out your shit and he's standing there and he's covered in

2494
02:20:55.191 --> 02:20:58.070
fucking blood and the Oh fucking tremendous.

2495
02:20:58.380 --> 02:21:02.000
I think just that was the first time I ever saw a movie where a guy got arrested

2496
02:21:02.001 --> 02:21:05.360
in another country and I was like,
Oh,
don't get arrested in another country,

2497
02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:07.300
especially for drugs.
Oh my God.

2498
02:21:07.310 --> 02:21:10.430
When they took his clothes down and he had the envelope stuck to his body,

2499
02:21:11.420 --> 02:21:16.050
you feel it.
Your heart's beating because the director
Tony,

2500
02:21:16.060 --> 02:21:17.660
he's got his hands up and I was of like,
oh.

2501
02:21:17.950 --> 02:21:21.470
And he's got the guns all around them and they take them in and they don't pip

2502
02:21:21.471 --> 02:21:24.070
the deep.
Yeah,
somebody fuck that.
He became game.
That became,

2503
02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:27.500
it became [inaudible] and then that's where the guy kept fucking with them and

2504
02:21:27.501 --> 02:21:32.150
the guy hung has Fred's cat.
And once he woke up and seen the cat hanging,

2505
02:21:32.480 --> 02:21:36.860
the guy went nuts because you try just for fucked up to on sellers hash and he

2506
02:21:36.861 --> 02:21:39.740
just starts beat.
That's one of the greatest beats of all time.

2507
02:21:39.980 --> 02:21:43.250
Maybe he's kicking them.
The guys under the sink crawling.
He's bleeding,

2508
02:21:43.251 --> 02:21:46.030
he's begging for his life and he's just fucking loser.

2509
02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:50.060
He's been in this fucking foreign country.
He's been lied to.
They gave 80 years.

2510
02:21:50.061 --> 02:21:52.460
You're dying and I'm dying to,
and he's kicking.

2511
02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:56.260
He's kicking checkup and finally got claws out.
He's got like one I left.

2512
02:21:56.270 --> 02:22:00.720
He fucking grabs him and he fucked.
Cause he's a rat.
He fucking mugs upset.

2513
02:22:00.770 --> 02:22:02.330
He takes his fucking company,

2514
02:22:02.331 --> 02:22:06.080
bites it out and they show the scene with his fucking tongue of this month.

2515
02:22:06.081 --> 02:22:10.580
The Guy fucking fall and that guy died.
He died of AIDS in real life.

2516
02:22:10.581 --> 02:22:13.100
They got to emulate him.
The guy is brilliant.

2517
02:22:13.101 --> 02:22:16.610
He just sits there and you could see the rage.
You could feel it,
bro.

2518
02:22:16.611 --> 02:22:19.430
I would go crazy if I was the fucking web of jail.

2519
02:22:19.431 --> 02:22:22.280
They had you and now you don't understand the language.

2520
02:22:22.430 --> 02:22:26.090
Some guys selling you water down fucking t he rats on yet

2521
02:22:26.090 --> 02:22:29.550
<v 4>and now he killed your friend's cat,
Bro.
He throws a beaten on that guy,</v>

2522
02:22:29.551 --> 02:22:33.480
hit him with the pots,
the pans,
and by the time he comes off from the other side,

2523
02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:35.650
he's missing an eye and he fucking grabs them.

2524
02:22:35.651 --> 02:22:39.570
Just mites is fucking fuck off of being a rat.
Good googly Mowgli.

2525
02:22:40.140 --> 02:22:44.320
I was in the fucking hate the seventh grade pro.
That's the movies I watch.

2526
02:22:44.340 --> 02:22:47.010
I'm going to fucking ECZEMA.
What are you talking about?
Me fucking movie.

2527
02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:50.490
Great Hex man.
That was a movie too.
That taught a lot of kids,

2528
02:22:50.491 --> 02:22:53.490
not the fucking smuggle drugs in the country because there's a lot of people

2529
02:22:53.491 --> 02:22:56.910
that watch that locked up abroad and they're like,
well,
the guys on TV now,

2530
02:22:56.940 --> 02:22:58.680
I guess he got away with it.
Everything's fine.

2531
02:22:58.950 --> 02:23:02.250
Most people that got locked up abroad then didn't go so well.

2532
02:23:02.940 --> 02:23:05.220
That gave her some watch.
That show terrifying for the show.

2533
02:23:05.430 --> 02:23:07.440
I don't even go there.
You don't watch that show?
No.
No.

2534
02:23:07.470 --> 02:23:10.770
I don't even want to go to that mentally.
No,
I was never I,
they'll listen.

2535
02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:12.220
I don't leave volumes that bad.

2536
02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:15.840
I got to cross the border of Mexico trying to bring them over.
Once that happens,

2537
02:23:15.870 --> 02:23:20.670
you're gun.
What's Mexico is not nearly as bad crossing from Mexico into America.

2538
02:23:20.700 --> 02:23:24.240
That's nothing like that in Turkey.
My fears,
I don't leave.

2539
02:23:24.290 --> 02:23:26.700
We'll leave the country with drugs.
Well,
I do drugs.

2540
02:23:26.701 --> 02:23:28.230
I don't want to leave this country because I need them.

2541
02:23:28.650 --> 02:23:30.740
I don't want to get caught somewhere buying beat him.

2542
02:23:30.750 --> 02:23:33.650
I'm sure you want to smoke a joint and fucking Africa,
right?
Yeah.

2543
02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:38.220
And who knows what the laws are there?
What's the laws for weed and China?
Right?

2544
02:23:38.270 --> 02:23:40.500
The lock you up,
they'll give you 80 fucking ears.

2545
02:23:40.530 --> 02:23:43.250
What is already doing over there?
Staying clean.
She's,

2546
02:23:43.570 --> 02:23:47.850
I wonder what are you doing for weed?
Yeah.
Yes.
He's definitely staying clean.

2547
02:23:47.851 --> 02:23:51.480
Just a clean General Mao or whatever the fuck his name is.
Chairman.
Sure.

2548
02:23:52.020 --> 02:23:53.340
What did they give you for weed over there?

2549
02:23:53.341 --> 02:23:55.730
Like what type of shit they give you for wheat and China?
Well,

2550
02:23:55.740 --> 02:24:00.690
as far as like a sentence.
Yeah,
I'm not good.
It's very bad.
Come on.
Yeah.

2551
02:24:00.740 --> 02:24:02.160
Well we didn't.
China's very bad weed.

2552
02:24:02.161 --> 02:24:06.090
North Korea is legal and that word was weird.

2553
02:24:06.120 --> 02:24:08.100
No drugs bad.
In China,

2554
02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:13.160
they have all say the fucking listen to the mob stole the idea from the people

2555
02:24:14.911 --> 02:24:17.580
in China.
So I know this selling coke or something.

2556
02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:21.150
Not Everybody's going to jail for 80 years and Tryna let me pee real quick.

2557
02:24:21.210 --> 02:24:23.550
Drug laws in China,
let's look it up.
Illegal drugs

2558
02:24:23.610 --> 02:24:27.420
<v 0>trade in China.
It's a,
it's a pretty simple,</v>

2559
02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:33.210
China has one fifth of the world's population and a large expanding economy.

2560
02:24:33.390 --> 02:24:36.330
While OPM has played an important role in the country's history since the

2561
02:24:36.331 --> 02:24:38.400
beginning.
Oh,
since before.

2562
02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:40.430
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2563
02:24:40.430 --> 02:24:43.850
<v 0>Though the first and second opium wars,
the 19th century,</v>

2564
02:24:44.660 --> 02:24:47.660
China's large lab,
Matt,
loud,
large,
landmass,

2565
02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:52.430
cross close proximity to the Golden Triangle and numerous coastal cities with

2566
02:24:52.431 --> 02:24:57.431
large and modern port facilities make it an attractive transit center for drug

2567
02:24:58.611 --> 02:25:02.780
trafficking.
Hmm.
What is the fucking opium war?
Awesome.
Let's go.

2568
02:25:02.810 --> 02:25:05.900
Sounds like a good movie.
The first opium war.
Okay,

2569
02:25:05.901 --> 02:25:07.100
let's find out about the opium war.

2570
02:25:07.370 --> 02:25:12.370
Dan was in the 18 hundreds it was fought between Great Britain and China over

2571
02:25:12.951 --> 02:25:15.860
there.
Conflicting viewpoints on diplomatic relations,

2572
02:25:15.861 --> 02:25:20.030
trade and the administration of Justice for foreign nationals.

2573
02:25:20.031 --> 02:25:20.990
Prior to the conflict,

2574
02:25:20.991 --> 02:25:25.991
Chinese officials wished to end the spread of opium and confiscated around

2575
02:25:26.411 --> 02:25:28.270
20,000 chests of opium.

2576
02:25:28.271 --> 02:25:33.271
Approximately 1.2 million kilograms or two point whatever,

2577
02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:37.510
eight,
six,
6 million pounds from British traders.
The British government,

2578
02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:42.220
although not officially denying China's right to control inputs of the imports

2579
02:25:42.221 --> 02:25:43.054
of the drug,

2580
02:25:43.210 --> 02:25:48.210
objected to the seizure and use its military power to enforce violent redress.

2581
02:25:48.370 --> 02:25:53.170
So there's two,
two of them.
One of them was in a,
this,

2582
02:25:53.230 --> 02:25:56.110
the 18 hundreds there and another one was,
uh,

2583
02:25:56.440 --> 02:26:01.030
1856 to 1860.
There's two different opium wars.

2584
02:26:01.031 --> 02:26:01.864
Wow.

2585
02:26:02.470 --> 02:26:06.400
<v 1>We don't like it.
They give you,
they give you a lot.
A lot of time.
Let's say</v>

2586
02:26:07.140 --> 02:26:11.850
<v 0>seizures,
treaties and conventions.</v>

2587
02:26:11.851 --> 02:26:13.290
Drug laws,
agencies.

2588
02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:16.420
<v 1>Okay,
let's see.
Drug law enforcement.</v>

2589
02:26:18.970 --> 02:26:22.750
Yeah.
There's,
it's not good.
Don't do drugs in China.

2590
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:26.020
That's all I remember.
Um,
the Mickey work movie,

2591
02:26:26.021 --> 02:26:30.720
it's another fucking under underappreciated movie.
You're the Dragon Chavez.
13.

2592
02:26:30.780 --> 02:26:33.790
Any five dog.
That was a great fucking fuck who y'all go.

2593
02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:34.980
We won't make money with it.

2594
02:26:35.230 --> 02:26:39.280
But the story was about basically what's the Chinese said,
you know what bro?

2595
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:42.520
How long have you bought the fuck is going to be fucking list.
He is,

2596
02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:45.010
they can't catch us.
They never have.

2597
02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:48.400
You never read about the DEA busted the Chinese smuggling heroin.
Yeah.

2598
02:26:48.401 --> 02:26:52.200
Why is that really that really that they'd been doing it since the beginning of,

2599
02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:55.510
well,
they still doing it and trying it down.
I don't know.

2600
02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:57.570
I don't live there no more.
I heard it's a workout,

2601
02:26:57.571 --> 02:27:01.420
but I know when I was growing up,
the Chinese gave it to the black power guys.

2602
02:27:01.421 --> 02:27:03.010
The Chinese supplied the Jews,

2603
02:27:03.011 --> 02:27:07.180
the disciple of Chinese supplied all the major outlets.
They raped them.

2604
02:27:07.450 --> 02:27:08.560
They didn't give him that cut.

2605
02:27:09.010 --> 02:27:13.150
They pay them a percentage wholesale and then they went out cut at 18 times and

2606
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:16.180
a $30,000 investment.
He made a half a million dollars,
bro.

2607
02:27:16.730 --> 02:27:21.730
<v 0>Wasn't that a part of that movie with Denzel Washington where his,</v>

2608
02:27:21.951 --> 02:27:25.260
his friend was,
was it was,
yeah.
That's what it was.

2609
02:27:25.270 --> 02:27:27.650
Wasn't part of it was going to China and well he was taking,

2610
02:27:27.651 --> 02:27:30.150
he was bringing it in from Vietnam,
from Vietnam,

2611
02:27:31.210 --> 02:27:34.240
<v 1>Goit,
Liddy.
All those motherfuckers went on it.</v>

2612
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:37.530
All of those motherfuckers where you think they were doing and we think

2613
02:27:37.531 --> 02:27:40.330
everybody want to go to talk,
make tours of Vietnam.
They were making,

2614
02:27:40.420 --> 02:27:43.280
they were all over that fucking bringing in heroin in body bags pro.

2615
02:27:43.750 --> 02:27:47.050
The government do that.
That was the CIA and all those heavy duties.
Right.

2616
02:27:47.051 --> 02:27:49.900
That's what she going let he got in trouble.
Well,
you got trouble for Watergate,

2617
02:27:50.290 --> 02:27:53.100
but it's knowing that he was over there said that he is back.

2618
02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:54.170
<v 0>Shit,
wasn't it?
Well,</v>

2619
02:27:54.250 --> 02:27:57.220
there was so much money when you have so much money with what they,
the,

2620
02:27:57.221 --> 02:27:59.300
the amount of money in heroin in the Vietnam,

2621
02:27:59.340 --> 02:28:02.820
especially back then there was no Wikipedia,
no Edward Snowden,
no.

2622
02:28:02.821 --> 02:28:03.810
Julian Assan is,

2623
02:28:03.811 --> 02:28:07.020
you could hide shit pretty fucking easy and there was so much money to be made

2624
02:28:07.021 --> 02:28:09.150
in heroin.
Why wouldn't the government make it their,
their,

2625
02:28:09.151 --> 02:28:11.730
I think their idea was like,
look,
we'd be crazy.

2626
02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:14.160
Like someone's going to make this money and if they make the money,

2627
02:28:14.161 --> 02:28:17.100
they're going to control the resources that they get from that money.

2628
02:28:17.101 --> 02:28:20.310
They're going to be able to have influence and power and do things to people

2629
02:28:20.311 --> 02:28:22.580
with that money.
Fucking leg.
We'll just do it.
We'll do it the right way.

2630
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:25.220
And they just just started selling heroin.

2631
02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:27.620
They just started doing it the whole night.
I mean,

2632
02:28:27.621 --> 02:28:30.290
that was one of the main reasons why we had a hard time getting out of Vietnam.

2633
02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:33.830
The amount of money that was being generated.
Is that the truth?
Oh yeah.

2634
02:28:33.860 --> 02:28:35.870
Vietnam and heroin.
It's very well documented.

2635
02:28:35.871 --> 02:28:40.220
The Vietnam trade in heroin is a fascinating story because essentially repeating

2636
02:28:40.221 --> 02:28:43.190
itself in Afghanistan,
nobody,
everybody buries her head in the sand.

2637
02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:47.250
Nobody wants to admit it.
But the Afghanistan poppy trade,
like the,

2638
02:28:47.251 --> 02:28:52.251
the amount of heroin grown in Afghanistan is the huge percentage of the world's

2639
02:28:52.521 --> 02:28:57.170
heroin,
not just little bit of Afghanistan money,
the world.

2640
02:28:57.440 --> 02:29:01.250
Okay.
Let's,
let's look it up.
What do you guess percentage of heroin,

2641
02:29:01.280 --> 02:29:04.640
percentage of world heroin grown in Afghanistan?
Take a guess.

2642
02:29:04.641 --> 02:29:07.460
What would you think of this?
70%.
Okay.

2643
02:29:07.490 --> 02:29:12.140
Percentage of world's heroin in Afghanistan.
Um,
I'm gonna say 90.

2644
02:29:14.370 --> 02:29:15.880
<v 5>Let's see.
Okay,</v>

2645
02:29:16.860 --> 02:29:20.820
<v 0>shut up dude.
Okay,
let's,
it's fine.
It is to,
to,
to,</v>

2646
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:23.940
to opium production in Afghanistan,
Wikipedia,

2647
02:29:27.660 --> 02:29:31.620
uh,
amounts to export value of $4 billion.

2648
02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:36.720
Wow.
Holy Shit.
It's wholesale.
Correct?
Well,
I don't think your tax it

2649
02:29:37.310 --> 02:29:37.431
<v 1>well,</v>

2650
02:29:37.431 --> 02:29:42.431
that's wholesale selling it to me for it outs or a pal for whatever and be

2651
02:29:43.011 --> 02:29:47.750
cutting meat if it's 4 billion wholesale that they're,
the wholesale is,

2652
02:29:47.751 --> 02:29:50.690
they grow it,
they process it.
I come over and pick it up.

2653
02:29:51.480 --> 02:29:52.313
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2654
02:29:53.490 --> 02:29:57.900
<v 0>Um,
I don't know.
I don't know how they,
how they work.
It's just amazing.
Okay.</v>

2655
02:29:59.850 --> 02:30:00.683
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

2656
02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:05.090
<v 0>Well,
it's one thing is a fact.
It's,
I'm having a hard time find the numbers.
Well,</v>

2657
02:30:05.270 --> 02:30:07.040
one thing is the fact that it's gone up.

2658
02:30:07.340 --> 02:30:12.340
They're all saying that it hits record highs despite billions of dollars spent

2659
02:30:13.251 --> 02:30:16.550
to combat heroin trade,
Afghanistan,

2660
02:30:16.551 --> 02:30:18.350
opium production hits record highs.

2661
02:30:18.351 --> 02:30:23.351
This is a 2013 that the United States spent $7 billion to combat opium

2662
02:30:25.251 --> 02:30:28.070
production.
So they're there.
They're stealing from both sides.

2663
02:30:28.430 --> 02:30:32.300
They spent $7 billion and it went up.
It rose 36%.

2664
02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:36.710
Wow.
Oh my God.
That's hilarious.

2665
02:30:38.290 --> 02:30:42.940
60,000 US forces left Afghanistan down from a peak of $100,000.

2666
02:30:43.270 --> 02:30:45.820
So what they're saying is essentially,
no matter what they do,

2667
02:30:45.821 --> 02:30:49.010
the heroin production keeps going up and weird clerical.

2668
02:30:49.020 --> 02:30:53.670
<v 1>Who's the actor that just died?
Tragically?
Which one?
The guy,
Paul Walker.</v>

2669
02:30:54.140 --> 02:30:59.020
Uh,
no,
no,
no.
From heroin.
Phillips.
Oh,
from Maryland.
After Phillip Seymour Hoffman.

2670
02:30:59.040 --> 02:31:02.490
They went and they said,
boy,
heroines got to go down to this city.
You know,

2671
02:31:02.820 --> 02:31:04.470
some fucking crazy commissioner.

2672
02:31:04.850 --> 02:31:09.390
And he would put a cop and they got the guy that sold the bags out and then

2673
02:31:09.391 --> 02:31:12.930
probably he rolled on somebody and once he rolled on and somebody that fucking

2674
02:31:12.931 --> 02:31:17.670
cop got transferred Ethiopia and the,
that guy got fucking thrown and that's it.

2675
02:31:17.790 --> 02:31:20.670
They can't go you.
It's so fucking big.

2676
02:31:20.671 --> 02:31:24.690
The heroin trade and what a part of it,
somebody normal doesn't,

2677
02:31:25.440 --> 02:31:28.200
would say,
yeah,
we're going to fucking come back at it.
Really,

2678
02:31:29.130 --> 02:31:33.170
really fucking heroin prices have gone down 90% of the roads up yet.

2679
02:31:33.230 --> 02:31:33.770
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2680
02:31:33.770 --> 02:31:38.770
99% in 2000 it was 70 heroin is down to like,

2681
02:31:39.171 --> 02:31:41.500
you could buy $7 bags of heroin,
bro.

2682
02:31:42.060 --> 02:31:47.030
That's $7 $7 I could borrow $7 every fucking day,
guys.

2683
02:31:47.090 --> 02:31:51.860
$7 but just how crazy.
That's,
that's not,
but how crazy is it?
The one spot,

2684
02:31:52.370 --> 02:31:57.260
90% of the world's supply,
the world is 7 billion people.

2685
02:31:57.800 --> 02:32:00.710
How many people do heroin in the world?
The numbers have to be crazy.

2686
02:32:00.740 --> 02:32:03.560
When you had it and all these other countries,
not just America.

2687
02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:08.510
I didn't Mexico and Canada and everywhere.
The whole world.
Correct.

2688
02:32:08.810 --> 02:32:10.850
They processed everyone.
Everyone.
I don't believe so

2689
02:32:11.230 --> 02:32:15.700
<v 1>poppy from there,
they process it.
Mexico cause Mexican heroin is that black car.</v>

2690
02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:20.080
It's thick.
You've got to shoot it to shit that you buy in New York.

2691
02:32:20.110 --> 02:32:23.280
They have this white stuff.
You could snort it.
Oh really?
Uh,

2692
02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:27.590
and they tell you it's for a suburban.
Kids that don't like needles.
Oh.

2693
02:32:27.630 --> 02:32:29.230
Slash Norton that.
Listen Bro,

2694
02:32:29.410 --> 02:32:33.790
the heroin in New York is a sold to to Spanish people in Puerto Ricans in the

2695
02:32:33.791 --> 02:32:37.740
Bronx.
That black people,
that's what the New York trader's role,

2696
02:32:38.070 --> 02:32:39.610
the heroin that's sold in New York.

2697
02:32:39.940 --> 02:32:43.780
It's the fucking 20 year old yuppies that do a blast.
They do.

2698
02:32:43.781 --> 02:32:47.650
They don't shoot it.
They snorted.
That's what a big heroin is.
So yeah,

2699
02:32:47.651 --> 02:32:51.090
you still got the old geezers that are fucking shooting and they're fucking

2700
02:32:51.120 --> 02:32:55.900
wheel Seymour Hoffman shooting it.
I mean,
yeah.
He or she.
Have you tried this?

2701
02:32:55.901 --> 02:32:58.720
Snorting it?
What's the,
uh,
what do you feel?

2702
02:32:58.720 --> 02:33:01.000
How do you feel after I've never shot it.

2703
02:33:01.330 --> 02:33:05.560
I snorted it right the first time it was,
uh,

2704
02:33:05.580 --> 02:33:10.540
I got sick,
I got really pukey and I got sick,
but after I puked,

2705
02:33:10.541 --> 02:33:14.530
I felt better and I got really high and the first time I did it was like a pass

2706
02:33:14.531 --> 02:33:18.970
out type mode.
Like I,
I was thinking about stuff like,

2707
02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:22.750
I was thinking of my,
he was playing music and I was thinking about this stuff.

2708
02:33:23.290 --> 02:33:26.590
The second time I did,
I was locked up.
He did it in jail,

2709
02:33:26.650 --> 02:33:29.380
the jail and prison at that time I did it.
They came up with dudes,

2710
02:33:29.381 --> 02:33:33.110
but I don't know how to get in their visitation that,
ah,

2711
02:33:33.820 --> 02:33:38.640
you swap spit.
There was a,
my mouth hit the balloons.
I swap spit with you.
Whoa.

2712
02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:42.610
Not me.
I didn't smell it.
And this little girl,
a girl and my wife comes in,

2713
02:33:42.611 --> 02:33:46.900
it's you.
It's not worth it.
The the,
uh,
what that one was,

2714
02:33:46.901 --> 02:33:48.190
was black tar heroin.

2715
02:33:48.191 --> 02:33:51.350
And what the guy did was he cooked and he poured it in my loves of the Syringe,

2716
02:33:51.351 --> 02:33:52.270
but none of that wall,

2717
02:33:52.660 --> 02:33:53.740
<v 0>nothing happened,
didn't work.</v>

2718
02:33:54.270 --> 02:33:59.270
Then they're saying that 40% more poppies are grown in Mexico than marijuana.

2719
02:33:59.291 --> 02:34:03.580
Now they're growing more heroin,
40% more than marijuana.

2720
02:34:03.610 --> 02:34:07.960
The problem with the heroin,
the marijuana is that it's legal here,
essentially,

2721
02:34:08.260 --> 02:34:10.860
essentially illegal in California and California is right next door.

2722
02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.130
Forensic is a nice people,

2723
02:34:12.131 --> 02:34:15.040
but they can't compete with the fuck is going on in northern California.

2724
02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:17.980
They're very nice people.
It's California.

2725
02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:22.220
<v 4>We were there still people in parts of the country that spoke,
that Brown.
We,</v>

2726
02:34:22.221 --> 02:34:26.500
that goes to Connecticut,
that goes to Boston,
that goes to Minneapolis.

2727
02:34:26.770 --> 02:34:29.980
A lot of brown weed.
There's still a little traffic left in that Brown weed,

2728
02:34:30.340 --> 02:34:33.070
but for the most part,
don't take no fucking genius to know.

2729
02:34:33.071 --> 02:34:36.160
Listen than fucking yell at kids and Northern California,

2730
02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:39.730
they're about to fucking blow up.
The world is doing okay.

2731
02:34:40.090 --> 02:34:44.680
Even Amsterdam's like we can't compete on one dam's gone.
People go,
hey,

2732
02:34:44.681 --> 02:34:45.670
you ever go to Amsterdam?

2733
02:34:45.700 --> 02:34:50.260
Why the fuck would I go to Amsterdam but I can go to Denver gun?
It's all over.

2734
02:34:50.261 --> 02:34:52.030
Gentlemen.
Don't believe the hype.

2735
02:34:52.450 --> 02:34:55.990
They sh they closed all their stores like my store is done at the end of the

2736
02:34:55.990 --> 02:34:57.900
month.
The store next to us,
the end of the month.

2737
02:34:57.910 --> 02:35:00.470
What do you mean define wellness?
Went down a home.

2738
02:35:00.471 --> 02:35:03.580
My favorite spots or they just shut him down.

2739
02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:06.610
Now they went after the landlord ticket in north Hollywood.

2740
02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:08.530
Why would they do that?
Why would they do that?

2741
02:35:08.770 --> 02:35:13.090
They gotta pass it just to get it legal like it isn't Denver Denver's making so

2742
02:35:13.091 --> 02:35:16.060
much money.
Hand over fist.
They did a CNBC show about it.

2743
02:35:16.061 --> 02:35:17.360
You'll see the incredible,
oh boy.

2744
02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:20.310
There was a guy who was a weed pen company says in two years is companies going

2745
02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:25.300
to be worth $1 billion for a fucking weed?
Pens,
vape pens.

2746
02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:28.710
People buy a vape pens with no vape to put it.
Yeah,

2747
02:35:29.170 --> 02:35:33.420
just to have been Connecticut,
New York and when you can have some legal,

2748
02:35:33.490 --> 02:35:37.090
you get wax down and stuff like that.
You get wax,
you can grind the wheat up.

2749
02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:39.670
There's a lot of them.
Then you just grind the wheat up and you pack them,

2750
02:35:39.671 --> 02:35:41.340
but you've got to pack them.
Yeah,

2751
02:35:41.530 --> 02:35:44.020
like every two or three hits you've got to pay there.
Those are silly,

2752
02:35:44.650 --> 02:35:46.000
but they have them.

2753
02:35:46.030 --> 02:35:49.180
I like to see what would happen if they take the legal marijuana thing too,

2754
02:35:49.210 --> 02:35:52.290
Michigan and tried to see it.
You're not throw it in Detroit.
Yeah,

2755
02:35:52.410 --> 02:35:53.243
it's a good move.

2756
02:35:53.350 --> 02:35:56.860
But people would get high and then realize why the fuck are we standing in the

2757
02:35:56.861 --> 02:36:00.520
first two months ago,
the first two months go to the little kid rock's house.

2758
02:36:00.700 --> 02:36:03.490
People could be getting robbed on the way up.
Yes.

2759
02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:04.960
That's the probably going to happen.
Detroit,

2760
02:36:04.961 --> 02:36:08.380
they going to have to hide it too much security because you know,
it just,

2761
02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:12.190
it just see what people park their car and walk over and I seen it in Hollywood.

2762
02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:15.700
It was stories in Hollywood,
people robbing people outside of week stores.

2763
02:36:15.701 --> 02:36:16.210
You know,

2764
02:36:16.210 --> 02:36:18.790
now these weeds stores that are getting closed down there getting closed down by

2765
02:36:18.791 --> 02:36:21.510
the DEA,
like who's closing them down to the city,
the cities,

2766
02:36:21.590 --> 02:36:24.540
cities that the landlords are going,
we're going to find you every day.

2767
02:36:24.540 --> 02:36:27.400
So what a place I go.
You got to hire an attorney.

2768
02:36:28.450 --> 02:36:31.900
So for every day he stays open,
he's going to pay an attorney to keep them open.

2769
02:36:32.290 --> 02:36:35.920
And they just told me yesterday that the end of the June that done.
Why?

2770
02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:38.110
But there's still so many stores.
So what are the rules?

2771
02:36:38.111 --> 02:36:41.640
Were stores are allowed to be open and not open?
Is it like,
you know,

2772
02:36:41.710 --> 02:36:46.540
proximity to schools?
I know that divide.
Well,
this went down.

2773
02:36:47.140 --> 02:36:50.770
That was that they were the edible kings divine.
Well,
this and my eyes,

2774
02:36:51.190 --> 02:36:52.900
they always had something to kill.

2775
02:36:52.901 --> 02:36:57.100
A motherfucker that had the capsules that to Loris.
They had all the best shit.

2776
02:36:57.460 --> 02:37:01.900
And they told me they were moving to Canoga Park and there's new company came in

2777
02:37:02.110 --> 02:37:05.560
because they were moving because they were 500 feet from the church.

2778
02:37:05.860 --> 02:37:07.260
There's a church right on Lankershim.

2779
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:09.580
So divine wellness is moving in Canoga Park.

2780
02:37:09.581 --> 02:37:13.120
They moved to Canoga Park and then some other motherfucker gangsters came and

2781
02:37:13.121 --> 02:37:15.830
said,
fuck it,
you're going to have to shut us down.

2782
02:37:16.250 --> 02:37:17.150
<v 1>I think as the lay low,</v>

2783
02:37:17.151 --> 02:37:20.420
whether they a saint so and they shut down and reopened for like two days.

2784
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:25.430
What day?
What day they will walk.
So that would shut down.

2785
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:30.050
<v 0>Services are the future.
I mean it happened to San Diego.</v>

2786
02:37:30.051 --> 02:37:32.640
It's all delivered tricky though.
Guys get set up and robbed.

2787
02:37:34.130 --> 02:37:36.940
<v 1>Doing right now is,
I'm not smoking bill more.
It don't really matter.</v>

2788
02:37:37.420 --> 02:37:41.200
I do the tubes of the morning.
I went to to,
you know the vape tubes.

2789
02:37:41.201 --> 02:37:42.140
I get there though,

2790
02:37:42.310 --> 02:37:47.310
girl scout cookies or a vape pen and then by one o'clock I pop on edible,

2791
02:37:47.950 --> 02:37:50.500
you know,
so I could buy a box of fucking boobies.

2792
02:37:51.550 --> 02:37:55.300
Boobies or Milo sent me a box,
you know,
that's the thing though.
Belt director.

2793
02:37:55.720 --> 02:37:59.620
So it was you sending them a copy of your fucking license.
Don't mail it to me.

2794
02:37:59.621 --> 02:38:02.320
She knows me,
you know,
she knows I'm legit.
So

2795
02:38:02.610 --> 02:38:04.170
<v 0>yeah,
I'm a big fan of the edibles anywhere.</v>

2796
02:38:05.770 --> 02:38:09.040
<v 1>I'll be getting so much.
I sleep better.</v>

2797
02:38:09.550 --> 02:38:13.510
I put this different water and my sleep apnea machine and now the edibles let me

2798
02:38:13.780 --> 02:38:14.890
sleep a lot better.

2799
02:38:15.050 --> 02:38:17.690
<v 0>Very nice.
And if you want her to stay constantly medicated,</v>

2800
02:38:17.691 --> 02:38:21.040
you could be very functional with a small dose of marijuana.
Marijuana.

2801
02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:23.840
I've taught small apple knows I fucked up last week.

2802
02:38:23.841 --> 02:38:28.460
I got high before acupuncture.
That's fucking brutal.
That would be great.
No,

2803
02:38:28.461 --> 02:38:32.270
she even said something to me getting high before yoga dude that getting high

2804
02:38:32.271 --> 02:38:35.330
before you want to really appreciate we get high before yoga because you get

2805
02:38:35.331 --> 02:38:38.360
high from yoga anyway and if you get high and then do the yoga,

2806
02:38:38.390 --> 02:38:40.050
it releases some crazy.

2807
02:38:40.740 --> 02:38:42.360
<v 1>You do fucking,
you get high.</v>

2808
02:38:42.361 --> 02:38:47.361
You go to even beginning of yoga where I was going 45 minutes passes before you

2809
02:38:47.371 --> 02:38:51.780
even know you have like this a not a hallucinogenic trip.
You have a body trip,

2810
02:38:52.260 --> 02:38:56.550
you start focusing on your knee and you could actually feel the blood going into

2811
02:38:56.551 --> 02:38:58.620
your knee when you're high with the stretches.

2812
02:38:58.950 --> 02:39:00.510
Yoga is really cool and that's what they say.

2813
02:39:00.511 --> 02:39:04.470
They do the hot yoga with weed and it really kicks it up.
I've never done it.

2814
02:39:04.780 --> 02:39:09.150
<v 0>Yoga,
I don't know,
art attack,
bring water,
bring cold water.
But the,</v>

2815
02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:12.170
the good thing about the hot yoga is it really warms you up for stretching

2816
02:39:12.470 --> 02:39:14.660
because when you're cold it's very difficult to stretch.

2817
02:39:14.661 --> 02:39:17.510
That's why I like doing anything like real strenuous early in the morning.

2818
02:39:17.511 --> 02:39:19.970
It's tricky.
You got to really make sure you warm up.

2819
02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.370
When I lift weights in the morning,
a lot of times I do,

2820
02:39:22.371 --> 02:39:26.180
I start my day by lifting weights.
I take a lot,
I take 20 minutes to warm up,

2821
02:39:26.210 --> 02:39:29.390
20 whole minutes of like light kettlebell cleans,

2822
02:39:29.690 --> 02:39:33.980
like swings and cleans,
like light body weight squats,
stretching,

2823
02:39:33.981 --> 02:39:35.330
touching my toes,
moving around.

2824
02:39:35.340 --> 02:39:39.170
Kangol the blood flowing because you got to think for eight hours or whatever

2825
02:39:39.171 --> 02:39:42.950
you sleep for.
You're just sitting there while everything's just the lying flat.

2826
02:39:42.951 --> 02:39:44.960
I mean your blood's pumping and everything like that,

2827
02:39:44.961 --> 02:39:48.470
but there's no movement so everything's kind of stiff and weird.

2828
02:39:48.470 --> 02:39:49.910
That's why when you wake up your back,

2829
02:39:49.911 --> 02:39:53.930
Herb's and if you go to bed for like two seconds and you lay down,

2830
02:39:53.931 --> 02:39:55.970
your back doesn't hurt.
But when you go to bed for eight hours,

2831
02:39:55.971 --> 02:40:00.320
you wake up and be like stiff and it takes you a few minutes and then whatever

2832
02:40:00.321 --> 02:40:03.770
that stiff and it is is gone half an hour,
so.
Right.
It's gone in a little while.

2833
02:40:04.100 --> 02:40:06.410
Got a warm the fuck up.
If you lift in the morning,

2834
02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:08.570
a lot of guys get hurt from that.

2835
02:40:09.010 --> 02:40:11.810
It's one of the main sources of injuries is early morning workouts,

2836
02:40:13.140 --> 02:40:14.190
but I have friends

2837
02:40:14.190 --> 02:40:18.250
<v 1>that have 7:00 AM Jujitsu.
That sounds really cool.
At Dna of Jujitsu,</v>

2838
02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:22.440
like fundamentals.
That sounds cool,
but not for me.
It's okay.

2839
02:40:22.441 --> 02:40:25.800
As long as it's warm.
I like 1130 11 I'm doing other things.

2840
02:40:26.310 --> 02:40:29.790
I've walked around I think nine o'clock my body,
but I would have a heart attack.

2841
02:40:29.791 --> 02:40:30.600
I'm really scared.

2842
02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:30.811
<v 0>Well,</v>

2843
02:40:30.811 --> 02:40:33.960
I have a big difference between like if I have a kickboxing workout at like 10

2844
02:40:33.961 --> 02:40:36.120
in the morning or kickboxing workout at seven at night,

2845
02:40:36.450 --> 02:40:41.040
God damn seven at nine I'm on fire.
I'm on fire real better.
Yeah,
it really,

2846
02:40:41.210 --> 02:40:41.480
<v 1>yeah.</v>

2847
02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:46.480
I like my shit over 11 o'clock 11 the one I've done eight o'clock for me to do

2848
02:40:46.611 --> 02:40:50.750
Jujitsu is fucking brutal about,
uh,
eh.

2849
02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:53.120
You know,
even if I eat dinner at four,

2850
02:40:53.121 --> 02:40:56.660
like if I know I got to go like Friday at seven,
I go to beginner Jiu Jitsu.

2851
02:40:57.110 --> 02:41:01.630
I eat a four.
So there's nobody of the standards.
That's how we got our snow.

2852
02:41:01.650 --> 02:41:05.330
Calisthenics.
We practice the technique.
We roll for eight minutes.

2853
02:41:05.380 --> 02:41:09.730
When the fuck out of that.
That's it.
What do you eat before you work out?
Nothing.

2854
02:41:10.010 --> 02:41:13.600
He'll take the whole,
nothing's less site.
Like if I'm going to do a log Jujitsu,

2855
02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:16.630
I'll take to uh,
shrimp,
Tasha text.

2856
02:41:16.660 --> 02:41:21.660
But I don't do the shoot texts every time I like to space it out.

2857
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:25.210
I could tell the difference when I take a baby aspirin that will,

2858
02:41:25.220 --> 02:41:27.410
that takes true tech.
I see a big fucking difference.

2859
02:41:27.980 --> 02:41:30.890
So if I'm going to do something long that I'll do the shrimp tech.

2860
02:41:31.340 --> 02:41:34.700
If I to do something like kettle bells,
like just a short kettlebell workout,

2861
02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:39.740
10 sets of swigs,
maybe three cleans,
preset to cleans at a farmer's walk.

2862
02:41:39.741 --> 02:41:44.390
I just do a baby aspirin and immediately a protein shake with glutamine and then

2863
02:41:44.391 --> 02:41:48.840
one at night,
he's shaking his 300 calories.
I make them a water right.
The force

2864
02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:52.040
<v 0>get a little bit of sugar in there too.</v>

2865
02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:55.820
A little bit of a natural sugar in your dream died after a workout.
Yeah,

2866
02:41:55.821 --> 02:41:59.000
Replenish Your Glycogen,
your glucose,

2867
02:41:59.270 --> 02:42:03.040
you eat some fruit.
Fruit is good way to do it and do a lot of fruit.
Yeah.

2868
02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:06.590
Fruit juices with protein powder is a good way to do it after a workout,

2869
02:42:06.591 --> 02:42:09.380
but that's when you want to replenish like within 30 minutes.

2870
02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:12.020
But before I like fruit,
before I work out,

2871
02:42:12.050 --> 02:42:15.290
my favorite thing to eat before I work out as either oranges or pineapples

2872
02:42:15.470 --> 02:42:18.200
because there's a lot of fiber in them and I feel like I've ate like three or

2873
02:42:18.201 --> 02:42:20.510
four oranges and then have a good workout an hour later.

2874
02:42:20.511 --> 02:42:24.260
There's no effects like no cramping,
no weirdness,
easy to digest.

2875
02:42:24.660 --> 02:42:28.250
You know pineapples the same way.
He eat like a nice bowl of pineapple,

2876
02:42:28.251 --> 02:42:31.010
like an hour or so before I work out.
It never bothers me at all,

2877
02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:35.650
but you have the fiber from the plant matter and you have plenty of fuel.

2878
02:42:35.950 --> 02:42:38.660
You know,
plenty of sugar in your body,
but natural sugar,

2879
02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:41.960
you know it's shit kills me,
Joe Rogan,
but natural sugar.

2880
02:42:41.970 --> 02:42:43.460
You see when people have sugar,

2881
02:42:43.461 --> 02:42:45.440
if you have sugar from a candy bar or something like that,

2882
02:42:45.441 --> 02:42:49.160
that is the most unnatural form of sugar that human beings have ever created.

2883
02:42:49.161 --> 02:42:50.780
We figured out how to isolate sugar,

2884
02:42:50.781 --> 02:42:55.010
take it away from its natural plants and natural fruits and vegetables and then

2885
02:42:55.011 --> 02:42:59.080
process it and make it this weird thing that you could just add the stuff in

2886
02:42:59.180 --> 02:43:00.140
white powder.

2887
02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:04.130
You know that white powder that doesn't exist in the wild and the effect that it

2888
02:43:04.131 --> 02:43:05.690
has on your body.
Your body's like,

2889
02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:08.030
how are you getting so much sugar in this fucking thing?

2890
02:43:08.370 --> 02:43:12.940
I'll give you have a drink you ever look at,
like if you have just what,
you know,

2891
02:43:12.941 --> 02:43:17.320
one of those power,
those uh,
energy drinks or a,
you know,
post workout drinks,

2892
02:43:17.321 --> 02:43:20.890
hydration,
drinks.
Look at the fucking,
the labels of those things.

2893
02:43:20.891 --> 02:43:24.640
Look at a fruit punch.
Drink fucking red bull.
You good?
Have a seat.

2894
02:43:24.641 --> 02:43:26.050
We drink a red bull.
No you're not.

2895
02:43:26.100 --> 02:43:28.600
You'll have an express every now and then after a meal.

2896
02:43:29.020 --> 02:43:32.470
I like express it after a meal to like red bull energy drinks.

2897
02:43:32.471 --> 02:43:34.630
I don't believe I have enough energy to go on the sugar man.

2898
02:43:34.631 --> 02:43:35.860
The sugar's a motherfucker.

2899
02:43:35.900 --> 02:43:40.660
[inaudible] 75 grams of sugar and shit and you're like that.
That'll kill you.

2900
02:43:40.690 --> 02:43:44.010
That's terrible for you.
Like,
you know,
I can't even taste the regular coke.

2901
02:43:44.650 --> 02:43:49.070
It is horrific syrup.
Dun Dun.
Yeah,

2902
02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:53.250
she had a syrup.
Does that Mexican coke though?
It's a little better.
The,
yeah,

2903
02:43:53.251 --> 02:43:53.741
a little better.

2904
02:43:53.741 --> 02:43:57.420
But it's been a burrito place in Hollywood that sells those Mexico,
Laos,

2905
02:43:57.620 --> 02:44:00.490
you've got them everywhere.
They all get the bottles tastes better.

2906
02:44:00.910 --> 02:44:03.640
It tastes better.
Still not good for you.

2907
02:44:04.380 --> 02:44:06.820
I drank a no soda for three fucking bodies,
Bro.

2908
02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:08.920
There's a great documentary called King Corn.

2909
02:44:09.190 --> 02:44:13.390
It talks about the effect of a corn on your body and like how much corn they

2910
02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:13.910
have,

2911
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:18.880
like how much of an influence corn has because it's corn syrup is used in so

2912
02:44:18.881 --> 02:44:21.250
many different products.
It's a fascinating thing.

2913
02:44:21.630 --> 02:44:24.830
We've got to get back to eating natural foods.
You know,
human beings,

2914
02:44:24.831 --> 02:44:25.990
we've gotten way off track.

2915
02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:30.130
We've made some pretty yummy shit with corn syrup and sugars and things along

2916
02:44:30.131 --> 02:44:32.260
those lines,
but people want to be healthy.

2917
02:44:32.500 --> 02:44:34.750
You got to get back to eating normal healthy foods.

2918
02:44:34.900 --> 02:44:37.720
There's just no way around it.
You got eat salads,

2919
02:44:37.870 --> 02:44:41.110
you got to eat fruits and for most folks,

2920
02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:43.990
eating meat is probably a pretty good idea.
Eat some healthy meats,

2921
02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:45.910
but these fucking,

2922
02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:51.300
the amount of power and the amount of influence that lobbyists and these giant

2923
02:44:51.491 --> 02:44:55.210
companies that push corn syrup and put corn syrup in everything,

2924
02:44:55.211 --> 02:44:57.040
the amount of income that they make from it,

2925
02:44:57.370 --> 02:45:00.490
like the profit generated from corn syrup was crazy.

2926
02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:05.020
Corn Syrup is in like 90% of our snack foods.
If you look around,

2927
02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:07.630
I just made that number up completely out of fat by the way.

2928
02:45:07.930 --> 02:45:11.290
But if you look at up like all the different snacks and different things that

2929
02:45:11.291 --> 02:45:14.800
have corn syrup,
it's fucking staggering.
It's off the charts.

2930
02:45:15.070 --> 02:45:19.270
That's some terrible toxic shit and it's everywhere.
But tastes great.

2931
02:45:20.890 --> 02:45:24.190
They tricky Joe Diaz.
Okay Dude.
This is a dude who's making,

2932
02:45:24.580 --> 02:45:28.020
I should say his name.
Uh,
he's making,
um,

2933
02:45:28.510 --> 02:45:33.240
all organic pot candy's now.
He came by here the other day.
Um,

2934
02:45:33.730 --> 02:45:37.510
he's got a company called,
it's called like a jumbo.
Yeah.

2935
02:45:37.511 --> 02:45:42.370
Jambo Organic Jambo.
I got to get you one of them.
They're fucking fantastic.

2936
02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:47.080
What sort of,
it's honey.
He doesn't with honey.
All organic ingredients.
No,
no.

2937
02:45:47.110 --> 02:45:51.280
High Fructose Corn Syrup.
No artificial sugars,
no artificial sweeteners,

2938
02:45:51.281 --> 02:45:55.880
no artificial flavors.
He's like the first guy to do these organic,
um,

2939
02:45:55.900 --> 02:45:59.740
pot candies and the great,
the great.
Not too strong either.
They don't kill you.

2940
02:46:00.070 --> 02:46:04.120
They're like half of a,
a Chiba chew.
You know,
when you don't get too nutty,

2941
02:46:04.121 --> 02:46:07.150
you'll probably take four of them.
But the craziest Chiba chew those.

2942
02:46:07.151 --> 02:46:10.240
So hide the bed.
There are book on production

2943
02:46:10.240 --> 02:46:13.520
<v 4>of some Shit.
Wow.
They're making cash.
Sundash dog.</v>

2944
02:46:13.610 --> 02:46:18.200
Those little fucking helmet was
the CBDS,

2945
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:23.840
but the dad fucking little devil things really light you up like they really

2946
02:46:23.841 --> 02:46:26.510
scary.
I got to tell you the truth.
People who have injuries,

2947
02:46:26.511 --> 02:46:29.900
if you have an injury take like a cheap but you are half of Chiba chew and then

2948
02:46:29.901 --> 02:46:33.080
stretch out.
You'd be amazed at how good you feel.
You feel yours,

2949
02:46:33.380 --> 02:46:35.750
your muscles lengthening,
loosening up.

2950
02:46:35.751 --> 02:46:38.510
You feel things with half a deck and you go to bed.

2951
02:46:38.511 --> 02:46:42.890
You wake up feeling loose and the hash cookies,
they don't map them.

2952
02:46:42.891 --> 02:46:44.380
The more people are baking with them.
Well,

2953
02:46:44.390 --> 02:46:46.700
there was one company who had a Hollywood,

2954
02:46:47.150 --> 02:46:52.050
it was 20 bucks for two tiny cookies,
but every time I ate those things,

2955
02:46:52.070 --> 02:46:55.220
dog not hassling.
You realize that it was Bruce Lee was.

2956
02:46:55.380 --> 02:46:58.980
He has that because for the,

2957
02:46:59.010 --> 02:47:02.630
for the stiffness in your joints is shit.
I'm telling you.
When you eat hash,

2958
02:47:02.670 --> 02:47:06.410
you eat reef.
It's two different worlds.
Bruce Lee had some serious injuries.

2959
02:47:06.411 --> 02:47:08.180
He had a serious back injury at one point in time,

2960
02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:11.660
but he ate wheat for injuries like he ate.

2961
02:47:11.661 --> 02:47:15.020
We've specifically for the injuries,
well,
for medical marijuana,

2962
02:47:15.021 --> 02:47:16.850
it's one of the number one things that people use it for.

2963
02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:19.670
What's the thing of it was,
so it'd be,
yeah,
but the other one,

2964
02:47:19.671 --> 02:47:22.320
what's the other one?
When you work out,
you eat.

2965
02:47:22.321 --> 02:47:26.480
Let us take the acidity out of your muscles.
That's what it says.
A THC.

2966
02:47:26.481 --> 02:47:28.490
When you smoke it or whatever,

2967
02:47:28.491 --> 02:47:32.420
you adjust or whatever it takes to whatever out of your muscles after you were

2968
02:47:33.530 --> 02:47:37.070
like the guys that inflammation.
Yeah,
I read that might be a lot of bro Science,

2969
02:47:37.071 --> 02:47:41.930
unfortunately.
What's Bro Science?
It's what Brian Cowen does.

2970
02:47:42.500 --> 02:47:45.380
Brian kind of lay some science on you and you know he's not really a scientist.

2971
02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:47.380
I do it all the time,
Bro.
Sciences,

2972
02:47:47.420 --> 02:47:52.100
when you start reciting shit that you heard online pro the fucking,

2973
02:47:52.310 --> 02:47:57.230
the thing with THC it does is it pulls the lactic acid and then you Google it

2974
02:47:57.231 --> 02:48:01.790
and it doesn't do any such thing.
That's bro sides.

2975
02:48:03.290 --> 02:48:06.470
What is that?
A Blue East egg blue is Stephen Dorff.

2976
02:48:06.471 --> 02:48:09.820
You should do that goddamn commercials.
Joe Diaz,
you know,
I mean you,

2977
02:48:09.830 --> 02:48:10.820
you smoked that thing,

2978
02:48:10.821 --> 02:48:13.040
but you're done completely with cigarettes for a long time.

2979
02:48:13.100 --> 02:48:16.220
You don't worry about relapsing back to cigarettes by sucking on that.
No.

2980
02:48:17.420 --> 02:48:19.750
Can you put that down?
Yeah.

2981
02:48:19.850 --> 02:48:22.900
How long have you can go without one of those three or four days?
No problem.

2982
02:48:22.950 --> 02:48:25.460
Done that before I go because I'm talking to you.
I'm loose,

2983
02:48:25.730 --> 02:48:27.950
but it's not aware of me loose.
I can't smoke weed in here.

2984
02:48:28.460 --> 02:48:30.980
I don't really drink coffee.
I want to do something.
Don't listen.

2985
02:48:30.981 --> 02:48:32.150
I've always wanted to do something.

2986
02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:35.150
I don't want to seem like a cop in the fucking room.
You know what I'm saying?

2987
02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:38.720
I don't drink.
How creepy is that?
I'll take us.
I tell you what.

2988
02:48:38.721 --> 02:48:41.480
I like to always take at least one fruity drink at the ice house.

2989
02:48:41.481 --> 02:48:45.260
I can't do that.
No Wall.
The Ice House is great.
The bartenders are great.

2990
02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:49.880
The waitress,
this is a great,
you know,
go to the Ice House,
to the Ice House.

2991
02:48:49.881 --> 02:48:53.240
I could go for a drink at the fucking ice house.
Rub Up that the idea.

2992
02:48:53.241 --> 02:48:57.110
I was craving a beer for three days.
I walked around craving a Budweiser cold.

2993
02:48:57.680 --> 02:48:59.280
I crave cold Heidi kids.

2994
02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:03.170
Why do you have one every now and then do you don't like to drink?
I forget.

2995
02:49:03.650 --> 02:49:06.140
I forget to stop and get a BS.
Listen,

2996
02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:10.800
I will never ever drink and drive like you want to see me flip out.

2997
02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:13.050
Let me have a drink and before us to drive.

2998
02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:17.850
Cause I know I can't keep it together in front of a cop and I know that I could

2999
02:49:17.851 --> 02:49:21.150
never,
I'd have to cop to it like how stupid am I drunk?

3000
02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:22.560
I drank a dry like I would.

3001
02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:27.450
I'm totally against all that shit and I'll get stolen that fucking dude 90 down

3002
02:49:27.451 --> 02:49:31.980
to one off because of guilt because I could handle it,

3003
02:49:31.981 --> 02:49:34.230
but I can't handle alcohol.
Well,

3004
02:49:34.231 --> 02:49:38.580
people think that being drunk and being high and driving a car or the same
thing,

3005
02:49:39.030 --> 02:49:40.950
that's ignorance.
It's not true at all.

3006
02:49:41.190 --> 02:49:45.240
You can smoke pot and do Jujitsu with no problem whatsoever.
No problem.

3007
02:49:45.570 --> 02:49:48.600
Smoked Pot and you're very coordinated.
Smoke Pot and something drops.

3008
02:49:48.601 --> 02:49:52.260
He catch it like a reflex is everything.
They're all there and last.

3009
02:49:52.500 --> 02:49:55.580
You're not used to it if you're not used to it.
All you're thinking of is,

3010
02:49:55.590 --> 02:49:57.210
I remember when I first started getting high,

3011
02:49:57.211 --> 02:50:01.560
Joey started making fun of me because we,
I forget what we did.
We,
oh,

3012
02:50:01.590 --> 02:50:06.590
I remember we went to the fucking Sunday brunch at the House of Blues.

3013
02:50:07.190 --> 02:50:10.450
Remember they had that Gospel Brunch.
Yeah.
And then that Gospel Brunches,

3014
02:50:10.470 --> 02:50:11.640
that's how we all went over there.

3015
02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:15.030
We all went over there and we were toasted to the gills.

3016
02:50:15.031 --> 02:50:18.290
It was like one of the first weekends I ever got high and Joey d is like,
look,

3017
02:50:18.291 --> 02:50:22.470
this is a fucking rookie.
And Cause I was going,
I can't believe a high right now.

3018
02:50:22.500 --> 02:50:26.550
This is ridiculous.
I can't,
I'm,
I'm,
I have to sit here.
I wasn't used to it.

3019
02:50:26.610 --> 02:50:28.770
I didn't know how to deal with it.
Nobody knows at the beginning.

3020
02:50:28.890 --> 02:50:33.180
But if I was the same high right now,
I'd be fine.
Cause I know what that is.

3021
02:50:33.690 --> 02:50:34.051
It's a,

3022
02:50:34.051 --> 02:50:37.730
it's what you're doing is when you're too high and you're paranoid and you're

3023
02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:40.920
frozen,
you're frozen because you don't know what it is.

3024
02:50:40.950 --> 02:50:44.430
You don't know what comes next because this is going to get worse.

3025
02:50:44.670 --> 02:50:49.080
Am I going to get more crazy?
Oh my God.
How long is this going to last?

3026
02:50:49.380 --> 02:50:53.190
But when you're used to be in high,
you're like,
I'm just high dude.
Relax.

3027
02:50:53.430 --> 02:50:57.000
Everything's fine.
You know what it is.
You know the worst it gets.

3028
02:50:57.210 --> 02:50:59.640
You know the best against you felt the full,

3029
02:50:59.790 --> 02:51:04.530
the full range of the effects,
but you were laughing at me.
I'll never forget.

3030
02:51:04.830 --> 02:51:09.120
He's like,
look at his fucking rookie.
So fucking hungry.
We your first,

3031
02:51:10.210 --> 02:51:15.210
when you first get high you get so enjoyably Hungary and joy.

3032
02:51:15.421 --> 02:51:19.890
A bleed like this simple like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is fucking

3033
02:51:19.900 --> 02:51:24.750
flaming mouth.
Yeah.
We're like,
and you eat it with a bag of chips.

3034
02:51:25.690 --> 02:51:30.620
What is your senses?
Right?
It's,
it's so you don't even breathe.

3035
02:51:30.630 --> 02:51:35.420
You just chew it like I have a giggling like I love to giggle,
Bro.

3036
02:51:35.820 --> 02:51:36.541
A couple of weeks ago,

3037
02:51:36.541 --> 02:51:40.950
I had a cookie and I was sitting there so fucking stone at eight o'clock at

3038
02:51:40.951 --> 02:51:42.750
night and I kept thinking to myself,

3039
02:51:42.751 --> 02:51:46.910
this is the same cookie Casey case of eight it was the week that it was.

3040
02:51:47.880 --> 02:51:51.070
It was the week that he was busy.
Then he went missing.
He died or something.

3041
02:51:51.270 --> 02:51:55.230
I felt so bad.
I grew up on fucking Casey case,
but then there was traffic.

3042
02:51:55.380 --> 02:51:56.640
I was watching the news that day.

3043
02:51:56.641 --> 02:51:59.280
There was traffic on the four oh five and I'm like,
oh my God,

3044
02:51:59.850 --> 02:52:02.010
there's traffic on the four or five they'll listen.
They said,

3045
02:52:02.380 --> 02:52:07.370
because the traffic was that the president of Israel was on the four oh five how

3046
02:52:07.510 --> 02:52:11.590
lock half of it down and all I kept thinking about was the president of Israel

3047
02:52:11.710 --> 02:52:16.390
knows about these cookies.
Casey Casey debate.

3048
02:52:16.780 --> 02:52:20.740
He's covered to la to get these cookies.
That's how I was.

3049
02:52:20.741 --> 02:52:24.500
I kept giggling at the thought of my thoughts.
That's hilarious.

3050
02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:27.910
That was happening.
I love that.
I love still giggling.

3051
02:52:28.240 --> 02:52:30.900
That's what I missed the most about being stowed.

3052
02:52:30.901 --> 02:52:35.020
Two girls go to a diner and laughing at the waitress,
just gay.
I ain't going,
boy,

3053
02:52:35.620 --> 02:52:39.640
he just fucking,
you can't control yourself.
Like I just saw that shit.

3054
02:52:39.641 --> 02:52:43.780
The simple pleasures,
wheat but simple black.
That's what I look for.

3055
02:52:43.810 --> 02:52:46.000
The simple pleasures of being too.
Look,

3056
02:52:46.001 --> 02:52:48.940
how many times have we been on the road when we've been in the middle of
nowhere?

3057
02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:53.680
We're were in some town and it's all of us.
You know,
I was like,
you,
me,
Brad,

3058
02:52:53.681 --> 02:52:55.150
bad,
Ori and bill,

3059
02:52:55.151 --> 02:52:59.470
get bold lasted and then we'll go somewhere and have a giggle fest.

3060
02:53:00.010 --> 02:53:01.780
Like especially when it's all of us.

3061
02:53:01.990 --> 02:53:04.750
You know when we have a good group of like two or three of us and we go

3062
02:53:04.751 --> 02:53:07.540
somewhere on the road and you get really high in some town,

3063
02:53:07.690 --> 02:53:10.060
it's like we're all in it together.
You know,

3064
02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:13.150
we're lucky sitting in Starbucks or eating lunch somewhere,

3065
02:53:13.151 --> 02:53:15.630
he or Joey Diaz at,

3066
02:53:15.631 --> 02:53:20.160
we're all stoned and we're trying to get the gps working and asking me meltdown.

3067
02:53:21.160 --> 02:53:23.080
Well,
that was when Joe,
Joe used to have,

3068
02:53:23.081 --> 02:53:26.470
when you were at your heaviest used to have food meltdowns.
When you would land,

3069
02:53:26.500 --> 02:53:29.950
you'd have to eat right away.
Do I get anxiety?
I was getting anxiety,

3070
02:53:30.010 --> 02:53:32.560
but it wasn't not when we remember when Austin,

3071
02:53:32.561 --> 02:53:35.380
you were yelling because we were trying to find someplace to eat those little,

3072
02:53:35.381 --> 02:53:36.001
I couldn't do it.

3073
02:53:36.001 --> 02:53:40.240
It wasn't just sugar was I just wanted to get to my room and fucking figure out

3074
02:53:40.241 --> 02:53:43.680
how I was going to do blow bro.
Was that what it is?
But you were eating well.

3075
02:53:43.681 --> 02:53:46.540
We went to some place.
I wasn't doing blow the daytime.

3076
02:53:47.020 --> 02:53:49.900
I didn't have time to ride around.
Listen,
when I get off the fucking blame.

3077
02:53:50.410 --> 02:53:54.190
I got this time.
You've already got this tie with me.
How would you set that up?

3078
02:53:54.191 --> 02:53:56.580
Did you have like a network?
Yeah,

3079
02:53:56.620 --> 02:53:59.380
people voices as you get the tongue just talking about it on stage,

3080
02:53:59.470 --> 02:54:02.800
but I mean like say if you were going to fly into Austin,
like say if you needed,

3081
02:54:02.830 --> 02:54:03.663
you needed coke.

3082
02:54:03.700 --> 02:54:08.270
Did you already know people that you'd get coke from land you covered?

3083
02:54:08.290 --> 02:54:13.120
We're going to come see you.
And that was code for,
we're bringing it.
Uh,
so I do,

3084
02:54:13.121 --> 02:54:17.080
but I didn't know at that time at Austin.
I just,
still to this day,

3085
02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:21.700
I have flooded anxiety.
When I get off a plane,
I got time to dilly dally.

3086
02:54:21.970 --> 02:54:25.000
I don't want to walk.
I don't want to talk.
I want to get to the root.

3087
02:54:25.060 --> 02:54:29.810
Let me go upstairs.
Let me take a shit.
I'll be checking and be relaxed.

3088
02:54:29.850 --> 02:54:33.670
Then we'll do whatever the fuck you want to do.
Forget the fucking gps.

3089
02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.470
We should've got a car with a driver to get us through the whole top.

3090
02:54:36.760 --> 02:54:40.150
I ain't got time to land at four o'clock.

3091
02:54:40.151 --> 02:54:43.390
The fuck would go in the traffic with GPS.
Till this day.

3092
02:54:43.391 --> 02:54:47.890
I dread landing in lax after 12 other Sunday.

3093
02:54:47.891 --> 02:54:52.290
I won't do it.
I'm going back to Austin.
Uh,
I'm doing the,
uh,

3094
02:54:52.300 --> 02:54:55.930
I'm actually doing a comedy club this time because I'm preparing for my comedy

3095
02:54:55.931 --> 02:54:58.720
special.
So I'm doing cap city for the first time in years.

3096
02:54:58.750 --> 02:55:00.850
I haven't done cap city and fucking happy.

3097
02:55:00.851 --> 02:55:02.990
Those people going up the 15th and the 16th you know,

3098
02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:08.540
<v 0>August.
Yeah.
How happy am I going to be?
I can't wait.
I love that place and I,</v>

3099
02:55:08.541 --> 02:55:11.540
you know,
I love doing the theater there.
Last time I did,
uh,

3100
02:55:11.570 --> 02:55:15.960
Austin city limits when I was there this time.
Yeah,
I'm fucking pumped.
I'm,

3101
02:55:16.430 --> 02:55:19.760
I like mixing it up,
man.
That is a great [inaudible]

3102
02:55:20.240 --> 02:55:23.600
<v 4>old real comedy club.
I really enjoyed myself there.</v>

3103
02:55:24.060 --> 02:55:28.400
I Viv used to it.
Now the last four times I've been there,
I love them.

3104
02:55:28.580 --> 02:55:31.310
There's no better time.
There's no better time.
Like Margie,

3105
02:55:31.550 --> 02:55:33.550
I liked the double tree.
I liked,

3106
02:55:33.551 --> 02:55:37.190
they've now they put you in a new hotel that's fucking funky or is she know more

3107
02:55:37.191 --> 02:55:39.680
doubletree?
Nah,
you're downtown and shit.

3108
02:55:39.681 --> 02:55:43.190
They rebuilt downtown you somewhere else and it was really interesting.

3109
02:55:45.330 --> 02:55:50.150
Papa Papa,
Papa goes,
Hey Papa.
Tito's is around the corner.
Yeah,

3110
02:55:50.151 --> 02:55:52.550
right up the street.
Right up the fucking walked in both of them.

3111
02:55:52.790 --> 02:55:56.530
Fuddruckers Fuddruckers yeah,
that's right.
[inaudible]

3112
02:55:56.950 --> 02:56:01.480
<v 0>apparently you got it.
We don't,
but you gotta fuck with this.
There's,</v>

3113
02:56:01.481 --> 02:56:06.030
there's some barbecue joints in Austin right now that are so off the charts are,

3114
02:56:06.031 --> 02:56:07.570
he said there was a line for it.

3115
02:56:07.670 --> 02:56:12.230
<v 4>Brianna was three out has wait for three hours.
I'm not my boob lift.
Cuba,</v>

3116
02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:13.910
listen,
Hey,
wait a little.
Yeah,

3117
02:56:13.911 --> 02:56:16.940
you could pay a guy like dollars an hour the way down if that's what he did.

3118
02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:19.190
I know that,
but guess what?

3119
02:56:19.740 --> 02:56:24.160
<v 0>What?
I don't think they'll be sustaining the life for three hours for food.</v>

3120
02:56:24.170 --> 02:56:27.220
I think they should stand on and I think when you get to the front line,

3121
02:56:27.221 --> 02:56:29.710
text me and I'll fucking show up and I'll give you 100 bucks.

3122
02:56:29.970 --> 02:56:32.260
They drive it to Joe,
they drive it,
drive it.

3123
02:56:32.261 --> 02:56:34.570
That's not good because then by the time it gets to you,
it's not hot anymore.

3124
02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:37.750
Plus you want to get it of his fingers in my brisket.
Yeah,
you don't want that.

3125
02:56:37.900 --> 02:56:41.230
You want to get it right when the guy pulls it off of the meat,
like boom,

3126
02:56:41.231 --> 02:56:43.540
puts it on a plate.
You want to be there.
While that all goes down,

3127
02:56:43.690 --> 02:56:46.090
Anthony Bordain waited in line just like everybody else.

3128
02:56:46.540 --> 02:56:49.180
I forget the name of the place.
I want to say Franklin or something like that.

3129
02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:54.070
Yeah.
We're almost out of time here to talk to you.
I love you.
I love you too.

3130
02:56:54.071 --> 02:56:56.950
You motherfucker.
Fuck this.
I got to take a water on the way up.

3131
02:56:57.170 --> 02:57:00.220
You can take whatever you want to take.
One of the CTO,
coconut waters.

3132
02:57:00.221 --> 02:57:02.830
I love you brothers started a sponsoring fighters.

3133
02:57:02.831 --> 02:57:05.770
I was watching a RFA the other day.
Some dude had CTO,

3134
02:57:05.780 --> 02:57:09.880
coconut water on his shorts,
so salute to you see two.
Oh,

3135
02:57:11.170 --> 02:57:14.380
thank you sir.
Awesome.
The fucking,
it's delicious coconut water too.

3136
02:57:14.381 --> 02:57:16.600
If you don't like coconut water,
try see too well,

3137
02:57:16.601 --> 02:57:18.700
because it's all with Thai coconuts.

3138
02:57:18.730 --> 02:57:21.970
Thai coconuts is a short plants like the Tom Cruise of coconuts,

3139
02:57:22.300 --> 02:57:26.790
so only five feet tall and they're super delicious.
It's like a sweet sort of,

3140
02:57:26.791 --> 02:57:29.350
it almost feels like they add sugar,
but they don't and just how it tastes.

3141
02:57:29.700 --> 02:57:31.000
That's right.
You can even have,

3142
02:57:31.001 --> 02:57:34.330
they even have some with the pulp if you like that chewy shit.
Yeah,
I try.

3143
02:57:34.380 --> 02:57:37.330
I like that.
It's not bad.
I like without pulp,
the bass,
but I liked,

3144
02:57:37.420 --> 02:57:41.350
I don't pass on the pulp ones.
I used a CTO and a lot of mixed drinks.

3145
02:57:41.351 --> 02:57:44.080
It's great for a mixer.
Yeah,
I would imagine.
Right.

3146
02:57:44.140 --> 02:57:47.890
Which I would imagine it tastes really dehydrated the same time you hydrate.

3147
02:57:47.950 --> 02:57:50.650
Yeah.
So I got a couple of clubs coming up in July.

3148
02:57:50.651 --> 02:57:55.480
I'm doing wise guys and Salt Lake.

3161
