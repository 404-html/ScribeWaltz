1
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Can we go four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.290
<v Speaker 1>two</v>

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.990
<v Speaker 2>on boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now we're live.</v>

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.910
<v Speaker 2>How are you sir?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am wonderful.</v>

5
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.560
<v Speaker 2>We had wonderful chat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ofsted.</v>

6
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably would love to have had that</v>

7
00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:17.030
<v Speaker 2>on here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just.</v>

8
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

9
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.460
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never want to do that to you.</v>

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no idea.</v>

11
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.100
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to do that too.</v>

12
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.160
<v Speaker 2>So listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great to see you again.</v>

14
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.480
<v Speaker 2>It's good to see you again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Been a while.</v>

15
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

16
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.590
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ran into each other once in a bar,</v>

17
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.150
<v Speaker 2>men with a random eye candy and I tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>her that what it's called.</v>

18
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.990
<v Speaker 2>I turned around and you turn around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we made eye contact and eye candy.</v>

19
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.610
<v Speaker 2>That was a long time and still have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be about 25 years ago.</v>

20
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:44.444
<v Speaker 2>Four years ago now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

21
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.790
<v Speaker 2>I know we talked about doing a podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then even.</v>

22
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad we finally got together and do</v>

23
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:48.620
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

24
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Let me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be fun.</v>

25
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.760
<v Speaker 2>You did that TV show that I did a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time ago.</v>

26
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan questions everything and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>blew me away.</v>

27
00:00:57.201 --> 00:01:02.201
<v Speaker 2>You and me and Duncan and you showed us</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the tricks that people use.</v>

28
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Well you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You showed us that they were tricks,</v>

29
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.300
<v Speaker 2>but you didn't show us how to do the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tricks.</v>

30
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Broke one thing down for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was about it.</v>

31
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:14.570
<v Speaker 2>It was a psychological thing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

32
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:14.961
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

33
00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 2>it's better to know that you can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>fooled rather than tell you how you can</v>

34
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Speaker 2>be fooled and we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get into this about with</v>

35
00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 2>scientists and how I fold them in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>

36
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:26.600
<v Speaker 2>but people always tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you just teach Paris the</v>

37
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:30.500
<v Speaker 2>tricks and the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is for every single trick that I have,</v>

38
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 2>I probably have about seven or eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>methods,</v>

39
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.550
<v Speaker 2>so if I teach you one method,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

40
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.430
<v Speaker 2>somebody else will come along and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>a method had been to key.</v>

41
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.910
<v Speaker 2>They'll do it a completely different</v>
<v Speaker 2>convincing way and you'll be looking for</v>

42
00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:43.670
<v Speaker 2>that one method and you may say because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have the experience,</v>

43
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:45.830
<v Speaker 2>you may say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

44
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.290
<v Speaker 2>this has to be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how the tricks done.</v>

45
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.830
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are actually doing something</v>

46
00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:53.720
<v Speaker 2>completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has to be real,</v>

47
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.810
<v Speaker 2>so it's better to get an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this one because my</v>

48
00:01:56.811 --> 00:02:01.460
<v Speaker 2>friend Eddie was at Venice beach and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was doing.</v>

49
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 2>He has like some save the rain forest</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and he said,</v>

50
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:09.971
<v Speaker 2>if I tell you your birthday will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you listen to me and and donate</v>

51
00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:11.660
<v Speaker 2>some money or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

52
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.703
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

53
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 2>and he just goes May 15th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

54
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.180
<v Speaker 2>Just straight out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:18.470
<v Speaker 2>I just figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

56
00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:21.400
<v Speaker 2>how could someone do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you because I wasn't there.</v>

57
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 2>There could've been other circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could have been something you</v>

58
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:25.880
<v Speaker 2>overheard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could have been something he seen.</v>

59
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:28.340
<v Speaker 2>He may have been in the store when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy took his driver's license that they</v>

60
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.920
<v Speaker 2>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a million things that could have</v>

61
00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:35.240
<v Speaker 2>happened that your friend Eddie was not</v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of before that guy even walked up</v>

62
00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:36.680
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can't.</v>

63
00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:39.140
<v Speaker 2>I really can't answer that because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstantial.</v>

64
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.840
<v Speaker 2>And here's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does Eddie really remember everything</v>

65
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 2>exactly the way that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

66
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.180
<v Speaker 2>has he forgotten something and left</v>
<v Speaker 2>something out in that story because he's</v>

67
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:50.300
<v Speaker 2>told it so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And usually here's the thing,</v>

68
00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:53.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people want to convince you of</v>

69
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they embellish and the more times they</v>

70
00:02:56.921 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 2>tell that story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that embellishment their reality,</v>

71
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 3>they basically create a whole new</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality for themselves that they forget</v>

72
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 3>that maybe they wrote it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they forget that maybe they said</v>

73
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they forget that the person might have</v>

74
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 3>asked specific questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might've said,</v>

75
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get the feeling that you're probably</v>

76
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 3>not born in the beginning of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe later in the year,</v>

77
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 3>maybe in the fall or something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

78
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 3>Person says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

79
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 3>but I am bought land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the edit now,</v>

80
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the winter time,</v>

81
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 3>so now you get within a few months right</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

82
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are always within mentalism,</v>

83
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 3>which is what I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mentalist and we'll explain what that</v>

84
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 3>is in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

85
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 3>there are ways to do those things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's many ways to do those types of</v>

86
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So without being there,</v>

87
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell you exactly what your</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend Eddie experience to him,</v>

88
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 3>it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very real.</v>

89
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 3>You don't believe in any psychic power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've started to say,</v>

90
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fair to say,</v>

91
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 3>but if you just say it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds very cold.</v>

92
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 3>It kind of sounds like I'm an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a dick.</v>

93
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm a skeptic there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

94
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't because it means I'm not.</v>

95
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 3>Haven't been open minded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am very open minded about these things</v>

96
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 3>and whenever I investigating new</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomena I opened,</v>

97
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.660
<v Speaker 3>I stepped back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put everything that I,</v>

98
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

99
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:06.820
<v Speaker 3>it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put that aside and go,</v>

100
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 3>this could be the one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to give him a chance,</v>

101
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am going to be a little bit skeptical.</v>

102
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 3>I am going to do a double blind test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am going to step back and look at it</v>

103
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 3>from a scientific point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be stupid about this</v>

104
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not going to let them get away</v>
<v Speaker 3>with something.</v>

105
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 3>And I also know they may be self</v>
<v Speaker 3>deceived and I've seen so much of this</v>

106
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 3>type of phenomena that I usually know</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on when I do see it.</v>

107
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:35.221
<v Speaker 3>So I can honestly say that I've seen so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much phenomena and I've looked at so</v>

108
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 3>much of it and I've seen the best people</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there and I've tested some of the</v>

109
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 3>best people out there that I have not</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen anything indicative.</v>

110
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.880
<v Speaker 3>That psychic phenomena is genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard of anyone who is</v>

111
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.130
<v Speaker 3>reasonably believable that it's seen</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that counts?</v>

112
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 3>I hear that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

113
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 3>When you see a John Edward on tv or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear these,</v>

114
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:00.760
<v Speaker 3>these antidotes and stuff like that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like you're telling me about</v>

115
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're telling me that sounds like,</v>

116
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.460
<v Speaker 3>oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that person could be really psychic,</v>

117
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 3>but I know that there's probably more</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on when that person.</v>

118
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you answered the way you</v>
<v Speaker 3>answered because that doesn't make a lot</v>

119
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 3>of sense that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did tell stories and people do</v>

120
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:18.600
<v Speaker 3>forget how the story actually went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The human memory is very flawed.</v>

121
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.453
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

122
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can change a person's memory,</v>

123
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been plenty of experiments that</v>

124
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 3>have done on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take a certain group of people,</v>

125
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.150
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember what her name is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not coming to me.</v>

126
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have dyslexia as well,</v>

127
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 3>which is really weird when you see what</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do on stage because I work with</v>

128
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:34.780
<v Speaker 3>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I work with names and they use a lot of</v>

129
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:38.620
<v Speaker 3>mnemonics for these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I really hard time recalling names</v>

130
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 3>and books that I read and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

131
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.550
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to come to me,</v>

132
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.480
<v Speaker 3>but it takes a while for those things to</v>
<v Speaker 3>your work.</v>

133
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 3>Like what does it does?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always thought that it switched things</v>

134
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 3>a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it in high school at it.</v>

135
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 3>It does switch things around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

136
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things like if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>working with numbers,</v>

137
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even.</v>

138
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 3>I think what it is is I got so</v>
<v Speaker 3>disappointed numbers when I was young.</v>

139
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 3>I love numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the fact that everything in the</v>

140
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his numbers I.</v>

141
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 3>I love the idea of numbers of what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

142
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.250
<v Speaker 3>but I think when I was young I would get</v>
<v Speaker 3>so frustrated even in high school and in</v>

143
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 3>middle school I would do math problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would figure out a way that worked</v>

144
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:19.820
<v Speaker 3>for me to do the math problem and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>the teacher would come up,</v>

145
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:21.020
<v Speaker 3>they say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>show your work,</v>

146
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.520
<v Speaker 3>and I would put it down and they'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

147
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 3>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got,</v>

148
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.600
<v Speaker 3>but I got the right answer yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the way we do it.</v>

149
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 3>You need to do it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the normal way of doing things was</v>

150
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 3>extremely difficult for me to switch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It switches numbers around,</v>

151
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you're trying to switch the</v>

152
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 3>letters for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll use words that are the wrong words.</v>

153
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 3>I could be talking to you during this</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast and then I'll listen to the</v>

154
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 3>podcasts and I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

155
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 3>why did I use that word?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

156
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a thing where,</v>

157
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you an example of the type of</v>

158
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 3>things that happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a line when I say,</v>

159
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

160
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 3>in some of my shows where I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

161
00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.890
<v Speaker 3>I read thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not minds.</v>

162
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 3>What do I mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Husband and wife are sitting on a park</v>

163
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:04.550
<v Speaker 3>bench,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty gold goes jogging by husband,</v>

164
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 3>turns his head and looks wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slaps the husband in the face.</v>

165
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 3>We know what the husband was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know what the wife was thinking,</v>

166
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:11.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We haven't read their minds but we do</v>

167
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 3>know what their thoughts are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's sort of that body language</v>

168
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember one time doing this for a</v>

169
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 3>skeptic's group and I was on stage and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

170
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.030
<v Speaker 3>husband wife is sitting on a park bench,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty girl walks by husband slaps the</v>

171
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:26.440
<v Speaker 3>wife in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said it exactly the opposite of the</v>

172
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.100
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they just thought it was a joke.</v>

173
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 3>Like they thought I was being stupid and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just just a joke.</v>

174
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.330
<v Speaker 3>But I do that kind of stuff consistently</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have a really hard,</v>

175
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:37.280
<v Speaker 3>like if you say so a lot of people will</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that,</v>

176
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's really bad for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I do.</v>

177
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I do it consistently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>

178
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.030
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll talk about things and I hear you</v>

179
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:48.920
<v Speaker 3>talk about things and you'll use words</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I actually know what the word</v>

180
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 3>means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I wanted to recall that word and</v>

181
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:52.970
<v Speaker 3>use it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cannot remember it,</v>

182
00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 3>but what's the mechanism like?</v>

183
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 3>What is happening in your mind where it</v>
<v Speaker 3>switches things around?</v>

184
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.070
<v Speaker 3>I'll call it dyslexia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

185
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.940
<v Speaker 3>For me it's just they call it with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the effect and it's a really fucked</v>

186
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:05.571
<v Speaker 3>up word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

187
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 3>For dyslexics to use dyslexia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when they come up with a better</v>

188
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:13.200
<v Speaker 3>word for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard for dyslexia.</v>

189
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 3>That's the way it is with all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

190
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.830
<v Speaker 3>But it's like I got to list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an s in there.</v>

191
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

192
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.930
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

193
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

194
00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:25.580
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>

195
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.270
<v Speaker 3>is there anybody that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's the James Randy</v>

196
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:29.970
<v Speaker 3>challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

197
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.410
<v Speaker 3>Famously were which I was in charge of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the million dollars and I tested many</v>

198
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:35.340
<v Speaker 3>psychics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I guess what I should do is probably</v>

199
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.141
<v Speaker 3>we're in charge of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How?</v>

200
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.930
<v Speaker 3>So?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go back to the beginning.</v>

201
00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:41.240
<v Speaker 3>So you understand how I got here on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>journey,</v>

202
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:42.060
<v Speaker 3>if that's okay.</v>

203
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.690
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll talk about a couple of personal</v>

204
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 3>things in the very beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was born in 1960,</v>

205
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.490
<v Speaker 3>so I'm 58 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

206
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.170
<v Speaker 3>so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

207
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:52.700
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was born in England,</v>

208
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.830
<v Speaker 3>left there and came to the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

209
00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 3>My mom divorced my dad in that year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went back to England and I'm giving you</v>

210
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 3>this so you understand where I'm coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>from and how I got on this journey.</v>

211
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had two kids.</v>

212
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we immigrated to South Africa in 1969.</v>

213
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 3>She abandoned me in South Africa that</v>
<v Speaker 3>time with my two brothers a year and</v>

214
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:11.580
<v Speaker 3>three years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a stepfather who was an</v>

215
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:14.250
<v Speaker 3>alcoholic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We saw and maybe on Sundays maybe if I</v>

216
00:09:14.251 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 3>drag them in from the car into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>

217
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 3>we would see him then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was changing diapers.</v>

218
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 3>I was taken care of my brothers and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

219
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.220
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

220
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 3>and I was there until I was 15 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

221
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.810
<v Speaker 3>Now it was during that time that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard a guy by the name of Eric</v>

222
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] who was a famous psychic and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the first one to claim that he</v>

223
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 3>could actually been objects with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>

224
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:34.680
<v Speaker 3>like silverware and became really famous</v>
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>

225
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.550
<v Speaker 3>He was supposedly a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did research with him at standard,</v>

226
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.450
<v Speaker 3>a stanford researcher at Stanford,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stanford,</v>

227
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Stanford Research Institute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was using that sort of as an</v>

228
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 3>endorsement to say that he was genuine</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things that gala did was</v>

229
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 3>he said if you bring metalogics to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>radio,</v>

230
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.000
<v Speaker 3>you can get them to bend as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>

231
00:09:54.001 --> 00:09:57.340
<v Speaker 3>think about my radio</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the radio.</v>

232
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.240
<v Speaker 3>There was no talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no tv there at the time.</v>

233
00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:03.450
<v Speaker 3>They had Springbok TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have the actual station,</v>

234
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.780
<v Speaker 3>but they were putting it up and they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>tvs in the store at the time,</v>

235
00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:09.750
<v Speaker 3>but they were playing Papaya,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vhs movies back then,</v>

236
00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:10.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the one.</v>

237
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.850
<v Speaker 3>However they played it back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no TV station.</v>

238
00:10:12.851 --> 00:10:15.510
<v Speaker 3>So that was the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody there listened to the radio</v>

239
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.820
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you bring it to the radio,</v>

240
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.250
<v Speaker 3>you can do it with the unleashed powers</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your mind.</v>

241
00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:22.260
<v Speaker 3>You can get metal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I went around the house.</v>

242
00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:27.261
<v Speaker 3>I found a little pin and my mom's old</v>
<v Speaker 3>sewing kit and I held it up and I looked</v>

243
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:31.530
<v Speaker 3>at it and I studied it and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrated on it and it bent well on a</v>

244
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:33.560
<v Speaker 3>micro level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least I thought it bends,</v>

245
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 3>so I convinced myself that it had been</v>
<v Speaker 3>my noodly and another that years later,</v>

246
00:10:38.281 --> 00:10:43.281
<v Speaker 3>but in my mind I had got that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From there I went to Australia to go be</v>

247
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:47.520
<v Speaker 3>with my biological dad and from there to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado and it was while I was in</v>

248
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:49.680
<v Speaker 3>Colorado that I picked up a book by</v>
<v Speaker 3>James,</v>

249
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:54.100
<v Speaker 3>the Amazing Randy and that book said the</v>
<v Speaker 3>truth about Uri Geller.</v>

250
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.910
<v Speaker 3>And in fact the book was changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The name was changed years later to the</v>

251
00:10:56.911 --> 00:11:00.120
<v Speaker 3>truth about the truth of Uri Geller from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the magic of Uri Geller.</v>

252
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:05.570
<v Speaker 3>And that book basically said that early</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a magician posing as a psychic and</v>

253
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:10.080
<v Speaker 3>no adult had ever told me that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the adults that I did know they</v>

254
00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:12.180
<v Speaker 3>believed in early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I believe in is one I learned a</v>

255
00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:14.520
<v Speaker 3>valuable lesson just because people in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>position of authority,</v>

256
00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:17.970
<v Speaker 3>because there are adults that old or new</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't make everything they say</v>

257
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.370
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which I learned it that way.</v>

258
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because keep in mind I was really</v>

259
00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:25.380
<v Speaker 3>socially inept because I was always</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking care of my brothers.</v>

260
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:27.750
<v Speaker 3>I had no free time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I wasn't hanging out with other kids.</v>

261
00:11:27.751 --> 00:11:29.190
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't doing those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a great life,</v>

262
00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:31.920
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a really great life in South</v>

263
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.570
<v Speaker 3>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did stupid stuff like jumping off</v>

264
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:34.920
<v Speaker 3>bridges into trains.</v>

265
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.000
<v Speaker 3>This will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get apples,</v>

266
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.220
<v Speaker 3>I have apples to eat at home and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

267
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.840
<v Speaker 3>Jump off the train and take it home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those were great things.</v>

268
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.790
<v Speaker 3>Those are great times actually believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it sounds like it's really</v>

269
00:11:44.791 --> 00:11:45.624
<v Speaker 3>sad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

270
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.260
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read this book and in the book,</v>

271
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Randy sort of mentioned eludes to a</v>

272
00:11:52.141 --> 00:11:55.620
<v Speaker 3>method for bending a nail and so I</v>
<v Speaker 3>picked the,</v>

273
00:11:55.621 --> 00:11:57.790
<v Speaker 3>I got some nails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started creating my own ways.</v>

274
00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:01.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of a problem solver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can you give me something you want to</v>

275
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 3>do and I can go ahead and figure out a</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to do it.</v>

276
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:06.530
<v Speaker 3>It's why I worked for people like Chris</v>
<v Speaker 3>Angel and you know,</v>

277
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.510
<v Speaker 3>David Blaine open his second TV special</v>
<v Speaker 3>with one of my effects and I'm the first</v>

278
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:14.380
<v Speaker 3>person to be buried alive six feet on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground shaman handcuffed in a coffin</v>

279
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:17.470
<v Speaker 3>and dig my way to the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I've done twice and almost died</v>

280
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.490
<v Speaker 3>twice during that.</v>

281
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

282
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.600
<v Speaker 3>getting back on track here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll get back to that later.</v>

283
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I to hear about that.</v>

284
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.440
<v Speaker 3>So I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just gloss over that sir.</v>

285
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 3>I'll gloss over a whole bunch of crap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done crazy crazy stuff where I</v>

286
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:32.770
<v Speaker 3>should be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look back now and I go,</v>

287
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.730
<v Speaker 3>I am really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

288
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.070
<v Speaker 3>even when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was crawling down just just,</v>

289
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.370
<v Speaker 3>just to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd look at the top story window and I'd</v>

290
00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:41.410
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I follow down that drain pipe.</v>

291
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:44.680
<v Speaker 3>I think I can do it upside down and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>would actually climb upside down using</v>

292
00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:48.190
<v Speaker 3>my feet to keep myself up there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>climb down the drain pipe to get down.</v>

293
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:49.330
<v Speaker 3>So I did a lot of dump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dump,</v>

294
00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 3>dump stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

295
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 3>so I was in high school and I started to</v>
<v Speaker 3>create methods for bending silverware.</v>

296
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.680
<v Speaker 3>So much so that all the kids there went</v>
<v Speaker 3>to plastics are being,</v>

297
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.040
<v Speaker 3>their school actually went to plastic</v>
<v Speaker 3>silverware because all the kids in there</v>

298
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.470
<v Speaker 3>we'll bring in all their silverware to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

299
00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:05.050
<v Speaker 3>So we were getting low and silverware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

300
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:06.910
<v Speaker 3>they went to plastic silverware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got in trouble.</v>

301
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.210
<v Speaker 3>You were bending the silverware with</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind,</v>

302
00:13:09.211 --> 00:13:10.210
<v Speaker 3>is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

303
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:14.080
<v Speaker 3>I was making it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was using tricks to make it look like</v>

304
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:15.330
<v Speaker 3>I was bending it with my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

305
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.200
<v Speaker 3>I was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was basically doing what Gallo is</v>

306
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:20.020
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only the difference was is I didn't</v>

307
00:13:20.021 --> 00:13:22.510
<v Speaker 3>realize it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but until I saw yellow I was.</v>

308
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.260
<v Speaker 3>I'd never seen Gallo work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just heard about him on the radio and</v>

309
00:13:26.261 --> 00:13:28.480
<v Speaker 3>I heard you're supposed to see the metal</v>
<v Speaker 3>band,</v>

310
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.870
<v Speaker 3>so in my mind the effects that I created</v>
<v Speaker 3>to bend metal,</v>

311
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.900
<v Speaker 3>you actually saw the forks and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>spoons and that bending and if you see</v>

312
00:13:34.901 --> 00:13:38.440
<v Speaker 3>any magician working today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than likely they're using a couple</v>

313
00:13:38.441 --> 00:13:42.560
<v Speaker 3>of my techniques to make metal look like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually bending A.</v>

314
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.280
<v Speaker 3>I even figured a way to make the school</v>
<v Speaker 3>bell go off so we can get out of school</v>

315
00:13:45.281 --> 00:13:46.450
<v Speaker 3>early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got suspended for that.</v>

316
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.180
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I could know how.</v>

317
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how'd you do that?</v>

318
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.960
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a wire and there was a short</v>

319
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.050
<v Speaker 3>that goes through this one classroom</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was in and I was able to figure</v>

320
00:13:56.051 --> 00:13:58.120
<v Speaker 3>out how to exactly how to get that short</v>
<v Speaker 3>to work with.</v>

321
00:13:58.121 --> 00:14:00.510
<v Speaker 3>The bell would go off and we got out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>school early.</v>

322
00:14:00.511 --> 00:14:02.650
<v Speaker 3>It was just connecting the two and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you and connect.</v>

323
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:04.210
<v Speaker 3>You connect and it goes off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was like,</v>

324
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:04.811
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

325
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:07.690
<v Speaker 3>this is great and good that I with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>clock up on the wall,</v>

326
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:11.950
<v Speaker 3>if you look at a clock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized that as the clock hand goes</v>

327
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:15.760
<v Speaker 3>around all the way around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like it's slowing down when it</v>

328
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:16.390
<v Speaker 3>comes back up.</v>

329
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.460
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just an optical illusion from one</v>

330
00:14:18.461 --> 00:14:20.350
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I would make kids think that I was</v>

331
00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:24.490
<v Speaker 3>making the clock slow down and I figured</v>
<v Speaker 3>a way on an old time timex watch that I</v>

332
00:14:24.491 --> 00:14:28.960
<v Speaker 3>used to be at a way that if I pulled the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stem out and slowly turned it backwards</v>

333
00:14:28.961 --> 00:14:31.900
<v Speaker 3>and pushed it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the secondhand would keep moving for</v>

334
00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:35.620
<v Speaker 3>about 35 seconds and then it would just</v>
<v Speaker 3>start like going click,</v>

335
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.491
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>

336
00:14:36.491 --> 00:14:39.130
<v Speaker 3>and then it would stop so I could put my</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching somebody's hands.</v>

337
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:42.100
<v Speaker 3>So I come up with all these different</v>
<v Speaker 3>methods for accomplishing all these</v>

338
00:14:42.101 --> 00:14:44.560
<v Speaker 3>different feats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started learning how to do a thing</v>

339
00:14:44.561 --> 00:14:46.960
<v Speaker 3>called muscle reading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we can talk about in a little bit.</v>

340
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.130
<v Speaker 3>Muscle reading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

341
00:14:48.131 --> 00:14:51.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like if it's an old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old technique that nobody uses and I was</v>

342
00:14:51.171 --> 00:14:53.720
<v Speaker 3>really surprised that people were not</v>
<v Speaker 3>using it,</v>

343
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:57.440
<v Speaker 3>but it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really popular back in the late 18</v>

344
00:14:57.441 --> 00:14:59.720
<v Speaker 3>hundreds where if you.</v>

345
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 3>If I take your wrist and it's based upon</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idiomotor response,</v>

346
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 3>if I take your risks and I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at my other hand and I want you to</v>

347
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:10.670
<v Speaker 3>imagine it actually touching an object.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of one of these objects,</v>

348
00:15:10.671 --> 00:15:13.550
<v Speaker 3>five objects on a table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of my hand actually touching it</v>

349
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.840
<v Speaker 3>and I move my left hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you're not holding here.</v>

350
00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 3>Actually I'm holding who you with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>right hand,</v>

351
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.590
<v Speaker 3>but I'm moving your hand in sync with</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

352
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.300
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're thinking,</v>

353
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.100
<v Speaker 3>go to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the left or the left.</v>

354
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.170
<v Speaker 3>I can actually feel the resistance when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to the right in your arm so you</v>

355
00:15:30.171 --> 00:15:31.490
<v Speaker 3>give off this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

356
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.120
<v Speaker 3>this thing that lets me know exactly</v>
<v Speaker 3>where to go and you could kreskin did it</v>

357
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:37.760
<v Speaker 3>with his check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would hide the check and and before</v>

358
00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:41.210
<v Speaker 3>that polgar did it with his check and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done it with my check when I do</v>

359
00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:44.720
<v Speaker 3>shows in the past where they can hide</v>
<v Speaker 3>your check anywhere in the theater.</v>

360
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.440
<v Speaker 3>You take somebody's head and you tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>them to think of my other hand and they</v>

361
00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:51.590
<v Speaker 3>have to know where the objects hidden</v>
<v Speaker 3>and think of that hand actually going</v>

362
00:15:51.591 --> 00:15:54.320
<v Speaker 3>there and touching it and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually find the object.</v>

363
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:57.250
<v Speaker 3>So I was doing a lot of muscle reading</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in those days and everybody.</v>

364
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.690
<v Speaker 3>What about you get some stone cold</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychopath?</v>

365
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:00.540
<v Speaker 3>Not No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>

366
00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.910
<v Speaker 3>They have to really truly be thinking it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and wanting it to happen and that's why</v>

367
00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:08.690
<v Speaker 3>I reframe it in the aspect of you see me</v>
<v Speaker 3>do things with my mind.</v>

368
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.640
<v Speaker 3>I want you to try and do something with</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind.</v>

369
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:15.670
<v Speaker 3>Will this hand to actually touch that</v>
<v Speaker 3>object so they do and they don't realize</v>

370
00:16:15.981 --> 00:16:19.310
<v Speaker 3>that subtly there pushing and pulling</v>
<v Speaker 3>you in the right direction and you can</v>

371
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:20.740
<v Speaker 3>even say them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't pull me in the direction.</v>

372
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.090
<v Speaker 3>Let me pull you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're still pulling and pushing</v>

373
00:16:23.091 --> 00:16:24.740
<v Speaker 3>with them and you can find the actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>logic.</v>

374
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.320
<v Speaker 3>And so I wrote a book on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called psychophysiological thought,</v>

375
00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:30.910
<v Speaker 3>reading psychophysiological</v>
<v Speaker 3>physiological reading,</v>

376
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.870
<v Speaker 3>lot reading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is isolating.</v>

377
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.480
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I did was we call it bustle,</v>

378
00:16:35.481 --> 00:16:38.540
<v Speaker 3>reading in the business and in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

379
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:40.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I started looking at some of the</v>

380
00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:43.520
<v Speaker 3>older terms for it and I found that term</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychophysiological thought reading.</v>

381
00:16:43.521 --> 00:16:47.060
<v Speaker 3>I thought that's a great name for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>book because every book I've written on</v>

382
00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:49.220
<v Speaker 3>mentalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I write books that teach people</v>

383
00:16:49.221 --> 00:16:52.940
<v Speaker 3>and video I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all start with a pea size series,</v>

384
00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:53.471
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

385
00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:53.931
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

386
00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:56.210
<v Speaker 3>So it's all I've talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

387
00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.440
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to penn about magic and</v>
<v Speaker 3>about illusions and,</v>

388
00:17:00.441 --> 00:17:01.310
<v Speaker 3>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

389
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:06.000
<v Speaker 3>funny about it and he laughs and says</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all lies and bullshit and you know,</v>

390
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.870
<v Speaker 3>he makes it seem fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way you described it,</v>

391
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:12.160
<v Speaker 3>it became a little bit more compelling</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're,</v>

392
00:17:12.161 --> 00:17:14.150
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seemingly obsessed with it.</v>

393
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:19.580
<v Speaker 3>Like obviously to get as good as you got</v>
<v Speaker 3>at becoming a mentalist like you,</v>

394
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:22.310
<v Speaker 3>you had to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the way that you rattle off things</v>

395
00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:24.650
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's very little pause to you.</v>

396
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.970
<v Speaker 3>You stop and start and I talk too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know everybody says you talk.</v>

397
00:17:28.971 --> 00:17:31.220
<v Speaker 3>We don't talk too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just talk fast.</v>

398
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can hear you.</v>

399
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.360
<v Speaker 3>It's very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's also what I noticed when you</v>

400
00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:38.000
<v Speaker 3>were doing the reading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we did it in front of the crowd of</v>

401
00:17:38.001 --> 00:17:42.980
<v Speaker 3>people and you were able to pick out</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things that didn't make the air</v>

402
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.530
<v Speaker 3>because it didn't fit the format of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>show at that time.</v>

403
00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:46.500
<v Speaker 3>One of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

404
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.520
<v Speaker 3>what Joe Joe's talking about is there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a part in the show where I ask people</v>

405
00:17:50.521 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 3>just to think of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

406
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:56.190
<v Speaker 3>and then I start getting initials and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I get names and then I get,</v>

407
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:56.851
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

408
00:17:56.851 --> 00:17:58.650
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually thinking about your</v>

409
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:03.400
<v Speaker 3>grandmother and how you went on a bike</v>
<v Speaker 3>ride with her through certain forests.</v>

410
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.260
<v Speaker 3>Then went to Lake Chelan pull pack and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your birth date is this and that.</v>

411
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 3>And I did a birthday freaking stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

412
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:10.254
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

413
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.910
<v Speaker 3>But it was the weirdest thing is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

414
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:17.130
<v Speaker 3>they're also overwhelmed by the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you never stopped talking like it</v>

415
00:18:17.131 --> 00:18:18.710
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just ready go pro.</v>

416
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.480
<v Speaker 3>It just keeps coming like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh,</v>

417
00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.990
<v Speaker 3>how do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

418
00:18:21.991 --> 00:18:22.500
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

419
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.970
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll get that to the minute,</v>

420
00:18:23.971 --> 00:18:24.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where that comes from.</v>

421
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:27.440
<v Speaker 3>Jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That comes from back in my early days I,</v>

422
00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:28.310
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

423
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:29.760
<v Speaker 3>well in the very beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well let's,</v>

424
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.410
<v Speaker 3>let's get you in with the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get to,</v>

425
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 3>I'll get to that to where I work the</v>
<v Speaker 3>places because that sort of comes from</v>

426
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:38.760
<v Speaker 3>working the comedy clubs and some really</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shitty shitty places and having to grab</v>

427
00:18:38.761 --> 00:18:40.060
<v Speaker 3>people's attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

428
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 3>so from there I ended up writing randy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and letter a just out of the blue</v>

429
00:18:45.181 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 3>because I was getting a little cocky I</v>
<v Speaker 3>guess at young,</v>

430
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:48.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that age because I was getting away with</v>

431
00:18:48.871 --> 00:18:49.540
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff.</v>

432
00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.580
<v Speaker 3>And Randy let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

433
00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:51.900
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ever need a kid to try to</v>

434
00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:54.060
<v Speaker 3>convince scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff is real,</v>

435
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:58.260
<v Speaker 3>I would be happy to so long as I come</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and say it's a hoax at the very end.</v>

436
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.890
<v Speaker 3>I had a couple of hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

437
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 3>and one of them was at scientists</v>
<v Speaker 3>implemented for years.</v>

438
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:06.780
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence of the esp on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>proper scientific controls.</v>

439
00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:09.270
<v Speaker 3>And this is back in the eighties because</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lack of funding,</v>

440
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.450
<v Speaker 3>it was my contention had nothing to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>with funding.</v>

441
00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:15.210
<v Speaker 3>You have to do with the scientists were</v>
<v Speaker 3>going with the pro biased opinion and</v>

442
00:19:15.211 --> 00:19:18.240
<v Speaker 3>they would documenting their own beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than using proper science.</v>

443
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.030
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to find out if it was even genuine.</v>

444
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.480
<v Speaker 3>So they were not using the proper</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific method.</v>

445
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.820
<v Speaker 3>They would basically just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe this is real.</v>

446
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get it on tape or I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get it to where I can document it.</v>

447
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.170
<v Speaker 3>So the rest of the world that slowly</v>
<v Speaker 3>down where they biased towards believing</v>

448
00:19:34.171 --> 00:19:36.840
<v Speaker 3>that it was real or fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no believing it was real.</v>

449
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.180
<v Speaker 3>Because you don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually you don't get into Paris</v>

450
00:19:39.181 --> 00:19:41.970
<v Speaker 3>psychology unless you have an interest</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it and usually you don't have an</v>

451
00:19:41.971 --> 00:19:43.830
<v Speaker 3>interest in it unless you think there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>something there.</v>

452
00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do those ghost shows drive you fucking</v>

453
00:19:46.381 --> 00:19:47.220
<v Speaker 3>crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

454
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:49.650
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I know I've actually been.</v>

455
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.250
<v Speaker 3>I've actually been called to work on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of them behind the scenes that I</v>

456
00:19:53.251 --> 00:19:54.031
<v Speaker 3>always tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

457
00:19:54.031 --> 00:19:56.550
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have some friends that have worked</v>

458
00:19:56.551 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 3>on them behind the scenes to try to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the investigators freak and</v>

459
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:03.780
<v Speaker 3>they're using magic tricks to get the</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigators freak and the great thing</v>

460
00:20:03.781 --> 00:20:07.290
<v Speaker 3>about those kinds of shows is you only</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to do one little thing,</v>

461
00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:09.570
<v Speaker 3>just something falling off a shelf</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it just.</v>

462
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.830
<v Speaker 3>That's all you need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

463
00:20:10.831 --> 00:20:11.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

464
00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:15.520
<v Speaker 3>there's a ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It fell off the shelf because they play</v>

465
00:20:15.521 --> 00:20:19.140
<v Speaker 3>that tape over and over and over again</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they show a little shadow or</v>

466
00:20:19.141 --> 00:20:21.210
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing dumber on television</v>

467
00:20:21.211 --> 00:20:23.760
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now and and smarter than I know for a</v>

468
00:20:23.761 --> 00:20:25.710
<v Speaker 3>fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people that work behind them,</v>

469
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.680
<v Speaker 3>behind those scenes at fooling those</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

470
00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:30.520
<v Speaker 3>When we work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I work with Chris Angel a lot.</v>

471
00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

472
00:20:31.561 --> 00:20:34.740
<v Speaker 3>the early days I worked with him on</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost all of his EPA shows.</v>

473
00:20:34.741 --> 00:20:39.390
<v Speaker 3>I've done over a 100 episodes of</v>
<v Speaker 3>television with Chris and we,</v>

474
00:20:39.391 --> 00:20:42.930
<v Speaker 3>every year we would do one episode that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a silence episode,</v>

475
00:20:42.931 --> 00:20:45.120
<v Speaker 3>that type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

476
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.390
<v Speaker 3>we brought a group of researchers in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moment they got off the bus,</v>

477
00:20:49.391 --> 00:20:52.330
<v Speaker 3>we had all this stuff set up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else to mess with them.</v>

478
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.410
<v Speaker 3>The moment they got off the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told my guys,</v>

479
00:20:54.411 --> 00:20:55.860
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not using any of that which is</v>

480
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 3>going to use pure psychology with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

481
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.530
<v Speaker 3>And that's what happened because I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell they was,</v>

482
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 3>they was such believable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything I suggest to them they're going</v>

483
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:09.040
<v Speaker 3>to go for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say we have six rooms and I</v>

484
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:14.041
<v Speaker 3>need this one room to be the room that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is haunted because that's a story that</v>

485
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:18.010
<v Speaker 3>goes on behind it with something else</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's already been said and position or</v>

486
00:21:18.011 --> 00:21:20.740
<v Speaker 3>it's got to match up with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrities who feels something in the</v>

487
00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:24.340
<v Speaker 3>room as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I gotta do is once we go in to,</v>

488
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fill anything,</v>

489
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.410
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel a little haunting.</v>

490
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I feel this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

491
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.890
<v Speaker 3>this room I really want you to take time</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

492
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.180
<v Speaker 3>That's all I have to say.</v>

493
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.950
<v Speaker 3>And it's the psychics getting headaches</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just,</v>

494
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.340
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go crazy because I've already put</v>

495
00:21:36.341 --> 00:21:37.520
<v Speaker 3>it in their head at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

496
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.950
<v Speaker 3>So the stuff they come up with is going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be much more believable than any of</v>

497
00:21:41.951 --> 00:21:44.800
<v Speaker 3>the little tricks that we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like hidden recordings and stuff like</v>

498
00:21:44.801 --> 00:21:46.900
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stuff they come up with is going to</v>

499
00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:49.900
<v Speaker 3>be much more believable and much more of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hit.</v>

500
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Are there any real like supernatural</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigators that actually believe in</v>

501
00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:58.880
<v Speaker 3>ghosts or they all come?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People know there's people investigators</v>

502
00:21:58.881 --> 00:21:59.651
<v Speaker 3>that believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

503
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:00.720
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll show,</v>

504
00:22:00.721 --> 00:22:04.390
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They must know they're fucking think.</v>

505
00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

506
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:06.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

507
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.250
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A paranormal state was one of them,</v>

508
00:22:09.251 --> 00:22:09.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

509
00:22:09.901 --> 00:22:10.770
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

510
00:22:10.771 --> 00:22:13.270
<v Speaker 3>some of them are a little abusive too</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they work with little kids</v>

511
00:22:13.271 --> 00:22:16.700
<v Speaker 3>sometimes and they talk the kids into</v>
<v Speaker 3>believing these things and,</v>

512
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.450
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just,</v>

513
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.510
<v Speaker 3>some of them are a little bit.</v>

514
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a little creepy little creepy</v>

515
00:22:21.221 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 3>what they do to them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they usually don't have a psychologist</v>

516
00:22:24.161 --> 00:22:28.030
<v Speaker 3>taking care of the people afterwards to</v>
<v Speaker 3>work them through it and it's just,</v>

517
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:32.260
<v Speaker 3>it's the psychologist I do is also a</v>
<v Speaker 3>paranormal investigator that believes in</v>

518
00:22:32.261 --> 00:22:35.380
<v Speaker 3>these kinds of things and it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>come at it a very slanted angle.</v>

519
00:22:35.381 --> 00:22:39.610
<v Speaker 3>So I've not seen a single one of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows that I don't look at it and go</v>

520
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.270
<v Speaker 3>bullshit and just end up turning it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

521
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.190
<v Speaker 3>Now did they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

522
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.790
<v Speaker 3>but is there anybody who like</v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimately,</v>

523
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.050
<v Speaker 3>like anybody who's a reasonable person</v>
<v Speaker 3>who legitimately believes in ghosts and</v>

524
00:22:53.051 --> 00:22:56.920
<v Speaker 3>legitimately believes in every movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every haunt horror movie.</v>

525
00:22:56.921 --> 00:23:01.690
<v Speaker 3>There's always like this one real</v>
<v Speaker 3>researcher that there are people like</v>

526
00:23:01.691 --> 00:23:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Lloyd Lloyd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alabama,</v>

527
00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.080
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who I know is he believes in this kind</v>

528
00:23:05.081 --> 00:23:05.914
<v Speaker 3>of stuff too.</v>

529
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.050
<v Speaker 3>And you have a tumor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

530
00:23:08.051 --> 00:23:11.710
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have a tumor</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as I know.</v>

531
00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:13.010
<v Speaker 3>He does not have it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A nice.</v>

532
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.250
<v Speaker 3>He's a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I respect a lot of these guys.</v>

533
00:23:15.251 --> 00:23:17.350
<v Speaker 3>I get along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to,</v>

534
00:23:17.351 --> 00:23:18.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you've got to be at a debate</v>

535
00:23:18.911 --> 00:23:20.980
<v Speaker 3>with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to be able to talk to them and</v>

536
00:23:20.981 --> 00:23:24.460
<v Speaker 3>if you show them respect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to show you reason with</v>

537
00:23:24.461 --> 00:23:28.620
<v Speaker 3>them and sort of explain why what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing is faulty or we,</v>

538
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:29.440
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>

539
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.870
<v Speaker 3>we have conversations about certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

540
00:23:31.871 --> 00:23:33.370
<v Speaker 3>certain type of testing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

541
00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:34.204
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how,</v>

542
00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.380
<v Speaker 3>how ridiculous some of these things are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

543
00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:37.370
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

544
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.280
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be convinced that</v>

545
00:23:39.281 --> 00:23:41.620
<v Speaker 3>there's something there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's a little little something</v>

546
00:23:41.621 --> 00:23:44.680
<v Speaker 3>like one little thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't quite knock out a way where</v>

547
00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.553
<v Speaker 3>they can do.</v>

548
00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like when I worked with a pat,</v>

549
00:23:46.971 --> 00:23:50.780
<v Speaker 3>so back then Washington University in</v>
<v Speaker 3>1979,</v>

550
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:53.500
<v Speaker 3>James McDonald gave a half million</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars to washing university.</v>

551
00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:56.080
<v Speaker 3>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was shortly after I had wrote</v>

552
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:59.110
<v Speaker 3>Randy that let him and now James</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mcdonald,</v>

553
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.360
<v Speaker 3>he was Mcdonald aircraft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

554
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the banshee and all those different</v>

555
00:24:03.201 --> 00:24:05.030
<v Speaker 3>types are all named after spirits by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

556
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

557
00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.000
<v Speaker 3>So if you take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do your research,</v>

558
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.970
<v Speaker 3>you'll find all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he really truly believed in,</v>

559
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.590
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the afterlife.</v>

560
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.760
<v Speaker 3>And His thinking was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

561
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.760
<v Speaker 3>if they can find something that's even</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychic,</v>

562
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:19.340
<v Speaker 3>that might be indicative that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an afterlife,</v>

563
00:24:19.341 --> 00:24:20.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least it's indicative that something</v>

564
00:24:20.871 --> 00:24:23.660
<v Speaker 3>supernatural paranormal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are things we don't understand.</v>

565
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.150
<v Speaker 3>So we gave half a million dollars</v>
<v Speaker 3>washing university,</v>

566
00:24:26.151 --> 00:24:29.150
<v Speaker 3>the form of a laboratory called the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mcdonald Mcdonald Laboratory for</v>

567
00:24:29.151 --> 00:24:31.310
<v Speaker 3>psychical research short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we call it Mac lab,</v>

568
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.640
<v Speaker 3>a Peter Phillips there had an interest</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Paris psychology,</v>

569
00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:36.230
<v Speaker 3>but really didn't want to get involved.</v>

570
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.490
<v Speaker 3>But the university said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

571

576
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.850
<v Speaker 3>and out of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sent them a letter out of all the</v>

577
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:55.850
<v Speaker 3>applicants they had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was only two that were accepted.</v>

578
00:24:55.851 --> 00:24:57.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did some research with other people</v>

579
00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:01.220
<v Speaker 3>there too that they really accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was myself and another kid that I</v>

580
00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:03.410
<v Speaker 3>didn't know at the time by the name of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Edwards.</v>

581
00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

582
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.730
<v Speaker 3>Michael turned out to be a magician as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

583
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.030
<v Speaker 3>And he had also spoke to randy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I get a call.</v>

584
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.210
<v Speaker 3>I said that there was an associated</v>
<v Speaker 3>press article that came out and that's</v>

585
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.880
<v Speaker 3>when I wrote to them and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

586
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:18.380
<v Speaker 3>we'd like to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd like you to come visit.</v>

587
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.840
<v Speaker 3>I get a call from randy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

588
00:25:20.841 --> 00:25:23.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this guy at Washington</v>

589
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.710
<v Speaker 3>University,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was being given half a million</v>

590
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.350
<v Speaker 3>dollars to study psychic phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

591
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.280
<v Speaker 3>can you just think of his initials for</v>
<v Speaker 3>me?</v>

592
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.290
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a p and a p?</v>

593
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.101
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did you know?</v>

594
00:25:31.101 --> 00:25:32.270
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've already been accepted,</v>

595
00:25:32.271 --> 00:25:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I was going to let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he started telling me about Mike,</v>

596
00:25:35.421 --> 00:25:38.330
<v Speaker 3>that Mike had already been there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike had been to key in their hands.</v>

597
00:25:38.331 --> 00:25:41.420
<v Speaker 3>They were completely convinced that this</v>
<v Speaker 3>was real psychic phenomena,</v>

598
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.300
<v Speaker 3>but at that point Mike wasn't quite sure</v>
<v Speaker 3>where to take it.</v>

599
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.330
<v Speaker 3>And he knew randy was the expert at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunker in the field because randy had</v>

600
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:49.340
<v Speaker 3>the debunk geller and other psychic</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon.</v>

601
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.380
<v Speaker 3>So he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he spoke with Randy on the phone and,</v>

602
00:25:52.381 --> 00:25:55.820
<v Speaker 3>and I wrote to randy as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they had some conversations and I</v>

603
00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:56.481
<v Speaker 3>said to randy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

604
00:25:56.481 --> 00:25:57.380
<v Speaker 3>can I trust Mike?</v>

605
00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.750
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about him to trust</v>

606
00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:02.390
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Mike had the same concerns about me</v>

607
00:26:02.391 --> 00:26:04.040
<v Speaker 3>because randy had mentioned me to him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and said,</v>

608
00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:06.530
<v Speaker 3>you should mention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what my real name is Stephen</v>

609
00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Shaw.</v>

610
00:26:08.931 --> 00:26:10.520
<v Speaker 3>years later because people couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember.</v>

611
00:26:10.521 --> 00:26:13.870
<v Speaker 3>Stephen Shaw think you remember a check</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the.</v>

612
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.650
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

629
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.870

00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:53.510
<v Speaker 3>I forgot my name please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

631
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.800
<v Speaker 3>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my name is Stephen [inaudible].</v>

632
00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:55.451
<v Speaker 3>Stephen Shaw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>

634
00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.630
<v Speaker 3>He's done this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's done that.</v>

635
00:26:57.631 --> 00:26:59.150
<v Speaker 3>He's on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please welcome Steven.</v>

636
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.440
<v Speaker 3>What was the last name again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Crap.</v>

637
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.980
<v Speaker 3>It happened to me or third time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I started thinking about why is</v>

638
00:27:04.981 --> 00:27:08.040
<v Speaker 3>this happening and how can I fix this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

639
00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:09.820
<v Speaker 3>one way to fix it probably I think back</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

640
00:27:09.821 --> 00:27:10.590
<v Speaker 3>is just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

641
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.900
<v Speaker 3>read my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't even memorize it,</v>

642
00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:16.620
<v Speaker 3>just read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Stephen is such a common name and</v>

643
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:19.860
<v Speaker 3>Shaw is such a common name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's really no real hard syllables.</v>

644
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 3>And then except for maybe the team at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the va a little bit,</v>

645
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:24.480
<v Speaker 3>but not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a soft syllable so it kind of</v>

646
00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:27.570
<v Speaker 3>passes right through the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're thinking so much about</v>

647
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.960
<v Speaker 3>everything else they want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

648
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.070
<v Speaker 3>cnn live the today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>show this and that.</v>

649
00:27:32.071 --> 00:27:34.110
<v Speaker 3>I've seen in their story that they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to tell them everything.</v>

650
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.860
<v Speaker 3>So by the time they get to my name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they haven't really thought about my</v>

651
00:27:37.861 --> 00:27:42.570
<v Speaker 3>name or memorize my name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wanted a name that had at least two</v>

652
00:27:42.571 --> 00:27:45.660
<v Speaker 3>hearts syllables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that would stick in the brain.</v>

653
00:27:45.661 --> 00:27:47.850
<v Speaker 3>And I wanted a one word name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a two word name,</v>

654
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.800
<v Speaker 3>one word name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a rapper.</v>

655
00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:51.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

656
00:27:51.481 --> 00:27:55.570
<v Speaker 3>But this is before I'm dating myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was a real wrap prepared.</v>

657
00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.740
<v Speaker 3>That's it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So C,</v>

658
00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:58.231
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>
<v Speaker 3>e,</v>

659
00:27:58.231 --> 00:28:00.150
<v Speaker 3>k right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I loved that show.</v>

660
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:04.550
<v Speaker 3>He was at insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a detective and was that show on?</v>

661
00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was only one season,</v>

662
00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:07.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm not mistaken,</v>

663
00:28:07.711 --> 00:28:09.590
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you look that up on it,</v>

664
00:28:09.591 --> 00:28:11.190
<v Speaker 3>but I think it was asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Susan right here.</v>

665
00:28:11.191 --> 00:28:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Season one</v>
<v Speaker 3>season.</v>

666
00:28:13.621 --> 00:28:16.410
<v Speaker 3>That was a great show because he always</v>
<v Speaker 3>had these great Polish sayings that</v>

667
00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:18.510
<v Speaker 3>meant absolutely nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was just.</v>

668
00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:19.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

669
00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:20.154
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

670
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.460
<v Speaker 3>Very charismatic in that show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

671
00:28:22.461 --> 00:28:24.840
<v Speaker 3>the way he sold it was almost like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>magic trick.</v>

672
00:28:24.841 --> 00:28:27.510
<v Speaker 3>It was like they put the statue on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>truck,</v>

673
00:28:27.511 --> 00:28:31.910
<v Speaker 3>the truck arrives and it goes all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way across the United States and no</v>

674
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.210
<v Speaker 3>statue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where did it go?</v>

675
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.030
<v Speaker 3>It turns out that what they actually put</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the truck,</v>

676
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.330
<v Speaker 3>they thought it was a statute because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was covered and it was in this crate,</v>

677
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:40.620
<v Speaker 3>but it was a block of ice.</v>

678
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.900
<v Speaker 3>So by the time it got there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had already been switched out.</v>

679
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.610
<v Speaker 3>By the time it got there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had melted.</v>

680
00:28:44.611 --> 00:28:46.890
<v Speaker 3>So it's sort of magic in its own way as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

681
00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:50.040
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was sort of kindred spirits in a way</v>

682
00:28:50.041 --> 00:28:52.110
<v Speaker 3>to that and I love the name band check</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

683
00:28:52.111 --> 00:28:55.230
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I use banner check the way it's spelt</v>

684
00:28:55.231 --> 00:28:57.440
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they going to say Ben Sec.</v>

685
00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.900
<v Speaker 3>And so I put B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a c,</v>

686
00:29:00.901 --> 00:29:01.561
<v Speaker 3>h,</v>
<v Speaker 3>e k,</v>

687
00:29:01.561 --> 00:29:04.140
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to put an extra seat at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end because then it becomes bounced</v>

688
00:29:04.141 --> 00:29:06.600
<v Speaker 3>a check or something stupid like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

689
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.650
<v Speaker 3>I get banana check,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get bonus check,</v>

690
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get all these things but,</v>

691
00:29:10.171 --> 00:29:11.520
<v Speaker 3>but at least here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

692
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.720
<v Speaker 3>So the old time is back then the ceos of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the company,</v>

693
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:19.020
<v Speaker 3>the presidents of the company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they remember the TV show,</v>

694
00:29:19.021 --> 00:29:22.590
<v Speaker 3>they may make fun of me at first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're going to remember the name</v>

695
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.860
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They now associate it with me because</v>

696
00:29:25.861 --> 00:29:28.410
<v Speaker 3>I've blown their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they don't know it,</v>

697
00:29:28.411 --> 00:29:30.600
<v Speaker 3>they've got to come up to me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you pronounce that?</v>

698
00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:33.810
<v Speaker 3>So they're thinking about my name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never had a problem since.</v>

699
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:35.840
<v Speaker 3>So there's the old TV show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>banner check,</v>

700
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:39.480
<v Speaker 3>but the way I spell it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a grey hound a,</v>

701
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:41.300
<v Speaker 3>there was a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

702
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 3>there was a band called</v>

703
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.650
<v Speaker 2>a check and there was a construction</v>
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

704
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Now the construction company owned the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bank check earl,</v>

705
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:48.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the website,</v>

706
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.770
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't do anything with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

707
00:29:50.771 --> 00:29:53.980
<v Speaker 2>And this is back before you could do</v>
<v Speaker 2>automatic payments,</v>

708
00:29:53.981 --> 00:29:56.530
<v Speaker 2>like it just goes every year</v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically for you.</v>

709
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.530
<v Speaker 2>So I would sit there every year just</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting on that all every day,</v>

710
00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:01.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I knew it was going to go up and I</v>

711
00:30:01.361 --> 00:30:03.850
<v Speaker 2>finally got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I get after three years of it just</v>

712
00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:05.350
<v Speaker 2>sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I finally was able to get it.</v>

713
00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:07.270
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

714
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:08.980
<v Speaker 2>that's my name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I got my name.</v>

715
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So go back to this Michael Edwards.</v>

716
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.030
<v Speaker 2>So Mike Edwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

717
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I go off on these weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do this all the time.</v>

718
00:30:19.991 --> 00:30:23.110
<v Speaker 2>I go off on so many different tangents</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's so many different stories</v>

719
00:30:23.111 --> 00:30:24.340
<v Speaker 2>and so many different directions I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

720
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.660
<v Speaker 2>So with Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

721
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.690
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'll find that out in my life.</v>

722
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:32.320
<v Speaker 2>There is so much psychology applied to</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday life for me,</v>

723
00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:34.150
<v Speaker 2>like the name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did I choose my name?</v>

724
00:30:34.151 --> 00:30:36.880
<v Speaker 2>There was a reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say it's not just haphazard and</v>

725
00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:39.670
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or sometimes it's just a joke.</v>

726
00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

727
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.340
<v Speaker 2>I get really sarcastic sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me here.</v>

728
00:30:42.341 --> 00:30:43.390
<v Speaker 2>I go off on another tangent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

729
00:30:43.391 --> 00:30:44.560
<v Speaker 2>let's go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

730
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.720
<v Speaker 2>so here I am with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

731
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.090
<v Speaker 2>brandy telling me about them in it and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

732
00:30:49.091 --> 00:30:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've already been accepted.</v>

733
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Mike and I are supposed to show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

734
00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.400
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody recently bought my Barry</v>

735
00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Sonnenfeld had bought my light life</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights with because of this whole thing,</v>

736
00:31:00.671 --> 00:31:03.100
<v Speaker 2>which is called project Alpha that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling you the story about now.</v>

737
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.850
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had bought it and wanted a Aaron</v>

738
00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Sorkin to write it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is way back then.</v>

739
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is now like not so long.</v>

740
00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:13.210
<v Speaker 2>A couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>following up with your timeline,</v>

741
00:31:13.211 --> 00:31:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I know Aaron was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aaron was.</v>

742
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Aaron was busy so he couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

743
00:31:18.871 --> 00:31:21.100
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when he wasn't busy,</v>

744
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Barry got busy in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rights.</v>

745
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.060
<v Speaker 2>What they had were basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

746
00:31:25.061 --> 00:31:27.640
<v Speaker 2>ran out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've taken it now and I'm working</v>

747
00:31:27.641 --> 00:31:30.880
<v Speaker 2>with another production company to do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>series on what we're talking about right</v>

748
00:31:30.881 --> 00:31:31.211
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

749
00:31:31.211 --> 00:31:32.320
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here I am,</v>

750
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm with Mike Edwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We show up at the airport in St Louis.</v>

751
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:38.470
<v Speaker 2>First Time we get to meet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we meet each other,</v>

752
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.580
<v Speaker 2>we hit it off right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have my driver's license.</v>

753
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.120
<v Speaker 2>I had some form informed idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it for my id.</v>

754
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I had some of the former Id,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

755
00:31:46.001 --> 00:31:46.834
<v Speaker 2>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

756
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.240
<v Speaker 2>he had his and he could drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just got his at the time.</v>

757
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.280
<v Speaker 2>So I wonder if I use my password then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

758
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing,</v>

759
00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.340
<v Speaker 2>you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fast talking thing.</v>

760
00:31:54.341 --> 00:31:56.290
<v Speaker 2>This is part of the shuck and jive</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

761
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.420
<v Speaker 2>This is a little bit of me but as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

762
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.910
<v Speaker 2>but it also is very effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a shuck and jive artist</v>

763
00:32:02.911 --> 00:32:05.470
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They talk very fast and they never</v>

764
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.380
<v Speaker 2>pause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you never get a chance to interject</v>

765
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:12.940
<v Speaker 2>and they're constantly going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they're reading euro or saying</v>

766
00:32:12.941 --> 00:32:15.430
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to keep up with them and part</v>

767
00:32:15.431 --> 00:32:19.000
<v Speaker 2>of the keeping up with them as you get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little Bit Wilderness and bewildered,</v>

768
00:32:19.001 --> 00:32:23.950
<v Speaker 2>you forget what you've said or they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>said and you're trying to sort of keep</v>

769
00:32:23.951 --> 00:32:26.120
<v Speaker 2>pace with them and you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And next thing you know,</v>

770
00:32:26.121 --> 00:32:26.861
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

771
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you figure that out?</v>

772
00:32:28.991 --> 00:32:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get to that later and then you</v>

773
00:32:30.461 --> 00:32:33.610
<v Speaker 2>keep going and you keep as part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment aspect of it.</v>

774
00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:35.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not what I'm doing right now</v>

775
00:32:35.141 --> 00:32:37.330
<v Speaker 2>because they're sharp as when he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>

776
00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.380
<v Speaker 2>he would put a piece on you you couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep with,</v>

777
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:40.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

778
00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.620
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you always analyze it with fighting,</v>

779
00:32:42.621 --> 00:32:45.470
<v Speaker 2>which is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of that thing.</v>

780
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Vulnerabilities and exploit</v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerabilities in the human mind.</v>

781
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:51.050
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them is that you talk and think</v>

782
00:32:51.051 --> 00:32:54.110
<v Speaker 2>faster than most people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So most people when you're talking,</v>

783
00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.520
<v Speaker 2>they don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

784
00:32:55.521 --> 00:32:58.880
<v Speaker 2>You just did right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to get a chance to interject</v>

785
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.510
<v Speaker 2>because I'm gonna keep talking and as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep talking I talk quicker and you get</v>

786
00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:04.130
<v Speaker 2>bewildered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that you do to</v>

787
00:33:04.131 --> 00:33:05.390
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you realize it or not,</v>

788
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.300
<v Speaker 2>you do it because you've done it that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way for a long time.</v>

789
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:11.480
<v Speaker 2>It's probably become a pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has become a pattern to make the other</v>

790
00:33:11.481 --> 00:33:14.600
<v Speaker 2>person feel unsecure so you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're paying for.</v>

791
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:19.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a patent for me being able to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not forget things as I'm saying them</v>

792
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.070
<v Speaker 2>like because like as you so effective</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you said that.</v>

793
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.200
<v Speaker 2>There is another thing that popped in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my.</v>

794
00:33:24.201 --> 00:33:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I got like all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have songs in my head.</v>

795
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.790
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

796
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I do this with my teeth all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Playing the music in my head like</v>

797
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.690
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm not thinking about anything else,</v>

798
00:33:35.691 --> 00:33:37.820
<v Speaker 2>I have songs in my head constantly and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've even.</v>

799
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:39.470
<v Speaker 2>I went to the dentist and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

800
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.870
<v Speaker 2>I've got this thing with my teeth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tapping my teeth.</v>

801
00:33:41.871 --> 00:33:43.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm wearing him down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what's going on?</v>

802
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.050
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

803
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.910
<v Speaker 2>musicians do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

804
00:33:46.911 --> 00:33:49.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always have music 24 hours a day in my</v>

805
00:33:49.341 --> 00:33:50.250
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So wow.</v>

806
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.620
<v Speaker 2>But now I've gone off somewhere and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>would say,</v>

807
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:52.483
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the handwriting.</v>

808
00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.640
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look my hand writing how bad my head,</v>

809
00:33:55.641 --> 00:33:57.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's really hard to freaking read.</v>

810
00:33:57.651 --> 00:33:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not that bad.</v>

811
00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Somebody just wrote me a letter and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>read the letter.</v>

812
00:34:02.281 --> 00:34:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend of mine sent me something.</v>

813
00:34:03.891 --> 00:34:05.630
<v Speaker 2>He wrote me a letter and I've read his</v>
<v Speaker 2>letter.</v>

814
00:34:05.631 --> 00:34:07.310
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what the fuck is that?</v>

815
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.820
<v Speaker 2>Because it's just scribbled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's me writing neat.</v>

816
00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.200
<v Speaker 2>So slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So slow.</v>

817
00:34:12.201 --> 00:34:14.150
<v Speaker 2>Normally when I write I can't read it</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

818
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the thing,</v>

819
00:34:15.801 --> 00:34:17.230
<v Speaker 2>what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

820
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.413
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

821
00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.210
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to keep up with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>

822
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things about bad</v>

823
00:34:22.101 --> 00:34:23.870
<v Speaker 2>handwriting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say that you're trying to keep up</v>

824
00:34:23.871 --> 00:34:27.830
<v Speaker 2>with what you're thinking and learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always going a mile a minute.</v>

825
00:34:27.831 --> 00:34:31.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a thousand different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's part of my problem</v>

826
00:34:31.731 --> 00:34:34.640
<v Speaker 2>solving is like when people give me</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas that they want,</v>

827
00:34:34.641 --> 00:34:36.350
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'd like to do as a magic</v>

828
00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:37.070
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>

829
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:39.620
<v Speaker 2>How do I do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to rattle off like 10,</v>

830
00:34:39.621 --> 00:34:43.700
<v Speaker 2>15 different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like as a mentalist that way</v>

831
00:34:43.701 --> 00:34:46.190
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pattern of talking is so</v>

832
00:34:46.191 --> 00:34:47.960
<v Speaker 2>bewildering to people that they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like,</v>

833
00:34:47.961 --> 00:34:48.750
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

834
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:49.870
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

835
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:54.330
<v Speaker 2>And you've got them on the ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always is that thing of even in my state</v>

836
00:34:54.331 --> 00:34:56.490
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'll have to come to the state</v>

837
00:34:56.491 --> 00:34:57.324
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something I would love.</v>

838
00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.170
<v Speaker 2>I would love you to come see the mini</v>
<v Speaker 2>version of it.</v>

839
00:35:00.171 --> 00:35:02.030

<v Speaker 2>I was blown away.</v>

840
00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I do is I come out</v>

841
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.320
<v Speaker 2>before I don't even introduce myself.</v>

858
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm busy now really until I'm beginning</v>
<v Speaker 3>of November.</v>

859
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:48.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be like different places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just touring,</v>

860
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:50.760
<v Speaker 3>touring different places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of it's corporate,</v>

861
00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:52.110
<v Speaker 3>some of it's college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

862
00:35:52.111 --> 00:35:54.000
<v Speaker 3>it's a mixture of a mismatch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

863
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.120
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So go back to this whole James,</v>

864
00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:58.290
<v Speaker 3>Randy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uri Geller.</v>

865
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:02.160
<v Speaker 3>So here I am with a Mike Edwards at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>airport and we're hitting it off and</v>

866
00:36:02.161 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter Phillips shows up and he's the</v>

867
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:07.350
<v Speaker 3>professor that I mentioned a minute ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's going to be doing the</v>

868
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:12.120
<v Speaker 3>investigating of us and he has this</v>
<v Speaker 3>wristband on and I'm always asking</v>

869
00:36:12.121 --> 00:36:12.901
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's this,</v>

870
00:36:12.901 --> 00:36:14.640
<v Speaker 3>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm always noticing things and he</v>

871
00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:18.930
<v Speaker 3>said it was a wristband that he got from</v>
<v Speaker 3>a witch doctor in Africa that helps</v>

872
00:36:18.931 --> 00:36:21.630
<v Speaker 3>protect him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm starting to think this might be a</v>

873
00:36:21.631 --> 00:36:24.060
<v Speaker 3>little easier than I thought it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be going in.</v>

874
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:27.300
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know these guys skeptical.</v>

875
00:36:27.301 --> 00:36:28.800
<v Speaker 3>They give you these one way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mirrors.</v>

876
00:36:28.801 --> 00:36:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Are they gonna be trying to trick us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>catches.</v>

877
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:34.680
<v Speaker 3>I had no clue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we get into,</v>

878
00:36:34.681 --> 00:36:35.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>

879
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.210
<v Speaker 3>we had Peter Phillips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his car because Mike was too young to</v>

880
00:36:39.211 --> 00:36:41.310
<v Speaker 3>drive a rental.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter Phillips has at Rental Reynolds in</v>

881
00:36:41.311 --> 00:36:42.940
<v Speaker 3>front of us who were following him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>

882
00:36:42.941 --> 00:36:44.490
<v Speaker 3>this is how it all starts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

883
00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:48.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting there and just kind like be</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking all the time.</v>

884
00:36:48.871 --> 00:36:50.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always doing something.</v>

885
00:36:50.401 --> 00:36:52.980
<v Speaker 3>Always noticing something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look in the backseat and I noticed as</v>

886
00:36:52.981 --> 00:36:57.060
<v Speaker 3>a briefcase I reached in the back and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of pull it under the Dash.</v>

887
00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.910
<v Speaker 3>It's locked into me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if somebody locked something,</v>

888
00:36:59.911 --> 00:37:01.380
<v Speaker 3>it means they don't want you inside</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

889
00:37:01.381 --> 00:37:01.981
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

890
00:37:01.981 --> 00:37:05.160
<v Speaker 3>But why does anyone is in their old</v>
<v Speaker 3>briefcase easily.</v>

891
00:37:05.161 --> 00:37:06.090
<v Speaker 3>You can just open the locks.</v>

892
00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.130
<v Speaker 3>So I pick the locks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open it up inside.</v>

893
00:37:08.131 --> 00:37:11.370
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole bunch of silver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So either this guy's a Kleptomaniac or</v>

894
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.020
<v Speaker 3>this is a civil right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be using for the</v>

895
00:37:13.021 --> 00:37:14.640
<v Speaker 3>experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I stopped bending it all up,</v>

896
00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.890
<v Speaker 3>lock the briefcase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it in the back,</v>

897
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:21.450
<v Speaker 3>sit there for about two more minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open up the glove compartment,</v>

898
00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.730
<v Speaker 3>this extra keys and things in the glove</v>
<v Speaker 3>compartment.</v>

899
00:37:23.731 --> 00:37:27.030
<v Speaker 3>I stopped bidding those up instead his</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking keys.</v>

900
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.770
<v Speaker 3>I ha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm a psychic,</v>

901
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This stuff happens to those keys and</v>

902
00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.850
<v Speaker 3>getting his house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

903
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.570
<v Speaker 3>But I needed him to be convinced that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was genuine.</v>

904
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:40.320
<v Speaker 3>So I ended up looking over the car keys</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are hanging out,</v>

905
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:41.700
<v Speaker 3>the keys that are hanging out on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

906
00:37:41.701 --> 00:37:43.710
<v Speaker 3>Key out of the ignition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I start to reach over to get them.</v>

907
00:37:43.711 --> 00:37:46.170
<v Speaker 3>And Mike just looks at me and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you've done enough.</v>

908
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

909
00:37:47.281 --> 00:37:49.260
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's this really interesting</v>

910
00:37:49.261 --> 00:37:50.094
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

911
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:53.730
<v Speaker 3>We knew that in the laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything we did at that point was</v>

912
00:37:53.731 --> 00:37:56.550
<v Speaker 3>going to be on a micro level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be very small because it</v>

913
00:37:56.551 --> 00:37:59.820
<v Speaker 3>had to be because we couldn't make it</v>
<v Speaker 3>look like it's a trick.</v>

914
00:37:59.821 --> 00:38:03.600
<v Speaker 3>We had to look like my newt and not just</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

915
00:38:03.601 --> 00:38:05.560
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know if they were going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching it.</v>

916
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.080
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through one way mirrors and things like</v>

917
00:38:07.081 --> 00:38:09.210
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this interesting phenomenon at the</v>

918
00:38:09.211 --> 00:38:13.230
<v Speaker 3>time that was called spontaneous pk and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is stuff that just happened.</v>

919
00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.340
<v Speaker 3>Hey Pete psychokinesis PKA shorter for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sector cases,</v>

920
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:18.510
<v Speaker 3>telekinesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychokinesis,</v>

921
00:38:18.511 --> 00:38:19.590
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all have the same thing,</v>

922
00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:25.690
<v Speaker 3>so there's these things just supposedly</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened around these psychics that can</v>

923
00:38:25.801 --> 00:38:27.770
<v Speaker 3>bend metal stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moves,</v>

924
00:38:27.771 --> 00:38:31.890
<v Speaker 3>stuff breaks that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those things were the things that</v>

925
00:38:31.891 --> 00:38:34.470
<v Speaker 3>would convince him and keep him holding</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

926
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.570
<v Speaker 3>Even if we did a big band out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>laboratory but not on camera.</v>

927
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.720
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that would keep him</v>
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>

928
00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.810
<v Speaker 3>I want to get that on film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely want to get that on film.</v>

929
00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:46.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to document that someday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to happen in the</v>

930
00:38:46.421 --> 00:38:49.360
<v Speaker 3>laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we ended up getting to the</v>

931
00:38:49.361 --> 00:38:51.850
<v Speaker 3>laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the students at the university were</v>

932
00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:53.460
<v Speaker 3>extremely skeptical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

933
00:38:53.461 --> 00:38:55.660
<v Speaker 3>very skeptical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they had heard about the spontaneous</v>

934
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:58.720
<v Speaker 3>pk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they hit things under neath,</v>

935
00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:01.540
<v Speaker 3>the video recorders in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a separate room and they hit</v>

936
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:05.440
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of things everywhere around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I noticed there was stuff hidden.</v>

937
00:39:05.441 --> 00:39:06.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it recorded?</v>

938
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.020
<v Speaker 3>Had none of that VCR,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

939
00:39:08.021 --> 00:39:10.180
<v Speaker 3>why is there a fork hidden behind that</v>
<v Speaker 3>cupboard,</v>

940
00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't belong there.</v>

941
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:16.540
<v Speaker 3>So I started bending up all those things</v>
<v Speaker 3>on lunchtime and that convinced all the</v>

942
00:39:16.541 --> 00:39:19.330
<v Speaker 3>students that we were genuine as well.</v>

943
00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.293
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

944
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.941
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

945
00:39:21.941 --> 00:39:25.120
<v Speaker 3>this whole thing went on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a simple as.</v>

946
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:30.450
<v Speaker 3>So what happened was immediately randy</v>
<v Speaker 3>sent them a list of 13 caveats things</v>

947
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.010
<v Speaker 3>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they shouldn't do,</v>

948
00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.230
<v Speaker 3>and it was common sense stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

949
00:39:35.231 --> 00:39:38.380
<v Speaker 3>It was stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't let the subjects work at the same</v>

950
00:39:38.381 --> 00:39:41.770
<v Speaker 3>time because they could distract you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't let them work with more than one</v>

951
00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:45.070
<v Speaker 3>object at a time because they could</v>
<v Speaker 3>confuse you with those objects as to</v>

952
00:39:45.071 --> 00:39:48.070
<v Speaker 3>which ones you bending and there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole list of different things.</v>

953
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.180
<v Speaker 3>They showed the list to me and Mike and</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a good laugh about it and said,</v>

954
00:39:52.181 --> 00:39:54.100
<v Speaker 3>this would make you guys so</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable.</v>

955
00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:58.240
<v Speaker 3>We want you to be comfortable where in</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality they should have followed that</v>

956
00:39:58.241 --> 00:40:02.240
<v Speaker 3>list because one of the things randy</v>
<v Speaker 3>said was mark everything on a micro</v>

957
00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:07.260
<v Speaker 3>micro and a macro level so they the</v>
<v Speaker 3>subjects can see the macromark but won't</v>

958
00:40:07.631 --> 00:40:09.670
<v Speaker 3>realize as a micro mark on there as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

959
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:15.010
<v Speaker 3>which would have helped because their</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of doing a macro mark was on every</v>

960
00:40:15.011 --> 00:40:15.430
<v Speaker 3>fork.</v>

961
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.910
<v Speaker 3>They took the fork or spoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They measured it at both ends,</v>

962
00:40:18.911 --> 00:40:22.300
<v Speaker 3>like the height from the table and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>measured the middle of the four from the</v>

963
00:40:22.301 --> 00:40:25.240
<v Speaker 3>height from the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they put a label on it on a little</v>

964
00:40:25.241 --> 00:40:30.241
<v Speaker 3>string with a number on it and that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>her idea of keeping track of if</v>

965
00:40:30.371 --> 00:40:32.920
<v Speaker 3>something had bent on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not because they would measure it after</v>

966
00:40:32.921 --> 00:40:37.090
<v Speaker 3>we concentrated on it and they would</v>
<v Speaker 3>then remeasure it again afterwards and</v>

967
00:40:37.091 --> 00:40:37.721
<v Speaker 3>they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

968
00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:38.860
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a.</v>

969
00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:40.660
<v Speaker 3>This has been a millimeter or two</v>
<v Speaker 3>millimeters.</v>

970
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:43.540
<v Speaker 3>So we would do things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would say,</v>

971
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.220
<v Speaker 3>this tags in my way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I take it off?</v>

972
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:46.541
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can take it off.</v>

973
00:40:46.541 --> 00:40:48.250
<v Speaker 3>We put it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on it,</v>

974
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.560
<v Speaker 3>didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put it down on the table,</v>

975
00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.230
<v Speaker 3>pick up another fork or spoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>

976
00:40:53.231 --> 00:40:54.460
<v Speaker 3>do you mind if I remove this tag?</v>

977
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Take it off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it down,</v>

978
00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.430
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing happens.</v>

979
00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Switched the tags around on the one that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was on the first one to the second one,</v>

980
00:41:01.871 --> 00:41:05.650
<v Speaker 3>the second one of the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then put the two folks off to the</v>

981
00:41:05.651 --> 00:41:07.810
<v Speaker 3>side and then wait two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three hours later,</v>

982
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:11.380
<v Speaker 3>pick up one of those forks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously not doing anything with it.</v>

983
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:12.790
<v Speaker 3>Concentrating on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>

984
00:41:12.791 --> 00:41:15.160
<v Speaker 3>why don't you measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they would measure it and the</v>

985
00:41:15.161 --> 00:41:18.610
<v Speaker 3>measurements had now changed not</v>
<v Speaker 3>realizing because they never measured</v>

986
00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:21.730
<v Speaker 3>the other one again because I remembered</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything consistently later on and put</v>

987
00:41:21.731 --> 00:41:22.990
<v Speaker 3>new tires on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every single time,</v>

988
00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:27.700
<v Speaker 3>not realizing that we just simply</v>
<v Speaker 3>switched forks or as we reached across</v>

989
00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:29.740
<v Speaker 3>the table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would lean on one of the forks and</v>

990
00:41:29.741 --> 00:41:33.100
<v Speaker 3>then ours again later we would pretend</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we actually bought that for.</v>

991
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:34.430
<v Speaker 3>So this went on.</v>

992
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:37.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean it went on for 180 hours over</v>
<v Speaker 3>four years.</v>

993
00:41:37.881 --> 00:41:39.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we messed with these people bad.</v>

994
00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:42.260
<v Speaker 3>We did probably some things at the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were probably illegal as well,</v>

995
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.120
<v Speaker 3>like leaving the window unlocked at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>laboratory,</v>

996
00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:50.060
<v Speaker 3>going off to the club across the state</v>
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>

997
00:41:50.061 --> 00:41:52.550
<v Speaker 3>coming back like about four or 5:00 in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the morning,</v>

998
00:41:52.551 --> 00:41:56.840
<v Speaker 3>break it into the building and bending</v>
<v Speaker 3>up every single piece of metal that was</v>

999
00:41:56.841 --> 00:42:00.860
<v Speaker 3>in the laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a fucking scientists.</v>

1000
00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:02.360
<v Speaker 3>We're running this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1001
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:03.560
<v Speaker 3>this is back in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1002
00:42:03.561 --> 00:42:04.171
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

1003
00:42:04.171 --> 00:42:06.140
<v Speaker 3>they had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually had this aquarian back in</v>

1004
00:42:06.141 --> 00:42:08.530
<v Speaker 3>the 80 scientists were like eighties TV</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows.</v>

1005
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:11.110
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>

1006
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.260
<v Speaker 3>And here's the sad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1007
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:16.550
<v Speaker 3>I went into this thinking these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>were going to be the enemy.</v>

1008
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.960
<v Speaker 3>It was me against them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1009
00:42:17.961 --> 00:42:21.290
<v Speaker 3>I had to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turns out these are just really,</v>

1010
00:42:21.291 --> 00:42:24.410
<v Speaker 3>really nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice people that are very naive when it</v>

1011
00:42:24.411 --> 00:42:27.200
<v Speaker 3>comes to what psychic phenomena as well.</v>

1012
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.830
<v Speaker 3>If you're a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely you're not studying a whole</v>

1013
00:42:30.831 --> 00:42:35.831
<v Speaker 3>lot of liars and mentalist magicians and</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychic phenomenon and you really are</v>

1014
00:42:36.711 --> 00:42:39.770
<v Speaker 3>probably trying to find out whether or</v>
<v Speaker 3>not it's real and maybe you believe a</v>

1015
00:42:39.771 --> 00:42:43.130
<v Speaker 3>little bit too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know enough yet when it came</v>

1016
00:42:43.131 --> 00:42:45.140
<v Speaker 3>to this type of phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1017
00:42:45.141 --> 00:42:48.410
<v Speaker 3>But you gala was already doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other psychics are already doing it in</v>

1018
00:42:48.411 --> 00:42:52.160
<v Speaker 3>other countries and they will be</v>
<v Speaker 3>invalidated as a genuine thing in other</v>

1019
00:42:52.161 --> 00:42:52.994
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1020
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.540
<v Speaker 3>We brought over in France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steven North over in England,</v>

1021
00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:58.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of research going on in</v>

1022
00:42:58.311 --> 00:43:00.560
<v Speaker 3>England at the time on this type of</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomena as well.</v>

1023
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:04.550
<v Speaker 3>It was a really big thing back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just people hosing people.</v>

1024
00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.520
<v Speaker 3>It was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's a weird thing,</v>

1025
00:43:07.521 --> 00:43:09.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So over in England there were,</v>

1026
00:43:09.951 --> 00:43:11.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of what the guy's name is</v>

1027
00:43:11.541 --> 00:43:12.330
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1028
00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:14.170
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a scientist over there,</v>

1029
00:43:14.171 --> 00:43:16.100
<v Speaker 3>a pair of psychologist who was working</v>
<v Speaker 3>with little kids,</v>

1030
00:43:16.101 --> 00:43:19.190
<v Speaker 3>and his thinking is that kids don't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little kids don't lie.</v>

1031
00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.410
<v Speaker 3>That's all they do is lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get to that point where they</v>

1032
00:43:21.411 --> 00:43:23.190
<v Speaker 3>learned how to lie to get anything and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1033
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.340
<v Speaker 3>Kids don't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's someone without kids.</v>

1034
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:28.640
<v Speaker 3>And these kids only got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only reason they got caught,</v>

1035
00:43:28.641 --> 00:43:32.180
<v Speaker 3>which by accident because they were the</v>
<v Speaker 3>video cameras are left on and soon as</v>

1036
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.030
<v Speaker 3>the Paris psychologist left the room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kids were taking forks and spoons</v>

1037
00:43:35.031 --> 00:43:38.690
<v Speaker 3>and actually bending them underneath</v>
<v Speaker 3>their feet and then putting them back up</v>

1038
00:43:38.691 --> 00:43:39.590
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the table.</v>

1039
00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:44.270
<v Speaker 3>So then they would come in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was literally scientists went in with</v>

1040
00:43:44.271 --> 00:43:47.480
<v Speaker 3>the premise that children don't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is one of the dumbest fucking thing</v>

1041
00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:49.670
<v Speaker 3>I've ever heard in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't disagree with you,</v>

1042
00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:52.910
<v Speaker 3>but this is how badly people wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in this phenomenon.</v>

1043
00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.480
<v Speaker 3>Why do people want to believe in hidden</v>
<v Speaker 3>powers?</v>

1044
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:59.210
<v Speaker 3>I think it's white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People want to believe in most things,</v>

1045
00:43:59.211 --> 00:44:00.044
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1046
00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:02.120
<v Speaker 3>we want to find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to believe there's something</v>

1047
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:04.550
<v Speaker 3>more than just us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for most people we're just,</v>

1048
00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:09.380
<v Speaker 3>we're not enough and I don't know if</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because we get so bored with our</v>

1049
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:11.130
<v Speaker 3>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get depressed without lies,</v>

1050
00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:11.800
<v Speaker 3>we get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1051
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.150
<v Speaker 3>we're in this everyday thing of going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

1052
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:16.160
<v Speaker 3>coming home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is this all there is,</v>

1053
00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:16.730
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1054
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:18.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there something else that,</v>

1055
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:21.350
<v Speaker 3>that's a super power that I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could actually have.</v>

1056
00:44:21.351 --> 00:44:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Is there something I can discover that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger than me?</v>

1057
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.700
<v Speaker 3>Better than me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1058
00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.060
<v Speaker 3>does this a units versus much bigger</v>
<v Speaker 3>than just this planet right here.</v>

1059
00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1060
00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that</v>

1061
00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.300
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a Ufo is,</v>

1062
00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:35.070
<v Speaker 2>we'll come in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they were coming here,</v>

1063
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:36.090
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe they were,</v>

1064
00:44:36.091 --> 00:44:38.280
<v Speaker 2>but if they were coming here you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe they were.</v>

1065
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.340
<v Speaker 2>But I think if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't,</v>

1066
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.233
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1067
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I think we would really have real</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>

1068
00:44:45.061 --> 00:44:46.590
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent evidence of it by</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1069
00:44:46.591 --> 00:44:47.760
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1070
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't it make much sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even like for us?</v>

1071
00:44:50.671 --> 00:44:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say we start going looking at</v>

1072
00:44:52.651 --> 00:44:54.720
<v Speaker 2>other planets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we going to send other humans out</v>

1073
00:44:54.721 --> 00:44:59.310
<v Speaker 2>there or are we going to go ahead and</v>
<v Speaker 2>send robots or something like that?</v>

1074
00:44:59.311 --> 00:45:00.830
<v Speaker 2>They can last much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1075
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:03.480
<v Speaker 2>like in the last month and robots are</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting better and better and better.</v>

1076
00:45:03.481 --> 00:45:06.120
<v Speaker 2>So if there's an advanced civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization,</v>

1077
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:10.470
<v Speaker 2>surely they would also have this</v>
<v Speaker 2>advancement where they don't have to</v>

1078
00:45:10.471 --> 00:45:12.870
<v Speaker 2>send themselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can send something to represent</v>

1079
00:45:12.871 --> 00:45:13.020
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1080
00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the real hardcore believers believe</v>

1081
00:45:15.611 --> 00:45:18.810
<v Speaker 2>those grades are gray aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big black eyes.</v>

1082
00:45:18.811 --> 00:45:22.470
<v Speaker 2>They think there's some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>android or something and it could be,</v>

1083
00:45:22.471 --> 00:45:24.630
<v Speaker 2>but I don't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe we had him.</v>

1084
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:29.070
<v Speaker 2>I believed a lot more before I started</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that television show.</v>

1085
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.850
<v Speaker 2>The television show cured me of bigfoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cured me of psychics,</v>

1086
00:45:32.851 --> 00:45:36.210
<v Speaker 2>cured me of aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cured me of almost everything.</v>

1087
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a thing with me,</v>

1088
00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:38.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was a young kid,</v>

1089
00:45:38.251 --> 00:45:39.480
<v Speaker 2>I believe in that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1090
00:45:39.481 --> 00:45:41.430
<v Speaker 2>when I was a young kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spoke in tongues.</v>

1091
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.040
<v Speaker 2>I thought they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1092
00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the whole experience.</v>

1093
00:45:44.461 --> 00:45:45.294
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

1094
00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the chemicals running through my</v>

1095
00:45:46.891 --> 00:45:50.640
<v Speaker 2>body and me just</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the whole damn thing,</v>

1096
00:45:50.641 --> 00:45:51.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go into that.</v>

1097
00:45:51.391 --> 00:45:56.391
<v Speaker 2>And I realized later what was going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time I was looking for answers.</v>

1098
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:59.430
<v Speaker 2>I was looking for answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you mentioned that a very disturbed</v>

1099
00:45:59.431 --> 00:46:02.550
<v Speaker 2>life and you're probably looking for</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of security.</v>

1100
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I got shut down every single time I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would ask the questions.</v>

1101
00:46:04.981 --> 00:46:06.640
<v Speaker 2>I was called a troublemaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1102
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:08.760
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about darkness and evil.</v>

1103
00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how come the Bible's covered in</v>

1104
00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:12.510
<v Speaker 2>black to shut up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't ask questions.</v>

1105
00:46:12.511 --> 00:46:13.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written black.</v>

1106
00:46:13.351 --> 00:46:13.791
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1107
00:46:13.791 --> 00:46:15.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cover of most of the bibles back</v>

1108
00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 2>then we didn't have the white bibles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all had the black bibles and it was</v>

1109
00:46:18.961 --> 00:46:20.790
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just ask innocent questions</v>

1110
00:46:20.791 --> 00:46:21.601
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1111
00:46:21.601 --> 00:46:22.190
<v Speaker 2>well how can I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1112
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:24.600
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking about darkness being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1113
00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:25.690
<v Speaker 2>an evil and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1114
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:28.740
<v Speaker 2>it's all associated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is this Bible covered in black?</v>

1115
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:30.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just wanted answers,</v>

1116
00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.390
<v Speaker 2>was looking for answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would ask these questions and I do</v>

1117
00:46:33.391 --> 00:46:33.570
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1118
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:34.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thirst knowledge,</v>

1119
00:46:34.981 --> 00:46:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I love knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1120
00:46:36.331 --> 00:46:39.390
<v Speaker 2>I read all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just I'm always looking to try to</v>

1121
00:46:39.391 --> 00:46:41.730
<v Speaker 2>understand things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't always retain all that</v>

1122
00:46:41.731 --> 00:46:44.130
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it'll be in the back of my head</v>

1123
00:46:44.131 --> 00:46:47.100
<v Speaker 2>somewhere where it will pop out at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>point when I do need it.</v>

1124
00:46:47.101 --> 00:46:49.110
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is fascinating.</v>

1125
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.320
<v Speaker 2>This desire to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the desire to believe things</v>

1126
00:46:52.321 --> 00:46:56.420
<v Speaker 2>that don't necessarily make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's ghosts or it's Ufos or do</v>

1127
00:46:56.421 --> 00:46:57.960
<v Speaker 2>you ever watch that show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finding bigfoot?</v>

1128
00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.940
<v Speaker 2>I have in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not something I sit down and binge</v>

1129
00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.560
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every episode is like a rock got</v>

1130
00:47:04.561 --> 00:47:09.561
<v Speaker 2>thrown or this same as these gaucher</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that every week nothing happens,</v>

1131
00:47:10.051 --> 00:47:12.510
<v Speaker 2>but somehow they managed to keep you</v>
<v Speaker 2>glued to your seat.</v>

1132
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.760
<v Speaker 2>I think you watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People watch it because they think,</v>

1133
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.960
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be the show.</v>

1134
00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:18.090
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be the one because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>tease it like that.</v>

1135
00:47:18.091 --> 00:47:18.980
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1136
00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:22.590
<v Speaker 2>If it was the one we would have already</v>
<v Speaker 2>heard about it before it got to air.</v>

1137
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:24.870
<v Speaker 2>The key is night vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you have night vision,</v>

1138
00:47:24.871 --> 00:47:28.530
<v Speaker 2>you seem legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looking for things in the basement.</v>

1139
00:47:28.531 --> 00:47:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Are you looking for things in the woods?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have night vision or thermal</v>

1140
00:47:31.691 --> 00:47:32.860
<v Speaker 2>visions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like something.</v>

1141
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

1142
00:47:33.761 --> 00:47:36.280
<v Speaker 2>They'll find it now where it's like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ghost detecting meters,</v>

1143
00:47:36.281 --> 00:47:38.740
<v Speaker 2>so it's a little meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can set them off just by hitting a</v>

1144
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:40.060
<v Speaker 2>walkie talkie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1145
00:47:40.061 --> 00:47:40.781
<v Speaker 2>you can?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1146
00:47:40.781 --> 00:47:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Like way across the room or in another</v>
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

1147
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:45.340
<v Speaker 2>You had a walkie talkie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those things go freaking crazy.</v>

1148
00:47:45.341 --> 00:47:48.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the in paranormal research.</v>

1149
00:47:48.231 --> 00:47:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Is there like a moment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where.</v>

1150
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that in Seti?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Search for extraterrestrial</v>

1151
00:47:55.361 --> 00:47:56.830
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>

1152
00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:59.080
<v Speaker 2>There's this one phenomena that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

1153
00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:01.600
<v Speaker 2>I think they call it the blip or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1154
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the name.</v>

1155
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:06.950
<v Speaker 2>I think it was either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this one</v>

1156
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:11.560
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one loud noise that came from</v>

1157
00:48:11.561 --> 00:48:13.930
<v Speaker 2>space that they think is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what it is.</v>

1158
00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.740
<v Speaker 2>They're not sure what that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know what?</v>

1159
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:19.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm conflating it with something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened under water.</v>

1160
00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.490
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was something.</v>

1161
00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:24.790
<v Speaker 2>There was an organic noise that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>underwater.</v>

1162
00:48:24.791 --> 00:48:27.070
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the signal that's the cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bloop,</v>

1163
00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:28.900
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a steady thing like that.</v>

1164
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:30.820
<v Speaker 2>There is a steady thing like that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm.</v>

1165
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:33.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I confused the two events that there was</v>

1166
00:48:33.521 --> 00:48:37.270
<v Speaker 2>something that happened where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>recorded an organic sound underwater</v>

1167
00:48:37.271 --> 00:48:39.670
<v Speaker 2>from some sort of an animal that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what it was,</v>

1168
00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.980
<v Speaker 2>but they think it could be a whale or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1169
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.560
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just something could be something you</v>

1170
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:46.810
<v Speaker 2>discovered you hadn't seen yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1171
00:48:46.811 --> 00:48:49.120
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of stuff under there we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know about for sure.</v>

1172
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Big Place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1173
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:54.380
<v Speaker 2>When we're talking about the desire for</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1174
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:59.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is what one of the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 2>why being a mentalist works or being one</v>

1175
00:48:59.081 --> 00:49:02.920
<v Speaker 2>of these psychic hoaxers works is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people have this overwhelming</v>

1176
00:49:02.921 --> 00:49:06.700
<v Speaker 2>desire to believe there's something more</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there and not just the powers that</v>

1177
00:49:06.701 --> 00:49:10.750
<v Speaker 2>you and I possess the normal sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing and hearing and touching and</v>

1178
00:49:10.751 --> 00:49:12.700
<v Speaker 2>smelling and d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's more.</v>

1179
00:49:12.701 --> 00:49:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Some people have more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people knowing the phone's going to</v>

1180
00:49:14.861 --> 00:49:16.180
<v Speaker 2>ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people know things.</v>

1181
00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:18.610
<v Speaker 2>They have an intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could sense rs.</v>

1182
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:19.650
<v Speaker 2>Some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1183
00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:20.500
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold my hand.</v>

1184
00:49:20.501 --> 00:49:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Let me look in your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know things.</v>

1185
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.190
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things you don't know.</v>

1186
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like the creepy how you're looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at me right now.</v>

1187
00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing,</v>

1188
00:49:27.611 --> 00:49:30.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what the desire because it</v>

1189
00:49:30.131 --> 00:49:32.350
<v Speaker 2>gives us a white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would somebody be looking at me like</v>

1190
00:49:32.351 --> 00:49:35.380
<v Speaker 2>that if there wasn't a purpose and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe in if there wasn't something</v>

1191
00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:39.670
<v Speaker 2>when I perform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't just read minds.</v>

1192
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.860
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do things like I touch their hand,</v>

1193
00:49:41.861 --> 00:49:43.630
<v Speaker 2>I seen him look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see this right there,</v>

1194
00:49:43.631 --> 00:49:48.250
<v Speaker 2>and I do certain things because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing of like I've got to show a</v>

1195
00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:52.300
<v Speaker 2>process and if I'm showing a process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would I be showing a process if it</v>

1196
00:49:52.301 --> 00:49:54.670
<v Speaker 2>wasn't real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the weird thing was so</v>

1197
00:49:54.671 --> 00:49:56.500
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming them with things to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1198
00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a point.</v>

1199
00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:01.300
<v Speaker 2>I know we you touching them and moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>them or looking at them as all these</v>

1200
00:50:01.301 --> 00:50:05.380
<v Speaker 2>variables they have to take into account</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're on their map of things that</v>

1201
00:50:05.381 --> 00:50:07.960
<v Speaker 2>they're processing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's now some new territory.</v>

1202
00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:09.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1203
00:50:09.301 --> 00:50:10.540
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also.</v>

1204
00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.550
<v Speaker 2>We talked about this earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to come.</v>

1205
00:50:12.551 --> 00:50:13.930
<v Speaker 2>We've got so many stories all over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

1206
00:50:13.931 --> 00:50:15.850
<v Speaker 2>We stopped at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to come back to some of them,</v>

1207
00:50:15.851 --> 00:50:20.851
<v Speaker 2>but it's back in my comedy club days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked the worst and the best clubs.</v>

1208
00:50:21.071 --> 00:50:23.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was at the comedy workshop</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Houston,</v>

1209
00:50:23.411 --> 00:50:24.690
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you remember them on.</v>

1210
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Solos,</v>

1211
00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Sharon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they</v>

1212
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.560
<v Speaker 3>had me come and do a Christmas show</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I wanted a clean show for</v>

1213
00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:32.990
<v Speaker 3>Christmas and I came in and then they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1214
00:50:32.991 --> 00:50:34.220
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go out in the road and</v>

1215
00:50:34.221 --> 00:50:35.810
<v Speaker 3>you're headlining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like straight off headlining.</v>

1216
00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:36.980
<v Speaker 3>No middling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1217
00:50:36.981 --> 00:50:38.240
<v Speaker 3>no opening act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1218
00:50:38.241 --> 00:50:41.180
<v Speaker 3>I went straight into headline in which a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of comedians hated me for that</v>

1219
00:50:41.181 --> 00:50:44.270
<v Speaker 3>because they're working so hard to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like there's no place for magic</v>

1220
00:50:44.271 --> 00:50:45.680
<v Speaker 3>in a comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a comedy club,</v>

1221
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.350
<v Speaker 3>but I was going out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing these comedy clubs,</v>

1222
00:50:48.351 --> 00:50:50.930
<v Speaker 3>but I was doing like the best and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>also doing the worst,</v>

1223
00:50:50.931 --> 00:50:55.470
<v Speaker 3>like I always doing comedy clubs where</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally it's a kick a bar in a,</v>

1224
00:50:55.471 --> 00:50:58.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an oil town and there's Mesh like in</v>

1225
00:50:58.941 --> 00:50:59.721
<v Speaker 3>blue brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1226
00:50:59.721 --> 00:51:02.990
<v Speaker 3>across the front because people throw</v>
<v Speaker 3>beer bottles at the band and everything</v>

1227
00:51:02.991 --> 00:51:06.200
<v Speaker 3>else and I'm performing behind that with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little gate that they have to come in</v>

1228
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:09.950
<v Speaker 3>for me to perform with these people with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big pole in the middle because people</v>

1229
00:51:09.951 --> 00:51:12.710
<v Speaker 3>kick her dance around that and the bar</v>
<v Speaker 3>is actually around the corner and I got</v>

1230
00:51:12.711 --> 00:51:13.630
<v Speaker 3>to try and get people in that.</v>

1231
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:18.350
<v Speaker 3>So I performed at the worst and the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>places I performed in situations where</v>

1232
00:51:18.351 --> 00:51:20.870
<v Speaker 3>people were just not there to see the</v>
<v Speaker 3>performer there.</v>

1233
00:51:20.871 --> 00:51:23.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at colleges where it's a,</v>

1234
00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.330
<v Speaker 3>a day show and day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mandate shows are the worst in</v>

1235
00:51:26.331 --> 00:51:27.920
<v Speaker 3>colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worst if you've done them.</v>

1236
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:29.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you come in,</v>

1237
00:51:29.151 --> 00:51:31.250
<v Speaker 3>it's like they're sitting in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cafeteria.</v>

1238
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:34.460
<v Speaker 3>You are performing the cafeteria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to study for a test.</v>

1239
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.430
<v Speaker 3>They're not there for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got to grab their attention.</v>

1240
00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.650
<v Speaker 3>So my first thing is to come out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1241
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.480
<v Speaker 3>if I was to ask everyone to think of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing card,</v>

1242
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:43.280
<v Speaker 3>you might think ace of spades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>queen of hearts,</v>

1243
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:44.780
<v Speaker 3>I want everyone to think of a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd get one,</v>

1244
00:51:44.781 --> 00:51:45.441
<v Speaker 3>get one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get one,</v>

1245
00:51:45.441 --> 00:51:46.700
<v Speaker 3>get one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up.</v>

1246
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:47.900
<v Speaker 3>And it's like Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam,</v>

1247
00:51:47.901 --> 00:51:48.350
<v Speaker 3>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam,</v>

1248
00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:48.711
<v Speaker 3>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam,</v>

1249
00:51:48.711 --> 00:51:49.041
<v Speaker 3>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam,</v>

1250
00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:49.820
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It where it's like,</v>

1251
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:52.730
<v Speaker 3>holy crap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to pay attention to the sky.</v>

1252
00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:55.850
<v Speaker 3>And so that's where I came in from those</v>
<v Speaker 3>harsh days.</v>

1253
00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:58.490
<v Speaker 3>Really just trying to grab their</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention with comedians.</v>

1254
00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.960
<v Speaker 3>Do Bar gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1255
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:02.420
<v Speaker 3>you just got to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to quiet them down.</v>

1256
00:52:02.421 --> 00:52:05.000
<v Speaker 3>You got to go to grab him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

1257
00:52:05.001 --> 00:52:06.530
<v Speaker 3>so I'm with the scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1258
00:52:06.531 --> 00:52:08.420
<v Speaker 3>we break in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the laboratory at night.</v>

1259
00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have an aquarium,</v>

1260
00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:15.710
<v Speaker 3>there's another psychic there that</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposedly gets ghosts to come in and</v>

1261
00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:18.230
<v Speaker 3>the ghost will write things in these</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee grounds,</v>

1262
00:52:18.231 --> 00:52:21.890
<v Speaker 3>in this inverted aquarium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a with a padlock on it.</v>

1263
00:52:21.891 --> 00:52:24.340
<v Speaker 3>And there's bars that go over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Kid,</v>

1264
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:28.490
<v Speaker 3>the other kid that's with it looks</v>
<v Speaker 3>underneath and realizes that the,</v>

1265
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:32.840
<v Speaker 3>even though it's locked on top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the post that it's locked to those nuts</v>

1266
00:52:32.841 --> 00:52:34.100
<v Speaker 3>underneath it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like bolts,</v>

1267
00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.720
<v Speaker 3>he just unbolted it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifts it up.</v>

1268
00:52:35.721 --> 00:52:39.650
<v Speaker 3>We write stuff in the coffee grounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we bolt it back up and you know,</v>

1269
00:52:39.651 --> 00:52:41.480
<v Speaker 3>so it's like all these things and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>bend everything.</v>

1270
00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.210
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go to bed about five in the morning</v>

1271
00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.390
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter Phillips calls and he calls it</v>

1272
00:52:47.391 --> 00:52:48.830
<v Speaker 3>about seven in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

1273
00:52:48.831 --> 00:52:49.430
<v Speaker 3>how you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1274
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:50.750
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't sleep well last night.</v>

1275
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:52.760
<v Speaker 3>I had a dream that we were in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>laboratory,</v>

1276
00:52:52.761 --> 00:52:54.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to work and everything just bent</v>

1277
00:52:54.831 --> 00:52:56.840
<v Speaker 3>and went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1278
00:52:56.841 --> 00:52:57.630
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back to sleep.</v>

1279
00:52:57.630 --> 00:53:00.040
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk to you in a few hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He calls me back in about another hour.</v>

1280
00:53:00.041 --> 00:53:00.741
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did it,</v>

1281
00:53:00.741 --> 00:53:01.551
<v Speaker 3>you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did it.</v>

1282
00:53:01.551 --> 00:53:02.750
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did we do?</v>

1283
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.280
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1284
00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:05.750
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your psychic powers when you were</v>

1285
00:53:05.751 --> 00:53:08.090
<v Speaker 3>sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bent everything in the laboratory.</v>

1286
00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.950
<v Speaker 3>So it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we play these games.</v>

1287
00:53:09.951 --> 00:53:12.350
<v Speaker 3>We did these live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's still alive.</v>

1288
00:53:12.351 --> 00:53:14.900
<v Speaker 3>I've met him since then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel tricked him.</v>

1289
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.860
<v Speaker 3>He felt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1290
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:20.000
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt bad.</v>

1291
00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:23.020
<v Speaker 3>So we were talking to randy at one point</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

1292
00:53:23.021 --> 00:53:25.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did a conference and there's a kid by</v>

1293
00:53:25.891 --> 00:53:27.540
<v Speaker 3>the name of muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walkie Chiodo.</v>

1294
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:28.510
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1295
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:31.260
<v Speaker 3>from Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Masa walkie could speak English.</v>

1296
00:53:31.261 --> 00:53:34.090
<v Speaker 3>She had a band that he was in as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1297
00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:37.920
<v Speaker 3>so we sang English songs and everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm rooming with him and I say to</v>

1298
00:53:37.921 --> 00:53:39.960
<v Speaker 3>muscle walkie Kyoto because he's playing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it up for real,</v>

1299
00:53:39.961 --> 00:53:40.740
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1300
00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:42.930
<v Speaker 3>and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there anytime when you can't do your</v>

1301
00:53:42.931 --> 00:53:44.310
<v Speaker 3>psychic powers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you use a trick.</v>

1302
00:53:44.311 --> 00:53:44.940
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1303
00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:46.860
<v Speaker 3>can't speak English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cannot speak English.</v>

1304
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:48.390
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden he couldn't speak</v>
<v Speaker 3>English.</v>

1305
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:51.120
<v Speaker 3>So with this gallows at the thing as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1306
00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason I mentioned muscle walk</v>

1307
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.870
<v Speaker 3>is because there was a TV producer from</v>
<v Speaker 3>England that came over and he said to</v>

1308
00:53:57.871 --> 00:53:58.351
<v Speaker 3>randy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1309
00:53:58.351 --> 00:54:00.690
<v Speaker 3>randy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would convince you that this stuff</v>

1310
00:54:00.691 --> 00:54:01.910
<v Speaker 3>is genuine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rainy,</v>

1311
00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.830
<v Speaker 3>gave him the same 11 caveats that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave to the scientist,</v>

1312
00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:07.380
<v Speaker 3>the same 11 carrots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1313
00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:08.490
<v Speaker 3>the guy followed them.</v>

1314
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:10.620
<v Speaker 3>He sat with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sat with Mike,</v>

1315
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.290
<v Speaker 3>he sat with muscle walkie up the muscle</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk.</v>

1316
00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:17.070
<v Speaker 3>He had a way for twisting a spoon and</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically had a thing in his shoe.</v>

1317
00:54:17.071 --> 00:54:18.660
<v Speaker 3>He would go down and when nobody was</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking,</v>

1318
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:21.990
<v Speaker 3>put it in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because this guy followed the 11</v>

1319
00:54:21.991 --> 00:54:24.390
<v Speaker 3>caveats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing happened that day.</v>

1320
00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:28.860
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely nothing happened until the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cameras went off.</v>

1321
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:33.000
<v Speaker 3>The moment the cameras went off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle walkie twist that a spoon and</v>

1322
00:54:33.001 --> 00:54:37.470
<v Speaker 3>started getting it to twist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The producer had a complete mental</v>

1323
00:54:37.471 --> 00:54:38.160
<v Speaker 3>breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1324
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.150
<v Speaker 3>to this point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just thinking,</v>

1325
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:40.050
<v Speaker 3>this is tricks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1326
00:54:40.051 --> 00:54:42.060
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that big of a deal.</v>

1327
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:46.860
<v Speaker 3>He starts screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yelling that randy's evil should never</v>

1328
00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:48.930
<v Speaker 3>have listened to randy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would've got this on tape if it</v>

1329
00:54:48.931 --> 00:54:53.280
<v Speaker 3>wasn't for Randy and he looks down and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a wet spot on the front of his</v>

1330
00:54:53.281 --> 00:54:57.300
<v Speaker 3>pants and he looks down and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just had a demonic ejaculation,</v>

1331
00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.060
<v Speaker 3>like literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's having his mental breakdown.</v>

1332
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:04.470
<v Speaker 3>I go and I have to spend the night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was not a bad thing.</v>

1333
00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:08.670
<v Speaker 3>She was quite pleasant to look at his</v>
<v Speaker 3>his assistant.</v>

1334
00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:12.300
<v Speaker 3>I had to spend the night with her in her</v>
<v Speaker 3>room because randy was calling her.</v>

1335
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:13.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm not randy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1336
00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:14.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1337
00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:18.360
<v Speaker 3>Tony editable calling of the producer</v>
<v Speaker 3>was calling her consistently screaming</v>

1338
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:20.220
<v Speaker 3>and yelling about randy and this scared</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1339
00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Hold the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just gloss over the fact that</v>

1340
00:55:23.431 --> 00:55:25.590
<v Speaker 2>guy just noted in his pants and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling,</v>

1341
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:28.050
<v Speaker 2>you just had a mental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a mental breakdown,</v>

1342
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.440
<v Speaker 2>orgasm and your pants during a mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>breakdown.</v>

1343
00:55:31.441 --> 00:55:33.780
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did it that you should document that.</v>

1344
00:55:33.781 --> 00:55:35.430
<v Speaker 2>That's more present than bending a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spoon.</v>

1345
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:36.420
<v Speaker 2>I should've said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1346
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.400
<v Speaker 2>that's my psychic ability working right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1347
00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:40.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

1348
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:44.020
<v Speaker 2>So he tells you this as an ejaculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His pants.</v>

1349
00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:47.000
<v Speaker 2>He in front of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says it's a demonic ejaculation.</v>

1350
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:49.230
<v Speaker 2>East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Straight up says I added the Arctic</v>

1351
00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.800
<v Speaker 2>ejaculations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems like a together guy with</v>

1352
00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.600
<v Speaker 2>definitely got a head on his shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was a producer for us.</v>

1353
00:55:54.601 --> 00:55:56.610
<v Speaker 2>I think it was BBC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not mistaken.</v>

1354
00:55:56.611 --> 00:55:58.370
<v Speaker 2>He was doing a documentary for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah.</v>

1355
00:55:58.410 --> 00:55:59.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking crazy.</v>

1356
00:55:59.611 --> 00:56:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He finished.</v>

1357
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:02.760
<v Speaker 2>He finished a documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1358
00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

1359
00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:05.010
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't crazy then.</v>

1360
00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:07.610
<v Speaker 2>As long as you finish this documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1361
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:11.160
<v Speaker 2>he believed in psychic phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believed that the demon made them</v>

1362
00:56:11.161 --> 00:56:12.450
<v Speaker 2>come in his pants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is true,</v>

1363
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:15.000
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As show it to you as to whether he</v>

1364
00:56:15.001 --> 00:56:16.980
<v Speaker 2>believed it was a demon or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1365
00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Demons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Demonic.</v>

1366
00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Ejaculate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When your parents,</v>

1367
00:56:19.771 --> 00:56:20.990
<v Speaker 2>what do you like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull your shirt down.</v>

1368
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Like get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I wouldn't dating that demon.</v>

1369
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean probably the price to pay that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't want that.</v>

1370
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Don't need a girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donate a woman at that point.</v>

1371
00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Grants when disagreement and yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good looking demon.</v>

1372
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:39.990
<v Speaker 2>So he was saying that randy was evil</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if it wasn't for Randy's rules</v>

1373
00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:42.760
<v Speaker 2>that he would not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have got this on tape.</v>

1374
00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.820
<v Speaker 2>But how dumb does that guy have to be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is so silly.</v>

1375
00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a person that's supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be discovering or at least investigating</v>

1376
00:56:49.901 --> 00:56:53.860
<v Speaker 2>psychic phenomena and he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that investigator,</v>

1377
00:56:53.861 --> 00:56:54.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a producer.</v>

1378
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.950
<v Speaker 2>He's a producer who believes in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena.</v>

1379
00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Hence he wants to do a documentary on</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychic phenomena.</v>

1380
00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:01.300
<v Speaker 2>Has an interest in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He already believes in it,</v>

1381
00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.370
<v Speaker 2>so he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not as bad as the,</v>

1382
00:57:04.410 --> 00:57:08.020
<v Speaker 2>the Paris psychologists who are supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be using proper science because I'm</v>

1383
00:57:08.021 --> 00:57:10.600
<v Speaker 2>often asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it right?</v>

1384
00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Is it ethical that you full scientists</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the name of science?</v>

1385
00:57:13.751 --> 00:57:15.880
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this becomes this whole big question</v>

1386
00:57:15.881 --> 00:57:16.220
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1387
00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:19.120
<v Speaker 2>we will be unethical to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1388
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.450
<v Speaker 2>and my aunts that did that in a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck asked you that question?</v>

1389
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.260
<v Speaker 2>A lot of scientists say that fools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1390
00:57:25.261 --> 00:57:26.030
<v Speaker 2>and it's a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1391
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Because if you think that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1392
00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:32.170
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ask a guy who's a thief to break</v>

1393
00:57:32.171 --> 00:57:35.680
<v Speaker 2>into your house and then he breaks into</v>
<v Speaker 2>your house in a method that with a</v>

1394
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.830
<v Speaker 2>method that you didn't anticipate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that unethical?</v>

1395
00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.840
<v Speaker 2>It's no different than what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1396
00:57:40.841 --> 00:57:42.100
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a mentalist.</v>

1397
00:57:42.101 --> 00:57:44.230
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a person who is trying to trick</v>

1398
00:57:44.231 --> 00:57:46.330
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have all these rules setup to make</v>

1399
00:57:46.331 --> 00:57:49.180
<v Speaker 2>sure that you don't trick them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they know for a fact that what you're</v>

1400
00:57:49.181 --> 00:57:52.000
<v Speaker 2>doing is psychic energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't really have psychic</v>

1401
00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:55.270
<v Speaker 2>powers and you absolutely don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course you're going to fucking trick</v>

1402
00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.520
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that you would trick them and</v>

1403
00:57:57.521 --> 00:57:59.380
<v Speaker 2>that would somehow or another be</v>
<v Speaker 2>unethical.</v>

1404
00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:01.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just played the game better than</v>

1405
00:58:01.001 --> 00:58:01.451
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1406
00:58:01.451 --> 00:58:02.500
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was the point,</v>

1407
00:58:02.501 --> 00:58:03.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was this thing of like,</v>

1408
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:04.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my thing was,</v>

1409
00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:08.830
<v Speaker 2>should you be taking money to</v>
<v Speaker 2>investigate this phenomena under false</v>

1410
00:58:08.831 --> 00:58:12.460
<v Speaker 2>pretenses because you're not using</v>
<v Speaker 2>proper science if you're using proper</v>

1411
00:58:12.461 --> 00:58:14.500
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't get away with any of this.</v>

1412
00:58:14.501 --> 00:58:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Had you have followed brandy's rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would not have got away with any of</v>

1413
00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:18.040
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1414
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:20.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had very strict ethical rules.</v>

1415
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:21.880
<v Speaker 2>If you ask us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we magicians,</v>

1416
00:58:21.881 --> 00:58:24.430
<v Speaker 2>we have to say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you ask us if we're working for the</v>

1417
00:58:24.431 --> 00:58:27.430
<v Speaker 2>amazing randy with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to say yes.</v>

1418
00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have all these rules.</v>

1419
00:58:29.351 --> 00:58:32.920
<v Speaker 2>Those old TV shows where like if someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>was an undercover cop and say,</v>

1420
00:58:32.921 --> 00:58:35.110
<v Speaker 2>are you a cop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to tell you that they don't</v>

1421
00:58:35.111 --> 00:58:37.300
<v Speaker 2>really have to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's they don't know.</v>

1422
00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:40.500
<v Speaker 2>That's the only premise they use really</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows a damn it.</v>

1423
00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Have you asked a cop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you a cop?</v>

1424
00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.270
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1425
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:46.060
<v Speaker 2>and then you buy the heroin off him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Them still go to jail.</v>

1426
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1427
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:50.710
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go buy heroin or anything,</v>

1428
00:58:50.711 --> 00:58:52.060
<v Speaker 2>but you know there may be something</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1429
00:58:52.061 --> 00:58:54.290
<v Speaker 2>I'll say something about a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1430
00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:57.130
<v Speaker 2>There's very few people that have told</v>
<v Speaker 2>me a story where I go,</v>

1431
00:58:57.131 --> 00:58:58.750
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I was there for that story,</v>

1432
00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:01.960
<v Speaker 2>but the nuts and the pants and blaming a</v>
<v Speaker 2>demon,</v>

1433
00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I really do wish I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really wish I was there for that guy.</v>

1434
00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:07.660
<v Speaker 2>I like to be in the room and I'd be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1435
00:59:07.661 --> 00:59:09.610
<v Speaker 2>hold up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything else.</v>

1436
00:59:09.611 --> 00:59:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Just going to get put on the back burner</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1437
00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Nowadays it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

1438
00:59:12.821 --> 00:59:16.030
<v Speaker 2>let me get my smartphone out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to take a picture on instagram.</v>

1439
00:59:16.031 --> 00:59:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Demon and why are you showing me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just so parents.</v>

1440
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:21.890
<v Speaker 2>How much do you have to come?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your pants were chosen.</v>

1441
00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

1442
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.260
<v Speaker 3>outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1443
00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:29.770
<v Speaker 3>We was scared though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like kids like we will,</v>

1444
00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:33.810
<v Speaker 3>we will kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So probably towards the end 19 would've</v>

1445
00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:35.360
<v Speaker 3>been about 1981.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 82.</v>

1446
00:59:35.361 --> 00:59:36.710
<v Speaker 3>That means I'm 21,</v>
<v Speaker 3>22,</v>

1447
00:59:36.711 --> 00:59:38.480
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could probably still kick</v>

1448
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:39.470
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1449
00:59:39.471 --> 00:59:44.471
<v Speaker 3>But keep in mind I was also a kid who</v>
<v Speaker 3>was very like socially and like not.</v>

1450
00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:47.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm the kid in the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>class when the heavy coat on in the</v>

1451
00:59:47.651 --> 00:59:49.790
<v Speaker 3>middle of winter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that the first time a guy that ever</v>

1452
00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:53.900
<v Speaker 3>came in his pants and then pointed to it</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of me as well?</v>

1453
00:59:53.901 --> 00:59:54.550
<v Speaker 3>For me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1454
00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:58.340
<v Speaker 3>That's never happened my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can never say I've ever had that</v>

1455
00:59:58.341 --> 00:59:59.770
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know ever.</v>

1456
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:02.870
<v Speaker 3>I like to go to my grave without anybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever nothing in their parents.</v>

1457
01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:05.660
<v Speaker 3>And then pointing down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go look at Damon made me do this.</v>

1458
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Or you have an excuse now if it ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens to you.</v>

1459
01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Well now the problem is millions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have heard this and so they'll</v>

1460
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:17.030
<v Speaker 3>just scan me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to run into people.</v>

1461
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys are going to pull their shirt.</v>

1462
01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:22.620
<v Speaker 3>He goes to work at a comedy comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be 10 guys,</v>

1463
01:00:22.621 --> 01:00:24.890
<v Speaker 3>stand up with a puddle pointing down</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a little bit.</v>

1464
01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.210
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be great day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not in my pants.</v>

1465
01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:29.210
<v Speaker 3>Did you bring nails?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man?</v>

1466
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.350
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I brought Nelson.</v>

1467
01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:31.880
<v Speaker 3>I got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got some stuff.</v>

1468
01:00:31.881 --> 01:00:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we might get to some of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1469
01:00:33.261 --> 01:00:35.030
<v Speaker 3>I have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have stuff here in case.</v>

1470
01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:39.950
<v Speaker 3>So you felt bad that you trick this</v>
<v Speaker 3>dummy with Mike and I really like.</v>

1471
01:00:39.951 --> 01:00:42.380
<v Speaker 3>We were scared because we realized the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>

1472
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.160
<v Speaker 3>He was unhinged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that we realized the kind of power</v>

1473
01:00:46.161 --> 01:00:49.500
<v Speaker 3>we had over these people at that point</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just them,</v>

1474
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:51.850
<v Speaker 3>but it's like there's another whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing going.</v>

1475
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:55.350
<v Speaker 3>This whole psychological thing going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>here because they want to believe so</v>

1476
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:57.560
<v Speaker 3>badly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really messing with people's heads,</v>

1477
01:00:57.561 --> 01:00:59.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're really.</v>

1478
01:00:59.211 --> 01:01:02.090
<v Speaker 3>And what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We come out and say this is all a fraud</v>

1479
01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:03.110
<v Speaker 3>and fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we sat down random.</v>

1480
01:01:03.111 --> 01:01:03.944
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1481
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:06.680
<v Speaker 3>we want to come out and we want to end</v>
<v Speaker 3>it now.</v>

1482
01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:07.700
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1483
01:01:07.701 --> 01:01:09.620
<v Speaker 3>We got a TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to be coming up in a couple</v>

1484
01:01:09.621 --> 01:01:11.660
<v Speaker 3>of months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just wait and expose it then.</v>

1485
01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:13.450
<v Speaker 3>It's not gonna make any difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>

1486
01:01:13.451 --> 01:01:15.110
<v Speaker 3>we hung out until that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1487
01:01:15.111 --> 01:01:16.620
<v Speaker 3>there was a peripheral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1488
01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.760
<v Speaker 3>scientists and there was one guy with</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of that birth or swartz.</v>

1489
01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.300
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to do anything with him</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he kind of came into the scene</v>

1490
01:01:23.301 --> 01:01:26.720
<v Speaker 3>at the end of working with the Mac lab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he kept pushing and pushing and</v>

1491
01:01:26.721 --> 01:01:28.670
<v Speaker 3>pushing and he lived in New Jersey.</v>

1492
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:34.010
<v Speaker 3>So finally I went out there and this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of believed in everything it was.</v>

1493
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.110
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wrote a whole book called the,</v>

1494
01:01:36.111 --> 01:01:37.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tanning,</v>

1495
01:01:37.011 --> 01:01:40.590
<v Speaker 3>the poltergeists of the poultry taming</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tammy.</v>

1496
01:01:40.591 --> 01:01:42.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys you can find it online as well.</v>

1497
01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:47.060
<v Speaker 3>And it was a booklet and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was for the psychosis psychosis</v>

1498
01:01:47.061 --> 01:01:47.980
<v Speaker 3>dynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1499
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.500
<v Speaker 3>something like as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something of dentistry and medicine,</v>

1500
01:01:51.501 --> 01:01:55.610
<v Speaker 3>but it was an actual medical journal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was all about his stuff that he had</v>

1501
01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:57.320
<v Speaker 3>done with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1502
01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.760
<v Speaker 3>but this guy believed in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1503
01:01:58.761 --> 01:02:00.970
<v Speaker 3>he handed me a camera one time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1504
01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a video camera and he said,</v>

1505
01:02:03.321 --> 01:02:03.840
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1506
01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:04.441
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1507
01:02:04.441 --> 01:02:09.441
<v Speaker 3>I knew a lady that could take pictures</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the sky and when I get the film and</v>

1508
01:02:10.131 --> 01:02:12.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it developed and I look at it and</v>

1509
01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:15.350
<v Speaker 3>I play it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see Ufo is in the sky that you</v>

1510
01:02:15.351 --> 01:02:16.730
<v Speaker 3>couldn't see with the naked eye.</v>

1511
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:18.080
<v Speaker 3>Can you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now?</v>

1512
01:02:18.081 --> 01:02:19.590
<v Speaker 3>I was one of these kids that I was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1513
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I would say I could do anything and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1514
01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Even in the laboratory I would say I</v>
<v Speaker 3>could do anything.</v>

1515
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:25.830
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he hands me the camera.</v>

1516
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:30.390
<v Speaker 3>I start taking pictures of the parking</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot in the sky and everything and I hand</v>

1517
01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:32.640
<v Speaker 3>it back to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he gets it developed when he gets</v>

1518
01:02:32.641 --> 01:02:34.830
<v Speaker 3>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is vacation footage and then</v>

1519
01:02:34.831 --> 01:02:39.831
<v Speaker 3>there's him handing me the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see all of a sudden this weird kind</v>

1520
01:02:40.081 --> 01:02:43.770
<v Speaker 3>of blog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the blob you see a woman's torso</v>

1521
01:02:43.771 --> 01:02:46.140
<v Speaker 3>and thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see a woman giving birth to a baby.</v>

1522
01:02:46.141 --> 01:02:51.141
<v Speaker 3>You see Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see all these images and he,</v>

1523
01:02:51.441 --> 01:02:51.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1524
01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.640
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1525
01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.990
<v Speaker 3>he pointed them out to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see them as well when you</v>

1526
01:02:54.991 --> 01:02:57.790
<v Speaker 3>actually pointed Aurora Shark test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>

1527
01:02:57.790 --> 01:02:58.680
<v Speaker 3>Sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1528
01:02:58.681 --> 01:03:00.590
<v Speaker 3>because this guy's affording</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologists.</v>

1529
01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.490
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'll,</v>

1530
01:03:02.491 --> 01:03:05.340
<v Speaker 3>all I had simply done was I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what to do.</v>

1531
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.170
<v Speaker 3>I was just making stuff up as I went</v>
<v Speaker 3>along.</v>

1532
01:03:07.171 --> 01:03:12.000
<v Speaker 3>So I spat on the front of the camera and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Blob as it changes and as it dried,</v>

1533
01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:14.730
<v Speaker 3>almost like looking at clouds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could see all these different</v>

1534
01:03:14.731 --> 01:03:18.540
<v Speaker 3>shapes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he believed that this was psychic</v>

1535
01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:20.340
<v Speaker 3>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was something that was happening.</v>

1536
01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.460
<v Speaker 3>Now I got to give the Mac lab credit</v>
<v Speaker 3>because when Peter Phillips said,</v>

1537
01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.330
<v Speaker 3>saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1538
01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.340
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a blob of water and,</v>

1539
01:03:27.350 --> 01:03:28.040
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1540
01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.670
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but birth always said to him,</v>

1541
01:03:29.671 --> 01:03:30.660
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1542
01:03:30.661 --> 01:03:32.910
<v Speaker 3>but it's what's in the blog that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

1543
01:03:32.911 --> 01:03:35.010
<v Speaker 3>It's what you see inside that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

1544
01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:37.290
<v Speaker 3>He called me up one day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived in Pennsylvania.</v>

1545
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:38.970
<v Speaker 3>Then he called me up one day and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did it.</v>

1546
01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:39.960
<v Speaker 3>You did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1547
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:42.210
<v Speaker 3>what did I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1548
01:03:42.211 --> 01:03:43.140
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this jar,</v>

1549
01:03:43.141 --> 01:03:46.080
<v Speaker 3>and there was this one jar that he would</v>
<v Speaker 3>have silverware and things inside,</v>

1550
01:03:46.081 --> 01:03:50.310
<v Speaker 3>and they were all sealed and he would</v>
<v Speaker 3>have sitting up on a shelf and it's 7:00</v>

1551
01:03:50.311 --> 01:03:52.560
<v Speaker 3>every night I was supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrate and never did,</v>

1552
01:03:52.561 --> 01:03:55.960
<v Speaker 3>but I was supposed to concentrate from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania and get the try to get the</v>

1553
01:03:55.961 --> 01:03:59.400
<v Speaker 3>stuff to ben long distance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he calls me up.</v>

1554
01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:00.280
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that Joe,</v>

1555
01:04:00.281 --> 01:04:01.530
<v Speaker 3>you concentrate every night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

1556
01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:03.210
<v Speaker 3>I know that you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1557
01:04:03.211 --> 01:04:04.170
<v Speaker 3>you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm thinking,</v>

1558
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.880
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>

1559
01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell happened here?</v>

1560
01:04:05.971 --> 01:04:06.481
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1561
01:04:06.481 --> 01:04:08.730
<v Speaker 3>you actually missed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you hit the radiator and it's</v>

1562
01:04:08.731 --> 01:04:13.620
<v Speaker 3>leaking all over the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he believed that's how much this guy</v>

1563
01:04:13.621 --> 01:04:15.450
<v Speaker 3>believed in all this stuff and gave me</v>
<v Speaker 3>credit.</v>

1564
01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:17.760
<v Speaker 3>But when you read it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the interesting thing,</v>

1565
01:04:17.761 --> 01:04:18.421
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1566
01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:22.020
<v Speaker 3>He stuck electrodes on my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did all kinds of psychological tests</v>

1567
01:04:22.021 --> 01:04:25.470
<v Speaker 3>and the psychological tests turned out</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if I wasn't psychic,</v>

1568
01:04:25.471 --> 01:04:28.590
<v Speaker 3>I would be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those tests,</v>

1569
01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:30.540
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his psychological tests for me show that</v>

1570
01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:32.970
<v Speaker 3>if I wasn't like psychic I would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>

1571
01:04:32.971 --> 01:04:35.130
<v Speaker 3>but I was asking and answering the</v>
<v Speaker 3>questions like a psychic,</v>

1572
01:04:35.131 --> 01:04:38.270
<v Speaker 3>like a psychic wooden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Berthold Schwartz was a,</v>

1573
01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:41.910
<v Speaker 3>another character and at the very end</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we came out and said this was all a</v>

1574
01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:43.110
<v Speaker 3>fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was all a fake.</v>

1575
01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:47.040
<v Speaker 3>Berthold was the one that said amongst a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of other people,</v>

1576
01:04:47.041 --> 01:04:48.510
<v Speaker 3>but he was the primary one that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1577
01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:51.840
<v Speaker 3>they say they were lying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then how do we know they're not lying</v>

1578
01:04:51.841 --> 01:04:53.470
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh good.</v>

1579
01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:55.320
<v Speaker 3>Which is an interesting question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1580
01:04:55.321 --> 01:04:58.080
<v Speaker 3>But my answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I can show you how I did those</v>

1581
01:04:58.081 --> 01:04:58.914
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1582
01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:01.260
<v Speaker 3>Even the Mac lab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1583
01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:04.530
<v Speaker 3>we had a conference in the time life</v>
<v Speaker 3>building in New York where we came</v>

1584
01:05:04.531 --> 01:05:06.180
<v Speaker 3>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said it was all a hoax we got up</v>

1585
01:05:06.181 --> 01:05:08.460
<v Speaker 3>there and if you can ever find footage</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this online,</v>

1586
01:05:08.461 --> 01:05:12.540
<v Speaker 3>it's great because randy introduces us</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's time life building.</v>

1587
01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1588
01:05:13.831 --> 01:05:15.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discover magazine,</v>

1589
01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:17.440
<v Speaker 3>psychology today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1590
01:05:17.441 --> 01:05:18.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the New York Times,</v>

1591
01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.380
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody from all over the world there.</v>

1592
01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.340
<v Speaker 3>And they think Randy's found two</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychics that are genuine and we get up</v>

1593
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:26.620
<v Speaker 3>there and we demonstrate stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Randy's,</v>

1594
01:05:26.621 --> 01:05:28.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody asks the question,</v>

1595
01:05:28.151 --> 01:05:29.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you do it?</v>

1596
01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:30.820
<v Speaker 3>And Randy looks at us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>

1597
01:05:30.821 --> 01:05:33.160
<v Speaker 3>you want to answer Mike?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Mike Edwards walks over,</v>

1598
01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:34.003
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1599
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:37.300
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a hoax,</v>

1600
01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:38.560
<v Speaker 3>it's a trick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I say,</v>

1601
01:05:38.561 --> 01:05:39.970
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the last four years we've been</v>

1602
01:05:39.971 --> 01:05:42.710
<v Speaker 3>fooling the scientists and that's when</v>
<v Speaker 3>we came out and you see that mouse open.</v>

1603
01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:43.960
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1604
01:05:43.961 --> 01:05:44.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1605
01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.610
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great.</v>

1606
01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:47.770
<v Speaker 3>Great footage when you could see it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's that moment,</v>

1607
01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:52.720
<v Speaker 3>the scientists would not answer that</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone until we spoke to them.</v>

1608
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:56.980
<v Speaker 3>And I have the recording,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have jay had the recording of where I</v>

1609
01:05:56.981 --> 01:06:01.981
<v Speaker 3>ended up calling them back and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>recording the conversation and I,</v>

1610
01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.810
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've heard this rumor that you guys are</v>

1611
01:06:04.811 --> 01:06:07.240
<v Speaker 3>working with Randy and that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

1612
01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.740
<v Speaker 3>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think?</v>

1613
01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:12.310
<v Speaker 3>And he says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can't be true.</v>

1614
01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.320
<v Speaker 3>It has to be real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

1615
01:06:14.321 --> 01:06:16.030
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately it is true.</v>

1616
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:18.520
<v Speaker 3>And he starts asking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1617
01:06:18.521 --> 01:06:21.190
<v Speaker 3>how did you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I tell him how did you do that?</v>

1618
01:06:21.191 --> 01:06:24.880
<v Speaker 3>And I tell him and he's constantly</v>
<v Speaker 3>asking about this and that,</v>

1619
01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:28.660
<v Speaker 3>trying to find one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing that he could hold onto.</v>

1620
01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.290
<v Speaker 3>And there was some little things because</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times when you have real</v>

1621
01:06:32.291 --> 01:06:34.900
<v Speaker 3>information and you know you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be to do something,</v>

1622
01:06:34.901 --> 01:06:37.480
<v Speaker 3>you take chances and sometimes those</v>
<v Speaker 3>chances hit as well.</v>

1623
01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:40.510
<v Speaker 3>So you can't explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just the odds,</v>

1624
01:06:40.511 --> 01:06:42.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:48.300
<v Speaker 3>So he wanted desperately to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thought was that maybe you had</v>

1626
01:06:48.791 --> 01:06:52.300
<v Speaker 3>psychic powers but you didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to know you at psyche power so</v>

1627
01:06:52.301 --> 01:06:55.180
<v Speaker 3>that you trick them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you were lying afterwards to</v>

1628
01:06:55.181 --> 01:06:57.170
<v Speaker 3>conceal your power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1629
01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:02.060
<v Speaker 3>He also mentioned that Randy May have</v>
<v Speaker 3>paid us off to life for him too.</v>

1630
01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:04.570
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he was probably devastated,</v>

1631
01:07:04.571 --> 01:07:05.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because as a scientist,</v>

1632
01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:06.701
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1633
01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:09.400
<v Speaker 3>he caught a guy that I knew in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington,</v>

1634
01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:11.830
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania where I lived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think the guys still lives there</v>

1635
01:07:11.831 --> 01:07:13.440
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it had been the name of Joe newsome</v>

1636
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:17.410
<v Speaker 3>and Joe was an escape artist and I knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe now,</v>

1637
01:07:17.411 --> 01:07:20.350
<v Speaker 3>keep in mind when I was doing all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really didn't know any magicians.</v>

1638
01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:21.880
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when I started out,</v>

1639
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:24.820
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know there was an area of magic</v>
<v Speaker 3>call mentalism,</v>

1640
01:07:24.821 --> 01:07:25.760
<v Speaker 3>which is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1641
01:07:25.761 --> 01:07:28.260
<v Speaker 3>taking your five senses to create the</v>
<v Speaker 3>illusion of a sixth sense.</v>

1642
01:07:28.290 --> 01:07:31.090
<v Speaker 3>You not a psychic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're using tricks using psychology,</v>

1643
01:07:31.091 --> 01:07:32.380
<v Speaker 3>verbal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonverbal communication,</v>

1644
01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:34.560
<v Speaker 3>but mostly magic to create these tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1645
01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:35.950
<v Speaker 3>I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>

1646
01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:39.760
<v Speaker 3>I just knew there were people that con</v>
<v Speaker 3>people with tricks to make them think</v>

1647
01:07:39.761 --> 01:07:41.980
<v Speaker 3>they were psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all that I knew at that time.</v>

1648
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:45.580
<v Speaker 3>But I met a few magicians and one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them was Joe newsome.</v>

1649
01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:47.650
<v Speaker 3>So birth Schwartz caught up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

1650
01:07:47.651 --> 01:07:48.580
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would,</v>

1651
01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:50.800
<v Speaker 3>why would steve do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would I do this?</v>

1652
01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:52.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Joe says,</v>

1653
01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:54.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I could open the locks with my mind.</v>

1654
01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.890
<v Speaker 3>Joe Proceeded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I thought was a really asshole</v>

1655
01:07:59.891 --> 01:08:02.530
<v Speaker 3>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Proceeded to work with him for years</v>

1656
01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:05.560
<v Speaker 3>until birth old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>died and birth will believe that Joe has</v>

1657
01:08:05.561 --> 01:08:07.240
<v Speaker 3>psychic powers and I called Joe up one</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1658
01:08:07.241 --> 01:08:08.170
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why you doing this?</v>

1659
01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:09.400
<v Speaker 3>This guy has been through enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1660
01:08:09.401 --> 01:08:11.620
<v Speaker 3>we've already expose it as a fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a fake,</v>

1661
01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:13.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you doing this to that guy?</v>

1662
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 3>And rather than answer the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he pretended</v>

1663
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.710
<v Speaker 2>that he was his brother that had</v>
<v Speaker 2>answered the phone,</v>

1664
01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:22.700
<v Speaker 2>but I know Joe and I knew Joe and I knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was his brother doesn't sound</v>

1665
01:08:22.701 --> 01:08:25.790
<v Speaker 2>anything like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So isn't it possible that some people</v>

1666
01:08:25.791 --> 01:08:26.390
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1667
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:29.810
<v Speaker 2>some people like playing tennis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people like fucking with people,</v>

1668
01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:32.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He likes fucking with people that sport</v>

1669
01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:33.610
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1670
01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:37.550
<v Speaker 2>He probably gets a hold of a mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't kill it,</v>

1671
01:08:37.770 --> 01:08:41.990
<v Speaker 2>so let's it crawl away a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then swats it and brings it back and</v>

1672
01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.160
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Survive.</v>

1673
01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:45.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's probably what he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1674
01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Well sometimes a mouse likes that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1675
01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:50.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the mouse over like I was</v>

1676
01:08:50.151 --> 01:08:51.070
<v Speaker 2>talking to my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1677
01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.370
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to my friend tires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1678
01:08:52.371 --> 01:08:55.940
<v Speaker 2>So there's this thing of this enzyme</v>
<v Speaker 2>that cats have.</v>

1679
01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of what it talks to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>plasma enzyme.</v>

1680
01:08:59.061 --> 01:08:59.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a parasite.</v>

1681
01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that goes into some nice where they</v>

1682
01:09:03.021 --> 01:09:06.130
<v Speaker 2>think it's okay to have fun to play with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cat or a more complicated than that,</v>

1683
01:09:06.131 --> 01:09:11.131
<v Speaker 2>but it actually turns their sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>reward system sideways where the cat is</v>

1684
01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:14.360
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the cat urinates the smell of cat</v>

1685
01:09:14.361 --> 01:09:17.120
<v Speaker 2>urine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets them excited and actually makes the</v>

1686
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:21.750
<v Speaker 2>mouse aroused and it removes all fear</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1687
01:09:21.751 --> 01:09:23.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the cat cat.</v>

1688
01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the only way that toxoplasmosis</v>

1689
01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:29.650
<v Speaker 2>gone d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the parasite can reproduce,</v>

1690
01:09:29.651 --> 01:09:34.651
<v Speaker 2>is inside the cat's gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the cat has to eat the mouse or the</v>

1691
01:09:34.911 --> 01:09:38.360
<v Speaker 2>rat in order for this parasite to</v>
<v Speaker 2>reproduce.</v>

1692
01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:42.530
<v Speaker 2>And then the reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is it doesn't affect the cat's</v>

1693
01:09:42.531 --> 01:09:43.940
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very strange,</v>

1694
01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:46.400
<v Speaker 2>but it does affect people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does affect people.</v>

1695
01:09:46.401 --> 01:09:48.340
<v Speaker 2>And it does affect rats and mice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1696
01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's why we have cat</v>
<v Speaker 2>ladies?</v>

1697
01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think it affects those crazy</v>

1698
01:09:53.001 --> 01:09:53.880
<v Speaker 2>bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think?</v>

1699
01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:56.090
<v Speaker 2>You said it doesn't affect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't affect people,</v>

1700
01:09:56.091 --> 01:09:58.760
<v Speaker 2>but do you think it does affect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't affect.</v>

1701
01:09:58.761 --> 01:09:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Cat's got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

1702
01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.750
<v Speaker 2>The cat's behavior seems to be the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same,</v>

1703
01:10:02.751 --> 01:10:06.350
<v Speaker 2>but it definitely affects people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes people more impulsive.</v>

1704
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:11.630
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of weird correlations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a recent study that showed that</v>

1705
01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:15.350
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior is often connected with</v>

1706
01:10:15.351 --> 01:10:17.460
<v Speaker 2>toxoplasmosis infection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1707
01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:21.800
<v Speaker 2>People are more risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more inclined to take risks and</v>

1708
01:10:21.801 --> 01:10:23.270
<v Speaker 2>take chances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>

1709
01:10:23.271 --> 01:10:26.300
<v Speaker 2>there's a disproportionate number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycle victims,</v>

1710
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:29.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of crashes that have toxoplasmosis</v>

1711
01:10:29.961 --> 01:10:30.920
<v Speaker 2>infection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1712
01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This came from Robert Sapolsky,</v>

1713
01:10:32.481 --> 01:10:34.220
<v Speaker 2>his work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a professor at Stanford.</v>

1714
01:10:34.221 --> 01:10:37.040
<v Speaker 2>We had a chance to interview him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating guy.</v>

1715
01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:37.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1716
01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:38.840
<v Speaker 2>a lot of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1717
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:43.090
<v Speaker 2>his work he's done on toxoplasmosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think there's other,</v>

1718
01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.950
<v Speaker 2>a lot of other things like that that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't realize that affect human</v>

1719
01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:46.580
<v Speaker 2>behavior?</v>

1720
01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:47.900
<v Speaker 2>There could very well be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1721
01:10:47.901 --> 01:10:50.620
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of different parasites</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people get and you know,</v>

1722
01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:52.940
<v Speaker 2>there was another guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1723
01:10:52.941 --> 01:10:57.890
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hortense out of University of Houston.</v>

1724
01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Peter Hotez dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1725
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:06.950
<v Speaker 2>he's an infectious disease expert who</v>
<v Speaker 2>specializes in same television show that</v>

1726
01:11:07.581 --> 01:11:12.581
<v Speaker 2>I worked with you and he said that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that live in jungle,</v>

1727
01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:19.460
<v Speaker 2>literally 100 percent percent of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent are infected with parasites</v>

1728
01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:22.380
<v Speaker 2>while various parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some documented,</v>

1729
01:11:22.381 --> 01:11:23.560
<v Speaker 2>some undocumented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1730
01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:24.690
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1731
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:27.420
<v Speaker 2>And many of them control behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1732
01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:29.520
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some of them that are really</v>

1733
01:11:29.521 --> 01:11:30.370
<v Speaker 2>creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's one,</v>

1734
01:11:30.371 --> 01:11:34.290
<v Speaker 2>there's an aquatic worm that talks at</v>
<v Speaker 2>grasshopper and drowning so that it can</v>

1735
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:37.890
<v Speaker 2>give birth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it literally gets into the</v>

1736
01:11:37.891 --> 01:11:41.370
<v Speaker 2>grasshoppers brain rewires it's brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tells the grasshopper to jump into the</v>

1737
01:11:41.371 --> 01:11:44.340
<v Speaker 2>water so it can come out of its body and</v>
<v Speaker 2>exist in the water.</v>

1738
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.060
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing when you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1739
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:50.880
<v Speaker 2>How those things have developed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do exactly specifically what</v>

1740
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:52.740
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things need them to do.</v>

1741
01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:54.930
<v Speaker 2>So that's something else can benefit</v>
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>

1742
01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:57.060
<v Speaker 2>Is that what his name is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I wanted to get a benefit.</v>

1743
01:11:57.370 --> 01:11:59.440
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to find it out.</v>

1744
01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:02.580
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't cut down it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Peter Hotez.</v>

1745
01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.740
<v Speaker 2>Ortez Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1746
01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:06.790
<v Speaker 2>University of Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1747
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I can find it pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure anyway,</v>

1748
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:14.430
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean your friend probably just like</v>

1749
01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:17.250
<v Speaker 2>fucking with people and you'd probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like this guy's a dummy.</v>

1750
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep fucking with these dummies.</v>

1751
01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I wanted to.</v>

1752
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you did that.</v>

1753
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:26.780
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was doing the right thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't realize that these people</v>

1754
01:12:26.781 --> 01:12:29.010
<v Speaker 2>are going to become my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating with them every day.</v>

1755
01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.510
<v Speaker 2>They've got these lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1756
01:12:30.511 --> 01:12:34.620
<v Speaker 2>and I care about people and at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>point I know that I'm going to have to</v>

1757
01:12:34.621 --> 01:12:37.470
<v Speaker 2>come out and it's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>devastating for them.</v>

1758
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:38.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did it for years,</v>

1759
01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:41.760
<v Speaker 2>got tenure at the university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to look like an idiot at the</v>

1760
01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.940
<v Speaker 2>end of this and that wasn't my purpose</v>
<v Speaker 2>of doing it much bigger picture.</v>

1761
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>

1762
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:49.350
<v Speaker 2>but that is what he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1763
01:12:49.351 --> 01:12:49.890
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1764
01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:51.540
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a much bigger picture.</v>

1765
01:12:51.541 --> 01:12:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I would do the same thing again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just protect myself emotionally,</v>

1766
01:12:56.191 --> 01:13:00.210
<v Speaker 2>I think more than I did then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you went to become friends with.</v>

1767
01:13:00.211 --> 01:13:04.410
<v Speaker 2>I would not become close friends with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't share a lot of my life with</v>

1768
01:13:04.411 --> 01:13:06.060
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to learn about their</v>

1769
01:13:06.061 --> 01:13:09.130
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to keep it much more maybe than</v>

1770
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:11.910
<v Speaker 2>you dragged it on for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1771
01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if you just did it over a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>of days,</v>

1772
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:15.910
<v Speaker 2>no way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1773
01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:18.210
<v Speaker 2>we would have days where we would do</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

1774
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Like we literally sat in the lab and</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing would happen for an entire.</v>

1775
01:13:21.721 --> 01:13:23.270
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1776
01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Do that shit over four years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1777
01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:26.543
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1778
01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:28.740
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit misleading because it's 180</v>

1779
01:13:28.741 --> 01:13:32.930
<v Speaker 2>hours total and what that means is we'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out on holidays were coming out</v>

1780
01:13:32.931 --> 01:13:37.300
<v Speaker 2>on weekends would coming out on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're extending this project for a long</v>

1781
01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:39.510
<v Speaker 2>time and we weren't making money at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1782
01:13:39.511 --> 01:13:41.400
<v Speaker 2>there was a podium that paid for our</v>
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>

1783
01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.610
<v Speaker 2>but that's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1784
01:13:42.650 --> 01:13:43.840
<v Speaker 2>You were just doing it for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>procedure.</v>

1785
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:45.810
<v Speaker 2>I lost money because I had to take time</v>
<v Speaker 2>off work.</v>

1786
01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:47.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1787
01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I think it's what you did as a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1788
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Document because you show that even</v>

1789
01:13:53.611 --> 01:13:57.150
<v Speaker 2>scientists can be tricked if they're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>really following the scientific method</v>

1790
01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:00.960
<v Speaker 2>and that was the way to do it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were even some psychologist who</v>

1791
01:14:00.961 --> 01:14:01.620
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1792
01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:03.780
<v Speaker 2>if you think you can infiltrate a</v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratory,</v>

1793
01:14:03.781 --> 01:14:04.470
<v Speaker 2>go ahead and do it.</v>

1794
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:08.640
<v Speaker 2>So we were doing things in accordance</v>
<v Speaker 2>with what some of the psychological as a</v>

1795
01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 2>psychologist we actually saying we</v>
<v Speaker 2>should do for sure.</v>

1796
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the whole game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The game is you're supposed to be.</v>

1797
01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.900
<v Speaker 2>They're supposed to try to find out if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're tricking them.</v>

1798
01:14:19.901 --> 01:14:21.760
<v Speaker 2>So they should be assuming you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>tricking them.</v>

1799
01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're not assuming you're tricking</v>

1800
01:14:24.131 --> 01:14:25.720
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're tricking themselves and that is</v>

1801
01:14:25.721 --> 01:14:28.630
<v Speaker 2>part of the problem with psychics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a friend of mine went to a</v>

1802
01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:30.040
<v Speaker 2>psychic and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

1803
01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:31.270
<v Speaker 2>He knew all about my grandma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1804
01:14:31.271 --> 01:14:33.430
<v Speaker 2>don't you know about your grandma?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1805
01:14:33.431 --> 01:14:35.860
<v Speaker 2>if this motherfucker really knows</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychic,</v>

1806
01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.070
<v Speaker 2>he really knows his psychic power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to tell you some shit you</v>

1807
01:14:39.071 --> 01:14:41.110
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Telling you things about your life.</v>

1808
01:14:41.111 --> 01:14:43.750
<v Speaker 2>You already know I don't need anybody to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me about my life.</v>

1809
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1810
01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:48.580
<v Speaker 2>That's all they're doing and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways to get that info from you without</v>

1811
01:14:48.581 --> 01:14:50.770
<v Speaker 2>you realizing what I was saying this to</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend,</v>

1812
01:14:50.771 --> 01:14:54.940
<v Speaker 2>he did not want to listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to believe so strong and he</v>

1813
01:14:54.941 --> 01:14:56.740
<v Speaker 2>definitely didn't want to believe they</v>
<v Speaker 2>got tricked.</v>

1814
01:14:57.010 --> 01:14:58.750
<v Speaker 2>This is part of the problem with</v>
<v Speaker 2>scammers.</v>

1815
01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen some of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>scammers,</v>

1816
01:15:00.491 --> 01:15:02.770
<v Speaker 2>those Nigerian scammers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get these poor,</v>

1817
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:06.220
<v Speaker 2>lonely Melina to think that women are</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting for them in Europe?</v>

1818
01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.920
<v Speaker 2>There was a terrible television show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean terrible in that.</v>

1819
01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:14.130
<v Speaker 2>It was so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one guy flew to Europe twice to be</v>

1820
01:15:14.141 --> 01:15:18.430
<v Speaker 2>with this woman and every time he flew</v>
<v Speaker 2>there she had something come up and meet</v>

1821
01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:19.960
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was devastating.</v>

1822
01:15:19.961 --> 01:15:24.250
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't meet him and he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept going back and his daughter was</v>

1823
01:15:24.251 --> 01:15:27.250
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1824
01:15:27.251 --> 01:15:27.970
<v Speaker 2>scam.</v>

01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:29.860
<v Speaker 2>He really believes this woman's waiting</v>
<v Speaker 2>for him.</v>

1826
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:33.880
<v Speaker 2>He's never heard this woman's voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She says she can't talk on the phone,</v>

1827
01:15:33.881 --> 01:15:34.630
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:37.820
<v Speaker 2>she sends pictures and he really</v>
<v Speaker 2>believes strongly.</v>

1829
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:39.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>compliments that I've ever had actually</v>

1833
01:15:48.761 --> 01:15:50.400

<v Speaker 2>Penn said that if we didn't know you</v>

<v Speaker 2>you were the most convincing psychic</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've ever seen.</v>

01:16:08.081 --> 01:16:09.970
<v Speaker 2>that performance for us on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1842
01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:13.780
<v Speaker 2>that is the craziest shit if you weren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>so adamant that what you were doing was</v>

1843
01:16:13.781 --> 01:16:14.614
<v Speaker 2>a trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1849
01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:32.280
<v Speaker 2>So for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is nice that you can play off of</v>

1850
01:16:32.281 --> 01:16:32.710
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>

1851
01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:34.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1852
01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:34.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1853
01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:35.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1854
01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.720
<v Speaker 2>my house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it showed for that exact reason,</v>

1855
01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:42.790
<v Speaker 2>the show I'm doing in Rochester,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called telepathy and the first half</v>

1856
01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:45.370
<v Speaker 2>usually it's gonna be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't actually have to hats,</v>

1857
01:16:45.371 --> 01:16:47.290
<v Speaker 2>but normally I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normally it's a two hour show,</v>

1858
01:16:47.291 --> 01:16:51.670
<v Speaker 2>but I've had to cut it down to an hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>show and the first half was always me</v>

1859
01:16:51.671 --> 01:16:54.490
<v Speaker 2>coming out talking about telepathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is telepathy?</v>

1860
01:16:54.491 --> 01:16:56.710
<v Speaker 2>What did Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he believed it was radio waves.</v>

1861
01:16:56.711 --> 01:17:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Marie Curie believed that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>telepathy was a real way that he even</v>

1862
01:17:00.610 --> 01:17:02.170
<v Speaker 2>wrote the foreword to a book called</v>
<v Speaker 2>telepathy.</v>

1863
01:17:02.171 --> 01:17:02.801
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1864
01:17:02.801 --> 01:17:05.020
<v Speaker 2>he believed it was a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believed your mind give out radio</v>

1865
01:17:05.021 --> 01:17:08.710
<v Speaker 2>waves that other people actually picked</v>
<v Speaker 2>up a Sigmund Freud believed it was</v>

1866
01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:09.950
<v Speaker 2>related,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dream state,</v>

1867
01:17:09.951 --> 01:17:11.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was all these different third</v>

1868
01:17:11.241 --> 01:17:11.540
<v Speaker 2>theories.</v>

1869
01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:12.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the word was coined in,</v>

1870
01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:15.530
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>42 by uh,</v>

1871
01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Frederick Myers and he believes certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>things about telepathy.</v>

1872
01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:21.290
<v Speaker 2>So there was all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1873
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:23.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I start off a Conan doyle who wrote</v>

1874
01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Sherlock Holmes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1875
01:17:24.051 --> 01:17:28.460
<v Speaker 2>most rational character in literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believed that with spirits all around</v>

1876
01:17:28.461 --> 01:17:29.690
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could pluck a thought out of one</v>

1877
01:17:29.691 --> 01:17:31.250
<v Speaker 2>person's mind and actually put it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

1878
01:17:31.251 --> 01:17:34.170
<v Speaker 2>So he believed all prognostication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these things have to do this,</v>

1879
01:17:34.410 --> 01:17:36.470
<v Speaker 2>had to do with spiritualism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's all these people.</v>

1880
01:17:36.471 --> 01:17:37.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean the US government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1881
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:41.000
<v Speaker 2>about Star Gate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gave $20,000,000 in the seventies</v>

1882
01:17:41.001 --> 01:17:45.170
<v Speaker 2>going on into the nineties to study and</v>
<v Speaker 2>find out if this stuff had any practical</v>

1883
01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.020
<v Speaker 2>military applications on these type of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1884
01:17:48.021 --> 01:17:49.570
<v Speaker 2>So remote viewing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell it.</v>

1885
01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:51.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's where remote viewing came</v>

1886
01:17:51.261 --> 01:17:52.290
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing,</v>

1887
01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:56.360
<v Speaker 2>stargate not cured me of that television</v>
<v Speaker 2>show did try to do that.</v>

1888
01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.460
<v Speaker 2>You did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you actually did that with the,</v>

1889
01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.160
<v Speaker 2>with Dj growthy on there as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1891
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:03.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was part of that,</v>

1892
01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:07.280
<v Speaker 2>but of that Dj,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and Dj both did better.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1894
01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:13.970

<v Speaker 2>some stick figures.</v>

1895
01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:16.840
<v Speaker 2>That's how that can be the tower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the tower is about.</v>

1896
01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:18.800

<v Speaker 2>but it looks like a tower.</v>

1897
01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was the one guy that's famous for</v>

1898

<v Speaker 2>girlfriend.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Can I remote viewer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you put it in my head right now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>demon ejaculation.</v>

1913
01:19:02.511 --> 01:19:05.300
<v Speaker 2>And</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

1914
01:19:05.310 --> 01:19:08.870
<v Speaker 2>since that time I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gone after many different things.</v>

1915
01:19:08.871 --> 01:19:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Popoff,</v>

1916
01:19:10.221 --> 01:19:12.290
<v Speaker 2>the evangelist said he was getting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>word of God.</v>

1917
01:19:12.291 --> 01:19:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Randy came to Houston in 1986.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The earpiece in?</v>

1918
01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:16.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found the earpiece.</v>

1919
01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you found that it was me.</v>

1920
01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Randy was writing an article,</v>

1921
01:19:20.841 --> 01:19:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Hustler magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those magazines on</v>

1922
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:25.320
<v Speaker 2>evangelists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evangelists.</v>

1923
01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.930
<v Speaker 2>It was a good place to hide something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the things.</v>

1924
01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:32.140
<v Speaker 2>It may not have been hustled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't want you to quote me on that.</v>

1925
01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:34.770
<v Speaker 2>That house did a lot of those and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying.</v>

1926
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:36.870
<v Speaker 2>I didn't Penthouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it plays a lot.</v>

1927
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:39.650
<v Speaker 2>I think it was hustling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I could be wrong is one of the ones</v>

1928
01:19:39.651 --> 01:19:42.650
<v Speaker 2>that people actually read because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls never take their panties off.</v>

1929
01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:45.530
<v Speaker 2>So you get bored with just looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>now though it didn't.</v>

1930
01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:48.140
<v Speaker 2>They go back to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they don't know they were.</v>

1931
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:51.470
<v Speaker 2>They went to looking after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did not do it at all.</v>

1932
01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1933
01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show amazing willpower.</v>

1934
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:58.610
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went to the key needs or underwear.</v>

1935
01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:03.330
<v Speaker 2>They stopped taking their clothes off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then sales inexplicably tank.</v>

1936
01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:05.600
<v Speaker 2>It's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those articles,</v>

<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

<v Speaker 3>pop off comes out on stage.</v>

1954
01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:39.900
<v Speaker 3>He starts saying he's getting the word</v>
<v Speaker 3>of God.</v>

1955
01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:43.040
<v Speaker 3>He's telling people their names,</v>
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>

1956
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:44.970
<v Speaker 3>who their doctors are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what their ailments are,</v>

<v Speaker 3>People have cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He starts healing people of blindness.</v>

1959
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:51.960
<v Speaker 3>People walking again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was really,</v>

1960
01:20:51.961 --> 01:20:53.670
<v Speaker 3>really emotionally for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tears in my eyes,</v>

1961
01:20:53.671 --> 01:20:57.270
<v Speaker 3>but I knew that was all bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had to news bullshit and crying.</v>

1962
01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:01.650
<v Speaker 3>It can you get this whole fucking life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you see a little kid crying</v>

1963
01:21:01.651 --> 01:21:03.240
<v Speaker 3>and running down the aisle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1964
01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.490
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to get angry,</v>

1965
01:21:05.491 --> 01:21:07.980
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just so emotional.</v>

1966
01:21:07.981 --> 01:21:10.020
<v Speaker 3>It's just the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get caught up in this whole thing.</v>

1967
01:21:10.021 --> 01:21:13.680
<v Speaker 3>It's just new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he asked for people to collect money.</v>

1968
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.750
<v Speaker 3>He's just asking random people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up,</v>

1969
01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:17.130
<v Speaker 3>grab a bucket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go collect money.</v>

1970
01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.230
<v Speaker 3>I got down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was like the 15th bucket.</v>

1971
01:21:19.231 --> 01:21:21.360
<v Speaker 3>I got my bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walk around,</v>

1972
01:21:21.361 --> 01:21:22.680
<v Speaker 3>I get checks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got probably about,</v>

1973
01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:24.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 grand,</v>

1974
01:21:24.091 --> 01:21:24.830
<v Speaker 3>20 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1975
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:26.130
<v Speaker 3>You know what I've got?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean money.</v>

1976
01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.000
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting money.</v>

1977
01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:28.750
<v Speaker 3>Then you've got to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm think I'm done.</v>

1978
01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:29.250
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>

1979
01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:29.761
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1980
01:21:29.761 --> 01:21:32.910
<v Speaker 3>Once you got to go back out and collect</v>
<v Speaker 3>checks and now we're going out getting</v>

1981
01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:35.310
<v Speaker 3>checks in the bucket and then it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>go out,</v>

1982
01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.040
<v Speaker 3>get sealed offerings and people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropping envelopes in there with like</v>

1983
01:21:38.041 --> 01:21:40.050
<v Speaker 3>watches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rings and stuff like that.</v>

1984
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:43.470
<v Speaker 3>As I come back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hand the bucket up to pop off and I</v>

1985
01:21:43.471 --> 01:21:46.590
<v Speaker 3>look up and I noticed that he's got a</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of plastic in his ear.</v>

1986
01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:49.860
<v Speaker 3>I go back to randy and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Randy,</v>

1987
01:21:49.861 --> 01:21:50.370
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1988
01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:53.700
<v Speaker 3>either this man of God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God doesn't like him enough to heal him</v>

1989
01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:56.760
<v Speaker 3>and he's got a hearing aid or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>else is going on.</v>

1990
01:21:56.761 --> 01:21:58.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but something else is going on and I</v>

1991
01:21:58.921 --> 01:22:00.450
<v Speaker 3>think that's how he's getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

1992
01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:01.321
<v Speaker 3>And Randy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1993
01:22:01.321 --> 01:22:03.840
<v Speaker 3>he's using mnemonics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mnemonics that basically memory systems.</v>

1994
01:22:03.841 --> 01:22:04.920
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1995
01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:06.840
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to use a lot of mnemonics to</v>

1996
01:22:06.841 --> 01:22:11.550
<v Speaker 3>memorize things because otherwise I have</v>
<v Speaker 3>major issues and I know a lot about</v>

1997
01:22:11.551 --> 01:22:13.740
<v Speaker 3>mnemonics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You either memorize a lot of bad things</v>

1998
01:22:13.741 --> 01:22:16.980
<v Speaker 3>about a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh you memorize a few things about a lot</v>

1999
01:22:16.981 --> 01:22:19.080
<v Speaker 3>of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't memorize a lot of things</v>

2000
01:22:19.081 --> 01:22:20.490
<v Speaker 3>about a lot of things.</v>

2001
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:23.010
<v Speaker 3>And he was memorizing a lot of things</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a lot of things.</v>

2002
01:22:23.011 --> 01:22:23.890
<v Speaker 3>If that was the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2003
01:22:23.970 --> 01:22:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they went out to the next pet,</v>

2004
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.570
<v Speaker 3>pop off a congregation thing when she</v>
<v Speaker 3>was in San Francisco,</v>

2005
01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:33.990
<v Speaker 3>got a friend of ours from a Alec,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jason,</v>

2006
01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:35.110
<v Speaker 3>I think his name is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2007
01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:39.870
<v Speaker 3>from a WHO's an electronics engineer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was everything about electronics.</v>

2008
01:22:39.871 --> 01:22:43.800
<v Speaker 3>And he brought this little scanner and</v>
<v Speaker 3>dressed up as a security guard hanging</v>

2009
01:22:43.801 --> 01:22:45.720
<v Speaker 3>out in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was scared to death he was going</v>

2010
01:22:45.721 --> 01:22:47.250
<v Speaker 3>to get called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody questioned him.</v>

2011
01:22:47.251 --> 01:22:51.030
<v Speaker 3>He's there in a security outfit and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>scans all the frequencies ahead of time</v>

2012
01:22:51.031 --> 01:22:54.570
<v Speaker 3>and he blocks out every one of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>frequencies that are known frequencies.</v>

2013
01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:00.320
<v Speaker 3>The moment pop off hits the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a brand new frequency pops up and turns</v>

2014
01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:05.070
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a 37 point.</v>

2015
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.840
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you in just a second here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was A.</v>

2016
01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

2017
01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:11.290
<v Speaker 3>was that the frequency that he was on</v>
<v Speaker 3>was?</v>

2018
01:23:11.291 --> 01:23:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was right.</v>

2019
01:23:12.251 --> 01:23:13.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 nine point seven megahertz.</v>

2020
01:23:13.991 --> 01:23:17.490
<v Speaker 3>That's what God broadcasts on and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>sounds an awful lot like Peter popoff</v>

2021
01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:21.940
<v Speaker 3>wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what we did was we taped all this and</v>

2022
01:23:21.941 --> 01:23:24.130
<v Speaker 3>went to the Johnny Carson show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how long ago that was.</v>

2023
01:23:24.131 --> 01:23:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Now on this night show with Johnny</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carson.</v>

2024
01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:31.500
<v Speaker 3>Randy takes it on the tonight show and</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep in mind that I'm pop off with tape</v>

2025
01:23:31.991 --> 01:23:35.710
<v Speaker 3>every single one of his shows and sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of edit it real time as well.</v>

2026
01:23:36.370 --> 01:23:37.810
<v Speaker 3>You put them on television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2027
01:23:37.811 --> 01:23:40.160
<v Speaker 3>it will put them all on television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how we make tons of.</v>

2028
01:23:40.161 --> 01:23:41.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a,</v>

2029
01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:45.790
<v Speaker 3>a monthly budget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like $550,000 every</v>

2030
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:46.520
<v Speaker 3>single month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2031
01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.060
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2032
01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:47.501
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2033
01:23:47.501 --> 01:23:49.510
<v Speaker 3>that was a working budget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's not the money.</v>

2034
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:51.250
<v Speaker 3>They will actually make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So God knows how much.</v>

2035
01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.500
<v Speaker 3>So that's how much they were spending so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much they were spending.</v>

2036
01:23:53.501 --> 01:23:53.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2037
01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:54.530
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2038
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:56.260
<v Speaker 3>So God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a dirty business.</v>

2039
01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so dirty.</v>

2040
01:23:58.151 --> 01:24:00.520
<v Speaker 3>It's so dirty to just lie to people like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2041
01:24:00.521 --> 01:24:02.740
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I would make a great evangelists if I</v>

2042
01:24:02.741 --> 01:24:04.720
<v Speaker 3>wasn't ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are times like,</v>

2043
01:24:04.721 --> 01:24:05.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2044
01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:07.720
<v Speaker 3>but I just couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do it.</v>

2045
01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:11.740
<v Speaker 3>So on the tonight show they play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they play the footage that they have</v>

2046
01:24:11.741 --> 01:24:15.970
<v Speaker 3>from his TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They play all that and then they.</v>

2047
01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was the one time that Johnny</v>

2048
01:24:18.161 --> 01:24:19.810
<v Speaker 3>always wanted to know everything that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to happen.</v>

2049
01:24:19.811 --> 01:24:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Like she didn't want any surprises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his staff said,</v>

2050
01:24:22.211 --> 01:24:22.681
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2051
01:24:22.681 --> 01:24:24.640
<v Speaker 3>you want to be surprised by this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trust this.</v>

2052
01:24:25.210 --> 01:24:28.550
<v Speaker 3>So sure enough they play that footage</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they play the footage with pop</v>

2053
01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:31.720
<v Speaker 3>offs wife and she's saying things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>pd.</v>

2054
01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:32.890
<v Speaker 3>The first thing she says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>PD,</v>

2055
01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:35.140
<v Speaker 3>nod your head if you can hear me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you don't,</v>

2056
01:24:35.141 --> 01:24:38.410
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have trouble tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He nods his head as he's talking,</v>

2057
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:40.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this whole event gelical thing.</v>

2058
01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2059
01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.380
<v Speaker 3>then she starts saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2060
01:24:44.381 --> 01:24:47.200
<v Speaker 3>there's a live one up in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's got cancer in her breast and make</v>

2061
01:24:47.201 --> 01:24:49.300
<v Speaker 3>her run up and down the island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shake those breaths,</v>

2062
01:24:49.301 --> 01:24:50.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just always like re.</v>

2063
01:24:50.741 --> 01:24:53.830
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of nasty stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of that stuff we couldn't play on</v>

2064
01:24:53.831 --> 01:24:55.570
<v Speaker 3>this night show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we showed enough.</v>

2065
01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:59.080
<v Speaker 3>And so just a disdain the marketing of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people.</v>

2066
01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:04.080
<v Speaker 3>She actually had breast cancer and she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling that these people do these real</v>

2067
01:25:04.090 --> 01:25:05.380
<v Speaker 3>elements that all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2068
01:25:05.381 --> 01:25:08.380
<v Speaker 3>almost real elements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get to that in a second because we</v>

2069
01:25:08.381 --> 01:25:12.280
<v Speaker 3>sent some stitches in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

2070
01:25:12.281 --> 01:25:13.630
<v Speaker 3>just nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nasty stuff.</v>

2071
01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:14.980
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stuff we showed him the tonight</v>

2072
01:25:14.981 --> 01:25:16.900
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnny sits there and he never,</v>

2073
01:25:16.901 --> 01:25:20.350
<v Speaker 3>he didn't like to edit it shows either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had to edit this because a moment</v>

2074
01:25:20.351 --> 01:25:22.480
<v Speaker 3>that came on Johnny's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

2075
01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:24.100
<v Speaker 3>And you couldn't say shit on TV back</v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

2076
01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:27.180
<v Speaker 3>And so we had to edit that out at that</v>
<v Speaker 3>point and he says like,</v>

2077
01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:29.230
<v Speaker 3>do they know about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

2078
01:25:29.231 --> 01:25:30.160
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do now.</v>

2079
01:25:30.850 --> 01:25:33.580
<v Speaker 3>And at first pop off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to say that we,</v>

2080
01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:34.331
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2081
01:25:34.331 --> 01:25:36.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we hired actors to be his wife.</v>

2082
01:25:36.490 --> 01:25:38.320
<v Speaker 3>And then when it was obvious that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>

2083
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:41.260
<v Speaker 3>he then came out and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought everybody knew that I use that</v>

2084
01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:46.261
<v Speaker 3>to enhance the word of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it took a long time for him to go</v>

2085
01:25:46.661 --> 01:25:47.240
<v Speaker 3>onto that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>

2086
01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:50.320
<v Speaker 3>here's the crappy thing about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right when I was there,</v>

2087
01:25:50.321 --> 01:25:53.920
<v Speaker 3>he's doing stuff like telling people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw their medications up on stage.</v>

2088
01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.900
<v Speaker 3>You don't need them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God's going to take care of,</v>

2089
01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:57.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine somebody throws up some</v>

2090
01:25:57.251 --> 01:25:58.930
<v Speaker 3>digitalis pills or something they</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

2091
01:25:58.931 --> 01:26:00.730
<v Speaker 3>truly need and think God's going to heal</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2092
01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.750
<v Speaker 3>So people do die from these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was using a lot of other tricks.</v>

2093
01:26:04.770 --> 01:26:05.270
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2094
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:07.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm part of the way he was getting the</v>
<v Speaker 3>information was this,</v>

2095
01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:09.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people fill out prayer cards ahead of</v>

2096
01:26:09.801 --> 01:26:13.790
<v Speaker 3>time and they put them in these boxes in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the back of the room when nobody's</v>

2097
01:26:13.791 --> 01:26:16.640
<v Speaker 3>really paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the boxes get switched out.</v>

2098
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:20.370
<v Speaker 3>So all those prayer cards with all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>information goes backstage.</v>

2099
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:22.940
<v Speaker 3>So the wife and she's able to send that</v>
<v Speaker 3>information to him.</v>

2100
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:25.100
<v Speaker 3>Another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would come out on stage,</v>

2101
01:26:25.101 --> 01:26:27.230
<v Speaker 3>she would come out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people come to these things for hours</v>

2102
01:26:27.230 --> 01:26:28.700
<v Speaker 3>and hours ahead of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally and they leave the</v>

2103
01:26:28.701 --> 01:26:32.450
<v Speaker 3>hospital on carts and everything else</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she would walk and she said,</v>

2104
01:26:32.451 --> 01:26:33.610
<v Speaker 3>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Mrs Popoff go.</v>

2105
01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:35.720
<v Speaker 3>I hope my husband gets to you tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2106
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:36.561
<v Speaker 3>where are you from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2107
01:26:36.561 --> 01:26:37.061
<v Speaker 3>that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2108
01:26:37.061 --> 01:26:38.690
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh I'm so well.</v>

2109
01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.850
<v Speaker 3>I'll pray for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she gets all this information again.</v>

2110
01:26:40.851 --> 01:26:42.710
<v Speaker 3>She'd go back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had a big tape recorder in her purse</v>

2111
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:44.660
<v Speaker 3>and she would write that information</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

2112
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:49.460
<v Speaker 3>Another one was what I call like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kathryn Kuhlman trick and Catherine</v>

2113
01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:52.280
<v Speaker 3>Coleman was an evangelist way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way back who had all these great,</v>

2114
01:26:52.281 --> 01:26:55.970
<v Speaker 3>great little like scam trick things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what they do is they wait for</v>

2115
01:26:55.971 --> 01:27:00.971
<v Speaker 3>somebody to come walk in with a cane and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they can walk but not well,</v>

2116
01:27:01.191 --> 01:27:03.260
<v Speaker 3>and they're using a cane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They walk up to them and say,</v>

2117
01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:05.210
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't you be much more comfortable in</v>

2118
01:27:05.211 --> 01:27:06.890
<v Speaker 3>a wheelchair and we can put you up right</v>
<v Speaker 3>up front.</v>

2119
01:27:06.891 --> 01:27:09.710
<v Speaker 3>You'll be right next to the reverend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to say no to that?</v>

2120
01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.630
<v Speaker 3>So they get pushed up in the wheelchair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as I pushed them along,</v>

2121
01:27:12.631 --> 01:27:13.041
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2122
01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:15.500
<v Speaker 3>you're from WHO's your doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's wrong with getting all</v>

2123
01:27:15.501 --> 01:27:17.240
<v Speaker 3>this information?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go back out,</v>

2124
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:19.390
<v Speaker 3>write the information down and giving</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mrs Popoff.</v>

2125
01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:23.090
<v Speaker 3>So the wheelchair sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reverent comes out.</v>

2126
01:27:23.091 --> 01:27:24.890
<v Speaker 3>At some point he can look at that</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

2127
01:27:24.891 --> 01:27:26.120
<v Speaker 3>He didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said so name.</v>

2128
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.740
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've never talked before.</v>

2129
01:27:27.741 --> 01:27:29.000
<v Speaker 3>We've never met before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have we?</v>

2130
01:27:29.001 --> 01:27:31.880
<v Speaker 3>Because they haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the usher that was pushing him</v>

2131
01:27:31.881 --> 01:27:33.680
<v Speaker 3>down to gut that info.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2132
01:27:33.681 --> 01:27:35.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God says you can be healed.</v>

2133
01:27:35.061 --> 01:27:35.820
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God said,</v>

2134
01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:37.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting from God that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk.</v>

2135
01:27:37.491 --> 01:27:39.560
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guy sitting there,</v>

2136
01:27:39.561 --> 01:27:41.030
<v Speaker 3>he's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a man of God,</v>

2137
01:27:41.031 --> 01:27:43.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not contradicting him.</v>

2138
01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:45.950
<v Speaker 3>And he must mean never be at a walk</v>
<v Speaker 3>properly again.</v>

2139
01:27:45.951 --> 01:27:46.790
<v Speaker 3>That's what he's saying.</v>

2140
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:49.040
<v Speaker 3>He's saying that my doctor says I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>never walk properly again.</v>

2141
01:27:49.041 --> 01:27:51.050
<v Speaker 3>So he doesn't contradict him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2142
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:54.230
<v Speaker 3>I say you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God says you can stand up.</v>

2143
01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:56.360
<v Speaker 3>The man stands up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2144
01:27:56.361 --> 01:27:58.340
<v Speaker 3>that's your first miracle because</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else,</v>

2145
01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:01.730
<v Speaker 3>their perception is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys in that wheelchair cannot walk.</v>

2146
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:04.250
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a few steps that it takes a few</v>

2147
01:28:04.251 --> 01:28:05.450
<v Speaker 3>steps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got that beat,</v>

2148
01:28:05.451 --> 01:28:06.081
<v Speaker 3>it's war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2149
01:28:06.081 --> 01:28:07.790
<v Speaker 3>So now you've got the emotion going even</v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

2150
01:28:07.791 --> 01:28:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Because here's a man that couldn't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk.</v>

2151
01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:12.860
<v Speaker 3>He stood and now he walked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop off,</v>

2152
01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:15.380
<v Speaker 3>then goes and gets in the wheelchair and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sits in it.</v>

2153
01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:17.990
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk to the back of the wheelchair and</v>

2154
01:28:17.991 --> 01:28:19.670
<v Speaker 3>the guy hobbles to the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wheelchair.</v>

2155
01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:20.773
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>push me.</v>

2156
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:23.150
<v Speaker 3>And the guy pushes him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real miracle,</v>

2157
01:28:23.151 --> 01:28:24.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But think about it.</v>

2158
01:28:24.111 --> 01:28:26.390
<v Speaker 3>That will chair is now acting like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fricken walker.</v>

2159
01:28:27.230 --> 01:28:30.390
<v Speaker 3>And then the great climax of the whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of this trick is he takes the</v>

2160
01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:31.820
<v Speaker 3>wheelchair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>puts it back where it is,</v>

2161
01:28:31.821 --> 01:28:33.200
<v Speaker 3>and he says to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that's your wheelchair,</v>

2162
01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:35.210
<v Speaker 3>meaning Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you got up right now,</v>

2163
01:28:35.211 --> 01:28:36.290
<v Speaker 3>walked across the room and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

2164
01:28:36.291 --> 01:28:37.400
<v Speaker 3>that's your chair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd say,</v>

2165
01:28:37.401 --> 01:28:39.440
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will it actually is your jail.</v>

2166
01:28:39.441 --> 01:28:41.520
<v Speaker 3>You own it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean in normal circumstances I say</v>

2167
01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:42.620
<v Speaker 3>you were in my studio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd go,</v>

2168
01:28:42.621 --> 01:28:44.720
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean that your chair,</v>

2169
01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:46.710
<v Speaker 3>it just means it's where you're sitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that moment.</v>

2170
01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.910
<v Speaker 3>So the permits and sits down and you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen this whole miracle.</v>

2171
01:28:49.911 --> 01:28:53.450
<v Speaker 3>So he's got all these tricks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The old trick of one leg is longer than</v>

2172
01:28:53.451 --> 01:28:55.560
<v Speaker 3>the other and you make them both the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same size.</v>

2173
01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:57.410
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get caught up in the moment and</v>

2174
01:28:57.411 --> 01:28:59.690
<v Speaker 3>they're on television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want it to be real.</v>

2175
01:28:59.690 --> 01:29:02.440
<v Speaker 3>And the good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think an interesting.</v>

2176
01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.980
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think so.</v>

2177
01:29:04.981 --> 01:29:07.500
<v Speaker 3>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is more of a religious</v>

2178
01:29:07.501 --> 01:29:10.140
<v Speaker 3>thing that people truly believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you have.</v>

2179
01:29:10.141 --> 01:29:12.300
<v Speaker 3>It's like when I was talking tongues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was yelling,</v>

2180
01:29:12.301 --> 01:29:13.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got all this stuff,</v>

2181
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:15.440
<v Speaker 3>me and I got all this adrenaline flowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>through my body.</v>

2182
01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:18.180
<v Speaker 3>When you get caught up in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like when I was watching it,</v>

2183
01:29:18.181 --> 01:29:19.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting caught up.</v>

2184
01:29:19.201 --> 01:29:22.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm having all this reaction in my body</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite the fact I know it's all</v>

2185
01:29:22.201 --> 01:29:24.330
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still having this,</v>

2186
01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:25.860
<v Speaker 3>this entire reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2187
01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:26.933
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2188
01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:28.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mediums to me.</v>

2189
01:29:28.591 --> 01:29:32.040
<v Speaker 3>The worst scum out there right now are</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mediums and why do I say that?</v>

2190
01:29:32.041 --> 01:29:34.590
<v Speaker 3>Because they're taking advantage of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person in a vulnerable moment in their</v>

2191
01:29:34.591 --> 01:29:36.870
<v Speaker 3>life and they're doing it for that long</v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

2192
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:39.150
<v Speaker 3>They're also doing it for money and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people will say,</v>

2193
01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:42.000
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then making them feel good.</v>

2194
01:29:42.630 --> 01:29:44.370
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can give crack to a junkie.</v>

2195
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:45.930
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean it's good for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2196
01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:50.040
<v Speaker 3>The grieving process is a natural part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the state that you have to go through</v>

2197
01:29:50.041 --> 01:29:53.730
<v Speaker 3>to stay with the living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a very good friend whose son died</v>

2198
01:29:53.731 --> 01:29:55.230
<v Speaker 3>of cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years old,</v>

2199
01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:58.680
<v Speaker 3>died of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's understanding he has this huge</v>

2200
01:29:58.681 --> 01:29:59.640
<v Speaker 3>gaping hole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2201
01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.910
<v Speaker 3>is huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gaping hole,</v>

2202
01:30:00.911 --> 01:30:02.910
<v Speaker 3>which she's just feeling sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's upset,</v>

2203
01:30:02.911 --> 01:30:07.050
<v Speaker 3>she needs to fill it with something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Normally you turn to your family for</v>

2204
01:30:07.051 --> 01:30:08.370
<v Speaker 3>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she met.</v>

2205
01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:11.460
<v Speaker 3>She met a medium who convinced the she</v>
<v Speaker 3>could talk to her dead son,</v>

2206
01:30:12.090 --> 01:30:13.980
<v Speaker 3>so she stopped talking to her two living</v>
<v Speaker 3>daughters.</v>

2207
01:30:13.981 --> 01:30:16.290
<v Speaker 3>She stopped talking to her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she started talking to the meat,</v>

2208
01:30:16.291 --> 01:30:18.930
<v Speaker 3>even talking to her dead son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost ended up with a divorce,</v>

2209
01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:24.080
<v Speaker 3>almost lost her entire life as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this happens all the time and it is</v>

2210
01:30:24.091 --> 01:30:26.170
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so sad and dirty,</v>

2211
01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:29.670
<v Speaker 3>very dirty people on long island medium</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever watched.</v>

2212
01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:34.680
<v Speaker 3>So Theresa Caputo</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the worst part is the networks that</v>

2213
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:37.320
<v Speaker 3>edit the stuff to make it look even</v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

2214
01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:39.540
<v Speaker 3>If they don't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just trying to make money and</v>

2215
01:30:39.541 --> 01:30:41.760
<v Speaker 3>just try to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all they don't care about.</v>

2216
01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.820
<v Speaker 3>Somehow or another feel like they're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>a part of the scam.</v>

2217
01:30:44.850 --> 01:30:47.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're literally committing fraud.</v>

2218
01:30:47.130 --> 01:30:48.000
<v Speaker 3>They aren't there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2219
01:30:48.001 --> 01:30:49.680
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're perpetrating the fraud.</v>

2220
01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the network is not involved with what it</v>

2221
01:30:51.691 --> 01:30:52.950
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a production company.</v>

2222
01:30:53.250 --> 01:30:55.050
<v Speaker 3>The production company is bringing it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the network,</v>

2223
01:30:55.051 --> 01:30:59.550
<v Speaker 3>but the network should know the process</v>
<v Speaker 3>and knows what's going on.</v>

2224
01:30:59.551 --> 01:31:01.080
<v Speaker 3>They know it's bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>

2225
01:31:01.081 --> 01:31:03.210
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to get ratings.</v>

2226
01:31:03.211 --> 01:31:04.680
<v Speaker 3>It's going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's promote it,</v>

2227
01:31:04.681 --> 01:31:05.700
<v Speaker 3>let's push it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2228
01:31:05.701 --> 01:31:09.240
<v Speaker 3>they show up on set on Psi Phi and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>network.</v>

2229
01:31:09.241 --> 01:31:11.430
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want me just debunking</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2230
01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:12.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had to tell them,</v>

2231
01:31:12.631 --> 01:31:14.700
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is everything's bullshit.</v>

2232
01:31:14.701 --> 01:31:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that I'm trying to debunk</v>

2233
01:31:16.801 --> 01:31:18.600
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just really looking at it.</v>

2234
01:31:18.601 --> 01:31:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's bullshit.</v>

2235
01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:23.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's why in my show I started to go on</v>

2236
01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:26.130
<v Speaker 3>this a little bit ago that showed</v>
<v Speaker 3>telepathy where I talk about telepathy</v>

2237
01:31:26.131 --> 01:31:28.320
<v Speaker 3>and what it is and everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as I'm doing it,</v>

2238
01:31:28.321 --> 01:31:32.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm performing and there's a part in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that show where I feel really,</v>

2239
01:31:32.701 --> 01:31:35.370
<v Speaker 3>really dirty and I feel really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really bad,</v>

2240
01:31:35.371 --> 01:31:39.250
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like I have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I actually talked to some people's</v>

2241
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:42.540
<v Speaker 3>dead relatives in that show and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the most despicable,</v>

2242
01:31:42.541 --> 01:31:45.480
<v Speaker 3>horrible thing and it makes me want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>cry every time I do it,</v>

2243
01:31:45.930 --> 01:31:47.940
<v Speaker 3>but it's because in the second half of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the show I go,</v>

2244
01:31:47.941 --> 01:31:49.410
<v Speaker 3>what is telepathy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2245
01:31:49.411 --> 01:31:50.520
<v Speaker 3>I think I know what it is.</v>

2246
01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:52.050
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2247
01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:54.960
<v Speaker 3>a subset of magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a form of entertainment and</v>

2248
01:31:54.961 --> 01:31:58.460
<v Speaker 3>a very cruel form of entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I played with emotions if any of</v>

2249
01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:01.300
<v Speaker 3>you here this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how else can I convince you on an</v>

2250
01:32:01.301 --> 01:32:06.100
<v Speaker 3>emotional level?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on a logical level that is bullshit.</v>

2251
01:32:06.101 --> 01:32:07.030
<v Speaker 3>Because here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2252
01:32:07.031 --> 01:32:11.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've had this one experience that's</v>

2253
01:32:11.201 --> 01:32:14.590
<v Speaker 3>an emotional experience meeting the</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychic and the psychic telling them,</v>

2254
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:15.970
<v Speaker 3>if you tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2255
01:32:15.971 --> 01:32:18.700
<v Speaker 3>well I got this friend band check,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could do that same thing for you.</v>

2256
01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:19.541
<v Speaker 3>He's going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2257
01:32:19.541 --> 01:32:19.841
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2258
01:32:19.841 --> 01:32:21.040
<v Speaker 3>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2259
01:32:21.041 --> 01:32:23.470
<v Speaker 3>or if I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say Bennett checks are real soft,</v>

2260
01:32:23.490 --> 01:32:25.750
<v Speaker 3>they train us to meet up and then I do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2261
01:32:25.751 --> 01:32:26.381
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2262
01:32:26.381 --> 01:32:28.570
<v Speaker 3>that God's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then now you say it's bullshit,</v>

2263
01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:30.790
<v Speaker 3>now they'll think a little bit and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2264
01:32:30.791 --> 01:32:31.180
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2265
01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:34.060
<v Speaker 3>I had that same emotional experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had that same feeling.</v>

2266
01:32:34.570 --> 01:32:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Maybe maybe I'll look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My job,</v>

2267
01:32:36.911 --> 01:32:39.160
<v Speaker 3>I feel he's never to break down a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person's belief systems,</v>

2268
01:32:39.161 --> 01:32:40.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can believe whatever you want,</v>

2269
01:32:40.631 --> 01:32:41.351
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

2270
01:32:41.351 --> 01:32:42.880
<v Speaker 3>So long as you're not hurting anybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>

2271
01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:46.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm Kinda sorta okay with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the big thing is the problem that I</v>

2272
01:32:46.871 --> 01:32:50.440
<v Speaker 3>have is with the people that have taken</v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage of those people's beliefs,</v>

2273
01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:52.720
<v Speaker 3>cause it's always wolves in sheep's</v>
<v Speaker 3>clothing.</v>

2274
01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:55.480
<v Speaker 3>They're taking advantage of people go</v>
<v Speaker 3>down these side streets and there's</v>

2275
01:32:55.481 --> 01:32:58.300
<v Speaker 3>these houses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's little houses that are sided</v>

2276
01:32:58.390 --> 01:33:00.490
<v Speaker 3>houses where people live in them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them do,</v>

2277
01:33:00.491 --> 01:33:03.420
<v Speaker 3>like you look at those houses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like fricking like beautiful.</v>

2278
01:33:03.421 --> 01:33:08.020
<v Speaker 3>And they look like these people must be</v>
<v Speaker 3>making money like huge money somehow</v>

2279
01:33:08.021 --> 01:33:10.810
<v Speaker 3>unless they're laundering money or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something on the side as well.</v>

2280
01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:14.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's enough people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in.</v>

2281
01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:19.160
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately they're good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just hustle people and yeah,</v>

2282
01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:22.360
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird legal scam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to,</v>

2283
01:33:22.570 --> 01:33:26.530
<v Speaker 3>in order to like the government's</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly shutting down cults and all</v>

2284
01:33:26.531 --> 01:33:31.180
<v Speaker 3>sorts of things that are not legit that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they find to be dangerous,</v>

2285
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:33.310
<v Speaker 3>but they somehow or another allow</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2286
01:33:33.311 --> 01:33:36.160
<v Speaker 3>like some of them had got arrested</v>
<v Speaker 3>recently for scamming someone out of</v>

2287
01:33:36.161 --> 01:33:39.100
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of thousands of dollars and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the same sort of a thing.</v>

2288
01:33:39.101 --> 01:33:42.970
<v Speaker 3>She was a psychic and she was saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>that she needed all this money for.</v>

2289
01:33:42.971 --> 01:33:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for some fucking Mino about where I'll</v>

2290
01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:45.760
<v Speaker 3>frames,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2291
01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.260
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was like,</v>

2292
01:33:47.261 --> 01:33:47.980
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2293
01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:49.230
<v Speaker 3>I think he like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2294
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:53.680
<v Speaker 3>he was like a multi millions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars and there was a long</v>

2295
01:33:53.681 --> 01:33:56.470
<v Speaker 3>scan that went on for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a,</v>

2296
01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:57.040
<v Speaker 3>what was it?</v>

2297
01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.350
<v Speaker 3>I think I ever down there somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where.</v>

2298
01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:01.280
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>round frames,</v>

2299
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:01.930
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2300
01:34:01.930 --> 01:34:04.180
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he basically grew trees and replanted</v>

2301
01:34:04.181 --> 01:34:07.180
<v Speaker 3>trees and old trees and everything he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said made millions and millions off</v>

2302
01:34:07.181 --> 01:34:09.280
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was this lady,</v>

2303
01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:11.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got scammed for five point $5,000,000</v>

2304
01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:14.830
<v Speaker 3>over the course of a long period of</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

2305
01:34:14.831 --> 01:34:18.430
<v Speaker 3>but it all started out with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he met this lady and a psychic</v>

2306
01:34:18.431 --> 01:34:20.560
<v Speaker 3>bookstore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2307
01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:23.500
<v Speaker 3>she gave him a bit of a reading and</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the reading she found out that</v>

2308
01:34:23.501 --> 01:34:26.890
<v Speaker 3>his dad wasn't well and she said that</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had taken care of her dad through</v>

2309
01:34:26.891 --> 01:34:29.230
<v Speaker 3>hospice and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she had actually done it herself.</v>

2310
01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:33.400
<v Speaker 3>She ended up moving in with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She ended up getting him because she was</v>

2311
01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:34.810
<v Speaker 3>doing readings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>convinced him he,</v>

2312
01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:37.410
<v Speaker 3>she was psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She ended up getting him buying him like</v>

2313
01:34:37.450 --> 01:34:39.920
<v Speaker 3>at $950,000 home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2314
01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:41.170
<v Speaker 3>which will all these investments.</v>

2315
01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:44.290
<v Speaker 3>She ended up taking over all of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>finances.</v>

2316
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:46.240
<v Speaker 3>She moved in with him romantically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2317
01:34:46.241 --> 01:34:47.470
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the weird part,</v>

2318
01:34:47.471 --> 01:34:48.790
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she didn't,</v>

2319
01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:50.860
<v Speaker 3>she was rude in as the caretaker for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2320
01:34:50.890 --> 01:34:52.320
<v Speaker 3>for the father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2321
01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.420
<v Speaker 3>but in the process of all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's getting,</v>

2322
01:34:55.421 --> 01:34:59.120
<v Speaker 3>she's now taking over his finances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's convinced that they're going</v>

2323
01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:00.860
<v Speaker 3>bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got to pay the taxes.</v>

2324
01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:03.080
<v Speaker 3>That tax money is getting funneled</v>
<v Speaker 3>through her,</v>

2325
01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:07.070
<v Speaker 3>gets deeper than this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day he's at the bus station.</v>

2326
01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:10.010
<v Speaker 3>There's this blonde hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful girl with an English accent</v>

2327
01:35:10.011 --> 01:35:15.011
<v Speaker 3>that comes on over and she starts giving</v>
<v Speaker 3>him a reading and he ends up marrying or</v>

2328
01:35:15.801 --> 01:35:17.900
<v Speaker 3>thinks he actually marries us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go at some point.</v>

2329
01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:21.920
<v Speaker 3>Turns out this goal is the daughter of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other woman.</v>

2330
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:25.400
<v Speaker 3>Her name is portia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what did they call their kid?</v>

2331
01:35:25.401 --> 01:35:28.160
<v Speaker 3>They called their kid a Giorgio Armani.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

2332
01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:29.300
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now here's the thing,</v>

2333
01:35:29.301 --> 01:35:30.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a kid together,</v>

2334
01:35:30.930 --> 01:35:35.600
<v Speaker 3>but he thought he had a kid with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns out the kid was a cousin's baby</v>

2335
01:35:35.601 --> 01:35:38.060
<v Speaker 3>that she brought in the House and acted</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she had the baby.</v>

2336
01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2337
01:35:39.641 --> 01:35:41.090
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can look this all up online.</v>

2338
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:42.710
<v Speaker 3>It's all online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like being.</v>

2339
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she used the baby bump thing,</v>

2340
01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:47.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then she acted like she had a second</v>

2341
01:35:47.961 --> 01:35:50.000
<v Speaker 3>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she lost that child and everything</v>

2342
01:35:50.001 --> 01:35:52.310
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only way they got caught is</v>

2343
01:35:52.311 --> 01:35:54.740
<v Speaker 3>because the boyfriend of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the mother,</v>

2344
01:35:54.741 --> 01:35:58.280
<v Speaker 3>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're now in the same day and bought</v>

2345
01:35:58.281 --> 01:36:01.850
<v Speaker 3>these these cars for like a million but</v>
<v Speaker 3>box almost close to that,</v>

2346
01:36:01.851 --> 01:36:03.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he just went out and spent the</v>

2347
01:36:03.111 --> 01:36:05.010
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the US government started coming,</v>

2348
01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:05.571
<v Speaker 3>come in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

2349
01:36:05.571 --> 01:36:06.320
<v Speaker 3>what's going on here?</v>

2350
01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.810
<v Speaker 3>How is this going down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it all came to light up,</v>

2351
01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:09.813
<v Speaker 3>but as.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2352
01:36:09.970 --> 01:36:11.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ralph rains,</v>

2353
01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.760
<v Speaker 3>so I want to believe Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2354
01:36:13.761 --> 01:36:16.670
<v Speaker 3>they just want to believe and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange thing.</v>

2355
01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:19.880
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that that's some sort of.</v>

2356
01:36:19.881 --> 01:36:24.881
<v Speaker 3>There's some sort of an evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect to thought were like to find</v>

2357
01:36:25.461 --> 01:36:30.461
<v Speaker 3>things that are hidden or secrets is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of our thirst for innovation or a</v>

2358
01:36:30.801 --> 01:36:33.430
<v Speaker 3>thirst to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To invent things or to.</v>

2359
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:36.770
<v Speaker 3>To figure out problems more to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2360
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:39.110
<v Speaker 3>to not be deceived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's part of survival,</v>

2361
01:36:39.111 --> 01:36:40.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're always looking for that next</v>

2362
01:36:40.581 --> 01:36:43.430
<v Speaker 3>evolution of what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's gonna work and if we could read</v>

2363
01:36:43.431 --> 01:36:46.160
<v Speaker 3>minds that would help us in our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2364
01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:49.190
<v Speaker 3>It would say it was a lot of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I know that she's really cheating on</v>

2365
01:36:49.191 --> 01:36:51.890
<v Speaker 3>me or she's lying to me or he's lying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me or,</v>

2366
01:36:52.050 --> 01:36:56.990
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just a psychic energy</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like ghosts and all the other</v>

2367
01:36:56.991 --> 01:36:57.770
<v Speaker 3>stuff too.</v>

2368
01:36:57.770 --> 01:36:59.790
<v Speaker 3>It all seems connected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

2369
01:36:59.930 --> 01:37:04.760
<v Speaker 3>it is that almost evolutionary to say I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think we always strive to better</v>

2370
01:37:04.761 --> 01:37:08.690
<v Speaker 3>ourselves and to get that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge and if there's a possibility,</v>

2371
01:37:08.691 --> 01:37:09.920
<v Speaker 3>there's an afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

2372
01:37:09.921 --> 01:37:14.060
<v Speaker 3>what does that really mean for me as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>human being and sort of the evolutionary</v>

2373
01:37:14.061 --> 01:37:17.270
<v Speaker 3>scale now I'm just thinking about things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I do in a very different manner.</v>

2374
01:37:17.271 --> 01:37:19.310
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also like this weird desire that</v>

2375
01:37:19.311 --> 01:37:21.140
<v Speaker 3>people have to know things that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>hidden.</v>

2376
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons why that's the</v>

2377
01:37:24.370 --> 01:37:25.670
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2378
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:26.301
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2379
01:37:26.301 --> 01:37:27.680
<v Speaker 3>that is part of survival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2380
01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:30.290
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what's behind that cave right</v>

2381
01:37:30.291 --> 01:37:30.711
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2382
01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:32.330
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what's over the top of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain.</v>

2383
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:36.260
<v Speaker 3>Are there any animals over there that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>can hunt in that field whatsoever there?</v>

2384
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:38.690
<v Speaker 3>Where's a better place to fish right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>

2385
01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:39.980
<v Speaker 3>Where's the better place to hunt?</v>

2386
01:37:40.190 --> 01:37:43.810
<v Speaker 3>And it's all about survival I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think really on some level it's a</v>

2387
01:37:44.210 --> 01:37:47.690
<v Speaker 3>really screwed up thing that's in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>head pattern that helps us sort of</v>

2388
01:37:47.691 --> 01:37:48.640
<v Speaker 3>survived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2389
01:37:48.650 --> 01:37:51.350
<v Speaker 3>you talk about people wanting to believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2390
01:37:51.650 --> 01:37:52.431
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy,</v>

2391
01:37:52.431 --> 01:37:54.350
<v Speaker 3>there was a Russian psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He Frankel,</v>

2392
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:57.270
<v Speaker 3>I think his name was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now imagine this Joe.</v>

2393
01:37:57.330 --> 01:37:59.070
<v Speaker 3>So you're a conductor on a train,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2394
01:37:59.130 --> 01:38:03.180
<v Speaker 3>And you're going down some tracks with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>train and you see a guy in a white suit</v>

2395
01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:05.490
<v Speaker 3>just looking at the side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking down towards you,</v>

2396
01:38:05.491 --> 01:38:08.070
<v Speaker 3>coming down the tracks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>puts down a briefcase,</v>

2397
01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.070
<v Speaker 3>steps right in front of the train,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stares at the train,</v>

2398
01:38:11.071 --> 01:38:13.320
<v Speaker 3>puts his hand up in sort of a stop</v>
<v Speaker 3>motion,</v>

2399
01:38:13.321 --> 01:38:15.570
<v Speaker 3>but you can't stop car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hit Him and knock him.</v>

2400
01:38:15.571 --> 01:38:17.760
<v Speaker 3>You killed the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in a million pieces of whatever</v>

2401
01:38:17.761 --> 01:38:20.070
<v Speaker 3>happened to him and actual real guy.</v>

2402
01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:23.550
<v Speaker 3>They opened up the briefcase and inside</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a letter says,</v>

2403
01:38:23.551 --> 01:38:26.940
<v Speaker 3>I stopped a bicycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stopped the car,</v>

2404
01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:30.690
<v Speaker 3>I stopped a street car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now I'm going to do the ultimate</v>

2405
01:38:30.691 --> 01:38:31.860
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to stop a train.</v>

2406
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:34.980
<v Speaker 3>This was a psychic who believed he had</v>
<v Speaker 3>powers.</v>

2407
01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:37.680
<v Speaker 3>Now my thinking on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going,</v>

2408
01:38:37.681 --> 01:38:38.311
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going,</v>

2409
01:38:38.311 --> 01:38:40.110
<v Speaker 3>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably stepped in front of a bicycle</v>

2410
01:38:40.111 --> 01:38:42.030
<v Speaker 3>and of course it stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The president put the brakes on,</v>

2411
01:38:42.031 --> 01:38:43.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he stood in front of her car and it also</v>

2412
01:38:43.831 --> 01:38:44.790
<v Speaker 3>stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

2413
01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:48.000
<v Speaker 3>and the street car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got lucky with the train was a</v>

2414
01:38:48.001 --> 01:38:50.490
<v Speaker 3>huge mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say it can't stop in time,</v>

2415
01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:54.390
<v Speaker 3>but this guy really truly believe he had</v>
<v Speaker 3>these abilities and then I get really,</v>

2416
01:38:54.391 --> 01:38:57.060
<v Speaker 3>really cynical and I started thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think about my ex wife and</v>

2417
01:38:57.061 --> 01:38:59.670
<v Speaker 3>stuff and crazy stuff and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2418
01:38:59.730 --> 01:39:01.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe had an ex wife,</v>

2419
01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.180
<v Speaker 3>maybe not an ex wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a wife who said to him,</v>

2420
01:39:03.181 --> 01:39:04.014
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2421
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:06.960
<v Speaker 3>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet you can stop a bicycle,</v>

2422
01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:09.960
<v Speaker 3>hire some guy next door to take a bike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2423
01:39:09.961 --> 01:39:10.920
<v Speaker 3>and stuff like that.</v>

2424
01:39:11.490 --> 01:39:14.370
<v Speaker 3>I bet you can stop a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same Guy in the car,</v>

2425
01:39:14.371 --> 01:39:15.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop slams on the brake.</v>

2426
01:39:15.841 --> 01:39:17.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he happens also to be the street car</v>

2427
01:39:17.701 --> 01:39:18.710
<v Speaker 3>driver as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2428
01:39:18.711 --> 01:39:20.460
<v Speaker 3>so he stops and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She says,</v>

2429
01:39:20.461 --> 01:39:22.470
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really have these powers and you</v>

2430
01:39:22.471 --> 01:39:24.390
<v Speaker 3>should step in front of a train and try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stop.</v>

2431
01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:27.240
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's just me being cynical.</v>

2432
01:39:27.241 --> 01:39:27.960
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2433
01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:29.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a good way to think,</v>

2434
01:39:29.610 --> 01:39:32.940
<v Speaker 3>especially when you've pulled off what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've pulled off and seen what you've</v>

2435
01:39:32.941 --> 01:39:33.774
<v Speaker 3>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2436
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should have a show where you bust</v>

2437
01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:39.420
<v Speaker 3>these mediums.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a show right now.</v>

2438
01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not really.</v>

2439
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:43.110
<v Speaker 3>Here's the intro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you said,</v>

2440
01:39:43.111 --> 01:39:46.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Networks don't want a debunking show.</v>

2441
01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:48.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that kills all their other show.</v>

2442
01:39:48.330 --> 01:39:52.110
<v Speaker 3>We had a show years ago where we came</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and said it was all an illusion,</v>

2443
01:39:52.111 --> 01:39:53.610
<v Speaker 3>but they called it magical miracle.</v>

2444
01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:58.140
<v Speaker 3>And Gallo is on that show and they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>taped blowing out of the water.</v>

2445
01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:00.690
<v Speaker 3>Basically gallows saying stuff that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>denied.</v>

2446
01:40:00.691 --> 01:40:02.580
<v Speaker 3>He said later on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they had the tape of it and they</v>

2447
01:40:02.581 --> 01:40:05.100
<v Speaker 3>could have shown that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they wanted to keep that thing of</v>

2448
01:40:05.130 --> 01:40:07.950
<v Speaker 3>magic or miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was geller a fraud.</v>

2449
01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:12.540
<v Speaker 3>Did girl trick you gotta be careful how</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say this because he loves to sue</v>

2450
01:40:12.541 --> 01:40:13.211
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2451
01:40:13.211 --> 01:40:16.080
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he started to sell people right now</v>

2452
01:40:16.081 --> 01:40:19.260
<v Speaker 3>that he's the world's greatest magician,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's got to be careful with that</v>

2453
01:40:19.261 --> 01:40:22.320
<v Speaker 3>because he sued people who said that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a magician and everything else,</v>

2454
01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:27.450
<v Speaker 3>it is my opinion from everything that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen and the Times that I've</v>

2455
01:40:27.451 --> 01:40:30.450
<v Speaker 3>watched him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he is cheating and he is using</v>

2456
01:40:30.451 --> 01:40:34.260
<v Speaker 3>tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know that I know for a fact he</v>

2457
01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:37.290
<v Speaker 3>uses some of my methods now as well.</v>

2458
01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:42.800
<v Speaker 3>I also know when I was working on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>show phenomenon the first time I told</v>

2459
01:40:43.171 --> 01:40:45.430
<v Speaker 3>this story ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2460
01:40:46.110 --> 01:40:48.380
<v Speaker 3>so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked on a TV show for now</v>

2461
01:40:48.450 --> 01:40:50.100
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was finding the next year he,</v>

2462
01:40:50.101 --> 01:40:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Gallo Criss Angel was on that show as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2463
01:40:51.691 --> 01:40:56.691
<v Speaker 3>And they were the judges on the show and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm geller calls me out of the blue,</v>

2464
01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.950
<v Speaker 3>which was really unexpected because I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>always been on the other side of the</v>

2465
01:40:59.951 --> 01:41:01.390
<v Speaker 3>fence of gala,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2466
01:41:01.410 --> 01:41:03.370
<v Speaker 3>with Randy and the skeptical movement in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2467
01:41:03.970 --> 01:41:06.070
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he calls me up and he says,</v>

2468
01:41:06.071 --> 01:41:07.810
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you doing?</v>

2469
01:41:07.811 --> 01:41:08.561
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing good.</v>

2470
01:41:08.561 --> 01:41:09.394
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2471
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:11.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're known as the guy that creates a</v>

2472
01:41:11.101 --> 01:41:11.741
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2473
01:41:11.741 --> 01:41:14.890
<v Speaker 3>every mentalist working today is getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of your effects that you've</v>

2474
01:41:14.891 --> 01:41:16.240
<v Speaker 3>created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2475
01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:16.931
<v Speaker 3>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2476
01:41:16.931 --> 01:41:20.710
<v Speaker 3>I only have like four or five powers</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've had through the years and if</v>

2477
01:41:20.711 --> 01:41:23.530
<v Speaker 3>anybody could come up with a new psychic</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability for me,</v>

2478
01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:24.400
<v Speaker 3>it would be you.</v>

2479
01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:27.280
<v Speaker 3>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

2480
01:41:27.281 --> 01:41:28.660
<v Speaker 3>How ballsy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2481
01:41:28.930 --> 01:41:32.260
<v Speaker 3>He's calling sort of like one of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>hoping that you're hoping.</v>

2482
01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:35.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's hoping I can create a new trick for</v>

2483
01:41:35.231 --> 01:41:37.660
<v Speaker 3>him that he can tell the world is</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychic.</v>

2484
01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's also must be hoping that you're</v>

2485
01:41:40.031 --> 01:41:41.630
<v Speaker 3>not going to expose them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2486
01:41:41.631 --> 01:41:42.700
<v Speaker 3>this is the great thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2487
01:41:42.701 --> 01:41:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Like even right now when I'm saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2488
01:41:44.381 --> 01:41:46.720
<v Speaker 3>this is when you hang up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2489
01:41:46.721 --> 01:41:47.870
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would he do that?</v>

2490
01:41:47.871 --> 01:41:50.530
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it was just a phone call between me</v>

2491
01:41:50.531 --> 01:41:52.190
<v Speaker 3>and him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows I wasn't expecting it.</v>

2492
01:41:52.191 --> 01:41:55.180
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not recording it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's my word against his word.</v>

2493
01:41:56.110 --> 01:42:01.110
<v Speaker 3>And he can say that I misunderstood that</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he wanted me to need to come up</v>

2494
01:42:01.571 --> 01:42:04.630
<v Speaker 3>with an idea of something for him to use</v>
<v Speaker 3>his psychic power.</v>

2495
01:42:04.631 --> 01:42:06.010
<v Speaker 3>So there's many ways you could spin it.</v>

2496
01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:07.960
<v Speaker 3>When we worked with Chris Angel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris,</v>

2497
01:42:07.961 --> 01:42:09.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on one of his episodes had geller on</v>

2498
01:42:09.971 --> 01:42:14.050
<v Speaker 3>there and Chris put a spoon on the table</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>

2499
01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:14.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you,</v>

2500
01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:16.390
<v Speaker 3>can you bend that and your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2501
01:42:16.391 --> 01:42:17.051
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2502
01:42:17.051 --> 01:42:18.070
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>

2503
01:42:18.071 --> 01:42:18.461
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2504
01:42:18.461 --> 01:42:19.600
<v Speaker 3>my abilities aren't Oregon writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2505
01:42:19.601 --> 01:42:21.280
<v Speaker 3>So if you bent at right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be a trick.</v>

2506
01:42:21.281 --> 01:42:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I can't bend it right now.</v>

2507
01:42:23.890 --> 01:42:24.431
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2508
01:42:24.431 --> 01:42:25.840
<v Speaker 3>if you did bend it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be a trick.</v>

2509
01:42:25.841 --> 01:42:27.730
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Gallo says,</v>

2510
01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:28.181
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2511
01:42:28.181 --> 01:42:29.770
<v Speaker 3>if I bent it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be a trick.</v>

2512
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:31.900
<v Speaker 3>And Christmas I got him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got him,</v>

2513
01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:33.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when he walked away,</v>

2514
01:42:33.701 --> 01:42:34.590
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have him.</v>

2515
01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:35.351
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2516
01:42:35.351 --> 01:42:36.520
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just said it was a trick.</v>

2517
01:42:36.521 --> 01:42:36.851
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2518
01:42:36.851 --> 01:42:37.870
<v Speaker 3>he never said it was a trick.</v>

2519
01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:39.400
<v Speaker 3>He said if he had to do it in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment,</v>

2520
01:42:39.401 --> 01:42:41.800
<v Speaker 3>it would be a trick because it's psychic</v>
<v Speaker 3>abilities weren't working.</v>

2521
01:42:42.010 --> 01:42:43.720
<v Speaker 3>He never says he knows how to do it as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>trick.</v>

2522
01:42:43.721 --> 01:42:45.040
<v Speaker 3>He just said it would have to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>trick.</v>

2523
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walked up together later on,</v>

2524
01:42:47.201 --> 01:42:47.861
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2525
01:42:47.861 --> 01:42:49.120
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use tricks.</v>

2526
01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:49.960
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2527
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:51.190
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2528
01:42:51.250 --> 01:42:51.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2529
01:42:51.850 --> 01:42:53.500
<v Speaker 3>he's collaborative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like very,</v>

2530
01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:56.050
<v Speaker 3>very clever and very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very slick.</v>

2531
01:42:56.051 --> 01:42:56.561
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

2532
01:42:56.561 --> 01:42:58.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's harmed science and took it</v>

2533
01:42:58.871 --> 01:43:02.740
<v Speaker 3>back and it was one of these things I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think why we had to do what we had to do</v>

2534
01:43:02.741 --> 01:43:06.640
<v Speaker 3>at the time because science was going in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this very weird pseudo science</v>

2535
01:43:06.641 --> 01:43:07.451
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2536
01:43:07.451 --> 01:43:09.690
<v Speaker 3>that was back in the days when you had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2537
01:43:10.090 --> 01:43:13.120
<v Speaker 3>old pyramids that would basically put a</v>
<v Speaker 3>razorblade supposedly,</v>

2538
01:43:13.121 --> 01:43:13.750
<v Speaker 3>and it would show up.</v>

2539
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:16.590
<v Speaker 3>And so you got all the pyramids of power</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you had.</v>

2540
01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that stuff.</v>

2541
01:43:18.150 --> 01:43:21.370
<v Speaker 3>That stuff was put things into pyramids</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sharpened them.</v>

2542
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:22.001
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2543
01:43:22.001 --> 01:43:22.811
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't work,</v>

2544
01:43:22.811 --> 01:43:24.940
<v Speaker 3>but it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all pseudoscience,</v>

2545
01:43:24.941 --> 01:43:25.870
<v Speaker 3>but it was all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2546
01:43:25.871 --> 01:43:30.220
<v Speaker 3>people wearing a tinfoil hats and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>written into the whole thing.</v>

2547
01:43:30.221 --> 01:43:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Went on and on and on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a list of just the whole litany</v>

2548
01:43:33.671 --> 01:43:37.120
<v Speaker 3>of whatever happened to pop off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop off.</v>

2549
01:43:37.150 --> 01:43:39.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm just disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2550
01:43:39.311 --> 01:43:41.810
<v Speaker 3>he's back on every night now you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>find him on every night.</v>

2551
01:43:41.811 --> 01:43:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Now the differences this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2552
01:43:43.001 --> 01:43:46.420
<v Speaker 3>So he was one of the first ones to send</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and you've probably seen them.</v>

2553
01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:49.810
<v Speaker 3>He would send out these letters that</v>
<v Speaker 3>look like there were handwritten.</v>

2554
01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 3>It's obvious now we look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know it's</v>

2555
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.940
<v Speaker 2>not handwritten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2556
01:43:52.941 --> 01:43:55.190
<v Speaker 2>that the printed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But back then people weren't aware of</v>

2557
01:43:55.191 --> 01:43:57.380
<v Speaker 2>that and it looks like it's handwritten</v>
<v Speaker 2>and personal to you.</v>

2558
01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:00.520
<v Speaker 2>And I would get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I just signed up when I was at</v>

2559
01:44:00.521 --> 01:44:03.410
<v Speaker 2>were there that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would get an outline of a foot,</v>

2560
01:44:03.650 --> 01:44:06.200
<v Speaker 2>wear this in your shoe and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2561
01:44:06.201 --> 01:44:08.360
<v Speaker 2>wrap it up with $20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$50,</v>

2562
01:44:08.361 --> 01:44:09.590
<v Speaker 2>$100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you put in,</v>

2563
01:44:09.591 --> 01:44:12.140
<v Speaker 2>you'll get tenfold back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2564
01:44:12.141 --> 01:44:14.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get this little piece of water and</v>

2565
01:44:14.001 --> 01:44:17.180
<v Speaker 2>it came from Bethlehem and you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>where that around your neck and then</v>

2566
01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:20.030
<v Speaker 2>wrap it up with money and send that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>send that back.</v>

2567
01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:23.370
<v Speaker 2>So he was making most of his money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at the,</v>

2568
01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:26.570
<v Speaker 2>the events he was making it on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mailings.</v>

2569
01:44:26.571 --> 01:44:28.910
<v Speaker 2>That's where they will making really</v>
<v Speaker 2>making all their money.</v>

2570
01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:32.920
<v Speaker 2>Took a few years for him to disappear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like about three,</v>

2571
01:44:32.930 --> 01:44:34.550
<v Speaker 2>four years to him disappear.</v>

2572
01:44:34.610 --> 01:44:36.980
<v Speaker 2>And after this night show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2573
01:44:36.981 --> 01:44:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he came back,</v>

2574
01:44:39.110 --> 01:44:42.140
<v Speaker 2>but the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now he's not using any of those tricks.</v>

2575
01:44:42.141 --> 01:44:44.570
<v Speaker 2>It's more of a thing that he's on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>air and he's going,</v>

2576
01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:48.480
<v Speaker 2>somebody out there has a headache right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now and I'm going to help kill you.</v>

2577
01:44:48.481 --> 01:44:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Have your migraines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to if you're just on</v>

2578
01:44:50.901 --> 01:44:51.660
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2579
01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:53.000
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2580
01:44:53.001 --> 01:44:55.480
<v Speaker 2>You just say that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a heart attack right now.</v>

2581
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Jesus gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop at Jay's a stump.</v>

2582
01:44:57.171 --> 01:44:59.360
<v Speaker 2>That heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right guys.</v>

2583
01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Guys on the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2584
01:45:00.891 --> 01:45:04.010
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's having heartburn and it goes away.</v>

2585
01:45:04.011 --> 01:45:04.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my Gosh,</v>

2586
01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:06.680
<v Speaker 2>God just failed me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to send them money.</v>

2587
01:45:06.681 --> 01:45:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Liter Pepsi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2588
01:45:08.361 --> 01:45:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2589
01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:10.130
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

2590
01:45:10.190 --> 01:45:12.040
<v Speaker 2>that's what he's doing now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is um,</v>

2591
01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:13.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2592
01:45:13.041 --> 01:45:14.750
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think any of these we should be</v>

2593
01:45:14.751 --> 01:45:16.340
<v Speaker 2>tax exempt or anything like that.</v>

2594
01:45:16.350 --> 01:45:18.560
<v Speaker 2>So that's what's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying.</v>

2595
01:45:18.561 --> 01:45:20.660
<v Speaker 2>Is that they're tax exempt and obviously</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fraud.</v>

2596
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Like how has the government so lax in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

2597
01:45:22.970 --> 01:45:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's even this whole</v>

2598
01:45:25.131 --> 01:45:28.520
<v Speaker 2>thing of like I'm not for profit</v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations,</v>

2599
01:45:28.521 --> 01:45:29.241
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2600
01:45:29.241 --> 01:45:30.074
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2601
01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:33.350
<v Speaker 2>most of them are just fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fakes as far as I think you</v>

2602
01:45:33.351 --> 01:45:37.400
<v Speaker 2>should have to prove that a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage is actually going to the</v>

2603
01:45:37.401 --> 01:45:40.580
<v Speaker 2>cause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with five percent whatever.</v>

2604
01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:42.230
<v Speaker 2>And you can only have x amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>employees.</v>

2605
01:45:42.231 --> 01:45:46.250
<v Speaker 2>The rest of the volunteers and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>employees can get paid a lot of money to</v>

2606
01:45:46.330 --> 01:45:48.780
<v Speaker 2>nonprofit will be certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>poise.</v>

2607
01:45:48.781 --> 01:45:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the president this and this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can only make x amount of dollars</v>

2608
01:45:51.141 --> 01:45:53.450
<v Speaker 2>in a nonprofit or organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't make more than that.</v>

2609
01:45:53.451 --> 01:45:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Or You lose your nonprofit status</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're self sufficient at that</v>

2610
01:45:56.181 --> 01:45:56.590
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

2611
01:45:56.590 --> 01:45:57.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2612
01:45:57.141 --> 01:45:58.430
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you totally.</v>

2613
01:45:58.431 --> 01:46:01.010
<v Speaker 2>It's very disturbing to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2614
01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:04.700
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology sued and won and they became</v>

2615
01:46:04.701 --> 01:46:06.650
<v Speaker 2>nonprofit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they are.</v>

2616
01:46:06.651 --> 01:46:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Or rather they became tax exempt because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2617
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:10.940
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had so much money.</v>

2618
01:46:10.941 --> 01:46:14.240
<v Speaker 2>They had a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every member's money was pulled to be</v>

2619
01:46:14.241 --> 01:46:17.000
<v Speaker 2>able to sue anybody to the point to</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you couldn't win.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating how they did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually fought the irs and one.</v>

2625
01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:30.680

<v Speaker 2>but they got that money from the people</v>

2626
01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:35.180
<v Speaker 2>that they're the congregation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an incredible story really.</v>

2634
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with l Ron Hubbard,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they got video of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2636
01:46:54.690 --> 01:46:56.520
<v Speaker 2>they know the guy in the video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy saying,</v>

2637
01:46:56.521 --> 01:46:58.050
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to make a lot of money,</v>

2638
01:46:58.730 --> 01:46:59.940
<v Speaker 2>start a religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a religion.</v>

2639
01:47:00.450 --> 01:47:02.140
<v Speaker 2>And he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And and yeah,</v>

2640
01:47:02.810 --> 01:47:05.160
<v Speaker 2>when he had the captain's outfit on with</v>
<v Speaker 2>ribbons,</v>

2641
01:47:05.161 --> 01:47:07.740
<v Speaker 2>he gave himself and metals like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

2642
01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:08.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2643
01:47:08.630 --> 01:47:11.130
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the front with this stuff is so</v>

2644
01:47:11.131 --> 01:47:12.540
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so,</v>

2645
01:47:12.570 --> 01:47:16.050
<v Speaker 2>so dangerous in the wrong hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You recognize that it's dangerous</v>

2646
01:47:16.051 --> 01:47:18.500
<v Speaker 2>because you understand how easy people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are to be manipulated,</v>

2647
01:47:18.501 --> 01:47:19.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you've been studying this your</v>

2648
01:47:19.951 --> 01:47:22.040
<v Speaker 2>whole life and you and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2649
01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.940
<v Speaker 2>in a form of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do a show.</v>

2650
01:47:24.150 --> 01:47:29.150
<v Speaker 2>What I really genuinely appreciate is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you and the way penn really go</v>

2651
01:47:29.221 --> 01:47:31.590
<v Speaker 2>out of their way to say that this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>trick.</v>

2652
01:47:31.650 --> 01:47:32.460
<v Speaker 2>This is bullshit.</v>

2653
01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:35.580
<v Speaker 2>We're bullshitting you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not showing you spooky power.</v>

2654
01:47:35.610 --> 01:47:39.450
<v Speaker 2>I got in a lot of trouble for that in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>early days of performing bind reading a</v>

2655
01:47:39.451 --> 01:47:41.430
<v Speaker 2>mentalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moment that I came out and I would</v>

2656
01:47:41.431 --> 01:47:44.790
<v Speaker 2>say to p because to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when you come out and you tell</v>

2657
01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:48.420
<v Speaker 2>people it's not real and you can still</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it and they want to tell you that has</v>

2658
01:47:48.421 --> 01:47:50.910
<v Speaker 2>to be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means something.</v>

2659
01:47:50.911 --> 01:47:51.361
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

2660
01:47:51.361 --> 01:47:53.460
<v Speaker 2>That's impressive to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really impressive.</v>

2661
01:47:53.670 --> 01:47:55.910
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of performers who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not good performance.</v>

2662
01:47:55.911 --> 01:47:59.760
<v Speaker 2>They started out not as good performance</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they need the people to believe in</v>

2663
01:47:59.761 --> 01:48:03.840
<v Speaker 2>them in order to get away with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>trickery and they never lose that.</v>

2664
01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:06.050
<v Speaker 2>They always want people to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tricky one.</v>

2665
01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:08.790
<v Speaker 2>So when I started coming out and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>started saying,</v>

2666
01:48:08.791 --> 01:48:09.780
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's magic.</v>

2667
01:48:09.781 --> 01:48:11.280
<v Speaker 2>It's verbal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nonverbal communication.</v>

2668
01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:13.410
<v Speaker 2>It's all this stuff mixed together to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create a show.</v>

2669
01:48:13.411 --> 01:48:15.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is absolutely nothing psychic</v>

2670
01:48:15.841 --> 01:48:19.140
<v Speaker 2>about what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were quite a few mentalist and the</v>

2671
01:48:19.141 --> 01:48:21.600
<v Speaker 2>mentalism field back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't as many as there are now,</v>

2672
01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:25.620
<v Speaker 2>who were upset with me dunked and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are a psychic man,</v>

2673
01:48:25.621 --> 01:48:28.300
<v Speaker 2>the best way to hide it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say you're not a psychic,</v>

2674
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:29.223
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2675
01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:31.320
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't be true,</v>

2676
01:48:31.321 --> 01:48:33.390
<v Speaker 2>except that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's up with the nails?</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to hold it right in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>

2744

2750
01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.190
<v Speaker 2>don't force it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't force it.</v>

2751
01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:18.320
<v Speaker 2>Just hold it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you feel that?</v>

2752
01:51:18.590 --> 01:51:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a different kind of metal.</v>

2753
01:51:20.450 --> 01:51:21.080
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

2754
01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:21.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

2755
01:51:21.541 --> 01:51:26.150
<v Speaker 2>you're using some sort of fake ass metal</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now it's hard again,</v>

2756
01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:28.250
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're heating it up,</v>

2757
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:29.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

2758
01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:31.490
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to actually get this one to</v>

2759
01:51:31.491 --> 01:51:34.040
<v Speaker 2>break him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm better now.</v>

2760
01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:35.633
<v Speaker 1>Chill.</v>

2761
01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:38.450
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2762
01:51:38.451 --> 01:51:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Because it's some bullshit ass metal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I promise you it's not.</v>

2763
01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:45.560
<v Speaker 2>I have dvds out that teach musicians how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do this.</v>

2764
01:51:45.561 --> 01:51:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Of course you got to be a magician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No where to get it and it uses any fork</v>

2765
01:51:48.621 --> 01:51:49.520
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime.</v>

2766
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Promise you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I got Monday.</v>

2767
01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No bending it</v>

2768
01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:02.450
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they were made out a special metal,</v>

2769
01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:05.240
<v Speaker 2>I would never let you keep them because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be too expensive,</v>

2770
01:52:05.241 --> 01:52:07.670
<v Speaker 2>but this one's gonna twist all the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and that.</v>

2771
01:52:07.690 --> 01:52:11.280
<v Speaker 2>That one's not made a special metal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's regular metal hold.</v>

2772
01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:13.880
<v Speaker 2>I got to concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do use it for real.</v>

2773
01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:16.430
<v Speaker 2>What kind of wizardry is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir?</v>

2774
01:52:17.630 --> 01:52:20.030
<v Speaker 2>He spun this around and turn it into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

2775
01:52:20.630 --> 01:52:22.640
<v Speaker 2>The thing is he's not going to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 2>how he does it.</v>

2776
01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:23.930
<v Speaker 2>That's the real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2777
01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:27.530
<v Speaker 2>you tell me that it's bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you won't tell me how you're doing</v>

2778
01:52:27.531 --> 01:52:31.220
<v Speaker 2>this bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very unfortunate that there's</v>

2779
01:52:31.221 --> 01:52:32.420
<v Speaker 2>different techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing,</v>

2780
01:52:32.450 --> 01:52:33.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2781
01:52:33.230 --> 01:52:35.150
<v Speaker 2>and I really hope you can come see a</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

2782
01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I do things like one person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another person feels it.</v>

2783
01:52:38.570 --> 01:52:40.250
<v Speaker 2>I tell people to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>name a number,</v>

2784
01:52:40.251 --> 01:52:41.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any number at all.</v>

2785
01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>13.</v>

2786
01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:45.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that would be a common number for</v>

2787
01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:46.550
<v Speaker 2>lot of people to choose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2788
01:52:46.610 --> 01:52:48.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are specific words,</v>

2789
01:52:48.231 --> 01:52:49.630
<v Speaker 2>if I said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of a number,</v>

2790
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:52.040
<v Speaker 2>a name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere it was seven letters or less.</v>

2791
01:52:52.041 --> 01:52:52.874
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

2792
01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

2793
01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:54.953
<v Speaker 2>Con.</v>

2794
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people wouldn't.</v>

2795
01:53:00.710 --> 01:53:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Most people that are common words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2796
01:53:02.330 --> 01:53:05.540
<v Speaker 2>that's not a common word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no most people to choose on love</v>

2797
01:53:05.541 --> 01:53:08.540
<v Speaker 2>or have something like that know along</v>
<v Speaker 2>those lines.</v>

2798
01:53:08.541 --> 01:53:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2799
01:53:09.381 --> 01:53:11.540
<v Speaker 2>a dog or cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really common ones.</v>

2800
01:53:11.541 --> 01:53:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2801
01:53:12.621 --> 01:53:14.510
<v Speaker 2>but here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the interesting thing.</v>

2802
01:53:14.511 --> 01:53:15.344
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2803
01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:18.590
<v Speaker 2>So inside this wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you give up on the word because I</v>

2804
01:53:18.850 --> 01:53:20.220
<v Speaker 2>have chosen or there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2805
01:53:20.630 --> 01:53:23.450
<v Speaker 2>yet inside this wallet I put it in car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was driving,</v>

2806
01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:28.030
<v Speaker 2>I was driving earlier on and someone cut</v>
<v Speaker 2>you off and you know what doodling,</v>

2807
01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:30.890
<v Speaker 2>doodling is when you kind of scribbled</v>
<v Speaker 2>without even looking.</v>

2808
01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:33.700
<v Speaker 2>And as you notice inside the hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you open it up.</v>

2809
01:53:33.710 --> 01:53:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Tell me what's on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't want to touch it.</v>

2810
01:53:38.670 --> 01:53:40.910
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to read.</v>

2811
01:53:41.190 --> 01:53:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my handwriting.</v>

2812
01:53:42.321 --> 01:53:44.230
<v Speaker 2>And doodling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a 13 and count.</v>

2813
01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:45.193
<v Speaker 2>It does</v>

2814
01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:49.353
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2815
01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such bad handwriting that I got to</v>

2816
01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:57.570
<v Speaker 2>think that you wrote that underneath the</v>
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>

2817
01:53:57.590 --> 01:53:58.890
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely a 13.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2818
01:53:59.310 --> 01:54:00.360
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah.</v>

2819
01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2820
01:54:02.641 --> 01:54:04.340
<v Speaker 2>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did end up inside the wallet?</v>

2821
01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Because he just shoved it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll try this.</v>

2824
01:54:11.281 --> 01:54:12.590
<v Speaker 2>I can't promise I'm going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2870
01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:42.960

<v Speaker 2>spades.</v>

2871
01:55:43.050 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 2>The two of spades and</v>

2872
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:46.410
<v Speaker 3>I switched from the queen of spades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before you asked that question.</v>

2873
01:55:46.411 --> 01:55:47.870
<v Speaker 3>Higher low.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went low.</v>

2875
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:50.520

<v Speaker 3>Why did you do that?</v>

2876
01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:53.180
<v Speaker 3>Because I thought it was,</v>

01:56:25.831 --> 01:56:29.040
<v Speaker 3>Jordan and stuff like that and he's got</v>
<v Speaker 3>an interesting story about his life and</v>

2895
01:56:29.041 --> 01:56:30.570
<v Speaker 3>it's not that a psychological thing as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2896
01:56:30.571 --> 01:56:34.620
<v Speaker 3>which I'm always fascinated with where</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was performing magic for years,</v>

2897
01:56:34.621 --> 01:56:38.340
<v Speaker 3>constantly performing magic and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't be enacted and the magic was</v>

2898
01:56:38.341 --> 01:56:40.620
<v Speaker 3>kind of a side thing for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it started getting away.</v>

2899
01:56:40.650 --> 01:56:42.900
<v Speaker 3>He'd go on interviews and stuff and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2900
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:46.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't you that guy that does kit shows,</v>

2901
01:56:46.081 --> 01:56:48.300
<v Speaker 3>I want you to do a party for me and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

2902
01:56:48.301 --> 01:56:51.800
<v Speaker 3>And he could never get the part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he started denying that he was a,</v>

2903
01:56:51.810 --> 01:56:55.070
<v Speaker 3>a magician.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just totally left magic completely.</v>

2904
01:56:55.110 --> 01:56:55.501
<v Speaker 3>People say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2905
01:56:55.501 --> 01:56:56.450
<v Speaker 3>I got your business card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2906
01:56:56.451 --> 01:56:57.850
<v Speaker 3>that's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't me.</v>

2907
01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:01.530
<v Speaker 3>That's when he started to be able to act</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he started getting the acting jobs</v>

2908
01:57:01.531 --> 01:57:01.960
<v Speaker 3>and everything.</v>

2909
01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:05.220
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't till years later that he could</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back and be a performer.</v>

2910
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a really interesting story,</v>

2911
01:57:08.101 --> 01:57:10.920
<v Speaker 3>but he does it with magic and teaching</v>
<v Speaker 3>and things and yeah.</v>

2912
01:57:11.070 --> 01:57:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever work with comedy and Magic</v>
<v Speaker 3>Club in Hermosa?</v>

2915
01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:17.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting because he mixes comedy</v>

2916
01:57:17.551 --> 01:57:19.920
<v Speaker 3>and magic together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you'll have like a magician on the</v>

2917
01:57:19.921 --> 01:57:22.610
<v Speaker 3>show with comedian.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that I worked where it was comedy Magic</v>
<v Speaker 3>Club type thing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2923
01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:38.310
<v Speaker 3>so I definitely do teach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't teach one on one.</v>

2924
01:57:38.311 --> 01:57:40.020
<v Speaker 3>I never teach it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't have time to teach one on</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2933
01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:57.690
<v Speaker 3>just the fact that you could spin a</v>
<v Speaker 3>regular fork,</v>

2934
01:57:57.691 --> 01:57:59.460
<v Speaker 3>right this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well fuck.</v>

2935
01:57:59.461 --> 01:58:00.900

<v Speaker 3>There was a way.</v>

2936
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:05.250
<v Speaker 3>It sort of became the holy grail for me</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I can tell you how that came about</v>

2937
01:58:05.251 --> 01:58:07.080
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was muscle walkie Kyoto I told you</v>

2938
01:58:07.081 --> 01:58:09.690
<v Speaker 3>that he could actually put it under a</v>
<v Speaker 3>chair and he would put it in something</v>

2939
01:58:09.691 --> 01:58:13.500
<v Speaker 3>and twists that I was doing an article</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the national enquirer.</v>

2940
01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:15.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think I could do that with</v>
<v Speaker 3>just my hands.</v>

2941
01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:17.430
<v Speaker 3>What's confused?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a guy shows up.</v>

2942
01:58:17.431 --> 01:58:17.941
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2943
01:58:17.941 --> 01:58:19.710
<v Speaker 3>there was a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guy shows up,</v>

2944
01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:22.440
<v Speaker 3>a photographer shows up for me and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

2945
01:58:22.441 --> 01:58:24.310
<v Speaker 3>I want you to bend some silverware so</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2946
01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:25.111

<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2947
01:58:25.111 --> 01:58:25.531
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2948
01:58:25.531 --> 01:58:27.030
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2949
01:58:27.031 --> 01:58:27.960
<v Speaker 3>I go to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2950
01:58:27.961 --> 01:58:28.591
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2951
01:58:28.591 --> 01:58:29.910
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to bend something.</v>

2952
01:58:29.911 --> 01:58:33.000
<v Speaker 3>So I take one and I go like this and</v>
<v Speaker 3>next thing you know,</v>

2953
01:58:33.001 --> 01:58:36.390
<v Speaker 3>it's bending up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I do another band for him.</v>

2954
01:58:36.391 --> 01:58:37.530
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to take a while,</v>

2955
01:58:37.531 --> 01:58:38.670
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2956
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:39.840
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2957
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:40.950
<v Speaker 3>just bend them up with your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2958
01:58:41.050 --> 01:58:41.883
<v Speaker 3>well that's cheating,</v>

2959
01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:43.450
<v Speaker 2>which exactly what I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2960
01:58:43.451 --> 01:58:45.250
<v Speaker 2>so I would say that said to cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he says,</v>

2961
01:58:45.251 --> 01:58:46.840
<v Speaker 2>now go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just start bending them up like</v>

2962
01:58:46.841 --> 01:58:48.220
<v Speaker 2>crazy crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And next thing you know,</v>

2963
01:58:48.221 --> 01:58:51.760
<v Speaker 2>I had a twist and I remember exactly how</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got that twist.</v>

2964
01:58:52.270 --> 01:58:55.780
<v Speaker 2>So I called Randy up on the phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was sort of the holy grail</v>

2965
01:58:55.781 --> 01:58:57.460
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for a way to actually do it.</v>

2966
01:58:57.461 --> 01:58:59.760
<v Speaker 2>And I went in there and have one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those telephones.</v>

2967
01:58:59.761 --> 01:59:00.970
<v Speaker 2>I had the long cord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2968
01:59:00.971 --> 01:59:03.410
<v Speaker 2>all the way to the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I called Randy and I'm whispering</v>

2969
01:59:03.411 --> 01:59:03.971
<v Speaker 2>now and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2970
01:59:03.971 --> 01:59:05.420
<v Speaker 2>I just spent a fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2971
01:59:05.490 --> 01:59:07.300
<v Speaker 2>with my hands and I'll put a twist in</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2972
01:59:07.301 --> 01:59:08.051
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2973
01:59:08.051 --> 01:59:08.990
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2974
01:59:08.991 --> 01:59:09.200
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2975
01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:11.740
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I explained exactly how to do it.</v>

2976
01:59:11.741 --> 01:59:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Now all the mentalist used that</v>
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>

2977
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was a regular fork?</v>

2978
01:59:16.810 --> 01:59:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you twisted that right in front of</v>

2979
01:59:18.491 --> 01:59:19.560
<v Speaker 2>my face with one hand.</v>

2980
01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:22.013
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

2981
01:59:23.230 --> 01:59:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck he did it.</v>

2982
01:59:24.370 --> 01:59:26.500
<v Speaker 2>He not supposed to know he was supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to enjoy the mystery,</v>

2983
01:59:26.501 --> 01:59:27.130
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2984
01:59:27.130 --> 01:59:27.861
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying.</v>

2985
01:59:27.861 --> 01:59:31.090
<v Speaker 2>I know that you can be fooled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very confusing that I could be</v>

2986
01:59:31.091 --> 01:59:33.190
<v Speaker 2>fooled so easily because this is a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>fork.</v>

2987
01:59:33.970 --> 01:59:37.480
<v Speaker 2>I know that there's a certain forks that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make out a shitty metal.</v>

2988
01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:40.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like a nice heat it up and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes like Super Bendy.</v>

2989
01:59:41.650 --> 01:59:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something that's.</v>

2990
01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:45.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get too much into</v>
<v Speaker 2>methods and so forth,</v>

2991
01:59:45.941 --> 01:59:48.310
<v Speaker 2>but that's definitely not something I</v>
<v Speaker 2>use or would use.</v>

2992
01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that looks just a little weird it</v>

2993
01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:53.590
<v Speaker 2>jerking off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm trying to get a dental monic</v>

2994
01:59:53.710 --> 01:59:58.000
<v Speaker 2>ejaculation that may or may not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing about was weird is that how</v>

2995
01:59:58.001 --> 02:00:01.660
<v Speaker 2>easy that fork bent when I bend it when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had it,</v>

2996
02:00:02.230 --> 02:00:05.320
<v Speaker 2>it was very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that bent really easy when I</v>

2997
02:00:05.321 --> 02:00:06.290
<v Speaker 2>bend it and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2998
02:00:06.291 --> 02:00:08.860
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so easy to bend,</v>

2999
02:00:08.890 --> 02:00:09.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would it.</v>

3000
02:00:09.810 --> 02:00:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Why was it so easy to bend now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm can't tell you why at that moment.</v>

3001
02:00:13.230 --> 02:00:14.063
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3002
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:17.930
<v Speaker 2>That if you look now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that fork right there and take a</v>

3003
02:00:17.931 --> 02:00:20.860
<v Speaker 2>look at it and see if it's easy to bend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you'll see that it's not a heat in</v>

3004
02:00:20.861 --> 02:00:21.681
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck her up.</v>

3005
02:00:21.681 --> 02:00:24.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make it easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's because at that moment that's</v>

3006
02:00:24.021 --> 02:00:26.270
<v Speaker 2>the one that I was going to break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to break that one.</v>

3007
02:00:27.020 --> 02:00:30.140
<v Speaker 2>It's very confused and it's a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3008
02:00:30.141 --> 02:00:31.660
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it.</v>

3009
02:00:31.661 --> 02:00:35.690
<v Speaker 2>You'll let people actually touch the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and someone like me who knows</v>

3010
02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:38.780
<v Speaker 2>that you're doing a trick because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>told me that you're doing a trick and</v>

3011
02:00:38.781 --> 02:00:41.390
<v Speaker 2>yet I still can't figure out how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck can you see me work.</v>

3012
02:00:41.391 --> 02:00:43.910
<v Speaker 2>You'll see I throw everything across the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage and a lot of stuff.</v>

3013
02:00:43.911 --> 02:00:46.630
<v Speaker 2>I just leave for people afterwards</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I want them to interact with</v>

3014
02:00:46.631 --> 02:00:48.360
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want them to take them home with.</v>

3015
02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine.</v>

3016
02:00:50.090 --> 02:00:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Especially the forks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3017
02:00:51.770 --> 02:00:53.390
<v Speaker 2>After awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3018
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:56.690
<v Speaker 2>that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just sat.</v>

3019
02:00:57.050 --> 02:00:58.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just sit and look at this fork</v>

3020
02:00:58.551 --> 02:00:59.181
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

3021
02:00:59.181 --> 02:01:01.160
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I could do that.</v>

3022
02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I just gave you a regular</v>

3023
02:01:03.771 --> 02:01:04.321
<v Speaker 2>fork,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jane,</v>

3024
02:01:04.321 --> 02:01:06.020
<v Speaker 2>when you think you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spin that.</v>

3025
02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:08.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I could twist that thing</v>

3026
02:01:08.181 --> 02:01:10.940
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember we were talking about the TV</v>

3027
02:01:10.941 --> 02:01:12.920
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about the TV show</v>

3028
02:01:12.930 --> 02:01:16.730
<v Speaker 2>earlier is I have a pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's out right now for a series which it</v>

3029
02:01:16.731 --> 02:01:19.160
<v Speaker 2>looks like it may be going somewhere so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't wanna say too much about it,</v>

3030
02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:23.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's bringing back the million</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar challenge and it's going out to</v>

3031
02:01:23.001 --> 02:01:25.880
<v Speaker 2>James James,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Randy million dollar challenge and it's</v>

3032
02:01:25.881 --> 02:01:29.030
<v Speaker 2>to go out looking for psychics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>testing them under proper controls.</v>

3033
02:01:29.300 --> 02:01:31.880
<v Speaker 2>If they're trying to trick us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'll expose their methods.</v>

3034
02:01:32.210 --> 02:01:37.210
<v Speaker 2>I will demonstrate my abilities</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposedly to do the exact same thing</v>

3035
02:01:37.611 --> 02:01:41.990
<v Speaker 2>under certain conditions as and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of what makes me the expert to go</v>

3036
02:01:41.991 --> 02:01:44.930
<v Speaker 2>out and try to find these things and see</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's really going on and it's sort of</v>

3037
02:01:44.970 --> 02:01:48.260
<v Speaker 2>a brain games meets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meets the bunking meet psychic</v>

3038
02:01:48.261 --> 02:01:50.060
<v Speaker 2>phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not every single one is going to be</v>

3039
02:01:50.061 --> 02:01:52.310
<v Speaker 2>debunking either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only going to be really debunking</v>

3040
02:01:52.311 --> 02:01:55.610
<v Speaker 2>when somebody is purposefully going out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to bullshit somebody in</v>

3041
02:01:55.611 --> 02:01:57.800
<v Speaker 2>trying to fool people will take</v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage of people.</v>

3042
02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:03.700
<v Speaker 2>It's very baffling stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the stuff about talking to be bold</v>

3043
02:02:04.281 --> 02:02:07.190
<v Speaker 2>and ask them questions and reading their</v>
<v Speaker 2>cues.</v>

3044
02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:10.170
<v Speaker 2>That kind of makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this doesn't make sense at all.</v>

3045
02:02:10.210 --> 02:02:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Fork stuff just does not make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird because the PK stuff</v>

3046
02:02:13.641 --> 02:02:16.160
<v Speaker 2>is something as a mentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a performer,</v>

3047
02:02:16.161 --> 02:02:17.570
<v Speaker 2>you tend to pick your powers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3048
02:02:17.570 --> 02:02:20.780
<v Speaker 2>You tend to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you wouldn't because you're not as</v>

3049
02:02:20.810 --> 02:02:22.880
<v Speaker 2>performance ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we performed this type of stuff,</v>

3050
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.901
<v Speaker 2>we go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3051
02:02:23.901 --> 02:02:26.600
<v Speaker 2>does that fit sort of in the repertoire</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my abilities?</v>

3052
02:02:26.601 --> 02:02:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Do I have x Ray Vision?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3053
02:02:28.011 --> 02:02:30.860
<v Speaker 2>I drive cars blindfolded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know dough in there,</v>

3054
02:02:30.861 --> 02:02:33.320
<v Speaker 2>they put tape over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they see me do something along those</v>

3055
02:02:33.321 --> 02:02:38.270
<v Speaker 2>lines on your show and it's this thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like you pick your abilities and this</v>

3056
02:02:38.271 --> 02:02:42.650
<v Speaker 2>doesn't seem to fit with anything except</v>
<v Speaker 2>that your yellow did do this and also</v>

3057
02:02:42.651 --> 02:02:45.980
<v Speaker 2>said that he could duplicate pictures</v>
<v Speaker 2>and read minds once in a while as well.</v>

3058
02:02:45.981 --> 02:02:47.390
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do too much of the mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading,</v>

3059
02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:49.700
<v Speaker 2>but did a little bit of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody would draw a picture,</v>

3060
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:52.010
<v Speaker 2>then he would draw a picture and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>would match.</v>

3061
02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:54.920
<v Speaker 2>So which is a standard mentalism magic</v>
<v Speaker 2>trick anyway,</v>

3062
02:02:55.070 --> 02:02:56.960
<v Speaker 2>but his method is will a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 2>bold.</v>

3063
02:02:56.960 --> 02:02:58.670
<v Speaker 2>A little bit more direct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

3064
02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still baffled.</v>

3065
02:03:02.330 --> 02:03:05.930
<v Speaker 2>Stopped being baffled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could I not be bent some forks?</v>

3066
02:03:06.170 --> 02:03:07.760
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe someday I'll teach you how to do</v>

3067
02:03:07.761 --> 02:03:10.160
<v Speaker 2>all this and I'll tell everybody know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I want that.</v>

3068
02:03:10.161 --> 02:03:11.520
<v Speaker 2>I want to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't tell them that again.</v>

3069
02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Tell you you can't tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking tell everybody</v>

3070
02:03:16.130 --> 02:03:17.960
<v Speaker 2>then nobody's going to be impressed when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it.</v>

3071
02:03:18.220 --> 02:03:19.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

3072
02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:23.540
<v Speaker 2>I just want everybody to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything else that you could do</v>

3073
02:03:23.541 --> 02:03:24.770
<v Speaker 2>that's fucked up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3074
02:03:24.771 --> 02:03:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really bring a whole lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've kind of just wanted to talk</v>

3075
02:03:27.110 --> 02:03:29.390
<v Speaker 2>more than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3076
02:03:29.391 --> 02:03:30.800
<v Speaker 2>what you've done as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

3077
02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:33.920
<v Speaker 2>very impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I can do one thing for you.</v>

3078
02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:34.873
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3079
02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So see these.</v>

3080
02:03:39.951 --> 02:03:40.784
<v Speaker 2>You know what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3081
02:03:41.150 --> 02:03:43.580
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The zener cards.</v>

3082
02:03:43.610 --> 02:03:47.390
<v Speaker 2>Basically seeing the shapes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically five shapes that were,</v>

3083
02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:51.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were used at Stanford Research</v>

3084
02:03:51.170 --> 02:03:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Institute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Duke University,</v>

3085
02:03:52.251 --> 02:03:54.830
<v Speaker 2>actually not Stanford.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duke University either created by</v>

3086
02:03:54.890 --> 02:03:57.590
<v Speaker 2>causing her a simple shapes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a square,</v>

3087
02:03:57.591 --> 02:03:59.690
<v Speaker 2>there's a star wavy lines plus in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>circle.</v>

3088
02:03:59.930 --> 02:04:01.580
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the standard shapes right</v>

3089
02:04:01.581 --> 02:04:04.550
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to get you to choose a</v>

3090
02:04:04.551 --> 02:04:05.720
<v Speaker 2>specific one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

3091
02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:07.460
<v Speaker 2>psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I asked you to choose one,</v>

3092
02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:09.610
<v Speaker 2>which would you say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3093
02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:12.800
<v Speaker 2>would you even say psychological?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wavy lines that will be</v>

3094
02:04:12.801 --> 02:04:14.540
<v Speaker 2>psychological because it's right in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle.</v>

3095
02:04:14.541 --> 02:04:15.620
<v Speaker 2>And that would be the one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

3096
02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:18.900
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to go with um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3097
02:04:18.901 --> 02:04:21.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go with a star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think star,</v>

3098
02:04:21.050 --> 02:04:22.700
<v Speaker 2>there's a circle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a square.</v>

3099
02:04:23.110 --> 02:04:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plus and the wavy lines are.</v>

3100
02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:26.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to mix them up so you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know which is which.</v>

3101
02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:29.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to look at them in</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a second myself to make sure I know</v>

3102
02:04:29.871 --> 02:04:32.600
<v Speaker 2>exactly where that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

3103
02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:35.210
<v Speaker 2>We can do this as the gambling thing or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

3104
02:04:35.211 --> 02:04:40.211
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd probably rip people off strong.</v>

3105
02:04:40.291 --> 02:04:41.880
<v Speaker 2>I to put that in the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3106
02:04:41.881 --> 02:04:43.620
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is what we're going to do.</v>

3107
02:04:43.710 --> 02:04:45.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take cards and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask you,</v>

3108
02:04:45.151 --> 02:04:49.740
<v Speaker 2>do you think the star is that card you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is not choose a star.</v>

3109
02:04:50.250 --> 02:04:51.051
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Choose a star.</v>

3110
02:04:51.051 --> 02:04:54.480
<v Speaker 2>You won't know why you choose a star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you will choose the star.</v>

3111
02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:55.420
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3112
02:04:55.650 --> 02:04:57.240
<v Speaker 2>you won't have a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just will.</v>

3113
02:04:57.820 --> 02:05:00.300
<v Speaker 2>And it's gonna be something I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something I say or something that it's</v>

3114
02:05:00.301 --> 02:05:03.520
<v Speaker 2>going to be something that I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to make me pick the story.</v>

3115
02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:05.070
<v Speaker 2>This may or may not work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3116
02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:07.620
<v Speaker 2>But snaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pastor,</v>

3117
02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:10.530
<v Speaker 2>do you think this is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think I'm going to say yes,</v>

3118
02:05:10.531 --> 02:05:12.030
<v Speaker 2>that's the star you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3119
02:05:12.031 --> 02:05:13.350
<v Speaker 2>that's a star uses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3120
02:05:13.351 --> 02:05:17.100
<v Speaker 2>So you're supposed to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the star at some point</v>

3121
02:05:17.101 --> 02:05:19.260
<v Speaker 2>because your idea is not to pick the</v>
<v Speaker 2>star.</v>

3122
02:05:19.261 --> 02:05:21.060
<v Speaker 2>I want you to not pick this up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>

3123
02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:24.540
<v Speaker 2>So if you think that's the star right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

3124
02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:26.310
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're just gonna say,</v>

3125
02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:28.170
<v Speaker 2>do you understand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3126
02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:29.053
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here we go.</v>

3127
02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:30.240
<v Speaker 2>I know you're watching me close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

3128
02:05:30.241 --> 02:05:32.050
<v Speaker 2>so let's do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold already.</v>

3129
02:05:32.170 --> 02:05:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Flipped him around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He makes them up one more time.</v>

3130
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:36.840
<v Speaker 2>There's this sneaky hand movements are</v>
<v Speaker 2>so confusing.</v>

3131
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:37.711
<v Speaker 2>Watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3132
02:05:37.711 --> 02:05:38.490
<v Speaker 2>No sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tamar,</v>

3133
02:05:38.490 --> 02:05:40.770
<v Speaker 2>which makes me sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These spent so much time learning how to</v>

3134
02:05:40.771 --> 02:05:45.771
<v Speaker 2>move your hands like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to keep it simple.</v>

3135
02:05:46.030 --> 02:05:48.450
<v Speaker 2>Really simple for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My opinion.</v>

3136
02:05:48.510 --> 02:05:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I've cut it already.</v>

3137
02:05:49.651 --> 02:05:51.430
<v Speaker 2>So because I want to do it again because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make,</v>

3138
02:05:51.490 --> 02:05:52.323
<v Speaker 2>make it very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard.</v>

3139
02:05:52.340 --> 02:05:55.430
<v Speaker 2>If your job is to not choose the star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3140
02:05:55.460 --> 02:05:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Choose a star.</v>

3141
02:05:57.180 --> 02:05:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

3142
02:05:57.960 --> 02:05:59.800
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3143
02:06:00.030 --> 02:06:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'll just ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want this card?</v>

3144
02:06:01.970 --> 02:06:03.510
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

3145
02:06:03.511 --> 02:06:05.220
<v Speaker 2>So you don't want that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't want that one.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Don't choose a star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Watch my hand.</v>

3153
02:06:20.171 --> 02:06:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Don't look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't look and see what you didn't</v>

3154

3155
02:06:24.430 --> 02:06:27.630
<v Speaker 2>She was a plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't choose the wavy lines or the</v>

3156
02:06:27.631 --> 02:06:28.860
<v Speaker 2>square.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He chose a star.</v>

3157
02:06:29.190 --> 02:06:33.510
<v Speaker 2>They look</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of a bitch.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Which sleight of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try.</v>

3164
02:06:42.460 --> 02:06:44.670
<v Speaker 2>I try it one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

3165
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.863
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3166
02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:49.890
<v Speaker 2>To put in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

3167
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:53.670
<v Speaker 2>I hate doing this stuff like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>because especially with the amount of</v>

3168
02:06:53.671 --> 02:06:55.320
<v Speaker 2>people that are listening to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Don't know about wrong.</v>

3170
02:06:58.170 --> 02:06:59.280
<v Speaker 2>If I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked like an idiot.</v>

3171
02:06:59.930 --> 02:07:01.700
<v Speaker 2>If you're raw performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3172
02:07:02.130 --> 02:07:03.900
<v Speaker 2>Somehow or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're not going to be wrong.</v>

3173
02:07:03.930 --> 02:07:05.370
<v Speaker 2>I could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once again,</v>

3174
02:07:05.730 --> 02:07:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try and make you choose a</v>
<v Speaker 2>star.</v>

3175
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your job is to not use it.</v>

3176
02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is the last time.</v>

3178
02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Do you want that card?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3179
02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:19.640
<v Speaker 2>That's the one you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the one I want to keep in mind.</v>

3180
02:07:19.641 --> 02:07:22.160
<v Speaker 2>You did that the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Do you realize that I'm impulsive and</v>

3186
02:07:38.411 --> 02:07:42.070
<v Speaker 2>then I have no patience for the star</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

3187
02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:45.670
<v Speaker 2>He did it the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you thought that by doing it again,</v>

3188
02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:48.580
<v Speaker 2>that I would not think that you would do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it a second time.</v>

3189
02:07:48.650 --> 02:07:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that sort of kind of.</v>

3190

<v Speaker 2>I'm very impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well listen man,</v>
