<v Speaker 2>when did you first burst onto the </v>

8
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:22.741
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilding scene?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What year was that?</v>

9
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it reminiscent today?</v>

10
00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:27.010
<v Speaker 1>First Time I came out here was 1992 </v>
<v Speaker 1>golds gym.</v>

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>So I came from UK to do my first </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional bodybuilding contests was </v>

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.931
<v Speaker 1>called night of champions in New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got second place there and made a </v>

13
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:41.221
<v Speaker 1>real big impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the weeder company that used to be </v>

14
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:43.951
<v Speaker 1>based out here with a flex magazine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle and fitness right down the </v>

15
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:43.951
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to be.</v>

16
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:44.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they are now.</v>

17
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Closed down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a fence around it and </v>

18
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

19
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 2>that's less than a mile away from here.</v>

20
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

21
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 1>the weeder officers are out there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>we though it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a big name and bodybuilding,</v>

23
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:57.170
<v Speaker 1>the magazines and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they flew me out here,</v>

24
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>did my first photo shoot at Gold's gym?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 90.</v>

25
00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 1>So 27</v>

26
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 2>and I remember watching you in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>magazines.</v>

27
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Speaker 2>You were the first guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

28
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:12.401
<v Speaker 2>you know what were the first guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you were one of the first guys that </v>

29
00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:12.401
<v Speaker 2>I ever saw in a magazine that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

30
00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:13.580
<v Speaker 2>gee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck is that a person?</v>

31
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.080
<v Speaker 2>You were so big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man Christ you were big.</v>

32
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Because I look back at some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pitches now me and I say what the fuck,</v>

34
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>

35
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.660
<v Speaker 1>and I came into the sport and I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see what I could do.</v>

36
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I want it to like take it as far as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could take it,</v>

37
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

38
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you represented to me as an outsider </v>

39
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 2>looking in this insane determination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

40
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 2>like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like all the best guys,</v>

41
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Speaker 2>whether it was arnold or you or Lee </v>
<v Speaker 2>Haney,</v>

42
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.860
<v Speaker 2>all the top guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always represented not just like </v>

43
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.630
<v Speaker 2>the biggest and the most profoundly </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously muscular bodybuilders,</v>

44
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.120
<v Speaker 2>but also this extreme dedication that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was required to reach that level.</v>

45
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Been around minute with martial arts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

46
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>And it kind of sport is the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What separates the guy that's first from</v>

47
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.350
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from third or whatever,</v>

48
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all got certain physical </v>

49
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 1>characteristics that help you in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sport and so on.</v>

50
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 1>So you're all gifted up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what can separate the guy from first </v>

51
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.600
<v Speaker 1>and second and third?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

52
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.040
<v Speaker 1>it's all up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

53
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.730
<v Speaker 1>that's the key.</v>

54
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 2>How did you develop your mindset?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it something that you always had or </v>

55
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.520
<v Speaker 2>was it something that you developed as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were training?</v>

56
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.020
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something already </v>
<v Speaker 1>already had and I kind of left home when</v>

57
00:02:32.021 --> 00:02:37.021
<v Speaker 1>I was 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was out on my own on the street </v>

58
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:37.021
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:38.410
<v Speaker 1>you're either going to get smart and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:40.450
<v Speaker 1>look after yourself or you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna fall down.</v>

61
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:43.480
<v Speaker 1>There's nobody there to catch me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was there from a,</v>

62
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>from an early age I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

63
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I was just very determined to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this thing that I will be good at in </v>

64
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.570
<v Speaker 1>order to change my life and change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the projection of my life for the people</v>

66
00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>around me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

67
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.960
<v Speaker 1>I always grew up on a housing estate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK.</v>

68
00:02:58.961 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>I no education,</v>

69
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 3>I was in a jail when I was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had all that.</v>

70
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

71
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 3>the people around me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

72
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:10.981
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want part of that future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to do something else and I got </v>

73
00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 3>this thing that was good at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to take it and run with it,</v>

74
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:17.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy how many people have similar </v>

75
00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:19.801
<v Speaker 3>stories like that where they were in </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a terrible environment and they </v>

76
00:03:19.801 --> 00:03:23.101
<v Speaker 3>realized that they had a tough enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had a smart enough and they had to </v>

77
00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 3>get out of there and if not for those </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible situations,</v>

78
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.070
<v Speaker 3>who knows if they would have ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>reached the levels of greatness that </v>

79
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.070
<v Speaker 3>they can tell you from our point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>

80
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I would have done because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be too comfortable.</v>

81
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 3>If you're comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to put yourself through</v>

82
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 3>that extreme kind of pressure and pain.</v>

83
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

84
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to improve my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed my life and uh,</v>

85
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 3>through the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here I am sitting talking to you on this</v>

86
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are listening to me.</v>

87
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 3>I've been all around the world thanks to</v>
<v Speaker 3>my sport.</v>

88
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 3>So it's been great for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

89
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 3>when you meet current bodybuilders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they like,</v>

90
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

91
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.610
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a gigantic huge Mr Hawkins your </v>

92
00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.610
<v Speaker 3>regular size athletic looking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

93
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe some of the younger guys that are </v>

94
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.100
<v Speaker 3>coming into this now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

95
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.240
<v Speaker 3>people know me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

96
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.850
<v Speaker 3>I was a professional bodybuilder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I did and I was the best at </v>

97
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.571
<v Speaker 3>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that kind of training and that kind </v>

98
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 3>of physique is not going to serve me </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

99
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.150
<v Speaker 3>So I do training to be more functional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My goals are more health related now.</v>

100
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.510
<v Speaker 3>Whereas before I was a young guy and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want it to be the best at this thing I </v>

101
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.510
<v Speaker 3>was doing.</v>

102
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.720
<v Speaker 3>I put everything into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

103
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of physique.</v>

104
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 3>It's not practical for everyday usage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

105
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 3>how to tie my shoelaces when it was 300 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>

106
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

107
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 3>And how tall are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five.</v>

108
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:38.890
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

109
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 3>11,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>

110
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 3>11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like when you were that big,</v>

111
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 3>you were just a ball of muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a mass.</v>

112
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And 300 pounds.</v>

113
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 3>I was 300,</v>
<v Speaker 3>3:10</v>

114
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 3>in the off seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ competing to 65,</v>

115
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:56.700
<v Speaker 3>but I mean to 65.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lean as fuck the hydrated,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shared it.</v>

117
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

118
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 3>that's all I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was all I did.</v>

119
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:04.860
<v Speaker 3>I trained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat asleep.</v>

120
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.220
<v Speaker 3>I studied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just my mental focus was like </v>

121
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 3>lasered on that thing that was doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing else.</v>

122
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.980
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't go to the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't go to dinner if I got home </v>

123
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.980
<v Speaker 3>after 11 because I got to be in a bed at</v>
<v Speaker 3>11.</v>

124
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.530
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the regime that are live for,</v>

125
00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:24.531
<v Speaker 3>for many years and that's why I was able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to beat other people that maybe it could</v>

126
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 3>be argued they were more gifted than me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they weren't willing to do that.</v>

127
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it's all about.</v>

128
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I had always read about you.</v>

129
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:33.850
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

130
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:36.020
<v Speaker 3>there was the impression that I always </v>
<v Speaker 3>got like,</v>

131
00:05:36.021 --> 00:05:39.670
<v Speaker 3>what you represented is the pinnacle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme dedication.</v>

132
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And study,</v>

133
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:42.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

134
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.130
<v Speaker 3>we had no internet then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's got coaches now and </v>

135
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.491
<v Speaker 3>nutritionists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing that appealed to me is this </v>

136
00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:51.880
<v Speaker 3>was an individual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to learn about the training,</v>

137
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 3>had to learn about the nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to learn all this stuff myself.</v>

138
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:56.940
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apart from the training,</v>

139
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.540
<v Speaker 3>that was part of it as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

140
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 3>the learning part of it I enjoyed.</v>

141
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.370
<v Speaker 3>Was it hard to get good information </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm sure there's a bunch of like</v>

142
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.530
<v Speaker 3>gym experts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always these bro science guys </v>

143
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.530
<v Speaker 3>that are hanging around giving you </v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty advice,</v>

144
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.881
<v Speaker 3>like how hard was it to get the proper </v>
<v Speaker 3>information when it came to the </v>

145
00:06:12.881 --> 00:06:14.950
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of sifted through it and uh,</v>

146
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.420
<v Speaker 3>was very influenced by a guy called </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arthur Jones.</v>

147
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:22.421
<v Speaker 3>Don't know if you've heard of him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but off Jones he invented the Nautilus </v>

148
00:06:22.421 --> 00:06:22.421
<v Speaker 3>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

149
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.300
<v Speaker 3>this guy was like a billionaire self </v>
<v Speaker 3>made billionaire who's just was </v>

150
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.630
<v Speaker 3>fascinated with the bodybuilding but had</v>
<v Speaker 3>no business interest in it.</v>

151
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 3>So he just wanted to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He studied it and it was like,</v>

152
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.460
<v Speaker 3>what is it that causes muscle growth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

153
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.580
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he found it was the intensity of </v>

154
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 3>exercise and then there was another </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilder might men,</v>

155
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 3>so went to compete in the Mr Olympia </v>
<v Speaker 3>when the Mr Universe,</v>

156
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 3>he took those principles and who used </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and so I read all this stuff and it</v>

157
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 3>was very logical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made sense.</v>

158
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.140
<v Speaker 3>And then I try to own the gym and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked in the gym and if I trained more </v>

159
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.290
<v Speaker 3>often or if I did more in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my progress was slow down or stop.</v>

160
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 3>As soon as I cut back and I made the </v>
<v Speaker 3>workout shorter and more intense,</v>

161
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.920
<v Speaker 3>my progress went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was for me,</v>

162
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:11.921
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty early on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned how to train properly and </v>

163
00:07:11.921 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 3>that's why I was competing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I competed on a world championship after</v>

164
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:15.620
<v Speaker 3>18 months training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty much unheard of.</v>

165
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 3>That is pretty much unheard of now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you say shorter,</v>

166
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:21.230
<v Speaker 3>more intense workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did you regulate that?</v>

167
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:23.660
<v Speaker 3>Like that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a huge issue with martial artists</v>

168
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 3>is overtraining or they want to do more </v>
<v Speaker 3>work than everybody else.</v>

169
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:30.290
<v Speaker 3>They want to work harder than everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>else and they want a break in their body</v>

170
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 3>down and showing up for the fight.</v>

171
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Overtraining is a big thing.</v>

172
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:39.371
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you see the process for muscle </v>

173
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 3>growth is you go in the gym and it put </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress on the muscle.</v>

174
00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:43.700
<v Speaker 3>If you put stress that is not used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's going to react.</v>

175
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:46.070
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get growth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you need to recover from that first.</v>

176
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 3>You don't go to the gym and grow and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then recover later.</v>

177
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.410
<v Speaker 3>That's the way it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>

178
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.390
<v Speaker 3>if you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

179
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:55.610
<v Speaker 3>you give your body some stresses not </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to,</v>

180
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 3>you'll get a reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but before we get the reaction,</v>

181
00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 3>you have to recover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're not allowing enough time to</v>

182
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 3>recover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just.</v>

183
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.520
<v Speaker 3>I use this analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a seminars I do.</v>

184
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 3>It's very simplistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it gets the point across.</v>

185
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:12.460
<v Speaker 3>If you get a bit of sandpaper and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>rub it across the palm of your hand and </v>

186
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:12.460
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of bloody.</v>

187
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.660
<v Speaker 3>If you leave it and let it heal up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going to happen?</v>

188
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 3>The skin's gonna develop back a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit stronger,</v>

189
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:20.390
<v Speaker 3>a little bit thicker than before because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wants to protect against that stress.</v>

190
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.930
<v Speaker 3>So that's the process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you go and you might get hand </v>

191
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:27.020
<v Speaker 3>bloody and before it's healed up again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going and rub it again.</v>

192
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.450
<v Speaker 3>What's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not really getting any way.</v>

193
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.980
<v Speaker 3>Just going to have a bloody hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

194
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.530
<v Speaker 3>you think you're being tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're actually just being silly.</v>

195
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a why are you going to the gym?</v>

196
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to the gym to get results,</v>

197
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:42.941
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to do whatever it takes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get results and if it means training 30 </v>

198
00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:44.030
<v Speaker 3>minutes once a week or it means training</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 hours a day every day,</v>

199
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:49.330
<v Speaker 3>whatever it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was willing to do it and I would have </v>

200
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.281
<v Speaker 3>done it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm training 10 hours a day is not </v>

201
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:51.590
<v Speaker 3>going to build your muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just going to burn out.</v>

202
00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 3>So I was doing average 40 5:50</v>
<v Speaker 3>minute workouts probably four times</v>

203
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.040
<v Speaker 1>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody say,</v>

204
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:00.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

205
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Whether I write on a piece of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>

206
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

207
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

208
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:10.070
<v Speaker 1>well come and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come and do it and tell me if you want </v>

209
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 1>to do more when we're finished and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody has ever said,</v>

210
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please come and do some more.</v>

211
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:13.920
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

212
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.230
<v Speaker 1>That's enough because every set by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>warmup sets you've got to warm up and,</v>

213
00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:19.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be safe and everything.</v>

214
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.570
<v Speaker 1>But the set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real sets,</v>

215
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:26.571
<v Speaker 1>so I call them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go to absolute failure </v>

216
00:09:26.571 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 1>and even beyond with forced reps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with assistant as reps,</v>

217
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.500
<v Speaker 1>maybe extra negative reps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

218
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that most people neglect when </v>

219
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:35.510
<v Speaker 1>they lift weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>

220
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:35.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've lifted it.</v>

221
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let it go down.</v>

222
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.110
<v Speaker 1>I've lifted it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're neglecting the lowering part</v>

223
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:41.130
<v Speaker 1>of the weight and the negative.</v>

224
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.200
<v Speaker 1>So I get people to really slow that </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

225
00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:48.201
<v Speaker 1>So you're taxing that part as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even at the end of the sit on some </v>

226
00:09:48.201 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 1>exercises with machines where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical.</v>

227
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.380
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't curl anymore physically on the</v>

228
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the contraction,</v>

229
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.710
<v Speaker 1>what your strength on the lowering is </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater.</v>

230
00:09:55.711 --> 00:10:00.711
<v Speaker 1>So if you did curls and you failed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could lift the weight to the top for </v>

231
00:10:00.711 --> 00:10:01.800
<v Speaker 1>you and you could lower it down for </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably another three Reps.</v>

232
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 1>so if you'd just gone to failure here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have exhausted the negative</v>

233
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:08.100
<v Speaker 1>part of the Rep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my thing is the exhaust,</v>

234
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's totally fucked.</v>

235
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.250
<v Speaker 1>You can't live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't lower it,</v>

236
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:16.251
<v Speaker 1>you can't lift it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's total failure if you do that once </v>

237
00:10:16.251 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 1>and an exercise and then time to move on</v>
<v Speaker 1>to another exercise.</v>

238
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.400
<v Speaker 1>How did you develop your protocol?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just trial and error.</v>

239
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Trial and error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

240
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.100
<v Speaker 1>I didn't invent this system of training </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

241
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.420
<v Speaker 1>people there before me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arthur Jones might mentor,</v>

242
00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:32.421
<v Speaker 1>I just taught what they did and refined </v>
<v Speaker 1>it a little bit more for a competitive </v>

243
00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:34.170
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilder because Arthur Jones wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive bodybuilder.</v>

244
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:39.171
<v Speaker 1>People who trained weren't so his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his routines were even briefer than </v>

245
00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:39.360
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for a bodybuilder,</v>

246
00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:39.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got,</v>

247
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.850
<v Speaker 1>you've got to work the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dell,</v>

248
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.350
<v Speaker 1>you've got to work different aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

249
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably did a little bit more than </v>

250
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:48.700
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

251
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:48.700
<v Speaker 1>so I adapted it to myself and my needs</v>

252
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:53.850
<v Speaker 4>now when you were at your height and </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're 265 pounds shredded and </v>

253
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.751
<v Speaker 4>dehydrated and then 310 pounds in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>off season you got,</v>

254
00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.910
<v Speaker 4>it must be like used to looking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself like that.</v>

255
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:05.500
<v Speaker 4>Like was it hard to adapt to being me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You still obviously a very fit guy,</v>

256
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 4>but you're a normal size.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I saw you I'd be like there's a </v>

257
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 4>normal fit guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

258
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.350
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to be in A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not training for bodybuilding </v>

259
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.950
<v Speaker 1>because it's not what I want to do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus I got a lot of injuries from a low </v>

260
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:18.950
<v Speaker 1>super heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did,</v>

261
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:23.631
<v Speaker 1>I got a torn rotator cuff which is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried out a couple of surgeries on </v>

262
00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't repair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

263
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:30.531
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to lift weights and </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to do and what I do because </v>

264
00:11:30.531 --> 00:11:30.531
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm used to doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

265
00:11:30.531 --> 00:11:35.140
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're familiar with doing </v>

266
00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:35.140
<v Speaker 1>something that you're reluctant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change to something else,</v>

267
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.090
<v Speaker 1>but I noticed my shoulder is getting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit worse and my hips were getting,</v>

268
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

269
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.870
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this serving me now?</v>

270
00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Why am I doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I doing this just to try and maintain</v>

271
00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:48.960
<v Speaker 1>something for other people what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think I should look like?</v>

272
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.170
<v Speaker 1>And I kind of came to the conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah you are because you're not,</v>

273
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 1>you're not a bodybuilder in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not competing.</v>

274
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:59.910
<v Speaker 1>So if during this training is not really</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit and humans maybe making your </v>

275
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:01.650
<v Speaker 1>injuries worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:12:01.651 --> 00:12:03.070
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're 60 or something,</v>

277
00:12:03.071 --> 00:12:06.100
<v Speaker 1>you're going to like lift your arms up </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

278
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:09.420
<v Speaker 1>So I'm thinking more practically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

279
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I started doing yoga and I really fell </v>
<v Speaker 1>in love with it.</v>

280
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

281
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

282
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.380
<v Speaker 1>It's physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

283
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I got much more range of motion mobility</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got the spiritual aspect</v>

284
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:26.340
<v Speaker 1>of as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm actually the.</v>

285
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I was inspired to do yoga from a DMT </v>
<v Speaker 1>trip predator,</v>

286
00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:32.770
<v Speaker 1>a dmt trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I came back and I was like,</v>

287
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.350
<v Speaker 1>my body's all fucked up this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

288
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Like I gotta fix some stuff here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What should I do?</v>

289
00:12:38.711 --> 00:12:42.010
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I vaguely knew what yoga was,</v>

290
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:44.900
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't really know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got to do something.</v>

291
00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Got To do yoga or Tai Chee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>

292
00:12:46.751 --> 00:12:50.110
<v Speaker 1>but I started looking into it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>found a yoga teacher.</v>

293
00:12:50.111 --> 00:12:52.840
<v Speaker 1>And I do that a couple times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it's great.</v>

294
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Every time I do it I just think I should</v>
<v Speaker 1>do more on this morning.</v>

295
00:12:55.961 --> 00:12:58.240
<v Speaker 1>And I got up this morning and did yoga </v>
<v Speaker 1>class at 8:00,</v>

296
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Gold's gym and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on an empty stomach,</v>

297
00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:04.570
<v Speaker 1>just had some water and some tea and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking feel amazing or that from that.</v>

298
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

299
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.390
<v Speaker 2>to me it feels like it connects </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

300
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:12.810
<v Speaker 2>It connects all the tissue from the back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the legs to the arms and the neck and</v>

301
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.660
<v Speaker 2>the core.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It strengthens all the connecting stuff.</v>

302
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get a flow going around.</v>

303
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing with bodybuilding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because bodybuilding,</v>

304
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.960
<v Speaker 1>you're isolating the muscles right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're isolating your bicep,</v>

305
00:13:26.961 --> 00:13:31.961
<v Speaker 1>you're isolating the tricep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolating the deltoids and putting </v>

306
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 1>stress on those muscles to maximize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle size of those individual muscles,</v>

307
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.230
<v Speaker 1>which is great for bodybuilding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

308
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.840
<v Speaker 1>your body's function like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

309
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.850
<v Speaker 1>if you throw something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you throw a punch or you know,</v>

310
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't use one muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use the sea,</v>

311
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sits chain affects your whole body,</v>

312
00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:51.730
<v Speaker 1>works together and bodybuilding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really do that,</v>

313
00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:55.090
<v Speaker 1>you don't learn to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I've had to relearn,</v>

314
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.830
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you exercise today,</v>

315
00:13:56.831 --> 00:13:59.050
<v Speaker 1>like what kind of stuff do you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>besides yoga?</v>

316
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.140
<v Speaker 1>I do yoga a do some cycling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in Spain,</v>

317
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:07.170
<v Speaker 1>we've got some good hills there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do because I like to push them and </v>

318
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:07.170
<v Speaker 1>I can't push the whites anymore.</v>

319
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.320
<v Speaker 1>I can't get in that zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

320
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:11.080
<v Speaker 1>because because of my injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got to do something else.</v>

321
00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Yoga is a challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

322
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.940
<v Speaker 1>And it continued to be like if I do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>until I'm dropped down dead 80 years </v>

323
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.570
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always more that I can do.</v>

324
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can always do a bit more range or a </v>

325
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.590
<v Speaker 1>bit more difficult pose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no,</v>

326
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.990
<v Speaker 1>there's no ceiling there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

327
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:30.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the bodybuilding I already been on </v>

328
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:30.320
<v Speaker 1>the ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

329
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:30.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

330
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.840
<v Speaker 1>I do cycling couple of times a week up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and down the hill,</v>

331
00:14:31.841 --> 00:14:33.690
<v Speaker 1>so that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

332
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.670
<v Speaker 1>it's got almost like intervals because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do a hill,</v>

333
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.350
<v Speaker 1>it's intense and then you go flat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit easier.</v>

334
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.110
<v Speaker 1>So I enjoy doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You move to Spain?</v>

335
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I lived in UK and I started </v>

336
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.370
<v Speaker 1>visiting Spain because in Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the south coast of Spain.</v>

337
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:53.580
<v Speaker 1>He's got a very brick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a British community there and the </v>

338
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.180
<v Speaker 1>weather is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like La Mar Bayer is like,</v>

339
00:14:55.550 --> 00:15:00.550
<v Speaker 1>for me it reminds me a lot of la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a mini la without all the bullshit </v>

340
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:03.530
<v Speaker 1>and the traffic about the crime and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>

341
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's why,</v>

342
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.970
<v Speaker 1>that's why I moved there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

343
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.980
<v Speaker 1>that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever looked into anything for </v>

344
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:11.980
<v Speaker 1>your shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like stem cells or things on them?</v>

345
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:11.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

346
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a new surgery now because what</v>

347
00:15:14.241 --> 00:15:19.241
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tore my supraspinatus a couple of </v>

348
00:15:19.241 --> 00:15:21.740
<v Speaker 1>times and because the end was badly </v>
<v Speaker 1>frayed there to chop off the end,</v>

349
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.920
<v Speaker 1>so now it doesn't really bridge the gap </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Humerus,</v>

350
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.220
<v Speaker 1>so it needs a bridge and apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a new surgery that they can,</v>

351
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a bridge now.</v>

352
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I went to see a surgeon and he's </v>

353
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:35.250
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

354
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:35.250
<v Speaker 1>what's three issues here?</v>

355
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have pain.</v>

356
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

357
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really have range of motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually I got more range than the other</v>

358
00:15:40.911 --> 00:15:43.610
<v Speaker 1>shoulder was a bit loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

359
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:49.210
<v Speaker 1>so the only issue with mine is strength </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stability and he wasn't able to give</v>

360
00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:53.030
<v Speaker 1>me 100 percent on whether the surgery </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do that for me.</v>

361
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:58.900
<v Speaker 1>And I've had a bad six surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a tendon reattachment here about </v>

362
00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 1>three on the shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the hips and I'm like,</v>

363
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.820
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're going to tell me a hundred</v>

364
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.820
<v Speaker 1>percent that going through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inconvenience and pain of a surgery is </v>

365
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.360
<v Speaker 1>going to give me what I need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm not going to do it.</v>

366
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to cope with this and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't venture risk,</v>

367
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.260
<v Speaker 1>but so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

368
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:17.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter that much to </v>

369
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.550
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

370
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.811
<v Speaker 1>you do pushups or I can do some pushups </v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably like 10 where before I'd do</v>

371
00:16:20.991 --> 00:16:24.680
<v Speaker 1>like 100 or something so it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>weakened in stable.</v>

372
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.570
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if.</v>

373
00:16:25.571 --> 00:16:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

374
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.890
<v Speaker 1>if I had a surgeon that says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

375
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:33.130
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do this and I guarantee </v>
<v Speaker 1>your shoulders going to be stronger and </v>

376
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.951
<v Speaker 1>more stable after it because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to sit with you in a sling </v>

377
00:16:35.951 --> 00:16:37.170
<v Speaker 1>for like six to eight weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't shower properly,</v>

378
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:41.030
<v Speaker 1>can't dress and in and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me to go through that again,</v>

379
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I would have to have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

380
00:16:42.741 --> 00:16:45.960
<v Speaker 1>this is definitely going to help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I would consider it until then I'll</v>

381
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:46.910
<v Speaker 1>live with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

382
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.670
<v Speaker 1>they're doing some pretty amazing stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>now with stem cells.</v>

383
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there with some tendon tissue.</v>

384
00:16:52.461 --> 00:16:52.790
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

385
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:58.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can do a lot of soft tissue </v>

386
00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:58.060
<v Speaker 2>regeneration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're also doing it now.</v>

387
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.691
<v Speaker 2>The most recent things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're combining stem cells with </v>

388
00:17:01.691 --> 00:17:04.210
<v Speaker 2>platelet rich plasma that doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and they found that by doing </v>

389
00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:08.351
<v Speaker 2>the stem cells in the prp together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helps generate new tissue growth </v>

390
00:17:08.351 --> 00:17:08.351
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

391
00:17:08.351 --> 00:17:08.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

392
00:17:08.351 --> 00:17:13.030
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had a knee surgery and she had the </v>

393
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:13.030
<v Speaker 1>PRP and the recovery was real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

394
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.240
<v Speaker 1>it's nice it she had meniscus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what it was?</v>

395
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

396
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:19.820
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's any surgeons out there that </v>

397
00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 1>repair Dorian's shortened supraspinatus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me know,</v>

398
00:17:21.231 --> 00:17:21.410
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

399
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Now is your situation very similar to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what a lot of bodybuilders face after </v>

400
00:17:27.491 --> 00:17:28.420
<v Speaker 2>they retire?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

401
00:17:28.421 --> 00:17:32.110
<v Speaker 2>they're so much stress and strain on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>joints in the back and.</v>

402
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm Ronnie Coleman,</v>

403
00:17:34.211 --> 00:17:39.211
<v Speaker 1>who is the Mr Olympia after me and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said be serious.</v>

404
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.860
<v Speaker 1>He did a lot of really heavy squatting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also when he was getting ready for</v>

405
00:17:44.861 --> 00:17:46.990
<v Speaker 1>a bodybuilding competition and basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing power lifting,</v>

406
00:17:46.991 --> 00:17:49.960
<v Speaker 1>which probably not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

407
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.100
<v Speaker 3>so ron has a lot of problems with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>discs in his back and I'm not sure of </v>

408
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 3>all the details,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know he's had a lot of fusions.</v>

409
00:17:57.121 --> 00:18:00.100
<v Speaker 3>So his mobility and so on is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>limited.</v>

410
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.220
<v Speaker 3>And one fusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

411
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:07.040
<v Speaker 3>several.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he can't turn his neck and his back </v>

412
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:07.230
<v Speaker 3>to good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is that both of his hips replaced?</v>

413
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

414
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.510
<v Speaker 3>He's a young guy to hold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was Ronnie's?</v>

415
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.800
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no run is like almost my age is probably</v>

416
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:14.930
<v Speaker 3>early fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

417
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.340
<v Speaker 3>Why do I think he's younger than that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He retired.</v>

418
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking should I said 4,636?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>

419
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:25.560
<v Speaker 3>We both were known to be very strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>running more so than myself because they</v>

420
00:18:25.561 --> 00:18:29.340
<v Speaker 3>did power lifting before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we moved some heavy weights and uh,</v>

421
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:34.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any sport man is that you're going to </v>

422
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.430
<v Speaker 3>have some consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

423
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.530
<v Speaker 3>No To ron if you fight and play </v>
<v Speaker 3>football,</v>

424
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.300
<v Speaker 3>whatever and everything has its,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

425
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:39.690
<v Speaker 3>its downside.</v>

426
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.310
<v Speaker 3>But all things considering I think I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing pretty good.</v>

427
00:18:44.311 --> 00:18:46.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm healthy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a dicky shoulder.</v>

428
00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:48.900
<v Speaker 3>So big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

429
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you man,</v>

430
00:18:50.371 --> 00:18:55.371
<v Speaker 3>if you just hang in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're on their way to figuring </v>

431
00:18:55.371 --> 00:18:55.371
<v Speaker 3>something out for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

432
00:18:55.371 --> 00:18:55.371
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's almost what I'm thinking.</v>

433
00:18:55.371 --> 00:18:59.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking like don't do anything now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because a few years time there'll be </v>

434
00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:00.980
<v Speaker 3>something that can really do the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

435
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.450
<v Speaker 3>I'll wait until then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

436
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:03.990
<v Speaker 3>The last thing you want to do is get </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

437
00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:08.991
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always tell that to my friends that </v>

438
00:19:08.991 --> 00:19:08.991
<v Speaker 3>are thinking about getting disks fused </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>

439
00:19:08.991 --> 00:19:09.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so close.</v>

440
00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:14.370
<v Speaker 3>They're shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're shooting stem cells into the </v>

441
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.511
<v Speaker 3>discs directly in regenerating tissue </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same way they've been regenerating </v>

442
00:19:17.511 --> 00:19:21.530
<v Speaker 3>municipals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tissue and tendon tissue and things </v>

443
00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.291
<v Speaker 3>along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met a guy that trained out here many </v>

444
00:19:24.291 --> 00:19:27.410
<v Speaker 3>years ago in La and he told me they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>an I've seen before and after x rays of </v>

445
00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:30.600
<v Speaker 3>joints that are the joints destroyed.</v>

446
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.600
<v Speaker 3>He's got no cartilage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so looking at replacement and these guys</v>

447
00:19:33.601 --> 00:19:35.490
<v Speaker 3>have actually regenerated the tissue </v>
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

448
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.670
<v Speaker 3>but it's quite a lengthy process of </v>
<v Speaker 3>traction,</v>

449
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:43.730
<v Speaker 3>like hanging upside down and hours of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultrasound just to push a ton of blood </v>

450
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.841
<v Speaker 3>into that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blood Supply and then you can heal it </v>

451
00:19:47.841 --> 00:19:50.271
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can actually regrow cartilage </v>

452
00:19:50.271 --> 00:19:50.271
<v Speaker 3>tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>

453
00:19:50.271 --> 00:19:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not quick.</v>

454
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.880
<v Speaker 3>It's not on the protocol of the Medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>Association.</v>

455
00:19:53.881 --> 00:19:56.730
<v Speaker 3>So they basically push these guys out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>business with lawsuits.</v>

456
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

457
00:19:57.331 --> 00:20:02.331
<v Speaker 3>there's a doctor that we've talked about</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the podcast before that recommends </v>

458
00:20:02.331 --> 00:20:05.901
<v Speaker 3>hanging from a bars for your shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the best things ever to </v>

459
00:20:05.901 --> 00:20:10.080
<v Speaker 3>alleviate pain and also to increase </v>
<v Speaker 3>range of motion and reduce impingements.</v>

460
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have to get in touch with this guy.</v>

461
00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well just for my,</v>

462
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:19.180
<v Speaker 3>for my back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got the inversion table and I do that </v>

463
00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:19.290
<v Speaker 3>a couple of times a week just to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>them ability there.</v>

464
00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:21.600
<v Speaker 3>I know one of my discs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>l five five's a little bit warm,</v>

465
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.690
<v Speaker 3>but I don't do squats or heavy overhead </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

466
00:20:24.691 --> 00:20:27.010
<v Speaker 3>so I think it's going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

467
00:20:27.011 --> 00:20:28.230
<v Speaker 3>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

468
00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:33.820
<v Speaker 3>it's all about prevention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard of the reverse hyper </v>

469
00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:33.820
<v Speaker 3>machine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that?</v>

470
00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:33.820
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

471
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.460
<v Speaker 3>We have one in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll show it to you,</v>

472
00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:38.910
<v Speaker 3>but it's a creation of a west side </v>
<v Speaker 3>barbell.</v>

473
00:20:38.911 --> 00:20:41.160
<v Speaker 3>You know Louie Simmons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy bastard.</v>

474
00:20:41.161 --> 00:20:46.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Louie Simmons created this machine that </v>

475
00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:48.020
<v Speaker 3>when you lift your legs up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it strengthens back and on the</v>

476
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:49.540
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it swings down,</v>

477
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:53.560
<v Speaker 4>it's active decompression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>phenomenal for disc issues.</v>

478
00:20:53.561 --> 00:20:56.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like active decompression plus </v>
<v Speaker 4>strengthening together.</v>

479
00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.360
<v Speaker 4>I have one back here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it so much.</v>

480
00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.940
<v Speaker 4>Right there is like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could see it up here.</v>

481
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:06.380
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've talked about this so many times </v>

482
00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:06.640
<v Speaker 4>people would think this guy is like </v>
<v Speaker 4>hired me to endorse this product,</v>

483
00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 4>but it's an amazing product.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is.</v>

484
00:21:08.921 --> 00:21:13.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the reverse of the hyperextension </v>

485
00:21:13.921 --> 00:21:13.921
<v Speaker 4>la,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he can explain it.</v>

486
00:21:13.921 --> 00:21:15.150
<v Speaker 5>Can hear the range of motion at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Squeeze,</v>

487
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.080
<v Speaker 5>squeeze,</v>
<v Speaker 5>squeeze.</v>

488
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.910
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She drops her head.</v>

489
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.710
<v Speaker 5>Raise your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Way Up.</v>

490
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.870
<v Speaker 5>Drops on the way down for a flagship in </v>
<v Speaker 5>extension is fine.</v>

491
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:31.100
<v Speaker 5>This will absolutely help desk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is traction.</v>

492
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.100
<v Speaker 5>Motion Traction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and got one of those</v>

493
00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.320
<v Speaker 4>wife very fit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm sure she does a lot of lifting as</v>

494
00:21:41.321 --> 00:21:44.830
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was a world champion as well.</v>

495
00:21:44.831 --> 00:21:45.640
<v Speaker 4>Enough failed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

496
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.760
<v Speaker 4>it's so common for anybody that puts any</v>
<v Speaker 4>strain in their body to have usually </v>

497
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.000
<v Speaker 4>five l and l,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four area on the.</v>

498
00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:56.050
<v Speaker 4>On the bottom of the spine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things about bodybuilding is </v>

499
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:56.800
<v Speaker 4>that in isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're,</v>

500
00:21:56.801 --> 00:21:58.660
<v Speaker 4>you're constantly isolating these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

501
00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:03.250
<v Speaker 4>does that run the risk of like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>weakening certain areas?</v>

502
00:22:03.251 --> 00:22:08.251
<v Speaker 4>Like you have to be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine very cognizant about </v>

503
00:22:08.251 --> 00:22:08.251
<v Speaker 4>balancing everything out.</v>

504
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

505
00:22:09.821 --> 00:22:12.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with bodybuilders,</v>

506
00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:17.041
<v Speaker 1>a shoulder injuries is the most common </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've got the rotator cuff </v>

507
00:22:17.041 --> 00:22:18.580
<v Speaker 1>which is a small muscles and tendons </v>
<v Speaker 1>which gives you the ability.</v>

508
00:22:18.581 --> 00:22:20.590
<v Speaker 1>That's why it can move it around rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than being a hinge.</v>

509
00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happens,</v>

510
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get an strongly at altschool,</v>

511
00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.130
<v Speaker 1>all these external muscles are getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and stronger,</v>

512
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:32.490
<v Speaker 1>but these guys inside I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So eventually they get overloaded and </v>

513
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:33.490
<v Speaker 1>you get some kind of issue there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of tear.</v>

514
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:39.530
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm training people now I give </v>
<v Speaker 1>them a rotation exercises to strengthen </v>

515
00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.590
<v Speaker 1>those areas so that can avoid that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Hey man,</v>

516
00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I started training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The eight is like we didn't know </v>

517
00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.640
<v Speaker 1>anything and when I got an injury and </v>
<v Speaker 1>are living in England as well,</v>

518
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:53.680
<v Speaker 1>there's no sports medicine doctors </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with strength athletes or so on.</v>

519
00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:55.410
<v Speaker 1>And so I just go to your doctor and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

520
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.730
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lifting weights,</v>

521
00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.720
<v Speaker 1>stopped doing that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you left their wives,</v>

522
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.610
<v Speaker 1>take these pills and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

523
00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we have much more information,</v>

524
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.140
<v Speaker 1>much more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

525
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:13.460
<v Speaker 1>a sports therapist and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot more things available </v>

526
00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.341
<v Speaker 1>now and a lot more knowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that we didn't really have </v>

527
00:23:17.341 --> 00:23:17.341
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

528
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:18.610
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the main thing,</v>

529
00:23:18.611 --> 00:23:23.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>collect some of the smallest supporting </v>

530
00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:26.941
<v Speaker 1>muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you're doing major </v>

531
00:23:26.941 --> 00:23:26.941
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding exercises,</v>

532
00:23:26.941 --> 00:23:30.580
<v Speaker 4>do guys now address that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they do like a lot of rotation </v>

533
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:30.930
<v Speaker 4>exercises?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of rotation</v>

534
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.740
<v Speaker 1>in the gym than like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

535
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.940
<v Speaker 1>if it did that back in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like what the fuck you're doing </v>

536
00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.130
<v Speaker 1>little wait time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lift some weights.</v>

537
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.130
<v Speaker 1>But I see people doing it now and with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bands and everything.</v>

538
00:23:42.131 --> 00:23:45.220
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people doing more preventative stuff.</v>

539
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating</v>

540
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:51.190
<v Speaker 2>because there was guys like arnold who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was kind of the original pioneers and </v>

541
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.720
<v Speaker 2>then guys like you who came after him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you were still again,</v>

542
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.540
<v Speaker 2>pre-internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring things out on your own,</v>

543
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:58.340
<v Speaker 2>learning from the guys that came before </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

544
00:23:58.341 --> 00:23:59.870
<v Speaker 2>but taking it to another level,</v>

545
00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:03.990
<v Speaker 3>that was the beauty of it for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never really liked team sports because</v>

546
00:24:03.991 --> 00:24:06.390
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like this I sold was letting</v>
<v Speaker 3>me down here,</v>

547
00:24:06.391 --> 00:24:11.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I felt like that through my life as </v>

548
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:11.391
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like,</v>

549
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:12.600
<v Speaker 3>like my parents didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

550
00:24:12.601 --> 00:24:14.430
<v Speaker 3>like everyone's fucking letting me down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck this,</v>

551
00:24:14.431 --> 00:24:19.431
<v Speaker 3>I'll do this myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I got to learn about the </v>

552
00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:19.431
<v Speaker 3>nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned about the training,</v>

553
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:24.440
<v Speaker 3>I got to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to pull it all into action and </v>

554
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.321
<v Speaker 3>of course I had people supporting me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I got on that stage it was win </v>

555
00:24:27.451 --> 00:24:32.451
<v Speaker 3>or lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking full responsibility for this </v>

556
00:24:32.451 --> 00:24:36.260
<v Speaker 3>and we don't really have that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guys don't learn anything </v>

557
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.020
<v Speaker 3>because they've got coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what should I do?</v>

558
00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.750
<v Speaker 3>Bus Do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that and eat this and eat that.</v>

559
00:24:39.751 --> 00:24:41.850
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

560
00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.640
<v Speaker 3>the beauty of it's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not learning anything anymore.</v>

561
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.360
<v Speaker 3>What if you fall out with the coach like</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to do next contest.</v>

562
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.290
<v Speaker 3>So is that like a big thing now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's like a series of coaches,</v>

563
00:24:52.291 --> 00:24:55.410
<v Speaker 3>is it like MMA camps?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing and it's like,</v>

564
00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the guys a suckers because who </v>

565
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:02.040
<v Speaker 3>is making the money here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The coaches,</v>

566
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.380
<v Speaker 3>the coaches are making the money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the,</v>

567
00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:09.410
<v Speaker 3>not the competitors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The coaches are smart and I look at the </v>

568
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.781
<v Speaker 3>coaches and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck are you and what have you </v>

569
00:25:11.781 --> 00:25:11.781
<v Speaker 3>done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

570
00:25:11.781 --> 00:25:12.720
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which contest if you actually want.</v>

571
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.410
<v Speaker 3>And most of them haven't done anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just all theory.</v>

572
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.060
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sort of the exercise </v>
<v Speaker 3>physiologists,</v>

573
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:25.120
<v Speaker 3>just guys from the industry that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

574
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.860
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've trained a few people and they've</v>

575
00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:30.390
<v Speaker 3>got a few results and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more about the,</v>

576
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:34.080
<v Speaker 3>for me it's more about the insecurity of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys competing.</v>

577
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.260
<v Speaker 3>Like why don't you learn yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to your body.</v>

578
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.510
<v Speaker 3>And I used to make notes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

579
00:25:39.511 --> 00:25:43.080
<v Speaker 3>every week I'd write down my diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd write down every single workout that</v>

580
00:25:43.081 --> 00:25:47.550
<v Speaker 3>I ever did from 1984 to 1997.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have in a training log.</v>

581
00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:52.910
<v Speaker 3>You should sell that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I printed out all these little exercise </v>

582
00:25:53.341 --> 00:25:53.880
<v Speaker 3>books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

583
00:25:53.881 --> 00:25:57.090
<v Speaker 3>and like you can see the first one went </v>
<v Speaker 3>on like 21 years old.</v>

584
00:25:57.091 --> 00:25:59.400
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit childish with the comments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it's like,</v>

585
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt shit today.</v>

586
00:26:00.451 --> 00:26:03.240
<v Speaker 3>This was a shitty worker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never fucking let this happen again,</v>

587
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:04.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff.</v>

588
00:26:04.321 --> 00:26:09.321
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've got all this and then go back </v>

589
00:26:09.321 --> 00:26:12.201
<v Speaker 3>and look at it sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's weird because I can go back to </v>

590
00:26:12.201 --> 00:26:16.380
<v Speaker 3>1988 and I can look in my book and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that workout and I was like,</v>

591
00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:21.390
<v Speaker 3>I was in this gym and I was training </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this guy and I can't even remember.</v>

592
00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.760
<v Speaker 3>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do I was wearing.</v>

593
00:26:23.761 --> 00:26:26.970
<v Speaker 3>And I can go back in time and remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>just from those nodes.</v>

594
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like every workout.</v>

595
00:26:28.411 --> 00:26:30.060
<v Speaker 3>As soon as I've got home and I finished,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

596
00:26:30.061 --> 00:26:30.750
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bench press,</v>

597
00:26:30.751 --> 00:26:35.751
<v Speaker 3>I did this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and every month I would make notes and </v>

598
00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:35.751
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

599
00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:39.830
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are my goals for the next four </v>

600
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.830
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

601
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:40.410
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like little goals,</v>

602
00:26:40.411 --> 00:26:42.540
<v Speaker 3>like I'm going to put five pounds on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>bench press,</v>

603
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:44.880
<v Speaker 3>but you do that every month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the end of the month,</v>

604
00:26:44.881 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 3>you've got your end of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got 60 pounds,</v>

605
00:26:46.921 --> 00:26:47.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

606
00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did all these things like,</v>

607
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mental rehearsal,</v>

608
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.160
<v Speaker 3>visualization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff.</v>

609
00:26:56.161 --> 00:26:56.930
<v Speaker 3>I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

610
00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I kind of learned it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody,</v>

611
00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.700
<v Speaker 3>nobody taught me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

612
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the things,</v>

613
00:27:01.231 --> 00:27:06.231
<v Speaker 3>goal setting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing and writing it down on a piece </v>

614
00:27:06.231 --> 00:27:06.231
<v Speaker 3>of paper just.</v>

615
00:27:06.231 --> 00:27:07.230
<v Speaker 3>And that you can do this with anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your business,</v>

616
00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:12.231
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're writing it down on a piece of </v>

617
00:27:12.231 --> 00:27:12.231
<v Speaker 3>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make a commitment,</v>

618
00:27:12.231 --> 00:27:12.231
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're on a piece of paper everyday.</v>

619
00:27:12.231 --> 00:27:16.080
<v Speaker 3>You can look at that and it just gives </v>
<v Speaker 3>you a stronger mental vision.</v>

620
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.910
<v Speaker 3>And instead of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

621
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to win this contest in 18 </v>
<v Speaker 3>months time.</v>

622
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:26.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's cool you're going to win that </v>

623
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:26.180
<v Speaker 3>contest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how are you going to get the.</v>

624
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like saying I'm going to sail to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>

625
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:27.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a good idea.</v>

626
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:29.310
<v Speaker 3>That's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how are you going to get there?</v>

627
00:27:29.311 --> 00:27:31.020
<v Speaker 3>If you've got a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you've got a map of like,</v>

628
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.400
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go with no map,</v>

629
00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:33.570
<v Speaker 3>you're just going to get lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

630
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.440
<v Speaker 3>So I found that very helpful and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I try to teach people as well,</v>

631
00:27:37.441 --> 00:27:38.060
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

632
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:43.070
<v Speaker 3>I think writing down goals is huge and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something that most people don't </v>

633
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.070
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

634
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.680
<v Speaker 3>I still do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a daily thing.</v>

635
00:27:43.681 --> 00:27:46.440
<v Speaker 3>This is what I got to do today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I won't get through it all,</v>

636
00:27:46.441 --> 00:27:47.850
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least it's there.</v>

637
00:27:47.851 --> 00:27:49.530
<v Speaker 3>I might put a couple of things off for </v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow,</v>

638
00:27:49.531 --> 00:27:51.660
<v Speaker 3>but I find it very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very helpful.</v>

639
00:27:51.661 --> 00:27:52.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

640
00:27:52.231 --> 00:27:54.690
<v Speaker 3>And which I've written it down like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

641
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.640
<v Speaker 3>like let's say a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

642
00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.520
<v Speaker 3>you want to stop drinking or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write it down.</v>

643
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:04.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to stop drinking alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sign it if I can put it there on your </v>

644
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:06.380
<v Speaker 3>table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It don't just have said that you've said</v>

645
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.160
<v Speaker 3>that you've made the commitment to put </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a paper,</v>

646
00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:11.310
<v Speaker 3>so you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna let yourself down.</v>

647
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.080
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be a pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be weak and you're going</v>

648
00:28:13.081 --> 00:28:13.590
<v Speaker 3>to break that.</v>

649
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:14.940
<v Speaker 3>You made that commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

650
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's there on a piece of paper.</v>

651
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:17.560
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

652
00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:22.890
<v Speaker 3>that's that strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially for the type of person like </v>

653
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.671
<v Speaker 3>you dedicated focused guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like something like that is just extra </v>

654
00:28:25.671 --> 00:28:25.671
<v Speaker 3>motivation in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

655
00:28:25.671 --> 00:28:26.300
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

656
00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.500
<v Speaker 3>it's a scaffolding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

657
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:29.550
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there,</v>

658
00:28:29.551 --> 00:28:30.300
<v Speaker 3>it's solid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

659
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.220
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just say it casually.</v>

660
00:28:32.221 --> 00:28:34.410
<v Speaker 3>I fucking committed to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote it down,</v>

661
00:28:34.411 --> 00:28:35.070
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

662
00:28:35.071 --> 00:28:36.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm a firm believer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you should,</v>

663
00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.200
<v Speaker 3>at least for a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

664
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:43.220
<v Speaker 3>at least for your week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>set it down and have a little checkbox </v>

665
00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:43.860
<v Speaker 3>next to it and make sure you can look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

666
00:28:43.861 --> 00:28:44.640
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this,</v>

667
00:28:44.641 --> 00:28:46.230
<v Speaker 3>I got my workout in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got my,</v>

668
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.310
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

669
00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Whatever you need to get done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you trying to slack off.</v>

670
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.050
<v Speaker 3>It's five things to do that I did for </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

671
00:28:52.051 --> 00:28:56.640
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do the fifth one because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoked a joint with four to five.</v>

672
00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.190
<v Speaker 3>Still that four out of five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would reward myself.</v>

673
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.380
<v Speaker 3>If you do write things down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

674
00:29:01.381 --> 00:29:06.381
<v Speaker 3>you'll just get more done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you don't fulfill the entire </v>

675
00:29:06.381 --> 00:29:08.850
<v Speaker 3>even to get more done than than if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't do it 100 percent.</v>

676
00:29:08.851 --> 00:29:10.680
<v Speaker 3>It's having a plan man and everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs a plan.</v>

677
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:12.570
<v Speaker 3>If you want to get somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll use that analogy.</v>

678
00:29:12.571 --> 00:29:15.240
<v Speaker 3>If you want to get somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a captain on a ship,</v>

679
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.890
<v Speaker 3>you don't just get on the ship and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Ho,</v>

680
00:29:16.891 --> 00:29:18.540
<v Speaker 3>let's go silent and we're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

681
00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:19.680
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably not.</v>

682
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.120
<v Speaker 3>You need to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

683
00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:25.440
<v Speaker 3>you need a route to get there and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to know what it takes to get there.</v>

684
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this fight competition.</v>

685
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

686
00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.280
<v Speaker 3>But do you know what it takes to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>

687
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.170
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

688
00:29:34.171 --> 00:29:35.640
<v Speaker 3>this is what it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

689
00:29:35.641 --> 00:29:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Are you prepared to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to do this?</v>

690
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Yes or no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if it's yes,</v>

691
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.890
<v Speaker 3>go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

692
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 3>If it's too much to</v>

693
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.570
<v Speaker 1>be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't fucking do it.</v>

694
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:43.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

695
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:48.960
<v Speaker 2>there was a time when you were a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the top of the heap where there was,</v>

696
00:29:48.961 --> 00:29:53.790
<v Speaker 2>there was debate as to like what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilder should look like.</v>

697
00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:58.791
<v Speaker 2>There was like the Frank Zane look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was like a strong obviously fit </v>

698
00:29:59.161 --> 00:30:03.300
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but much smaller and just symmetrical.</v>

699
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.210
<v Speaker 2>And then there was you that just came </v>
<v Speaker 2>out like the fucking Hulk,</v>

700
00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.210
<v Speaker 2>you then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it was almost like overwhelming</v>

701
00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.700
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was this debate to try to</v>

702
00:30:11.701 --> 00:30:12.690
<v Speaker 2>figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

703
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Because when I look at a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilders on a stage and they're </v>

704
00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.960
<v Speaker 2>trying to pick out who's number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's number two,</v>

705
00:30:18.961 --> 00:30:20.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

706
00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:23.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always assumed that it's like a lot of</v>

707
00:30:23.011 --> 00:30:25.140
<v Speaker 2>other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the deeper you are into it,</v>

708
00:30:25.141 --> 00:30:27.630
<v Speaker 2>the more you can see the intricacies of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

709
00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Whereas for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person is not a bodybuilder.</v>

710
00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:31.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all fucking huge.</v>

711
00:30:31.441 --> 00:30:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Like how can you tell who's the best?</v>

712
00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a matter of um,</v>

713
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bodybuilding,</v>

714
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

715
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.710
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's muscle size is a big factor.</v>

716
00:30:40.711 --> 00:30:42.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a big factor.</v>

717
00:30:42.511 --> 00:30:45.630
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the Mr Olympia is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

718
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:51.230
<v Speaker 1>in the era of Frank Zane and Frank Zane </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a body that probably most people </v>

719
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:52.290
<v Speaker 1>would look at and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

720
00:30:52.291 --> 00:30:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

721
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.110
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

722
00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.420
<v Speaker 1>probably look at me and say it's too </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>

723
00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the era of Frank Zane,</v>

724
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:05.940
<v Speaker 1>who was Mr Olympia was Arnold Arnold was</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Olympia.</v>

725
00:31:05.941 --> 00:31:08.130
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could argue that Frank Zane,</v>

726
00:31:08.131 --> 00:31:11.970
<v Speaker 1>his buddy his is more aesthetic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicer and prettier than Arnold,</v>

727
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:15.060
<v Speaker 1>but Arnold beach and why it just was </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

728
00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:17.220
<v Speaker 1>more freakishly impressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his bigger.</v>

729
00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.460
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee Haney was eight times Mr Olympia,</v>

730
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:26.060
<v Speaker 1>you could argue maybe Lila abroad or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or somebody like that was better </v>

731
00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.020
<v Speaker 1>proportion and put together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was much smaller.</v>

732
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.380
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

733
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Frank Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would see the gym today like a </v>

734
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.551
<v Speaker 1>regular dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of regular duties under </v>

735
00:31:37.551 --> 00:31:37.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a category now.</v>

736
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.470
<v Speaker 1>So you've got bodybuilding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

737
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.810
<v Speaker 1>but you've got other categories now that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have.</v>

738
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:48.020
<v Speaker 1>So you've got men's physique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more of this a type of </v>

739
00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:52.281
<v Speaker 1>physique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for various theoretic </v>

740
00:31:52.281 --> 00:31:52.281
<v Speaker 1>tight waist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything like that.</v>

741
00:31:52.281 --> 00:31:53.130
<v Speaker 1>And you've even got classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding,</v>

742
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.780
<v Speaker 1>which is height over weight ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

743
00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:01.940
<v Speaker 1>the guys are not that big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got different categories as a </v>

744
00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.660
<v Speaker 1>reaction to people not really liking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction that bodybuilding went and,</v>

745
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.160
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

746
00:32:05.161 --> 00:32:09.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll take responsibility for it going </v>
<v Speaker 1>the size root and um,</v>

747
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I had a nice physique when I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

748
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I had a nice physique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had nice abs and everything,</v>

749
00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:16.050
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to do this,</v>

750
00:32:16.051 --> 00:32:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this to the Max and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to see how far,</v>

751
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how big can I get,</v>

752
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.720
<v Speaker 1>how can I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how strong can I get?</v>

753
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.780
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to the Max and I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to say,</v>

754
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:25.350
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

755
00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:27.000
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a nice physique.</v>

756
00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:28.240
<v Speaker 1>I want people to say what the</v>

757
00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.460
<v Speaker 2>fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want it to do.</v>

758
00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you succeeded in that.</v>

759
00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.050
<v Speaker 2>You definitely succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

760
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.330
<v Speaker 2>The guy that inspired me to before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

761
00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:42.330
<v Speaker 1>was Tom Platz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're not with the </v>

762
00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:42.330
<v Speaker 1>fucking</v>

763
00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 3>freaky legs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the guy,</v>

764
00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I started,</v>

765
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.100
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't Mr Olympia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was very inspirational and um,</v>

766
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:55.600
<v Speaker 3>when he talked it was just full of </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy and enthusiasm for the training </v>

767
00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.760
<v Speaker 3>and pushing the body to its absolute </v>
<v Speaker 3>maximum.</v>

768
00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:01.460
<v Speaker 3>And I remember Tom Platz saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

769
00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.460
<v Speaker 3>when I walk out on stage in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilding competition,</v>

770
00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.820
<v Speaker 3>I want to see those judges there with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pencil and the paper.</v>

771
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:12.850
<v Speaker 3>And I was just wanting to fucking drop </v>
<v Speaker 3>that pencil and just say what the fuck </v>

772
00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:14.990
<v Speaker 3>is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're so big.</v>

773
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.040
<v Speaker 3>His legs were so freakishly big like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy had,</v>

774
00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:24.050
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody has really surpassed Tom Platz </v>

775
00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.430
<v Speaker 3>his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think to this day.</v>

776
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 3>It's fair to say</v>

777
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:31.660
<v Speaker 2>now is that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because it's very rare that </v>

778
00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.520
<v Speaker 2>someone's known very specifically for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>body part that we plats is known for his</v>

779
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:36.380
<v Speaker 2>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What plats made a whole career on,</v>

780
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.640
<v Speaker 2>on the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

781
00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:38.400
<v Speaker 2>not only the legs,</v>

782
00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:43.320
<v Speaker 3>the passion he had for like pushing </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself into the gym for the,</v>

783
00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:48.380
<v Speaker 3>to the absolute maximum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that inspired me to do that and try </v>

784
00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:51.440
<v Speaker 3>and take it even further and that now is</v>
<v Speaker 3>missing.</v>

785
00:33:51.441 --> 00:33:54.260
<v Speaker 3>That's not here anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now for me,</v>

786
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:56.390
<v Speaker 3>the bodybuilding and the fitness </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry,</v>

787
00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.440
<v Speaker 3>people are just really more concerned </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the cosmetic,</v>

788
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:05.830
<v Speaker 3>the look and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking their pictures and putting them </v>

789
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:09.020
<v Speaker 3>instagram and all this kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not really into as almost a </v>

790
00:34:09.501 --> 00:34:10.990
<v Speaker 3>spiritual side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

791
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
<v Speaker 3>where you want to push yourself to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>maximum and see how far you can go and </v>

792
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.330
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

793
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:19.910
<v Speaker 3>how far your mind can go into the pain </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that kind of stuff.</v>

794
00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.480
<v Speaker 3>That's not really there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

795
00:34:21.481 --> 00:34:22.550
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's missing?</v>

796
00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the element that's missing?</v>

797
00:34:24.111 --> 00:34:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Like why isn't that near?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

798
00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.880
<v Speaker 3>I dunno man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a collection of society in </v>

799
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.170
<v Speaker 3>general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People just want stuff like,</v>

800
00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want stuff easy.</v>

801
00:34:35.181 --> 00:34:35.930
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

802
00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:38.000
<v Speaker 3>everyone wants to be famous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the picture on Instagram,</v>

803
00:34:38.001 --> 00:34:40.100
<v Speaker 3>you don't need to do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just be famous.</v>

804
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:40.880
<v Speaker 3>Go on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Brother.</v>

805
00:34:40.881 --> 00:34:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Be famous for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

806
00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:43.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

807
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:49.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a reflection of the way </v>

808
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:49.300
<v Speaker 3>things are perhaps in everything.</v>

809
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.660
<v Speaker 2>But what's the difference in the way the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilders approach it today?</v>

810
00:34:51.661 --> 00:34:56.661
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're obviously doing something </v>

811
00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:56.661
<v Speaker 2>because there's still huge on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still,</v>

812
00:34:56.661 --> 00:35:00.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these giant guys that are lifting </v>

813
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.720
<v Speaker 2>weights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what element,</v>

814
00:35:00.721 --> 00:35:02.100
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the giant guys that have</v>

815
00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:07.350
<v Speaker 3>whites now that don't look quite like </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself and the guys from the nineties </v>

816
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.210
<v Speaker 3>now the guys are just big everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The waste.</v>

817
00:35:10.211 --> 00:35:11.650
<v Speaker 3>So huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything huge.</v>

818
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's 20 years since I competed in a </v>

819
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.071
<v Speaker 3>contest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't exactly know what the guys </v>

820
00:35:20.071 --> 00:35:23.641
<v Speaker 3>are using a lot more different to drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we use a lot more insulin and igf,</v>

821
00:35:24.161 --> 00:35:25.300
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

822
00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:30.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what you're seeing in the big </v>

823
00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:33.121
<v Speaker 3>guys is somewhat systemic growth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they just got bit bigger </v>

824
00:35:33.121 --> 00:35:34.820
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and that doesn't look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

825
00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:36.730
<v Speaker 3>so appealing I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

826
00:35:36.731 --> 00:35:38.410
<v Speaker 3>when their guts extent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

827
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:42.240
<v Speaker 3>So maybe the relying more on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemicals and they don't really,</v>

828
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:45.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't really heard anything from any</v>

829
00:35:45.301 --> 00:35:48.210
<v Speaker 3>of the bodybuilding champions in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last 10 or 15 years.</v>

830
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:53.211
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm interesting or new or </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary in the training methods.</v>

831
00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.650
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

832
00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't really even talk about it that </v>
<v Speaker 3>much now.</v>

833
00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 3>Everyone just does the same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know.</v>

834
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was at one point in time where no one</v>

835
00:36:01.651 --> 00:36:02.880
<v Speaker 3>talked about it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

836
00:36:02.881 --> 00:36:07.881
<v Speaker 3>Like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would get the magazines and they </v>

837
00:36:07.881 --> 00:36:07.881
<v Speaker 3>would tell you to take creatine and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could look like me,</v>

838
00:36:07.881 --> 00:36:10.410
<v Speaker 3>but everybody kind of knew who.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody who knew.</v>

839
00:36:10.411 --> 00:36:13.870
<v Speaker 3>People who knew people was somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vienna circle.</v>

840
00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:17.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I started in the eighties and</v>

841
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:22.071
<v Speaker 3>I read the magazines and a few things by</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arnold and Mike Mansa where they kind of</v>

842
00:36:23.011 --> 00:36:25.500
<v Speaker 3>admitted that use something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they've downplayed it.</v>

843
00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:30.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only for the last six weeks before </v>

844
00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.841
<v Speaker 3>a competition just to give us that last </v>
<v Speaker 3>Polish and stuff like that and ask a few</v>

845
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.280
<v Speaker 3>guys in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I first started they were a bit</v>

846
00:36:35.281 --> 00:36:36.030
<v Speaker 3>cagey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

847
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:36.650
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

848
00:36:36.651 --> 00:36:37.160
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

849
00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.340
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do that.</v>

850
00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.670
<v Speaker 3>And later on I found out they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all doing it,</v>

851
00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:41.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

852
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:43.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

853
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.680
<v Speaker 3>and it was very much an inner circle in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the gym.</v>

854
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:50.730
<v Speaker 3>Bodybuilders now everybody knows about </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids and now it's mainstream.</v>

855
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:56.120
<v Speaker 3>And guys take steroids now just for </v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmetic reasons because they want to </v>

856
00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.830
<v Speaker 3>look bigger and harder and quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

857
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.620
<v Speaker 3>I just equate it to women having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>botox.</v>

858
00:37:01.621 --> 00:37:04.110
<v Speaker 3>So having some implants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys want to look bigger.</v>

859
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to work so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to,</v>

860
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just want to quick,</v>

861
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:12.411
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get guys coming to the gym and </v>

862
00:37:12.411 --> 00:37:12.411
<v Speaker 3>that just takes steroids pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight away.</v>

863
00:37:12.411 --> 00:37:17.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily learn how to train </v>

864
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.210
<v Speaker 3>really properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

865
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:23.750
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just competitive bodybuilders </v>

866
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.750
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

867
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:24.390
<v Speaker 3>it's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's everywhere.</v>

868
00:37:24.391 --> 00:37:25.950
<v Speaker 3>It's mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at Hollywood,</v>

869
00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:27.660
<v Speaker 3>you look at hip hop artists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

870
00:37:27.661 --> 00:37:28.440
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all,</v>

871
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.220
<v Speaker 3>they're all doing a bit of juice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

872
00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at nearly 10 years ago and look at </v>

873
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:35.250
<v Speaker 3>him now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

874
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:35.260
<v Speaker 3>He was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't really been interested in La.</v>

875
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.320
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of them.</v>

876
00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Nearly a cool J.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

877
00:37:39.601 --> 00:37:40.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all,</v>

878
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.950
<v Speaker 3>they're all jack man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm know it's not fully me.</v>

879
00:37:43.951 --> 00:37:46.680
<v Speaker 3>I can see what's going on guys from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood,</v>

880
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:48.570
<v Speaker 3>they want to get in shape quickly for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

881
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:54.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys just want to look good on the </v>

882
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.230
<v Speaker 3>beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

883
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.230
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

884
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:55.020
<v Speaker 3>it's everywhere now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's main course.</v>

885
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.190
<v Speaker 3>There's nearly damp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

886
00:37:56.191 --> 00:37:57.150
<v Speaker 3>he's checked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

887
00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.770
<v Speaker 3>We saw a picture of a huge Jackman when </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was preparing for Wolverine was doing</v>

888
00:38:01.771 --> 00:38:06.771
<v Speaker 3>dead lifts and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was in his forties and someone was </v>

889
00:38:06.771 --> 00:38:06.771
<v Speaker 3>asking me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think he's,</v>

890
00:38:06.771 --> 00:38:07.650
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

891
00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

892
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.180
<v Speaker 3>how much did it get paid for the movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well?</v>

893
00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well No,</v>

894
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:16.710
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like tip for a guy that is not really </v>

895
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:17.320
<v Speaker 3>that kind of an athlete to all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden look like that.</v>

896
00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:22.320
<v Speaker 3>Like you got to make some radical </v>
<v Speaker 3>physiological changes and a couple of </v>

897
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.900
<v Speaker 3>months like that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not even a good picture of man.</v>

898
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:26.840
<v Speaker 3>It's real good pictures of them checked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

899
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:28.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's pictures of him from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie too,</v>

900
00:38:28.741 --> 00:38:30.600
<v Speaker 3>which just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's enormous.</v>

901
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:35.660
<v Speaker 3>Like he just became an enormous guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is like how much did he </v>

902
00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 3>get paid for the movie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my point is,</v>

903
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got paid for that.</v>

904
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:42.580
<v Speaker 3>So maybe he took her little health risk </v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever.</v>

905
00:38:42.581 --> 00:38:45.520
<v Speaker 3>You can debate that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's getting paid for it,</v>

906
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:47.920
<v Speaker 3>but is it worth it if you're just doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

907
00:38:47.921 --> 00:38:52.921
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking look good on the beach and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all look good for the girls or </v>

908
00:38:52.921 --> 00:38:52.921
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

909
00:38:52.921 --> 00:38:55.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to put it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the.</v>

910
00:38:55.261 --> 00:38:56.080
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

911
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.620
<v Speaker 3>Once you get on that merry go round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to get off.</v>

912
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.730
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

913
00:39:00.731 --> 00:39:03.790
<v Speaker 3>And you don't want to get off because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you took some stuff.</v>

914
00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got bigger,</v>

915
00:39:06.131 --> 00:39:07.600
<v Speaker 3>you getting more attention from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls.</v>

916
00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:11.260
<v Speaker 3>Now guys got more respect for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your self confidence is up.</v>

917
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.230
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't lose all that man.</v>

918
00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:19.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking personally because what I took </v>

919
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:19.540
<v Speaker 3>it for a competitive sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to stop that.</v>

920
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.080
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>

921
00:39:20.081 --> 00:39:21.370
<v Speaker 3>But that was my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my question.</v>

922
00:39:21.371 --> 00:39:26.371
<v Speaker 3>Like how did you just accept the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you were no longer a superhuman </v>

923
00:39:26.371 --> 00:39:29.350
<v Speaker 3>looking freak show of a man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you became a regular man.</v>

924
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:35.190
<v Speaker 3>Was there a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My whole thing was see if with </v>

925
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:37.300
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilding competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

926
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I never showed my physique even in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gym with the guys that are trained with.</v>

927
00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:46.890
<v Speaker 3>I was covered up all the time if I want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to look at my physique and practice my </v>

928
00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:46.890
<v Speaker 3>poses and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it at home.</v>

929
00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:48.970
<v Speaker 3>So on the street I always wore long </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleeve.</v>

930
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a shit about anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

931
00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Because I did it purely for competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But why did you cover it?</v>

932
00:39:54.371 --> 00:39:59.371
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you just dress like with a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's freaking wanted attention </v>

933
00:39:59.371 --> 00:40:00.310
<v Speaker 3>all the fucking time and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in it,</v>

934
00:40:00.311 --> 00:40:05.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a quiet guy and I just wanted to go </v>

935
00:40:05.311 --> 00:40:07.680
<v Speaker 3>about my business and reveal this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been working on [inaudible].</v>

936
00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.570
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see it as being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost removed.</v>

937
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:15.571
<v Speaker 3>It's like a statue I'm working on so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't tied up in like I was tied up in </v>

938
00:40:16.751 --> 00:40:18.670
<v Speaker 3>being Mr Olympia because that's who I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was and that,</v>

939
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat a,</v>

940
00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:21.460
<v Speaker 3>a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

941
00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:25.360
<v Speaker 3>what the whole huge body and I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't need that for,</v>

942
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:26.890
<v Speaker 3>for everyday use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

943
00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:31.891
<v Speaker 3>that sort of fits with this whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>Spartan image that people had a view </v>

944
00:40:31.891 --> 00:40:36.310
<v Speaker 3>that you are the image of you was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy that was just doing work that </v>

945
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.500
<v Speaker 3>other people weren't willing to do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of quiet isolation somewhere.</v>

946
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.830
<v Speaker 3>So literally we're not as deep basement </v>
<v Speaker 3>a basement in Birmingham,</v>

947
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:43.530
<v Speaker 3>England where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

948
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.720
<v Speaker 3>it's not exactly a hotbed of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilding activity,</v>

949
00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:50.440
<v Speaker 3>no beaches or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an industrial city.</v>

950
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I just locked myself away there and </v>

951
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:55.870
<v Speaker 3>worked on this project and I love doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

952
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:58.430
<v Speaker 3>I love just being in that tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

953
00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.780
<v Speaker 3>seeing what I can do and obviously the </v>
<v Speaker 3>further you get along,</v>

954
00:41:01.781 --> 00:41:04.150
<v Speaker 3>the more difficult it is to make any </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of improvements.</v>

955
00:41:04.151 --> 00:41:05.780
<v Speaker 3>But I was trying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

956
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:09.220
<v Speaker 3>that's fascinating to look at it that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way is almost like an art project.</v>

957
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:12.150
<v Speaker 3>There was a statue I was removed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was not my,</v>

958
00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.490
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't like building this body so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could get,</v>

959
00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:20.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>admiring from the girls or the guys </v>

960
00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:23.070
<v Speaker 3>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was already like a fit strong guy </v>

961
00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:26.371
<v Speaker 3>before I started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't come from that place of </v>

962
00:41:26.371 --> 00:41:28.681
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to do this to make myself feel </v>

963
00:41:28.681 --> 00:41:30.661
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to do this because I have some </v>

964
00:41:30.661 --> 00:41:31.480
<v Speaker 3>talent for it and I can change my life </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this.</v>

965
00:41:31.481 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I didn't know it was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr Olympia,</v>

966
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.560
<v Speaker 1>but I just knew that if I put my energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>into this,</v>

967
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.360
<v Speaker 1>something positive was going to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>

968
00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.300
<v Speaker 1>And after a few years I won the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>Championship.</v>

969
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.510
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

970
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I was British champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a car.</v>

971
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.100
<v Speaker 1>I went home to a one bedroom apartment </v>
<v Speaker 1>with no furniture.</v>

972
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.830
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even have a proper bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a mattress on the floor,</v>

973
00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't the British championship.</v>

974
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:58.130
<v Speaker 1>And because of that somebody put up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money for me to open a gym.</v>

975
00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Then I had a gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it was making an income from my </v>

976
00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:03.360
<v Speaker 1>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if it went that far,</v>

977
00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:03.730
<v Speaker 1>it would have been worth it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

978
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

979
00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:07.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that attitude is probably what's</v>

980
00:42:07.581 --> 00:42:11.090
<v Speaker 3>made you like very healthy mentally </v>
<v Speaker 3>afterwards,</v>

981
00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:14.210
<v Speaker 3>what are separate from your body and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was a project,</v>

982
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:15.450
<v Speaker 3>there was a paragraph</v>

983
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:20.480
<v Speaker 1>the way it was very tough because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sky or was Mr Olympia and this is </v>

984
00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.160
<v Speaker 1>solely been doing since I was 21 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

985
00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:28.370
<v Speaker 1>And then I got an injury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my exit from the sport was not </v>

986
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:32.451
<v Speaker 1>calculated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told my tricep tendon on the left </v>

987
00:42:32.451 --> 00:42:35.730
<v Speaker 1>elbow and this had already won injury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bicep tear.</v>

988
00:42:35.731 --> 00:42:39.150
<v Speaker 1>But I kind of handled that and it didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect my training too much,</v>

989
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.920
<v Speaker 1>but this was almost a complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>detachment that I have to repair.</v>

990
00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.480
<v Speaker 1>And after that I just knew I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't lift properly and like,</v>

991
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:51.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't compete with the rest of the </v>

992
00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:51.520
<v Speaker 1>world if you can't lift properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

993
00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:55.880
<v Speaker 1>so I had to retire and then I was lucky </v>
<v Speaker 1>in limbo as know who the fuck am I and </v>

994
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.860
<v Speaker 1>what am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do with my life?</v>

995
00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:00.930
<v Speaker 1>So it took me a few years to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly get back,</v>

996
00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:02.460
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

997
00:43:02.461 --> 00:43:04.140
<v Speaker 1>I've lost my muscles when I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

998
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Like it was more about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

999
00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what my role is in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who I am.</v>

1000
00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:13.970
<v Speaker 1>It took me a long time to find that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of athletes that </v>

1001
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:15.990
<v Speaker 1>retired from sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the same same issues.</v>

1002
00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:17.730
<v Speaker 3>It's a giant issue with fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1003
00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:22.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got this fucking tunnel that </v>

1004
00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:22.740
<v Speaker 3>you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1005
00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:23.290
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like being at war like </v>
<v Speaker 3>stressful,</v>

1006
00:43:23.291 --> 00:43:25.930
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got this role and this,</v>

1007
00:43:25.931 --> 00:43:27.640
<v Speaker 3>this thing that you just aim and for all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them</v>

1008
00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:31.080
<v Speaker 1>time and now it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck you going to do?</v>

1009
00:43:31.081 --> 00:43:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Who are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's all about,</v>

1010
00:43:32.971 --> 00:43:37.971
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it took me years to kind of come to </v>

1011
00:43:38.311 --> 00:43:40.770
<v Speaker 1>peace with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't about losing the muscles.</v>

1012
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.730
<v Speaker 1>It was about losing my goal and my focus</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my role in life.</v>

1013
00:43:44.731 --> 00:43:45.120
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1014
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:45.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1015
00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:50.810
<v Speaker 3>for a lot of athletes it's the intensity</v>
<v Speaker 3>of life is all of a sudden reduce down </v>

1016
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:55.611
<v Speaker 3>to a mundane normal guy and lows and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mediums the time.</v>

1017
00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I turned it around because when I </v>

1018
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:03.550
<v Speaker 1>was doing bodybuilding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life was very restrictive,</v>

1019
00:44:03.551 --> 00:44:04.710
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking monk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1020
00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.960
<v Speaker 1>I just had this regime and I didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to socialize.</v>

1021
00:44:07.961 --> 00:44:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to do anything outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1022
00:44:09.521 --> 00:44:12.940
<v Speaker 1>So after some time I came like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1023
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:15.780
<v Speaker 1>so you can't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>

1024
00:44:15.781 --> 00:44:20.781
<v Speaker 1>how about the thousand and one things </v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't do when you were doing that </v>

1025
00:44:20.781 --> 00:44:22.360
<v Speaker 1>because you couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you couldn't do all those things.</v>

1026
00:44:22.361 --> 00:44:26.770
<v Speaker 1>You can go a do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not eat all day if you don't want to eat</v>

1027
00:44:26.771 --> 00:44:28.390
<v Speaker 1>six meals a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do what you want,</v>

1028
00:44:28.391 --> 00:44:33.391
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started looking into some other </v>

1029
00:44:33.391 --> 00:44:35.851
<v Speaker 1>things was interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always been interested in </v>

1030
00:44:35.851 --> 00:44:38.331
<v Speaker 1>wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started going a few safaris and </v>

1031
00:44:38.331 --> 00:44:38.940
<v Speaker 1>things like that and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly I realized like,</v>

1032
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a million and one things you can</v>

1033
00:44:41.851 --> 00:44:43.980
<v Speaker 1>do in life like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1034
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.240
<v Speaker 1>get over this.</v>

1035
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:47.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a transitionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>transitional period.</v>

1036
00:44:47.731 --> 00:44:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1037
00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:53.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can absolutely see why many athletes </v>

1038
00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:53.260
<v Speaker 1>struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1039
00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Frank Bruno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>

1040
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:55.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a boxer,</v>

1041
00:44:55.530 --> 00:45:00.530
<v Speaker 1>well boxing champion from Uk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he had a really hard time and </v>

1042
00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:01.700
<v Speaker 1>almost like he was world champion when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was Mr Olympian.</v>

1043
00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:07.180
<v Speaker 1>We've tried at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both got divorced like everything </v>

1044
00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:07.180
<v Speaker 1>falls apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1045
00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:07.180
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1046
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you hopefully rebuild back to </v>

1047
00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:12.480
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1048
00:45:12.481 --> 00:45:17.481
<v Speaker 1>It seems that very few athletes have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>smooth process into retirement and </v>

1049
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
<v Speaker 1>fighters in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always come back when they </v>

1050
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:23.000
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1051
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Well I know why they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

1052
00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:26.190
<v Speaker 1>I was always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is Ali coming back,</v>

1053
00:45:26.191 --> 00:45:27.010
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just,</v>

1054
00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:32.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the greatest and now he's going to </v>

1055
00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:32.410
<v Speaker 1>get beat by some guy cause it's coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1056
00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:34.230
<v Speaker 1>What do you miss the fucking adrenaline </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is,</v>

1057
00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:35.300
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1058
00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.520
<v Speaker 1>that all your focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your soul,</v>

1059
00:45:38.521 --> 00:45:40.530
<v Speaker 1>everything is going into that one point.</v>

1060
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.320
<v Speaker 1>And like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough to replace,</v>

1061
00:45:43.321 --> 00:45:45.300
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to know when it's time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>step down.</v>

1062
00:45:45.301 --> 00:45:48.810
<v Speaker 1>I think now when you did decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you have a plan,</v>

1063
00:45:48.811 --> 00:45:53.811
<v Speaker 1>did you write out a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how to step down because he wrote </v>

1064
00:45:53.811 --> 00:45:53.811
<v Speaker 1>out a plan for the rest of your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1065
00:45:53.811 --> 00:45:55.220
<v Speaker 1>because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like new.</v>

1066
00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Tara was like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1067
00:45:56.311 --> 00:45:59.850
<v Speaker 1>it was like I didn't have a plan for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>injury.</v>

1068
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaguely.</v>

1069
00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I had an idea in my mind that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to open more germs when I finished </v>

1070
00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:07.950
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually,</v>

1071
00:46:07.951 --> 00:46:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I didn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1072
00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I started my own nutrition company which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is still doing sports nutrition during </v>

1073
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:15.390
<v Speaker 1>unites a sports nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1074
00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:21.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put a lot of energy into that and a </v>

1075
00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.630
<v Speaker 1>different things and being able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience things in life that I shut </v>

1076
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:24.030
<v Speaker 1>myself off with.</v>

1077
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:28.200
<v Speaker 1>So that's how I dealt with it and now I </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel I felt great about it and I kind of</v>

1078
00:46:28.201 --> 00:46:31.740
<v Speaker 1>look back and I can sit back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1079
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't give any more to that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have given any more.</v>

1080
00:46:36.061 --> 00:46:38.370
<v Speaker 1>So there's no regrets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of athletes,</v>

1081
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:40.890
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're young and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1082
00:46:40.891 --> 00:46:45.891
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't really appreciate it so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much and then when it's gone you're </v>

1083
00:46:45.891 --> 00:46:45.891
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit man,</v>

1084
00:46:45.891 --> 00:46:46.170
<v Speaker 1>what if I'd done this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if,</v>

1085
00:46:46.171 --> 00:46:46.770
<v Speaker 1>what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if,</v>

1086
00:46:46.771 --> 00:46:47.890
<v Speaker 1>what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1087
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't have those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What ifs?</v>

1088
00:46:49.111 --> 00:46:54.111
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did 100 percent even too much to the </v>

1089
00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:54.660
<v Speaker 1>point where I got injured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm,</v>

1090
00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy with that.</v>

1091
00:46:56.791 --> 00:46:58.870
<v Speaker 1>I can put that to rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great lesson.</v>

1092
00:46:58.871 --> 00:47:00.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a great lesson for young people </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up.</v>

1093
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:04.200
<v Speaker 1>If you just do all the work when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>

1094
00:47:04.201 --> 00:47:06.240
<v Speaker 1>it's so what you can do it man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>win or lose,</v>

1095
00:47:06.241 --> 00:47:09.030
<v Speaker 1>you do what you can do and then you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self satisfaction,</v>

1096
00:47:09.031 --> 00:47:10.590
<v Speaker 1>the pride to look back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1097
00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I fucking give it everything I had and </v>
<v Speaker 1>no regrets.</v>

1098
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:19.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way I feel about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know there's a lot of my </v>

1099
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:20.370
<v Speaker 1>contemporaries that compete against me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really feel like that.</v>

1100
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:23.730
<v Speaker 1>That's why a few of them are still there</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fifties and the making comebacks.</v>

1101
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the most horrible things </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see someone who's lived a life of </v>

1102
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:29.070
<v Speaker 1>regret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1103
00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 1>This has</v>

1104
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:34.990
<v Speaker 3>just narrative and I don't like to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>athletes coming back when they're not as</v>

1105
00:47:35.441 --> 00:47:38.230
<v Speaker 3>you remember them at their best and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're coming back and the not so good,</v>

1106
00:47:38.231 --> 00:47:43.231
<v Speaker 3>which I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but inevitably at 50 years old is going </v>

1107
00:47:43.231 --> 00:47:46.951
<v Speaker 3>to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any body builders are doing </v>

1108
00:47:46.951 --> 00:47:46.951
<v Speaker 3>that now at 50?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1109
00:47:46.951 --> 00:47:47.940
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Love Ron who came second to me and</v>

1110
00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.890
<v Speaker 3>Mr Olympia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He made a comeback last year.</v>

1111
00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1112
00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.480
<v Speaker 3>How do you look?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1113
00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.050
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends how I answered that question.</v>

1114
00:47:56.051 --> 00:48:01.051
<v Speaker 3>How did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did it look compared to previously </v>

1115
00:48:01.051 --> 00:48:04.320
<v Speaker 3>not good at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How to look for a guy that's making a </v>

1116
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:04.320
<v Speaker 3>comeback at 50 years old?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1117
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:08.880
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not a 50 year old guy looking </v>

1118
00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.160
<v Speaker 3>good contest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This Mr Olympia as well.</v>

1119
00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:12.010
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1120
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just tried to make it come back within a</v>

1121
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:16.540
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't take many,</v>

1122
00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:18.370
<v Speaker 3>many years to get to that kind of shape.</v>

1123
00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:23.180
<v Speaker 3>So I was the thing with bodybuilding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1124
00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:28.310
<v Speaker 3>you've got a thing called muscle memory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe it took me 10 years to get to </v>

1125
00:48:29.291 --> 00:48:33.910
<v Speaker 3>be 260 pounds ripped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now that information is in my DNA.</v>

1126
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:39.270
<v Speaker 3>It's there so I could theoretically not </v>
<v Speaker 3>trained for 10 years.</v>

1127
00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.050
<v Speaker 3>Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that muscle,</v>

1128
00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:43.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably get that back in six to 12 </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

1129
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1130
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:49.800
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I've heard of muscle memory and I </v>

1131
00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.820
<v Speaker 3>know that it's a thing but it hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>been physically isolated.</v>

1132
00:48:51.821 --> 00:48:54.220
<v Speaker 3>What causes that or how it is in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>DNA?</v>

1133
00:48:55.060 --> 00:49:00.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really sure if they have or if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're interested enough to do to the </v>

1134
00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.080
<v Speaker 3>studies that's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those of us that are in the sport,</v>

1135
00:49:02.081 --> 00:49:06.760
<v Speaker 3>we know it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean arnold did it like a 1974.</v>

1136
00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:11.880
<v Speaker 3>I think Arnold was gonna retire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it got this pumping iron movie </v>

1137
00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:13.180
<v Speaker 3>that everyone's familiar with.</v>

1138
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the 1975 Mr Olympia,</v>

1139
00:49:16.271 --> 00:49:21.271
<v Speaker 3>which the pumping iron and runs around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he basically made a comeback for that </v>

1140
00:49:21.271 --> 00:49:24.940
<v Speaker 3>just just for the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And previous to that he did a movie </v>

1141
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:29.191
<v Speaker 3>called stay hungry with Sally Field and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Bridges and I think he had to get </v>

1142
00:49:29.191 --> 00:49:29.500
<v Speaker 3>down to like 200,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200,</v>

1143
00:49:29.501 --> 00:49:32.800
<v Speaker 3>10 pounds because the director didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want them to be too big for that.</v>

1144
00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:38.160
<v Speaker 3>So he came off the back of that and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>just put all the sides back on for the </v>

1145
00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:38.320
<v Speaker 3>Mr Olympia for pumping it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1146
00:49:38.321 --> 00:49:43.321
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the director made him sort of a </v>

1147
00:49:43.321 --> 00:49:43.321
<v Speaker 3>macy's himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1148
00:49:43.321 --> 00:49:44.110
<v Speaker 3>he still looked pretty big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess for the average person.</v>

1149
00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

1150
00:49:45.251 --> 00:49:49.300
<v Speaker 3>That's nothing compared to how he looks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But next to Jeff Bridges.</v>

1151
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:54.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he looks like a really big fit </v>

1152
00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:54.660
<v Speaker 3>guy that you'd see at the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at Jeff Bridges.</v>

1153
00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.390
<v Speaker 3>The dude abides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked to do.</v>

1154
00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.940
<v Speaker 3>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's still around,</v>

1155
00:50:00.941 --> 00:50:05.941
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still banging out great movies and </v>

1156
00:50:05.941 --> 00:50:05.941
<v Speaker 3>talking about how many great movies that</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy's been in.</v>

1157
00:50:05.941 --> 00:50:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the one where he's a country </v>

1158
00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:10.620
<v Speaker 3>singer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was great.</v>

1159
00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1160
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:11.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1161
00:50:11.291 --> 00:50:12.700
<v Speaker 3>That was recent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1162
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:14.410
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that.</v>

1163
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:15.250
<v Speaker 3>That was a good movie.</v>

1164
00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1165
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:20.170
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's good at choosing roles.</v>

1166
00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:25.440
<v Speaker 3>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when a guy does get down to something </v>

1167
00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.621
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it a matter of taking less steroids </v>

1168
00:50:28.621 --> 00:50:31.381
<v Speaker 3>working out last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your body just naturally starts to </v>

1169
00:50:31.381 --> 00:50:31.381
<v Speaker 3>shrink</v>

1170
00:50:31.381 --> 00:50:31.381
<v Speaker 1>pure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1171
00:50:31.381 --> 00:50:35.860
<v Speaker 1>if you're taking steroids and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped and you're going to lose a lot </v>

1172
00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.520
<v Speaker 1>of weight pretty quick and maybe just </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't lift weights,</v>

1173
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.130
<v Speaker 1>play tennis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do swim into something else,</v>

1174
00:50:40.131 --> 00:50:41.990
<v Speaker 1>and your muscle mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to go down.</v>

1175
00:50:41.991 --> 00:50:43.250
<v Speaker 1>So I'm guessing that's what it is.</v>

1176
00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.520
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you first started bodybuilding,</v>

1177
00:50:45.521 --> 00:50:48.220
<v Speaker 3>how long did it take before you did take</v>
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>

1178
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:54.130
<v Speaker 1>After about 18 months I decided I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do a contest and I knew the guys in </v>

1179
00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:54.560
<v Speaker 1>the contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're taking stuff.</v>

1180
00:50:54.561 --> 00:50:57.050
<v Speaker 1>So I just want to be on a level playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>field with them.</v>

1181
00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like two months before my first </v>

1182
00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.880
<v Speaker 1>contest in which take a little ballot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Debo,</v>

1183
00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.650
<v Speaker 1>20 milligrams a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a day.</v>

1184
00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:11.600
<v Speaker 1>That was the first thing I ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then narrowed to the contest,</v>

1185
00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:16.601
<v Speaker 1>I switched to some Var and Prima Bolin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean 20 milligrams a day is like </v>

1186
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.860
<v Speaker 1>fitness chicks take that.</v>

1187
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:22.730
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they do,</v>

1188
00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.070
<v Speaker 3>do take steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1189
00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.830
<v Speaker 3>Means paying hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent,</v>

1190
00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:32.200
<v Speaker 3>even bikini chicks like skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because they want to look harder,</v>

1191
00:51:32.201 --> 00:51:34.480
<v Speaker 3>they went a leaner and it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1192
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:39.350
<v Speaker 3>I got girls that are fucking strippers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all kinds of chicks asking me,</v>

1193
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:40.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1194
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:42.560
<v Speaker 3>I want to take this [inaudible] stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1195
00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:43.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything about that.</v>

1196
00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do to you.</v>

1197
00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy just told me it's gonna.</v>

1198
00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Make me lean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everything</v>

1199
00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:50.400
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1200
00:51:50.401 --> 00:51:53.970
<v Speaker 1>let me explain what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an anabolic steroid and anabolic</v>

1201
00:51:53.971 --> 00:51:57.120
<v Speaker 1>steroid is a derivative of testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a male hormone.</v>

1202
00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:02.540
<v Speaker 1>So what they try to do is minimize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>androgenic part of the testosterone,</v>

1203
00:52:02.671 --> 00:52:06.810
<v Speaker 1>the male like and so you're left with </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of the anabolic,</v>

1204
00:52:06.811 --> 00:52:11.811
<v Speaker 1>the building part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't completely minimize the </v>

1205
00:52:11.811 --> 00:52:14.850
<v Speaker 1>androgenic part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though stuff like winstrol Lavar</v>

1206
00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:19.850
<v Speaker 1>is less androgenic men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone is still derived from a </v>

1207
00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:22.851
<v Speaker 1>male hormone and if you take off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still going to get the male side </v>

1208
00:52:22.851 --> 00:52:26.841
<v Speaker 1>effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty common in women's </v>

1209
00:52:26.841 --> 00:52:26.841
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding and fitness and so on.</v>

1210
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:29.000
<v Speaker 3>It's common in athletics across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>board.</v>

1211
00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:32.390
<v Speaker 3>We see it in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We see it in women in MMA as well.</v>

1212
00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1213
00:52:33.001 --> 00:52:36.330
<v Speaker 1>if you're a competitive sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a competitive athlete,</v>

1214
00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:39.100
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do whatever you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1215
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:44.150
<v Speaker 1>so when I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a study was done by a guy </v>

1216
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:48.111
<v Speaker 1>called Dr Goldman and it's called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Goldman's dilemma and he asked a bunch </v>

1217
00:52:48.361 --> 00:52:53.361
<v Speaker 1>of athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm including the Olympic level </v>

1218
00:52:53.361 --> 00:52:56.751
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if I could give you a pill that would</v>

1219
00:52:56.911 --> 00:53:01.911
<v Speaker 1>guarantee you would win the gold medal </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the equivalent is in your </v>

1220
00:53:01.911 --> 00:53:02.310
<v Speaker 1>sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you would die at like 40,</v>

1221
00:53:02.311 --> 00:53:03.900
<v Speaker 1>45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you take it?</v>

1222
00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:07.920
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of people said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would take it.</v>

1223
00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:10.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the mentality you're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1224
00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.050
<v Speaker 1>especially when when you're young man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1225
00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:15.090
<v Speaker 1>You feel indestructable like nothing's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna,</v>

1226
00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:15.630
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1227
00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem real to write.</v>

1228
00:53:18.171 --> 00:53:20.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like global warming will one day </v>
<v Speaker 3>make the seas rise.</v>

1229
00:53:20.811 --> 00:53:22.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not right now.</v>

1230
00:53:22.131 --> 00:53:25.350
<v Speaker 3>So fire up the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I want to fucking gold medal.</v>

1231
00:53:25.351 --> 00:53:26.310
<v Speaker 3>That's all I'm interested</v>

1232
00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:26.940
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even.</v>

1233
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:32.360
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here now on the fucking gold medal </v>

1234
00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.060
<v Speaker 1>and this is the mentality of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1235
00:53:33.061 --> 00:53:38.061
<v Speaker 1>the successful athlete and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it applies to everything or maybe </v>

1236
00:53:38.491 --> 00:53:43.491
<v Speaker 1>it was a fucking businessman if you said</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take this pill and you'll fucking </v>

1237
00:53:43.491 --> 00:53:43.500
<v Speaker 1>make billions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like would you do it,</v>

1238
00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:49.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>driven businessman of probably say fuck </v>

1239
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.130
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it if it's a solution that allow</v>

1240
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.130
<v Speaker 1>you to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1241
00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I did.</v>

1242
00:53:51.781 --> 00:53:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider that I did a calculated risk,</v>

1243
00:53:55.210 --> 00:54:00.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as taking steroids with the </v>

1244
00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:02.070
<v Speaker 1>possible negative health effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I tried to monitor.</v>

1245
00:54:02.071 --> 00:54:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I had doctor's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1246
00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:05.550
<v Speaker 1>blood test and everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if something was going wrong,</v>

1247
00:54:05.551 --> 00:54:07.320
<v Speaker 1>at least out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1248
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.720
<v Speaker 1>did you ever find anything wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1249
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:14.750
<v Speaker 1>some things were a little bit out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal range when I was heavy and my </v>

1250
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:16.560
<v Speaker 1>blood pressure went up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not sky high,</v>

1251
00:54:16.561 --> 00:54:17.290
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1252
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:19.410
<v Speaker 1>40 over 90 1:50</v>
<v Speaker 1>over 90.</v>

1253
00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:24.410
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was edging up there but it was 300 </v>

1254
00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:24.410
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1255
00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:25.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

1256
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:30.090
<v Speaker 1>couple of other readings were a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit but nothing of great concern,</v>

1257
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1258
00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:37.220
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean to say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>harmless because it's over a period of </v>

1259
00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:37.220
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1260
00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:40.110
<v Speaker 1>And I equate it to smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1261
00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:45.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you smoke for 10 years and then you </v>

1262
00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.440
<v Speaker 1>stop apparently after 15 or 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're back to like,</v>

1263
00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:50.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy that didn't smoke if you smoke for</v>

1264
00:54:50.161 --> 00:54:51.900
<v Speaker 1>20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 years,</v>

1265
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:57.080
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's a different story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen Chris Bells </v>

1266
00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:57.080
<v Speaker 1>documentary bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

1267
00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 1>faster?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

1268
00:54:57.601 --> 00:54:58.620
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1269
00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.590
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm due to speak with those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brothers,</v>

1270
00:55:01.591 --> 00:55:01.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1271
00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Chris and I think I'll be going on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast at one point,</v>

1272
00:55:05.191 --> 00:55:06.800
<v Speaker 1>but I actually haven't watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1273
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Great guys,</v>

1274
00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:12.700
<v Speaker 2>really great guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both been on here a couple times </v>

1275
00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:14.771
<v Speaker 2>and very knowledgeable and Chris is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just did a great documentary called </v>

1276
00:55:14.771 --> 00:55:18.680
<v Speaker 2>prescription thugs to about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescription drug industry and you know,</v>

1277
00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:22.970
<v Speaker 2>getting people hooked on these pain </v>
<v Speaker 2>pills but in bigger,</v>

1278
00:55:22.971 --> 00:55:23.750
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster.</v>

1279
00:55:23.751 --> 00:55:27.740
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that was fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it was that he was going over,</v>

1280
00:55:27.741 --> 00:55:29.450
<v Speaker 2>like we were told that this is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill.</v>

1281
00:55:29.451 --> 00:55:32.950
<v Speaker 2>You were told that all these health </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative health effects,</v>

1282
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.250
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where's the bodies?</v>

1283
00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Where are the bodies like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you think about all the things that </v>

1284
00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:39.550
<v Speaker 2>kill people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obesity,</v>

1285
00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:40.550
<v Speaker 2>crushes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>

1286
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:45.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is one of the number one causes of </v>

1287
00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:45.640
<v Speaker 2>death in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet it's looked at</v>

1288
00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:49.360
<v Speaker 1>like smoking alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescription drugs.</v>

1289
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things.</v>

1290
00:55:50.061 --> 00:55:53.250
<v Speaker 1>All these things that have been some </v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths in bodybuilding,</v>

1291
00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1292
00:55:55.440 --> 00:56:00.440
<v Speaker 1>that may be attributed to steroids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been a couple that definitely </v>

1293
00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.060
<v Speaker 1>attributed to diuretics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1294
00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:02.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diuretics,</v>

1295
00:56:02.671 --> 00:56:04.070
<v Speaker 1>you lose a lot of water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1296
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:07.410
<v Speaker 1>you can lose electrolytes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>potassium and sodium,</v>

1297
00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:12.830
<v Speaker 1>which regulates your heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you're playing Russian roulette </v>

1298
00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:15.711
<v Speaker 1>with a bit on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of people played that game and </v>

1299
00:56:15.711 --> 00:56:15.711
<v Speaker 1>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1300
00:56:15.711 --> 00:56:15.711
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting thing to point out</v>

1301
00:56:15.711 --> 00:56:17.650
<v Speaker 2>because the diuretic aspect is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is critical.</v>

1302
00:56:17.651 --> 00:56:21.250
<v Speaker 2>When you see someone on stage and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see them shredded,</v>

1303
00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:23.860
<v Speaker 2>those guys are basically almost dead,</v>

1304
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:24.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1305
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:30.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like probably the least healthiest </v>

1306
00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:32.490
<v Speaker 3>fucking point you've been all year is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is when you're looking like that on the </v>

1307
00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:32.490
<v Speaker 3>stove.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

1308
00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:34.390
<v Speaker 3>You look amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I can tell you,</v>

1309
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:35.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel weak as a kitten.</v>

1310
00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:39.090
<v Speaker 3>You don't feel real good at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1311
00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:41.890
<v Speaker 3>you do whatever you got to do what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>required.</v>

1312
00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>996 when I was competing,</v>

1313
00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:50.110
<v Speaker 3>they had actually a testing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>diuretics because there was a couple of </v>

1314
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:52.470
<v Speaker 3>deaths and the people in charge started </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting concerned,</v>

1315
00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:58.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't look good and that affects </v>

1316
00:56:58.310 --> 00:56:58.310
<v Speaker 3>your revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1317
00:56:58.310 --> 00:56:59.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't attempt.</v>

1318
00:56:59.711 --> 00:57:04.711
<v Speaker 3>They attempted steroid testing in 1990 </v>
<v Speaker 3>but it affected the guys look so much </v>

1319
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:07.910
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1320
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:12.930
<v Speaker 3>once you've seen a guy like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so once you've seen a guy fight like </v>

1321
00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:13.270
<v Speaker 3>this or once you've seen a guy run this </v>
<v Speaker 3>fast,</v>

1322
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.780
<v Speaker 3>nobody fucking wants to see anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>slower than that or less than that.</v>

1323
00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.350
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want,</v>

1324
00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:23.370
<v Speaker 3>it's just not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they realize that real quick like </v>

1325
00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:23.620
<v Speaker 3>fuck list with just forget about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroid testing.</v>

1326
00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:25.590
<v Speaker 3>And anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steroid testing is like,</v>

1327
00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:31.560
<v Speaker 3>it probably just makes it more unfair </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the guy that's got more </v>

1328
00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.490
<v Speaker 3>information and like the clearance times</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that stuff,</v>

1329
00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.050
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to stop people from </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking it,</v>

1330
00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:36.880
<v Speaker 3>they're just going to take it and try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>avoid,</v>

1331
00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:42.150
<v Speaker 3>get round the test and it's the same in </v>
<v Speaker 3>all sports and I don't care if it's </v>

1332
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:43.750
<v Speaker 3>fucking running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>riding Tour de France,</v>

1333
00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.270
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going on to some degree.</v>

1334
00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.630
<v Speaker 3>What would the UFC has done and they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>self imposed.</v>

1335
00:57:49.631 --> 00:57:51.940
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've hired Jeff Novitsky,</v>

1336
00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:57.180
<v Speaker 3>the guy who went after Lance Armstrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's had to Usada and they just do </v>

1337
00:57:57.731 --> 00:58:01.090
<v Speaker 3>random tests on our ended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The punishments are terrible,</v>

1338
00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:03.280
<v Speaker 3>like two year suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1339
00:58:03.281 --> 00:58:06.310
<v Speaker 3>I think first time you get pop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first time for steroids.</v>

1340
00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:08.650
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a two year suspension now </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the UFC.</v>

1341
00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:10.520
<v Speaker 3>And this is again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is self imposed.</v>

1342
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:15.570
<v Speaker 3>It's not even in Nevada state athletic </v>
<v Speaker 3>commission or any other athletic </v>

1343
00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:15.570
<v Speaker 3>commissions in positions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1344
00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:20.430
<v Speaker 3>they've radically cut back on the amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people that are first of all caught </v>

1345
00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:23.870
<v Speaker 3>in second of all doing steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just not doing it,</v>

1346
00:58:23.871 --> 00:58:26.580
<v Speaker 3>but if you do real random testing you </v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

1347
00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have a better chance of </v>

1348
00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:35.940
<v Speaker 3>eliminating something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It pisses athletes off because you </v>

1349
00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:36.340
<v Speaker 3>awaken these fighters up at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning and they need the rest,</v>

1350
00:58:36.341 --> 00:58:38.560
<v Speaker 3>but they take the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take the urine,</v>

1351
00:58:38.561 --> 00:58:43.561
<v Speaker 3>see you go back to sleep and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way nobody can be safe and you've </v>

1352
00:58:43.561 --> 00:58:46.050
<v Speaker 3>seen a radical change and performances </v>
<v Speaker 3>and some athletes have.</v>

1353
00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.710
<v Speaker 3>People were suspecting of doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids.</v>

1354
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:52.950
<v Speaker 3>They changed the way they look like </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many pre and Post Usada </v>

1355
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:55.870
<v Speaker 3>pictures of people that post them on </v>
<v Speaker 3>like twitter and facebook and stuff like</v>

1356
00:58:55.871 --> 00:58:56.790
<v Speaker 3>that where they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1357
00:58:56.791 --> 00:58:59.500
<v Speaker 3>in these groups where they talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights and like who's.</v>

1358
00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:02.800
<v Speaker 3>You know what chaff cleats had been hurt</v>
<v Speaker 3>most by Usada.</v>

1359
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:03.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1360
00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:05.710
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because the more of the</v>

1361
00:59:05.711 --> 00:59:08.170
<v Speaker 3>bigger guys or it's across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bigger guys,</v>

1362
00:59:08.171 --> 00:59:13.171
<v Speaker 3>but it's also epo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of guys have been popped for </v>

1363
00:59:13.171 --> 00:59:13.171
<v Speaker 3>epo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been popped for.</v>

1364
00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.640
<v Speaker 3>What does that other side?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mel Melatonin.</v>

1365
00:59:15.641 --> 00:59:17.320
<v Speaker 3>There's another one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God dammit,</v>

1366
00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:20.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a similar thing to epo,</v>

1367
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:22.170
<v Speaker 3>EPO,</v>
<v Speaker 3>increase red blood cell count,</v>

1368
00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:24.900
<v Speaker 1>so you get more oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would give you more endurance.</v>

1369
00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:25.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>

1370
00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:27.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's giant in the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1371
00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:32.501
<v Speaker 4>I mean physical size is not really that </v>
<v Speaker 4>much of a consideration is very few guys</v>

1372
00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:34.800
<v Speaker 4>that are really big and muscular.</v>

1373
00:59:34.850 --> 00:59:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Well here's the thing with steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that can give you muscle size but</v>

1374
00:59:38.181 --> 00:59:43.181
<v Speaker 1>it depends on your training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the training you're doing so it can </v>

1375
00:59:43.181 --> 00:59:47.801
<v Speaker 1>also help with their insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just because the guy is not big and </v>

1376
00:59:47.801 --> 00:59:49.280
<v Speaker 1>muscular doesn't mean there's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit from steroids.</v>

1377
00:59:49.281 --> 00:59:53.090
<v Speaker 1>You get runners and cyclists and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lance Armstrong,</v>

1378
00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1379
00:59:55.551 --> 01:00:00.551
<v Speaker 1>he was on a pedestal and then is </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonized and is down here like let's </v>

1380
01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:03.980
<v Speaker 1>say the owner guy using a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone or you know.</v>

1381
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:04.980
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a,</v>

1382
01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:10.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Burr was a good friend of mine and </v>

1383
01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:10.210
<v Speaker 4>stand up comedian had a hilarious bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it and he's like,</v>

1384
01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.490
<v Speaker 4>are psychopath was better than you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychopath.</v>

1385
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:15.130
<v Speaker 4>You got a dirty sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1386
01:00:15.131 --> 01:00:17.470
<v Speaker 4>we just have one psycho that was more </v>
<v Speaker 4>psycho.</v>

1387
01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:18.190
<v Speaker 4>You're psycho.</v>

1388
01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.750
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had testicular cancer,</v>

1389
01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1390
01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:26.590
<v Speaker 1>So I'm assuming then you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>producing any testosterone,</v>

1391
01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.850
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to have to put it in from </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

1392
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:30.130
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1393
01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:35.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had it in the used to allow </v>

1394
01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:35.430
<v Speaker 4>testosterone replacement therapy for </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters.</v>

1395
01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:38.250
<v Speaker 4>They don't allow that anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys are abusing it.</v>

1396
01:00:38.251 --> 01:00:43.251
<v Speaker 4>And also there was a questions of why </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were losing testosterone in the </v>

1397
01:00:43.251 --> 01:00:47.241
<v Speaker 4>first place and one of the thoughts was </v>
<v Speaker 4>damaged to pituitary gland because </v>

1398
01:00:47.241 --> 01:00:49.410
<v Speaker 4>that's apparently a big factor with </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters.</v>

1399
01:00:49.650 --> 01:00:52.920
<v Speaker 4>Once they developed damage to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pituitary gland from head trauma,</v>

1400
01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:56.760
<v Speaker 4>they start decreasing the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>testosterone in their body produces.</v>

1401
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.270
<v Speaker 4>And so the thought was put it back in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but other doctors are saying,</v>

1402
01:01:00.271 --> 01:01:02.520
<v Speaker 4>well maybe you shouldn't be competing </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

1403
01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:05.070
<v Speaker 4>Maybe put it back in for general health </v>
<v Speaker 4>and wellness,</v>

1404
01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:10.520
<v Speaker 4>but you probably shouldn't be competing </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore if this is the way your body's </v>

1405
01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:10.520
<v Speaker 4>responding to head trauma.</v>

1406
01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it shouldn't really need replacement</v>

1407
01:01:12.421 --> 01:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>testosterone until you're like 40 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>thereabouts,</v>

1408
01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it shouldn't be producing still.</v>

1409
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.140
<v Speaker 1>And there's ways to up it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1410
01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Even natural supplements to up it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A despotic asset as long as,</v>

1411
01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:31.610
<v Speaker 1>what is d aspartic acid despotic I said </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a compound,</v>

1412
01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's from amino acids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

1413
01:01:33.331 --> 01:01:38.331
<v Speaker 1>they've done studies on it that shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it can raise your own natural </v>

1414
01:01:38.331 --> 01:01:38.610
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some herbs,</v>

1415
01:01:38.970 --> 01:01:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Tribulus Terrestris also has some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1416
01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some studies to back that up.</v>

1417
01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Also exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1418
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Like high intensity exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sprint,</v>

1419
01:01:48.991 --> 01:01:53.991
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of squats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much it's going to make a </v>

1420
01:01:53.991 --> 01:01:53.991
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know.</v>

1421
01:01:53.991 --> 01:01:54.330
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy,</v>

1422
01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.510
<v Speaker 1>heavy exercise would raise the </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone over normal baseline.</v>

1423
01:01:57.511 --> 01:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>But once it gets to a certain age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts declining.</v>

1424
01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1425
01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:06.720
<v Speaker 4>Now when you started taking stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you started off with d ball,</v>

1426
01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.670
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like at the height,</v>

1427
01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.310
<v Speaker 4>what was the craziest amount of shit you</v>
<v Speaker 4>were taken?</v>

1428
01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:15.040
<v Speaker 1>The most stuff I took was in the off </v>
<v Speaker 1>season when I was trying to real heavy,</v>

1429
01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>trying to build sized because I had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>raise him that used to get ready for </v>

1430
01:02:20.101 --> 01:02:24.980
<v Speaker 1>contests and I was always known for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really coming in in shape.</v>

1431
01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't use so much stuff getting </v>

1432
01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>ready for a contest you use more in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>off season,</v>

1433
01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>so like a thousand milligrams of </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone a week.</v>

1434
01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some decker to rebel and maybe 500 </v>

1435
01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:43.641
<v Speaker 1>milligrams and Debo maybe 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 milligrams is average and growth </v>

1436
01:02:43.641 --> 01:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>hormone in the off season I saw a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1437
01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:50.610
<v Speaker 1>It's probably about 30 percent of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys are taken now.</v>

1438
01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>I think so based on what people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me,</v>

1439
01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have people come to train with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that haven't even done a competition,</v>

1440
01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:06.380
<v Speaker 1>let alone the Mr Olympia and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their stack is more than that because </v>

1441
01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:06.990
<v Speaker 1>they found it on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1442
01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:11.991
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why I just saw it on the </v>

1443
01:03:11.991 --> 01:03:13.970
<v Speaker 1>internet somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1444
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean you go on the Internet and have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>look for Dorian yates stack.</v>

1445
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've been on there and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1446
01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:23.460
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of this stuff,</v>

1447
01:03:23.461 --> 01:03:25.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1448
01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:30.170
<v Speaker 1>So I don't even know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the rest of the stuff that I do </v>

1449
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:30.170
<v Speaker 1>recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you take this,</v>

1450
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:31.080
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get real health </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

1451
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.840
<v Speaker 1>So like is an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1452
01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean instantly taken too much insulin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you fucking kill over in a coma.</v>

1453
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried incident in the last couple of </v>

1454
01:03:43.630 --> 01:03:45.620
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was competing because there's a few </v>

1455
01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:48.021
<v Speaker 1>guys started using it and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't feel that I've benefited </v>

1456
01:03:48.021 --> 01:03:49.290
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a bit bigger,</v>

1457
01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:53.040
<v Speaker 1>I got more bloated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conditioning was harder to get.</v>

1458
01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for me,</v>

1459
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel I get any benefit from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get bigger,</v>

1460
01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:00.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1461
01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:02.960
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was known for like Super Hot,</v>

1462
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:06.600
<v Speaker 1>grainy quality and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was losing a little bit of that.</v>

1463
01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:09.150
<v Speaker 1>He was an insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's my opinion.</v>

1464
01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:14.180
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't recommend it to people that are </v>

1465
01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.840
<v Speaker 1>trained with because it doesn't have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>real benefits and has,</v>

1466
01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:17.430
<v Speaker 1>has risks go why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1467
01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.380
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the quality,</v>

1468
01:04:19.381 --> 01:04:22.770
<v Speaker 1>like what constitutes the quality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle that you looking for?</v>

1469
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1470
01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:24.630
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1471
01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:30.140
<v Speaker 1>in my case I was known for muscle </v>
<v Speaker 1>density so you could have a 20 inch arm </v>

1472
01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.880
<v Speaker 1>that's like got good volume.</v>

1473
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:36.120
<v Speaker 1>We have 20 inch on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a fucking block of steel.</v>

1474
01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:38.820
<v Speaker 1>So how do you get that look how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference?</v>

1475
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I think the differences in the training </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've trained very heavy and </v>

1476
01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.630
<v Speaker 1>primarily quite low reps compared to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilders.</v>

1477
01:04:45.631 --> 01:04:48.360
<v Speaker 1>I was working in six to eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six to eight,</v>

1478
01:04:48.361 --> 01:04:49.980
<v Speaker 1>a little bit high on the legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 to 12,</v>

1479
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:55.430
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything I did was like six to eight </v>

1480
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:56.961
<v Speaker 1>reps where most of the guys that do </v>
<v Speaker 1>intend to 12 and they relying more on </v>

1481
01:04:56.961 --> 01:05:01.131
<v Speaker 1>pumping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting a lot of blood volume into </v>

1482
01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:01.320
<v Speaker 1>the muscle rather than overloading it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1483
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:05.490
<v Speaker 1>so I had a density in a powerful look to</v>
<v Speaker 1>my physique that the other guys,</v>

1484
01:05:05.491 --> 01:05:07.080
<v Speaker 1>when they stood next to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1485
01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:12.350
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was just from really heavy </v>

1486
01:05:12.350 --> 01:05:15.261
<v Speaker 1>training I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get the density of the muscle </v>

1487
01:05:15.261 --> 01:05:15.261
<v Speaker 1>rather than just pumping it volume one.</v>

1488
01:05:15.261 --> 01:05:18.250
<v Speaker 1>How did you figure out how to make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>number like six to eight,</v>

1489
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>like why not three to five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know what I'm saying?</v>

1490
01:05:21.101 --> 01:05:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Like how did you arrive over over many </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>

1491
01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:29.790
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the gym and also studies as </v>

1492
01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most studies would say for muscle growth</v>

1493
01:05:31.241 --> 01:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>you need to keep the muscle under </v>
<v Speaker 1>tension from about a 40 to 60 seconds,</v>

1494
01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.390
<v Speaker 1>which in most cases would be eight to 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>reps,</v>

1495
01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:42.130
<v Speaker 1>so I went a bit lower like six to eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>a that worked really well for me,</v>

1496
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:44.200
<v Speaker 1>but not on legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went higher,</v>

1497
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>10 or 12 on on the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just a bit of trial and error.</v>

1498
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>We know I'm the lower reps will give you</v>
<v Speaker 1>more strength and more power without the</v>

1499
01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:59.820
<v Speaker 1>hypertrophy of the growth of the muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's ideal for fighters.</v>

1500
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>I worked with a few fighters in the UK </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I tried to explain this to them and </v>

1501
01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.340
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for them to grasp because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think I'm in the ring.</v>

1502
01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:07.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1503
01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I need insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1504
01:06:09.461 --> 01:06:10.990
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're already doing that.</v>

1505
01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.640
<v Speaker 1>You're already doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1506
01:06:12.641 --> 01:06:16.240
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to get more power behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>the punch,</v>

1507
01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.570
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to build muscle </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you build muscle,</v>

1508
01:06:19.571 --> 01:06:21.340
<v Speaker 1>you put on weight and then you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>the white category.</v>

1509
01:06:21.341 --> 01:06:26.341
<v Speaker 1>So whatever more power you got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be negated by the fact </v>

1510
01:06:26.341 --> 01:06:28.300
<v Speaker 1>that you fight fighting heavier guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you could stay the same weight but</v>

1511
01:06:28.301 --> 01:06:30.910
<v Speaker 1>be more powerful and stronger with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>building muscle size,</v>

1512
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:32.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the key.</v>

1513
01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:35.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically like power lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low reps,</v>

1514
01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:39.550
<v Speaker 1>three reps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then have a really long rest totally</v>

1515
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:43.060
<v Speaker 1>foreign to mma training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to do a bom,</v>

1516
01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Bom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bom,</v>

1517
01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:45.850
<v Speaker 1>put it back and wait for three or four </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

1518
01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it again.</v>

1519
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:50.170
<v Speaker 1>So you get that bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power behind a punch,</v>

1520
01:06:50.171 --> 01:06:53.560
<v Speaker 1>but without rest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but without increasing your muscle size,</v>

1521
01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:55.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that would,</v>

1522
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:56.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1523
01:06:56.261 --> 01:06:58.630
<v Speaker 1>if you get more power behind your punch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going up a weight class,</v>

1524
01:06:58.631 --> 01:07:00.570
<v Speaker 1>like so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1525
01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.920
<v Speaker 1>you want to stay in the same weight but </v>
<v Speaker 1>be stronger.</v>

1526
01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:06.670
<v Speaker 1>That would be ideal for a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that seems counterintuitive for a lot</v>

1527
01:07:06.671 --> 01:07:09.130
<v Speaker 1>of people because they assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger muscles mean more power.</v>

1528
01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1529
01:07:11.141 --> 01:07:13.960
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilders have got a bigger muscles </v>
<v Speaker 1>and power lifters.</v>

1530
01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:16.720
<v Speaker 1>How lyft is going to lift more weight at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least for one or two reps,</v>

1531
01:07:16.721 --> 01:07:17.290
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1532
01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.790
<v Speaker 1>They're training for that power boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1533
01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with weightlifting is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of reps,</v>

1534
01:07:22.391 --> 01:07:27.391
<v Speaker 1>but very explosive and powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hard for people understand </v>

1535
01:07:27.391 --> 01:07:27.391
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1536
01:07:27.391 --> 01:07:27.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw it up,</v>

1537
01:07:27.941 --> 01:07:28.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1538
01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.850
<v Speaker 1>well that's the thing about kettlebell </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitors.</v>

1539
01:07:30.851 --> 01:07:35.620
<v Speaker 1>They'd not the biggest guys like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the internal musculature,</v>

1540
01:07:35.621 --> 01:07:37.780
<v Speaker 1>the call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of the lifting,</v>

1541
01:07:37.781 --> 01:07:38.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1542
01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:39.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1543
01:07:39.821 --> 01:07:44.110
<v Speaker 1>if you're throwing a punch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean who cares if you got huge biceps,</v>

1544
01:07:44.111 --> 01:07:46.240
<v Speaker 1>it's like the internal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1545
01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:51.290
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible all the way up through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>call that's going to give you that </v>

1546
01:07:51.290 --> 01:07:51.310
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to go.</v>

1547
01:07:51.311 --> 01:07:55.240
<v Speaker 1>He's like feed or I mean Elanco who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of him.</v>

1548
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I like his fighting style as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1549
01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guy looks like he's got arms </v>

1550
01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.570
<v Speaker 1>like sticks is it looks like he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pot belly,</v>

1551
01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.270
<v Speaker 1>it looks out of shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I can hit like a baseball bat man</v>

1552
01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:10.330
<v Speaker 1>early in his career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was bigger.</v>

1553
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and he stopped training weights and </v>

1554
01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 1>started training only sports specific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1555
01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:20.540
<v Speaker 2>it's a very controversial subject </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you talked to modern strength</v>

1556
01:08:20.541 --> 01:08:25.541
<v Speaker 2>and conditioning coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said it's absolutely the wrong </v>

1557
01:08:25.541 --> 01:08:27.581
<v Speaker 2>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if a door continued to do strength </v>

1558
01:08:27.581 --> 01:08:28.000
<v Speaker 2>and conditioning along with his martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts training,</v>

1559
01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:30.110
<v Speaker 2>he probably would have been able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prolong his career.</v>

1560
01:08:30.111 --> 01:08:34.400
<v Speaker 2>But who the fuck knows if that's true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a very,</v>

1561
01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to say what would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

1562
01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:43.780
<v Speaker 2>but the modern approach seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have to consider strength and </v>

1563
01:08:44.301 --> 01:08:49.301
<v Speaker 2>conditioning as a huge part of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>regimen in terms of like some of the </v>

1564
01:08:49.701 --> 01:08:54.701
<v Speaker 2>elite athletes focus primarily on </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength and conditioning and camp and </v>

1565
01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:57.470
<v Speaker 2>not really unskilled work because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like they already know how to fight</v>

1566
01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:00.560
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's already the conditioning.</v>

1567
01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:02.120
<v Speaker 2>It's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1568
01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:03.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean as far as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1569
01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:06.950
<v Speaker 2>the conditioning of their emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ability to react is already there.</v>

1570
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:12.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of building the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate gas tank and having the body </v>

1571
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:16.421
<v Speaker 2>that can perform and react as quickly </v>
<v Speaker 2>and as fast and recover as fast as </v>

1572
01:09:16.421 --> 01:09:16.421
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1573
01:09:16.421 --> 01:09:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got the guys that hit the </v>

1574
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:21.080
<v Speaker 1>hottest that not necessarily the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscular though,</v>

1575
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:21.080
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

1576
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.550
<v Speaker 2>some of them are like tyron Woodley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the UFC welterweight champion.</v>

1577
01:09:24.551 --> 01:09:29.551
<v Speaker 2>He's one rare guy that kind of violates </v>
<v Speaker 2>the normal build of a professional mma </v>

1578
01:09:31.301 --> 01:09:36.070
<v Speaker 2>athletes because he's fucking jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's also,</v>

1579
01:09:36.190 --> 01:09:41.190
<v Speaker 2>he's also very smart in his approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like he's the consequences of </v>

1580
01:09:41.190 --> 01:09:46.141
<v Speaker 2>engaging with him or extreme because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>has tremendous power so he can pace </v>

1581
01:09:47.031 --> 01:09:52.031
<v Speaker 2>himself more than like maybe some guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>can because if you get in a firefight </v>

1582
01:09:52.031 --> 01:09:56.341
<v Speaker 2>with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one shot from him put the lights </v>

1583
01:09:56.341 --> 01:09:57.550
<v Speaker 2>out on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's got this ability to.</v>

1584
01:09:57.610 --> 01:10:02.610
<v Speaker 2>And he's developed a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting way of fighting where </v>

1585
01:10:02.861 --> 01:10:06.910
<v Speaker 2>he just paces his bursts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's bursts are so terrifying.</v>

1586
01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.720
<v Speaker 2>Like when he comes at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he can,</v>

1587
01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:14.760
<v Speaker 2>when he does sprint your way so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster than the average fighter and so </v>

1588
01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.481
<v Speaker 2>much stronger that I guess in his mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>having all that muscle and he says it's </v>

1589
01:10:18.481 --> 01:10:19.860
<v Speaker 2>actually natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just said he and his son.</v>

1590
01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Is it genetic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1591
01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:27.090
<v Speaker 1>My son is doing bodybuilding and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a particularly good a </v>

1592
01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.480
<v Speaker 1>fried chicken and burgers and stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his like shredded all the time.</v>

1593
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:36.590
<v Speaker 1>It will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyron son is jacked and he's a little </v>

1594
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.590
<v Speaker 1>kid and he's parked on genetics are </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

1595
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:37.690
<v Speaker 1>There's no denying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like me.</v>

1596
01:10:37.691 --> 01:10:40.390
<v Speaker 1>When I started I had already a physique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the ABS,</v>

1597
01:10:40.391 --> 01:10:41.950
<v Speaker 1>I was laying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the shape.</v>

1598
01:10:41.951 --> 01:10:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Everything was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that to get bigger.</v>

1599
01:10:44.861 --> 01:10:48.070
<v Speaker 1>So jeans are a big thing as far as your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body type.</v>

1600
01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:50.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it insurmountable?</v>

1601
01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Like if a guy has shit genes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can he become like a jack?</v>

1602
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:54.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1603
01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:55.770
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1604
01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.800
<v Speaker 1>It can get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get better.</v>

1605
01:10:58.801 --> 01:11:03.230
<v Speaker 1>But you can't be Lee Haney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a rare individual that you know,</v>

1606
01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:08.360
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Mr Olympia stage is probably </v>

1607
01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:11.270
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe millions of guys around the world </v>

1608
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:13.200
<v Speaker 1>that in the gym training and maybe it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to compete.</v>

1609
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you know,</v>

1610
01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Kinda kinda everybody be a UFC champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can everybody be a basketball player?</v>

1611
01:11:19.781 --> 01:11:24.781
<v Speaker 1>I know you need certain tools to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and then you've got to work on that</v>

1612
01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:25.680
<v Speaker 1>and build that.</v>

1613
01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.900
<v Speaker 4>But at least for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for athletes and fighters in particular,</v>

1614
01:11:28.901 --> 01:11:30.820
<v Speaker 4>you see guys who don't have impressive </v>
<v Speaker 4>physiques had,</v>

1615
01:11:30.821 --> 01:11:35.821
<v Speaker 4>have incredible records and wound up </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing really well with their skill and </v>

1616
01:11:35.821 --> 01:11:37.970
<v Speaker 4>their tactics and their mindset and </v>
<v Speaker 4>their understanding of when to engage,</v>

1617
01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:40.780
<v Speaker 4>when not to engage with bodybuilding </v>
<v Speaker 4>dough.</v>

1618
01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.300
<v Speaker 4>It's a very specific look if you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>born with like slope,</v>

1619
01:11:43.301 --> 01:11:45.490
<v Speaker 4>shoulders and small hands and</v>

1620
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:46.880
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1621
01:11:46.881 --> 01:11:48.110
<v Speaker 1>You need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1622
01:11:48.111 --> 01:11:50.120
<v Speaker 1>you need the frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frame.</v>

1623
01:11:50.121 --> 01:11:51.470
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the bone structure.</v>

1624
01:11:51.471 --> 01:11:53.450
<v Speaker 1>You can't do anything about that with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the training,</v>

1625
01:11:53.451 --> 01:11:58.451
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need a relatively wide shoulders </v>

1626
01:11:58.451 --> 01:12:02.320
<v Speaker 1>to smaller hips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need the limbs to be proportional </v>

1627
01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.530
<v Speaker 1>for bodybuilding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1628
01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:08.680
<v Speaker 1>most of the successful guys that tend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a little bit longer legs compared </v>

1629
01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.801
<v Speaker 1>to the torso because it just looks more </v>
<v Speaker 1>authentic and makes the upper body </v>

1630
01:12:11.801 --> 01:12:12.920
<v Speaker 1>looked more like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a bone structure.</v>

1631
01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:16.640
<v Speaker 1>You can't do anything about it that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be born with a bone structure.</v>

1632
01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got muscle bellies,</v>

1633
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:22.370
<v Speaker 1>so you got the length of the muscle </v>
<v Speaker 1>belly,</v>

1634
01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.250
<v Speaker 1>which is genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you've got a short bicep,</v>

1635
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to tell you I'll go to the gym and </v>

1636
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.910
<v Speaker 1>do preacher calls and we get along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1637
01:12:31.330 --> 01:12:33.980
<v Speaker 1>you have your muscle attachments are </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic.</v>

1638
01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:38.570
<v Speaker 1>So the longer your muscle bellies are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more potential they have for volume.</v>

1639
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:44.110
<v Speaker 1>So somebody that's got uniformly long </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle bellies with a good frame and a </v>

1640
01:12:45.321 --> 01:12:47.990
<v Speaker 1>good metabolism that tends to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally low body fat.</v>

1641
01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Then you're looking at somebody with </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential to be a good competitive </v>

1642
01:12:53.530 --> 01:12:53.660
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they don't have all those things,</v>

1643
01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:57.620
<v Speaker 1>everyone can improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But are you going to go win contests?</v>

1644
01:12:57.621 --> 01:12:57.950
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1645
01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:59.920
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever had a guy come to you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

1646
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:01.660
<v Speaker 4>and I want to be a champion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you like kid,</v>

1647
01:13:01.661 --> 01:13:02.080
<v Speaker 4>you're fucked.</v>

1648
01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

1649
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1650
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:05.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1651
01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:10.220
<v Speaker 4>Dorian Yates tells you you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't say I try to be a little bit </v>

1652
01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:12.380
<v Speaker 4>more subtle than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1653
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1654
01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:16.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1655
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:19.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here to bullshit anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if somebody asks me,</v>

1656
01:13:19.221 --> 01:13:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to tell him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1657
01:13:20.361 --> 01:13:21.840
<v Speaker 1>you can improve man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

1658
01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:26.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to waste your time if </v>

1659
01:13:26.890 --> 01:13:26.890
<v Speaker 1>you're driven by a Mr Olympia because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1660
01:13:26.890 --> 01:13:27.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't be rude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just,</v>

1661
01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:31.030
<v Speaker 1>you just don't have what it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like enjoy your training.</v>

1662
01:13:32.530 --> 01:13:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have fun in the gym.</v>

1663
01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.430
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgot about that because it's not going</v>

1664
01:13:37.431 --> 01:13:39.140
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hard for people to hear though,</v>

1665
01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's better than me blowing smoke up</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ass and saying,</v>

1666
01:13:42.471 --> 01:13:43.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1667
01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:43.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1668
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.350
<v Speaker 1>pay me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

1669
01:13:45.351 --> 01:13:47.060
<v Speaker 1>you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have whatever you want,</v>

1670
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:52.090
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because somebody else is going to tell </v>

1671
01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:52.090
<v Speaker 1>him that.</v>

1672
01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:52.090
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen a guy that you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1673
01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:53.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he became a great bodybuilder?</v>

1674
01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1675
01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:56.310
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1676
01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:58.260
<v Speaker 1>I can pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've been around like,</v>

1677
01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:00.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1678
01:14:00.591 --> 01:14:05.591
<v Speaker 1>a 35 years I've been in this guy man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I can see people and I've seen people</v>

1679
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:11.570
<v Speaker 1>probably with more potential than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they don't get anywhere because </v>

1680
01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 1>they don't apply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1681
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:14.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to have the physical stuff,</v>

1682
01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:19.890
<v Speaker 3>but the glue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that holds it all together is </v>

1683
01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:20.860
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've seen freaks in a gym,</v>

1684
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:22.160
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1685
01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:24.310
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not that smart.</v>

1686
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:27.580
<v Speaker 3>They don't really understand everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going on.</v>

1687
01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:31.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and usually when somebody gets something</v>

1688
01:14:31.151 --> 01:14:32.920
<v Speaker 3>real easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>

1689
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:34.990
<v Speaker 3>they're not really that hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1690
01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:39.520
<v Speaker 3>So it's not necessarily always the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the most potential that,</v>

1691
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:44.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can beat somebody with more </v>

1692
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.950
<v Speaker 3>potential by being smarter and working </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard,</v>

1693
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.950
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1694
01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:46.810
<v Speaker 3>72 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1695
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:52.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I've always said that like </v>

1696
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.110
<v Speaker 3>you can get a guy who's the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>dedicated,</v>

1697
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:55.621
<v Speaker 3>the most hungry wanted the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you're competing in basketball </v>

1698
01:14:55.621 --> 01:14:56.640
<v Speaker 3>against Michael Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1699
01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:01.800
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of fucked because he wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>it bad too and his genetics are just so </v>

1700
01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.330
<v Speaker 3>superior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just no way around.</v>

1701
01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:04.920
<v Speaker 3>So you can't equalize that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1702
01:15:04.921 --> 01:15:05.840
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1703
01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:09.750
<v Speaker 3>I saw this thing in England recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guy came over from the states,</v>

1704
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:11.860
<v Speaker 3>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what his name was,</v>

1705
01:15:11.861 --> 01:15:13.690
<v Speaker 3>but it was a good martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a kickbox.</v>

1706
01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.520
<v Speaker 3>He was dedicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was lean and fit,</v>

1707
01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:21.120
<v Speaker 3>and it came over to fight this gypsy </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight or over in England and this guy's </v>

1708
01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.780
<v Speaker 3>like fat out of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He turned up like 45 minutes late for </v>

1709
01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:28.801
<v Speaker 3>the flight because it had been drunk the</v>
<v Speaker 3>night before and he came in and it's </v>

1710
01:15:28.801 --> 01:15:31.510
<v Speaker 3>just fat and it looked like shit and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>for like half an hour.</v>

1711
01:15:31.511 --> 01:15:33.130
<v Speaker 3>He's getting his ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1712
01:15:33.131 --> 01:15:34.350
<v Speaker 3>they're not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1713
01:15:34.351 --> 01:15:37.630
<v Speaker 3>he woke up and it kicked the other guy's</v>
<v Speaker 3>s.</v>

1714
01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:42.720
<v Speaker 3>So this guy has been training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been dedicated as he's doing all </v>

1715
01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.020
<v Speaker 3>this stuff and this guy is the night </v>
<v Speaker 3>before is getting drunk,</v>

1716
01:15:44.021 --> 01:15:45.940
<v Speaker 3>but he still come in and kick the guy's </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

1717
01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:50.940
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it probably just had more potential or </v>

1718
01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:50.940
<v Speaker 3>he had a hot head or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1719
01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:52.810
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of factors involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>

1720
01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:56.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean his experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his ability to take punishment that some</v>

1721
01:15:56.081 --> 01:16:01.081
<v Speaker 3>of it is just inherent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some people just have a like a </v>

1722
01:16:01.081 --> 01:16:01.840
<v Speaker 3>wider face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger neck.</v>

1723
01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.460
<v Speaker 3>They can take a shot better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1724
01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.600
<v Speaker 3>There's oral genetic characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1725
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:09.670
<v Speaker 3>The ability to absorb punches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to be,</v>

1726
01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:14.140
<v Speaker 3>or at least the variables seem to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of it based on maybe you've got sick</v>

1727
01:16:14.141 --> 01:16:17.820
<v Speaker 3>of bones or a shorter neck so your brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't rattle as much or something.</v>

1728
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:22.830
<v Speaker 3>Mark is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is one of the best kick boxers of </v>

1729
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:25.741
<v Speaker 3>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And from New Zealand just to tank of a </v>

1730
01:16:25.741 --> 01:16:25.741
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1731
01:16:25.741 --> 01:16:29.700
<v Speaker 3>five foot 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>265 pounds just built like a brick </v>

1732
01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:30.760
<v Speaker 3>shithouse oh dude.</v>

1733
01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:35.760
<v Speaker 3>Cro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cop had kicked him and he went down and </v>

1734
01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:35.800
<v Speaker 3>got right back up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like nobody does a cro.</v>

1735
01:16:35.801 --> 01:16:37.630
<v Speaker 3>Cop had cakes you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a wrap,</v>

1736
01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:42.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's one of the few guys that </v>

1737
01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:42.660
<v Speaker 3>survived it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1738
01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:43.660
<v Speaker 3>I got a my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my business partner from New Zealand,</v>

1739
01:16:44.170 --> 01:16:47.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he told me about Malcolm is I've got</v>

1740
01:16:47.021 --> 01:16:52.021
<v Speaker 3>a brother and the dad used to get them </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the back yard there and just like </v>

1741
01:16:52.021 --> 01:16:55.600
<v Speaker 3>knock the shit out of each other until </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like immune to getting hit.</v>

1742
01:16:55.730 --> 01:16:57.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel it anymore.</v>

1743
01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:02.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been knocked out a few times </v>

1744
01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:02.280
<v Speaker 3>recently like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1745
01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:02.830
<v Speaker 3>he's in his forties now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't it the case with fighters?</v>

1746
01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:03.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I noticed that.</v>

1747
01:17:03.871 --> 01:17:08.871
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a guy that's like seems to be </v>

1748
01:17:08.871 --> 01:17:10.921
<v Speaker 3>invincible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it gets knocked out and then after </v>

1749
01:17:10.921 --> 01:17:10.921
<v Speaker 3>that he it like</v>

1750
01:17:10.921 --> 01:17:12.740
<v Speaker 1>chocolate down for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>

1751
01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unquestioned.</v>

1752
01:17:14.231 --> 01:17:14.720
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

1753
01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:20.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain does not want to take that </v>

1754
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.971
<v Speaker 4>kind of punishment anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And with Chuck explained to me was that </v>

1755
01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:27.260
<v Speaker 4>when it gets to a point where your brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>realizes that you're too tough and </v>

1756
01:17:28.381 --> 01:17:33.090
<v Speaker 4>you're just going to absorb this </v>
<v Speaker 4>punishment and it just shuts itself down</v>

1757
01:17:33.091 --> 01:17:36.360
<v Speaker 4>to protect it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's how he described it now.</v>

1758
01:17:36.361 --> 01:17:39.180
<v Speaker 4>And obviously that's not like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuroscientist describing it.</v>

1759
01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:44.360
<v Speaker 4>There's also the connective tissue that </v>
<v Speaker 4>keeps the brain connected and inside </v>

1760
01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.240
<v Speaker 4>that it gets looser and more torn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen connective tissue?</v>

1761
01:17:48.241 --> 01:17:53.241
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a strong version of cotton candy </v>

1762
01:17:53.241 --> 01:17:54.150
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like it's not.</v>

1763
01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:59.540
<v Speaker 4>It's not the toughest stuff in the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not supposed to take that many </v>

1764
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:03.621
<v Speaker 4>beatings in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had that many beatings over a </v>

1765
01:18:03.621 --> 01:18:04.350
<v Speaker 4>certain point that you'd be dead </v>
<v Speaker 4>already,</v>

1766
01:18:04.351 --> 01:18:05.640
<v Speaker 4>somebody would've already eaten you.</v>

1767
01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:10.920
<v Speaker 1>But a MMA seems to be safer than boxing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't hit as many times</v>

1768
01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:14.850
<v Speaker 4>sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1769
01:18:14.851 --> 01:18:19.851
<v Speaker 4>I would say probably overall safer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's like saying motorcycle racing</v>

1770
01:18:21.210 --> 01:18:26.210
<v Speaker 4>is safer than like going down hill and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>skateboard 60 miles an hour.</v>

1771
01:18:26.611 --> 01:18:28.470
<v Speaker 4>You're kind of fucked all relative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1772
01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:33.471
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the study that they did that </v>

1773
01:18:33.471 --> 01:18:34.860
<v Speaker 4>just came out this week on football </v>
<v Speaker 4>players would show they did.</v>

1774
01:18:34.861 --> 01:18:39.861
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did a test on 111 fighters are 111 </v>

1775
01:18:39.861 --> 01:18:44.721
<v Speaker 4>football players.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred and 10 had traumatic brain </v>

1776
01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:44.721
<v Speaker 4>injuries.</v>

1777
01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I saw the movie account numbers called </v>
<v Speaker 1>now with the brain damage was causing </v>

1778
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:52.280
<v Speaker 1>the guys to be violent and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1779
01:18:52.281 --> 01:18:57.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were saying that 87 percent of </v>

1780
01:18:57.281 --> 01:18:57.980
<v Speaker 1>football players at all levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high school,</v>

1781
01:18:58.370 --> 01:19:00.070
<v Speaker 1>college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1782
01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:04.370
<v Speaker 1>all levels have traumatic brain injury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 seven percent of what you're going to</v>

1783
01:19:04.371 --> 01:19:08.810
<v Speaker 1>do stop exact club football and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMA like that's the question.</v>

1784
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Climb Kleiman like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1785
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:13.340
<v Speaker 1>everything's got its uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its risks,</v>

1786
01:19:13.341 --> 01:19:13.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every,</v>

1787
01:19:13.911 --> 01:19:15.410
<v Speaker 1>every sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you do it like,</v>

1788
01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:17.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moderately.</v>

1789
01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:22.930
<v Speaker 1>If you do things in moderation that good</v>
<v Speaker 1>but could never be dorian yates in </v>

1790
01:19:22.930 --> 01:19:24.410
<v Speaker 1>moderation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive sports or not,</v>

1791
01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:30.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not the healthiest thing in the </v>

1792
01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:30.200
<v Speaker 1>world right now.</v>

1793
01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:30.200
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1794
01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:30.200
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1795
01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:34.651
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess there's injuries involved in </v>

1796
01:19:34.651 --> 01:19:34.651
<v Speaker 4>basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1797
01:19:34.651 --> 01:19:35.350
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

1798
01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:37.630
<v Speaker 1>you're going to lose your ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

1799
01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:40.000
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even like endurance sports,</v>

1800
01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:45.060
<v Speaker 1>a marathon run and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys die younger than incidental </v>

1801
01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.280
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1802
01:19:47.281 --> 01:19:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Because of the massive amount of free </v>
<v Speaker 1>radicals that are producing,</v>

1803
01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:56.170
<v Speaker 1>which is aging the cells from massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>free radical from all this oxygen like </v>

1804
01:19:56.531 --> 01:19:58.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

1805
01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.140
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your agent,</v>

1806
01:19:59.141 --> 01:20:04.141
<v Speaker 1>if Salads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wearing yourself out doing all </v>

1807
01:20:04.141 --> 01:20:04.141
<v Speaker 1>this interference sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1808
01:20:04.141 --> 01:20:05.290
<v Speaker 1>I think what's going to come out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

1809
01:20:05.291 --> 01:20:10.291
<v Speaker 1>and I've been doing this myself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting great results is very short </v>

1810
01:20:10.291 --> 01:20:14.500
<v Speaker 1>interval training now they've done </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies with five minutes of cardio </v>

1811
01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.020
<v Speaker 1>workout and it's getting the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>results as an hour.</v>

1812
01:20:16.150 --> 01:20:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1813
01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I do 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do what I do a 90 seconds,</v>

1814
01:20:21.541 --> 01:20:22.510
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1815
01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:25.110
<v Speaker 1>moderate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I do a 32nd all out sprint,</v>

1816
01:20:25.111 --> 01:20:28.380
<v Speaker 1>whether it's on a cross trainer or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rower or kettle bells or whatever,</v>

1817
01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.960
<v Speaker 1>get the heart rate right up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one 60 or something.</v>

1818
01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:33.570
<v Speaker 1>And then go back down to do that a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

1819
01:20:33.571 --> 01:20:38.571
<v Speaker 1>like 10 or 12 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my resting heart rate was pretty </v>

1820
01:20:38.571 --> 01:20:40.260
<v Speaker 1>good for a bodybuilder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was like 50 4:55</v>

1821
01:20:40.261 --> 01:20:43.050
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had it down to like low forties,</v>

1822
01:20:43.051 --> 01:20:48.051
<v Speaker 1>45 in the morning and that's just from </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a couple of times a week or 10 </v>

1823
01:20:48.051 --> 01:20:50.400
<v Speaker 1>minute workout and once a week I do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard bike ride,</v>

1824
01:20:50.401 --> 01:20:53.570
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely because you want to get the.</v>

1825
01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:56.130
<v Speaker 1>You want to get the benefits from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cardio exercise,</v>

1826
01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:58.620
<v Speaker 1>which is a more efficient cardiovascular</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

1827
01:20:58.950 --> 01:21:01.380
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want the negatives for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that free radical.</v>

1828
01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:04.370
<v Speaker 1>So if you can get what you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for in a 10 minute workout,</v>

1829
01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.750
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>An hour or two hours.</v>

1830
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:11.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it would be useful for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter because you're going to be in a </v>

1831
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:12.750
<v Speaker 1>ring for all that long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to condition yourself with</v>

1832
01:21:12.751 --> 01:21:14.650
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just talking about for,</v>

1833
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:17.430
<v Speaker 1>for general health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1834
01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I've never even heard of such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1835
01:21:19.381 --> 01:21:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Interval training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 10 minutes,</v>

1836
01:21:21.450 --> 01:21:26.450
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've done studies on the four and </v>

1837
01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:26.450
<v Speaker 1>five minute workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>

1838
01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the future where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1839
01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:31.830
<v Speaker 1>you want to get the benefit without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negatives.</v>

1840
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.540
<v Speaker 4>Do you think you could run a marathon </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now?</v>

1841
01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Could I run a marathon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1842
01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:36.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I running is not.</v>

1843
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Not For me now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well not definitely not for you.</v>

1844
01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:43.210
<v Speaker 1>When you're in your prime fast walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

1845
01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:45.380
<v Speaker 4>When you were in your prime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much endurance did you have?</v>

1846
01:21:45.381 --> 01:21:47.540
<v Speaker 4>Like if you had to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you had to go up a flight of stairs.</v>

1847
01:21:47.541 --> 01:21:48.500
<v Speaker 4>We like to</v>

1848
01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:53.720
<v Speaker 1>bad because I always did some cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some cardio and stretching and so </v>

1849
01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:57.140
<v Speaker 1>it was a bit unusual for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for bodybuilders because that doesn't </v>

1850
01:21:57.140 --> 01:22:00.530
<v Speaker 1>give you bigger muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I saw the other benefits of it </v>

1851
01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:03.300
<v Speaker 1>because if I got more efficient cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm training legs and back,</v>

1852
01:22:03.301 --> 01:22:08.301
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge amount of oxygen and you </v>

1853
01:22:08.301 --> 01:22:08.520
<v Speaker 1>got to failure on squats or leg presses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1854
01:22:08.521 --> 01:22:11.340
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge amount of oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me to recover from that,</v>

1855
01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I needed a bit of a cardio so I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing three or four times a week off </v>

1856
01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.940
<v Speaker 1>season every day getting ready for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>contest,</v>

1857
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:20.160
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't very intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was more like moderate.</v>

1858
01:22:20.161 --> 01:22:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I did like fast walking for an hour or </v>
<v Speaker 1>do stationary bike for 45 minutes,</v>

1859
01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:30.140
<v Speaker 1>sometimes twice a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was doing quite a lot of cardio </v>

1860
01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:32.451
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting ready for a contest rather than </v>

1861
01:22:32.451 --> 01:22:32.451
<v Speaker 1>starving myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1862
01:22:32.451 --> 01:22:36.250
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was bringing the calories down a </v>

1863
01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:36.250
<v Speaker 1>little bit and bring the activity of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

1864
01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:36.930
<v Speaker 1>So it was a bit of both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bit of calorie restriction,</v>

1865
01:22:36.931 --> 01:22:40.680
<v Speaker 1>a bit of more activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more calorie burning</v>

1866
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:44.830
<v Speaker 4>now when you do in calorie restriction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you also have to keep all that mass.</v>

1867
01:22:45.010 --> 01:22:47.740
<v Speaker 4>How did you contradictory goals?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1868
01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:49.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1869
01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:53.400
<v Speaker 1>training we can debate because I trained</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some mma guys in England,</v>

1870
01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:59.240
<v Speaker 1>a bit of Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mainly conditioning stuff and it's </v>

1871
01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.990
<v Speaker 1>fucking hard man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard training,</v>

1872
01:23:00.991 --> 01:23:05.991
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just a super hard cardio and then </v>

1873
01:23:05.991 --> 01:23:05.991
<v Speaker 1>someone's trying to punch you in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>face at the same time.</v>

1874
01:23:05.991 --> 01:23:07.450
<v Speaker 1>That's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can debate about the training.</v>

1875
01:23:07.451 --> 01:23:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Which sport is harder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1876
01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:11.400
<v Speaker 1>because I've done a little bit of both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1877
01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:14.680
<v Speaker 1>but what's harder and bodybuilding is </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you leave the gym,</v>

1878
01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:18.160
<v Speaker 1>it's still with you and when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting ready for a contest,</v>

1879
01:23:18.490 --> 01:23:22.000
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do more training and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to eat less.</v>

1880
01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:23.830
<v Speaker 1>So most sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you try,</v>

1881
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.610
<v Speaker 1>you can go train hard and then you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>go home and eat with bodybuilding,</v>

1882
01:23:26.730 --> 01:23:29.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two months before a contest,</v>

1883
01:23:29.741 --> 01:23:34.741
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hungry all the time because </v>

1884
01:23:34.741 --> 01:23:34.741
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to lose,</v>

1885
01:23:34.741 --> 01:23:36.730
<v Speaker 1>slowly lose the body fat and maintain </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle.</v>

1886
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.590
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to lose weight too </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly,</v>

1887
01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:41.440
<v Speaker 1>your body will preferentially burn a </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle because it's like,</v>

1888
01:23:42.130 --> 01:23:44.290
<v Speaker 1>what is an emergency store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1889
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Your body doesn't want to give it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to like coax it out </v>

1890
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.350
<v Speaker 1>slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1891
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1892
01:23:49.601 --> 01:23:54.601
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be hungry and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna be tired for a couple of months </v>

1893
01:23:54.601 --> 01:23:57.271
<v Speaker 1>ago for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a contest that isn't selling fun is </v>

1894
01:23:57.271 --> 01:23:57.271
<v Speaker 1>not fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1895
01:23:57.271 --> 01:24:01.830
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a constant mental battle as well </v>

1896
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:03.280
<v Speaker 1>because your body's telling you to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta eat,</v>

1897
01:24:03.281 --> 01:24:08.281
<v Speaker 1>you gotta eat and at night you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep properly because you got to sleep </v>

1898
01:24:08.281 --> 01:24:08.300
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then your body's like,</v>

1899
01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:12.850
<v Speaker 1>internal alarm clock will wake you up if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can stop and go eat and you're like,</v>

1900
01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:13.210
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

1901
01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:18.400
<v Speaker 4>I ain't doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But how do you keep your body from </v>

1902
01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:18.550
<v Speaker 4>absorbing all that muscle because you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>carrying so much muscle?</v>

1903
01:24:18.551 --> 01:24:21.200
<v Speaker 4>Is there a drug that you can take that </v>
<v Speaker 4>keeps the mass?</v>

1904
01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're taking steroids which </v>

1905
01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:26.600
<v Speaker 1>are anti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are anabolic and anti catabolic.</v>

1906
01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's going to stop you from losing </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle.</v>

1907
01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:31.080
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1908
01:24:31.081 --> 01:24:35.370
<v Speaker 1>if you restrict your calories too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>or too much exercise and none of it,</v>

1909
01:24:35.371 --> 01:24:38.550
<v Speaker 1>you still going to burn muscle is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to lower the chances of it.</v>

1910
01:24:38.730 --> 01:24:43.730
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to stack everything in your </v>

1911
01:24:43.730 --> 01:24:43.730
<v Speaker 1>favor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've taken steroids is,</v>

1912
01:24:43.730 --> 01:24:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to keep the muscle mass and stop </v>

1913
01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:48.440
<v Speaker 1>losing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you do restrict too much,</v>

1914
01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:49.680
<v Speaker 1>you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still gonna lose it.</v>

1915
01:24:49.681 --> 01:24:53.640
<v Speaker 1>So you need to like one or two pounds a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week very slowly.</v>

1916
01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Your body from going into the shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1917
01:24:56.731 --> 01:25:00.270
<v Speaker 1>That's where a lot of fighters go wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're starved themselves for a</v>

1918
01:25:00.271 --> 01:25:02.300
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks and lose muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Lou strength,</v>

1919
01:25:02.301 --> 01:25:05.640
<v Speaker 1>I lose glasses in front of muscle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they're weaker.</v>

1920
01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:06.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they fight very weak.</v>

1921
01:25:06.861 --> 01:25:11.861
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a huge issue and a lot of </v>

1922
01:25:11.861 --> 01:25:12.630
<v Speaker 4>fighters are choosing to go up a weight </v>
<v Speaker 4>class and they're having big success.</v>

1923
01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:15.450
<v Speaker 4>Donald cerrone's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great example that it's been quite a few</v>

1924
01:25:15.451 --> 01:25:16.350
<v Speaker 4>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1925
01:25:16.351 --> 01:25:18.630
<v Speaker 4>you lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You lose that weight very slowly.</v>

1926
01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:24.080
<v Speaker 4>Not Depleting it down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know what kind of diet where you want </v>

1927
01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:24.080
<v Speaker 4>when you were competing</v>

1928
01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.870
<v Speaker 1>for a high protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high protein,</v>

1929
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:28.300
<v Speaker 1>a off season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still a lot of cops,</v>

1930
01:25:28.410 --> 01:25:30.820
<v Speaker 1>major and fat and then getting ready for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a contest.</v>

1931
01:25:30.821 --> 01:25:35.821
<v Speaker 1>The cops slowly come down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was a big guy to 70 to 80.</v>

1932
01:25:37.710 --> 01:25:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I was still eating probably 3,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>calories a day,</v>

1933
01:25:42.010 --> 01:25:46.780
<v Speaker 1>which is probably more than eight now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know when you're that big you,</v>

1934
01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.440
<v Speaker 1>you're starving</v>

1935
01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.320
<v Speaker 4>because what do you weigh now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A way now to 30,</v>

1936
01:25:50.321 --> 01:25:51.700
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1937
01:25:51.701 --> 01:25:54.430
<v Speaker 4>all that extra mass needed to be fueled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1938
01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:55.870
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now what,</v>

1939
01:25:55.900 --> 01:26:00.340
<v Speaker 4>when you were in say like out of contest</v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

1940
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 4>what your goals were to put on muscle </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you would eventually</v>

1941
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:06.020
<v Speaker 2>like you would get bigger and bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>every year.</v>

1942
01:26:06.021 --> 01:26:07.050
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the things it</v>

1943
01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:12.470
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe there's certain areas </v>

1944
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:14.631
<v Speaker 1>where you want to like work on at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point that's a bit behind so you put </v>

1945
01:26:14.631 --> 01:26:18.801
<v Speaker 1>more focus on that and a bit less on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else to try and keep the </v>

1946
01:26:18.801 --> 01:26:19.170
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1947
01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:23.410
<v Speaker 1>it might sound strange now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I first competed a,</v>

1948
01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:28.460
<v Speaker 1>my first contest I lost to a guy called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed bin Aziza and his back was just</v>

1949
01:26:28.621 --> 01:26:33.621
<v Speaker 1>like freaky thick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like three d coming out and that </v>

1950
01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:33.621
<v Speaker 1>just stuck in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1951
01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:34.240
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to,</v>

1952
01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:37.260
<v Speaker 1>I put a picture of him on my fridge at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

1953
01:26:37.261 --> 01:26:41.010
<v Speaker 1>I put a picture in the gym and a funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

1954
01:26:41.011 --> 01:26:46.011
<v Speaker 1>later on in my career I became known for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy with the best back kind of </v>

1955
01:26:46.011 --> 01:26:46.560
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1956
01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:48.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1957
01:26:48.301 --> 01:26:50.100
<v Speaker 1>it was inspired by other people to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1958
01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.440
<v Speaker 1>So I worked on the back for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1959
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:57.550
<v Speaker 2>What is the difference between the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>you approach nutrition when you were </v>

1960
01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:59.120
<v Speaker 2>competing versus the way people do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>today?</v>

1961
01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Because so much changes in nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems like every five or six </v>

1962
01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.090
<v Speaker 2>years like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh nope.</v>

1963
01:27:05.091 --> 01:27:08.780
<v Speaker 2>Low fats out now you go high fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high carbs around,</v>

1964
01:27:08.781 --> 01:27:11.570
<v Speaker 2>now you go low carbs and it could change</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and forth again.</v>

1965
01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:15.480
<v Speaker 1>I think the seven is like Arnold area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frank Zane,</v>

1966
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:18.480
<v Speaker 1>they'd go more low carbs getting ready </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a contest,</v>

1967
01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:23.160
<v Speaker 1>but then you lose sizemore quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1968
01:27:23.190 --> 01:27:26.660
<v Speaker 1>why do you lose sizemore quicker that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way because you get caught that ball do,</v>

1969
01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:28.300
<v Speaker 1>you haven't got the energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1970
01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:30.810
<v Speaker 1>your body can use the amino acid from </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle for energy.</v>

1971
01:27:30.811 --> 01:27:34.380
<v Speaker 1>So there's a balance there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also you lose the glycogen storage.</v>

1972
01:27:34.770 --> 01:27:39.280
<v Speaker 1>It muscle is a 70 percent water and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water holds um,</v>

1973
01:27:39.330 --> 01:27:42.720
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates and the muscle glycogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you lose that as well.</v>

1974
01:27:42.721 --> 01:27:45.740
<v Speaker 1>So you lose that bit of volume when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>lose the glycerin,</v>

1975
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:48.360
<v Speaker 1>you lose the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So shrink down a little bit.</v>

1976
01:27:48.810 --> 01:27:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my approach was more,</v>

1977
01:27:50.770 --> 01:27:52.140
<v Speaker 1>it was high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher carbohydrates,</v>

1978
01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:58.640
<v Speaker 1>especially in the off season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting ready for a contest to cut them </v>

1979
01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:58.640
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not,</v>

1980
01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not zero and a fairly low fat.</v>

1981
01:28:01.650 --> 01:28:05.340
<v Speaker 1>I think people now realize that fats </v>
<v Speaker 1>more important and there's probably more</v>

1982
01:28:05.341 --> 01:28:08.100
<v Speaker 1>fat in the Diet than there was back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1983
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:09.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

1984
01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:14.670
<v Speaker 1>which I think is healthy fats just got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad rap and it's bullshit,</v>

1985
01:28:14.671 --> 01:28:14.910
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1986
01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1987
01:28:15.761 --> 01:28:17.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about that several times in</v>

1988
01:28:17.801 --> 01:28:22.801
<v Speaker 2>the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a New York Times article </v>

1989
01:28:22.801 --> 01:28:24.010
<v Speaker 2>recently about how the sugar industry </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid off scientists to fake results.</v>

1990
01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:29.430
<v Speaker 2>And that was done in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get the fifties or sixties and that's </v>

1991
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:30.660
<v Speaker 2>haunted people to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that fats are bad for you.</v>

1992
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:32.170
<v Speaker 2>They're essential.</v>

1993
01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I may be wrong with the organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was World Health </v>

1994
01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1995
01:28:38.611 --> 01:28:43.611
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically submitted a study that showed </v>

1996
01:28:43.611 --> 01:28:45.870
<v Speaker 1>how bad sugar was and some department of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US government,</v>

1997
01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:50.850
<v Speaker 1>which is getting a lot of money from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar lobby basically said,</v>

1998
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I think you want to reconsider this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1999
01:28:54.030 --> 01:28:58.740
<v Speaker 1>kind of like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where the whole fats are bad,</v>

2000
01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low fat came from.</v>

2001
01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:06.200
<v Speaker 1>I know back then how bad sugar is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I found it amusing when I first came </v>

2002
01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:10.050
<v Speaker 1>to the states in 1990 got all these low </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat products.</v>

2003
01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I've called my friends at homeland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How fucked up this is,</v>

2004
01:29:13.051 --> 01:29:14.640
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got low fat muffins.</v>

2005
01:29:15.210 --> 01:29:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Of course the fucking low fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're full of sugar,</v>

2006
01:29:19.410 --> 01:29:21.390
<v Speaker 1>no fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low fat yogurt,</v>

2007
01:29:21.391 --> 01:29:23.690
<v Speaker 1>low fat muffins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking full of sugar.</v>

2008
01:29:23.691 --> 01:29:25.320
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst thing you could have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2009
01:29:25.321 --> 01:29:30.321
<v Speaker 1>So people thought they were being </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy but they've been misled and it </v>

2010
01:29:30.321 --> 01:29:30.321
<v Speaker 1>makes you fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2011
01:29:30.321 --> 01:29:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with fats as long as their</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural,</v>

2012
01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:37.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get the fats in baked goods and </v>

2013
01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:37.500
<v Speaker 1>all this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that that's not good,</v>

2014
01:29:37.501 --> 01:29:42.060
<v Speaker 1>but natural fats in animal products and </v>
<v Speaker 1>coconuts and all that stuff,</v>

2015
01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:43.440
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

2016
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Now what would you use for </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates?</v>

2017
01:29:46.081 --> 01:29:51.081
<v Speaker 2>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have a preferred method or did </v>

2018
01:29:51.081 --> 01:29:51.081
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

2019
01:29:51.081 --> 01:29:51.860
<v Speaker 1>complex stuff like a oatmeal was a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2020
01:29:51.861 --> 01:29:56.570
<v Speaker 1>He was an oatmeal brown rice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet potatoes and some fruit and fiber,</v>

2021
01:29:56.690 --> 01:29:58.810
<v Speaker 1>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the main things that I use.</v>

2022
01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Basic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing fancy,</v>

2023
01:30:00.141 --> 01:30:00.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2024
01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:05.560
<v Speaker 2>did you mix your portions up and like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little tupperware boxes or something </v>

2025
01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:06.170
<v Speaker 2>like that so that you could know exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to eat.</v>

2026
01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I used to weigh my food like pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time other than nate and </v>

2027
01:30:11.290 --> 01:30:12.950
<v Speaker 1>restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very rarely and yeah,</v>

2028
01:30:13.050 --> 01:30:16.160
<v Speaker 1>I used to pack them up in boxes because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2029
01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.750
<v Speaker 1>you've got to have it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2030
01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was one of the things I did Miss</v>

2031
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Miss Mountain so relieved and I carried </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a fucking plastic boxes around with </v>

2032
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:28.220
<v Speaker 1>food and just go to a restaurant and eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever I want and have an ice cream if</v>

2033
01:30:28.221 --> 01:30:29.150
<v Speaker 1>you will do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2034
01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:33.050
<v Speaker 1>That must've been nice when you realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just just eat.</v>

2035
01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm off season wasn't too bad because </v>

2036
01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm eaten good food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of it.</v>

2037
01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:39.770
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting ready for a contest.</v>

2038
01:30:39.771 --> 01:30:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was a real mental test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2039
01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:47.500
<v Speaker 1>because your whole body is telling you </v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to eat man.</v>

2040
01:30:47.690 --> 01:30:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Even at night I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wake up,</v>

2041
01:30:49.011 --> 01:30:50.360
<v Speaker 1>you got to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2042
01:30:50.361 --> 01:30:55.361
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to eat and when to watch </v>

2043
01:30:55.361 --> 01:30:55.361
<v Speaker 1>MTV for half an hour from maybe fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to sleep a little bit,</v>

2044
01:30:55.361 --> 01:30:55.850
<v Speaker 1>hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2045
01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

2046
01:30:57.621 --> 01:31:00.770
<v Speaker 1>the Diet thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't miss that at all.</v>

2047
01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:05.800
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a tough mental challenge and I </v>

2048
01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:05.800
<v Speaker 1>did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2049
01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.590
<v Speaker 1>whenever you get through a challenge I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it makes you stronger.</v>

2050
01:31:06.591 --> 01:31:08.250
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2051
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to ever do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2052
01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:10.940
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine</v>

2053
01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:15.560
<v Speaker 2>now when you give these seminars and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>talks to these,</v>

2054
01:31:15.561 --> 01:31:17.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young bodybuilders that are coming up,</v>

2055
01:31:18.170 --> 01:31:23.170
<v Speaker 2>how do you be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of have sort of a holistic </v>

2056
01:31:23.170 --> 01:31:23.990
<v Speaker 2>approach to life down there just about </v>
<v Speaker 2>health and wellness and.</v>

2057
01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:29.500
<v Speaker 2>But when you were coaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kids are talking to these kids </v>

2058

2060
01:31:34.701 --> 01:31:39.701

<v Speaker 2>approach?</v>

<v Speaker 1>necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got all the information here that </v>

2065
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.180
<v Speaker 1>I can put across to people for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>training for the nutrition,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm not a competitive bodybuilder now.</v>

2069
01:31:59.321 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 1>My Diet and</v>

2070
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:02.620
<v Speaker 3>my training is geared towards what my </v>
<v Speaker 3>goals are,</v>

2071
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:06.550
<v Speaker 3>which is functionality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a health and wellbeing.</v>

2072
01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:08.050
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm into now.</v>

2073
01:32:08.051 --> 01:32:10.280
<v Speaker 3>That's where I'm at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a bodybuilder anymore,</v>

2074
01:32:10.630 --> 01:32:14.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2076
01:32:16.421 --> 01:32:21.421
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking get a suit from Hugo boss a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of months ago off the rack and </v>

2077
01:32:21.491 --> 01:32:26.491
<v Speaker 3>this was like so happy I could just buy </v>
<v Speaker 3>a suit off the rack before it had to </v>

2078
01:32:27.101 --> 01:32:30.080
<v Speaker 3>have it made and if it go for a fitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and go for another fitting all that.</v>

2079
01:32:30.081 --> 01:32:32.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure if they looked at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>measurements of paper,</v>

2080
01:32:32.201 --> 01:32:34.520
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the flight suit suited for?</v>

2081
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:35.410
<v Speaker 3>What is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2082
01:32:35.411 --> 01:32:38.440
<v Speaker 3>was like this wide going down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a wardrobe.</v>

2083
01:32:38.441 --> 01:32:39.580
<v Speaker 3>What is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2084
01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:41.560
<v Speaker 3>so uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2085
01:32:41.570 --> 01:32:43.060
<v Speaker 3>I look on the other side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2086
01:32:43.061 --> 01:32:46.200
<v Speaker 3>the young guys coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they think less strange like,</v>

2087
01:32:46.570 --> 01:32:49.300
<v Speaker 3>and asked me don't you dare look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>pitches back and think wow,</v>

2088
01:32:49.301 --> 01:32:49.900
<v Speaker 3>look like that.</v>

2089
01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:50.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2090
01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:53.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just look at that and I think wow,</v>

2091
01:32:53.381 --> 01:32:57.090
<v Speaker 3>that was fucking extreme and what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's craziness and credible,</v>

2092
01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:02.160
<v Speaker 3>but does it always you as far as </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition and let yourself like that.</v>

2093
01:33:02.730 --> 01:33:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes when I look at those black and</v>
<v Speaker 3>white pictures,</v>

2094
01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:08.450
<v Speaker 3>giant picture of Dorian Yates and is one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those black and white pictures man.</v>

2095
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:11.470
<v Speaker 3>And that's just like hear you saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>

2096
01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.740
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane man.</v>

2097
01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:19.330
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't really fit any more muscle </v>
<v Speaker 3>onto that frame really.</v>

2098
01:33:19.670 --> 01:33:24.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I know I went to places and I did </v>

2099
01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:25.690
<v Speaker 3>things that other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know in the gym,</v>

2100
01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:29.080
<v Speaker 3>look at your fucking forearms while my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>

2101
01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:32.110
<v Speaker 3>forums.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never did any training for forums.</v>

2102
01:33:32.111 --> 01:33:37.111
<v Speaker 3>All that was just from gripping the ball</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was doing back training mainly </v>

2103
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:42.270
<v Speaker 3>and some bicep training and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had 19 inch forums and identity to </v>

2104
01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:46.111
<v Speaker 3>a single fucking exercise for them apart</v>
<v Speaker 3>from gripping onto that is so </v>

2105
01:33:46.111 --> 01:33:50.761
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a good pitcher but is not </v>

2106
01:33:50.761 --> 01:33:50.761
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2107
01:33:50.761 --> 01:33:55.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how dare you Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull up a non Dorian because somebody </v>

2108
01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:59.350
<v Speaker 3>put it on Google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put up that winches.</v>

2109
01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Keep going to your right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2110
01:34:00.531 --> 01:34:00.850
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2111
01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:02.270
<v Speaker 3>Down what you were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2112
01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:03.520
<v Speaker 3>To right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One more.</v>

2113
01:34:03.670 --> 01:34:04.480
<v Speaker 3>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>

2114
01:34:04.481 --> 01:34:09.481
<v Speaker 3>So I trust it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's from the onstage pitcher from Mr </v>

2115
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Olympia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you can see,</v>

2116
01:34:11.171 --> 01:34:14.740
<v Speaker 3>if you look on the legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see the thinness of the skin and</v>

2117
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:17.380
<v Speaker 3>the institute with the muscle underneath</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>

2118
01:34:17.381 --> 01:34:22.381
<v Speaker 3>No fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no water between the skin layer </v>

2119
01:34:22.381 --> 01:34:22.381
<v Speaker 3>and the and the muscle layer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2120
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:25.930
<v Speaker 3>what body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what percent of body fat did you get</v>

2121
01:34:25.931 --> 01:34:27.640
<v Speaker 3>down to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2122
01:34:27.641 --> 01:34:32.641
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know because I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>skinfold calipers used to do full </v>

2123
01:34:32.641 --> 01:34:32.641
<v Speaker 3>calipers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're not accurate.</v>

2124
01:34:32.641 --> 01:34:34.480
<v Speaker 3>They used to get down to like three </v>
<v Speaker 3>point five,</v>

2125
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:38.260
<v Speaker 3>probably like a month out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I know I got leaner after that,</v>

2126
01:34:38.261 --> 01:34:43.261
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't really register because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not that accurate after that </v>

2127
01:34:43.261 --> 01:34:43.261
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know,</v>

2128
01:34:44.050 --> 01:34:46.210
<v Speaker 3>maybe three percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

2129
01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:51.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody measures your body fat is what </v>

2130
01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:51.420
<v Speaker 3>you look like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a visual thing.</v>

2131
01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:51.670
<v Speaker 3>It's really what you look like in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mirror.</v>

2132
01:34:51.671 --> 01:34:56.671
<v Speaker 3>But how did you know like how much water</v>
<v Speaker 3>to drink and when to back off and um,</v>

2133
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:58.730
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2134
01:34:58.730 --> 01:34:59.990
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2135
01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:01.220
<v Speaker 1>your fucking legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2136
01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I didn't restrict a water intake until </v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe 24 hours before the contest.</v>

2137
01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Little your right leg there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's preposterous.</v>

2138
01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge media.</v>

2139
01:35:10.991 --> 01:35:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Alice right over the knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2140
01:35:15.630 --> 01:35:17.540
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of sick work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2141
01:35:17.541 --> 01:35:22.541
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like I used to try and legs </v>

2142
01:35:22.541 --> 01:35:26.890
<v Speaker 1>pretty much once a week and for four or </v>
<v Speaker 1>five days of every week I had trouble </v>

2143
01:35:28.311 --> 01:35:31.280
<v Speaker 1>sitting on the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trouble moving around.</v>

2144
01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean if I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be happy,</v>

2145
01:35:32.991 --> 01:35:34.700
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a field that fucking pain,</v>

2146
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.460
<v Speaker 1>pain in the ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain in the leg just to sit down.</v>

2147
01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.130
<v Speaker 1>But hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfying because you know,</v>

2148
01:35:40.131 --> 01:35:45.131
<v Speaker 1>you fucking done some damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it's like that and the damage </v>

2149
01:35:45.131 --> 01:35:47.690
<v Speaker 1>repairs itself to get slightly bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stronger bodybuilders,</v>

2150
01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.080
<v Speaker 1>just an adaptation to stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2151
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:52.220
<v Speaker 1>you put a certain stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's going to adapt to it.</v>

2152
01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to get bigger and stronger so I </v>

2153
01:35:57.250 --> 01:35:57.860
<v Speaker 1>can handle this stress next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's basically what it is.</v>

2154
01:35:57.861 --> 01:36:02.180
<v Speaker 1>So continually trying to stress yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>like anything you want to get better.</v>

2155
01:36:02.190 --> 01:36:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Katia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to express your cardio system so it </v>

2156
01:36:07.190 --> 01:36:07.190
<v Speaker 1>adapts.</v>

2157
01:36:07.190 --> 01:36:07.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no other way,</v>

2158
01:36:07.190 --> 01:36:07.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To get that big.</v>

2159
01:36:07.511 --> 01:36:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no shortcuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing you can do.</v>

2160
01:36:09.761 --> 01:36:11.110
<v Speaker 2>There's no easy route.</v>

2161
01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2162
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:17.590
<v Speaker 1>It looks like guys are looking for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy route now because I don't see them </v>

2163
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:20.261
<v Speaker 1>train that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you don't see the quality of </v>

2164
01:36:20.261 --> 01:36:23.521
<v Speaker 1>their physiques the guys a big now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you look at the quality is not the </v>

2165
01:36:23.521 --> 01:36:23.521
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same.</v>

2166
01:36:23.521 --> 01:36:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you just generally accepted in </v>

2167
01:36:27.370 --> 01:36:29.321
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding in the nineties was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>peak of competitive physiques as far as </v>

2168
01:36:30.141 --> 01:36:31.820
<v Speaker 1>the standard and the depth of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard.</v>

2169
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:36.740
<v Speaker 1>There was like six to eight guys on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage that were like really,</v>

2170
01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.210
<v Speaker 1>like if you are off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2171
01:36:38.211 --> 01:36:41.060
<v Speaker 1>there's places could change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got one guy,</v>

2172
01:36:41.061 --> 01:36:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Phil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phil Heath,</v>

2173
01:36:42.171 --> 01:36:47.171
<v Speaker 1>who was the Mr Olympia and it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>like distance between him and the next </v>

2174
01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:48.050
<v Speaker 1>few guys.</v>

2175
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:53.590
<v Speaker 2>Now what is it though that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>open the door for a current modern day?</v>

2176
01:36:54.471 --> 01:36:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Dorian Yates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some super dedicated person.</v>

2177
01:36:57.241 --> 01:36:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Me physiologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can still do the same things that</v>

2178
01:36:59.501 --> 01:36:59.960
<v Speaker 2>you did.</v>

2179
01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2180
01:37:03.130 --> 01:37:08.130
<v Speaker 1>things have changed since the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot more avenues that people </v>

2181
01:37:08.130 --> 01:37:10.630
<v Speaker 1>could choose to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like doing a sport or in,</v>

2182
01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:15.720
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC that doesn't exist in the early </v>

2183
01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:16.110
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching the first show on a.</v>

2184
01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.570
<v Speaker 1>It was in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched on TV the first,</v>

2185
01:37:18.610 --> 01:37:19.570
<v Speaker 1>the very first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2186
01:37:19.571 --> 01:37:20.080
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2187
01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:22.210
<v Speaker 1>always crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got,</v>

2188
01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:25.540
<v Speaker 1>you've got mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got crossfit and it got all these</v>

2189
01:37:25.541 --> 01:37:29.740
<v Speaker 1>other competitions now in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the bodybuilding arena,</v>

2190
01:37:29.741 --> 01:37:32.170
<v Speaker 1>that's not bodybuilding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's men's physique,</v>

2191
01:37:32.171 --> 01:37:35.050
<v Speaker 1>whether we're the board shorts and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>got the nice physique and abdominals,</v>

2192
01:37:35.051 --> 01:37:37.720
<v Speaker 1>that kind of physique that most people </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspire to have.</v>

2193
01:37:37.721 --> 01:37:39.100
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

2194
01:37:39.101 --> 01:37:44.101
<v Speaker 1>you've got classic bodybuilding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so got a lot of different avenues and I </v>

2195
01:37:44.101 --> 01:37:48.031
<v Speaker 1>think the interest in pure bodybuilding </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a lot less than I made in the </v>

2196
01:37:48.031 --> 01:37:49.540
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wanted to be a bodybuilder.</v>

2197
01:37:49.541 --> 01:37:51.430
<v Speaker 1>It was like hugely popular.</v>

2198
01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:53.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting now,</v>

2199
01:37:53.201 --> 01:37:54.640
<v Speaker 2>what is this Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you pull it up here?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Coleman on the end who became a an eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>time Mr Olympia</v>

2203
01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:08.780
<v Speaker 3>guys are on Jack also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard to tell them like,</v>

2204
01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:10.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2205
01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:15.460

01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:18.030
<v Speaker 3>best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2207
01:38:18.031 --> 01:38:23.031
<v Speaker 3>it's also got to be hard for that tiny </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude that's next to you decided to do </v>

2208
01:38:23.730 --> 01:38:28.730
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always been unhappy because it got </v>

2209
01:38:28.730 --> 01:38:29.220
<v Speaker 3>been by me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a thing as he had a great physique,</v>

2210
01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:31.110
<v Speaker 3>just like frank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zane had a great physique,</v>

2211
01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he was the same size as arnold,</v>

2212
01:38:34.530 --> 01:38:39.530
<v Speaker 3>maybe it would have beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't in the same size as </v>

2213
01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:39.790
<v Speaker 3>arnold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And same goes with a gentleman up there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was twice as big.</v>

2216
01:38:44.101 --> 01:38:47.130
<v Speaker 3>So big guy always beats a good little </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

2217
01:38:47.131 --> 01:38:48.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Now what about the top guys today?</v>

2219
01:38:53.011 --> 01:38:58.011
<v Speaker 3>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sean Heath is the number one guy to </v>

2220
01:38:58.011 --> 01:38:58.011
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phil.</v>

2221
01:38:58.011 --> 01:38:58.011
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

2222
01:38:58.011 --> 01:39:00.420
<v Speaker 3>Now there's so many different avenues </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and a lot of them,</v>

2223
01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:05.520
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people are going towards like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet route because you can make </v>

2224
01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:09.141
<v Speaker 3>a lot of money as like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an internet like famous person for being</v>

2225
01:39:09.511 --> 01:39:13.200
<v Speaker 3>a bodybuilder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you selling things and selling.</v>

2226
01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:16.230
<v Speaker 3>There he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phil Heath pretty jacked.</v>

2227
01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:18.950
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phil Heath is,</v>

2228
01:39:18.970 --> 01:39:21.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not very wide in the shoulders,</v>

2229
01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:26.010
<v Speaker 3>a weak point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but has got huge,</v>

2230
01:39:26.050 --> 01:39:31.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long muscle bellies on the most of his </v>

2231
01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:32.710
<v Speaker 1>body as his pecs are not great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the rest,</v>

2232
01:39:32.770 --> 01:39:33.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2233
01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:37.050
<v Speaker 3>the rest is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really have any weak points,</v>

2234
01:39:37.051 --> 01:39:42.051
<v Speaker 3>so that's why he's is ahead of everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>else and you just think there's just </v>

2235
01:39:42.051 --> 01:39:43.310
<v Speaker 3>less people doing it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's less</v>

2236
01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:48.340
<v Speaker 1>people go into to competitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilder because there's a lot more </v>

2237
01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:51.071
<v Speaker 1>avenues and I think it's less popular </v>
<v Speaker 1>now because it's almost like peeked out </v>

2238
01:39:51.071 --> 01:39:53.120
<v Speaker 1>with myself and run in and gone down a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

2239
01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:55.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know,</v>

2240
01:39:56.070 --> 01:40:01.070
<v Speaker 1>how do you surpass it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to a peak and guys are trying to do </v>

2241
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:02.180
<v Speaker 1>that so that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2242
01:40:02.181 --> 01:40:04.310
<v Speaker 1>that they're trying to get big and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting big,</v>

2243
01:40:04.311 --> 01:40:06.470
<v Speaker 1>but they're getting big with a big waste</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything as well.</v>

2244
01:40:06.471 --> 01:40:11.471
<v Speaker 1>So it's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same look as not the same </v>

2245
01:40:11.471 --> 01:40:11.471
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>

2246
01:40:11.471 --> 01:40:11.960
<v Speaker 3>That's got to be super dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

2247
01:40:11.961 --> 01:40:14.720
<v Speaker 3>When you see those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are enormous bloated bellies.</v>

2248
01:40:14.850 --> 01:40:16.550
<v Speaker 3>That's a huge debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the like,</v>

2249
01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:18.380
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

2250
01:40:19.730 --> 01:40:21.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>internal organs that are</v>

2251
01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.370
<v Speaker 1>initially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2252
01:40:24.371 --> 01:40:25.720
<v Speaker 1>that's what people thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2253
01:40:26.230 --> 01:40:28.200
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2254
01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:30.610
<v Speaker 1>my wife started getting little bloated </v>
<v Speaker 1>around 96,</v>

2255
01:40:30.611 --> 01:40:35.611
<v Speaker 1>97,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe [inaudible] 97 when I was using </v>

2256
01:40:35.611 --> 01:40:35.611
<v Speaker 1>insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2257
01:40:35.611 --> 01:40:36.820
<v Speaker 1>You got a little bloated and load </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard.</v>

2258
01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I retired it went down and I </v>

2259
01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:42.430
<v Speaker 1>actually in England because I was always</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2260
01:40:42.450 --> 01:40:47.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking steroids for this sport </v>

2261
01:40:47.450 --> 01:40:47.450
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a professional when I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>competing,</v>

2262
01:40:47.450 --> 01:40:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to take them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stop taking them.</v>

2263
01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:52.110
<v Speaker 1>And also I took growth hormone and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the thing.</v>

2264
01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:57.300
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people think hormone is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to increase the size of internal organs </v>

2265
01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:58.240
<v Speaker 1>and that's why guys are getting bloated </v>
<v Speaker 1>waistline.</v>

2266
01:40:58.950 --> 01:41:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I went and had a real,</v>

2267
01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:06.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean a battery of tests where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually measure all your internal </v>

2268
01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:09.340
<v Speaker 1>organs and mine all totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apart from my heart was a bit bigger and</v>

2269
01:41:09.341 --> 01:41:11.490
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just normal athletic hot.</v>

2270
01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that wasn't the case.</v>

2271
01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:19.860
<v Speaker 1>So I perhaps it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fat this building up around the </v>

2272
01:41:20.591 --> 01:41:25.591
<v Speaker 1>internal organs or maybe it's just a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of water in the intestines and it just </v>

2273
01:41:25.591 --> 01:41:29.380
<v Speaker 1>blows to the waste out of the short </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer is the short answer is I don't </v>

2274
01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:31.450
<v Speaker 1>really know who's that guy in the far </v>
<v Speaker 1>left a.</v>

2275
01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:33.160
<v Speaker 1>that's like a turtle shell.</v>

2276
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:35.720
<v Speaker 4>There's not really a turtle shell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2277
01:41:35.930 --> 01:41:38.870
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that could be insulin.</v>

2278
01:41:38.871 --> 01:41:39.290
<v Speaker 4>That can be.</v>

2279
01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:45.820
<v Speaker 1>We only seen this kind of thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening since the guys are using </v>

2280
01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:47.780
<v Speaker 1>insulin and igf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is insulin like growth factor.</v>

2281
01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2282
01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:51.270
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good look.</v>

2283
01:41:51.271 --> 01:41:52.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2284
01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:54.590
<v Speaker 1>a turtle show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2285
01:41:54.591 --> 01:41:56.260
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It literally looks like.</v>

2286
01:41:56.261 --> 01:41:59.580
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the guys that got big but </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere systemic,</v>

2287
01:41:59.581 --> 01:42:00.710
<v Speaker 1>like growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2288
01:42:00.711 --> 01:42:02.260
<v Speaker 1>when you're training with weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2289
01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:07.280
<v Speaker 1>your major muscles are going to grow but</v>
<v Speaker 1>not around the waist can thicken a </v>

2290
01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:07.430
<v Speaker 1>little bit but not that much.</v>

2291
01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:10.560
<v Speaker 4>Now when you got off of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you retired,</v>

2292
01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.240
<v Speaker 4>what was the crash like?</v>

2293
01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't something I was ready for.</v>

2294
01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:18.330
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of things going in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a divorce,</v>

2295
01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody close to me pass away and um,</v>

2296
01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:25.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retiring,</v>

2297
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:30.470
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say a death in the family or </v>

2298
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:32.631
<v Speaker 1>divorce or retirement is like a major </v>
<v Speaker 1>stressful event or how about an old </v>

2299
01:42:32.631 --> 01:42:36.060
<v Speaker 1>fucking three at the same time while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not while you're coming down from</v>

2300
01:42:36.061 --> 01:42:37.890
<v Speaker 1>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2301
01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:40.800
<v Speaker 1>I definitely suffered from depression </v>
<v Speaker 1>and anxiety.</v>

2302
01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why do I feel like this?</v>

2303
01:42:43.861 --> 01:42:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even like now I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2304
01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Because you fucking stopped cold Turkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm extreme unlike I'm using </v>

2305
01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:56.091
<v Speaker 1>them because I'm doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stopped now and stop and I had no </v>

2306
01:42:56.091 --> 01:43:00.231
<v Speaker 1>real help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no real like this guy is now </v>

2307
01:43:00.231 --> 01:43:00.260
<v Speaker 1>and especially in the states that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2308
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:04.710
<v Speaker 1>they specialized in patients that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>using steroids and all the possible side</v>

2309
01:43:04.711 --> 01:43:06.450
<v Speaker 1>effects and coming off and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2310
01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:11.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really have any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just went cold Turkey and after </v>

2311
01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:16.341
<v Speaker 1>about two years my normal testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>was still not coming into the normal.</v>

2312
01:43:17.371 --> 01:43:19.440
<v Speaker 1>So then I went on the replacement </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy,</v>

2313
01:43:19.441 --> 01:43:22.920
<v Speaker 1>which is like twice a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a testosterone replacement,</v>

2314
01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:25.170
<v Speaker 1>and then I felt normal again.</v>

2315
01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:27.950
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the come down like you,</v>

2316
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:33.010
<v Speaker 4>you're taking this work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What were you taking like right before </v>

2317
01:43:33.010 --> 01:43:33.010
<v Speaker 4>he stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what was the,</v>

2318
01:43:33.010 --> 01:43:37.840
<v Speaker 4>do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably about a thousand milligrams a </v>

2319
01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:38.420
<v Speaker 4>week total of testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a total of every.</v>

2320
01:43:38.930 --> 01:43:40.550
<v Speaker 4>All kinds of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Deep on everything.</v>

2321
01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:43.960
<v Speaker 4>But if testosterone but have a deck or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that and then</v>

2322
01:43:45.110 --> 01:43:46.880
<v Speaker 1>then stop and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2323
01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.970
<v Speaker 4>was it a gradual effect where your </v>
<v Speaker 4>body's freaking out or was it like</v>

2324
01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:53.270
<v Speaker 1>almost instantaneous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2325
01:43:53.530 --> 01:43:58.530
<v Speaker 1>it was probably after a few months I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started like noticing I wasn't feeling </v>

2326
01:43:58.530 --> 01:43:59.710
<v Speaker 1>too good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funnily enough,</v>

2327
01:43:59.711 --> 01:44:04.711
<v Speaker 1>like sex drive didn't totally disappear </v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually had my daughter was </v>

2328
01:44:05.831 --> 01:44:10.831
<v Speaker 1>conceived while I was not on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think they did trials with </v>

2329
01:44:10.831 --> 01:44:15.151
<v Speaker 1>testosterone as a male contraceptive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was moderately effective but not </v>

2330
01:44:15.161 --> 01:44:17.080
<v Speaker 1>enough that they would market it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2331
01:44:17.650 --> 01:44:19.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2332
01:44:19.331 --> 01:44:22.090
<v Speaker 1>probably like six to nine months it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really not,</v>

2333
01:44:22.270 --> 01:44:25.120
<v Speaker 1>not feeling good at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2334
01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:28.450
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of factors there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was still taking steroids,</v>

2335
01:44:28.451 --> 01:44:32.080
<v Speaker 1>but those things happened in my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have felt as bad,</v>

2336
01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:33.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not,</v>

2337
01:44:33.701 --> 01:44:38.701
<v Speaker 1>but there were definitely a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic stuff going on at the same </v>

2338
01:44:38.701 --> 01:44:38.701
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2339
01:44:38.701 --> 01:44:39.070
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was there any conventional wisdom in the</v>

2340
01:44:39.071 --> 01:44:44.071
<v Speaker 4>bodybuilding community of how to slowly </v>
<v Speaker 4>cycle off or what the factors would be </v>

2341
01:44:44.801 --> 01:44:46.750
<v Speaker 4>and how you could mitigate them?</v>

2342
01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Not at that time now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty years on.</v>

2343
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:54.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go on the Internet and find a </v>

2344
01:44:54.270 --> 01:44:54.270
<v Speaker 1>ton of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2345
01:44:54.270 --> 01:44:57.290
<v Speaker 1>but not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the only thing is guys were using </v>

2346
01:44:57.290 --> 01:45:00.091
<v Speaker 1>was atg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like helps to Cheryl and </v>

2347
01:45:00.091 --> 01:45:00.091
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clomid,</v>

2348
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:03.480
<v Speaker 1>clomid and some natural stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2349
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I remember going to an endocrinologist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and asking him like,</v>

2350
01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:09.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what she'll do is she'll do acg and this</v>

2351
01:45:09.221 --> 01:45:10.000
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

2352
01:45:10.001 --> 01:45:10.750
<v Speaker 1>look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

2353
01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:12.850
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dorian,</v>

2354
01:45:13.330 --> 01:45:15.640
<v Speaker 1>you probably know more than me about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2355
01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:18.880
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

2356
01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:21.370
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about this situation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody coming off steroids,</v>

2357
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:22.480
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have a clue,</v>

2358
01:45:22.481 --> 01:45:22.900
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2359
01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:26.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now you've got guys out there,</v>

2360
01:45:26.201 --> 01:45:31.201
<v Speaker 1>they'd have a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a seminar and I'm in Canada and </v>

2361
01:45:32.110 --> 01:45:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Ben Johnson was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the guy that Olympic gold </v>

2362
01:45:37.110 --> 01:45:39.571
<v Speaker 1>medalist for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was there with his doctor and has a </v>

2363
01:45:39.571 --> 01:45:43.401
<v Speaker 1>couple of other doctors there and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctors told me that absolutely </v>

2364
01:45:43.401 --> 01:45:47.260
<v Speaker 1>every guy that was in the hundred meters</v>
<v Speaker 1>race tested positive every guy.</v>

2365
01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was CBS was covering the </v>

2366
01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:52.920
<v Speaker 1>contest and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't fucking,</v>

2367
01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of have every guy like,</v>

2368
01:45:55.090 --> 01:46:00.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to choose one and make sure </v>

2369
01:46:00.090 --> 01:46:00.090
<v Speaker 1>he's not American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

2370
01:46:00.090 --> 01:46:01.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the story they told me and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that man,</v>

2371
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:06.790
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely some real good </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence that they're all doing </v>

2372
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.790
<v Speaker 4>something</v>

2373
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:08.610
<v Speaker 1>goat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt felt bad for him and he was like,</v>

2374
01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:10.950
<v Speaker 1>fucking demonized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember all the newspapers.</v>

2375
01:46:11.670 --> 01:46:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I remember my son went to school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they did a whole thing at school about,</v>

2376
01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:17.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it came home.</v>

2377
01:46:17.641 --> 01:46:19.500
<v Speaker 1>He must have fucking known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Dad was jacked up.</v>

2378
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2379
01:46:22.130 --> 01:46:27.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was cheating and you shouldn't </v>

2380
01:46:27.130 --> 01:46:27.130
<v Speaker 1>do that and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They told him at school and I was like,</v>

2381
01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:32.960
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so not explained to you when you have </v>

2382
01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:32.960
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2383
01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:33.770
<v Speaker 4>and he also had no recourse like Lance </v>
<v Speaker 4>Armstrong today as a podcast.</v>

2384
01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:37.990
<v Speaker 4>He's done a bunch of interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can tell his story and now you know,</v>

2385
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:41.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think there was a period of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time where lance was demonized,</v>

2386
01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:47.080
<v Speaker 4>but over time that is greatly subsided </v>
<v Speaker 4>and people now recognize,</v>

2387
01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:52.601
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he literally was in a sport where </v>

2388
01:46:52.601 --> 01:46:53.400
<v Speaker 4>everyone was cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But is that cheating?</v>

2389
01:46:53.610 --> 01:46:55.380
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if everyone's doing it,</v>

2390
01:46:55.381 --> 01:47:00.381
<v Speaker 4>is it cheaper?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the real issue I think was </v>

2391
01:47:00.381 --> 01:47:02.220
<v Speaker 4>deception and lawsuits and saying that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't do it in suing people who said</v>

2392
01:47:02.221 --> 01:47:06.180
<v Speaker 4>he did and there was a lot of stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't exactly the smartest thing to do,</v>

2393
01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:11.480
<v Speaker 4>but you're dealing with a cornered </v>
<v Speaker 4>person who's a super competitive alpha </v>

2394
01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:15.570
<v Speaker 4>male trying to figure his way out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this mess that he's found himself in and</v>

2395
01:47:15.571 --> 01:47:20.250
<v Speaker 4>this mass that exists systematically or </v>
<v Speaker 4>systemically in this entire industry.</v>

2396
01:47:20.251 --> 01:47:21.690
<v Speaker 4>The entire sport that he's involved.</v>

2397
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the um,</v>

2398
01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:28.960
<v Speaker 1>there was a car that got stopped in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>board or a few years ago and the Tour de</v>

2399
01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:29.680
<v Speaker 1>France is going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2400
01:47:30.010 --> 01:47:31.840
<v Speaker 1>France to someone across the border </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

2401
01:47:32.290 --> 01:47:34.530
<v Speaker 1>and it was a team call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2402
01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:39.540
<v Speaker 1>And they stopped the team car and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just full of apo and steroids and all </v>

2403
01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:39.540
<v Speaker 1>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2404
01:47:39.610 --> 01:47:42.220
<v Speaker 1>So it's how well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2405
01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:44.380
<v Speaker 1>when was the first Tour de France?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2406
01:47:44.381 --> 01:47:47.110
<v Speaker 1>but I know environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the very early ones,</v>

2407
01:47:47.730 --> 01:47:49.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2408
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:54.510
<v Speaker 1>the guy that was winning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he died because it was using </v>

2409
01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:54.510
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines let back in whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2410
01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:54.760
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

2411
01:47:54.761 --> 01:47:56.530
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 or something like that.</v>

2412
01:47:56.531 --> 01:47:58.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2413
01:47:59.010 --> 01:48:00.700
<v Speaker 1>it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the sport.</v>

2414
01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:05.740
<v Speaker 1>When I came into bodybuilding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I invented steroids with </v>

2415
01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:05.740
<v Speaker 1>already there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2416
01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:10.410
<v Speaker 1>my first Mister Olympia is in 1965.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry Scott was the Mr Olympia and 90 </v>

2417
01:48:10.410 --> 01:48:10.690
<v Speaker 1>65.</v>

2418
01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:13.600
<v Speaker 1>And he said he was using steroids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was 1965.</v>

2419
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:16.120
<v Speaker 1>So when did this start being used?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2420
01:48:16.121 --> 01:48:19.390
<v Speaker 1>but for sure in the early sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1965,</v>

2421
01:48:19.391 --> 01:48:21.310
<v Speaker 1>they had steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did they invent steroids?</v>

2422
01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

2423
01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:24.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had testosterone.</v>

2424
01:48:25.450 --> 01:48:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Testosterone was used in the Second </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War.</v>

2425
01:48:27.461 --> 01:48:30.670
<v Speaker 1>The Germans were using that with the SS </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers.</v>

2426
01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so injectable testosterone was available</v>

2427
01:48:34.751 --> 01:48:39.751
<v Speaker 1>then steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are more refined version of </v>

2428
01:48:39.751 --> 01:48:39.751
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2429
01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I think late fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is it more refined in what way?</v>

2430
01:48:43.570 --> 01:48:45.520
<v Speaker 1>So you got testosterone is a male </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone,</v>

2431
01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.760
<v Speaker 1>so it's basically 50 percent androgenic </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's male,</v>

2432
01:48:48.761 --> 01:48:52.780
<v Speaker 1>like characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 percent anabolic repair build.</v>

2433
01:48:53.650 --> 01:48:58.650
<v Speaker 1>So they want it to take this and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to this pot the anabolic and </v>

2434
01:48:58.871 --> 01:49:02.050
<v Speaker 1>minimize the androgenic because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what gives you side effects,</v>

2435
01:49:02.290 --> 01:49:05.890
<v Speaker 1>prostate growth and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they try,</v>

2436
01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:10.920
<v Speaker 1>they refined it so that those effects </v>
<v Speaker 1>are minimized and more of the anabolic </v>

2437
01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:10.920
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

2438
01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:15.570
<v Speaker 1>That was the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a guy called John Stigler I </v>

2439
01:49:15.570 --> 01:49:19.171
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because they found out the eastern </v>

2440
01:49:19.171 --> 01:49:22.921
<v Speaker 1>bloc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had their own at their own stuff </v>

2441
01:49:22.921 --> 01:49:23.830
<v Speaker 1>called to rentable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a siegler invented,</v>

2442
01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:25.810
<v Speaker 1>definable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know,</v>

2443
01:49:25.811 --> 01:49:29.110
<v Speaker 1>don't quote me if I could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was about 58 or something</v>

2444
01:49:29.111 --> 01:49:30.460
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He developed that for us.</v>

2445
01:49:30.461 --> 01:49:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Weightlifting team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1958,</v>

2446
01:49:33.041 --> 01:49:35.560
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 58 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before that you had testosterone,</v>

2447
01:49:35.561 --> 01:49:39.040
<v Speaker 1>so who knows what a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people started using it,</v>

2448
01:49:39.041 --> 01:49:44.041
<v Speaker 1>but for sure from the early sixties it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a part of bodybuilding and then </v>

2449
01:49:44.041 --> 01:49:48.900
<v Speaker 1>other sports and they used to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disclaimer inside the steroid thing </v>

2450
01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:53.680
<v Speaker 1>saying anabolic steroids do not increase</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletic performance.</v>

2451
01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:54.880
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2452
01:49:54.910 --> 01:49:57.970
<v Speaker 1>So they stated this and they also told </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys if you take this,</v>

2453
01:49:58.030 --> 01:50:00.040
<v Speaker 1>your fucking balls are going to drop </v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

2454
01:50:00.041 --> 01:50:01.120
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fucking die.</v>

2455
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:06.390
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get liver cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So guys started using them and seeing </v>

2456
01:50:06.581 --> 01:50:07.900
<v Speaker 1>that that's all bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2457
01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:10.320
<v Speaker 1>So then they don't want to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2458
01:50:10.350 --> 01:50:12.760
<v Speaker 1>These medical guys you've got to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're aligned to us then.</v>

2459
01:50:13.150 --> 01:50:15.430
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to be lying to us all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

2460
01:50:15.431 --> 01:50:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2461
01:50:16.451 --> 01:50:21.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you do have chances of side </v>

2462
01:50:21.451 --> 01:50:23.701
<v Speaker 1>effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you could say it's been greatly </v>

2463
01:50:23.701 --> 01:50:25.810
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated and certain propaganda and </v>
<v Speaker 1>deception,</v>

2464
01:50:25.811 --> 01:50:26.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2465
01:50:26.630 --> 01:50:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Just tell the fucking truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2466
01:50:28.391 --> 01:50:30.080
<v Speaker 1>and let them deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2467
01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:35.400
<v Speaker 1>that's what I do because I saw all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff on the Internet about what I'm </v>

2468
01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:40.350
<v Speaker 1>supposedly doing and I thought young </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys are going to read this and maybe </v>

2469
01:50:40.350 --> 01:50:41.740
<v Speaker 1>they're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did an article in a magazine,</v>

2470
01:50:41.741 --> 01:50:43.060
<v Speaker 1>muscular development and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

2471
01:50:43.090 --> 01:50:46.110
<v Speaker 1>this is what I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I did in officer,</v>

2472
01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:50.100
<v Speaker 1>this is what a different context and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these are my opinions and you know,</v>

2473
01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:55.560
<v Speaker 1>my honest opinion is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's worth it unless you </v>

2474
01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:55.560
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're competing and so on.</v>

2475
01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:58.020
<v Speaker 1>But ultimately it's up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you the information.</v>

2476
01:50:58.030 --> 01:51:03.030
<v Speaker 1>What you do is up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if 70 percent of the </v>

2477
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.610
<v Speaker 1>people like this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't really,</v>

2478
01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:06.160
<v Speaker 1>you must have talked much more than this</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm taking this.</v>

2479
01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Actually I'm taking more than this and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>will look like,</v>

2480
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:10.360
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough shit man.</v>

2481
01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:15.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of guys that take more </v>

2482
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:19.141
<v Speaker 1>stuff than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I couldn't even compete in a </v>

2483
01:51:19.141 --> 01:51:19.141
<v Speaker 1>contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even good enough.</v>

2484
01:51:19.141 --> 01:51:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Is there a certain amount where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't help you?</v>

2485
01:51:20.770 --> 01:51:23.830
<v Speaker 1>I think it gets to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cup is full,</v>

2486
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:24.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2487
01:51:25.090 --> 01:51:28.240
<v Speaker 1>it's just a matter of hard work is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cup is fallen more than that.</v>

2488
01:51:28.241 --> 01:51:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that going to help you anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to increase your chances</v>

2489
01:51:31.661 --> 01:51:34.010
<v Speaker 1>of negative effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2490
01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:36.430
<v Speaker 1>so when I was an amateur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might,</v>

2491
01:51:36.490 --> 01:51:41.490
<v Speaker 1>my policy was always take as little as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible to get the maximum effect and </v>

2492
01:51:41.490 --> 01:51:43.690
<v Speaker 1>when that's not working then you can go </v>
<v Speaker 1>up a little bit more,</v>

2493
01:51:43.770 --> 01:51:44.100
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2494
01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you go a day one and just </v>

2495
01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:49.990
<v Speaker 1>throwing everything in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body's going to get used to that way</v>

2496
01:51:49.991 --> 01:51:51.970
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where would you get steroids?</v>

2497
01:51:52.570 --> 01:51:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

2498
01:51:53.351 --> 01:51:57.460
<v Speaker 1>where did I used to get them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I got them in in UK was just</v>

2499
01:51:57.461 --> 01:52:02.461
<v Speaker 1>from the gym when I first started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people were bringing them in,</v>

2500
01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:04.840
<v Speaker 1>trucks loads full from Europe and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was not,</v>

2501
01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:07.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the authorities are not even aware of it</v>

2502
01:52:07.901 --> 01:52:11.350
<v Speaker 1>or concerned about it or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the policy,</v>

2503
01:52:11.530 --> 01:52:16.530
<v Speaker 1>at least in a UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it depends on every country in </v>

2504
01:52:16.530 --> 01:52:20.761
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in uk it's perfectly legal to have </v>

2505
01:52:20.761 --> 01:52:22.750
<v Speaker 1>steroids for your own use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you going to be driving your car with</v>

2506
01:52:22.751 --> 01:52:27.751
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of steroids on the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>passenger seat and the police call you </v>

2507
01:52:27.751 --> 01:52:27.751
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's this?</v>

2508
01:52:27.751 --> 01:52:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Isn't my steroids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2509
01:52:29.110 --> 01:52:34.110
<v Speaker 1>For Your own personal use is selling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making money and not paying your taxes.</v>

2510
01:52:35.170 --> 01:52:36.670
<v Speaker 1>That's all they care about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2511
01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's I think how it should be.</v>

2512
01:52:38.290 --> 01:52:39.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as his education,</v>

2513
01:52:39.731 --> 01:52:44.731
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're not lying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is when you lie to </v>

2514
01:52:44.731 --> 01:52:47.521
<v Speaker 1>people about the effects of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they think you lied to them about </v>

2515
01:52:47.521 --> 01:52:47.521
<v Speaker 1>pain pills.</v>

2516
01:52:47.521 --> 01:52:48.800
<v Speaker 2>You're find about all sorts of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that is actually deadly.</v>

2517
01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I think all fucking drugs should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal and it should put money into </v>

2518
01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:58.751
<v Speaker 1>education and treatment and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they did in Portugal and the fucking </v>

2519
01:52:59.130 --> 01:53:00.560
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Write down,</v>

2520
01:53:00.810 --> 01:53:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Glenn Greenwald actually post something </v>
<v Speaker 2>today about that.</v>

2521
01:53:03.571 --> 01:53:08.571
<v Speaker 2>Showing how it's changed over time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten actually better since they have </v>

2522
01:53:08.761 --> 01:53:11.250
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in particular marijuana since</v>

2523
01:53:11.251 --> 01:53:16.251
<v Speaker 2>they've made marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Legal and started legalizing drugs and </v>

2524
01:53:16.251 --> 01:53:20.250
<v Speaker 2>in Portugal they've had far less </v>
<v Speaker 2>incidences of people having like real </v>

2525
01:53:20.461 --> 01:53:20.950
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>

2526
01:53:21.070 --> 01:53:26.070
<v Speaker 1>so literally and the money they use it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to reeducate people and get them out of </v>

2527
01:53:26.651 --> 01:53:28.770
<v Speaker 1>that cycle and try and get them back </v>
<v Speaker 1>into society to,</v>

2528
01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:33.840
<v Speaker 1>to get them a job and all that stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just going to punish people for doing </v>

2529
01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:37.291
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck they ever going to get </v>

2530
01:53:37.291 --> 01:53:37.291
<v Speaker 1>better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2531
01:53:37.291 --> 01:53:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Well there's also a problem with telling</v>
<v Speaker 2>people not to do something and they want</v>

2532
01:53:38.181 --> 01:53:38.670
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

2533
01:53:39.970 --> 01:53:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a label.</v>

2534
01:53:42.131 --> 01:53:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me do it.</v>

2535
01:53:44.110 --> 01:53:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can fucking have it if you want,</v>

2536
01:53:45.851 --> 01:53:48.700
<v Speaker 1>but this is all the negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

2537
01:53:48.701 --> 01:53:51.790
<v Speaker 1>And what do you want to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are choosing</v>

2538
01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:53.290
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bodybuilders.</v>

2539
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Bodybuilders that died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2540
01:53:55.480 --> 01:54:00.480
<v Speaker 2>did any of them die from steroids or did</v>
<v Speaker 2>they die from complications involving a </v>

2541
01:54:01.031 --> 01:54:02.200
<v Speaker 2>host of different issues?</v>

2542
01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hard to say because there's been </v>

2543
01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:11.331
<v Speaker 1>quite a few of bodybuilders and mainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>male and mainly the bigger guys.</v>

2544
01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Well that has been a couple of women </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have died from heart attacks.</v>

2545
01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:18.930
<v Speaker 1>So did steroids contribute to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.</v>

2546
01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:20.230
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2547
01:54:20.231 --> 01:54:21.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else were they doing?</v>

2548
01:54:21.331 --> 01:54:22.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual cases,</v>

2549
01:54:22.531 --> 01:54:27.531
<v Speaker 1>who knows with taking pain pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a antiinflammatories or they're doing </v>

2550
01:54:28.831 --> 01:54:31.120
<v Speaker 1>recreational drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of,</v>

2551
01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:33.460
<v Speaker 1>a lot of factors there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2552
01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:38.840
<v Speaker 1>but I think would be probably fair to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that using steroids over a longterm </v>

2553
01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:42.960
<v Speaker 1>will probably increase your risk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart disease perhaps.</v>

2554
01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:46.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it causes some inflammation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lining of the arteries.</v>

2555
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Can raise the blood pressure a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit and so on.</v>

2556
01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:51.730
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2557
01:54:51.731 --> 01:54:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2558
01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I compare it to smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2559
01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:57.210
<v Speaker 1>probably not as bad though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2560
01:54:57.260 --> 01:55:00.330
<v Speaker 1>So the way I look at it as I smoked for </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years and then I stopped.</v>

2561
01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:01.310
<v Speaker 1>So now</v>

2562
01:55:01.610 --> 01:55:06.020
<v Speaker 2>quit stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now speaking of smoking good stuff.</v>

2563
01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:09.950
<v Speaker 2>How did you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you find out about DMT and how'd</v>

2564
01:55:09.951 --> 01:55:14.951
<v Speaker 2>you get involved?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I read something about you </v>

2565
01:55:14.951 --> 01:55:15.950
<v Speaker 2>having these positive dmt experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2566
01:55:15.951 --> 01:55:18.720
<v Speaker 2>How strange is it reading about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2567
01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:23.980
<v Speaker 2>massive bodybuilder now getting into </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic drugs while I'm speaking </v>

2568
01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:25.150
<v Speaker 2>openly about that first time</v>

2569
01:55:25.570 --> 01:55:27.070
<v Speaker 1>did I asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on in Brazil.</v>

2570
01:55:27.130 --> 01:55:28.930
<v Speaker 1>I met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife was outside,</v>

2571
01:55:29.710 --> 01:55:32.140
<v Speaker 1>she lived in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we went out to the Amazon and the,</v>

2572
01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:35.650
<v Speaker 1>well this was like 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2573
01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:39.580
<v Speaker 1>so people weren't really not like now </v>
<v Speaker 1>people know what I'll ask her is because</v>

2574
01:55:39.581 --> 01:55:43.500
<v Speaker 1>so much information out there yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about I'm talking about is a ton</v>

2575
01:55:43.501 --> 01:55:45.480
<v Speaker 1>of stuff on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2576
01:55:45.570 --> 01:55:50.570
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't so much then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I heard about it and I heard about </v>

2577
01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:53.301
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a life changing experience and all </v>

2578
01:55:53.301 --> 01:55:55.371
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were out in Brazil and we've got </v>

2579
01:55:55.371 --> 01:55:56.250
<v Speaker 1>this guide and ask him for Ios Oscar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

2580
01:55:57.630 --> 01:56:02.630
<v Speaker 1>bring me these two balls of brown stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know to this day if it was </v>

2581
01:56:02.630 --> 01:56:05.580
<v Speaker 1>really Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just got really sick and didn't </v>

2582
01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:07.560
<v Speaker 1>see any great revelations apart from </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got this thing in my head.</v>

2583
01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Stop poisoning yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the night before I'd been out </v>

2584
01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:12.560
<v Speaker 1>drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting drunk and everything.</v>

2585
01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:15.570
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was my experience with that.</v>

2586
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Then a friend of mine out out here in </v>
<v Speaker 1>California actually I knew about dmt.</v>

2587
01:56:20.131 --> 01:56:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I used to live in Amsterdam and I read </v>
<v Speaker 1>the DMT,</v>

2588
01:56:23.131 --> 01:56:25.290
<v Speaker 1>the spirit molecule and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I knew about it,</v>

2589
01:56:25.291 --> 01:56:28.830
<v Speaker 1>but I had no idea get the stuff away you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get it from and everything.</v>

2590
01:56:29.370 --> 01:56:31.560
<v Speaker 1>So a friend of mine got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2591
01:56:32.250 --> 01:56:37.250
<v Speaker 1>that was my first experience of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving the room,</v>

2592
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:39.630
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the planet.</v>

2593
01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:45.360
<v Speaker 1>And then since then I had to some very </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive ios grew experiences,</v>

2594
01:56:45.361 --> 01:56:49.990
<v Speaker 1>but with a shaman and doing properly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>prepare in like five days of know,</v>

2595
01:56:50.250 --> 01:56:55.250
<v Speaker 1>restricted diet and no sex and all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of things you do to prepare and </v>

2596
01:56:55.250 --> 01:56:56.980
<v Speaker 1>also afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2597
01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:02.600
<v Speaker 1>so dmt is like blow the fucking doors of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your perception and realize that this </v>

2598
01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:04.590
<v Speaker 1>world we're in is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2599
01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:06.360
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a little illusion,</v>

2600
01:57:06.361 --> 01:57:06.570
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2601
01:57:06.570 --> 01:57:09.330
<v Speaker 1>There's so much more outside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2602
01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:11.760
<v Speaker 1>so there was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with the DMT,</v>

2603
01:57:11.761 --> 01:57:16.761
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like you've got a computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>with like so much storage space and </v>

2604
01:57:17.791 --> 01:57:21.270
<v Speaker 1>you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a thousand times more than you</v>

2605
01:57:21.271 --> 01:57:26.271
<v Speaker 1>can retain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see all this stuff and while </v>

2606
01:57:26.271 --> 01:57:26.271
<v Speaker 1>you're there you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know everything.</v>

2607
01:57:26.271 --> 01:57:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you come back,</v>

2608
01:57:28.051 --> 01:57:30.540
<v Speaker 1>how much of it can you hold onto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2609
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've sent it and that's like,</v>

2610
01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:34.230
<v Speaker 1>makes you look at everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

2611
01:57:34.650 --> 01:57:39.650
<v Speaker 1>What the Ios is over hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like from the Ios I actually </v>

2612
01:57:39.650 --> 01:57:44.031
<v Speaker 1>benefited more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like going through therapy or </v>

2613
01:57:44.031 --> 01:57:44.430
<v Speaker 1>something because it was much slower and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't digest it,</v>

2614
01:57:44.431 --> 01:57:46.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so um,</v>

2615
01:57:46.050 --> 01:57:48.510
<v Speaker 1>but doing it with the Shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2616
01:57:48.511 --> 01:57:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I did it with a guy called Gmo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other Railo and his,</v>

2617
01:57:52.530 --> 01:57:57.530
<v Speaker 1>one of the top guys in the world from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peru comes to Spain a couple of times a </v>

2618
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:57.530
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

2619
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:59.010
<v Speaker 1>So I did it with him and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2620
01:57:59.011 --> 01:58:00.420
<v Speaker 1>it's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2621
01:58:00.421 --> 01:58:04.680
<v Speaker 1>it's probably two or three years since I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did dmt because I sat down one day and I</v>

2622
01:58:04.681 --> 01:58:07.440
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually I fasted for three days before,</v>

2623
01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:09.420
<v Speaker 1>so I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in the zone.</v>

2624
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:10.950
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2625
01:58:10.951 --> 01:58:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got my dmt here,</v>

2626
01:58:12.991 --> 01:58:17.991
<v Speaker 1>I've got my vaporizer here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fucking smoke as much DMT </v>

2627
01:58:17.991 --> 01:58:18.720
<v Speaker 1>as I possibly can to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2628
01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:21.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like gone and pass out.</v>

2629
01:58:22.290 --> 01:58:27.290
<v Speaker 1>So I had that experience and since then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't feel any need to do it.</v>

2630
01:58:27.591 --> 01:58:29.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything more I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take from it.</v>

2631
01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:31.780
<v Speaker 4>I've had many people tell me the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2632
01:58:31.810 --> 01:58:35.230
<v Speaker 4>They had such a profound breakthrough </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience that they're like,</v>

2633
01:58:35.231 --> 01:58:35.950
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

2634
01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:39.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a crazy one in around 2000,</v>

2635
01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:40.930
<v Speaker 4>I want to say like two,</v>

2636
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:45.340
<v Speaker 3>eight or nine or some point that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I took a long time off.</v>

2637
01:58:45.341 --> 01:58:48.160
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do it again till like five </v>
<v Speaker 3>years later maybe.</v>

2638
01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:50.200
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty intense man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

2639
01:58:50.201 --> 01:58:54.610
<v Speaker 3>the Ios was nice because it comes in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice and subtle and you go through hours</v>

2640
01:58:54.611 --> 01:58:56.570
<v Speaker 3>of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But DMT is like,</v>

2641
01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:59.550
<v Speaker 3>last time I did feel very anxious when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd like,</v>

2642
01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:03.020
<v Speaker 3>like it's almost like you're leaving </v>
<v Speaker 3>your body and you know,</v>

2643
01:59:03.730 --> 01:59:07.080
<v Speaker 3>so you get that bit of anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once you go,</v>

2644
01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:09.190
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>

2645
01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:11.500
<v Speaker 3>But if you've done it more than one time</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a day,</v>

2646
01:59:11.590 --> 01:59:13.580
<v Speaker 3>like multiple times in a night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2647
01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:15.370
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2648
01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:17.560
<v Speaker 3>just blasted it as far as it could go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was it.</v>

2649
01:59:17.590 --> 01:59:21.810
<v Speaker 3>I've done it several times over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>course of a few hours and uh,</v>

2650
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:24.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are more comfortable letting go that</v>

2651
01:59:24.761 --> 01:59:27.910
<v Speaker 3>way and some sort of a strange way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it never gets less alien.</v>

2652
01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a,</v>

2653
01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna mention his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know his name,</v>

2654
01:59:31.251 --> 01:59:34.670
<v Speaker 1>but we had an experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and my friend a few months ago,</v>

2655
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:36.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2656
01:59:36.290 --> 01:59:38.780
<v Speaker 1>that I'd never seen before because </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually people take dmt,</v>

2657
01:59:38.781 --> 01:59:43.781
<v Speaker 1>they very calm and sit in the chair and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd go off and you might start </v>

2658
01:59:43.781 --> 01:59:43.890
<v Speaker 1>laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2659
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:44.960
<v Speaker 1>you don't move much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2660
01:59:45.650 --> 01:59:47.900
<v Speaker 1>And this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just like freaked out,</v>

2661
01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:51.260
<v Speaker 1>like it wasn't for 10 minutes or half an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour on.</v>

2662
01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:55.920
<v Speaker 1>My friend was a former MMA fights used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight with shamrock.</v>

2663
01:59:55.930 --> 01:59:57.920
<v Speaker 1>So we're hitting in a wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques.</v>

2664
01:59:57.921 --> 02:00:00.800
<v Speaker 1>So we had to hold this guy on the floor </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop him from hurting himself because</v>

2665
02:00:00.801 --> 02:00:03.440
<v Speaker 1>it was totally freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I could see the guy was going through</v>

2666
02:00:03.441 --> 02:00:06.380
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something traumatic from the past.</v>

2667
02:00:06.381 --> 02:00:08.480
<v Speaker 1>So today I messaged them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

2668
02:00:08.481 --> 02:00:10.070
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you ever find out what the guy,</v>

2669
02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:10.640
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2670
02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:11.750
<v Speaker 1>what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2671
02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:13.550
<v Speaker 1>because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2672
02:00:13.551 --> 02:00:15.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was from his birth.</v>

2673
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:18.000
<v Speaker 3>What's his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from his birth when he was born,</v>

2674
02:00:18.001 --> 02:00:20.050
<v Speaker 3>he had the cord around his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Geez.</v>

2675
02:00:20.430 --> 02:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>And then he went back and relive this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that had been in the back of his </v>

2676
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>mind all his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subconscious,</v>

2677
02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>subconscious as a huge effect on us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know it's there.</v>

2678
02:00:30.930 --> 02:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>So now he opened that box and let it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's gone now,</v>

2679
02:00:34.021 --> 02:00:34.070
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

2680
02:00:34.100 --> 02:00:37.080
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it can be therapeutic.</v>

2681
02:00:37.081 --> 02:00:39.070
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought this guy's like,</v>

2682
02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:40.760
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to be.</v>

2683
02:00:40.770 --> 02:00:41.820
<v Speaker 3>But when it came back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

2684
02:00:41.821 --> 02:00:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2685
02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:44.220
<v Speaker 3>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2686
02:00:44.221 --> 02:00:44.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>

2687
02:00:44.731 --> 02:00:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know what just happened?</v>

2688
02:00:46.531 --> 02:00:47.100
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2689
02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:47.730
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good thing.</v>

2690
02:00:47.731 --> 02:00:49.620
<v Speaker 3>We filmed at them and go home and watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2691
02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:53.040
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend of freaked out too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He freaked out.</v>

2692
02:00:53.070 --> 02:00:55.260
<v Speaker 3>He threw up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took his shirt off.</v>

2693
02:00:55.410 --> 02:00:57.420
<v Speaker 3>I was running around saying a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit.</v>

2694
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:58.500
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2695
02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:59.760
<v Speaker 3>after he came down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2696
02:00:59.790 --> 02:01:01.860
<v Speaker 3>we calmed him down and took like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 minutes.</v>

2697
02:01:01.861 --> 02:01:03.500
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2698
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:08.510
<v Speaker 3>well obviously I'm a work in progress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but never forget that,</v>

2699
02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:13.320
<v Speaker 3>but did he know what it was that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>troubling him so much?</v>

2700
02:01:13.650 --> 02:01:15.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a bad childhood for sure.</v>

2701
02:01:15.661 --> 02:01:18.010
<v Speaker 3>Everything is like most of our shit is </v>
<v Speaker 3>from that,</v>

2702
02:01:18.011 --> 02:01:20.490
<v Speaker 3>right from the developing years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2703
02:01:20.491 --> 02:01:21.240
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2704
02:01:21.241 --> 02:01:24.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean in especially like real traumatic</v>
<v Speaker 3>ones,</v>

2705
02:01:24.751 --> 02:01:29.751
<v Speaker 3>abuse being beaten by his Stepdad and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the punches fucked up shit that was just</v>

2706
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:32.490
<v Speaker 3>haunting him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

2707
02:01:32.491 --> 02:01:34.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>helps you to come to terms with that.</v>

2708
02:01:34.860 --> 02:01:38.570
<v Speaker 3>Especially the Ios because it's longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like the first time I did Iowaska</v>

2709
02:01:38.590 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 3>properly with Shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like</v>

2710
02:01:41.210 --> 02:01:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I was a different person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next day I felt it was done 20 years</v>

2711
02:01:44.121 --> 02:01:49.121
<v Speaker 1>of fucking therapy or something and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of stuff I'd worked out in my </v>

2712
02:01:49.121 --> 02:01:49.760
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could even see other people's point of</v>

2713
02:01:49.761 --> 02:01:52.540
<v Speaker 1>view on things and that I couldn't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

2714
02:01:52.810 --> 02:01:53.890
<v Speaker 2>That's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2715
02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Seeing other people's point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially a guy like you who's so </v>

2716
02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:02.371
<v Speaker 2>determined and goal oriented and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut out all the bullshit and get it </v>

2717
02:02:02.371 --> 02:02:02.371
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

2718
02:02:02.430 --> 02:02:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be a little insensitive to other </v>

2719
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.430
<v Speaker 1>people's feelings around it because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like</v>

2720
02:02:08.580 --> 02:02:11.910
<v Speaker 2>nothing keep up my way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a male thing in particular.</v>

2721
02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:12.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2722
02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:18.060
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bodybuilding and intensity and </v>

2723
02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:22.341
<v Speaker 2>competition and then being the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguably the best ever and just fucking </v>

2724
02:02:22.650 --> 02:02:23.970
<v Speaker 2>finding every day.</v>

2725
02:02:25.330 --> 02:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>A couple of weeks ago it was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see yourself as other people </v>

2726
02:02:30.330 --> 02:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you mean?</v>

2727
02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>He said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was a kid,</v>

2728
02:02:34.150 --> 02:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>first of all the size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2729
02:02:35.790 --> 02:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>it was fucking huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's your persona.</v>

2730
02:02:38.670 --> 02:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>You might've said to me something very </v>
<v Speaker 1>like normal,</v>

2731
02:02:41.431 --> 02:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2732
02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:44.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2733
02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing with a dog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2734
02:02:45.961 --> 02:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>just something normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2735
02:02:47.191 --> 02:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be like,</v>

2736
02:02:48.930 --> 02:02:53.930
<v Speaker 1>because just your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your presence made me feel like the </v>

2737
02:02:53.930 --> 02:02:53.930
<v Speaker 1>inner</v>

2738
02:02:53.930 --> 02:02:58.500
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be weird when you're a </v>

2739
02:02:58.500 --> 02:02:58.500
<v Speaker 2>little tiny kid and your dad's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gorilla.</v>

2740
02:02:58.500 --> 02:02:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember he did a</v>

2741
02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a kickbox and right.</v>

2742

<v Speaker 1>It's just trying to help the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>general vibe and the,</v>

2771
02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:21.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they touch somebody else and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the butterfly wings flap here and the </v>

2777

<v Speaker 1>other side of the as a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>in that regard,</v>

2780
02:04:42.431 --> 02:04:42.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2781

02:04:44.111 --> 02:04:46.790
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the time is so many people that are</v>

2783
02:04:46.791 --> 02:04:50.050
<v Speaker 1>more aware now than like 20 years ago,</v>

2784
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:51.080
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like,</v>

2785
02:04:51.081 --> 02:04:52.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's parallels to bodybuilding,</v>

2786
02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:53.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It net.</v>

2787
02:04:53.580 --> 02:04:58.580
<v Speaker 2>When Arnold first started doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was very little information for </v>

2788
02:04:58.580 --> 02:05:02.781
<v Speaker 2>Harley and you guys got to see what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>did and build upon that and more </v>

2789
02:05:02.781 --> 02:05:04.560
<v Speaker 2>information came out and now because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet,</v>

2790
02:05:04.561 --> 02:05:06.890
<v Speaker 2>there's so much information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much information.</v>

2791
02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:09.570
<v Speaker 2>People are aware more of what it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

2792
02:05:09.810 --> 02:05:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Psychedelics,</v>

2793
02:05:11.521 --> 02:05:13.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago,</v>

2794
02:05:13.090 --> 02:05:18.090
<v Speaker 2>there's so much ignorance and so little </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of and also so little </v>

2795
02:05:18.090 --> 02:05:20.160
<v Speaker 2>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to something as</v>

2796
02:05:20.161 --> 02:05:25.161
<v Speaker 2>extreme as dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's still a giant percentage of our </v>

2797
02:05:25.161 --> 02:05:25.161
<v Speaker 2>population doesn't even know what it is.</v>

2798
02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should all take it.</v>

2799
02:05:27.740 --> 02:05:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Especially the fucking politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to get those politicians,</v>

2800
02:05:31.550 --> 02:05:33.780
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking get them in a room and force</v>

2801
02:05:33.781 --> 02:05:37.850
<v Speaker 1>them to take dmt and then see how </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to behave afterwards,</v>

2802
02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:43.120
<v Speaker 1>how they're going to look at the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and treat people after they've had that </v>

2803
02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:43.120
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2804
02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it can be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2805
02:05:46.401 --> 02:05:50.390
<v Speaker 1>so self centered and unfeeling as most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them are.</v>

2806
02:05:50.630 --> 02:05:51.980
<v Speaker 1>After you've had that experience.</v>

2807
02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:54.850
<v Speaker 2>I think that any breakthrough </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experience,</v>

2808
02:05:54.851 --> 02:05:58.130
<v Speaker 2>whether it's silicide been or LSD or </v>
<v Speaker 2>DMT,</v>

2809
02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:00.120
<v Speaker 1>they all pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2810
02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:03.030
<v Speaker 1>ego dissolving roads to the same place.</v>

2811
02:06:03.590 --> 02:06:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Terence Mckenna used to say that DMT is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the center of the Mandala.</v>

2812
02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:12.100
<v Speaker 2>The way I describe DMT is it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms times a million plus amens and</v>

2813
02:06:12.520 --> 02:06:17.520
<v Speaker 2>then it just seemed so titanic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee Bizarre that there's like,</v>

2814
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to describe it to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I always say,</v>

2815
02:06:20.210 --> 02:06:21.730
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell them what to do it.</v>

2816
02:06:22.070 --> 02:06:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you some bullshit</v>

2817
02:06:23.470 --> 02:06:26.680
<v Speaker 1>or because you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>

2818
02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:30.040
<v Speaker 1>we don't have the words to put it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

2819
02:06:30.041 --> 02:06:31.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can attempt to.</v>

2820
02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:35.530
<v Speaker 1>I went to this place was not a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have the word for it.</v>

2821
02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:39.250
<v Speaker 1>The places everywhere is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's colors,</v>

2822
02:06:39.251 --> 02:06:44.251
<v Speaker 1>there's numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shapes and people think things and </v>

2823
02:06:44.251 --> 02:06:44.950
<v Speaker 1>this is like everything is all one </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing.</v>

2824
02:06:44.951 --> 02:06:49.570
<v Speaker 1>And what I noticed is like my breath was</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to it.</v>

2825
02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was in the trip and I went like </v>

2826
02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:54.820
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the whole thing moved.</v>

2827
02:06:55.110 --> 02:07:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I really let me try this then and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing moved and then there was</v>

2828
02:07:00.491 --> 02:07:04.330
<v Speaker 1>music playing and the music was part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing as well.</v>

2829
02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Like the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what to call it,</v>

2830
02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:08.560
<v Speaker 1>the thing that place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a word,</v>

2831
02:07:08.561 --> 02:07:08.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2832
02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:14.160
<v Speaker 2>we played a bunch of these shaman and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Shaman who grids is the last time I </v>

2833
02:07:15.611 --> 02:07:20.611
<v Speaker 2>did it and the Shaman [inaudible] like </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally made the DMT images dance like</v>

2834
02:07:21.070 --> 02:07:26.070
<v Speaker 2>they had figured out a way with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds and songs to integrate these </v>

2835
02:07:27.131 --> 02:07:30.910
<v Speaker 2>beats into dmt trips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you would take these trips,</v>

2836
02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:36.130
<v Speaker 2>these shamans had figured out the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds and songs how to make</v>

2837
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:39.940
<v Speaker 4>the trip more intense and sort of guided</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a strange way.</v>

2838
02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:42.370
<v Speaker 1>What I had with um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a shaman,</v>

2839
02:07:42.371 --> 02:07:47.371
<v Speaker 1>with the Ios guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He comes around and sings these arrows </v>

2840
02:07:47.371 --> 02:07:51.460
<v Speaker 1>and like changes tone and then it goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper base in his chest and it's like,</v>

2841
02:07:53.110 --> 02:07:54.760
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes part of it,</v>

2842
02:07:54.761 --> 02:07:58.330
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was even moving in voluntarily.</v>

2843
02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:02.260
<v Speaker 1>I was my arms going up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my body was moving and it's like I'm not</v>

2844
02:08:02.261 --> 02:08:07.261
<v Speaker 1>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know even know how it's </v>

2845
02:08:07.261 --> 02:08:07.261
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like somebody picking my arms up in</v>

2846
02:08:07.261 --> 02:08:07.261
<v Speaker 1>a move and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2847
02:08:07.261 --> 02:08:11.230
<v Speaker 1>started dancing around with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming part of this rhythm.</v>

2848
02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2849
02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:16.710
<v Speaker 4>I had an experience once one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first times ever did dmt where I saw the</v>

2850
02:08:16.711 --> 02:08:18.690
<v Speaker 4>difference between negative and positive</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>

2851
02:08:19.020 --> 02:08:24.020
<v Speaker 4>Like I started thinking negative and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was all this like black and dark </v>

2852
02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:25.590
<v Speaker 4>green and like these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2853
02:08:25.650 --> 02:08:30.650
<v Speaker 4>threatening shapes and colors and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>something recognized what was going on </v>

2854
02:08:33.391 --> 02:08:37.560
<v Speaker 4>in my brain that the shapes and images </v>
<v Speaker 4>were connected to negative thinking.</v>

2855
02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:41.880
<v Speaker 4>And I relaxed in the shapes kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 4>settled down.</v>

2856
02:08:41.881 --> 02:08:46.881
<v Speaker 4>And then I started thinking positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I heard all these expressions of </v>

2857
02:08:46.881 --> 02:08:51.801
<v Speaker 4>love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like you're hearing it but you're </v>

2858
02:08:51.801 --> 02:08:53.841
<v Speaker 4>not really hearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the thoughts are getting into </v>

2859
02:08:53.841 --> 02:08:56.421
<v Speaker 4>your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like someone's trying to say it without </v>

2860
02:08:56.421 --> 02:08:56.790
<v Speaker 4>using words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I started thinking positive and</v>

2861
02:08:56.791 --> 02:09:01.410
<v Speaker 4>from those dark images blossom these </v>
<v Speaker 4>like beautiful,</v>

2862
02:09:01.411 --> 02:09:06.411
<v Speaker 4>like geometric flowers and colors and </v>
<v Speaker 4>impossibly spectacularly beautiful </v>

2863
02:09:07.081 --> 02:09:08.280
<v Speaker 4>images.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2864
02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:09.300
<v Speaker 4>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

2865
02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:14.400
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I recognized in my mind there is an </v>

2866
02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:16.560
<v Speaker 4>actual thing that happens when you think</v>
<v Speaker 4>negatively and an actual,</v>

2867
02:09:16.561 --> 02:09:19.770
<v Speaker 4>it's not just some sort of affect the </v>
<v Speaker 4>program,</v>

2868
02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:20.820
<v Speaker 4>they're in a program,</v>

2869
02:09:22.050 --> 02:09:27.050
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the program's coming towards you and </v>

2870
02:09:27.050 --> 02:09:27.870
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts and it's interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the program.</v>

2871
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why conflict,</v>

2872
02:09:30.330 --> 02:09:33.270
<v Speaker 4>interpersonal conflict between people </v>
<v Speaker 4>can be so negative.</v>

2873
02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:36.690
<v Speaker 4>It's not just as simple as you and some </v>
<v Speaker 4>person getting into an argument.</v>

2874
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:41.990
<v Speaker 4>It's those dark images and those </v>
<v Speaker 4>negative forces becomes a part of your </v>

2875
02:09:42.211 --> 02:09:42.780
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>

2876
02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I had exactly the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2877
02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:50.150
<v Speaker 1>but it was almost like a tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in this tunnel and it was the same</v>

2878
02:09:50.151 --> 02:09:50.490
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2879
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:52.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oldest</v>

2880
02:09:52.860 --> 02:09:56.340
<v Speaker 1>images around and scary and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2881
02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I instinctively I knew to be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxed and I started laughing like,</v>

2882
02:10:01.111 --> 02:10:01.500
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

2883
02:10:02.780 --> 02:10:04.920
<v Speaker 4>And not even real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not even real.</v>

2884
02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:06.270
<v Speaker 4>And when I said that</v>

2885
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:09.010
<v Speaker 1>it went away and I just got this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that came into my head.</v>

2886
02:10:09.230 --> 02:10:11.690
<v Speaker 1>You have just been in the valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2887
02:10:12.910 --> 02:10:17.910
<v Speaker 1>was a cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Valley of the shadow of death is </v>

2888
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:17.910
<v Speaker 1>sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Lord's prayer,</v>

2889
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I think though we walk through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Valley of the shadow of death,</v>

2890
02:10:20.291 --> 02:10:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I fear no evil because God's bought </v>
<v Speaker 1>aside.</v>

2891
02:10:23.170 --> 02:10:25.570
<v Speaker 1>I vaguely remember from school or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2892
02:10:26.020 --> 02:10:31.020
<v Speaker 1>but I got this thing that you were there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're in the valley of the shadow </v>

2893
02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:32.010
<v Speaker 1>of death and because you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you would like,</v>

2894
02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:32.890
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even,</v>

2895
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:35.750
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just disappeared.</v>

2896
02:10:35.751 --> 02:10:37.310
<v Speaker 1>And then it went to somewhere really </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

2897
02:10:37.490 --> 02:10:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2898
02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:41.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just wonder how much his real,</v>

2899
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2900
02:10:42.430 --> 02:10:45.300
<v Speaker 4>it's such a hippie thing to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much is real?</v>

2901
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:46.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2902
02:10:46.801 --> 02:10:51.801
<v Speaker 4>I've been having these thoughts a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>lately about how much of how much of </v>

2903
02:10:51.961 --> 02:10:54.810
<v Speaker 4>live do you manifest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much of life is real?</v>

2904
02:10:54.811 --> 02:10:59.811
<v Speaker 4>Because it's such a bullshit thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it's such a hippie thing to think </v>

2905
02:10:59.811 --> 02:11:00.450
<v Speaker 4>and so many people that say that are so </v>
<v Speaker 4>annoying.</v>

2906
02:11:00.530 --> 02:11:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But scientists are saying the same thing</v>

2907
02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:04.650
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quantum physicists saying,</v>

2908
02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:07.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a fingerstick names.</v>

2909
02:11:07.890 --> 02:11:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Profess at guides know if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with him.</v>

2910
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Professor Gates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2911
02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:17.920
<v Speaker 1>he said that they've broken down reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the smallest level and it's a </v>

2912
02:11:19.041 --> 02:11:21.020
<v Speaker 1>computer code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2913
02:11:21.021 --> 02:11:26.021
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that gun code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a specific computer code of Zeros </v>

2914
02:11:26.021 --> 02:11:28.250
<v Speaker 1>and ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was invented in the 19 forties by</v>

2915
02:11:28.270 --> 02:11:28.520
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2916
02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:31.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that guy being interviewed.</v>

2917
02:11:31.470 --> 02:11:34.890
<v Speaker 4>We actually talked about it with Neil </v>
<v Speaker 4>degrasse Tyson and he,</v>

2918
02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.150
<v Speaker 4>I tried to get him to sort of break it </v>
<v Speaker 4>down and explain.</v>

2919
02:11:39.390 --> 02:11:44.390
<v Speaker 4>But what it is is essentially that when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you break reality down to the smallest </v>

2920
02:11:44.611 --> 02:11:49.611
<v Speaker 4>level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it mimics a self-correcting computer </v>

2921
02:11:49.611 --> 02:11:50.670
<v Speaker 4>code.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not just not just a computer code,</v>

2922
02:11:50.970 --> 02:11:53.160
<v Speaker 4>but a computer code.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That self correcting,</v>

2923
02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:58.400
<v Speaker 4>which is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just said a bunch of noises that I </v>

2924
02:11:58.400 --> 02:11:58.400
<v Speaker 4>don't even understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2925
02:11:58.400 --> 02:11:58.530
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gone beyond</v>

2926
02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:04.100
<v Speaker 1>now you're getting a spirituality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>science coming together because the </v>

2927
02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:05.160
<v Speaker 1>scientists are saying what spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>masters,</v>

2928
02:12:05.570 --> 02:12:08.610
<v Speaker 1>they're already telling us that we live </v>
<v Speaker 1>in an illusion and everything is inside.</v>

2929
02:12:08.611 --> 02:12:13.611
<v Speaker 1>Not outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was saying that thousands of years </v>

2930
02:12:13.611 --> 02:12:13.611
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some of it is real,</v>

2931
02:12:13.611 --> 02:12:15.420
<v Speaker 4>like you have to work hard or you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>get results,</v>

2932
02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:16.590
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like your,</v>

2933
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:21.790
<v Speaker 4>your hard fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pragmatic reality of being the best </v>

2934
02:12:21.790 --> 02:12:24.690
<v Speaker 4>bodybuilder in the world revolves around</v>
<v Speaker 4>actual work,</v>

2935
02:12:24.691 --> 02:12:25.620
<v Speaker 4>real results</v>

2936
02:12:26.210 --> 02:12:28.550
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this reality and this program,</v>

2937
02:12:28.700 --> 02:12:30.580
<v Speaker 4>but also to do physical stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2938
02:12:30.830 --> 02:12:34.160
<v Speaker 4>probably there was a lot of mental shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on there too.</v>

2939
02:12:34.250 --> 02:12:36.170
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The work was being done,</v>

2940
02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:38.540
<v Speaker 4>but also there was probably a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

2941
02:12:38.570 --> 02:12:43.570
<v Speaker 1>all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's all I thought about like </v>

2942
02:12:43.570 --> 02:12:43.570
<v Speaker 1>literally all fucking day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2943
02:12:44.150 --> 02:12:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I had to have the physical goods to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happen.</v>

2944
02:12:47.511 --> 02:12:49.590
<v Speaker 1>I could dream about being basketball </v>
<v Speaker 1>player all day.</v>

2945
02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:52.760
<v Speaker 1>It probably wouldn't help me because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not built to be a basketball player,</v>

2946
02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:55.790
<v Speaker 1>but those thoughts were just going out </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

2947
02:12:55.791 --> 02:13:00.791
<v Speaker 1>And I was a kid in Birmingham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial city in England and I was </v>

2948
02:13:02.031 --> 02:13:04.700
<v Speaker 1>thinking I'm going to go to America and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be a bodybuilder.</v>

2949
02:13:04.701 --> 02:13:07.340
<v Speaker 1>And everyone around me was like the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>you took.</v>

2950
02:13:09.010 --> 02:13:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

2951
02:13:09.891 --> 02:13:14.891
<v Speaker 1>that was those thoughts all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's like a holographic </v>

2952
02:13:14.891 --> 02:13:17.540
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in what we influenced it,</v>

2953
02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:19.790
<v Speaker 1>we interact with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our thoughts.</v>

2954
02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:24.140
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of where I'm getting at now </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some way,</v>

2955
02:13:24.230 --> 02:13:29.230
<v Speaker 1>and the guys that were spiritual masters</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Buddha or the guy that called Jesus</v>

2956
02:13:31.741 --> 02:13:36.741
<v Speaker 1>and all that know that apparently did </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that were called miracles because</v>

2957
02:13:36.811 --> 02:13:41.550
<v Speaker 1>they were outside the box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the physical reality we live in.</v>

2958
02:13:41.850 --> 02:13:43.590
<v Speaker 1>How can they walk on water that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>

2959
02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:49.260
<v Speaker 1>but if you are so advanced that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really knew it was a program,</v>

2960
02:13:49.890 --> 02:13:54.480
<v Speaker 1>then you can like heck the program and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they able to do it.</v>

2961
02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:56.940
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of remove themselves out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the program.</v>

2962
02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you.</v>

2963
02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:01.730
<v Speaker 1>How can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2964
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:03.570
<v Speaker 3>how can guys levitate or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2965
02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:05.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2966
02:14:05.611 --> 02:14:06.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't there.</v>

2967
02:14:07.050 --> 02:14:12.050
<v Speaker 3>See that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence whatsoever that </v>

2968
02:14:12.050 --> 02:14:12.050
<v Speaker 3>anybody actually can levitate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2969
02:14:12.050 --> 02:14:15.450
<v Speaker 3>people have witnessed people doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have witnessed is a lot of.</v>

2970
02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:18.620
<v Speaker 4>We'll set some weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem with people saying things as</v>

2971
02:14:18.621 --> 02:14:23.621
<v Speaker 4>they might have literally seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't mean it wasn't a </v>

2972
02:14:23.621 --> 02:14:23.621
<v Speaker 4>hallucination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then again,</v>

2973
02:14:23.621 --> 02:14:26.810
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean that a hallucination </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't an alternative</v>

2974
02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:28.930
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it,</v>

2975
02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:34.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people say you elucidate when you take </v>

2976
02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:35.670
<v Speaker 3>lsd or dmt or just elucidating hio or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just seeing more stuff</v>

2977
02:14:35.690 --> 02:14:37.940
<v Speaker 1>that you can't normally see because now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've shifted your,</v>

2978
02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:39.140
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2979
02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:40.310
<v Speaker 1>your vibration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2980
02:14:40.410 --> 02:14:41.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2981
02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:46.280
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I tried to </v>
<v Speaker 4>explain to someone about dmt that have </v>

2982
02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:50.901
<v Speaker 4>kind of used over and over again since </v>
<v Speaker 4>then is that I felt like I met with the </v>

2983
02:14:51.841 --> 02:14:56.841
<v Speaker 4>divine force of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like have or he divined forest,</v>

2984
02:14:57.270 --> 02:15:02.270
<v Speaker 4>maybe my puny little brain can only </v>
<v Speaker 4>comprehend this level of divinity and </v>

2985
02:15:03.151 --> 02:15:08.151
<v Speaker 4>that maybe perhaps it was something even</v>
<v Speaker 4>more profoundly more powerful and </v>

2986
02:15:08.151 --> 02:15:11.340
<v Speaker 4>knowledgeable and wise past that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I wasn't ready to perceive it.</v>

2987
02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:16.520
<v Speaker 4>Then maybe there's levels to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's fractal just like everything </v>

2988
02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:16.520
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And someone said like,</v>

2989
02:15:16.590 --> 02:15:16.970
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2990
02:15:17.060 --> 02:15:18.940
<v Speaker 4>how do you know that wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hallucination like a.</v>

2991
02:15:18.941 --> 02:15:20.070
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could have been,</v>

2992
02:15:20.071 --> 02:15:25.071
<v Speaker 4>but here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether or not it was or wasn't the </v>

2993
02:15:25.071 --> 02:15:28.431
<v Speaker 4>experiences the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you really go into some other </v>

2994
02:15:28.431 --> 02:15:31.461
<v Speaker 4>dimension in God or you take a drug in </v>
<v Speaker 4>which you experience going to another </v>

2995
02:15:33.031 --> 02:15:36.330
<v Speaker 4>dimension and meeting God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still the same experience,</v>

2996
02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:37.740
<v Speaker 4>the exact same experience.</v>

2997
02:15:37.750 --> 02:15:42.750
<v Speaker 3>And why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is everybody's experience kind of </v>

2998
02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:42.750
<v Speaker 3>similar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2999
02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:44.200
<v Speaker 3>To have a whole totally different </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking illusion.</v>

3000
02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:49.320
<v Speaker 3>No one seems to think it's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one that I know who's ever done dmt </v>

3001
02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:49.610
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3002
02:15:49.930 --> 02:15:54.930
<v Speaker 3>it's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to be the same </v>

3003
02:15:54.930 --> 02:15:54.930
<v Speaker 3>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3004
02:15:54.930 --> 02:15:54.930
<v Speaker 3>you get your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your perspective.</v>

3005
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to a different point of view</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be different.</v>

3006
02:15:57.460 --> 02:16:00.270
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can only put.</v>

3007
02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody that's done dmt.</v>

3008
02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:06.710
<v Speaker 1>And then they've said that was not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive experience.</v>

3009
02:16:06.711 --> 02:16:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get anything from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every fucking body.</v>

3010
02:16:09.411 --> 02:16:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I know it was said that lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

3011
02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:16.830
<v Speaker 3>the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where am I?</v>

3012
02:16:17.710 --> 02:16:20.120
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are noises that come from my mouth?</v>

3013
02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:21.730
<v Speaker 3>And nobody's like,</v>

3014
02:16:23.170 --> 02:16:28.170
<v Speaker 1>nobody's ever said to me that even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy that I saw that looked like he was </v>

3015
02:16:28.170 --> 02:16:32.901
<v Speaker 1>getting raped by the devil because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that guy getting raped by the </v>

3016
02:16:32.901 --> 02:16:32.901
<v Speaker 1>download.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that,</v>

3017
02:16:32.901 --> 02:16:34.730
<v Speaker 1>but I saw his eyes and that's how I </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined somebodies eyes with</v>

3018
02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:39.430
<v Speaker 3>like that was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he looked like</v>

3019
02:16:41.070 --> 02:16:44.900
<v Speaker 1>an absolute terror is all I can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute terror.</v>

3020
02:16:44.901 --> 02:16:48.180
<v Speaker 1>So in this guy's eyes for like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

3021
02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:49.530
<v Speaker 1>but when it came back it was like,</v>

3022
02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:51.350
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the guy that was.</v>

3023
02:16:51.380 --> 02:16:52.760
<v Speaker 3>He didn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3024
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:54.290
<v Speaker 3>you okay dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man,</v>

3025
02:16:54.291 --> 02:16:56.700

<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3026
02:16:58.990 --> 02:17:01.280
<v Speaker 3>do you know what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>

3027
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to watch this video when you go</v>

3028
02:17:04.341 --> 02:17:05.520
<v Speaker 1>home because we fell into man.</v>

3029
02:17:06.510 --> 02:17:09.150
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend Doug Stan hope and he's talked</v>

3030
02:17:09.151 --> 02:17:14.151
<v Speaker 4>about this many times on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got him high on Dmt at my house and </v>

3031
02:17:14.151 --> 02:17:18.531
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the only guy that I've ever got </v>

3032
02:17:18.531 --> 02:17:20.721
<v Speaker 4>high on dmt that I worried about because</v>
<v Speaker 4>he fell over on the couch and started </v>

3033
02:17:20.721 --> 02:17:22.800
<v Speaker 4>moaning and like foam was coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>his mouth.</v>

3034
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:26.070
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's so unhealthy.</v>

3035
02:17:26.490 --> 02:17:29.250
<v Speaker 4>He smoked cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He drinks constantly.</v>

3036
02:17:29.310 --> 02:17:30.990
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

3037
02:17:30.991 --> 02:17:33.990
<v Speaker 4>did I break my friend that I was really </v>
<v Speaker 4>worried.</v>

3038
02:17:33.991 --> 02:17:38.991
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I should have considered the fact </v>

3039
02:17:38.991 --> 02:17:38.991
<v Speaker 4>this fucking guy doesn't really</v>

3040
02:17:38.991 --> 02:17:38.991
<v Speaker 1>take care of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3041
02:17:38.991 --> 02:17:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I think when your system's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>toxic,</v>

3042
02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:42.170
<v Speaker 1>you don't get the best.</v>

3043
02:17:42.270 --> 02:17:43.200
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he came out of it.</v>

3044
02:17:43.201 --> 02:17:45.270
<v Speaker 4>He got great results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He came out of it.</v>

3045
02:17:45.271 --> 02:17:50.271
<v Speaker 4>It was a fantastic experience for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He came out of it with all these </v>

3046
02:17:50.271 --> 02:17:51.210
<v Speaker 4>revelations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had great conversation about it,</v>

3047
02:17:51.660 --> 02:17:56.660
<v Speaker 4>but in the moment he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

3048
02:17:59.070 --> 02:18:00.990
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've killed him.</v>

3049
02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy was like spasm him and kicking </v>

3050
02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:08.591
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my friend had to hold him on the </v>

3051
02:18:08.591 --> 02:18:08.591
<v Speaker 1>floor to stop him smashing the furniture</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the south.</v>

3052
02:18:08.591 --> 02:18:09.230
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3053
02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:12.110
<v Speaker 1>And it was like thinking he was being </v>
<v Speaker 1>chosen 10 minutes.</v>

3054
02:18:12.170 --> 02:18:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh Gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

3055
02:18:14.690 --> 02:18:15.680
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

3056
02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:17.700
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was starting to get concerned.</v>

3057
02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:20.660
<v Speaker 1>Like Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half an hour later he came out of it,</v>

3058
02:18:20.690 --> 02:18:25.690
<v Speaker 1>but he's glad he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that he couldn't see himself at the </v>

3059
02:18:25.690 --> 02:18:25.960
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know.</v>

3060
02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever a float a flotation tank?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3061
02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:31.700
<v Speaker 1>I did it once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3062
02:18:31.701 --> 02:18:33.200
<v Speaker 1>funny enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>

3063
02:18:33.201 --> 02:18:38.201
<v Speaker 1>I read Frank Zane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frank Zane was doing flotation tanks </v>

3064
02:18:38.201 --> 02:18:38.201
<v Speaker 1>back in the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3065
02:18:38.201 --> 02:18:42.621
<v Speaker 1>those Samati tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I always wanted to do it and I saw </v>

3066
02:18:42.621 --> 02:18:46.451
<v Speaker 1>this place when I was over in England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went in there and I said to the </v>

3067
02:18:46.821 --> 02:18:48.290
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like talking about it,</v>

3068
02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:49.400
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

3069
02:18:49.401 --> 02:18:51.800
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3070
02:18:51.801 --> 02:18:53.600
<v Speaker 1>is it good to smoke weed before you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there?</v>

3071
02:18:54.090 --> 02:18:55.410
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you the truth.</v>

3072
02:18:55.411 --> 02:18:56.450
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people come here,</v>

3073
02:18:56.460 --> 02:18:58.190
<v Speaker 1>they smoke weed outside before they come</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

3074
02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:03.520
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the first time I think it should </v>

3075
02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:03.520
<v Speaker 1>just go with nothing and see how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>

3076
02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:08.250
<v Speaker 1>And I'll be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in there for like an hour thing </v>

3077
02:19:08.250 --> 02:19:08.690
<v Speaker 1>after 40 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got really fucking bored.</v>

3078
02:19:11.660 --> 02:19:13.460
<v Speaker 3>I thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I meditate every day,</v>

3079
02:19:13.461 --> 02:19:13.780
<v Speaker 3>every day.</v>

3080
02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was like,</v>

3081
02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:17.630
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fail.</v>

3082
02:19:17.631 --> 02:19:20.210
<v Speaker 1>This is any better than major in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation.</v>

3083
02:19:20.211 --> 02:19:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I just getting kind of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So really I wasn't,</v>

3084
02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:26.540
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't blown away by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I expected to be to be honest,</v>

3085
02:19:26.541 --> 02:19:27.320
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3086
02:19:27.620 --> 02:19:28.310
<v Speaker 1>done dmt</v>

3087
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:30.470
<v Speaker 4>and I'll ask her and asset and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

3088
02:19:30.471 --> 02:19:34.090
<v Speaker 4>So maybe my expectations were too high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3089
02:19:34.130 --> 02:19:38.030
<v Speaker 4>I always give the same advice I give.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say don't smoke weed the first time,</v>

3090
02:19:38.031 --> 02:19:42.590
<v Speaker 4>just go in and experience it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my thoughts are that isolation tanks</v>

3091
02:19:42.810 --> 02:19:47.810
<v Speaker 4>and the isolation tank experience is </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that it takes time to really </v>

3092
02:19:47.810 --> 02:19:52.181
<v Speaker 4>fully relax and settle in and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>layers to the onion and you got to go </v>

3093
02:19:52.221 --> 02:19:54.800
<v Speaker 4>deeper and deeper and peel those layers </v>
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>

3094
02:19:55.010 --> 02:20:00.010
<v Speaker 4>And I've done it so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have one in my basement and so I've </v>

3095
02:20:00.010 --> 02:20:00.560
<v Speaker 4>done it so many times now that when I go</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

3096
02:20:00.561 --> 02:20:03.980
<v Speaker 4>I can slide right in almost immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'll tell you this,</v>

3097
02:20:04.370 --> 02:20:09.140
<v Speaker 4>I rarely go in sober.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I almost always go in high as a kite and</v>

3098
02:20:09.380 --> 02:20:12.800
<v Speaker 4>edibles preferably or the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>

3099
02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:18.160
<v Speaker 4>I can have full blown psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences in the tank on edibles,</v>

3100
02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:20.600
<v Speaker 4>full blown visuals.</v>

3101
02:20:20.810 --> 02:20:22.610
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going into the jungle,</v>

3102
02:20:22.611 --> 02:20:26.000
<v Speaker 4>experiencing the center of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like intense,</v>

3103
02:20:26.001 --> 02:20:29.670
<v Speaker 4>intense stuff because the relaxation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3104
02:20:29.680 --> 02:20:34.680
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that you are the only </v>

3105
02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:37.031
<v Speaker 4>information you're taking in is there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a mild feeling of the water on your </v>

3106
02:20:37.371 --> 02:20:42.371
<v Speaker 4>body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very mild that you have to think about </v>

3107
02:20:42.371 --> 02:20:43.340
<v Speaker 4>to be aware of and occasionally you'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>touch the sides of the tank and you have</v>

3108
02:20:43.341 --> 02:20:48.341
<v Speaker 4>to kind of write yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no some water gets in there or </v>

3109
02:20:48.341 --> 02:20:48.341
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but other than that,</v>

3110
02:20:48.341 --> 02:20:50.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't rub your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get salt dries as a bad one,</v>

3111
02:20:50.390 --> 02:20:51.340
<v Speaker 4>but other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3112
02:20:51.341 --> 02:20:54.000
<v Speaker 4>you're experiencing no sound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3113
02:20:54.010 --> 02:20:57.440
<v Speaker 4>no visual input,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in the absence of that visual input,</v>

3114
02:20:57.441 --> 02:21:00.230
<v Speaker 4>I think all those other thoughts become </v>
<v Speaker 4>more powerful.</v>

3115
02:21:00.530 --> 02:21:05.530
<v Speaker 4>So whatever the effect of marijuana is </v>
<v Speaker 4>an irregular body when you're just </v>

3116
02:21:05.530 --> 02:21:06.530
<v Speaker 4>hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting around.</v>

3117
02:21:07.250 --> 02:21:12.250
<v Speaker 4>That effect is intensified in a big way </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're in the back and try that </v>

3118
02:21:13.041 --> 02:21:18.041
<v Speaker 4>next time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you're in town I can hook it </v>

3119
02:21:18.041 --> 02:21:18.041
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

3120
02:21:18.041 --> 02:21:18.041
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

3121
02:21:18.041 --> 02:21:18.041
<v Speaker 4>If you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many,</v>

3122
02:21:18.041 --> 02:21:18.260
<v Speaker 4>how many times are you in town for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long you in town?</v>

3123
02:21:18.261 --> 02:21:23.261
<v Speaker 4>For a we're on a hips so Thursday </v>
<v Speaker 4>evening and go to vegas to do a </v>

3124
02:21:23.261 --> 02:21:24.950
<v Speaker 4>competition that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they have them in Vegas too now.</v>

3125
02:21:25.010 --> 02:21:27.950
<v Speaker 4>They have everywhere to make.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I first started doing the tank,</v>

3126
02:21:28.010 --> 02:21:33.010
<v Speaker 4>I first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My first experience I think was in the </v>

3127
02:21:33.010 --> 02:21:35.681
<v Speaker 4>early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early two thousands and I got my first </v>

3128
02:21:35.681 --> 02:21:35.840
<v Speaker 4>tank in 2003 because when I bought my </v>
<v Speaker 4>house,</v>

3129
02:21:36.020 --> 02:21:39.050
<v Speaker 4>one of the reasons why I bought it is it</v>
<v Speaker 4>had a basement and I was like,</v>

3130
02:21:39.051 --> 02:21:42.740
<v Speaker 4>I want a place to put the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because I had done the tank a couple</v>

3131
02:21:42.741 --> 02:21:45.600
<v Speaker 4>of times at this place called soothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>solutions in Burbank.</v>

3132
02:21:45.620 --> 02:21:47.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've got it there and you can do it</v>

3133
02:21:47.001 --> 02:21:52.001
<v Speaker 4>every day then oh it's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll do it at night and I get home from </v>

3134
02:21:52.001 --> 02:21:55.331
<v Speaker 4>a comedy show and I'll say I need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>process my thoughts and go over my </v>

3135
02:21:55.331 --> 02:21:59.171
<v Speaker 4>material and I'll climb in that tank and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just take off to the center of the </v>

3136
02:21:59.171 --> 02:22:02.150
<v Speaker 4>universe and figure things out and also </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes me reconsider like how my thoughts</v>

3137
02:22:02.151 --> 02:22:02.240
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

3138
02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:04.960
<v Speaker 4>Be like one of the things about comedy </v>
<v Speaker 4>is you know,</v>

3139
02:22:05.060 --> 02:22:10.060
<v Speaker 4>you have an idea and you've got to try </v>
<v Speaker 4>to figure out a way to get that idea </v>

3140
02:22:10.060 --> 02:22:11.220
<v Speaker 4>into people's minds and sometimes it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the wrong way.</v>

3141
02:22:11.221 --> 02:22:15.170
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes it's too abrupt or too </v>
<v Speaker 4>corrosive or it's too,</v>

3142
02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:16.790
<v Speaker 4>it's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

3143
02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:20.020
<v Speaker 4>it's not smoothly getting into people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>minds,</v>

3144
02:22:20.021 --> 02:22:25.021
<v Speaker 4>so you have to like really consider it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that idea of seeing other people's </v>

3145
02:22:25.531 --> 02:22:27.930
<v Speaker 4>perspectives like that we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about earlier,</v>

3146
02:22:28.170 --> 02:22:33.170
<v Speaker 4>that's huge with standup comedy and one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the best ways to kind of get out of </v>

3147
02:22:33.170 --> 02:22:37.071
<v Speaker 4>your own way for me is to explore things</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the tank because in the absence of </v>

3148
02:22:37.071 --> 02:22:41.721
<v Speaker 4>any physical input,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he kind of stopped thinking of your body</v>

3149
02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:46.910
<v Speaker 4>and your brain and you as an individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>as like the captain of the ship and all </v>

3150
02:22:48.391 --> 02:22:51.300
<v Speaker 4>the other things start to become more </v>
<v Speaker 4>and more.</v>

3151
02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:56.710
<v Speaker 4>You've got more room to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the idea is like you and I </v>

3152
02:22:56.710 --> 02:23:00.441
<v Speaker 4>are having this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of the reasons why I like to do </v>

3153
02:23:00.441 --> 02:23:00.441
<v Speaker 4>it in this room with no one else here </v>
<v Speaker 4>but us.</v>

3154
02:23:00.441 --> 02:23:01.860
<v Speaker 4>So there's no distractions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3155
02:23:01.890 --> 02:23:03.990
<v Speaker 4>But if there was a guy in the other room</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a Jackhammer,</v>

3156
02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:06.180
<v Speaker 4>it would fuck us up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd want to get out of there.</v>

3157
02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:11.240
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want to it go over here so we can </v>

3158
02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:11.240
<v Speaker 4>talk more quietly in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to go to the gym?</v>

3159
02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:14.601
<v Speaker 4>You want to be sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why a lot of guys put headphones </v>

3160
02:23:14.601 --> 02:23:14.601
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3161
02:23:14.601 --> 02:23:14.970
<v Speaker 4>You just want to fucking grind and get </v>
<v Speaker 4>in your own head.</v>

3162
02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:18.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in life itself,</v>

3163
02:23:18.331 --> 02:23:23.331
<v Speaker 4>like while we're sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your chair is sending signals to your </v>

3164
02:23:23.331 --> 02:23:23.331
<v Speaker 4>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have your hands on the table.</v>

3165
02:23:23.331 --> 02:23:24.660
<v Speaker 4>It's all data in the tank.</v>

3166
02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:27.420
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in the absence of sensory input,</v>

3167
02:23:27.421 --> 02:23:32.421
<v Speaker 4>I believe that your brain become </v>
<v Speaker 4>supercharged and I think you can </v>

3168
02:23:32.421 --> 02:23:33.000
<v Speaker 4>consider things in a much more clear </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

3169
02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:35.340
<v Speaker 4>I think you have more resources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As I said,</v>

3170
02:23:35.550 --> 02:23:40.550
<v Speaker 4>I find the same with meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like when I've tried to explain to </v>

3171
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.550
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I said,</v>

3172
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:42.300
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like I feel like it's slowed</v>
<v Speaker 4>down my thought process.</v>

3173
02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:46.650
<v Speaker 4>So now when I have thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see them coming in and I'm like,</v>

3174
02:23:46.660 --> 02:23:51.660
<v Speaker 4>don't wanna act on this thought or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas before I already acted on it </v>

3175
02:23:51.660 --> 02:23:52.220
<v Speaker 4>before it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3176
02:23:52.221 --> 02:23:57.221
<v Speaker 4>I recognize that that's a huge problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>as being a reactionary person and </v>

3177
02:23:57.221 --> 02:24:01.760
<v Speaker 4>constantly dealing with input coming in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the like instinctively batting it </v>

3178
02:24:01.951 --> 02:24:06.840
<v Speaker 4>away or stay stressed and anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are always going to react like that.</v>

3179
02:24:06.841 --> 02:24:11.130
<v Speaker 4>So you need to get rid of all that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people know that.</v>

3180
02:24:11.140 --> 02:24:16.140
<v Speaker 4>I think that's one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 4>people have a real problem with </v>

3181
02:24:16.140 --> 02:24:18.711
<v Speaker 4>president trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the real problems we have with </v>

3182
02:24:18.711 --> 02:24:22.011
<v Speaker 4>them like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy that argues with people on </v>

3183
02:24:22.011 --> 02:24:22.100
<v Speaker 4>twitter gets mad and it was nail on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wwe.</v>

3184
02:24:22.510 --> 02:24:24.360
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't that perfect training to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>

3185
02:24:24.361 --> 02:24:26.550
<v Speaker 4>But that's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's silly to me.</v>

3186
02:24:26.551 --> 02:24:28.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3187
02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:32.280
<v Speaker 4>You're performing familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just what,</v>

3188
02:24:32.281 --> 02:24:33.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3189
02:24:33.930 --> 02:24:36.360
<v Speaker 4>the president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much power does it really have?</v>

3190
02:24:36.361 --> 02:24:41.361
<v Speaker 4>How much influence or is it just a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a pantomime that destruction for </v>

3191
02:24:41.361 --> 02:24:45.741
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that was before he was president </v>

3192
02:24:45.741 --> 02:24:46.680
<v Speaker 4>when I'm reacting to is like him </v>
<v Speaker 4>tweeting things today,</v>

3193
02:24:46.681 --> 02:24:49.020
<v Speaker 4>like shitting on people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>insulting people.</v>

3194
02:24:49.290 --> 02:24:52.410
<v Speaker 4>Like when you're the fucking president </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the United States,</v>

3195
02:24:52.411 --> 02:24:57.411
<v Speaker 4>he the leader of the free world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't be going on twitter and just </v>

3196
02:24:57.411 --> 02:24:59.790
<v Speaker 4>insulting people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting out that conflict energy that we</v>

3197
02:24:59.791 --> 02:25:03.300
<v Speaker 4>were talking about for what reason?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If people recognize whether they know it</v>

3198
02:25:03.301 --> 02:25:08.301
<v Speaker 4>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inherently they know that this is not </v>

3199
02:25:08.301 --> 02:25:09.090
<v Speaker 4>the way to lead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not the way to be above it all.</v>

3200
02:25:09.091 --> 02:25:12.150
<v Speaker 4>This is not the wise person that we want</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the top of the hill.</v>

3201
02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:14.640
<v Speaker 4>Setting the standards for all the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>who have a.</v>

3202
02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:19.050
<v Speaker 4>which was your alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no alternative,</v>

3203
02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:24.400
<v Speaker 4>but you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there should be a </v>

3204
02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:24.400
<v Speaker 4>president and I've said this a million </v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

3205
02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:24.400
<v Speaker 4>I just think there's too much power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does</v>

3206
02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:25.960
<v Speaker 1>the president really have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you had to Obama,</v>

3207
02:25:25.961 --> 02:25:30.961
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it was going to close down </v>

3208
02:25:30.961 --> 02:25:30.961
<v Speaker 1>Guantanamo Bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3209
02:25:30.961 --> 02:25:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it didn't happen.</v>

3210
02:25:31.570 --> 02:25:33.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know why did he want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

3211
02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:38.400
<v Speaker 1>but he couldn't because other people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really in control or maybe they want to </v>

3212
02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:38.400
<v Speaker 1>do</v>

3213
02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:38.400
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3214
02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:38.840
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They shouldn't do it.</v>

3215
02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:42.440
<v Speaker 4>There couldn't be a bunch of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3216
02:25:42.630 --> 02:25:44.880
<v Speaker 1>but I think maybe you go there with good</v>
<v Speaker 1>intentions,</v>

3217
02:25:44.881 --> 02:25:48.250
<v Speaker 1>but there's other people that pull us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull the strings and you know,</v>

3218
02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:49.620
<v Speaker 1>presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a front guy</v>

3219
02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:54.920
<v Speaker 4>in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things about trump being so </v>

3220
02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:57.090
<v Speaker 4>bold and so egotistical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's probably a positive,</v>

3221
02:25:57.091 --> 02:26:02.091
<v Speaker 4>is that he's resisting the deep state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's resisting all of these other </v>

3222
02:26:02.091 --> 02:26:06.381
<v Speaker 4>outside influences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any so wealthy that he has the financial</v>

3223
02:26:06.571 --> 02:26:11.571
<v Speaker 4>power to insulate himself from these </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people that are like him.</v>

3224
02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3225
02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:14.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got friends in the states and that was</v>

3226
02:26:14.751 --> 02:26:16.120
<v Speaker 1>the feedback that I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3227
02:26:16.140 --> 02:26:21.140
<v Speaker 1>the guys that liked trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they liked him because I felt that it </v>

3228
02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:21.140
<v Speaker 1>wasn't gonna be controlled by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3229
02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:22.240
<v Speaker 1>the big money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3230
02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:27.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys that own the Federal Reserve </v>

3231
02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:29.681
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or pulling the strings on the military </v>

3232
02:26:29.681 --> 02:26:29.681
<v Speaker 1>and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>

3233
02:26:29.681 --> 02:26:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can beat those guys,</v>

3234
02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:34.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>control the money system,</v>

3235
02:26:34.431 --> 02:26:35.300
<v Speaker 1>the control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

3236
02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:37.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I like your idea.</v>

3237
02:26:37.821 --> 02:26:38.960
<v Speaker 1>We need to get them all fucked up.</v>

3238
02:26:39.700 --> 02:26:43.120
<v Speaker 3>So let's get hillary stoned and make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>real nice,</v>

3239
02:26:43.121 --> 02:26:44.500
<v Speaker 3>cool lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she would just go,</v>

3240
02:26:44.501 --> 02:26:49.501
<v Speaker 3>I have cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I confess is a picture of a deer that </v>

3241
02:26:53.291 --> 02:26:55.180
<v Speaker 3>was on the side of the road that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>

3242
02:26:55.300 --> 02:26:57.250
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those one of those comic memes.</v>

3243
02:26:57.600 --> 02:26:59.590
<v Speaker 3>And it said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did this deer know about?</v>

3244
02:26:59.591 --> 02:27:04.591
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton seems to be dangerous to</v>
<v Speaker 3>know too much about Hillary and Bill </v>

3245
02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:10.920
<v Speaker 3>Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were killed just in the last </v>

3246
02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:11.860
<v Speaker 3>couple of weeks that committed suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people know this shit,</v>

3247
02:27:11.861 --> 02:27:12.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

3248
02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:17.590
<v Speaker 1>we've got this fucking psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we've got this idiot guy that but </v>

3249
02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:20.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe is a better alternative than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopath.</v>

3250
02:27:20.511 --> 02:27:25.160
<v Speaker 1>So let's go with the orange guy with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>orange guy because he's,</v>

3251
02:27:25.220 --> 02:27:27.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his not part of this cabal.</v>

3252
02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:30.500
<v Speaker 1>And maybe he's gonna he's gonna change </v>
<v Speaker 1>things for the better.</v>

3253
02:27:30.501 --> 02:27:35.501
<v Speaker 1>So that's why people went with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe because he was seen to be not </v>

3254
02:27:36.501 --> 02:27:40.070
<v Speaker 1>controlled by the same forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like the,</v>

3255
02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:40.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Clintons,</v>

3256
02:27:40.911 --> 02:27:42.020
<v Speaker 1>the bushes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking,</v>

3257
02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:44.000
<v Speaker 1>all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on the same club.</v>

3258
02:27:44.001 --> 02:27:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3259
02:27:44.540 --> 02:27:46.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just seems that change,</v>

3260
02:27:46.220 --> 02:27:48.830
<v Speaker 4>especially change over our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3261
02:27:48.860 --> 02:27:53.860
<v Speaker 4>over a civilization happens in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>like slow ticks to the right or ticks to</v>

3262
02:27:54.201 --> 02:27:59.201
<v Speaker 4>the left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>moving in a good direction or a bad </v>

3263
02:27:59.201 --> 02:28:01.560
<v Speaker 4>direction is so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so slow to change and like,</v>

3264
02:28:01.610 --> 02:28:05.840
<v Speaker 4>so when something like this comes around</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is perceived to be a negative thing</v>

3265
02:28:06.170 --> 02:28:10.160
<v Speaker 4>and it's perceived to be a negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing moving in a terrible direction and</v>

3266
02:28:10.250 --> 02:28:12.680
<v Speaker 4>quite rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It scares the shit out of people.</v>

3267
02:28:13.170 --> 02:28:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the feedback I get now.</v>

3268
02:28:15.521 --> 02:28:16.680
<v Speaker 1>If people over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3269
02:28:16.750 --> 02:28:17.780
<v Speaker 1>they're concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3270
02:28:18.850 --> 02:28:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Well of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it makes that much who is </v>

3271
02:28:23.850 --> 02:28:23.850
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a,</v>

3272
02:28:23.850 --> 02:28:27.410
<v Speaker 1>it's just a fucking side show to </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertain people came distracted.</v>

3273
02:28:27.910 --> 02:28:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's on purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got all.</v>

3274
02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that old emotional like,</v>

3275
02:28:31.010 --> 02:28:32.070
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump is a,</v>

3276
02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:37.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's just bullshit is a </v>

3277
02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:39.980
<v Speaker 1>pantone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mine is just to keep you distracted and </v>

3278
02:28:39.980 --> 02:28:40.550
<v Speaker 1>I keep you entertained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like football and everything else,</v>

3279
02:28:40.551 --> 02:28:42.710
<v Speaker 1>like don't look over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look over here.</v>

3280
02:28:42.740 --> 02:28:43.830
<v Speaker 1>So magicians trick in.</v>

3281
02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:46.720
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

3282
02:28:47.170 --> 02:28:52.170
<v Speaker 4>I like to think that way sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then other times I think it's probably </v>

3283
02:28:52.170 --> 02:28:55.351
<v Speaker 4>just too complicated for anybody to </v>
<v Speaker 4>really orchestrate and we're just </v>

3284
02:28:55.351 --> 02:28:58.471
<v Speaker 4>reacting to these wants and needs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>human instincts and all a variety of </v>

3285
02:28:58.871 --> 02:29:03.871
<v Speaker 4>factors that have been set in motion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the momentum of these things that </v>

3286
02:29:03.871 --> 02:29:07.741
<v Speaker 4>have been set in motion forever and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people trying to profit and people </v>

3287
02:29:07.741 --> 02:29:07.741
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out how to control </v>
<v Speaker 4>various factions of it,</v>

3288
02:29:07.741 --> 02:29:11.410
<v Speaker 4>but the idea of like one person or one </v>
<v Speaker 4>group pulling the strings,</v>

3289
02:29:11.950 --> 02:29:15.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not as clear cut as that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I find it less and less plausible.</v>

3290
02:29:15.490 --> 02:29:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a small group that controls </v>

3291
02:29:20.490 --> 02:29:20.490
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The debt.</v>

3292
02:29:20.580 --> 02:29:25.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not even money instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if your control that then it can </v>

3293
02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:26.500
<v Speaker 1>control pretty much everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3294
02:29:26.610 --> 02:29:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Isn't everybody in debt is every country</v>
<v Speaker 1>in debt is in China in debt to.</v>

3295
02:29:30.050 --> 02:29:31.270
<v Speaker 1>So who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3296
02:29:31.610 --> 02:29:36.610
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If everybody is in debt to everybody,</v>

3297
02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:42.120
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that really dead fucking front money </v>

3298
02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:42.240
<v Speaker 1>and put a number on a thing and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3299
02:29:42.580 --> 02:29:45.130
<v Speaker 1>you owe us x amount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just cancel a debt.</v>

3300
02:29:45.580 --> 02:29:46.120
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3301
02:29:46.770 --> 02:29:51.770
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why they distracted with things </v>

3302
02:29:51.770 --> 02:29:51.780
<v Speaker 4>like we've got to go after medical </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana like that jeff sessions guy.</v>

3303
02:29:52.220 --> 02:29:54.090
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the ultimate distraction.</v>

3304
02:29:54.720 --> 02:29:57.930
<v Speaker 1>It's going to start crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of versus like,</v>

3305
02:29:58.530 --> 02:30:03.530
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge thing in the evolution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and it's getting more </v>

3306
02:30:03.530 --> 02:30:06.990
<v Speaker 1>available and more accepted and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so many layers to it,</v>

3307
02:30:06.991 --> 02:30:08.850
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like medically,</v>

3308
02:30:09.390 --> 02:30:11.220
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spiritually.</v>

3309
02:30:11.221 --> 02:30:14.000
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hemp plant.</v>

3310
02:30:14.001 --> 02:30:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Can fucking supply what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry Ford built the model t ford out of</v>

3311
02:30:18.610 --> 02:30:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Hamp Hempcrete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3312
02:30:20.370 --> 02:30:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way stronger.</v>

3313
02:30:22.300 --> 02:30:26.010
<v Speaker 1>So why is it with a hammer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hits the fenders and rust.</v>

3314
02:30:26.100 --> 02:30:28.080
<v Speaker 1>It's lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3315
02:30:28.081 --> 02:30:30.420
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He filled it with ethanol as well.</v>

3316
02:30:30.450 --> 02:30:31.630
<v Speaker 1>So did you ever see you see</v>

3317
02:30:31.630 --> 02:30:36.010
<v Speaker 4>them make that a video where they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>him hit the hammer against the offender?</v>

3318
02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:39.800
<v Speaker 4>It's like the first model t they had met</v>
<v Speaker 4>fenders.</v>

3319
02:30:39.860 --> 02:30:44.860
<v Speaker 4>They had made them out of hemp and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>whacking it with a fucking hammer and </v>

3320
02:30:44.920 --> 02:30:49.920
<v Speaker 4>hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people don't understand if you've </v>

3321
02:30:49.920 --> 02:30:52.081
<v Speaker 4>never experienced it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hemp stalk the actual stock of the </v>

3322
02:30:52.081 --> 02:30:55.471
<v Speaker 4>tree itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll get very big and thick and it's </v>

3323
02:30:55.471 --> 02:30:57.100
<v Speaker 4>extremely hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but extremely light.</v>

3324
02:30:57.130 --> 02:31:00.270
<v Speaker 4>It's not like any other wood is light </v>
<v Speaker 4>light wiring.</v>

3325
02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:04.450
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking hard like oak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but light like Balsa Wood.</v>

3326
02:31:04.451 --> 02:31:06.010
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is hemp.</v>

3327
02:31:06.220 --> 02:31:11.220
<v Speaker 4>So he's banging his hammer against this </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking car and it's not even making a </v>

3328
02:31:11.831 --> 02:31:16.831
<v Speaker 4>dent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So tell me why it didn't build the car </v>

3329
02:31:16.831 --> 02:31:16.960
<v Speaker 4>out of because of William Randolph </v>
<v Speaker 4>hearst.</v>

3330
02:31:16.961 --> 02:31:21.961
<v Speaker 4>That fucking cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>William Randolph was the guy who owned </v>

3331
02:31:21.961 --> 02:31:24.060
<v Speaker 4>hearst publications.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He also owned a bunch of paper mills and</v>

3332
02:31:24.061 --> 02:31:26.070
<v Speaker 4>he's the guy who demonized him.</v>

3333
02:31:26.100 --> 02:31:31.100
<v Speaker 4>He's also the guy that was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivation for Orson Wells to make the </v>

3334
02:31:31.100 --> 02:31:33.750
<v Speaker 4>movie Rosebud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are the movie citizen Kane Rather.</v>

3335
02:31:33.751 --> 02:31:37.770
<v Speaker 4>He was in the oil and steel industries </v>
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>

3336
02:31:37.800 --> 02:31:42.800
<v Speaker 4>It has to do with a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a big part of it was William </v>

3337
02:31:42.800 --> 02:31:46.310
<v Speaker 4>Randolph hearst because they had a cover</v>
<v Speaker 4>of popular science magazine that was </v>

3338
02:31:46.310 --> 02:31:49.851
<v Speaker 4>like hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The new billion dollar crop and they </v>

3339
02:31:49.851 --> 02:31:52.821
<v Speaker 4>made that because there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a device that was invented </v>

3340
02:31:52.821 --> 02:31:54.900
<v Speaker 4>called the decorticator and what a </v>
<v Speaker 4>decorticator was.</v>

3341
02:31:54.901 --> 02:31:59.901
<v Speaker 4>It was a machine that allowed you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>effectively process the hemp fiber </v>

3342
02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:02.370
<v Speaker 4>without the use of slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

3343
02:32:02.371 --> 02:32:07.371
<v Speaker 4>for years and years they had used </v>
<v Speaker 4>slavery to process hemp and hemp was </v>

3344
02:32:07.371 --> 02:32:11.481
<v Speaker 4>what they used for canvas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I can have the name canvas </v>

3345
02:32:11.481 --> 02:32:11.680
<v Speaker 4>comes from the word cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

3346
02:32:11.720 --> 02:32:15.180
<v Speaker 4>That's literally Lamont.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wrote the declaration of independence</v>

3347
02:32:15.181 --> 02:32:17.580
<v Speaker 4>on him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the first drafts on hemp paper,</v>

3348
02:32:17.581 --> 02:32:18.990
<v Speaker 4>it's a far superior paper.</v>

3349
02:32:19.350 --> 02:32:21.330
<v Speaker 4>Then wood pulp paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3350
02:32:21.331 --> 02:32:24.840
<v Speaker 4>when they had come out with this article</v>
<v Speaker 4>in popular science magazine,</v>

3351
02:32:24.841 --> 02:32:26.280
<v Speaker 4>hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the new billion dollar crop,</v>

3352
02:32:26.520 --> 02:32:31.520
<v Speaker 4>they were essentially saying that hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the decorticator now hemp </v>

3353
02:32:31.520 --> 02:32:33.270
<v Speaker 4>would replace Wood for paper for all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these other things,</v>

3354
02:32:33.271 --> 02:32:35.280
<v Speaker 4>so I don't need to destroy the forest </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>

3355
02:32:35.490 --> 02:32:39.390
<v Speaker 4>William Randolf hearst not only owned </v>
<v Speaker 4>these newspapers,</v>

3356
02:32:39.391 --> 02:32:44.391
<v Speaker 4>but he also owned these paper mills and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he owned these forests and he decided to</v>

3357
02:32:46.590 --> 02:32:50.160
<v Speaker 4>combat this competing industry with </v>
<v Speaker 4>propaganda.</v>

3358
02:32:50.340 --> 02:32:55.340
<v Speaker 4>So they started printing these stories </v>
<v Speaker 4>about how these black people and </v>

3359
02:32:55.340 --> 02:32:57.990
<v Speaker 4>Mexicans were taking this wild drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana women.</v>

3360
02:32:58.020 --> 02:33:00.300
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then everybody was like Jesus.</v>

3361
02:33:00.360 --> 02:33:03.030
<v Speaker 4>So when the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When Congress first made marijuana,</v>

3362
02:33:03.060 --> 02:33:08.060
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana was not even the word for </v>

3363
02:33:08.060 --> 02:33:11.331
<v Speaker 4>cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana was a word for a wild Mexican </v>

3364
02:33:11.331 --> 02:33:12.600
<v Speaker 4>tobacco that had nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As Mexican.</v>

3365
02:33:12.750 --> 02:33:15.960
<v Speaker 4>It was the exactly careful danger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>danger to the cross,</v>

3366
02:33:15.961 --> 02:33:17.410
<v Speaker 4>the border around ones.</v>

3367
02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:21.960
<v Speaker 4>And so they people responded to this and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3368
02:33:22.110 --> 02:33:27.110
<v Speaker 4>when they made it illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't even understand that they </v>

3369
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.110
<v Speaker 4>were making cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't notice to understand.</v>

3370
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:31.071
<v Speaker 4>They were making the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the commodity hemp illegal like to this </v>

3371
02:33:31.071 --> 02:33:34.020
<v Speaker 4>day until recently on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We sell hemp protein.</v>

3372
02:33:34.170 --> 02:33:37.110
<v Speaker 4>When we first started on it several </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>

3373
02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:42.320
<v Speaker 4>we had to buy all of our hemp from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada because even though it's not </v>

3374
02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:44.520
<v Speaker 4>psychoactive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was illegal still to grow in America.</v>

3375
02:33:45.140 --> 02:33:48.240
<v Speaker 4>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just so tied,</v>

3376
02:33:48.241 --> 02:33:50.220
<v Speaker 4>technically stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

3377
02:33:50.221 --> 02:33:52.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

3378
02:33:52.081 --> 02:33:55.170
<v Speaker 4>there's a crack in the dam now that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of stop it,</v>

3379
02:33:55.171 --> 02:33:58.370
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That bowl was rolling now and people are</v>

3380
02:33:58.530 --> 02:34:00.240
<v Speaker 4>waking up to the benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3381
02:34:00.250 --> 02:34:05.250
<v Speaker 4>how many states you're gotten in us now </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's legal is quite a few medical and </v>

3382
02:34:05.250 --> 02:34:08.790
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it like nine recreational,</v>

3383
02:34:08.791 --> 02:34:10.470
<v Speaker 4>Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Massachusetts,</v>

3384
02:34:10.471 --> 02:34:12.030
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oregon,</v>

3385
02:34:12.031 --> 02:34:15.480
<v Speaker 4>Washington state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Washington,</v>

3386
02:34:15.481 --> 02:34:17.500
<v Speaker 4>DC that I say that already.</v>

3387
02:34:17.970 --> 02:34:21.940
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3388
02:34:21.941 --> 02:34:26.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean the other ones there are main </v>
<v Speaker 4>Alaska,</v>

3389
02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:28.420
<v Speaker 4>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

3390
02:34:28.930 --> 02:34:31.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how many of them legalized canvas?</v>

3391
02:34:31.691 --> 02:34:32.320
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>

3392
02:34:32.321 --> 02:34:32.860
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four,</v>

3393
02:34:32.861 --> 02:34:34.150
<v Speaker 4>five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six,</v>

3394
02:34:34.151 --> 02:34:35.380
<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>

3395
02:34:35.381 --> 02:34:40.381
<v Speaker 4>legalized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then jurisdiction with medical </v>

3396
02:34:40.381 --> 02:34:40.570
<v Speaker 4>decriminalization that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>funky,</v>

3397
02:34:40.571 --> 02:34:45.571
<v Speaker 4>weird shades too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's more than three shades </v>

3398
02:34:45.571 --> 02:34:48.640
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just make it illegal across the </v>

3399
02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:48.640
<v Speaker 4>board.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3400
02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:49.330
<v Speaker 4>it takes time,</v>

3401
02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:54.600
<v Speaker 4>The amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's fascinating is the amount of </v>

3402
02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:56.731
<v Speaker 4>money that is coming in and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>affecting it because these people are </v>

3403
02:34:56.731 --> 02:34:58.630
<v Speaker 4>getting into Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The was massive.</v>

3404
02:34:58.740 --> 02:35:02.590
<v Speaker 4>Put it back into the school systems and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the metal giving people tax refunds.</v>

3405
02:35:02.650 --> 02:35:07.650
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we made too much money tax at 39 </v>

3406
02:35:07.650 --> 02:35:07.650
<v Speaker 4>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody's like,</v>

3407
02:35:07.650 --> 02:35:08.710
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody gives a shit.</v>

3408
02:35:09.300 --> 02:35:10.780
<v Speaker 4>I read that in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Nevada,</v>

3409
02:35:10.781 --> 02:35:12.850
<v Speaker 4>in vegas that literally running out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3410
02:35:13.460 --> 02:35:14.050
<v Speaker 4>Urgency.</v>

3412
02:35:17.350 --> 02:35:22.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I hope not because I'm going there </v>

3413
02:35:22.350 --> 02:35:22.350
<v Speaker 4>Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3414
02:35:22.350 --> 02:35:22.350

<v Speaker 4>I'll hook it up.</v>

3415
02:35:22.350 --> 02:35:26.100
<v Speaker 4>I know people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nevada declares marijuana state of </v>

3416
02:35:26.100 --> 02:35:28.591
<v Speaker 4>emergency to avoid $100,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>tax shortfall because they wanted the </v>

3417
02:35:28.591 --> 02:35:33.091
<v Speaker 4>money from the marijuana because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were making so much money in taxes </v>

3418
02:35:33.091 --> 02:35:34.780
<v Speaker 4>because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Nevada has 39 percent as well,</v>

3419
02:35:34.781 --> 02:35:36.880
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a 39 percent tax rate.</v>

3420
02:35:36.940 --> 02:35:39.670
<v Speaker 4>If it's 15 for recreational,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only 15.</v>

3421
02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:41.300
<v Speaker 4>Really think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3422
02:35:41.301 --> 02:35:42.910
<v Speaker 4>they fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should've went 39.</v>

3423
02:35:42.940 --> 02:35:47.940
<v Speaker 4>Nobody gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's still five bucks for when you're </v>

3424
02:35:47.940 --> 02:35:47.940
<v Speaker 4>buying it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if this,</v>

3425
02:35:47.940 --> 02:35:48.460
<v Speaker 4>the works are getting texts too for what</v>
<v Speaker 4>they sell.</v>

3426
02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:50.240
<v Speaker 4>Recreational marijuana tax</v>

3427
02:35:50.330 --> 02:35:52.600
<v Speaker 1>fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bowl was all in as not going to stop</v>

3428
02:35:52.601 --> 02:35:53.470
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3429
02:35:54.340 --> 02:35:59.340
<v Speaker 1>so many people out there have cured </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer as well about using the </v>

3430
02:35:59.340 --> 02:36:02.671
<v Speaker 1>concentrated oil and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a couple of friends that have </v>

3431
02:36:02.671 --> 02:36:03.550
<v Speaker 1>cured their own concept from changing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Diet,</v>

3432
02:36:04.430 --> 02:36:09.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into a plant based alkaline diet and </v>

3433
02:36:09.430 --> 02:36:10.660
<v Speaker 1>taking the cannabis oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the doctors are like baffled.</v>

3434
02:36:10.810 --> 02:36:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that.</v>

3435
02:36:13.210 --> 02:36:15.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's a powerful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If somebody kills a concert,</v>

3436
02:36:15.371 --> 02:36:20.371
<v Speaker 1>they're going to tell everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell everybody they know all their </v>

3437
02:36:20.371 --> 02:36:20.540
<v Speaker 1>family and it's just a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3438
02:36:20.910 --> 02:36:24.370
<v Speaker 1>They just had something on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a mainstream,</v>

3439
02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:29.400
<v Speaker 1>which I was surprised a mainstream a </v>
<v Speaker 1>news show in England where they had this</v>

3440
02:36:30.131 --> 02:36:32.440
<v Speaker 1>case of this kid who was in hospital is </v>
<v Speaker 1>dying from.</v>

3441
02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Can't remember what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

3442
02:36:34.031 --> 02:36:39.031
<v Speaker 1>just the point is his mother was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sneaking in the cannabis oil and he got </v>

3443
02:36:39.761 --> 02:36:44.761
<v Speaker 1>cured for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they did this whole thing on </v>

3444
02:36:44.761 --> 02:36:44.761
<v Speaker 1>the breakfast tv about how the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3445
02:36:44.761 --> 02:36:48.790
<v Speaker 1>the kitchen was got rid of his constant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what I noticed,</v>

3446
02:36:48.791 --> 02:36:50.410
<v Speaker 1>they still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3447
02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:53.320
<v Speaker 1>the obviously told to say this or that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3448
02:36:53.321 --> 02:36:55.300
<v Speaker 1>there's told this whole story about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid is like,</v>

3449
02:36:55.390 --> 02:37:00.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of gone now because his mom </v>

3450
02:37:00.390 --> 02:37:00.390
<v Speaker 1>was sneaking in the cannabis oil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3451
02:37:00.390 --> 02:37:00.610
<v Speaker 1>we need to look into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3452
02:37:01.150 --> 02:37:02.950
<v Speaker 1>but we must state everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

3453
02:37:03.130 --> 02:37:05.920
<v Speaker 1>we must tell you that we must,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3454
02:37:06.250 --> 02:37:07.420
<v Speaker 1>it's not a cure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3455
02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:13.120
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck you're talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The kids killed while you're talking </v>

3456
02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:13.120
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a cure,</v>

3457
02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:14.060
<v Speaker 4>but it's obviously something they've got</v>
<v Speaker 4>to state,</v>

3458
02:37:14.450 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's actually illegal to</v>

3459
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:18.170
<v Speaker 3>claim that you can cure cancer.</v>

3460
02:37:18.260 --> 02:37:20.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's illegal to possess the marijuana,</v>

3461
02:37:20.691 --> 02:37:25.691
<v Speaker 2>so it's illegal probably to use it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment even though it's effective,</v>

3462
02:37:25.701 --> 02:37:27.740
<v Speaker 2>you have to say it's not a cure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3463
02:37:27.780 --> 02:37:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Under the influence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical drug companies that will </v>

3464
02:37:32.780 --> 02:37:35.591
<v Speaker 2>come down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's pharmaceutical drug </v>

3465
02:37:35.591 --> 02:37:35.591
<v Speaker 2>companies that advertise on these </v>
<v Speaker 2>networks,</v>

3466
02:37:35.591 --> 02:37:40.090
<v Speaker 2>which becomes a huge problem because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their advertising abilify and fucking </v>

3467
02:37:40.090 --> 02:37:42.560
<v Speaker 2>Welbutrin and all this different shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're selling.</v>

3468
02:37:43.010 --> 02:37:48.010
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to be interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>you telling positive stories about </v>

3469
02:37:48.010 --> 02:37:50.030
<v Speaker 2>abandoning all pharmaceutical drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then taking natural remedies,</v>

3470
02:37:50.100 --> 02:37:53.730
<v Speaker 3>of course not as competent it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what they're trying to do now is make</v>

3471
02:37:54.170 --> 02:37:59.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly different versions of it that </v>

3472
02:37:59.170 --> 02:38:02.101
<v Speaker 3>the complaintant a swan company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at Gw pharmaceuticals and UK.</v>

3473
02:38:02.850 --> 02:38:03.480
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess what?</v>

3474
02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:06.360
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't fucking work when you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3475
02:38:06.450 --> 02:38:11.450
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm laughing at them and waste all </v>

3476
02:38:11.450 --> 02:38:11.450
<v Speaker 3>your fucking money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The plant is perfect as it is,</v>

3477
02:38:11.450 --> 02:38:14.550
<v Speaker 3>as a perfect balance is it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It works as it is,</v>

3478
02:38:14.551 --> 02:38:19.551
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can't trademark you trademark </v>

3479
02:38:19.551 --> 02:38:19.551
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you want to change it a little bit to</v>

3480
02:38:19.551 --> 02:38:21.180
<v Speaker 3>create something can trademark and make </v>
<v Speaker 3>tons of profit off.</v>

3481
02:38:21.181 --> 02:38:23.550
<v Speaker 3>But guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it ain't working.</v>

3482
02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:24.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you.</v>

3483
02:38:24.750 --> 02:38:26.850
<v Speaker 3>Once you change it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't work the way it's supposed to</v>

3484
02:38:26.851 --> 02:38:27.090
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

3485
02:38:27.650 --> 02:38:30.020
<v Speaker 2>It's all people trying to control shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3486
02:38:30.021 --> 02:38:34.370
<v Speaker 2>it's people that are trying to control </v>
<v Speaker 2>how much agriculture you could sell.</v>

3487
02:38:34.600 --> 02:38:39.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's agriculture with marijuana really </v>

3488
02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:42.491
<v Speaker 2>is a psychoactive agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's plants like the idea that you tell </v>

3489
02:38:42.491 --> 02:38:43.000
<v Speaker 2>someone they can't grow tomatoes</v>

3490
02:38:43.010 --> 02:38:45.260
<v Speaker 3>in their backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking bananas close.</v>

3491
02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:49.280
<v Speaker 3>It's a plant that grows from the ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly as it is.</v>

3492
02:38:49.490 --> 02:38:51.560
<v Speaker 3>God fucking made plant grows from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

3493
02:38:51.561 --> 02:38:52.820

<v Speaker 3>How can that be illegal?</v>

3494
02:38:52.910 --> 02:38:53.080
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3495
02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:55.180
<v Speaker 2>So if you have tomatoes in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>backyard,</v>

3496
02:38:55.181 --> 02:39:00.181
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows tomatoes have lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamins are healthy for you and you </v>

02:40:39.521 --> 02:40:42.010
<v Speaker 1>arthritis is really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must spend a ton of pain.</v>

3542
02:40:42.011 --> 02:40:43.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

3543
02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:48.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's down to my kind </v>

3544
02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:48.960
<v Speaker 1>of issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it definitely,</v>

3545
02:40:49.390 --> 02:40:50.890
<v Speaker 1>definitely a factor in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3546
02:40:51.310 --> 02:40:56.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think also a factor is mental </v>

3547
02:40:56.310 --> 02:40:59.131
<v Speaker 2>toughness because of the fact that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your understanding of pain is probably </v>

3548
02:40:59.131 --> 02:40:59.131
<v Speaker 2>way different than that.</v>

3549
02:40:59.131 --> 02:41:00.850
<v Speaker 1>How you perceive pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3550
02:41:00.851 --> 02:41:04.570
<v Speaker 1>like you're not going to dwell on it the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that advertising is not a big deal.</v>

3551
02:41:04.580 --> 02:41:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live with that every day from,</v>

3552
02:41:06.410 --> 02:41:11.410
<v Speaker 1>from training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually look forward to it in a </v>

3553
02:41:11.410 --> 02:41:11.410
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3554
02:41:11.410 --> 02:41:11.710
<v Speaker 1>So probably my perception of pain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3555
02:41:12.470 --> 02:41:14.800
<v Speaker 1>is less than everybody else's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for sure,</v>

3556
02:41:14.940 --> 02:41:16.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm asleep,</v>

3557
02:41:16.001 --> 02:41:18.040
<v Speaker 1>if you had to reel arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's going to wait.</v>

3558
02:41:18.070 --> 02:41:19.600
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get anything.</v>

3559
02:41:19.630 --> 02:41:23.060
<v Speaker 1>So something I'm doing is helping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3560
02:41:23.860 --> 02:41:25.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider cannabis to,</v>

3561
02:41:25.211 --> 02:41:27.610
<v Speaker 1>they'd be the most powerful health </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement you can take.</v>

3562
02:41:28.540 --> 02:41:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm better than all the other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still take all the other stuff as </v>

3563
02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:34.720
<v Speaker 1>well because I'm stuck in all the odds </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my favor,</v>

3564
02:41:34.721 --> 02:41:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3565
02:41:35.270 --> 02:41:40.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think it's really important </v>

3566
02:41:40.270 --> 02:41:41.020
<v Speaker 2>guys like you that are going against the</v>
<v Speaker 2>grain explaining your position and,</v>

3567
02:41:41.050 --> 02:41:46.050
<v Speaker 2>and also you as a respected professional</v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete where people will listen to you </v>

3568
02:41:46.461 --> 02:41:46.940
<v Speaker 2>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3569
02:41:46.941 --> 02:41:51.941
<v Speaker 2>well this guy is such a straight shooter</v>
<v Speaker 2>about steroids and about training and </v>

3570
02:41:51.941 --> 02:41:52.580
<v Speaker 2>about injuries and all these other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

3571
02:41:52.970 --> 02:41:54.260
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to lie about this.</v>

3572
02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people have just been had this </v>

3573
02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:01.440
<v Speaker 1>misinformation for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so strong in that brain is like,</v>

3574
02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:04.870
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a change that you know,</v>

3575
02:42:04.871 --> 02:42:07.060
<v Speaker 1>especially if you don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience with a soft,</v>

3576
02:42:07.090 --> 02:42:12.090
<v Speaker 1>like this fucking drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I dunno if somebody put on the </v>

3577
02:42:12.090 --> 02:42:13.870
<v Speaker 1>instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you ate smokes weed.</v>

3578
02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:16.270
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking hate lazy stoners.</v>

3579
02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:22.680
<v Speaker 3>That's a pretty strong reaction man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you hate somebody because they're </v>

3580
02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:27.041
<v Speaker 3>smoking a fucking lazy calling you lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>

3581
02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:33.400
<v Speaker 3>It's like an ally that I need to smoke </v>
<v Speaker 3>weed to stop me from doing too much </v>

3582
02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:35.170
<v Speaker 3>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a slow me down.</v>

3583
02:42:35.190 --> 02:42:38.130
<v Speaker 3>So like a normal level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why listen yet</v>

3584
02:42:38.220 --> 02:42:43.220
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can fucking slow you down and you </v>

3585
02:42:43.220 --> 02:42:46.000
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sit and smoke fucking weed all </v>

3586
02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:47.900
<v Speaker 1>day and sitting in the couch and watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>TV and eat pizzas if you want like you </v>

3587
02:42:47.900 --> 02:42:51.000
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're smart you use it when it's</v>

3588
02:42:51.020 --> 02:42:52.830
<v Speaker 1>the time to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like,</v>

3589
02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:58.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I like to smoke a little bit </v>

3590
02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.480
<v Speaker 1>of cardio because it opens my broncos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get a better fucking will count or</v>

3591
02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:05.550
<v Speaker 1>it's generally in the evening when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxing or if I want to do something </v>

3592
02:43:05.550 --> 02:43:08.460
<v Speaker 1>creative like I'm writing or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps me like think a little bit,</v>

3593
02:43:08.730 --> 02:43:13.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there will be times when it's </v>

3594
02:43:13.730 --> 02:43:13.730
<v Speaker 1>appropriate and times when it's not</v>

3595
02:43:13.730 --> 02:43:13.850
<v Speaker 2>appropriate and that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3596
02:43:14.250 --> 02:43:15.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree.</v>

3597
02:43:15.970 --> 02:43:20.970
<v Speaker 2>I just think that it's a lot like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about earlier with fats </v>

3598
02:43:20.970 --> 02:43:24.391
<v Speaker 2>and sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's this misinformation that </v>

3599
02:43:24.391 --> 02:43:27.241
<v Speaker 2>continues forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like once you get an idea in your </v>

3600
02:43:27.241 --> 02:43:27.241
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3601
02:43:27.241 --> 02:43:28.300
<v Speaker 2>low fat is good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high fat is bad,</v>

3602
02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:31.720
<v Speaker 2>and then somewhere along the line you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that that's bullshit.</v>

3603
02:43:31.721 --> 02:43:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Like what you might realize that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might do the research,</v>

3604
02:43:34.541 --> 02:43:37.150
<v Speaker 2>you might go into the article and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the studies and go,</v>

3605
02:43:37.151 --> 02:43:38.230
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is insane.</v>

3606
02:43:38.231 --> 02:43:43.231
<v Speaker 2>And how did this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And go into the New York Times article </v>

3607
02:43:43.231 --> 02:43:43.231
<v Speaker 2>about the sugar industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bing.</v>

3608
02:43:43.231 --> 02:43:45.370
<v Speaker 2>But once you get to a certain point in </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

3609
02:43:46.150 --> 02:43:50.320
<v Speaker 2>you realize like most people are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do all this.</v>

3610
02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:52.310
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to look into this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to get.</v>

3611
02:43:52.330 --> 02:43:57.330
<v Speaker 2>So most people are going to hear what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they heard when they were little </v>

3612
02:43:57.330 --> 02:43:58.840
<v Speaker 2>marijuana is for losers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana makes you lazy.</v>

3613
02:43:59.050 --> 02:44:04.050
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be a lazy stoner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be that marijuana is </v>

3614
02:44:04.050 --> 02:44:04.050
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like jeff sessions,</v>

3615
02:44:04.050 --> 02:44:08.700
<v Speaker 2>the fucking guys on record saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good people do not smoke marijuana.</v>

3616
02:44:09.730 --> 02:44:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about millions of people.</v>

3617
02:44:11.651 --> 02:44:13.210
<v Speaker 2>You're saying none of them are good </v>
<v Speaker 2>people</v>

3618
02:44:13.590 --> 02:44:14.280
<v Speaker 1>generally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

3619
02:44:14.300 --> 02:44:18.280
<v Speaker 1>That is a thing of the people that smoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana are generally nicer.</v>

3620
02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Kind of more thoughtful people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that in some way we're all </v>

3621
02:44:24.671 --> 02:44:25.600
<v Speaker 1>connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all,</v>

3622
02:44:25.810 --> 02:44:30.590
<v Speaker 1>we're not fucking independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how's that better</v>

3623
02:44:30.890 --> 02:44:32.180
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he doesn't smoke pot.</v>

3624
02:44:32.210 --> 02:44:33.270
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3625
02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:35.480
<v Speaker 2>we need to fucking hold him down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make him smoke pot.</v>

3626
02:44:35.660 --> 02:44:37.490
<v Speaker 2>That's what we need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he'll freak out.</v>

3627
02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:43.120
<v Speaker 2>Apparently Joey Diaz gave pauly shore </v>
<v Speaker 2>some stars of death on his podcast and </v>

3628
02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:44.270
<v Speaker 2>now polly won't release the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3629
02:44:44.271 --> 02:44:45.260
<v Speaker 2>hide it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burn it,</v>

3630
02:44:45.500 --> 02:44:47.180
<v Speaker 2>burn it with fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill it,</v>

3631
02:44:47.900 --> 02:44:48.890
<v Speaker 2>kill it like a demon.</v>

3632
02:44:49.730 --> 02:44:54.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis is so good that when you smoke </v>

3633
02:44:54.730 --> 02:44:59.411
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is full of fucking tall and </v>

3634
02:44:59.411 --> 02:45:00.080
<v Speaker 1>costage ins and everything in smoke into</v>
<v Speaker 1>your lungs,</v>

3635
02:45:00.140 --> 02:45:01.580
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even damage your lungs.</v>

3636
02:45:02.090 --> 02:45:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's supposed to be a different </v>

3637
02:45:07.090 --> 02:45:07.090
<v Speaker 2>type of smoke though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the smoke that you get,</v>

3638
02:45:07.090 --> 02:45:09.050
<v Speaker 2>it's probably harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't have the same,</v>

3639
02:45:09.470 --> 02:45:11.510
<v Speaker 2>but the properties of it don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

3640
02:45:11.650 --> 02:45:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the issue apparently with tobacco in </v>

3641
02:45:16.650 --> 02:45:16.650
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just regular tobacco.</v>

3642
02:45:16.650 --> 02:45:21.071
<v Speaker 2>If you're smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a regular rolled cigarette of hand </v>

3643
02:45:21.071 --> 02:45:21.170
<v Speaker 2>rolled tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pure tobacco.</v>

3644
02:45:21.180 --> 02:45:22.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3645
02:45:22.281 --> 02:45:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other bullshit ingredients is not as bad</v>

3646
02:45:25.701 --> 02:45:27.920
<v Speaker 2>for you as a cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still bad.</v>

3647
02:45:27.950 --> 02:45:31.520
<v Speaker 2>I've got a ton of chemicals in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds of chemicals by the way,</v>

3648
02:45:31.521 --> 02:45:33.320
<v Speaker 2>approved by our government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

3649
02:45:33.321 --> 02:45:34.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pour it in there.</v>

3650
02:45:35.340 --> 02:45:36.430
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be good,</v>

3651
02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:41.440
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to get people to throw it in </v>

3652
02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:41.440
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3653
02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Government govern what government's </v>
<v Speaker 1>meant is your mind.</v>

3654
02:45:43.010 --> 02:45:48.010
<v Speaker 2>But marijuana smoke has been shown to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>an expectorant actually can clear the </v>

3655
02:45:48.010 --> 02:45:49.440
<v Speaker 2>lungs of certain issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

3656
02:45:50.320 --> 02:45:54.160
<v Speaker 1>highlights the Broncos as opposed to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>backhoe is closing them all the time.</v>

3657
02:45:54.690 --> 02:45:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're familiar with a </v>

3658
02:45:59.690 --> 02:46:01.531
<v Speaker 1>study that was done here at Ucla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe a guy called Donald Tuscan.</v>

3659
02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:05.440
<v Speaker 1>He did it over 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a properly funded study.</v>

3660
02:46:06.330 --> 02:46:11.330
<v Speaker 1>While I was at properly funded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was funded to look for </v>

3661
02:46:11.330 --> 02:46:14.081
<v Speaker 1>negative results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the purpose of this study was to </v>

3662
02:46:14.081 --> 02:46:16.340
<v Speaker 1>prove that smoking cannabis damages your</v>
<v Speaker 1>lungs just like cigarettes,</v>

3663
02:46:16.341 --> 02:46:21.341
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the followed three groups over 20 </v>

3664
02:46:21.341 --> 02:46:23.831
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarette smokers only or tobacco </v>

3665
02:46:23.831 --> 02:46:27.790
<v Speaker 1>tobacco and marijuana together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana only and to tobacco smokers </v>

3666
02:46:28.221 --> 02:46:29.900
<v Speaker 1>over 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

3667
02:46:30.050 --> 02:46:32.630
<v Speaker 1>loss of lung function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of cancers,</v>

3668
02:46:32.631 --> 02:46:37.631
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff we already know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The middle group was way less and the </v>

3669
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:43.150
<v Speaker 1>marijuana group smoker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like daily smoking over 20 years was no </v>

3670
02:46:44.121 --> 02:46:47.600
<v Speaker 1>increased cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no loss of lung function,</v>

3671
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:53.230
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had a slight increase in lung </v>

3672
02:46:53.230 --> 02:46:54.920
<v Speaker 1>function as compared to nonsmokers</v>

3673
02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:59.110
<v Speaker 2>other exercise and taking big tokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he gets</v>

3674
02:46:59.220 --> 02:47:01.500
<v Speaker 1>because you're taking in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

3675
02:47:01.980 --> 02:47:05.100
<v Speaker 1>because the cannabis is dilating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>broncos all the time.</v>

3676
02:47:05.101 --> 02:47:07.320
<v Speaker 1>If you keep dialing and keep dialing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep dialing,</v>

3677
02:47:07.340 --> 02:47:12.340
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's going to get more </v>

3678
02:47:12.340 --> 02:47:12.340
<v Speaker 1>functional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3679
02:47:12.340 --> 02:47:15.831
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just it's counterintuitive to a </v>

3680
02:47:15.831 --> 02:47:15.831
<v Speaker 1>lot of people that think that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative.</v>

3681
02:47:15.831 --> 02:47:20.140
<v Speaker 1>It's bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just see it as a super health </v>

3682
02:47:20.140 --> 02:47:20.140
<v Speaker 1>supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see anything negative.</v>

3683
02:47:20.140 --> 02:47:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it as a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the plant and yeah,</v>

3684
02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:26.250
<v Speaker 1>you get high and you feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's in your life?</v>

3685
02:47:26.251 --> 02:47:29.820
<v Speaker 1>It's silly shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

3686
02:47:29.821 --> 02:47:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3687
02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:35.640
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that people are starting to </v>

3688
02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:35.640
<v Speaker 2>understand that more now than when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were kids for sure.</v>

3689
02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to smoke when I was a teenager </v>

3690
02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:40.480
<v Speaker 1>and in England we mix it with tobacco or</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3691
02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:42.500
<v Speaker 1>just until I came here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3692
02:47:42.501 --> 02:47:46.460
<v Speaker 1>like people smoke it pure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mix with tobacco now because I'm</v>

3693
02:47:46.461 --> 02:47:48.800
<v Speaker 1>realizing the weed is good and tobacco </v>
<v Speaker 1>is bad.</v>

3694
02:47:48.801 --> 02:47:53.801
<v Speaker 1>Before I didn't know both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably bad for you and I'll give a </v>

3695
02:47:53.801 --> 02:47:53.801
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3696
02:47:53.801 --> 02:47:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did that get started in England?</v>

3697
02:47:54.131 --> 02:47:55.420
<v Speaker 2>Because every time had been over </v>
<v Speaker 2>England.</v>

3698
02:47:55.630 --> 02:47:56.490
<v Speaker 2>They do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

3699
02:47:56.500 --> 02:47:57.940
<v Speaker 2>do you make sure we'd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With tobacco it's was like,</v>

3700
02:47:57.941 --> 02:47:58.840
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3701
02:47:58.841 --> 02:48:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>

3702
02:48:00.460 --> 02:48:02.860
<v Speaker 2>that's how it was always done that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I grew up.</v>

3703
02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Birmingham as a ton of </v>

3704
02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Jamaicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3705
02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:10.330
<v Speaker 1>so the Jamaicans were the guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought the weed and,</v>

3706
02:48:10.331 --> 02:48:15.331
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even they used to mix with tobacco </v>

3707
02:48:15.331 --> 02:48:15.790
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people smoke cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how she got to,</v>

3708
02:48:15.970 --> 02:48:17.130
<v Speaker 1>you got to Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3709
02:48:17.150 --> 02:48:17.890
<v Speaker 1>with something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3710
02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:22.920
<v Speaker 1>So people mentioned it with tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think last time I smoked tobacco </v>

3711
02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:27.370
<v Speaker 1>was probably like eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine years ago when I became educated </v>

3712
02:48:27.370 --> 02:48:27.370
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3713
02:48:27.370 --> 02:48:28.690
<v Speaker 1>this cannabis is really good on its own.</v>

3714
02:48:28.870 --> 02:48:31.480
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take a cigar,</v>

3715
02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:33.850
<v Speaker 2>they take out the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tobacco.</v>

3716
02:48:34.850 --> 02:48:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they make a blunt out of it.</v>

3717
02:48:36.221 --> 02:48:40.770
<v Speaker 2>But you're taking in tobacco and belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he gives you this weird high.</v>

3718
02:48:40.910 --> 02:48:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're getting that nicotine </v>

3719
02:48:45.910 --> 02:48:45.910
<v Speaker 1>buzz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a head buzz,</v>

3720
02:48:45.910 --> 02:48:48.530
<v Speaker 2>but you're also inhaling in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't do with cigars.</v>

3721
02:48:49.130 --> 02:48:51.320
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually you puff it out,</v>

3722
02:48:51.321 --> 02:48:51.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3723
02:48:51.591 --> 02:48:53.100
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the tobacco,</v>

3724
02:48:53.101 --> 02:48:58.101
<v Speaker 2>it gets into your body from your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't really inhale deep into </v>

3725
02:48:58.101 --> 02:48:58.101
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to use it,</v>

3726
02:48:58.101 --> 02:48:58.110
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

3727
02:48:58.150 --> 02:49:02.010
<v Speaker 1>hemp papers and also I vaporize extract </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

3728
02:49:02.130 --> 02:49:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dabbing Nicole here.</v>

3729
02:49:05.250 --> 02:49:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I do that.</v>

3730
02:49:06.510 --> 02:49:07.690
<v Speaker 1>I find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3731
02:49:07.691 --> 02:49:12.691
<v Speaker 1>I find it a bit different between </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking weed and Dab in the extract </v>

3732
02:49:12.691 --> 02:49:14.700
<v Speaker 1>smoking weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it a bit more relaxing.</v>

3733
02:49:15.030 --> 02:49:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Dabbing the extract is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that before I go on a bike ride </v>

3734
02:49:20.030 --> 02:49:20.030
<v Speaker 1>or</v>

3735
02:49:20.030 --> 02:49:20.030
<v Speaker 4>cardio or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

3736
02:49:23.900 --> 02:49:25.010
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't get tired,</v>

3737
02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:26.840
<v Speaker 4>don't get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

3738
02:49:26.841 --> 02:49:28.130
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it amazing?</v>

3739
02:49:28.250 --> 02:49:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

3740
02:49:29.330 --> 02:49:30.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you do in running.</v>

3741
02:49:31.460 --> 02:49:36.460
<v Speaker 1>First of all it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dilating your bronco so you can </v>

3742
02:49:36.460 --> 02:49:39.011
<v Speaker 1>deliver more oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think also it's the mental thing </v>

3743
02:49:39.011 --> 02:49:42.131
<v Speaker 1>they like get in that zone and perceived</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain is less.</v>

3744
02:49:42.770 --> 02:49:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Discomfort is less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just keep,</v>

3745
02:49:45.230 --> 02:49:46.590
<v Speaker 1>just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

3770
02:50:40.861 --> 02:50:41.380
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember the Arnold?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you do.</v>

3771
02:50:41.381 --> 02:50:46.000
<v Speaker 4>Arnold is numero uno token on a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>one though.</v>

3772
02:50:46.150 --> 02:50:48.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People were like,</v>

3773
02:50:48.520 --> 02:50:52.630
<v Speaker 4>what is he doing back then it was almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he was getting drunk or something.</v>

3774
02:50:54.240 --> 02:50:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People didn't even think about it and he</v>

3775
02:50:57.681 --> 02:50:58.880
<v Speaker 1>was the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>

3776
02:50:58.910 --> 02:51:01.340
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't passing it around other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3777
02:51:01.341 --> 02:51:03.530
<v Speaker 1>He was the only one on camera smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3778
02:51:03.590 --> 02:51:08.590
<v Speaker 1>they look guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll probably schedule on the smoke on </v>

3779
02:51:08.590 --> 02:51:08.590
<v Speaker 1>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3780
02:51:08.590 --> 02:51:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3781
02:51:08.970 --> 02:51:10.700
<v Speaker 1>it's still viewed negatively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3782
02:51:10.701 --> 02:51:11.470
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3783
02:51:11.810 --> 02:51:16.810
<v Speaker 1>an athlete say he smokes marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's risking maybe losing is a </v>

3784
02:51:16.810 --> 02:51:19.660
<v Speaker 1>sponsorship and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3785
02:51:19.710 --> 02:51:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have sponsors.</v>

3786
02:51:21.200 --> 02:51:22.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm independent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

3787
02:51:22.750 --> 02:51:24.710
<v Speaker 1>a bit more free to speak out.</v>

3788
02:51:25.180 --> 02:51:27.130
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the crazy thing to me was the nfl,</v>

3789
02:51:27.670 --> 02:51:32.670
<v Speaker 4>the nfl saying that these guys can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoke pot and they suspend them for </v>

3790
02:51:32.670 --> 02:51:36.280
<v Speaker 4>smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile it's okay to run full speed at</v>

3791
02:51:36.281 --> 02:51:41.281
<v Speaker 4>each other and smash into each other and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the massive amount of damage that's </v>

3792
02:51:41.281 --> 02:51:42.010
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3793
02:51:42.370 --> 02:51:44.260
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not a problem,</v>

3794
02:51:44.680 --> 02:51:49.680
<v Speaker 4>but the problem that would actually help</v>
<v Speaker 4>with brain injuries because a lot of </v>

3795
02:51:49.680 --> 02:51:49.680
<v Speaker 4>studies,</v>

3796
02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:52.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Alzheimer's and stuff like that,</v>

3797
02:51:52.130 --> 02:51:56.190
<v Speaker 1>that's very protective on the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it could have helped them.</v>

3798
02:51:56.200 --> 02:51:57.810
<v Speaker 1>If anything I would definitely wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>

3799
02:51:57.811 --> 02:51:57.830
<v Speaker 1>No</v>

3800
02:51:57.890 --> 02:52:00.020
<v Speaker 4>harm them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even if it's just cbd oil,</v>

3801
02:52:00.021 --> 02:52:03.890
<v Speaker 4>it's a neuroprotectant canabinoids yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3802
02:52:03.891 --> 02:52:04.730
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3803
02:52:04.731 --> 02:52:09.731
<v Speaker 4>we living in an age where information is</v>
<v Speaker 4>leaking out there and people understand </v>

3804
02:52:09.731 --> 02:52:14.461
<v Speaker 4>things more today than they ever did </v>
<v Speaker 4>before where there's still a massive </v>

3805
02:52:14.461 --> 02:52:14.461
<v Speaker 4>amount of ignorance that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>combat,</v>

3806
02:52:14.461 --> 02:52:14.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3807
02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:17.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a head of 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3808
02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:18.070
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3809
02:52:18.071 --> 02:52:19.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in Europe,</v>

3810
02:52:19.860 --> 02:52:24.730
<v Speaker 1>although I live in Spain now and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain it's not legal,</v>

3811
02:52:25.390 --> 02:52:26.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3812
02:52:26.860 --> 02:52:31.860
<v Speaker 1>it's legal to grow in your house for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own use is legal to smoke in your </v>

3813
02:52:32.171 --> 02:52:34.330
<v Speaker 1>house for your own use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's happened is,</v>

3814
02:52:34.420 --> 02:52:37.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these collectors are being created,</v>

3815
02:52:38.380 --> 02:52:39.580
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3816
02:52:39.581 --> 02:52:43.240
<v Speaker 1>so I can smoke in my own private </v>
<v Speaker 1>residence and I can grow whatever,</v>

3817
02:52:43.330 --> 02:52:45.450
<v Speaker 1>let's say three plants for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get bullied.</v>

3818
02:52:45.970 --> 02:52:48.820
<v Speaker 1>So what if there's 100 of us now in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>collective,</v>

3819
02:52:48.821 --> 02:52:51.580
<v Speaker 1>in this club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we can grow 300 plants.</v>

3820
02:52:51.581 --> 02:52:56.581
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be nonprofit </v>

3821
02:52:56.581 --> 02:52:56.581
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3822
02:52:56.581 --> 02:52:59.440
<v Speaker 1>so when you go and you buy your weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not technically buying a weed,</v>

3823
02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:02.980
<v Speaker 1>you're contributing to the upkeep of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>collective.</v>

3824
02:53:03.220 --> 02:53:03.940
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

3825
02:53:03.970 --> 02:53:05.300
<v Speaker 1>So that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3826
02:53:05.320 --> 02:53:09.100
<v Speaker 1>and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Holland it's um,</v>

3827
02:53:10.180 --> 02:53:14.590
<v Speaker 1>tolerated they call it technically is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not legal is tolerated,</v>

3828
02:53:14.591 --> 02:53:17.330
<v Speaker 1>so the console in the coffee shops there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whatever,</v>

3829
02:53:17.360 --> 02:53:22.360
<v Speaker 1>and Amsterdam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those two countries a little bit </v>

3830
02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:25.651
<v Speaker 1>ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everywhere else is still still not </v>

3831
02:53:25.651 --> 02:53:25.651
<v Speaker 1>legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in UK where I come from,</v>

3832
02:53:25.651 --> 02:53:30.330
<v Speaker 1>it's not legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the police have already stated then </v>

3833
02:53:30.330 --> 02:53:34.700
<v Speaker 1>going to arrest people for smoking weed </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're considered a waste of </v>

3834
02:53:34.700 --> 02:53:35.380
<v Speaker 1>their time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3835
02:53:35.470 --> 02:53:38.470
<v Speaker 1>so any major city in England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go walk down the street,</v>

3836
02:53:38.471 --> 02:53:43.471
<v Speaker 1>you can smell weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just walk down the street and </v>

3837
02:53:43.471 --> 02:53:43.471
<v Speaker 1>smoking weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the police are there,</v>

3838
02:53:43.471 --> 02:53:43.471
<v Speaker 1>they might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3839
02:53:43.540 --> 02:53:44.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

3840
02:53:44.170 --> 02:53:46.960
<v Speaker 1>put that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's as far as it goes.</v>

3841
02:53:46.961 --> 02:53:49.300
<v Speaker 1>So technically it's still illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of like,</v>

3842
02:53:50.020 --> 02:53:51.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the police are not,</v>

3843
02:53:51.760 --> 02:53:53.410
<v Speaker 1>they don't care about it unless you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling it.</v>

3844
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:58.750
<v Speaker 4>I think Canada is set to essentially </v>
<v Speaker 4>legalize it nationwide and think that's </v>

3845
02:53:58.940 --> 02:54:03.940
<v Speaker 4>the most recent revelation from Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're essentially ready to just kind </v>

3846
02:54:04.271 --> 02:54:06.200
<v Speaker 4>of has always been a pretty good weed </v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

3847
02:54:06.201 --> 02:54:06.860
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3848
02:54:06.890 --> 02:54:08.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Vancouver in particular,</v>

3849
02:54:08.600 --> 02:54:13.600
<v Speaker 4>there's a great documentary about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana industry and it's impact on </v>

3850
02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:17.231
<v Speaker 4>Vancouver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called the union fantastic </v>

3851
02:54:17.231 --> 02:54:19.901
<v Speaker 4>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just showing how ridiculous it is and </v>

3852
02:54:19.901 --> 02:54:22.721
<v Speaker 4>how inexorably tied marijuana is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>their entire economy in Vancouver.</v>

3853
02:54:22.850 --> 02:54:23.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3854
02:54:23.780 --> 02:54:28.780
<v Speaker 4>the money that comes in from marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 4>is just a gigantic portion of their </v>

3855
02:54:28.780 --> 02:54:29.340
<v Speaker 4>economy and it's all this.</v>

3856
02:54:29.730 --> 02:54:34.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's why Colorado setting such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of making so much money,</v>

3857
02:54:34.701 --> 02:54:39.701
<v Speaker 1>like we got to be other states looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it like a think fucking Detroit </v>

3858
02:54:39.701 --> 02:54:40.670
<v Speaker 1>should get on that.</v>

3859
02:54:40.700 --> 02:54:42.170
<v Speaker 4>Trying to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3860
02:54:42.290 --> 02:54:43.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Detroit's a mess.</v>

3861
02:54:43.581 --> 02:54:45.260
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And coming back with like,</v>

3862
02:54:45.261 --> 02:54:46.940
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>handmade stuff,</v>

3863
02:54:46.941 --> 02:54:51.941
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of things like different</v>
<v Speaker 4>industries and different small </v>

3864
02:54:52.221 --> 02:54:55.280
<v Speaker 4>businesses are starting to emerge in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Detroit that are kind of very,</v>

3865
02:54:55.340 --> 02:54:57.260
<v Speaker 4>very promising.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

3866
02:54:57.261 --> 02:54:58.550
<v Speaker 4>that would be a huge factor.</v>

3867
02:54:58.980 --> 02:55:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a huge industry out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3868
02:55:01.150 --> 02:55:03.070
<v Speaker 1>not just grow in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other.</v>

3869
02:55:03.230 --> 02:55:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I come here and it's like I'm a kid in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>candy shop.</v>

3870

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got chocolate and it's like tells </v>

<v Speaker 1>you're careful with those cakes though.</v>

3875
02:55:21.380 --> 02:55:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3876
02:55:22.011 --> 02:55:23.690
<v Speaker 1>edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always tell people,</v>

3877
02:55:23.691 --> 02:55:28.691
<v Speaker 1>be careful with edibles because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're smoking a joint and you take a </v>

3878
02:55:28.691 --> 02:55:32.471
<v Speaker 1>couple of puffs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to hit you pretty much </v>

3879
02:55:32.471 --> 02:55:33.380
<v Speaker 1>immediately to your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to feel it and you're to</v>

3880
02:55:33.390 --> 02:55:38.390
<v Speaker 1>decide whether you want to smoke some </v>
<v Speaker 1>more on that or maybe you want to just </v>

3881
02:55:38.390 --> 02:55:40.400
<v Speaker 1>put it down right and chill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you eat it,</v>

3882
02:55:40.980 --> 02:55:42.860
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take 45 minutes to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>

3883
02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:44.630
<v Speaker 1>so hit your system and you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3884
02:55:45.620 --> 02:55:48.740
<v Speaker 1>how strong that's going to be and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too strong,</v>

3885
02:55:48.741 --> 02:55:49.970
<v Speaker 1>which most of the time it is.</v>

3886
02:55:49.970 --> 02:55:54.970
<v Speaker 1>If you're not experienced then you're on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking ride and you can't get off </v>

3887
02:55:56.360 --> 02:55:59.990
<v Speaker 1>hours and it can be pretty unpleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean like too much thc.</v>

3888
02:55:59.991 --> 02:56:04.991
<v Speaker 1>For somebody that's not used to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can feel very paranoid and very </v>

3889
02:56:04.991 --> 02:56:06.110
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can feel nausea,</v>

3890
02:56:06.111 --> 02:56:09.800
<v Speaker 1>she might vomit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get low blood sugar a.</v>

3891
02:56:09.801 --> 02:56:14.801
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff is not going to be a nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and probably then you're </v>

3892
02:56:14.801 --> 02:56:14.840
<v Speaker 1>going to have a negative view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis.</v>

3893
02:56:14.841 --> 02:56:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that shit.</v>

3894
02:56:15.741 --> 02:56:19.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going anywhere near that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3895
02:56:19.250 --> 02:56:24.250
<v Speaker 1>so unless you're experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just say stay away from edibles </v>

3896
02:56:24.250 --> 02:56:25.820
<v Speaker 1>or like just have a small piece and wait</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fucking hour.</v>

3897
02:56:25.821 --> 02:56:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be tempted to like,</v>

3898
02:56:27.650 --> 02:56:28.670
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel anything.</v>

3899
02:56:28.671 --> 02:56:31.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll take another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be fucked.</v>

3900
02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:34.580
<v Speaker 1>That's great advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go stepped gingerly.</v>

3901
02:56:34.640 --> 02:56:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go very slowly.</v>

3902
02:56:36.051 --> 02:56:38.810
<v Speaker 1>And the edibles because it takes time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>digest it.</v>

3903
02:56:38.810 --> 02:56:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Time to get into the bloodstream and </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to feel it.</v>

3904
02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:45.500
<v Speaker 1>So most people will eat some and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel anything.</v>

3905
02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:47.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't have another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

3906
02:56:48.110 --> 02:56:48.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3907
02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it happen so many times that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too late.</v>

3908
02:56:52.360 --> 02:56:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not going to be over in five </v>

3909
02:56:57.360 --> 02:56:57.360
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have hours of that.</v>

3910
02:56:57.360 --> 02:56:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3911
02:56:57.360 --> 02:57:00.500
<v Speaker 1>and then they just to say that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of stuff is bad as you know.</v>

3912
02:57:00.510 --> 02:57:01.910
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>

3913
02:57:01.940 --> 02:57:04.610
<v Speaker 1>That's the beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even after a horrendous,</v>

3914
02:57:04.640 --> 02:57:09.640
<v Speaker 1>terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing bad can happen to you </v>

3915
02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:12.400
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might vomit as like the worst thing </v>

3916
02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:13.160
<v Speaker 1>that could happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to be careful because I read</v>

3917
02:57:13.161 --> 02:57:14.090
<v Speaker 1>the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3918
02:57:14.780 --> 02:57:19.780
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a level at which cannabis can </v>

3919
02:57:19.780 --> 02:57:23.531
<v Speaker 1>kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to be careful that you </v>

3920
02:57:23.531 --> 02:57:26.711
<v Speaker 1>don't smoke 628 kilos cannabis in 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes because if you do that,</v>

3921
02:57:28.521 --> 02:57:29.450
<v Speaker 1>that could be toxic.</v>

3922
02:57:29.450 --> 02:57:34.450
<v Speaker 1>That could be lethal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone out there is going to try to </v>

3923
02:57:34.450 --> 02:57:34.450
<v Speaker 1>prove you wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3924
02:57:34.450 --> 02:57:35.150
<v Speaker 1>One point five fucking tons in 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

3925
02:57:35.151 --> 02:57:36.920
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to hail that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like good luck to you.</v>

3926
02:57:37.010 --> 02:57:42.010
<v Speaker 1>I think that's actually the ld 52,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means liesel lethal dose for 50 </v>

3927
02:57:42.010 --> 02:57:44.570
<v Speaker 1>percent of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty percent of the population are most</v>

3928
02:57:44.571 --> 02:57:49.571
<v Speaker 1>definitely pussies survive that anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I couldn't smoke a fucking,</v>

3929
02:57:50.700 --> 02:57:53.720
<v Speaker 1>I dunno in 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much could you smoke?</v>

3930
02:57:53.721 --> 02:57:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Like five grams or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3931
02:57:56.420 --> 02:57:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the.</v>

3932
02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:02.400
<v Speaker 1>You could do more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a vaporizer you can get pretty </v>

3933
02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:02.400
<v Speaker 1>deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

3934
02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:03.870
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get anywhere near </v>
<v Speaker 1>620.</v>

3935
02:58:03.880 --> 02:58:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why that came at 628.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six hundred and 27 or 600.</v>

3936
02:58:09.331 --> 02:58:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Twenty nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>

3937
02:58:10.410 --> 02:58:13.020
<v Speaker 1>it's theoretical anyway because no one's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever died from it.</v>

3938
02:58:13.060 --> 02:58:14.010
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever died from it.</v>

3939
02:58:14.010 --> 02:58:19.010
<v Speaker 1>So like what other substance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenya not die from it.</v>

3940
02:58:19.560 --> 02:58:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Even water is you have too much water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You drown.</v>

3941
02:58:22.200 --> 02:58:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean this is pretty harmless </v>

3942
02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:27.200
<v Speaker 1>fucking substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's no,</v>

3943
02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:29.320
<v Speaker 1>there's no feasible toxic level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

3944
02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:30.630
<v Speaker 1>600,</v>
<v Speaker 1>28 kilos.</v>

3945
02:58:30.631 --> 02:58:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking the piss like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3946
02:58:33.330 --> 02:58:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't smoke that in my lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often do you smoke pot?</v>

3947

<v Speaker 1>week or two just because I want to have </v>

3953
02:58:53.881 --> 02:58:56.070
<v Speaker 1>the discipline to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3979
02:59:57.440 --> 02:59:57.930
<v Speaker 1>we got a thing called swiftly the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3980
02:59:58.260 --> 03:00:00.160
<v Speaker 1>the date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actual date.</v>

3981
03:00:00.161 --> 03:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Saturday is 29.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninth.</v>

3982
03:00:01.930 --> 03:00:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3983
03:00:02.180 --> 03:00:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a competition called Super </v>

3984
03:00:07.180 --> 03:00:11.090
<v Speaker 1>League and this is for bodybuilders </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash strength athletes and it's </v>

3985
03:00:11.611 --> 03:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>somewhat functional because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3986
03:00:15.750 --> 03:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>you get a bodybuilder on stage and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general public look at that and say what</v>

3987
03:00:19.651 --> 03:00:24.651
<v Speaker 1>the fuck is this like strange and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>a product of just taking drugs and they </v>

3988
03:00:24.651 --> 03:00:28.701
<v Speaker 1>don't appreciate the work that goes into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and how strong and athletic some of</v>

3989
03:00:28.891 --> 03:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>these guys can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this competition is,</v>

3990
03:00:32.190 --> 03:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>has two rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first round is lifting,</v>

3991
03:00:35.010 --> 03:00:40.010
<v Speaker 1>so you get judged on eight different </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercises you score a maximum of 12 reps</v>

3992
03:00:40.171 --> 03:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So um,</v>

3993
03:00:42.091 --> 03:00:44.550
<v Speaker 1>there's that and then there's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physique round,</v>

3994
03:00:44.910 --> 03:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's done by computer,</v>

3995
03:00:46.620 --> 03:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>so it scans various areas of your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>and gives you a score on that.</v>

3996
03:00:52.140 --> 03:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Sounds a bit complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to go on superleague </v>

3997
03:00:57.140 --> 03:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got explain everything.</v>

3998
03:00:57.140 --> 03:00:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Have you been doing this for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be the first one.</v>

3999
03:00:59.360 --> 03:00:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

4000
03:01:00.030 --> 03:01:05.030
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we weren't sure like what reaction we </v>

4001
03:01:05.030 --> 03:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>get with the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's been off the fucking hook and I</v>

4002
03:01:07.501 --> 03:01:12.501
<v Speaker 1>think we're going to get a new breed of </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes that are maybe not purely </v>

4003
03:01:12.501 --> 03:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>physique bodybuilders as like the Mr </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympia.</v>

4004
03:01:14.760 --> 03:01:16.480
<v Speaker 1>We've got guys coming from power </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting,</v>

4005
03:01:16.510 --> 03:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>we've got guys coming from bodybuilding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of guys out there in the </v>

4006
03:01:21.510 --> 03:01:22.170
<v Speaker 1>gyms around the world that are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletic,</v>

4007
03:01:22.171 --> 03:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freaky guys and girls.</v>

4008
03:01:24.690 --> 03:01:29.690
<v Speaker 1>We've got both categories that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to compete in a bodybuilding </v>

4009
03:01:29.690 --> 03:01:33.381
<v Speaker 1>competition for various reasons or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do want to compete in a bodybuilding </v>

4010
03:01:33.381 --> 03:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>competition and they want something </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative to do.</v>

4011
03:01:35.071 --> 03:01:40.071
<v Speaker 1>We've got a competition between a team </v>
<v Speaker 1>la and team Atlanta as well.</v>

4012
03:01:40.440 --> 03:01:43.410
<v Speaker 1>And we've got interest for the roll this</v>
<v Speaker 1>out internationally.</v>

4013
03:01:43.411 --> 03:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

4014
03:01:44.430 --> 03:01:46.770
<v Speaker 3>keep your eye on that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People go to it.</v>
