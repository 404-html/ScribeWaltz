00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:02.760
<v Speaker 1>I said it.</v>

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.990
<v Speaker 1>I did say I can't help myself.</v>

5
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:05.310
<v Speaker 1>You must be a Michigan guy.</v>

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.960
<v Speaker 1>He has a very prodigious vocabulary.</v>

7
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>It's preposterous.</v>

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I've been blasting it out.</v>

12
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Every time it comes into my stupid head,</v>

13
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>it gets it the in a groove where you can stop saying you got their words.</v>

14
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:18.781
<v Speaker 1>That definitely,</v>

15
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:19.640
<v Speaker 1>cause you remember when you saw,</v>

16
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.490
<v Speaker 1>every used to say was the first one I ever heard said whatever bananas.</v>

17
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>He's just a little whatever.</v>

18
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>You were the first one that made that inflection and it's spread all over the</v>

19
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:30.894
<v Speaker 1>valley.</v>

20
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>What ever you did,</v>

21
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.551
<v Speaker 1>you were the first one?</v>

22
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:35.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

23
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:36.594
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

24
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.860
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] first one I ever heard say it and then everybody started saying it</v>

25
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>and then he didn't say it as much.</v>

26
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.491
<v Speaker 1>What did I say?</v>

27
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what you're saying.</v>

28
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>You know you'd be talking about like something that would piss you off and you</v>

29
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>know what ever,</v>

30
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>you know instead like the,</v>

31
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>instead of saying whatever you made that beat what ever and then I didn't know I</v>

32
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:00.804
<v Speaker 1>did that.</v>

33
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.160

50
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 1>the pause that makes it so unique and mind.</v>

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.230
<v Speaker 1>That's where all the brilliance lies.</v>

67
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.470

74
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.900

159
00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:28.320
<v Speaker 2>The kid just when you think he can't just,</v>

160
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.470
<v Speaker 2>he can't add a different flair.</v>

161
00:04:30.471 --> 00:04:31.890
<v Speaker 2>This is no more flares to add.</v>

162
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Does</v>

163
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.480
<v Speaker 1>this Retardo Martha bomb over here?</v>

164
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I got so much good feedback calling you or retard the cool thing to do.</v>

165
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

166
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.740
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing that's weird about opening for bands.</v>

167
00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:45.530
<v Speaker 1>They will tune up while you're on onstage.</v>

168
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

169
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.700
<v Speaker 1>in that level yet.</v>

170
00:04:46.701 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I work with share,</v>

171
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:52.440
<v Speaker 1>it was classy because she was the one that there was the by far the best job I</v>

172
00:04:52.441 --> 00:04:56.130
<v Speaker 1>ever had an opening for anybody because she knows she had a great crowd.</v>

173
00:04:56.131 --> 00:04:59.030
<v Speaker 1>She had transvestites and mothers with the grandmothers,</v>

174
00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.910
<v Speaker 1>with their grandchildren.</v>

175
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>That was the audience.</v>

176
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

177
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.770
<v Speaker 1>ECLECTIC.</v>

178
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.930
<v Speaker 1>If you know what the security told me,</v>

179
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.110
<v Speaker 1>if they ever saw a single straight guy alone this thing and he looked straight,</v>

180
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.750
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>

181
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.420
<v Speaker 1>they would track him all night because no,</v>

182
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:14.610
<v Speaker 1>no guy along goes through a Cher concert.</v>

183
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:15.444
<v Speaker 1>If you're straight,</v>

184
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.610
<v Speaker 1>well that's a gay guy dancing and happy.</v>

185
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.473
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

186
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.660
<v Speaker 1>So if someone's going to be like a crazy stalker,</v>

187
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.430
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a straight straight guy.</v>

188
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.990
<v Speaker 1>But she was fun though.</v>

189
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:26.610
<v Speaker 1>You enjoyed working with her,</v>

191
00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:26.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

192
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

193
00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:27.930
<v Speaker 1>I really liked her.</v>

194
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever feel like a friendship with her?</v>

195
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:29.791
<v Speaker 1>Do you contact her?</v>

196
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:30.624
<v Speaker 1>I'm not anymore.</v>

197
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.321
<v Speaker 1>But you know she's,</v>

198
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:32.760
<v Speaker 1>she's very isolated.</v>

199
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

200
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.380
<v Speaker 1>she's a good person.</v>

201
00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:35.214
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

202
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.273
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

203
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.010
<v Speaker 1>she used to ask me about the world.</v>

204
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:38.131
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

205
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:40.890
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't really in it cause she wasn't really in it to go,</v>

206
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:42.140
<v Speaker 1>well what's it like and you,</v>

207

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:45.720
<v Speaker 1>she asked me about people and one night we went to,</v>

209
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

210
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I talked to her in the going out in Montreal.</v>

211
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:48.151
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

212
00:05:48.151 --> 00:05:48.331

215
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.411

221
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.290

<v Speaker 1>What's her name?</v>

228
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's all she had to hear it.</v>

229
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.641
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

230
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:22.850

<v Speaker 1>what's your name?</v>

233
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>So then now that validated that she can't go out,</v>

234
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

235
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>But I have one guy,</v>

236
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:29.551
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

237
00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

238
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

239
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 1>But we had a good time.</v>

240
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

241
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 1>we say it was a funny thing in the casino.</v>

242
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 1>We would meet when I like in the,</v>

243
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 1>in the arenas,</v>

244
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.360
<v Speaker 1>I would do my act,</v>

245
00:06:39.361 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 1>then they'd have a break and then she'd come up.</v>

246
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>So we'd never see each other except when she had it,</v>

247
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 1>like a team prayer.</v>

248
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes I was in that.</v>

249
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.460
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

250
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.753
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

251
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 1>when she's,</v>

252
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 1>we would cross each other one night her grandmother and grandfather were there</v>

253
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.011
<v Speaker 1>and she said to me,</v>

254
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

255
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.520
<v Speaker 1>you just did a Jewish joke when my grandparents there.</v>

256
00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

257
00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.871
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

258
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 1>your answers out and your grandfather's looking at it.</v>

259
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 1>And she stopped the left.</v>

260
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

261
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.320

262
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.631
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

263
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it was fuck could turn back time.</v>

264
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:14.891

<v Speaker 1>Well you doing any music back when you were opening for these people?</v>

296
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:57.951
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

297
00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:59.210
<v Speaker 1>but I did one time,</v>

298
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.640
<v Speaker 1>it come out at Madison Square Garden.</v>

299
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:03.300
<v Speaker 1>We weren't at the big room that we were doing the,</v>

300
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 1>the smallest of any 500 to the pellet form where they used to box and she,</v>

301
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:09.690
<v Speaker 1>this is so funny about her home.</v>

302
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I the good,</v>

303
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.450
<v Speaker 1>the band wants me to go out and pick playing a guitar and she was singing a</v>

304
00:08:15.451 --> 00:08:16.010
<v Speaker 1>song,</v>

305
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.160
<v Speaker 1>something about the something fire wheels of fire,</v>

306
00:08:20.161 --> 00:08:20.994
<v Speaker 1>some song.</v>

307
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:21.720
<v Speaker 1>And I get,</v>

308
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.210
<v Speaker 1>I get out there and I'm playing,</v>

309
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really playing that.</v>

310
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:25.700
<v Speaker 1>He's the guys behind the Scrim,</v>

311
00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:28.940
<v Speaker 1>the real guitar players playing his ass off and I'm thinking like I'm planning,</v>

312
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:29.340
<v Speaker 1>she's at that,</v>

313
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm singing with her on the song.</v>

314
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 1>We get down on her knees and we're like looking at each other and singing and</v>

315
00:08:35.421 --> 00:08:36.254
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>

316
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.140
<v Speaker 1>And then I get off and she never said a word about it.</v>

317
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 1>She never said,</v>

318
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.180
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

319
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>

320
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:43.790
<v Speaker 1>That was going to be,</v>

321
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 1>and I worked with her for all those years.</v>

322
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:45.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

323
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:47.370
<v Speaker 1>you'd think she would notice this one stage.</v>

324
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:48.841
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

325
00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Song.</v>

326
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.083
<v Speaker 1>But he's singing,</v>

327
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>I forget,</v>

328
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.470
<v Speaker 1>but it was pretty lucky.</v>

329
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.600
<v Speaker 1>It was a good rock song,</v>

330
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.320
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

331
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.870
<v Speaker 1>And it would be something gimme shelter is up.</v>

332
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.193
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's three nights.</v>

340
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:08.530

341
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 1>like Memorial Day or July 4th,</v>

<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

343
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.250
<v Speaker 1>And then I,</v>

344
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.071

<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

352

00:11:14.491 --> 00:11:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I always wanted to see what like a professional punch felt like,</v>

443
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.873
<v Speaker 1>oh God.</v>

444
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Like the fuck I look like to give them an amateur punch.</v>

445
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Well now he that dummy,</v>

446
00:11:21.821 --> 00:11:24.660
<v Speaker 1>the guy's got to his fucking hands and then put gloves on.</v>

447
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Then punch.</v>

448
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:28.710
<v Speaker 1>You either break his hands course with the force that they hit.</v>

449
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:29.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

450
00:11:29.791 --> 00:11:30.870
<v Speaker 1>you could easily break your hand.</v>

451
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.713
<v Speaker 1>Someone's forehead.</v>

452
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.560
<v Speaker 1>He's lucky he didn't say it at the Vinny Corto if any would have probably</v>

453
00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:35.394
<v Speaker 1>punched him.</v>

454
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.293
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

455
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I did a great thing of anyone time ever tell you this.</v>

456
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.453
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

457
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.133
<v Speaker 1>I brought him up.</v>

458
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.183
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

459
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.920
<v Speaker 1>We had a crazy fucking nut cocaine head that lived upstairs and they were funny</v>

460
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.421
<v Speaker 1>today when this,</v>

461
00:11:49.421 --> 00:11:49.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

462
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.550
<v Speaker 1>they would fuck.</v>

463
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 1>And then you hear the shower and it was like five in the morning and I stay up</v>

464
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:54.971
<v Speaker 1>late.</v>

465
00:11:54.971 --> 00:11:55.661
<v Speaker 1>But after a while,</v>

466
00:11:55.661 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

467
00:11:56.771 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>the Musky turned the music down just a little.</v>

468
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.190
<v Speaker 1>That's all nice.</v>

469
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:01.024
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

470
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Speaker 1>next day Kim's window was broken in a car.</v>

471
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 1>I knew he fucking did it.</v>

472
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.610
<v Speaker 1>So I go get Vinny.</v>

473
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Vinny looked like a fucking,</v>

474
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

475

<v Speaker 1>incredibly fucking gorilla.</v>

476
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Just killed 100% and I get,</v>

477
00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:15.664
<v Speaker 1>I get a kick out of him.</v>

478
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.840
<v Speaker 1>And I liked the guy personally,</v>

479
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:17.421
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

480

531
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:15.670
<v Speaker 1>pounds at the gym.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How's your cousin?</v>

535
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I ended,</v>

536
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 1>the thing I realized about myself was that I love violence,</v>

537
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be real.</v>

538
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't like violent movies than it,</v>

539
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:29.230
<v Speaker 1>than it did it and like to see Joey Peshy a 60 year old guy beaten up some 20</v>

540
00:13:29.231 --> 00:13:30.064
<v Speaker 1>year old kid.</v>

541
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 1>No fucking bullshit.</v>

542
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:36.130
<v Speaker 1>When I was there that night when you invited me to the pond and I see these guys</v>

543
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:37.540
<v Speaker 1>really getting fucking whacked and,</v>

544
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.161

<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

546
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.370
<v Speaker 1>we know when it really hits.</v>

547
00:13:39.371 --> 00:13:40.570
<v Speaker 1>The reality is when you sit in,</v>

548
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:40.991
<v Speaker 1>like I told you,</v>

549
00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting behind the guy's mother and girlfriend when he got knocked down</v>

550
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.513
<v Speaker 1>and the mother's like,</v>

553
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:47.854

00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:49.174
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

556
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.190
<v Speaker 1>I loved the pounding they take.</v>

557
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:52.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

558
00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:52.660
<v Speaker 1>it's odd.</v>

559
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.680
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the kid that Tasmanian Devil is just ran up the thing and did</v>

560
00:13:56.681 --> 00:13:57.580
<v Speaker 1>like flips over.</v>

561
00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember him talking about it was kind of maybe he was like maybe Mulatto</v>

562
00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:03.280
<v Speaker 1>or maybe from an island or something.</v>

563
00:14:03.281 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of a light skin black kid and he was phenomenal.</v>

564
00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.680
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

565
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.790
<v Speaker 1>he was leaping in the air like eight feet.</v>

566
00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:12.260
<v Speaker 1>And I'm talking about y'all.</v>

567
00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:12.941
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

568
00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I don't have his name on the top line.</v>

569
00:14:14.561 --> 00:14:14.861
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

570
00:14:14.861 --> 00:14:14.981
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

571
00:14:14.981 --> 00:14:15.590
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>

572
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:19.540
<v Speaker 1>it was like they spread the camera up when you were watching him,</v>

573
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.390
<v Speaker 1>you know he was the one that knocked the guy out.</v>

574
00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

575
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.033
<v Speaker 1>I have to,</v>

576
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I have to find out what his name is right now because he's fucking brilliant and</v>

577
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:31.450
<v Speaker 1>he's an up and coming kid.</v>

578
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:32.711
<v Speaker 1>So just give me a,</v>

579

<v Speaker 1>so while we're waiting,</v>

580
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.290
<v Speaker 1>let's talk more about supplements.</v>

581
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Hey Tom,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The thing about it is,</v>

587
00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:47.890

671
00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

672

<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

673
00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:33.950
<v Speaker 1>not a nice joke,</v>

674
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:34.671
<v Speaker 1>but hopefully,</v>

675
00:16:34.671 --> 00:16:34.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

676
00:16:34.851 --> 00:16:38.630
<v Speaker 1>he took it in the spirit that he was a big success and I was a new comic and</v>

677
00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:39.381
<v Speaker 1>that's the way you took it,</v>

678
00:16:39.381 --> 00:16:40.214
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

679
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:40.970
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

680
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I watched Johnny Carson every single day.</v>

681
00:16:43.311 --> 00:16:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I never missed it and I was a kid and that was because there was no VCRs when I</v>

682
00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:48.050
<v Speaker 1>was a kid.</v>

683
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.310
<v Speaker 1>But I would sit there and watch it every day.</v>

684
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.700
<v Speaker 1>I think I remembered you from that.</v>

685
00:16:52.701 --> 00:16:54.980
<v Speaker 1>When I first moved to La,</v>

686
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.020
<v Speaker 1>I met you at the comedy store and I was like,</v>

687
00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:00.920
<v Speaker 1>from Johnny Carson saw young Carson,</v>

688
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I saw a bunch of guys on Carson that wouldn't have been great comedians.</v>

689
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.530
<v Speaker 1>I saw Jenny on Carson for the first time.</v>

690
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.393
<v Speaker 1>It was a great community.</v>

691
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.740
<v Speaker 1>He was a great comedian as needed.</v>

692
00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

693
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

694
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:10.671
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

695
00:17:10.671 --> 00:17:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Carson was the thing back when you were coming up,</v>

696
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.450
<v Speaker 1>if you got on Carson,</v>

697
00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

698
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:15.883
<v Speaker 1>you fucking made it.</v>

699
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.570
<v Speaker 1>I know he would see a guy like Richard Jenny,</v>

700
00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:19.700
<v Speaker 1>you had like 18 Carson's or something like that.</v>

701
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

702
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:20.893
<v Speaker 1>And you really got writer.</v>

703
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

704
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.200
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

705
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.870
<v Speaker 1>and just such a great comic and you would,</v>

706
00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:25.070
<v Speaker 1>you'd see those uh,</v>

707
00:17:25.071 --> 00:17:26.720
<v Speaker 1>those credits and you go Jesus Christ,</v>

708
00:17:26.721 --> 00:17:28.280
<v Speaker 1>like I did Carson 18 times,</v>

709
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.420
<v Speaker 1>then you would go see him.</v>

710
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:34.280
<v Speaker 1>And of course like he was at the time when I first saw Jenny was like in the</v>

711
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:34.281
<v Speaker 1>80s,</v>

712
00:17:34.281 --> 00:17:35.360
<v Speaker 1>he was a master,</v>

713
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.800
<v Speaker 1>a master.</v>

714
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.280
<v Speaker 1>I remember just being in awe and there was a bunch of other comedians that were</v>

715
00:17:40.281 --> 00:17:41.030
<v Speaker 1>at the uh,</v>

716
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.200
<v Speaker 1>east side comedy club member,</v>

717
00:17:42.201 --> 00:17:43.790
<v Speaker 1>east side in Long Island.</v>

718
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Richard Medivation.</v>

719
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

720
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.083
<v Speaker 1>Richard Meyer Vini,</v>

721
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.480
<v Speaker 1>me and Kevin James.</v>

722
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting around after the show and we're shaking her head where like God</v>

723
00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:50.911
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

724
00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:51.630
<v Speaker 1>he's good.</v>

725
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.463
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

726
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.770
<v Speaker 1>He apparently did two different hours on a Friday night.</v>

727
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.480
<v Speaker 1>He did two shows in eight and a 10,</v>

728
00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.550
<v Speaker 1>two completely different hours,</v>

729
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.710
<v Speaker 1>completely top to bottom.</v>

730
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.230
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

731
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.290
<v Speaker 1>is both of them or slaughtering?</v>

732
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.730
<v Speaker 1>He has just a destroyer running writer.</v>

733
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:10.590
<v Speaker 1>I remember feeling like what he could take premises that you didn't think there</v>

734
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:13.680
<v Speaker 1>was anything there and you could turn them into like one of your favorite bits.</v>

735
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Like you did a premise about buying a corvette and the guy tried to talk them</v>

736
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:18.690
<v Speaker 1>into all sorts of stuff in the corvette.</v>

737
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.610
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking while he was doing this,</v>

738
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:21.170
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

739
00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:22.770
<v Speaker 1>how is this guy going to make this funny?</v>

740
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.490
<v Speaker 1>This is talking about buying an expensive sports car and he's gonna figure out</v>

741
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:27.820
<v Speaker 1>how to make this funny number,</v>

742
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.830
<v Speaker 1>the ref thing he did.</v>

743
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.200
<v Speaker 1>I had a bunch of great the football,</v>

744
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:31.140
<v Speaker 1>we know he,</v>

745
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:31.951
<v Speaker 1>we have problems,</v>

746
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:32.784
<v Speaker 1>him and I,</v>

747
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 1>and it really was because of him.</v>

748
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:36.220
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying that clearly.</v>

749
00:18:36.221 --> 00:18:36.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

750
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

751
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.213
<v Speaker 1>because he's dead.</v>

752
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:38.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

753
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.350
<v Speaker 1>but what happened was we were like getting different things at the same time.</v>

754
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.200
<v Speaker 1>You know each other.</v>

755
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Well he was competitive with me and I think,</v>

756
00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:51.950
<v Speaker 1>cause people pitted us against each other purely because we were short Italians</v>

757
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.670
<v Speaker 1>while I'm a short Italian as well.</v>

758
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.100
<v Speaker 1>But you've never been nothing but supportive and Nice,</v>

759
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 1>tight Joseph.</v>

760
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:58.500
<v Speaker 1>But I mean nothing.</v>

761
00:18:58.501 --> 00:18:59.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

762
00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

763
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.510
<v Speaker 1>one time I said to him,</v>

764
00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.020
<v Speaker 1>because there was,</v>

765
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:01.710
<v Speaker 1>somebody was talking about,</v>

766
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.921
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

767
00:19:01.921 --> 00:19:03.210
<v Speaker 1>why don't we go out on the road together?</v>

768
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

769
00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:04.680
<v Speaker 1>we'll fill up theaters.</v>

770
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:05.101
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

771
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:06.090
<v Speaker 1>why would I want to do that?</v>

772
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

773
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:07.580
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

774
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Make money to have fun.</v>

775
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.241
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

776
00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:10.680
<v Speaker 1>he didn't understand the concept.</v>

777
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

778
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.510
<v Speaker 1>He said to me one time,</v>

779
00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:12.751
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

780
00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Montreal comedy festival.</v>

781
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:15.690
<v Speaker 1>You think I should go there?</v>

782
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

783
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.050
<v Speaker 1>go with the idea that you're going to meet beautiful girls.</v>

784
00:19:19.051 --> 00:19:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Go to great restaurants and then if you happen to get a deal you do but have</v>

785
00:19:22.381 --> 00:19:22.681
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

786
00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:23.520
<v Speaker 1>And he goes fun.</v>

787
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.211
<v Speaker 1>He looked at me like,</v>

788
00:19:24.211 --> 00:19:24.431
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

789
00:19:24.431 --> 00:19:25.170
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean fun?</v>

790
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:25.921
<v Speaker 1>This isn't fun.</v>

791
00:19:25.921 --> 00:19:26.754
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

792
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:27.750
<v Speaker 1>he was tortured.</v>

793
00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:28.763
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

794
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.360
<v Speaker 1>He never enjoyed it,</v>

795
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:30.810
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

796
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:31.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the saddest part of it.</v>

797
00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:32.070
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

798
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.450
<v Speaker 1>he never knew how good he was there.</v>

799
00:19:33.451 --> 00:19:34.860
<v Speaker 1>He never enjoyed how good he was.</v>

800
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I first met him in Montreal.</v>

801
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

802

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:47.250
<v Speaker 1>94 just so we were both passing each other and in the front doors just said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I usually apply first myself,</v>

850
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:34.680
<v Speaker 1>but I'm plying him.</v>

851
00:20:34.681 --> 00:20:35.320

857
00:20:38.581 --> 00:20:40.710
<v Speaker 1>ABC flew me and he didn't like that either.</v>

858
00:20:40.711 --> 00:20:41.041
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>

859
00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:41.541
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

860

<v Speaker 1>Do I that to rub it in?</v>

861
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.220
<v Speaker 1>And then I finally said to him,</v>

862
00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:44.521
<v Speaker 1>rich,</v>

863

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:46.410
<v Speaker 1>You want my cookie?</v>

865
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm just in first class.</v>

866
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Not a big fucking deal.</v>

867
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:50.230
<v Speaker 1>You guys are so Italian.</v>

868
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.580
<v Speaker 1>That's such an Italian.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I fucking cool.</v>

870
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.910
<v Speaker 1>They have the good Salami over there.</v>

871
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.090

00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:02.134
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

874
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.453
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough,</v>

875
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough lesson for those guys that are like super competitive and loaners.</v>

876
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:12.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough lesson as you start getting older that none of this shit is fun if</v>

877
00:21:12.491 --> 00:21:13.324
<v Speaker 1>you don't have friends.</v>

878
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

879
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.940
<v Speaker 1>You know what we're talking about?</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

883
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Jessie Mae Peluso,</v>

884
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.960
<v Speaker 1>we're all hanging out with the lab.</v>

885
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:26.794
<v Speaker 1>She's great.</v>

886
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:27.663
<v Speaker 1>She's so great,</v>

887
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.850
<v Speaker 1>but we're all laughing and having a great time and you know,</v>

888
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:31.900
<v Speaker 1>we're all comics,</v>

889
00:21:31.901 --> 00:21:32.440
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

890
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:32.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

891
00:21:32.531 --> 00:21:34.360
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's all about was to be like that.</v>

892
00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:34.751
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be,</v>

893
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:35.201
<v Speaker 1>we see each other,</v>

894
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:37.000
<v Speaker 1>we hug each other and decided,</v>

895
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I went to see the premiere of a Batman,</v>

896
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:40.630
<v Speaker 1>the very first one,</v>

897
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.840
<v Speaker 1>and Jack Nicholson was in it and he was at the bar and just fucking drink.</v>

898
00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's cheers where everybody and prince was there,</v>

899
00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:48.930
<v Speaker 1>this little little,</v>

900
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:49.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

901
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:50.850
<v Speaker 1>kind of faggoty prints go,</v>

902
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.641
<v Speaker 1>whatever you say.</v>

903
00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Faggoty Shit.</v>

904
00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:54.360
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

905
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.193
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

906
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.921
<v Speaker 1>he's sitting there,</v>

907
00:21:56.921 --> 00:21:57.191
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

908
00:21:57.191 --> 00:22:00.280
<v Speaker 1>he's got two body guards sitting in front of me sitting there and he's not,</v>

909
00:22:00.281 --> 00:22:00.821
<v Speaker 1>and I'm thinking,</v>

910
00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:01.654
<v Speaker 1>what fun is it?</v>

911
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you talk to somebody?</v>

912
00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:04.360
<v Speaker 1>It feels like royalty though.</v>

913
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guy named himself prince,</v>

914
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.360
<v Speaker 1>how shocking is that?</v>

915
00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:10.900
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be treated like royalty with giant men guarding his flesh.</v>

916
00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:11.743
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

917
00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.260
<v Speaker 1>These P,</v>

918
00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.100
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

919
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.680
<v Speaker 1>he's got to get into my car.</v>

920
00:22:14.681 --> 00:22:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I have an idea.</v>

921
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.440
<v Speaker 1>He had some high heels on it too.</v>

922
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I guess he wrote the music for that.</v>

923
00:22:19.301 --> 00:22:20.134
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

924
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.440
<v Speaker 1>it just struck me about the here's Nicholson easily,</v>

925
00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:25.390
<v Speaker 1>just as famous if not more than him.</v>

926
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.220
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

927
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.490
<v Speaker 1>and he was like miserable.</v>

928
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson's all having fun.</v>

929
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

930
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:31.820
<v Speaker 1>you know the person,</v>

931
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:33.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

932
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:38.590
<v Speaker 1>I taught fourth grade and now those kids are grown ups and that's really cool</v>

933
00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.480
<v Speaker 1>because some of them told me it was the best year of their lives.</v>

934
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.100
<v Speaker 1>They come to see me do stand up.</v>

935
00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:43.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

936
00:22:43.881 --> 00:22:44.511
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

937
00:22:44.511 --> 00:22:44.961
<v Speaker 1>Very cool.</v>

938
00:22:44.961 --> 00:22:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Will you teach and what fourth grade until you know everything but all fourth</v>

939
00:22:48.081 --> 00:22:49.730
<v Speaker 1>graders like different than science,</v>

940
00:22:49.731 --> 00:22:50.420
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

941
00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

942
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:50.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

943
00:22:50.901 --> 00:22:54.590
<v Speaker 1>it's different than what you did because you went to set people who had like an</v>

944
00:22:54.591 --> 00:22:57.710
<v Speaker 1>interest and a love for something and when to to explore it.</v>

945
00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:58.520
<v Speaker 1>You weren't,</v>

946
00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.180
<v Speaker 1>you were doing,</v>

947
00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.050
<v Speaker 1>but mine is different.</v>

948
00:23:00.051 --> 00:23:00.920
<v Speaker 1>They had to be there.</v>

949
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.440
<v Speaker 1>So my thing was self doubt,</v>

950
00:23:03.441 --> 00:23:04.274
<v Speaker 1>self esteem.</v>

951
00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I figure I can't teach these subjects are going to come and go in and lives,</v>

952
00:23:07.671 --> 00:23:11.240
<v Speaker 1>but teaching them self esteem and some of the most rewarding things were like,</v>

953
00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:11.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

954
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.100
<v Speaker 1>I had this one kid who was real shy.</v>

955
00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:14.030
<v Speaker 1>He was so shy,</v>

956
00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.550
<v Speaker 1>he was real tall and he was embarrassed by it.</v>

957
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.800
<v Speaker 1>And he would stay in the SEL in the cloak,</v>

958
00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:19.611
<v Speaker 1>cloak room,</v>

959
00:23:19.611 --> 00:23:20.444
<v Speaker 1>they'd call it,</v>

960
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:21.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

961
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:22.900
<v Speaker 1>where all the coats and he'd just stay in there.</v>

962
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.250
<v Speaker 1>And when to come out I go sky,</v>

963
00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.370
<v Speaker 1>it was to calm sky king because he was a space cadet goes sky,</v>

964
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:28.223
<v Speaker 1>you got to come out.</v>

965
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.121
<v Speaker 1>He can't stay.</v>

966
00:23:29.121 --> 00:23:30.620
<v Speaker 1>I can't let a kid just sitting,</v>

967
00:23:30.621 --> 00:23:31.390
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

968
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:36.390
<v Speaker 1>And by the end of me just like work in his self esteem and all.</v>

969
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.240
<v Speaker 1>He was in the middle of the class,</v>

970
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.190
<v Speaker 1>just what everybody else waving his hand.</v>

971
00:23:40.191 --> 00:23:44.210
<v Speaker 1>And his mother came up to me and she was like really touched by it and told me</v>

972
00:23:44.211 --> 00:23:46.430
<v Speaker 1>that I changed his and then you know,</v>

973
00:23:46.431 --> 00:23:47.540
<v Speaker 1>that kind of Shit's cool.</v>

974
00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:50.480
<v Speaker 1>And now I got like a couple of the girls come to see me as she goes,</v>

975
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.553
<v Speaker 1>one of the girls goes,</v>

976
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.330

<v Speaker 1>Turner or why did you let us do so much stuff?</v>

978
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.401
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

983

993
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.460
<v Speaker 1>that's why you ran the class,</v>
