20
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't fucked one until recently.</v>

21
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Speaker 1>I just went back to fucking one and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was nice.</v>

22
00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 1>It was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I took the vacation </v>

23
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>because I went for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was spitting up my hands,</v>

24
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>making myself have yeast infections and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this shit.</v>

25
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>It don't use spit after eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

26
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>You've made yourself have a use and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think I did.</v>

27
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:14.571
<v Speaker 1>I think I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some mashed potatoes in your </v>

28
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>hand are so lazy with my lotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So nasty.</v>

29
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>You are so nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He spit in your hand.</v>

30
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>You gave yourself a yeast infection on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

31
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

32
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.420
<v Speaker 1>From too much breadsticks anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do what he does and clean your </v>

33
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>flashlight too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be disgusting.</v>

34
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.260
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With like cantaloupes recently where </v>

35
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.660
<v Speaker 1>people were dying from like bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>cantaloupes,</v>

36
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>there were fucking bad cantaloupes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating them,</v>

37
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:40.851
<v Speaker 1>but then I was just wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to extrapolate like what </v>

38
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:40.851
<v Speaker 1>will happen if you fucked up bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>cantaloupe.</v>

39
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

40
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Because Cantaloupe is probably the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature's backup to the fleshlight,</v>

41
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many different people do you think?</v>

42
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:53.181
<v Speaker 1>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the numbers of people that are </v>

43
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:53.181
<v Speaker 1>fucked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cantaloupes?</v>

44
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:53.181
<v Speaker 1>I think there's bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're young,</v>

45
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:54.390
<v Speaker 1>you would try anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I fucked pillows and then I sleep</v>

46
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:59.991
<v Speaker 1>so it's like hump things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll get elaborate if you want to </v>

48
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>carve a correct size hole into a piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of fruit.</v>

49
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just out of curiosity,</v>

50
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>how many people do you think of fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>cantaloupes?</v>

51
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Cantaloupe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say at least two out of 10 </v>

52
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>people and I'm like all time numbers as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it a million,</v>

53
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>half a million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty three,</v>

54
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>53.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've gone through it,</v>

55
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:26.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of people have probably </v>

56
00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:26.151
<v Speaker 1>looked at the cantaloupe and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk and fuck it,</v>

57
00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe look for an apple core.</v>

58
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't find it or tried to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole circular hole with a knife and it </v>

59
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.660
<v Speaker 1>didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

60
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

61
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.360
<v Speaker 1>But how many people actually went ahead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucked it and came inside the </v>

62
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.360
<v Speaker 1>cantaloupe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want the numbers.</v>

63
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm biased because I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think everyone has,</v>

64
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shut a load into account.</v>

65
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Speaker 1>I remember I put it in the microwave </v>
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

66
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

67
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Nice and hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always used heat too.</v>

68
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I think about masturbating,</v>

69
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I have to have heat involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like to live in Ohio.</v>

70
00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:59.401
<v Speaker 1>It was freezing all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever fucked a girl by mistake </v>

71
00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>by using the back oil you put on back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That heats up.</v>

72
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>You accidentally use it for lube to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>a girl in the ass.</v>

73
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that.</v>

74
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Ruins it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they run to the bathroom crying and </v>

75
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>my goodness so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hot oil lotions just for your bag.</v>

76
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Don't put it in an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell me that.</v>

77
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>This is a real story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super real.</v>

78
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>I've done it multiple times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I say,</v>

79
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposedly really nasty is a.</v>

80
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>If you fill the tub with champagne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a lady gets into it,</v>

81
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>it would just burn the shit out of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A tutor out over stuff.</v>

82
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

83
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>That supposedly happened in Natalie Wood</v>
<v Speaker 1>one time.</v>

84
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's funny.</v>

85
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:44.791
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Dennis Hopper used to tell this </v>

86
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:44.791
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's happening.</v>

87
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:46.910
<v Speaker 1>A lot of hood parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

88
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Come on like you don't think Birdman has</v>
<v Speaker 1>parties,</v>

89
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>whereas bathtubs full of champagne and </v>
<v Speaker 1>checks and just climbing in and and </v>

90
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 1>booty poppin inside the tub filled the </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

91
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Of course they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

92
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>we're telling you those girls ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get your kutuchief chucked out,</v>

93
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 1>get some anti yeast infection type </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation going there.</v>

94
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:11.730
<v Speaker 1>That's dangerous stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martinelli's,</v>

95
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.860
<v Speaker 1>sparkling apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that would probably </v>

96
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.811
<v Speaker 1>burn also?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that would like not burn because </v>

97
00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:18.811
<v Speaker 1>it's not alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

98
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe picking everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would just make everything </v>

99
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>smell nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

100
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I like that taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would be good.</v>

101
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 1>It could be a positive and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>apple cider,</v>

102
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's the fleshlight commercial and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>get yourself a flashlight.</v>

104
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.920

<v Speaker 1>To beat on a lot of controversy on this </v>

105
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.920
<v Speaker 1>new commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They go fuck themselves.</v>

107
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Controversy.</v>

108
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.370
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have been tweeting me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't know what to tell you.</v>

109

111
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not really commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

112
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a commercial doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got it out of the way.</v>

115
00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:59.950
<v Speaker 1>It's the best way to do a commercial </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>

116
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 1>It's really not that big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know we were doing a </v>

117
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>commercial pre show chat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking entertaining.</v>

183
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.350
<v Speaker 3>deal with caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people.</v>

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never know.</v>

187
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Are you a caffeine guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

188
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:32.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying it's not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

189
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm completely off of caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can have it every once in a while </v>

190
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:37.390
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

191
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.290
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you not go with caffeine because </v>

192
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 3>caffeine kills your boss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>

193
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:42.880
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

194
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:43.810
<v Speaker 3>I'll have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

195
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 3>of like a fancy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this time of year I'll like to have</v>

196
00:08:46.251 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 3>like a Pumpkin latte every once in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while or something.</v>

197
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.010
<v Speaker 3>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really.</v>

198
00:08:51.011 --> 00:08:56.011
<v Speaker 3>I just not a coffee person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm more specifically not a diet </v>

199
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:56.011
<v Speaker 3>diet soda person anymore.</v>

200
00:08:56.011 --> 00:09:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I got totally off of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever tried energy drinks or do </v>

201
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.530
<v Speaker 1>you stay away from all that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

202
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 1>I just go with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 1>whatever your natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm tired,</v>

204
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:10.650
<v Speaker 1>that's time to go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a smart way.</v>

205
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm usually not in a position where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to force myself to stay up,</v>

206
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:16.530
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's sort of keeps me,</v>

207
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a sativa,</v>

208
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:22.731
<v Speaker 1>it sort of keeps me up anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just avoid all stimulants pretty </v>

209
00:09:22.731 --> 00:09:23.490
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drink alcohol,</v>

210
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:24.180
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

211
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a depressant though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

212
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

213
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean just in terms of.</v>

214
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever fuck with that are wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

215
00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:30.950
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

216
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.730
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

217
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really haven't fucked with </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

218
00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:38.541
<v Speaker 1>I've only done mushrooms a few times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he a couple of times and that's about </v>

219
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:40.680
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm mostly just pot and alcohol.</v>

220
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.210
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people love that.</v>

221
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Adderall man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people loved that for getting </v>

222
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 1>shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I could get a supply of it,</v>

223
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:48.790
<v Speaker 1>I would probably take it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

224
00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Speaker 1>but not even going to look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How damaging do you think it is for you?</v>

225
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I know.</v>

226
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.850
<v Speaker 1>I think if you use it in moderation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it seems like it's one of those </v>

227
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.280
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of hard to use in moderation</v>
<v Speaker 1>leg it a lot.</v>

228
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.110
<v Speaker 1>I think Brian's the kind of guy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

229
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.840
<v Speaker 1>like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I like masturbate,</v>

230
00:10:05.841 --> 00:10:08.010
<v Speaker 1>it's usually like I can go to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>right after that,</v>

231
00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:13.011
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagined Brian underwood masturbate </v>

232
00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:13.170
<v Speaker 1>and then want to stay up late enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to masturbate again.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

241
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:39.100
<v Speaker 2>it just the way it helps me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me feel like my brain works </v>

242
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.540
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me feel cleaner,</v>

243
00:10:40.541 --> 00:10:45.541
<v Speaker 2>like have a little bit more energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more like it feels like </v>

244
00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:46.390
<v Speaker 2>things are firing better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

245
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.910
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of different interesting</v>

246
00:10:48.911 --> 00:10:52.120
<v Speaker 2>ingredients in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them have been used by people for</v>

247
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.160
<v Speaker 2>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not thousands of years.</v>

248
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.480
<v Speaker 2>And it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's basically vitamins for brain </v>

249
00:10:59.480 --> 00:10:59.480
<v Speaker 2>function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

250
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.110
<v Speaker 2>I bet it doesn't feel like it'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you've ever like,</v>

251
00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:03.850
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need some that now.</v>

252
00:11:03.851 --> 00:11:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

253
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:05.560
<v Speaker 2>get hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

254
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:06.460
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

255
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have that profound effect,</v>

256
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:10.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite honestly,</v>

257
00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:12.310
<v Speaker 2>it's like most vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

258
00:11:12.311 --> 00:11:15.130
<v Speaker 2>I believe in vitamins and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very important to take care of your body</v>

259
00:11:15.131 --> 00:11:16.780
<v Speaker 2>and give it a lot of nutrients and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

260
00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.200
<v Speaker 2>But most vitamins don't have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate effect.</v>

261
00:11:20.201 --> 00:11:21.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took vitamins.</v>

262
00:11:21.191 --> 00:11:26.191
<v Speaker 2>You just know you have an overall sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what I'm doing the right thing and </v>

263
00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:30.481
<v Speaker 2>I'm putting good food in my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you might feel like you have </v>

264
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:33.961
<v Speaker 2>like a little bit more energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the effects of having a lack of </v>

265
00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:34.370
<v Speaker 2>nutrients there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

266
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.810
<v Speaker 2>it's slow and long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you take vitamins and then</v>

267
00:11:37.811 --> 00:11:41.270
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden I feel amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

268
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:45.760
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do have a good nutritional base,</v>

269
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.320
<v Speaker 2>you will feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

270
00:11:47.321 --> 00:11:52.321
<v Speaker 2>if you are taking nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body will be working better and it </v>

271
00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:52.810
<v Speaker 2>will work better and this works along </v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

272
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are nutrients that help your brain</v>

273
00:11:57.071 --> 00:11:59.320
<v Speaker 2>function and how they help you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

274
00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm in.</v>

275
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to try them anyway.</v>

276
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:08.161
<v Speaker 2>If you go to Joe Rogan.net</v>
<v Speaker 2>and click on the link for Alpha brain </v>

277
00:12:08.161 --> 00:12:09.440
<v Speaker 2>and enter the code name Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will get 10 percent off and then you</v>

278
00:12:09.441 --> 00:12:12.120
<v Speaker 2>can get your freak on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd get rubber pussies.</v>

279
00:12:12.121 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 2>You get yourself some brain pills.</v>

280
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.070
<v Speaker 1>We're still doing commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to complain about this.</v>

281
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.520
<v Speaker 1>This is how we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be on the record.</v>

282
00:12:19.521 --> 00:12:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tweet you guys and long </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking commercial,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest,</v>

286
00:12:37.461 --> 00:12:42.461
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why that commercial went so </v>

287
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:42.470
<v Speaker 1>long is we're way too high to be talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly.</v>

288
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was ridiculous.</v>

289
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

294
00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.400
<v Speaker 1>We're going to give it another few </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes because it stills has read about</v>

295
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.180
<v Speaker 1>it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it takes like 10 minutes.</v>

296
00:13:05.181 --> 00:13:10.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a vaporizer slash pong type </v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like that was.</v>

316
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.860

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

349
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.900
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea of what a lot of girls </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now that are getting angry at this</v>

350
00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:22.480
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tastes like bread.</v>

351
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

352
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.900

<v Speaker 1>fish bread.</v>

353
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.260
<v Speaker 1>This is a subject that makes women </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>

354
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:35.430
<v Speaker 1>It makes them really angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about if you're a fucking a </v>

355
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.950
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they get like a urinary track </v>

356
00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:38.950
<v Speaker 1>infection where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

357
00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:38.950
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

358
00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:39.780
<v Speaker 1>that's where the legs just juicing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

<v Speaker 1>vinegar or something.</v>

361
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.910
<v Speaker 1>We'll see why women wouldn't enjoy this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

362
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Has got to be tough to take care of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

363
00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much maintenance.</v>

364
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.930
<v Speaker 1>It's the difference between washing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>car and being a mechanic.</v>

365
00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:02.350
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like men just have to keep their </v>

366
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:02.350
<v Speaker 1>fucking car washed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>for loads for their fucking Kangaroos,</v>

372
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.800

375
00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:26.690
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the vagina.</v>

393
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.600

<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

394
00:17:08.601 --> 00:17:11.000
<v Speaker 1>have always trying to be home for a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

396
00:17:16.001 --> 00:17:19.780
<v Speaker 1>stay home for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just sort of does the go away for a </v>

397
00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.450
<v Speaker 1>couple days and come back is the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

398
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.090
<v Speaker 1>When people go out for like three months</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a time,</v>

399
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.090
<v Speaker 1>all they do is tour that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't like.</v>

400
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.110
<v Speaker 1>You might as well be in a band if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do that,</v>

401
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:27.850
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

402
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:32.320

<v Speaker 1>you know where he and all those guys and</v>

403
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Bobby Kelly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three poor guy.</v>

404
00:17:34.061 --> 00:17:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all went to and toured around.</v>

405
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.170
<v Speaker 1>I call those guys and I felt so bad for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them having like,</v>

406
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:46.210
<v Speaker 1>because they do stuff like today we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go ride horses to see what </v>

407
00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:50.111
<v Speaker 1>wackiness happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Robert Kelly falls off the </v>

408
00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:50.111
<v Speaker 1>fucking horse and breaks his arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

409
00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:50.111
<v Speaker 1>It's just</v>

410
00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:50.720
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

411
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.860
<v Speaker 3>you didn't even need to go horse back </v>
<v Speaker 3>riding.</v>

412
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:58.090
<v Speaker 3>You could have just been hanging out in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a condo like you would if you were out </v>

413
00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.590
<v Speaker 3>doing your own gig somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

414
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was,</v>

415
00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did Robert Kelly break his arm,</v>

416
00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.590
<v Speaker 3>twisted it or something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a.</v>

417
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.870
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because during a lot of tour guides him,</v>

418
00:18:08.871 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 3>he has some sort of cast or sleeping on </v>
<v Speaker 3>his arm I think.</v>

419
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Is that what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember there was like an audio that </v>

420
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:16.800
<v Speaker 3>they were planning on opening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthony was talking about his knee,</v>

421
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.850
<v Speaker 3>right leg hurt his knee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He broke his leg.</v>

422
00:18:18.851 --> 00:18:19.890
<v Speaker 3>I broke my knee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

423
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.470
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably need man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

424
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

425
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe I'm just confusing </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

426
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.420
<v Speaker 3>but those guys that had to be really </v>
<v Speaker 3>stressful to go on the road.</v>

427
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.730
<v Speaker 3>I only did it once with that Charlie </v>
<v Speaker 3>Murphy thing,</v>

428
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.630
<v Speaker 3>me and Charlie Murphy and John Drawn and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

429
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:40.820
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was not the most fun because we </v>

430
00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:40.920
<v Speaker 3>weren't doing well like ticket sales.</v>

431
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 3>We didn't do well in a lot of places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the promotion wasn't the best,</v>

432
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.360
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of people had no idea we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>even in their towns.</v>

433
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:53.520
<v Speaker 3>It turned out that we only did well in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the places where I already did well and </v>

434
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.350
<v Speaker 3>Charlie already did well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't really like a good,</v>

435
00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.070
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a really well produced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of such a blur too.</v>

436
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.450
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't remember anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember what city was?</v>

437
00:19:03.451 --> 00:19:06.870
<v Speaker 3>What and what club was what it did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And unfortunately,</v>

438
00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:08.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was before social media.</v>

439
00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.580
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have like twitter or anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

440
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Imagine us having this stream show </v>
<v Speaker 3>during that.</v>

441
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been so fun.</v>

442
00:19:14.701 --> 00:19:15.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had been really fun.</v>

443
00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.350
<v Speaker 3>It had to be in a different town and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were literally in a different town.</v>

444
00:19:19.351 --> 00:19:21.270
<v Speaker 3>Every night we would wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stare at the ceiling,</v>

445
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:21.990
<v Speaker 3>going to fuck.</v>

446
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Where am I chose?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were asked to blur together for sure.</v>

447
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:30.051
<v Speaker 3>The hotels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>airlines and the airports and the shows </v>

448
00:19:30.051 --> 00:19:30.150
<v Speaker 3>were awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just wasn't,</v>

449
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.970
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a financial success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't do well.</v>

450
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.490
<v Speaker 3>The only place it only did well and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>half the places.</v>

451
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.960
<v Speaker 3>Is there a city that you don't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>performing in?</v>

452
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:41.220
<v Speaker 3>Like you just think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

453
00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.510
<v Speaker 3>the crowd's always suck there because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people always asked me about that.</v>

454
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:49.540
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always have a great time everywhere I </v>

455
00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:49.540
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you bring your own people now,</v>

456
00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true for us as an opening act for</v>

457
00:19:51.361 --> 00:19:52.890
<v Speaker 3>other comics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always,</v>

458
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.910
<v Speaker 3>I never was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

459
00:19:53.911 --> 00:19:55.140
<v Speaker 3>this city's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

460
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:58.020
<v Speaker 3>they don't like me as much as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other cities,</v>

461
00:19:58.021 --> 00:20:00.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes you get a bad crowd,</v>

462
00:20:00.211 --> 00:20:03.720
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find I don't find one city to be like,</v>

463
00:20:03.721 --> 00:20:04.380
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that place,</v>

464
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.210
<v Speaker 3>the crowds are always really stupid.</v>

465
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some places they skew old,</v>

466
00:20:09.031 --> 00:20:11.820
<v Speaker 3>like I don't do well at Atlantic city </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the crowds are just too old.</v>

467
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.320
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just like,</v>

468
00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:14.690
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is he talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

469
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.300
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

470
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

471
00:20:16.861 --> 00:20:18.930
<v Speaker 3>Atlantic city is a tricky place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

472
00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.210
<v Speaker 3>That's a tricky place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done that.</v>

473
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:26.240
<v Speaker 3>What does that big theater there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did that at the Borgata did that a </v>

474
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:26.730
<v Speaker 3>couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a tricky place.</v>

475
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.830
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of old people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a strange thing.</v>

476
00:20:28.831 --> 00:20:31.560
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like trying to be Vegas,</v>

477
00:20:31.561 --> 00:20:34.590
<v Speaker 3>but it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a hair seedier.</v>

478
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.600
<v Speaker 3>Just a hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weirder hair,</v>

479
00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 3>more possibility of murdering the hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a hair more,</v>

480
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:42.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

481
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:47.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's caters to adapt to New Jersey and </v>

482
00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Philadelphia and you</v>

483
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.150
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything around there.</v>

484
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's more like a localized,</v>

485
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.050
<v Speaker 4>like people come from all over the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>for Vegas,</v>

486
00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:55.210
<v Speaker 4>but if someone's coming from really far </v>
<v Speaker 4>away,</v>

487
00:20:55.211 --> 00:20:57.090
<v Speaker 4>why are they going to Atlantic city?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'd be,</v>

488
00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:57.880
<v Speaker 4>that'd be a weird choice.</v>

489
00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.770
<v Speaker 2>And Atlantic city's essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by dangerous cities.</v>

490
00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:07.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas is essentially in the middle of </v>

491
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:07.060
<v Speaker 2>nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

492
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:07.060
<v Speaker 2>you'd get past bar stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is it?</v>

493
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.330
<v Speaker 2>It's just a bunch of weird towns that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't make any sense.</v>

494
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:14.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that drive to Vegas is the real America </v>

495
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:14.700
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

496
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:14.700
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a strange drive.</v>

497
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.860
<v Speaker 2>But that drove to Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the real America Atlantic city.</v>

498
00:21:16.861 --> 00:21:18.960
<v Speaker 2>You have to go through Camden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

499
00:21:18.961 --> 00:21:21.210
<v Speaker 2>you pass through the outskirts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>south Philly,</v>

500
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:21.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

501
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:27.090
<v Speaker 2>There's like a lot of places around </v>
<v Speaker 2>around Atlantic city that are filled </v>

502
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:27.090
<v Speaker 2>with</v>

503
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.660
<v Speaker 2>like serious criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

504
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean they had a fucking big billboard </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Newark when we were there for the UFC</v>

505
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.750
<v Speaker 2>big billboard that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop killing the teachers.</v>

506
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Stop killing the teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a big teacher cleaning going </v>

507
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:47.250
<v Speaker 2>on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

508
00:21:47.251 --> 00:21:49.320
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that there must be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

509
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:54.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise why would you make a goddamn </v>

510
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.590
<v Speaker 2>billboard about it saying stop killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the teachers and then,</v>

511
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my joke of course was the people who are</v>

512
00:21:56.011 --> 00:21:57.480
<v Speaker 2>killing the teachers probably can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>read.</v>

513
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:03.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really helping and by the way </v>

514
00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:03.650
<v Speaker 2>they're going to look at that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

515
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.450
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mighty had killed the teacher.</v>

516
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Encourage them a little bit like saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>scary,</v>

517
00:22:10.741 --> 00:22:13.140
<v Speaker 2>scary place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Newark is a spooky place.</v>

518
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.000
<v Speaker 2>I lived in New York for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

519
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:20.960
<v Speaker 2>I lived there when I was a little kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I lived there again when I was </v>

520
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:20.960
<v Speaker 2>adult for I think about six months.</v>

521
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.130
<v Speaker 2>I stayed with my grandfather when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>first moved to New York,</v>

522
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:28.140
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't afford my own place and I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>signed by this management company and so</v>

523
00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.080
<v Speaker 2>I had to relocate to New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I just balls up,</v>

524
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:36.110
<v Speaker 2>pick up my shed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever money I had in the bank and </v>

525
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.330
<v Speaker 2>just went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was gone in like two weeks so I had to</v>

526
00:22:36.331 --> 00:22:40.260
<v Speaker 2>stay with my grandfather and he lived on</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Ninth Street in Newark,</v>

527
00:22:40.261 --> 00:22:42.180
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm telling you,</v>

528
00:22:42.181 --> 00:22:47.181
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might as well have been in another </v>

529
00:22:47.181 --> 00:22:47.181
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a crazy little spot.</v>

530
00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.310
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot going on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

531
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:54.410
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a completely different </v>

532
00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:54.410
<v Speaker 2>vibe.</v>

533
00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:54.960
<v Speaker 4>I've only gone through there on a train.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I.</v>

534
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I ever set foot in there.</v>

535
00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.110
<v Speaker 4>They did this thing called block</v>

536
00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.200
<v Speaker 2>busting and this is what they used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

537
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:05.340
<v Speaker 2>This is how real estate guys made money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a really devious practice.</v>

538
00:23:05.341 --> 00:23:07.380
<v Speaker 2>They would go into a neighborhood and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

539
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.750
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black people are moving in.</v>

540
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.230
<v Speaker 2>You better sell now because your </v>
<v Speaker 2>property value is going to crash.</v>

541
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.770
<v Speaker 2>By the time they move in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're,</v>

542
00:23:15.771 --> 00:23:17.520
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna lose your investment.</v>

543
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.970
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of people bought into it and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people just took off.</v>

544
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.010
<v Speaker 2>Sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

545
00:23:23.011 --> 00:23:25.560
<v Speaker 2>It crashed whole neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did it on purpose.</v>

546
00:23:25.561 --> 00:23:27.930
<v Speaker 2>They did it to try to make money and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfather was like,</v>

547
00:23:27.931 --> 00:23:29.790
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like black people.</v>

548
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:30.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stay right here.</v>

549
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:36.020
<v Speaker 2>This is my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought this house and he watched this </v>

550
00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.620
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood turned from being an all </v>
<v Speaker 2>Italian neighborhood to being an all </v>

551
00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.070
<v Speaker 2>black neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it became like all Spanish,</v>

552
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:46.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like various different kinds of people </v>

553
00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.000
<v Speaker 2>from Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from all different nationalities,</v>

554
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:52.001
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of Spanish people now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was really almost like a kid </v>

555
00:23:52.001 --> 00:23:55.100
<v Speaker 2>watched this whole thing where he was in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this old school America,</v>

556
00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:56.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 forties,</v>

557
00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:01.630
<v Speaker 2>and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden he's living in the </v>

558
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:02.060
<v Speaker 2>modern age where everything has just </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone crazy around them.</v>

559
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I Bet Mitt Romney's done some of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>blockbusting oh yeah.</v>

560
00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.350
<v Speaker 2>That seems like that's in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheelhouse.</v>

561
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Irritating blockbusting blockbusting for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus or blockbusting for Joseph Smith.</v>

562
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:19.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's A.</v>

563
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.450
<v Speaker 2>He's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's a swell guy.</v>

564
00:24:20.451 --> 00:24:21.590
<v Speaker 2>We're just joking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Folks.</v>

565
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mitt Romney's aces.</v>

566
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's asis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he says about a right now he's </v>

567
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Speaker 2>saying that they should just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone should just go ahead and go,</v>

568
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.960
<v Speaker 2>go bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all on all houses.</v>

569
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Everyone should just lose their house </v>
<v Speaker 2>and let the.</v>

570
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.940
<v Speaker 2>Let the market decide what happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

571
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:42.970
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his strategy is just let </v>

572
00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:42.980
<v Speaker 2>everybody don't loan any money to </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>

573
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Is that a real statement?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

574
00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:50.750
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let the foreclosure process happened.</v>

575
00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Just sit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like being raped,</v>

576
00:24:52.631 --> 00:24:56.180
<v Speaker 2>like just lay back and let it happen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't struggle.</v>

577
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.580
<v Speaker 2>The ultimate acceptance that as a unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're only as strong as our weakest </v>

578
00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.340
<v Speaker 2>link.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you have to have.</v>

579
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:10.580
<v Speaker 2>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're working towards things as the </v>

580
00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.611
<v Speaker 2>leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're supposed to be the number one </v>

581
00:25:12.611 --> 00:25:12.680
<v Speaker 2>guide that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're at the top calling all the shots.</v>

582
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:17.310
<v Speaker 2>The number one thing you have to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>care of is the weakest of the links.</v>

583
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.490
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the people that are fucked up,</v>

584
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:22.400
<v Speaker 2>the weakest of the links that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are down and out,</v>

585
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:27.401
<v Speaker 2>the people that are homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that don't know where their </v>

586
00:25:27.401 --> 00:25:27.500
<v Speaker 2>next meal's coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to take care of them.</v>

587
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.240
<v Speaker 2>You got to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

588
00:25:29.241 --> 00:25:34.241
<v Speaker 2>and the politics of this country is </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people are not paying for the </v>

589
00:25:34.241 --> 00:25:38.531
<v Speaker 2>politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not making the contributions </v>

590
00:25:38.531 --> 00:25:41.720
<v Speaker 2>that racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Racist is a lot of poor white people.</v>

591
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The poverty level or company level,</v>

592
00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:44.980
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

593
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.490
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

594
00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.590
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>White,</v>

595
00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:50.540
<v Speaker 2>white or black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter.</v>

596
00:25:50.541 --> 00:25:53.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about people that are in despair,</v>

597
00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and friendly.</v>

598
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.260
<v Speaker 2>One to say that they should just suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

599
00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:02.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people can't do it on their own </v>

600
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:02.440
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people need a little help.</v>

601
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.110
<v Speaker 2>So when people need to be shown how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

602
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:08.111
<v Speaker 2>we need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need a nation with someone who's an </v>

603
00:26:08.111 --> 00:26:11.171
<v Speaker 2>actual guide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who can offer real guidance and </v>

604
00:26:11.171 --> 00:26:13.880
<v Speaker 2>now they're not doing that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a money grab.</v>

605
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:19.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a money grab by all these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate whores and all these people </v>

606
00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:23.020
<v Speaker 2>who have paid for these politicians to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in place and paid for these laws to </v>

607
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.681
<v Speaker 2>be in place or just reaping the profits </v>
<v Speaker 2>while the rest of us freak the fuck out </v>

608
00:26:26.681 --> 00:26:30.401
<v Speaker 2>because we can't figure out why the </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources are going the way they're </v>

609
00:26:30.401 --> 00:26:30.401
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

610
00:26:30.401 --> 00:26:30.500
<v Speaker 2>We were going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you there?</v>

611
00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we have 100,000</v>

612
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.670
<v Speaker 2>troops here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we have troops there?</v>

613
00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we conserve our fucking </v>

614
00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.580
<v Speaker 2>resources?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that the biggest section of our </v>

615
00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.411
<v Speaker 2>economy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does it have to be this military </v>

616
00:26:44.411 --> 00:26:44.411
<v Speaker 2>industrial complex?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we have be doing this,</v>

617
00:26:44.411 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 2>this idea to keep us safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep the fuck.</v>

618
00:26:47.551 --> 00:26:49.980
<v Speaker 2>Are you talking about man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep the troops here.</v>

619
00:26:49.981 --> 00:26:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Let them guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

620
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.520
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to keep us safe all over the</v>

621
00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:58.650
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have troops all over the outskirts of </v>

622
00:26:58.650 --> 00:26:58.650
<v Speaker 2>the fucking country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

623
00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.830
<v Speaker 2>That's how you keep safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have preemptive shit,</v>

624
00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:03.450
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know dude.</v>

625
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing freaks me out.</v>

626
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.230
<v Speaker 2>It freaks me out because I can't believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this bad in 2011,</v>

627
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.550
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to Robert Anton Wilson </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lecture and he was talking,</v>

628
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:19.551
<v Speaker 2>it was in 1993 and he was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how war is in the process of being </v>

629
00:27:20.161 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 2>phased out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

630
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:25.690
<v Speaker 2>and he was talking about how in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future it,</v>

631
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.860
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious obviously being phased out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wonder what he would've said now </v>

632
00:27:32.011 --> 00:27:33.720
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about that,</v>

633
00:27:33.721 --> 00:27:38.721
<v Speaker 2>like in 1993,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in 1993 I thought war was going to </v>

634
00:27:38.721 --> 00:27:38.721
<v Speaker 2>be phased out too.</v>

635
00:27:38.721 --> 00:27:40.080
<v Speaker 2>We all thought it was over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

636
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:45.230
<v Speaker 2>we got through that whole crazy desert </v>
<v Speaker 2>storm thing under Bush and all of a </v>

637
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:49.581
<v Speaker 2>sudden here we are and it's 2011 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazier than ever.</v>

638
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:51.800
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what he would have said them </v>
<v Speaker 2>get made.</v>

639
00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.310
<v Speaker 2>Is it being phased out because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't seem like it's being phased.</v>

640
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.100
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it</v>

641
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.070
<v Speaker 5>heating up like we may be pulling out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a couple places,</v>

642
00:27:58.071 --> 00:27:59.840
<v Speaker 5>but going into new ones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like,</v>

643
00:27:59.841 --> 00:28:04.100
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If there's something else going on,</v>

644
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.240
<v Speaker 5>let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

645
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:10.390
<v Speaker 5>If Indiana Jones is found the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>last temple and the Ark of the covenant </v>

646
00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:14.110
<v Speaker 5>is in there and you have to keep the bad</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys from getting to it because if not,</v>

647
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.280
<v Speaker 5>it'll be hell on earth and hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some snakes.</v>

648
00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:21.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking please let me know because </v>

649
00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:21.890
<v Speaker 5>otherwise this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise,</v>

650
00:28:21.891 --> 00:28:22.730
<v Speaker 5>this is crazy</v>

651
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.900
<v Speaker 2>and it's so obvious that there's money </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind all this shit.</v>

652
00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:28.490
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so obvious.</v>

653
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.510
<v Speaker 2>We live in the grossest most corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 2>country ever.</v>

654
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:34.460
<v Speaker 2>It's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not ever.</v>

655
00:28:34.461 --> 00:28:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kidding.</v>

656
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure a lot of Middle Eastern </v>

657
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:40.720
<v Speaker 2>countries and a lot of South American </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>

658
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:40.720
<v Speaker 2>they're</v>

659
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:40.780
<v Speaker 5>pretty corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Corrupt too,</v>

660
00:28:40.781 --> 00:28:43.420
<v Speaker 5>but the fact that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're this wonky.</v>

661
00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.430
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then everybody wants to stand up and</v>

662
00:28:45.431 --> 00:28:48.550
<v Speaker 5>say you get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should get up if you don't like you,</v>

663
00:28:48.551 --> 00:28:50.150
<v Speaker 5>you should leave Merck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

664
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.240
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many Rah Rah Rah fans out </v>

665
00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:55.840
<v Speaker 5>there not liking it as what the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>country has been built up.</v>

666
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.980
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the idea is that everybody,</v>

667
00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:04.020
<v Speaker 5>everybody gets to contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called the democracy and we're all </v>

668
00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.741
<v Speaker 5>supposed to participate and help one </v>
<v Speaker 5>another and now it's just like it's </v>

669
00:29:07.741 --> 00:29:11.860
<v Speaker 5>becoming so every man for himself that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the disparity between the richest,</v>

670
00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.570
<v Speaker 5>the richest one percent and the poorest </v>
<v Speaker 5>people is,</v>

671
00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:16.450
<v Speaker 5>it's just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The difference.</v>

672
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:22.550
<v Speaker 5>It's God damn money grab out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a money grab out there left and </v>

673
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:26.731
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So are all the occupies right now being </v>

674
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:26.731
<v Speaker 5>shut down like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

675
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:30.520
<v Speaker 5>I haven't been.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Each city's kind of treating it </v>

676
00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:30.520
<v Speaker 5>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

677
00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.201
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a few cities that are really </v>

678
00:29:34.201 --> 00:29:34.330
<v Speaker 5>embracing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in La it's not,</v>

679
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:37.360
<v Speaker 5>it's not really a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The original one I heard got shut down.</v>

680
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard some crazy shit that they were </v>

681
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.330
<v Speaker 5>keeping reporters out and they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>forcing reporters out of the area.</v>

682
00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:48.340
<v Speaker 5>They said it was for their own safety.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's insulting Bloomberg cleared,</v>

683
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:53.550
<v Speaker 4>but he out at eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all intense and they went </v>

684
00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.440
<v Speaker 4>through and told everybody they had 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes to get out at 1:00</v>

685
00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.180
<v Speaker 4>AM on a Tuesday and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

686
00:30:00.181 --> 00:30:05.181
<v Speaker 4>and then they used,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they used quite a bit of force to get </v>

687
00:30:05.181 --> 00:30:05.181
<v Speaker 4>everybody out of there and now they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>letting people back in,</v>

688
00:30:05.181 --> 00:30:10.021
<v Speaker 4>but they're saying they can't have tents</v>
<v Speaker 4>and sleeping bags like you can go back </v>

689
00:30:10.021 --> 00:30:12.751
<v Speaker 4>in and just stand there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea is they figure that that's </v>

690
00:30:12.751 --> 00:30:16.561
<v Speaker 4>going to kill the movement a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's getting so cold and they </v>

691
00:30:16.561 --> 00:30:20.430
<v Speaker 4>won't be able to lock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We will be able to last through the </v>

692
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.430
<v Speaker 4>winter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Bloomberg keeps saying it's a safety</v>

693
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:22.030
<v Speaker 4>issue that also that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

694
00:30:22.031 --> 00:30:27.031
<v Speaker 4>they have the right to peaceably </v>
<v Speaker 4>assemble but they don't have a right to </v>

695
00:30:27.031 --> 00:30:28.180
<v Speaker 4>have a tent or a sleeping bag,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is this kind of like,</v>

696
00:30:28.181 --> 00:30:33.181
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's so that they can assemble </v>

697
00:30:33.181 --> 00:30:33.181
<v Speaker 4>peacefully and not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

698
00:30:33.181 --> 00:30:35.620
<v Speaker 4>not just I'll freeze to death in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle of the fucking park in New York.</v>

699
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.690
<v Speaker 4>Like why would they want casualties </v>
<v Speaker 4>there?</v>

700
00:30:37.691 --> 00:30:42.691
<v Speaker 4>Why would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would they want people to suffer </v>

701
00:30:42.691 --> 00:30:42.691
<v Speaker 4>that much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

702
00:30:42.691 --> 00:30:45.750
<v Speaker 4>in order to just express their anger at </v>
<v Speaker 4>Wall Street.</v>

703
00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:51.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's fantastic that it's that,</v>

704
00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.260
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's happening everywhere,</v>

705
00:30:53.261 --> 00:30:53.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's,</v>

706
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's occupied dubuque and stuff like </v>

707
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.550
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also this new Bloomberg doing this,</v>

708
00:31:00.551 --> 00:31:02.740
<v Speaker 4>if he just let it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let it be it,</v>

709
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.920
<v Speaker 4>the movement might have died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it brought this whole new media </v>

710
00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.921
<v Speaker 4>storm and all these new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this new footage of cops just </v>

711
00:31:10.921 --> 00:31:12.520
<v Speaker 4>beating up these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people that,</v>

712
00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.070
<v Speaker 4>that don't look like hippies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not all in tie dye.</v>

713
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.800
<v Speaker 4>They're just people that are just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

714
00:31:17.801 --> 00:31:21.900
<v Speaker 4>concerned and showing up to you to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>up</v>

715
00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.790
<v Speaker 5>mark.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're holding hand by hand.</v>

716
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.400
<v Speaker 5>And did you see that video?</v>
<v Speaker 5>My brother wouldn't hit my hand.</v>

717
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:30.470
<v Speaker 5>That's just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe that as a,</v>

718
00:31:30.471 --> 00:31:32.800
<v Speaker 5>as a fellow person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just being able to do that too.</v>

719
00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:37.801
<v Speaker 5>Like that girl little girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What what he's saying is they were </v>

720
00:31:37.801 --> 00:31:37.801
<v Speaker 5>jabbing and with Bhutan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

721
00:31:37.801 --> 00:31:39.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Bloomberg,</v>

722
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:41.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he makes it all about as horrible.</v>

723
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:46.790
<v Speaker 4>He makes it all about keeping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keeping people of New York safe by </v>

724
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.010
<v Speaker 4>kicking everybody out of there and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like when they were in their tents,</v>

725
00:31:49.011 --> 00:31:50.240
<v Speaker 4>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was in danger?</v>

726
00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:51.770
<v Speaker 4>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But as soon as they're.</v>

727
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:55.430
<v Speaker 5>Well maybe he's worried about people </v>
<v Speaker 5>freezing to death.</v>

728
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.890
<v Speaker 5>Don't think he is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think ego problem.</v>

729
00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.580
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he is either,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is sort of a legal concern.</v>

730
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:05.030
<v Speaker 5>Someone freezes to death on your lawn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's responsible for that?</v>

731
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well it certainly not his lawn.</v>

732
00:32:07.731 --> 00:32:10.610
<v Speaker 5>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a public park that's privately</v>

733
00:32:10.611 --> 00:32:14.300
<v Speaker 5>owned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it by some corporation?</v>

734
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:18.770
<v Speaker 5>Is that public safety though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's just like our argument is that</v>

735
00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:23.820
<v Speaker 5>it's his argument was that people can </v>
<v Speaker 5>enjoy the park if the park is full of </v>

736
00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.480
<v Speaker 5>people that are just point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like,</v>

737
00:32:26.481 --> 00:32:29.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>New York City walk two blocks it.</v>

738
00:32:29.241 --> 00:32:30.820
<v Speaker 5>Enjoy that other park.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

739
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:33.710
<v Speaker 5>just one fucking park.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think what,</v>

740
00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>

741
00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:35.810
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

742
00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:36.840
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

743
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely two sides to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it just feels like,</v>

744
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.420
<v Speaker 6>it feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

745
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:47.170
<v Speaker 6>you know what Bloomberg did sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It sort of energize the movement in a </v>

746
00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.630
<v Speaker 6>way that it might not have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If he did,</v>

747
00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:50.330
<v Speaker 6>if he did just let it play out.</v>

748
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.330
<v Speaker 7>How would anybody expect them to behave </v>
<v Speaker 7>though?</v>

749
00:32:53.331 --> 00:32:58.331
<v Speaker 7>They've got to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 7>squash this and they have to take </v>

750
00:32:58.331 --> 00:32:59.270
<v Speaker 7>drastic measures.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's another go through the middle of</v>

751
00:32:59.271 --> 00:33:00.290
<v Speaker 7>the night.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everybody's fucking.</v>

752
00:33:00.291 --> 00:33:03.290
<v Speaker 7>There's no MDF sleep and they go in </v>
<v Speaker 7>there and just say,</v>

753
00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:06.260
<v Speaker 7>you got to go now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Get out with this footage of like cops,</v>

754
00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:11.460
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>lifting guys up and throwing them over </v>

755
00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:11.460
<v Speaker 7>the barricade stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

756
00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:11.660
<v Speaker 7>it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

757
00:33:11.661 --> 00:33:14.420
<v Speaker 7>in the cops for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I like to say they're doing what they're</v>

758
00:33:14.421 --> 00:33:15.200
<v Speaker 7>told to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't.</v>

759
00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:17.290
<v Speaker 7>I don't like to blame the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

760
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.410
<v Speaker 7>They're given what they're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're,</v>

761
00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:21.380
<v Speaker 7>they're doing what they're told to do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but when they're doing it,</v>

762
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.410
<v Speaker 7>all the sudden the people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>want to listen become the enemy.</v>

763
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:26.360
<v Speaker 7>They become bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

764
00:33:26.361 --> 00:33:28.610
<v Speaker 7>It's like a bouncer with a drunk person </v>
<v Speaker 7>in a class.</v>

765
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.730
<v Speaker 7>Like when that drunk person then it gets</v>
<v Speaker 7>violent.</v>

766
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.310
<v Speaker 7>People aren't bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They should like,</v>

767
00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.770
<v Speaker 7>like let them still occupy like the </v>
<v Speaker 7>trees,</v>

768
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:41.800
<v Speaker 7>like they should be allowed to like live</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the trees in the park so that the </v>

769
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:41.800
<v Speaker 7>park be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

770
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.450
<v Speaker 7>but then what if a hippie falls on you </v>
<v Speaker 7>while you're walking?</v>

771
00:33:43.451 --> 00:33:48.451
<v Speaker 7>You get some real safety issues.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They have to have some safety like chat </v>

772
00:33:48.451 --> 00:33:51.941
<v Speaker 7>people that check it out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then they become an [inaudible] and </v>

773
00:33:51.941 --> 00:33:53.410
<v Speaker 7>a couple months and then the idea is the</v>
<v Speaker 7>idea is to cause people.</v>

774
00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.770
<v Speaker 7>The idea is to cause some inconvenience </v>
<v Speaker 7>and draw some attention.</v>

775
00:33:57.771 --> 00:33:58.120
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

776
00:33:58.121 --> 00:33:59.660
<v Speaker 7>they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't.</v>

777
00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:04.810
<v Speaker 7>You don't like get together and protest </v>
<v Speaker 7>something and imagine that for politely </v>

778
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:09.580
<v Speaker 7>match.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If that's where swaths came from the </v>

779
00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:09.830
<v Speaker 7>originally people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they were just so fucking stupid.</v>

780
00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:12.380
<v Speaker 7>They eventually just became these claude</v>
<v Speaker 7>things.</v>

781
00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:17.390
<v Speaker 7>Just degenerated to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Imagine someone proved that slaw is </v>

782
00:34:18.621 --> 00:34:19.350
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

783
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.870
<v Speaker 7>that's like a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what sends the basics.</v>

784
00:34:21.871 --> 00:34:22.400
<v Speaker 7>Ends,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.590
<v Speaker 7>so I decided there's one in Burbank that</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've always driven bias.</v>

811
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:38.830
<v Speaker 7>I might check it out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe I can find a cool poster for the </v>

812
00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:38.830
<v Speaker 7>studio or something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I went in there and I just.</v>

813
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:44.030
<v Speaker 7>I was in there for like three hours is </v>
<v Speaker 7>the best story ever and a bunch of </v>

814
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.030
<v Speaker 7>stuff.</v>

815
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:45.210
<v Speaker 7>Bunch of just like random things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was so cheap.</v>

816
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 7>It was like posters were like $7.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

817
00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.980
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I never get a chance to brag about this,</v>

818
00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:52.080
<v Speaker 7>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I the very.</v>

819
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:55.110
<v Speaker 7>I worked at the arcade that had the very</v>
<v Speaker 7>first dragon's layer,</v>

820
00:35:55.111 --> 00:35:59.700
<v Speaker 7>the test one before it went public and I</v>
<v Speaker 7>probably killed the dragon.</v>

821
00:35:59.701 --> 00:36:04.701
<v Speaker 7>I was probably maybe the 30th or 40th </v>
<v Speaker 7>person in the world to get all the way </v>

822
00:36:04.701 --> 00:36:09.370
<v Speaker 7>to the end until the dragon because I </v>
<v Speaker 7>would stay at night when I was off duty </v>

823
00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:12.720
<v Speaker 7>and I had keys to the place and I would </v>
<v Speaker 7>just stay in there and play and play and</v>

824
00:36:12.721 --> 00:36:15.380
<v Speaker 7>play until I finally got to the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

825
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.400
<v Speaker 7>figured it all out and killed the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 7>and uh,</v>

826
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:19.950
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then eventually it went,</v>

827
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.040
<v Speaker 7>went public and that is amazing all over</v>
<v Speaker 7>the place.</v>

828
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.820
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nerd boner.</v>

829
00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.560
<v Speaker 7>I worked at an arcade called star port.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was in a mall,</v>

830
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.860
<v Speaker 7>but when you walked in there was all </v>
<v Speaker 7>this corrugated tin and stuff that </v>

831
00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.290
<v Speaker 7>simulate kind of like you're going into </v>
<v Speaker 7>like space mountain or something and </v>

832
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:37.560
<v Speaker 7>there's stars on the ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was,</v>

833
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:41.520
<v Speaker 7>it was kind of a cool themed arcade </v>
<v Speaker 7>refresh my memory,</v>

834
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:46.640
<v Speaker 7>because I remember the dragon's lear was</v>
<v Speaker 7>like this really cool animated thing </v>

835
00:36:46.741 --> 00:36:47.400
<v Speaker 7>where,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

836
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:48.680
<v Speaker 7>you would go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you would have,</v>

837
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:53.780
<v Speaker 7>but you would have to move certain ways.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a series of scenes that would </v>

838
00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.920
<v Speaker 7>happen on the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like an animated movie.</v>

839
00:36:55.921 --> 00:37:00.650
<v Speaker 7>It looked like a dog and you had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

840
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:03.870
<v Speaker 7>I think you had a regular toggle thing </v>
<v Speaker 7>and then a couple of buttons.</v>

841
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:04.340
<v Speaker 7>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

842
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:09.390
<v Speaker 7>it's a joystick and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>an action button and usually it started </v>

843
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.891
<v Speaker 7>off like you're walking down like a </v>
<v Speaker 7>bridge and then like a snake comes up </v>

844
00:37:12.891 --> 00:37:13.080
<v Speaker 7>and you have to think what would you </v>
<v Speaker 7>want to do?</v>

845
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.570
<v Speaker 7>Like either take the sword to the snake </v>
<v Speaker 7>or left.</v>

846
00:37:15.571 --> 00:37:20.571
<v Speaker 7>But it was more of a guessing game if </v>
<v Speaker 7>you had this more like you have to try </v>

847
00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:21.930
<v Speaker 7>every combination of things to do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like there's one part where you're like,</v>

848
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.180
<v Speaker 7>you're in a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a cave,</v>

849
00:37:24.181 --> 00:37:27.870
<v Speaker 7>roaring down the river in a raft or </v>
<v Speaker 7>something and it's like you have,</v>

850
00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:31.200
<v Speaker 7>you can go to the right of the left.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so if you toggle to the right,</v>

851
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:32.520
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

852
00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:37.530
<v Speaker 7>you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you'd go the rest of the way without </v>

853
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:37.530
<v Speaker 7>encountering anything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But if you go the other way,</v>

854
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:38.670
<v Speaker 7>something,</v>
<v Speaker 7>something goes wrong and you lose a life</v>

855
00:37:38.671 --> 00:37:40.080
<v Speaker 7>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>

856
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:44.920
<v Speaker 7>there's just a bunch of options through </v>
<v Speaker 7>the whole thing until finally you get to</v>

857
00:37:44.921 --> 00:37:46.440
<v Speaker 7>and kill the dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But yeah,</v>

858
00:37:46.441 --> 00:37:48.660
<v Speaker 7>it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was weird because it wasn't,</v>

859
00:37:48.661 --> 00:37:51.460
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was early enough in video games were,</v>

860
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:56.610
<v Speaker 7>wasn't like you could really make the </v>
<v Speaker 7>things do that much because also it was,</v>

861
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.460
<v Speaker 7>he was pretty animated,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there weren't a lot of options.</v>

862
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.030
<v Speaker 7>So like as long as you did the right </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing,</v>

863
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:04.920
<v Speaker 7>you move forward or you or,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or there'd be a scene of you failing.</v>

864
00:38:04.921 --> 00:38:06.450
<v Speaker 7>They have it on the IPAD,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I believe now,</v>

865
00:38:06.451 --> 00:38:09.560
<v Speaker 7>but that's my dream is to get in a </v>
<v Speaker 7>dragon's layer,</v>

866
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:14.570
<v Speaker 7>original dragon's lair arcade game.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And my friend actually just got one and </v>

867
00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:14.570
<v Speaker 7>I'm so jealous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's your dream.</v>

868
00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:15.750
<v Speaker 7>That was one of my like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

869
00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:18.090
<v Speaker 7>like you have dream things like gold </v>
<v Speaker 7>shorts.</v>

870
00:38:18.091 --> 00:38:21.450
<v Speaker 7>I went the gold short circuit board of </v>
<v Speaker 7>it today,</v>

871
00:38:21.451 --> 00:38:22.750
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So yeah,</v>

872
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:25.410
<v Speaker 7>let me give you also another reason to </v>
<v Speaker 7>be jealous.</v>

873
00:38:25.411 --> 00:38:29.730
<v Speaker 7>Here's the reason to not be jealous is </v>
<v Speaker 7>because when that thing breaks down,</v>

874
00:38:29.731 --> 00:38:33.150
<v Speaker 7>there's nobody that's gonna fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I already have a laser disc player at my</v>

875
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:34.530
<v Speaker 7>house,</v>
<v Speaker 7>brand new,</v>

876
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.110
<v Speaker 7>just waiting to replace it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>

877
00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:41.560
<v Speaker 7>You're good enough with that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 7>stuff that you can install.</v>

878
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.950
<v Speaker 7>The a couple of my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's what they do for a living and the</v>

879
00:38:44.951 --> 00:38:47.990
<v Speaker 7>arcade restore restoration.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Does that work on laser disk is.</v>

880
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:48.760
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a.</v>

881
00:38:48.761 --> 00:38:51.060
<v Speaker 7>it's a laser disc.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the game is a laser?</v>

882
00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Essentially.</v>

883
00:38:52.031 --> 00:38:53.260
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with just different chat.</v>

884
00:38:53.261 --> 00:38:58.261
<v Speaker 7>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you when you toggle the correct way or </v>

885
00:38:58.261 --> 00:38:58.840
<v Speaker 7>push the button the right way it goes </v>
<v Speaker 7>into a different chapter.</v>

886
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:03.870
<v Speaker 7>But honestly nowadays you can mod an </v>
<v Speaker 7>arcade games like I could hook up a </v>

887
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:05.530
<v Speaker 7>computer to it and have every single </v>
<v Speaker 7>arcade game ever,</v>

888
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:10.590
<v Speaker 7>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you don't even need the laser disk </v>

889
00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:10.590
<v Speaker 7>player anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are you using rom?</v>

890
00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:11.260
<v Speaker 7>How many options were there for </v>
<v Speaker 7>movement?</v>

891
00:39:11.261 --> 00:39:16.261
<v Speaker 7>That's what I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just remember being completely </v>

892
00:39:16.261 --> 00:39:16.261
<v Speaker 7>groundbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like Whoa,</v>

893
00:39:16.261 --> 00:39:17.210
<v Speaker 7>this is like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like an animal.</v>

894
00:39:17.211 --> 00:39:18.880
<v Speaker 7>There was a group,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's amazing.</v>

895
00:39:18.881 --> 00:39:22.210
<v Speaker 7>It was just joy stick in one button if I</v>
<v Speaker 7>recall.</v>

896
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:27.570
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you just kinda like are always kind of </v>

897
00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:27.570
<v Speaker 7>moving to the left or the right or,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or in the case.</v>

898
00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:29.530
<v Speaker 7>And it was hard case of like throwing </v>
<v Speaker 7>the sword into the Dragon.</v>

899
00:39:29.531 --> 00:39:34.531
<v Speaker 7>I think you had to just press the button</v>
<v Speaker 7>and and and motion in that direction at </v>

900
00:39:34.531 --> 00:39:35.800
<v Speaker 7>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Laser disc game show.</v>

901
00:39:35.801 --> 00:39:40.801
<v Speaker 7>The eighties were one of my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 7>things ever that he had that mach five </v>

902
00:39:40.801 --> 00:39:44.491
<v Speaker 7>or whatever it was called where it was </v>
<v Speaker 7>like you're a jet plane and it was like </v>

903
00:39:44.491 --> 00:39:47.730
<v Speaker 7>all real film of jets and it was really </v>
<v Speaker 7>cool because it was also using a laser </v>

904
00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:49.560
<v Speaker 7>disc player.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was like new and the.</v>

905
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:54.810
<v Speaker 7>They had like a space which was also </v>
<v Speaker 7>done by Don Bluth who did a dragon's </v>

906
00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:59.791
<v Speaker 7>layer and there was one game.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They started taking Japanese cartoon </v>

907
00:39:59.791 --> 00:40:03.061
<v Speaker 7>movies and making them a video games.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A Malibu Grand Prix had a.</v>

908
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:07.570
<v Speaker 7>It was a race track thing in the midwest</v>
<v Speaker 7>where they had a whole arcade division.</v>

909
00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:11.500
<v Speaker 7>So they took these animated movies and </v>
<v Speaker 7>one was called a space six,</v>

910
00:40:11.501 --> 00:40:16.501
<v Speaker 7>six six or it was like about a train and</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was the coolest video game because </v>

911
00:40:16.501 --> 00:40:20.281
<v Speaker 7>you were on top of a train and it was </v>
<v Speaker 7>like dragon's layer and it was like a </v>

912
00:40:20.281 --> 00:40:23.341
<v Speaker 7>spy movie was so cool,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that didn't ever really catch on.</v>

913
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:28.960
<v Speaker 7>Like it didn't really become,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was big briefly in the eighties,</v>

914
00:40:28.961 --> 00:40:31.000
<v Speaker 7>but it didn't become a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

915
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:35.590
<v Speaker 7>like there's Pac man and then everything</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's sort of vaguely remember that.</v>

916
00:40:35.591 --> 00:40:38.060
<v Speaker 7>I vaguely remember that in an arcade.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What year was this?</v>

917
00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:42.040
<v Speaker 7>This was about 85.</v>
<v Speaker 7>80 six I ever saw that.</v>

918
00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:45.190
<v Speaker 7>I only saw.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember space and feeling like it was</v>

919
00:40:45.191 --> 00:40:47.200
<v Speaker 7>already like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh well that's not dragon's layer.</v>

920
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.900
<v Speaker 7>That's just an attempt to be like dragon</v>
<v Speaker 7>slayer.</v>

921
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.260
<v Speaker 7>Home Computer Games must have just </v>
<v Speaker 7>crushed video arcades.</v>

922
00:40:53.261 --> 00:40:54.340
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It did.</v>

923
00:40:54.341 --> 00:40:59.170
<v Speaker 7>When the Nintendo finally came out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean not like a big video arcade.</v>

924
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.270
<v Speaker 7>You remember when we used to go to just </v>
<v Speaker 7>video arcades,</v>

925
00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:05.140
<v Speaker 7>you'd open the door and it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's always,</v>

926
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.560
<v Speaker 7>always with something else or in a weird</v>
<v Speaker 7>place like an airport or a scene.</v>

927
00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.340
<v Speaker 7>What are those?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What are those gaven buster type places.</v>

928
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:17.870
<v Speaker 7>They have a room of games,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they also have to have food and </v>

929
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:20.671
<v Speaker 7>drinks and pool tables and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a shuffleboard and like no place is just</v>

930
00:41:22.511 --> 00:41:27.511
<v Speaker 7>video games except for there's one joint</v>
<v Speaker 7>in Portland that's like a whole arcade </v>

931
00:41:28.451 --> 00:41:32.590
<v Speaker 7>that's just all old school shit </v>
<v Speaker 7>Portland.</v>

932
00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:33.860
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Of course.</v>

933
00:41:33.861 --> 00:41:35.180
<v Speaker 7>It's important that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's funny.</v>

934
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:38.090
<v Speaker 7>I told you about my friend that does the</v>
<v Speaker 7>restoration,</v>

935
00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:39.410
<v Speaker 7>spry and Pinzon,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Columbus,</v>

936
00:41:39.411 --> 00:41:39.920
<v Speaker 7>Ohio.</v>

937
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.030
<v Speaker 7>He uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>

938
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:44.540
<v Speaker 7>his whole basement,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he made a eighties arcade room.</v>

939
00:41:44.541 --> 00:41:48.280
<v Speaker 7>So you walked down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like you walk down into 1980 and so</v>

940
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:49.640
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's amazing.</v>

941
00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:52.160
<v Speaker 7>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So he decorated it like Wayne's world,</v>

942
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:57.250
<v Speaker 7>everything like those,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like little pink neon that's always at </v>

943
00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:57.250
<v Speaker 7>the top,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

944
00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:58.730
<v Speaker 7>from the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And as soon as Brian posts saying,</v>

945
00:41:58.731 --> 00:42:01.420
<v Speaker 7>made a nickel in show business,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he bought a.</v>

946
00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.070
<v Speaker 7>He and his buddy dave wrath bought a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

947
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.800
<v Speaker 7>a combination.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was half and half.</v>

948
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:08.230
<v Speaker 7>Ms Dot Pacman,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Galaga.</v>

949
00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.900
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would just spend hours over his house.</v>

950
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:14.900
<v Speaker 7>Gallagher geologists,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the shit.</v>

951
00:42:14.901 --> 00:42:16.760
<v Speaker 7>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm pretty good at Calico.</v>

952
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:22.030
<v Speaker 7>And then he also got a joust slash </v>
<v Speaker 7>robotron and I'm really good at robotron</v>

953
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.040
<v Speaker 7>was another one that I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

954
00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:26.630
<v Speaker 7>I just worked in an arcade so I just </v>
<v Speaker 7>played games all day.</v>

955
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.280
<v Speaker 7>Kids would come up to me and they'd be </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

956
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:31.100
<v Speaker 7>can I get some tokens that I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hang on a second kid,</v>

957
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.690
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I'd finished the round,</v>

958
00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.420
<v Speaker 7>then I'd throw him some tokens and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd go back to playing.</v>

959
00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:40.420
<v Speaker 7>Like it was the craziest job.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cocktail tables for the studio table.</v>

960
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:43.760
<v Speaker 7>Pacman,</v>
<v Speaker 7>joust games.</v>

961
00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:49.040
<v Speaker 7>They used to have those like while </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're waiting around like in a pizza </v>

962
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.731
<v Speaker 7>hut or sit down or sit down table </v>
<v Speaker 7>pinball was also kind of cool.</v>

963
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:58.300
<v Speaker 7>There's a place near me that the movie </v>
<v Speaker 7>theater has an arcade that was a little </v>

964
00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.720
<v Speaker 7>entry room.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We can go and play video games while </v>

965
00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.450
<v Speaker 7>you're waiting for your movie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just liked the look of it.</v>

966
00:43:02.451 --> 00:43:05.090
<v Speaker 7>I liked the style of arcade games.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I don't even play it much.</v>

967
00:43:05.091 --> 00:43:07.400
<v Speaker 7>Like I have a pac man at the studio and </v>
<v Speaker 7>I barely ever play.</v>

968
00:43:07.401 --> 00:43:10.170
<v Speaker 7>I just liked the lights of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I like just the look it,</v>

969
00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:14.950
<v Speaker 7>it's so Goddamn Lynard skynard poster.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's right.</v>

970
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:20.680
<v Speaker 7>It relaxes you and you're masturbating </v>
<v Speaker 7>or get turned on by these video game </v>

971
00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.600
<v Speaker 7>commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I get turned on by these video game </v>

972
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.501
<v Speaker 7>commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but not to the point where I'll go out </v>

973
00:43:29.501 --> 00:43:29.501
<v Speaker 7>and get it out.</v>

974
00:43:29.501 --> 00:43:29.501
<v Speaker 7>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I won't,</v>

975
00:43:29.501 --> 00:43:30.260
<v Speaker 7>I won't allow myself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just know that I will,</v>

976
00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:32.480
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>any new video game,</v>

977
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.820
<v Speaker 7>I sort of kicked it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

978
00:43:34.821 --> 00:43:36.520
<v Speaker 7>I just stopped doing it altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

979
00:43:36.521 --> 00:43:37.620
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>after uh,</v>

980
00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:39.990
<v Speaker 7>I'd say after Mario Kart.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

981
00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:45.140
<v Speaker 7>I used to play that day and night and </v>
<v Speaker 7>then after a while you're just like,</v>

982
00:43:45.141 --> 00:43:47.090
<v Speaker 7>what is getting great at this gonna do </v>
<v Speaker 7>for me.</v>

983
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:49.930
<v Speaker 7>It's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's the truth.</v>

984
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:55.450
<v Speaker 7>You're getting tricked,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're getting tricked into doing </v>

985
00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:55.450
<v Speaker 7>something absolutely stupid with your </v>
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>

986
00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.500
<v Speaker 7>And it hijacks your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your whole idea,</v>

987
00:43:57.501 --> 00:43:58.850
<v Speaker 7>your reward system,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

988
00:43:58.851 --> 00:44:02.480
<v Speaker 7>you're succeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're focused,</v>

989
00:44:02.481 --> 00:44:07.481
<v Speaker 7>you're in on it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but really you're not even in the real </v>

990
00:44:07.481 --> 00:44:07.481
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're in this getting all these signals</v>

991
00:44:07.481 --> 00:44:08.850
<v Speaker 7>from this fake world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

992
00:44:08.851 --> 00:44:10.930
<v Speaker 7>But it's like watching a movie to me </v>
<v Speaker 7>nowadays,</v>

993
00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:11.650
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

994
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:15.530
<v Speaker 7>it's like watching a movie to me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want to escape reality,</v>

995
00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:17.540
<v Speaker 7>but I want to have more control of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>movie united.</v>

996
00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:21.800
<v Speaker 7>So that's kind of why I do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't watch as many movies anymore.</v>

997
00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:24.320
<v Speaker 7>My time when you have interactive video </v>
<v Speaker 7>games,</v>

998
00:44:24.321 --> 00:44:29.321
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of thinking involved,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially if you're playing like if </v>

999
00:44:29.321 --> 00:44:30.590
<v Speaker 7>you're playing counter strike or </v>
<v Speaker 7>something like that or playing quake or,</v>

1000
00:44:30.591 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 7>and any John Madden,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you</v>

1001
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.470
<v Speaker 1>got to know about all the players and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1002
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of thinking going on.</v>

1003
00:44:36.121 --> 00:44:41.121
<v Speaker 1>Like your synapses are firing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know whether or not you choose to </v>

1004
00:44:41.121 --> 00:44:41.121
<v Speaker 1>think</v>

1005
00:44:41.121 --> 00:44:41.650
<v Speaker 2>they're firing on something useful or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1006
00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:42.390
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1007
00:44:42.391 --> 00:44:43.960
<v Speaker 2>that's really sort of an arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision.</v>

1008
00:44:43.961 --> 00:44:48.961
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't say that this person </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't actually training their mind </v>

1009
00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:48.961
<v Speaker 2>through intensive video games</v>

1010
00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:50.590
<v Speaker 1>because you're doing intense video </v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

1011
00:44:50.591 --> 00:44:52.060
<v Speaker 1>You're multitasking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking,</v>

1012
00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:54.250
<v Speaker 1>your synapses are firing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're moving your fingers.</v>

1013
00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:59.460
<v Speaker 1>You have to first person shooters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be in direct coordination </v>

1014
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:03.331
<v Speaker 1>with your left hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which movies your keys and your right </v>

1015
00:45:03.331 --> 00:45:03.331
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which controls the mouse.</v>

1016
00:45:03.331 --> 00:45:04.450
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of shit going on.</v>

1017
00:45:04.451 --> 00:45:06.940
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell me that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not exercise for the mind.</v>

1018
00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I played a lot of golden eye too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that I think,</v>

1019
00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:13.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rereleased what's gold?</v>

1020
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.840
<v Speaker 1>And it was the first James Bond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the pretty cool.</v>

1021
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Was it good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll run around different weapons type </v>

1022
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:22.270
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they'd have,</v>

1023
00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:24.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could play for people at a time.</v>

1024
00:45:24.041 --> 00:45:29.041
<v Speaker 1>So me and two other people just sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>there for hours chasing each other </v>

1025
00:45:29.041 --> 00:45:29.140
<v Speaker 1>around trying to shoot each other.</v>

1026
00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:31.970
<v Speaker 2>So stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1027
00:45:31.971 --> 00:45:34.530
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1028
00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:38.510
<v Speaker 2>the entire writing staff was addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>quake and they had a land set up,</v>

1029
00:45:38.511 --> 00:45:42.730
<v Speaker 2>a local area network setup in the office</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they had like six,</v>

1030
00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:47.780
<v Speaker 2>seven computers all linked up together </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would have these mad quake </v>

1031
00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.390
<v Speaker 2>tournament's and was courageous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really fucking fun.</v>

1032
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:53.660
<v Speaker 2>It was unfortunately though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>highly,</v>

1033
00:45:53.661 --> 00:45:55.450
<v Speaker 2>hugely addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

1034
00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.780
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I would get really stuck playing know </v>

1036
00:46:01.781 --> 00:46:01.781

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know you knew him or what,</v>

1071
00:47:26.471 --> 00:47:29.330
<v Speaker 1>but like it just went to his house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we met?</v>

1072
00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:31.870
<v Speaker 3>We met at a pool hall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the pool hall?</v>

1073
00:47:31.871 --> 00:47:33.310
<v Speaker 3>Because that's another thing that seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be dying.</v>

1074
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:38.670
<v Speaker 3>It's not hard to find pool halls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was the house of billiards in </v>

1075
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:38.670
<v Speaker 3>Sherman Oaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:39.250
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hard to find good places.</v>

1077
00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Vegas has the most good places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegas still has 24 hour pool halls,</v>

1078
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:48.570
<v Speaker 3>which is an anomaly outside of Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It used to be in New York you could get </v>

1079
00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:49.630
<v Speaker 3>24 hour pool halls a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was Chelsea,</v>

1080
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:54.660
<v Speaker 3>Chelsea billiards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was a bunch of other smaller </v>

1081
00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:54.660
<v Speaker 3>places that were 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many of them are left,</v>

1082
00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.530
<v Speaker 3>but Chelsea is gone and a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>big ones are gone.</v>

1083
00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:59.410
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At 24 hour place to play a sport.</v>

1084
00:47:59.411 --> 00:48:01.660
<v Speaker 3>There's not many of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not like anything else.</v>

1085
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:05.020
<v Speaker 3>The name pool really is all about </v>
<v Speaker 3>gambling.</v>

1086
00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:10.170
<v Speaker 3>It's really pocket billiards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called pool because everybody's </v>

1087
00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:10.790
<v Speaker 3>pooling their money together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bending.</v>

1088
00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:15.610
<v Speaker 3>The Fun in pool is all about money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about gambling and so you would</v>

1089
00:48:15.611 --> 00:48:18.970
<v Speaker 3>go to these places and the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were open 24 hours a day because no</v>

1090
00:48:18.971 --> 00:48:21.700
<v Speaker 3>one ever wanted to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would just play.</v>

1091
00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.910
<v Speaker 3>You get down and try to get back up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys would sleep under the tables.</v>

1092
00:48:26.911 --> 00:48:28.810
<v Speaker 3>It was so common that guys would stay </v>
<v Speaker 3>there for two,</v>

1093
00:48:28.811 --> 00:48:29.960
<v Speaker 3>three days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1094
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:34.980
<v Speaker 3>I would go and do gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd come back and the same guys will be </v>

1095
00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:35.420
<v Speaker 3>there from the night before and the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes.</v>

1096
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.170
<v Speaker 3>Almost like a job for a lot of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1097
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.990
<v Speaker 3>and they would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would be gambling like crazy,</v>

1098
00:48:40.991 --> 00:48:43.660
<v Speaker 3>but it was always fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was always exciting.</v>

1099
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:44.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1100
00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:47.230
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world of gambling and pool and,</v>

1101
00:48:47.231 --> 00:48:48.080
<v Speaker 3>and that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1102
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:49.900
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're in an auction room,</v>

1103
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.640
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1104
00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.260
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very addictive,</v>

1105
00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:54.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's again,</v>

1106
00:48:54.371 --> 00:48:55.930
<v Speaker 3>it's just like the video game thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1107
00:48:55.931 --> 00:48:58.470
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing by getting really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good at putting balls in holes?</v>

1108
00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:01.350
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gambling illegally and getting,</v>

1109
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:06.660
<v Speaker 3>getting in scrapes with guys because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't for the most dudes,</v>

1110
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:09.160
<v Speaker 3>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if everybody knew everybody.</v>

1111
00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:12.040
<v Speaker 3>There was very few problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was always stories.</v>

1112
00:49:12.041 --> 00:49:17.041
<v Speaker 3>If you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy wanted his money back and he </v>

1113
00:49:17.041 --> 00:49:17.041
<v Speaker 3>came at this guy with a fucking golf </v>
<v Speaker 3>club and you know,</v>

1114
00:49:17.041 --> 00:49:22.000
<v Speaker 3>there was always those stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a few scuffles over the years of </v>

1115
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.640
<v Speaker 3>hanging out and pool halls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for the most part when people paid,</v>

1116
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:25.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1117
00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.830
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they wanted to keep gambling,</v>

1118
00:49:26.831 --> 00:49:29.620
<v Speaker 3>they had to pay when they lost because </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody had.</v>

1119
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:31.330
<v Speaker 3>There was a gambler's ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

1120
00:49:31.331 --> 00:49:35.320
<v Speaker 3>if you cause trouble when you lost and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're only happy when you won,</v>

1121
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.430
<v Speaker 3>nobody would gamble with you.</v>

1122
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:41.460
<v Speaker 3>People didn't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were just naturally became guys </v>

1123
00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.671
<v Speaker 3>who had good reputations and guys who </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't and if he didn't know the guy </v>

1124
00:49:44.671 --> 00:49:47.491
<v Speaker 3>don't play him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it sort of Tom Cruise and Paul </v>

1125
00:49:47.491 --> 00:49:48.700
<v Speaker 3>Newman's showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the big.</v>

1126
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.280
<v Speaker 3>That's when people realize how fun it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

1127
00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:52.870
<v Speaker 3>But it's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's getting,</v>

1128
00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:57.900
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of getting lost in our </v>

1129
00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:57.900
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we were playing last night,</v>

1130
00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:01.540
<v Speaker 3>there was a girl a at a table next to us</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was pretty good.</v>

1131
00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:06.680
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she could play pretty good and she was </v>

1132
00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.761
<v Speaker 3>with her boyfriend who couldn't fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>play at all and she was humiliating him </v>

1133
00:50:08.761 --> 00:50:13.710
<v Speaker 3>and he was trying getting super upset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like she didn't even try to </v>

1134
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:15.970
<v Speaker 3>help him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His technique was fucking horrible.</v>

1135
00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:20.971
<v Speaker 3>His elbows up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was putting all kinds of extra spin </v>

1136
00:50:20.971 --> 00:50:21.550
<v Speaker 3>on the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't make a ball to save his life.</v>

1137
00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:26.730
<v Speaker 3>And the girl was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just laughing at him and jumping up and </v>

1138
00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:26.730
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time she won.</v>

1139
00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:28.340
<v Speaker 3>And you could see him getting fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>pissed.</v>

1140
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Getting actually pissed off that she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like bragging because she was winning </v>

1141
00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.220
<v Speaker 2>this game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you see them,</v>

1142
00:50:34.221 --> 00:50:36.410
<v Speaker 2>like almost want to hit her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1143
00:50:36.411 --> 00:50:41.411
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some deep seated shit in this </v>

1144
00:50:41.411 --> 00:50:41.411
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Augie.</v>

1145
00:50:41.411 --> 00:50:43.400
<v Speaker 2>All competition between dudes and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend.</v>

1146
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Any kind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It brings out some really weird shit,</v>

1147
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:52.550
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to win against a woman no matter</v>

1148
00:50:52.551 --> 00:50:56.030
<v Speaker 2>how nice to women you are and how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>you respect them.</v>

1149
00:50:56.110 --> 00:51:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Still this weird thing kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just hardwired.</v>

1150
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was dating.</v>

1151
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:07.030
<v Speaker 2>This is how I got into pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was dating this chick and she was a </v>

1152
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:10.241
<v Speaker 2>little older than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she used to like to tell them what </v>

1153
00:51:10.241 --> 00:51:10.241
<v Speaker 2>to do and I didn't really like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like to fuck her.</v>

1154
00:51:10.241 --> 00:51:12.370
<v Speaker 2>So I stuck around for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1155
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.200
<v Speaker 2>we played.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the things she tells you</v>

1156
00:51:15.201 --> 00:51:15.620
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

1157
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we played pool once and uh,</v>

1158
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:20.220
<v Speaker 2>she beat me playing pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was not,</v>

1159
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:22.580
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wouldn't say she was pretty good,</v>

1160
00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:24.530
<v Speaker 2>but she beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I said,</v>

1161
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found something.</v>

1162
00:51:26.001 --> 00:51:27.440
<v Speaker 2>She's good at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1163
00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:28.610
<v Speaker 2>like she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

1164
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.750
<v Speaker 2>she's better at meeting this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1165
00:51:29.751 --> 00:51:31.220
<v Speaker 2>this is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to fix this.</v>

1166
00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:34.610
<v Speaker 2>I have to fix this at once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went to the pool hall and learn how</v>

1167
00:51:34.611 --> 00:51:38.630
<v Speaker 2>to play pool and we started practicing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Teacher went and I,</v>

1168
00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:40.710
<v Speaker 2>I got a book on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1169
00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my own cue.</v>

1170
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:46.540
<v Speaker 2>I figured out how to play pool and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we played again and I killed her.</v>

1171
00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get it.</v>

1172
00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:54.041
<v Speaker 2>I totally practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally learn how to pull play pool and </v>

1173
00:51:54.041 --> 00:51:57.701
<v Speaker 2>then winter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wasn't good by any stretch of </v>

1174
00:51:57.701 --> 00:52:00.461
<v Speaker 2>the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least I knew how to play pool </v>

1175
00:52:00.461 --> 00:52:00.461
<v Speaker 2>like I was.</v>

1176
00:52:00.461 --> 00:52:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I was definitely way better than it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time we played and then I won.</v>

1177
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000
<v Speaker 2>So I like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a problem that I couldn't let her </v>

1178
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.410
<v Speaker 2>have beaten me in something and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>how I got addicted to playing pool.</v>

1179
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm imagining you being like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>zookeeper character as you're telling </v>

1180
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:15.700
<v Speaker 2>that story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was totally like that guy.</v>

1181
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Well that was the dark days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the actual fighting days.</v>

1182
00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:19.790
<v Speaker 2>The dark days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1183
00:52:19.791 --> 00:52:22.350
<v Speaker 2>I was way crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1184
00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.230
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of an example of something</v>
<v Speaker 2>I taught myself to be better at,</v>

1185
00:52:25.231 --> 00:52:26.480
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to beat my girlfriend,</v>

1186
00:52:26.481 --> 00:52:28.970
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could not let her.</v>

1187
00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:31.370
<v Speaker 2>She was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was older than me and she was smart.</v>

1188
00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:34.010
<v Speaker 2>There was no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was a very educated person to,</v>

1189
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:37.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was a musician.</v>

1190
00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:38.430
<v Speaker 2>She was in a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot,</v>

1191
00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:39.620
<v Speaker 2>a lot of shit going on.</v>

1192
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:42.000
<v Speaker 2>She ever wrote a song about you when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys were doing.</v>

1193
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:44.830
<v Speaker 2>That'd be cool if there was a song out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1194
00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:50.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a nice person,</v>

1195
00:52:51.381 --> 00:52:53.900
<v Speaker 2>very nice person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but couldn't sort of.</v>

1196
00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:54.710
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1197
00:52:55.400 --> 00:53:00.400
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to stay in touch with </v>

1198
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:00.400
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1199
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:00.400
<v Speaker 2>when you used to date them and all down </v>
<v Speaker 2>they date other people.</v>

1200
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.860
<v Speaker 2>They don't want some dude fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling and texting and emailing.</v>

1201
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:05.030
<v Speaker 2>It's not great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not right.</v>

1202
00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:08.420
<v Speaker 2>You know which from the best and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't confuse everybody.</v>

1203
00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.600
<v Speaker 2>You can confuse the shit out of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1204
00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:14.020
<v Speaker 2>don't you think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1205
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:19.030
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you know you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight with your husband and you know </v>

1206
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:21.761
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're having an email talks with your </v>

1207
00:53:21.761 --> 00:53:21.761
<v Speaker 2>ex boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden you start thinking,</v>

1208
00:53:21.761 --> 00:53:25.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this guy and I could give it one </v>

1209
00:53:25.631 --> 00:53:25.631
<v Speaker 2>more shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's why it,</v>

1210
00:53:25.631 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 2>it can conflict,</v>

1211
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:26.870
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if it's an</v>

1212
00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:32.180
<v Speaker 4>open forum only then that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a facebook wall posts and stuff </v>

1213
00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:32.180
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1214
00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:32.820
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how have you been?</v>

1215
00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:34.590
<v Speaker 4>And we should hang out sometime or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

1216
00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:39.850
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe you could do some gamesmanship </v>
<v Speaker 4>or somebody wants something and then the</v>

1217
00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:45.860
<v Speaker 4>trouble is the other people in your life</v>
<v Speaker 4>start questioning what's going on and it</v>

1218
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:46.350
<v Speaker 4>sucks.</v>

1219
00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:47.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sucks.</v>

1220
00:53:47.171 --> 00:53:48.490
<v Speaker 3>It's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1221
00:53:48.491 --> 00:53:50.050
<v Speaker 3>We should be able to just fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

1222
00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:52.390
<v Speaker 3>That's really ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one can handle that.</v>

1223
00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:56.940
<v Speaker 3>Red Bands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only person that could handle that.</v>

1224
00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:02.040
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine if the ego actually </v>

1225
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:02.800
<v Speaker 3>gets completely cured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can't have art,</v>

1226
00:54:02.801 --> 00:54:07.801
<v Speaker 3>then that'd be senior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to have artists like </v>

1227
00:54:07.801 --> 00:54:10.360
<v Speaker 3>the best jokes were to get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Art is like the struggle,</v>

1228
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000
<v Speaker 3>the best painter artist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the struggle between the ego and </v>

1229
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.520
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the desire to produce something </v>

1230
00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:21.550
<v Speaker 3>fantastic to please others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1231
00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:23.760
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't control the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1232
00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:25.600
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't really produce aren't.</v>

1233
00:54:25.601 --> 00:54:28.990
<v Speaker 3>But the fight with the ego is what fuels</v>
<v Speaker 3>the art sometimes.</v>

1234
00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:31.120
<v Speaker 3>So if we had no ego,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd have no art,</v>

1235
00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:36.180
<v Speaker 3>no art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people would just fuck like </v>

1236
00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.911
<v Speaker 3>randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody would just be able to fuck </v>

1237
00:54:38.911 --> 00:54:38.911
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't worry about it.</v>

1238
00:54:38.911 --> 00:54:39.900
<v Speaker 4>It takes nerve to be an artist because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're basically saying,</v>

1239
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:45.080
<v Speaker 4>you know that I can do this thing so </v>
<v Speaker 4>well that people are going to want it.</v>

1240
00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.560
<v Speaker 4>It's very arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1241
00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:49.260
<v Speaker 4>super arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's also,</v>

1242
00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it starts out like you're,</v>

1243
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just like,</v>

1244
00:54:53.971 --> 00:54:58.410
<v Speaker 4>I get people asking me all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you become a standup comic?</v>

1245
00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.480
<v Speaker 4>And I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do it.</v>

1246
00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:02.310
<v Speaker 4>That's how you become one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just do it.</v>

1247
00:55:02.311 --> 00:55:03.480
<v Speaker 4>And then they're always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1248
00:55:03.481 --> 00:55:08.481
<v Speaker 4>but do you have any advice?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I really like just lots of little </v>

1249
00:55:08.481 --> 00:55:11.300
<v Speaker 4>tiny pieces of advice you can give if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to sit with a person and talked</v>

1250
00:55:11.301 --> 00:55:15.150
<v Speaker 4>to them for two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But big advice is just do it.</v>

1251
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:18.260
<v Speaker 3>Never underestimate the power of </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually fucking doing something.</v>

1252
00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:20.380
<v Speaker 3>And also I'll also not the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1253
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:22.220
<v Speaker 3>the fact that they're questioning it at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

1254
00:55:22.221 --> 00:55:27.221
<v Speaker 3>the fact that they're looking to someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>else for help to get started makes you </v>

1255
00:55:27.221 --> 00:55:28.370
<v Speaker 3>think that they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are they ever going to make it?</v>

1256
00:55:28.371 --> 00:55:30.890
<v Speaker 3>Because they don't want it badly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to just do it.</v>

1257
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:32.270
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never asked anybody,</v>

1258
00:55:32.271 --> 00:55:37.271
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what you have to do to go on </v>

1259
00:55:37.271 --> 00:55:37.271
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you have to do against days?</v>

1260
00:55:37.271 --> 00:55:37.280
<v Speaker 3>That was my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my initial question,</v>

1261
00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:40.280
<v Speaker 3>but once I got in and started doing open</v>
<v Speaker 3>mics,</v>

1262
00:55:40.281 --> 00:55:41.150
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1263
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:41.740
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1264
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.210
<v Speaker 3>you figure it out by doing it and trial </v>
<v Speaker 3>and error.</v>

1265
00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.020
<v Speaker 3>No one's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's good.</v>

1266
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:49.910
<v Speaker 3>The no one that you know who thinks </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're funny.</v>

1267
00:55:49.911 --> 00:55:52.370
<v Speaker 3>You can go on stage and kill in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a room full of strangers.</v>

1268
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:55.460
<v Speaker 3>You might laugh if you think they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>your buddy and they're up there.</v>

1269
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:56.390
<v Speaker 3>Yuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yuck it up,</v>

1270
00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:57.380
<v Speaker 3>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1271
00:55:57.381 --> 00:56:02.381
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird fucking way to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 3>with people and it really is not all </v>

1272
00:56:02.721 --> 00:56:07.721
<v Speaker 3>that it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very tricky sort of a craft that </v>

1273
00:56:07.721 --> 00:56:08.660
<v Speaker 3>you have to learn and develop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can do it.</v>

1274
00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nobody's good in the beginning.</v>

1275
00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:13.310
<v Speaker 3>Nobody is good in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1276
00:56:13.311 --> 00:56:14.090
<v Speaker 3>Or you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1277
00:56:14.091 --> 00:56:16.240
<v Speaker 3>you get your labs here and there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's encouraged.</v>

1278
00:56:16.241 --> 00:56:17.930
<v Speaker 3>You get a little chuckle here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1279
00:56:17.931 --> 00:56:19.910
<v Speaker 3>you feel like you're onto something but </v>
<v Speaker 3>you suck.</v>

1280
00:56:19.911 --> 00:56:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all sucked.</v>

1281
00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 3>Everybody does not have your first</v>

1282
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:29.100
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that usually the best to within the </v>

1283
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.980
<v Speaker 2>next 10 times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people get an extra charisma </v>

1284
00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:31.980
<v Speaker 2>bump to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1285
00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:35.970
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I bet you the first set of like </v>

1286
00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Bill Hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Murphy.</v>

1287
00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1288
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:39.100
<v Speaker 2>Spade started really early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rock started really early,</v>

1289
00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:41.150
<v Speaker 2>like those guys were probably were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1290
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:43.560
<v Speaker 2>very decent their first time out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1291
00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:47.530
<v Speaker 2>just because you know that it's that </v>
<v Speaker 2>charismatic personality.</v>

1292
00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about he has,</v>

1293
00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.700
<v Speaker 2>who is one of my favorite comedians of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>

1294
00:56:51.701 --> 00:56:56.701
<v Speaker 2>Joey Joey is in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's at a just sheer laugh out loud,</v>

1295
00:56:56.981 --> 00:56:59.800
<v Speaker 2>fall down moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's provided me with the most,</v>

1296
00:56:59.801 --> 00:57:04.801
<v Speaker 2>if any human being ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Joey was not that good when I met </v>

1297
00:57:04.801 --> 00:57:05.140
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was not that good on stage.</v>

1298
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:07.570
<v Speaker 2>He just couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a real weird thing.</v>

1299
00:57:07.571 --> 00:57:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was.</v>

1300
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:13.500
<v Speaker 2>He's just a hilarious dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's hilarious talking about </v>

1301
00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:16.231
<v Speaker 2>anything but he maybe he couldn't focus </v>
<v Speaker 2>it into setup punchline kind of maybe.</v>

1302
00:57:17.141 --> 00:57:22.141
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was or bins turned </v>
<v Speaker 2>a fucking corner man and I don't </v>

1303
00:57:22.141 --> 00:57:23.040
<v Speaker 2>remember when it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our,</v>

1304
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.940
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was actually,</v>

1305
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:27.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1306
00:57:27.311 --> 00:57:29.860
<v Speaker 2>maybe maybe three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four years in.</v>

1307
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

1308
00:57:31.151 --> 00:57:36.151
<v Speaker 2>four years in o and m,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he turned this fucking corner and just </v>

1309
00:57:36.151 --> 00:57:38.560
<v Speaker 2>started destroying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wavy just became more himself.</v>

1310
00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1311
00:57:39.191 --> 00:57:40.510
<v Speaker 2>he definitely did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1312
00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.810
<v Speaker 2>he just learned to be relaxed on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just eat,</v>

1313
00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:48.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked him what happened and he was </v>

1314
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:48.840
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just stopped giving a fuck.</v>

1315
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1316
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:48.840
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped giving a fuck.</v>

1317
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not trying too many things,</v>

1318
00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:52.870
<v Speaker 2>too many people telling them what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

1319
00:57:52.871 --> 00:57:54.340
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it my way.</v>

1320
00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:55.690
<v Speaker 2>And when he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

1321
00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.330
<v Speaker 2>he was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when he was trying to make everybody</v>

1322
00:57:58.331 --> 00:57:59.590
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just couldn't.</v>

1323
00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:02.950
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't really be himself,</v>

1324
00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:04.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>himself as the,</v>

1325
00:58:04.421 --> 00:58:09.421
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck guy that tells the </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny stories in the back of the comedy </v>

1326
00:58:09.421 --> 00:58:10.120
<v Speaker 2>store and that's the guy that we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew and loved.</v>

1327
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.120
<v Speaker 2>But then on stage he figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it and that was,</v>

1328
00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:13.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1329
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:17.930
<v Speaker 2>that's the most dramatic at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my life of seeing someone go from not</v>

1330
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:20.860
<v Speaker 2>being good to being really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Is the most dramatic.</v>

1331
00:58:21.090 --> 00:58:21.700
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>

1332
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.730
<v Speaker 4>I got my most dramatic one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was Doug Stanhope?</v>

1333
00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:27.490
<v Speaker 4>Doug Stanhope wasn't good in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning.</v>

1334
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:28.120
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1335
00:58:28.121 --> 00:58:33.121
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how raw he was when I saw </v>

1336
00:58:33.121 --> 00:58:33.121
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

1337
00:58:33.121 --> 00:58:34.000
<v Speaker 4>what year was this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>

1338
00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:36.670
<v Speaker 4>a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a,</v>

1339
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.120
<v Speaker 4>it was back when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1340
00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:43.190
<v Speaker 4>Steve Sherpa was still physically there </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the Riviera comedy club and it was </v>

1341
00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:46.210
<v Speaker 4>maybe even still an Improv at that </v>
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

1342
00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:51.360
<v Speaker 4>And I was one of two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always wanted to feature acts with </v>

1343
00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.871
<v Speaker 4>this other guy named Tom Martin knew now</v>
<v Speaker 4>he writes on simpsons and stuff and the </v>

1344
00:58:54.871 --> 00:58:58.450
<v Speaker 4>headliner was hugh fink and Doug </v>
<v Speaker 4>Stanhope was the host,</v>

1345
00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:03.960
<v Speaker 4>the Mc for like one of those crazy weeks</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you do two shows a night for seven</v>

1346
00:59:04.001 --> 00:59:09.001
<v Speaker 4>nights and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and crowds were starting to get smaller </v>

1347
00:59:09.001 --> 00:59:09.100
<v Speaker 4>than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1348
00:59:09.101 --> 00:59:14.101
<v Speaker 4>like the kind of the vegas comedy boom </v>
<v Speaker 4>was starting to fade a little bit and </v>

1349
00:59:14.101 --> 00:59:15.520
<v Speaker 4>Sherpa would just yell at him every </v>
<v Speaker 4>night,</v>

1350
00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:20.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was like that weeks punching bag and </v>

1351
00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:21.530
<v Speaker 4>what was just yelling at him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he was,</v>

1352
00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.850
<v Speaker 4>it was just Doug Stanhope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1353
00:59:22.851 --> 00:59:23.400
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1354
00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:24.390
<v Speaker 4>being laid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bringing,</v>

1355
00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.630
<v Speaker 4>bringing a girl into the showroom </v>
<v Speaker 4>without asking ahead of time and like,</v>

1356
00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:29.100
<v Speaker 4>like triple just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1357
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:32.050
<v Speaker 4>it happened to me a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just sort of picks one person to sort</v>

1358
00:59:32.051 --> 00:59:37.051
<v Speaker 4>of pick on to kind of establish to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>group that you can't get away with </v>

1359
00:59:37.051 --> 00:59:37.051
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

1360
00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:41.360
<v Speaker 4>But Doug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a super,</v>

1361
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:42.650
<v Speaker 4>super good kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1362
00:59:42.651 --> 00:59:47.651
<v Speaker 4>nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a few years older than him and </v>

1363
00:59:47.651 --> 00:59:47.651
<v Speaker 4>thought I really had it under control </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the three of us,</v>

1364
00:59:47.651 --> 00:59:49.610
<v Speaker 4>we just all that we're working with </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

1365
00:59:49.611 --> 00:59:50.780
<v Speaker 4>we just all sort of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1366
00:59:50.781 --> 00:59:55.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll see what happens with him because </v>

1367
00:59:55.781 --> 00:59:55.781
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his act was just like,</v>

1368
00:59:55.781 --> 00:59:56.240
<v Speaker 4>he was just like anybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1369
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:59.270
<v Speaker 4>just somebody trying to do is stand back</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not.</v>

1370
00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:02.000
<v Speaker 4>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stan hope really turned a corner when he</v>

1371
01:00:02.001 --> 01:00:05.270
<v Speaker 4>just started talking about his own </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences instead of trying to say,</v>

1372
01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.360
<v Speaker 4>do you ever notice that he's not an </v>
<v Speaker 4>observational comic?</v>

1373
01:00:08.361 --> 01:00:13.361
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's observations within what he's </v>

1374
01:00:13.361 --> 01:00:15.551
<v Speaker 4>talking about because these stories are </v>
<v Speaker 4>so interesting and he saw such a funny </v>

1375
01:00:15.551 --> 01:00:15.551
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

1376
01:00:15.551 --> 01:00:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're young it's like,</v>

1377
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:19.240
<v Speaker 3>what do you have to really talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Said that.</v>

1378
01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:24.440
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember he had this one bit where he </v>

1379
01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:24.440
<v Speaker 4>would talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would talk about,</v>

1380
01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:28.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would describe how nasty a egg roll </v>

1381
01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:33.891
<v Speaker 4>is and how much he doesn't like egg </v>
<v Speaker 4>rolls and it's like as an audience </v>

1382
01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:33.891
<v Speaker 4>member,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1383
01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:38.960
<v Speaker 4>maybe 50,</v>
<v Speaker 4>70 percent of the audience loves </v>

1384
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:39.750
<v Speaker 4>eggrolls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then it was just kind of like,</v>

1385
01:00:39.751 --> 01:00:40.860
<v Speaker 4>you just kind of sit there going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1386
01:00:40.861 --> 01:00:41.520
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1387
01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:42.820
<v Speaker 4>he's got to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1388
01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:47.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's either got to have more of a </v>

1389
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.521
<v Speaker 4>personal take on why they're bad to </v>
<v Speaker 4>convince us or he's got to drop that </v>

1390
01:00:49.801 --> 01:00:50.700
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1391
01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.210
<v Speaker 4>egg rolls are awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're delicious.</v>

1392
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:53.160

<v Speaker 4>they're filled with mulch.</v>

1394
01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:58.260

<v Speaker 4>punch slides was just the word mulch.</v>

1442
01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:58.680
<v Speaker 3>that were kicked out of mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>institutions,</v>

<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

1592
01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.061
<v Speaker 3>have a few of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was really young when I was before I </v>

1593
01:08:55.061 --> 01:08:57.701
<v Speaker 3>was sick so I barely remember it like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you said it and it makes me like have </v>

1594
01:08:57.701 --> 01:09:00.770
<v Speaker 3>little flashes that might not even be </v>
<v Speaker 3>real know they were put in there,</v>

1595
01:09:00.790 --> 01:09:03.890
<v Speaker 3>but I talk about this on stage which is </v>
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>

1596
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:08.890
<v Speaker 3>I remember one vivid moment when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>young because everybody was mad at me </v>

1597
01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:13.180
<v Speaker 3>because I hit my cousin with a bag of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cookies and everybody was mad because </v>

1598
01:09:13.371 --> 01:09:15.980
<v Speaker 3>the cookies went flying and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cookie of looking at the cookies and</v>

1599
01:09:15.981 --> 01:09:20.981
<v Speaker 3>the dirt and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucked up but I was like four and </v>

1600
01:09:20.981 --> 01:09:21.950
<v Speaker 3>people were angry at me and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1601
01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:27.220
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing that they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there could be even a semi vivid </v>

1602
01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:27.350
<v Speaker 3>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1603
01:09:27.351 --> 01:09:29.540
<v Speaker 3>when you say like I have a vivid memory </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>

1604
01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:32.450
<v Speaker 3>what does really mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much are you extrapolating?</v>

1605
01:09:32.451 --> 01:09:34.910
<v Speaker 3>How much are you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much are you exaggerating?</v>

1606
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:40.030
<v Speaker 3>How vivid is it real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was big enough in the first place to </v>

1607
01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:42.740
<v Speaker 3>some form of it his and sometimes like </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's the thing that's crazy to</v>

1608
01:09:42.741 --> 01:09:47.741
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like whenever somebody remembers a </v>

1609
01:09:47.741 --> 01:09:49.340
<v Speaker 3>ton of stuff from when they were little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always kind of baffled by that.</v>

1610
01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:54.340
<v Speaker 3>I think it's almost like they're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of taking what they kind of </v>

1611
01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:55.520
<v Speaker 3>remember and then just going ahead and </v>
<v Speaker 3>filling out the story.</v>

1612
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that is a lot of what happens.</v>

1613
01:09:58.041 --> 01:10:03.041
<v Speaker 3>I don't think our memories and I fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>good and I think they don't understand </v>

1614
01:10:03.041 --> 01:10:04.460
<v Speaker 3>really where memory is stored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1615
01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:09.461
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the issue with memory and the brain is </v>

1616
01:10:09.461 --> 01:10:12.461
<v Speaker 3>that they believed that every seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>years virtually every cell in the body </v>

1617
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:16.330
<v Speaker 3>has regenerated and reborn in new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a new version,</v>

1618
01:10:16.331 --> 01:10:21.331
<v Speaker 3>like in seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every cell is different than the seven </v>

1619
01:10:21.331 --> 01:10:24.260
<v Speaker 3>years before except the neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they don't know if that memory is</v>

1620
01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:29.261
<v Speaker 3>stored somehow in the neurons or if it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just sort of handed down like files.</v>

1621
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:32.840
<v Speaker 3>Like every seven years you got a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration comes in and goes,</v>

1622
01:10:32.841 --> 01:10:34.010
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the past,</v>

1623
01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:35.600
<v Speaker 3>this is the uncle that fuck them.</v>

1624
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:38.180
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing that happened in </v>
<v Speaker 3>second grade.</v>

1625
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:40.570
<v Speaker 3>This is the car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this is,</v>

1626
01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:41.690
<v Speaker 3>you've got to remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you got it,</v>

1627
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:46.750
<v Speaker 3>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they take it and then seven </v>

1628
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:49.121
<v Speaker 3>years later out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have pockets of things you don't </v>

1629
01:10:49.121 --> 01:10:51.440
<v Speaker 3>remember or the things you remembered at</v>
<v Speaker 3>one point and don't remember anymore.</v>

1630
01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:54.740
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hold at episodes of my life.</v>

1631
01:10:54.741 --> 01:10:57.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched like an old fear factory run.</v>

1632
01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:02.860
<v Speaker 3>I had no recollection of any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was only 10 years ago and I'm </v>

1633
01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:03.800
<v Speaker 3>watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember this.</v>

1634
01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember this happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember this.</v>

1635
01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:10.780
<v Speaker 3>This is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have the two earliest memories I have </v>

1636
01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:12.140
<v Speaker 3>when is breaking a pickle jar at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>grocery store?</v>

1637
01:11:12.141 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the huge and it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember</v>

1638
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.980
<v Speaker 7>it being scary.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember like doing it and stuff like </v>

1639
01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:18.980
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And falling in,</v>

1640
01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:18.980
<v Speaker 7>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it was like two or three when it</v>

1641
01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:23.781
<v Speaker 7>happened and the other one is getting </v>
<v Speaker 7>attacked by a bunch of chickens at this </v>

1642
01:11:23.781 --> 01:11:23.781
<v Speaker 7>farm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I got picked.</v>

1643
01:11:23.781 --> 01:11:25.500
<v Speaker 7>I think I've said that before where I </v>
<v Speaker 7>got back and I have a scar in between my</v>

1644
01:11:25.501 --> 01:11:30.060
<v Speaker 7>nose because I was near a chicken nest.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Eat Chicken every day,</v>

1645
01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:35.160
<v Speaker 7>but fried chicken every day with one </v>
<v Speaker 7>hand on my Dick.</v>

1646
01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:37.950
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But both of those memories I remember,</v>

1647
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:40.380
<v Speaker 7>like I remember that happening.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember the pickle jar.</v>

1648
01:11:40.381 --> 01:11:44.580
<v Speaker 7>I remember being attacked by chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I don't remember it in first person.</v>

1649
01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:47.930
<v Speaker 7>I remember kind of being above and </v>
<v Speaker 7>looking down at myself while my.</v>

1650
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:52.950
<v Speaker 7>Well that's the files you've got handed </v>
<v Speaker 7>down the third person view with those </v>

1651
01:11:53.071 --> 01:11:56.160
<v Speaker 7>both stories that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the family liked to tell.</v>

1652
01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:58.650
<v Speaker 7>Like remember we know that huge pickle </v>
<v Speaker 7>jar.</v>

1653
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.680
<v Speaker 7>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like every time I bring it up to my mom,</v>

1654
01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:03.160
<v Speaker 7>she has no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She has no idea.</v>

1655
01:12:03.161 --> 01:12:04.710
<v Speaker 7>I have to like remember.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then she goes,</v>

1656
01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:07.380
<v Speaker 7>that wasn't an important file for her </v>
<v Speaker 7>when she was.</v>

1657
01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.600
<v Speaker 7>She didn't need to remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1658
01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:14.930
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 7>remember important shit that happened to</v>
<v Speaker 7>you and that's a big thing like breaking</v>

<v Speaker 7>a pickle jar.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Come on by.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I almost fell off a cliff.</v>

1666
01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:29.690
<v Speaker 3>I almost fell off a cliff in San </v>
<v Speaker 3>Francisco.</v>

1672
01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:44.690
<v Speaker 3>Some little areas we walk like down near</v>
<v Speaker 3>the beach that are really kind of </v>

1673

<v Speaker 3>sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1674
01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:47.150
<v Speaker 3>there's some areas we could fall down </v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>immensely fucking beautiful but so scary</v>

<v Speaker 3>like their crackling like they have?</v>

1681
01:13:05.710 --> 01:13:06.830

<v Speaker 3>Stuff?</v>

<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>

1684
01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:17.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what makes your balls feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're going around the whole </v>

1685
01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.200
<v Speaker 3>Pacific coast highway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at that fucking cliff,</v>

<v Speaker 3>right there,</v>

1687
01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:26.690
<v Speaker 3>and it's forever and the ground moves </v>
<v Speaker 3>around this bitch all the time.</v>

1688
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:30.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're essentially playing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>game of musical chairs.</v>

1689
01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:35.320
<v Speaker 3>You're just hoping you can get from this</v>
<v Speaker 3>point to that point where the really </v>

1690
01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:39.491
<v Speaker 3>thin fucking outcropping that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little metal boxes driving around with </v>

1692
01:13:43.661 --> 01:13:46.580
<v Speaker 3>ground and the rocks in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never drive it in a storm.</v>

1693
01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:48.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1695
01:13:50.631 --> 01:13:51.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's like a,</v>

1696

<v Speaker 3>this is a crazy drive man.</v>

1701
01:14:04.491 --> 01:14:08.660
<v Speaker 3>It's weird to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a mind fuck.</v>

1702

<v Speaker 3>lane.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You get bumped off into the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>great blue yonder of the ocean floor.</v>

1709
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy way to drive.</v>

1710
01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:42.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to.</v>

1711
01:14:42.981 --> 01:14:46.060
<v Speaker 3>I like to have less worry about death in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my drawer.</v>

1712
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:49.040
<v Speaker 7>Driving is always scary to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean just today I was driving,</v>

1713
01:14:49.041 --> 01:14:54.041
<v Speaker 7>there was fucking like a sandbag truck </v>
<v Speaker 7>overturned or something like that and </v>

1714
01:14:54.041 --> 01:14:55.100
<v Speaker 7>they're just sandbags everywhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>highway out of nowhere.</v>

1715
01:14:55.101 --> 01:14:57.360
<v Speaker 7>Like you're just driving all these sand </v>
<v Speaker 7>bags.</v>

1716
01:14:57.390 --> 01:15:02.390

<v Speaker 3>Section of track.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Someone had dropped on the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>highway.</v>

1721
01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:14.180
<v Speaker 3>I was driving and I saw it last minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw this thing and I was like,</v>

1722
01:15:14.490 --> 01:15:19.490
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember gripping with both </v>

1723
01:15:19.490 --> 01:15:23.421
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way I could turn if I tried </v>

1724
01:15:23.421 --> 01:15:23.421
<v Speaker 3>to turn out what I would have flipped </v>
<v Speaker 3>the car,</v>

1725
01:15:23.421 --> 01:15:24.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just too close and I hit it and I</v>

1726
01:15:24.571 --> 01:15:29.571
<v Speaker 3>got the car launched into the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the carwash and blew the fucking tires </v>

1727
01:15:31.141 --> 01:15:33.060
<v Speaker 3>right off the rims.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the bolt,</v>

1728
01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:38.240
<v Speaker 3>I think at least one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally was shredded and I drove </v>

1729
01:15:38.461 --> 01:15:43.461
<v Speaker 3>on rims to the next exit and got out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just called the tow truck and had it </v>

1730
01:15:43.461 --> 01:15:45.840
<v Speaker 3>dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was a spooky moment.</v>

1731
01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hit that fucking thing.</v>

1732
01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:49.260
<v Speaker 3>I sought last minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1733
01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's metal.</v>

1734
01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:55.730
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like that thing fucking.</v>

1735
01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:59.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not lucky.</v>

1736
01:15:59.491 --> 01:16:00.270
<v Speaker 3>It didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1737
01:16:00.271 --> 01:16:02.640
<v Speaker 3>sometimes when you drive over something </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

1738
01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:06.030
<v Speaker 3>like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can rip out the bottom of your car,</v>

1739
01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:11.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could come up and it can go into the </v>

1740
01:16:11.210 --> 01:16:11.210
<v Speaker 3>bottom of your car and can drop a tranny</v>
<v Speaker 3>real easy.</v>

1741
01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:14.430
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to say that in adult life,</v>

1742
01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:20.120
<v Speaker 3>a dropped his tranny in highschool guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>are blow their fucking their </v>

1743
01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.030
<v Speaker 3>transmission apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing donuts.</v>

1744
01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:24.450
<v Speaker 3>There was a common thing guys would fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>up their trainees.</v>

1745
01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:28.020
<v Speaker 3>We'd hear him driving the next day here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the transmission best find clank,</v>

1746
01:16:28.021 --> 01:16:33.021
<v Speaker 3>clank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clank clank because guys were doing </v>

1747
01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:33.021
<v Speaker 3>smoke shows.</v>

1748
01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:36.420
<v Speaker 7>It's San Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When I was in high school there was </v>

1749
01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:38.311
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was this street where it was kind </v>

1750
01:16:38.311 --> 01:16:38.430
<v Speaker 7>of like a San Francisco style street </v>
<v Speaker 7>where it went down,</v>

1751
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:43.470
<v Speaker 7>it went pretty steep and then straight </v>
<v Speaker 7>for just a bit and then steep again and </v>

1752
01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:46.210
<v Speaker 7>you could fuck in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You could get air and you know,</v>

1753
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:50.800
<v Speaker 7>if you want it to going down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so we would intentionally drive fast</v>

1754
01:16:50.801 --> 01:16:53.060
<v Speaker 7>enough to get the car up into the air.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it was like,</v>

1755
01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:55.900
<v Speaker 7>it's the dumbest thing you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Most people don't know,</v>

1756
01:16:55.930 --> 01:16:57.760
<v Speaker 7>but we all got away with it because,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1757
01:16:57.790 --> 01:17:00.070
<v Speaker 7>everyone just did it a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The dukes of Hazzard,</v>

1758
01:17:00.090 --> 01:17:02.380
<v Speaker 7>I believe you ever fuck your car.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1759
01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:07.410
<v Speaker 7>did you ever break it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>W W one time on another hill driving </v>

1760
01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:08.290
<v Speaker 7>with some friends as a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

1761
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:09.590
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or as a joke,</v>

1762
01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 7>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for</v>

1763
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:15.070
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason I was gonna I was trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to throw the car in neutral and I throw </v>

1764
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:17.150
<v Speaker 3>it into reverse while going know quickly</v>
<v Speaker 3>downhill.</v>

1765
01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:20.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh my fucking noise at that made with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1766
01:17:20.931 --> 01:17:21.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1767
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:24.170
<v Speaker 3>I immediately had to just pull the car </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and,</v>

1768
01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:24.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get it,</v>

1769
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:28.330
<v Speaker 3>get it towed and get it fixed and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>exploded your transmission.</v>

1770
01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:28.660
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1771
01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:30.710
<v Speaker 3>just really they shouldn't be able to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1772
01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:32.580
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be able to go into reverse </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1773
01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:35.240
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was like an old.</v>

1774
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:37.210
<v Speaker 3>It was like an AMC Hornet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1775
01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:38.700
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1776
01:17:38.730 --> 01:17:42.020
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty dumb why you're going in </v>
<v Speaker 3>for direction.</v>

1777
01:17:42.021 --> 01:17:47.021
<v Speaker 3>Isn't there a way to engineer some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a way that doesn't just think you </v>

1778
01:17:47.021 --> 01:17:47.920
<v Speaker 3>can't anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you are.</v>

1779
01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:49.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to kind of,</v>

1780
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:50.670
<v Speaker 3>you move it to the side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1781
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:54.480
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like a stick shift where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to kind of a medicine bottle or cut</v>

1782
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.840
<v Speaker 3>into each each level or whatever.</v>

1783
01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.460
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid,</v>

1784
01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:00.350
<v Speaker 3>teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you a silly,</v>

1785
01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:01.610
<v Speaker 3>goofy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>odd,</v>

1786
01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.790
<v Speaker 3>did so much silly shit when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1787
01:18:03.791 --> 01:18:05.690
<v Speaker 3>The kids should be allowed to drive </v>
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>

1788
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so now when I'm driving around and </v>

1789
01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:10.810
<v Speaker 3>if I get cut off by somebody that looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're 15,</v>

1790
01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:12.380
<v Speaker 3>16.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just like such assholes.</v>

1791
01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:16.820
<v Speaker 3>Like also when I was that age I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was an asshole driver,</v>

1792
01:18:16.821 --> 01:18:20.690
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't have all I had was maybe an</v>
<v Speaker 3>occasional fast food from the driving.</v>

1793
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:22.730
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have texting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1794
01:18:22.731 --> 01:18:27.731
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have headphones on or all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>

1795
01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:32.690
<v Speaker 3>all the distractions of today and now I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't believe that there's any,</v>

1796
01:18:33.090 --> 01:18:35.040
<v Speaker 3>there's anywhere in a car that has a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1797
01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:35.830
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1798
01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.270
<v Speaker 3>a TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not like,</v>

1799
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:39.920
<v Speaker 3>there's not like a limo that's being </v>
<v Speaker 3>driven by a professional.</v>

1800
01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:40.650
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1801
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:45.850
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just even if you have your kids in the </v>

1802
01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:47.591
<v Speaker 3>backseat watching some shit on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't that be an extra distraction </v>

1803
01:18:47.591 --> 01:18:47.830
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1804
01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:52.840
<v Speaker 3>it's the opposite dangerous or you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like how focused it makes the kids to </v>

1805
01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:53.680
<v Speaker 3>kids zone out for kids are done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But why do you.</v>

1806
01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:57.440
<v Speaker 3>But you definitely don't need a TV up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up above the rear view mirror.</v>

1807
01:18:57.441 --> 01:18:58.280
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's stupid.</v>

1808
01:18:58.281 --> 01:19:00.620
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't see that's,</v>

1809
01:19:00.850 --> 01:19:02.810
<v Speaker 3>that's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I rented a car,</v>

1810
01:19:02.811 --> 01:19:07.811
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I rented a who was an escalator </v>

1811
01:19:07.811 --> 01:19:08.630
<v Speaker 3>navigator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those and that's what the TV was.</v>

1812
01:19:08.631 --> 01:19:11.900
<v Speaker 3>The TV would come down in the center and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would block the view.</v>

1813
01:19:11.901 --> 01:19:12.830
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't see,</v>

1814
01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:15.330
<v Speaker 3>you look over your rear view or like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1815
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:21.250
<v Speaker 3>to watch it when you're not in motion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to watch an emotion </v>

1816
01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:21.250
<v Speaker 3>because the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1817
01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:21.560
<v Speaker 3>that's when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the tunes amount,</v>

1818
01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:26.800
<v Speaker 3>but the better ones are on the headsets </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now they have them on the headsets </v>

1819
01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:26.800
<v Speaker 3>where you can have a.</v>

1820
01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:30.350
<v Speaker 3>each one is watching a different thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>so they can watch their headphones.</v>

1821
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:33.770
<v Speaker 3>When you have limited time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a three and a half year old.</v>

1822
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:36.230
<v Speaker 3>That's the perfect shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just zonked out.</v>

1823
01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:38.990
<v Speaker 3>No more questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a watch.</v>

1824
01:19:38.991 --> 01:19:42.470
<v Speaker 3>Dora the explorer and they have a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>old fucking time so they don't even mind</v>

1825
01:19:42.471 --> 01:19:43.670
<v Speaker 3>driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1826
01:19:43.671 --> 01:19:48.671
<v Speaker 3>they don't mind driving because driving </v>
<v Speaker 3>for them it's like going to the movies </v>

1827
01:19:48.671 --> 01:19:51.460
<v Speaker 3>they have like cool little dvds they </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch and they have a good time and the </v>

1828
01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:52.910
<v Speaker 3>dvds you can get like little educational</v>
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>

1829
01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:56.390
<v Speaker 3>So it's actually good for them.</v>

1832
01:20:04.481 --> 01:20:07.060
<v Speaker 3>than we were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't get access to anything until </v>

1833
01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:07.060
<v Speaker 3>we were fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna be cool in the future.</v>

1834
01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:08.060
<v Speaker 3>I bet you the babies</v>

1835
01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:13.060
<v Speaker 7>are going to be so smart at such a young</v>
<v Speaker 7>age that they're going to be able to </v>

1836
01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:13.060
<v Speaker 7>drive cars for you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they're going to be like,</v>

1837
01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:14.190
<v Speaker 7>as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 7>being able to see the babies,</v>

1838
01:20:14.191 --> 01:20:19.191
<v Speaker 7>then we're going to be able to drive for</v>
<v Speaker 7>you firing of the mine where you didn't </v>

1839
01:20:21.151 --> 01:20:24.690
<v Speaker 7>think about that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Babies out of the womb,</v>

1840
01:20:24.691 --> 01:20:27.120
<v Speaker 7>we're just going to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You never know they could drive everyone</v>

1841
01:20:27.121 --> 01:20:29.370
<v Speaker 7>around.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Driving is gonna be so easy because it's</v>

1842
01:20:29.371 --> 01:20:34.371
<v Speaker 7>all going to have magnets around your </v>
<v Speaker 7>whole car that they just have to push </v>

1843
01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:34.890
<v Speaker 7>one button for like on or sign.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're such a silly man.</v>

1844
01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:37.410
<v Speaker 7>Such a silly mad,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

1845
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:38.880
<v Speaker 7>Why do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why do you want more babies?</v>

1846
01:20:38.881 --> 01:20:43.881
<v Speaker 7>I need more drivers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I need more people driving me around </v>

1847
01:20:43.881 --> 01:20:47.020
<v Speaker 7>that I don't ever see and knowing no one</v>
<v Speaker 7>wouldn't want to have sex with.</v>

1848
01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:48.750
<v Speaker 7>It would just be a matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1849
01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:54.010
<v Speaker 3>life experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have full intelligence right </v>

1850
01:20:54.010 --> 01:20:54.010
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just needed life experience.</v>

1851
01:20:54.010 --> 01:20:56.230
<v Speaker 3>So we make you work as a driver for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first years.</v>

1852
01:20:57.350 --> 01:21:02.350
<v Speaker 3>People are going to be a DM or smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be in some areas </v>

1853
01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:04.370
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be dumber because some </v>
<v Speaker 3>things are going to become obsolete.</v>

1854
01:21:04.371 --> 01:21:06.740
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not going to ever need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know a phone number.</v>

1855
01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:11.390
<v Speaker 3>Math maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but hopefully people will adaptation,</v>

1856
01:21:11.391 --> 01:21:12.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what's going on.</v>

1857
01:21:12.891 --> 01:21:16.280
<v Speaker 3>We're adapting to this new environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're adapting to these new needs.</v>

1858
01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:21.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unquestionably something's </v>

1859
01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.860
<v Speaker 3>happening and we're getting to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbiotic relationship with technology,</v>

1860
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:30.130
<v Speaker 3>but can you imagine how much space in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain is available that would 15,</v>

1861
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:35.630
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago be full of phone numbers </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't need to remember anymore,</v>

1862
01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:37.670
<v Speaker 3>but don't you remember a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different things now?</v>

1863
01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:42.760
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think that you have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information that you get through the </v>

1864
01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:42.920
<v Speaker 3>Internet that probably would never get </v>
<v Speaker 3>before?</v>

1865
01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:44.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people,</v>

1866
01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:49.360
<v Speaker 3>it was difficult for them to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulated in the days before the </v>

1867
01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:52.331
<v Speaker 3>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but today there's not a time in the </v>

1868
01:21:52.331 --> 01:21:52.331
<v Speaker 3>world where I'm in an airport that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>wifi.</v>

1869
01:21:52.331 --> 01:21:53.560
<v Speaker 3>We're on board yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1870
01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:55.140
<v Speaker 3>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the airport wife.</v>

1871
01:21:55.190 --> 01:22:00.190
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you just sit there and you can </v>

1872
01:22:00.190 --> 01:22:01.280
<v Speaker 3>either goof around or get stuff done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but either way you're killing the time.</v>

1873
01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:02.830
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1874
01:22:02.831 --> 01:22:03.220
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1875
01:22:03.221 --> 01:22:03.920
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1876
01:22:03.921 --> 01:22:06.530
<v Speaker 3>you're enjoying yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're actually having a good time.</v>

1877
01:22:06.531 --> 01:22:11.531
<v Speaker 3>You're getting entertained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you are also using a different than </v>

1878
01:22:11.531 --> 01:22:11.531
<v Speaker 3>some people</v>

1879
01:22:11.531 --> 01:22:15.610
<v Speaker 7>use the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people just go in there and </v>

1880
01:22:15.610 --> 01:22:16.100
<v Speaker 7>play cards and talk about video games.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have</v>

1881
01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:21.100
<v Speaker 3>a say if you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an hour to kill and you were at the </v>

1882
01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:21.100
<v Speaker 3>airport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1883
01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:24.851
<v Speaker 3>you log on your favorite video game for </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and you find out what the hell's </v>

1884
01:22:24.851 --> 01:22:27.710
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's entertaining and then listen to </v>

1885
01:22:27.710 --> 01:22:29.440
<v Speaker 3>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>

1886
01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:32.030
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very interesting,</v>

1887
01:22:32.031 --> 01:22:36.290
<v Speaker 3>like a progression to try to like look </v>
<v Speaker 3>ahead too.</v>

1888
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:39.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like what the fuck is this going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go next?</v>

1889
01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:44.400
<v Speaker 3>Like what does the next symbiotic </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship between human beings and </v>

1890
01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:47.651
<v Speaker 3>technology?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the cell phone is pretty much a </v>

1891
01:22:47.651 --> 01:22:47.870
<v Speaker 3>part of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's next phase?</v>

1892
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:52.930
<v Speaker 3>People having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really think it's actual fake </v>

1893
01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:53.420
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flashlights that have emotions.</v>

1894
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:59.350
<v Speaker 3>It's the fucking same emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can turn it off the emotions that </v>

1895
01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:03.431
<v Speaker 3>would get people dick hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do like porn where this seems to be </v>

1896
01:23:03.431 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 3>having fun more than porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas people seem to be,</v>

1897
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just watched the other day that was </v>

1898
01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.371
<v Speaker 5>just random.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People like watching porn where people </v>

1899
01:23:14.371 --> 01:23:14.950
<v Speaker 5>fight and then they fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then when they fuck the,</v>

1900
01:23:14.951 --> 01:23:15.970
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1901
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.110
<v Speaker 5>get back at each other and then resolve </v>
<v Speaker 5>their issues through fucking like people</v>

1902
01:23:20.111 --> 01:23:25.111
<v Speaker 5>liked those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They like videos like that when people </v>

1903
01:23:25.111 --> 01:23:25.111
<v Speaker 5>were actually angry at each other </v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's when they have their best</v>

1904
01:23:25.111 --> 01:23:30.040
<v Speaker 5>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people have the best sex they </v>

1905
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:30.040
<v Speaker 5>ever have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's makeup sex.</v>

1906
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:33.690
<v Speaker 5>Like this girl that will like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I firmly believe they have learned to </v>

1907
01:23:33.690 --> 01:23:35.770
<v Speaker 5>start fights so that the man will step </v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

1908
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:40.830
<v Speaker 5>are you with them for a little bit?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then they resolve everything they make </v>

1909
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:43.771
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They say they love you and then they </v>

1910
01:23:43.771 --> 01:23:45.281
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they love it and they have like </v>

1911
01:23:45.281 --> 01:23:46.560
<v Speaker 5>super extra charge fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think they start problems and men </v>

1912
01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:47.860
<v Speaker 5>and women I'm sure because they like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>store.</v>

1913
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:52.060
<v Speaker 5>It's why women can read a pornographic </v>
<v Speaker 5>things and men need to see them.</v>

1914
01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:57.120
<v Speaker 5>It's women like the story the women </v>
<v Speaker 5>liked what leads up to having the </v>

1915
01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:01.380
<v Speaker 5>foreplay sold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They like drama crazy for you like it to</v>

1916
01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:02.860
<v Speaker 5>have a beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>middle and end.</v>

1917
01:24:02.861 --> 01:24:05.710
<v Speaker 5>And then the and has to go on for longer</v>
<v Speaker 5>than we want it to.</v>

1918
01:24:06.010 --> 01:24:10.920
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever thought what it would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>like to be a woman for a day or every 10</v>

1919
01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:16.270
<v Speaker 5>years that microwave with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cantaloupe?</v>

1920
01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:21.280
<v Speaker 5>Dang.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian's life would be not much </v>

1921
01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:21.280
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would just be a lesbian.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I've said this before where when I was </v>

1924
01:24:26.891 --> 01:24:29.251
<v Speaker 5>younger I would like look at my boobs </v>
<v Speaker 5>and act like they were real boobs and </v>

1925
01:24:29.251 --> 01:24:30.870
<v Speaker 5>then try to kiss him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's about as close as to.</v>

1926
01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:33.130
<v Speaker 5>That's the question though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're.</v>

1931
01:24:40.821 --> 01:24:45.400

1945
01:25:27.791 --> 01:25:31.170
<v Speaker 5>they often act like it's the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>delicious thing could have.</v>

1946
01:25:31.210 --> 01:25:34.010
<v Speaker 5>So I know most girls are just started </v>
<v Speaker 5>like just doing,</v>

1947
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:36.010
<v Speaker 5>just doing what they gotta do to get it </v>
<v Speaker 5>over with.</v>

1948
01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.910
<v Speaker 5>Some girls know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some girls love Derek.</v>

1949
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:43.390
<v Speaker 5>You've got to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know why it's kind of gross of a </v>

1950
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:44.170
<v Speaker 5>girl sucking your cock and she doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to.</v>

1951
01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:48.880
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't want to like wants to please </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1952
01:25:48.881 --> 01:25:51.210
<v Speaker 5>but also doesn't think it's the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>delicious thing.</v>

1953
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:53.470
<v Speaker 5>She's like eating pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't get any posts.</v>

1954
01:25:53.471 --> 01:25:54.220
<v Speaker 5>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

1955
01:25:54.221 --> 01:25:59.221
<v Speaker 5>But how could anybody think I love the </v>
<v Speaker 5>pleasing the person is or maybe a little</v>

1956
01:25:59.711 --> 01:26:04.110
<v Speaker 5>sense of control is the most important </v>
<v Speaker 5>part than then</v>

1957
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.450
<v Speaker 8>how it tastes and looks and feels.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those are all good too,</v>

1958
01:26:08.451 --> 01:26:10.490
<v Speaker 8>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think that it's more like,</v>

1959
01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:12.440
<v Speaker 8>it's just fun.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's just fun to,</v>

1960
01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:17.500
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because that's a great way to please a </v>

1961
01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:17.500
<v Speaker 8>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Doug Benson and putting it out there,</v>

1962
01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:22.500
<v Speaker 1>bitches as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you will.</v>

1963
01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.580
<v Speaker 1>How often do you eat out,</v>

1964
01:26:26.250 --> 01:26:27.600
<v Speaker 8>have,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1965
01:26:27.670 --> 01:26:32.410
<v Speaker 1>whenever it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever the time is right,</v>

1966
01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.720
<v Speaker 1>maybe some brunch will be some happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour</v>

1967
01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.280
<v Speaker 8>maybe after dinner as eating.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What does that mean?</v>

1968
01:26:38.281 --> 01:26:40.260
<v Speaker 8>Eating ass licking a girl's asshole</v>

1969
01:26:41.670 --> 01:26:44.310
<v Speaker 1>don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love when people,</v>

1970
01:26:44.311 --> 01:26:45.660
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about something and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1971
01:26:45.870 --> 01:26:47.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they say,</v>

1972
01:26:47.131 --> 01:26:48.260
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1973
01:26:48.261 --> 01:26:49.470
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>

1974
01:26:49.810 --> 01:26:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

1975
01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Frenching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a no,</v>

1976
01:26:52.291 --> 01:26:54.930
<v Speaker 1>but that's an immediate reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when someone says,</v>

1977
01:26:54.931 --> 01:26:55.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1978
01:26:56.150 --> 01:27:01.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's what that same Dusky </v>

1979
01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:01.150
<v Speaker 1>guy should have said when they asked him</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you were attracted to young boys.</v>

1980
01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1981
01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:03.090
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead he's like,</v>

1982
01:27:03.091 --> 01:27:05.640
<v Speaker 1>he repeated like asked me again if I eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ass.</v>

1983
01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you eat a lot of ass too?</v>

1984
01:27:07.411 --> 01:27:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1985
01:27:12.250 --> 01:27:16.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the world's greatest athlete.</v>

1986
01:27:18.690 --> 01:27:20.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a world champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1987
01:27:21.630 --> 01:27:26.630
<v Speaker 1>the stacks of theater don't eat enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This should totally be trophies for the </v>

1988
01:27:26.630 --> 01:27:26.630
<v Speaker 1>best</v>

1989
01:27:26.630 --> 01:27:28.660
<v Speaker 8>assay eating.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's a God damn adventure.</v>

1990
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:32.330
<v Speaker 8>You can get trophies for parasailing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Who should get trophies for ass eating.</v>

1991
01:27:33.490 --> 01:27:38.490
<v Speaker 8>Why not asking in contests?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What if the world were free and we </v>

1992
01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:42.691
<v Speaker 8>weren't so worried about things.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Pornography could be judged on the </v>

1993
01:27:42.691 --> 01:27:46.350
<v Speaker 8>merits of technique.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Zero percent toilet paper in the ass is </v>

1994
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:48.040
<v Speaker 8>always important.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's very important.</v>

1995
01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:53.130
<v Speaker 8>Toilet paper when you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when you go down on a girl and you find </v>

1996
01:27:53.130 --> 01:27:54.880
<v Speaker 8>toilet paper just dangling off her ass </v>
<v Speaker 8>and so disturbing that it's probably one</v>

1997
01:27:54.881 --> 01:27:57.540
<v Speaker 8>of the things that keeps me out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>out of that region.</v>

1998
01:27:57.550 --> 01:28:02.550
<v Speaker 8>It's just could backfire.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I had back in so it's not ruin anything.</v>

1999
01:28:03.701 --> 01:28:05.680
<v Speaker 8>I don't want her to be upset.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I get a little stubble.</v>

2000
01:28:05.681 --> 01:28:06.910
<v Speaker 8>It's like essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2001
01:28:06.911 --> 01:28:11.911
<v Speaker 8>it's like a little bit of sandpaper.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You rubbed some toilet paper on some </v>

2002
01:28:11.911 --> 01:28:14.350
<v Speaker 8>sandpaper.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're gonna leave some residue.</v>

2003
01:28:14.410 --> 01:28:15.850
<v Speaker 8>Do you like stuff in your ass?</v>

2004
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:17.080
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2005
01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:21.060
<v Speaker 1>You said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually very scared.</v>

2006
01:28:21.090 --> 01:28:26.090
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the end of a long conversation </v>

2007
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:26.090
<v Speaker 1>like stuffing your ass.</v>

2008
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:28.220
<v Speaker 8>I'm very scared of my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if I told her.</v>

2009
01:28:28.230 --> 01:28:30.730
<v Speaker 8>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's good I guess in my diet.</v>

2010
01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.170
<v Speaker 8>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Your meat diet,</v>

2011
01:28:32.530 --> 01:28:34.930
<v Speaker 8>how often are you vegetables?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I eat them every day,</v>

2012
01:28:34.931 --> 01:28:39.931
<v Speaker 8>but that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what you should do is what </v>

2013
01:28:39.931 --> 01:28:41.620
<v Speaker 8>I do and I just need to get on,</v>
<v Speaker 8>get on the Kale shakes.</v>

2014
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:44.260
<v Speaker 8>I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not that delicious,</v>

2015
01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:48.250
<v Speaker 8>but I don't mind eating Kale so much.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I kind of picked that up every once in a</v>

2016
01:28:48.251 --> 01:28:53.251
<v Speaker 8>while.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like the whole foods or something like </v>

2017
01:28:53.251 --> 01:28:53.251
<v Speaker 8>along with the.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2018
01:28:53.251 --> 01:28:53.251
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

2019
01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:58.380
<v Speaker 8>Not Bad,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but a shake of Kevin James turned me </v>

2020
01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:01.681
<v Speaker 8>onto this shit and um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he started doing it in the lost like 80 </v>

2021
01:29:01.681 --> 01:29:02.190
<v Speaker 8>pounds when he's doing essentially</v>

2022
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:04.530
<v Speaker 3>takes cucumbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kale,</v>

2023
01:29:04.531 --> 01:29:05.250
<v Speaker 3>celery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2024
01:29:05.251 --> 01:29:06.210
<v Speaker 3>how I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cucumbers,</v>

2025
01:29:06.211 --> 01:29:06.960
<v Speaker 3>Kale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>celery,</v>

2026
01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:09.360
<v Speaker 3>and I put a chunk of ginger in there </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

2027
01:29:09.361 --> 01:29:12.540
<v Speaker 3>And a whole pear ginger anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It drives me crazy.</v>

2028
01:29:12.541 --> 01:29:14.100
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate gender like that.</v>

2029
01:29:14.101 --> 01:29:15.930
<v Speaker 3>I like to put some gas in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2030
01:29:15.931 --> 01:29:18.450
<v Speaker 3>pull the last name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the sting of ginger.</v>

2031
01:29:18.451 --> 01:29:20.730
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2032
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:25.810
<v Speaker 3>it's very spicy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I liked that it's good for you and </v>

2033
01:29:25.810 --> 01:29:27.600
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I blend it all up in this vitamix thing.</v>

2034
01:29:27.601 --> 01:29:32.601
<v Speaker 3>You ever see a vitamix?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a mixer designed to to </v>

2035
01:29:32.601 --> 01:29:35.420
<v Speaker 3>pulverize it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really juicing because it's </v>

2036
01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:38.391
<v Speaker 3>just chopping the living fuck out of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these vegetables until it's like a soup </v>

2037
01:29:38.391 --> 01:29:41.580
<v Speaker 3>and then you drink this soup and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking.</v>

2038
01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:43.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't taste bad.</v>

2039
01:29:43.410 --> 01:29:48.060
<v Speaker 3>It's just sort of a task and you lose </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight because you're losing weight,</v>

2040
01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.760
<v Speaker 3>vegetables and there's no other feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

2041
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:53.790
<v Speaker 3>You feel it's a giant serving of </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetables,</v>

2042
01:29:53.791 --> 01:29:56.280
<v Speaker 3>like much more vegetables probably than </v>
<v Speaker 3>you would ever really eat.</v>

2043
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:58.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to force myself to eat.</v>

2044
01:29:58.201 --> 01:30:01.860
<v Speaker 3>Most of it can eat like six giant leaves</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Kale,</v>

2045
01:30:01.861 --> 01:30:04.440
<v Speaker 3>10 stalks of Celery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a whole cucumber.</v>

2046
01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:07.140
<v Speaker 3>It's rare that you would eat that many </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetables in one sitting.</v>

2047
01:30:07.141 --> 01:30:12.141
<v Speaker 3>You could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is even better because it's </v>

2048
01:30:12.141 --> 01:30:12.750
<v Speaker 3>completely taken the whole chewing down </v>
<v Speaker 3>process out.</v>

2049
01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:14.910
<v Speaker 3>So you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're digesting it,</v>

2050
01:30:14.911 --> 01:30:18.360
<v Speaker 3>you're swallowing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like just incinerated,</v>

2051
01:30:18.361 --> 01:30:23.361
<v Speaker 3>just chopped up into little tiny pieces </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like really easily absorbed by </v>

2052
01:30:23.361 --> 01:30:27.171
<v Speaker 3>your body and your shit's magnifical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shits become easier because.</v>

2053
01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:32.640
<v Speaker 3>So lubed up to though do your whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>system is just whenever you have.</v>

2054
01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:37.670
<v Speaker 3>If you have a steak later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it slides out like a Toboggan for your </v>

2055
01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:40.380
<v Speaker 3>vitamix Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a late night drink,</v>

2056
01:30:40.381 --> 01:30:44.010
<v Speaker 3>like with some food vodka,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ice,</v>

2057
01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:47.200
<v Speaker 3>a red seedless grapes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of red seat lit,</v>

2058
01:30:47.210 --> 01:30:51.120
<v Speaker 3>scrapes and a little bit to apples and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2059
01:30:51.150 --> 01:30:53.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like grape Fyedka,</v>

2060
01:30:53.550 --> 01:30:55.980
<v Speaker 3>but like it's got a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>texture to it.</v>

2061
01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:57.390
<v Speaker 3>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

2062
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:58.860
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great idea.</v>

2063
01:30:58.861 --> 01:31:01.830
<v Speaker 3>So you make like a little smoothing mega</v>
<v Speaker 3>little smitty and if you,</v>

2064
01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:03.010
<v Speaker 3>if you have any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2065
01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:04.230
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2066
01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:08.130
<v Speaker 3>what's that sweetener that's made out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cactus or something like that?</v>

2067
01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:09.630
<v Speaker 3>If you have any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put that in there.</v>

2068
01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Dva?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2069
01:31:11.130 --> 01:31:12.870
<v Speaker 3>You can use to Gaba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gaba,</v>

2070
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:16.500
<v Speaker 3>I use the Gaba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gaba is not so good for you.</v>

2071
01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:19.350
<v Speaker 3>It's why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2072
01:31:19.351 --> 01:31:24.351
<v Speaker 3>I read that somewhere I need to research</v>
<v Speaker 3>that somebody had said that a Gaba is </v>

2073
01:31:24.351 --> 01:31:25.240
<v Speaker 3>not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think like any artificial sweeteners,</v>

2074
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:29.170
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2075
01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:31.170
<v Speaker 3>they make a tequila out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2076
01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:35.760
<v Speaker 3>But it's a plant is a plant and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>real sweet plant and you know,</v>

2077
01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:38.760
<v Speaker 3>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another they make to kill out</v>

2078
01:31:38.761 --> 01:31:43.410
<v Speaker 3>of that process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that word a lot associated with.</v>

2079
01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.730
<v Speaker 3>I made lemonade the other day with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the garbage.</v>

2080
01:31:45.810 --> 01:31:47.820
<v Speaker 3>It was really delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was drinking.</v>

2081
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:49.260
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably not so good for you.</v>

2082
01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:50.280
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2083
01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:52.350
<v Speaker 3>No?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stevia is supposed to be good for you,</v>

2084
01:31:52.351 --> 01:31:55.140
<v Speaker 3>but Stevia to me is not like a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>sweet taste.</v>

2085
01:31:55.290 --> 01:31:56.340
<v Speaker 3>It's like a trick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sweet.</v>

2086
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

2087
01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:59.830
<v Speaker 3>almost like an aspirin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that old shit?</v>

2088
01:31:59.831 --> 01:32:00.030
<v Speaker 3>Sweet</v>

2089
01:32:00.030 --> 01:32:01.490
<v Speaker 1>and lows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweet and low hip.</v>

2090
01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Funky fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of sweet,</v>

2091
01:32:03.581 --> 01:32:06.250
<v Speaker 1>but kind of funky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda like it better than,</v>

2092
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:11.310
<v Speaker 1>than any other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem I have is they need to </v>

2093
01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:12.070
<v Speaker 1>have it at more places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like starbucks seems like it should have</v>

2094
01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:15.460
<v Speaker 1>starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people.</v>

2095
01:32:15.461 --> 01:32:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a taste issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't prefer the taste of it.</v>

2096
01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably something you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get used to,</v>

2097
01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:22.480
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like and things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind.</v>

2098
01:32:22.481 --> 01:32:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Things being not sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2099
01:32:24.461 --> 01:32:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Like coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want coffee,</v>

2100
01:32:25.751 --> 01:32:27.370
<v Speaker 1>sweetened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweetened,</v>

2101
01:32:27.371 --> 01:32:28.390
<v Speaker 1>iced tea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iced tea.</v>

2102
01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:29.920
<v Speaker 1>I just drink it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2103
01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't put any extra shit into pretty </v>

2104
01:32:35.250 --> 01:32:35.320
<v Speaker 1>much anything really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want your health,</v>

2105
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.710
<v Speaker 1>do you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2106
01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you take care of herself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go through periods that are,</v>

2107
01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:40.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can go up and down.</v>

2108
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:42.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever eaten.</v>

2109
01:32:42.671 --> 01:32:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Kick in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

2110
01:32:44.650 --> 01:32:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about in the tub?</v>

2111
01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:50.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever eaten food in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tub.</v>

2112
01:32:50.261 --> 01:32:51.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the cat in the hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comes back.</v>

2113
01:32:51.601 --> 01:32:53.500
<v Speaker 1>He kicked in the tub and it becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mess.</v>

2114
01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:58.840
<v Speaker 1>That motherfucker to paraphrase it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2115
01:32:58.841 --> 01:33:02.440
<v Speaker 1>When you read that to your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my kids' favorite stories.</v>

2116
01:33:02.441 --> 01:33:07.441
<v Speaker 1>They're fun because I get into them or </v>
<v Speaker 1>get into the cat in the hat once </v>

2117
01:33:07.441 --> 01:33:07.900
<v Speaker 1>brilliantly written stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frog and toad.</v>

2118
01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:09.180
<v Speaker 1>You got to get them in the frog and </v>
<v Speaker 1>toad.</v>

2119
01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best.</v>

2120
01:33:10.450 --> 01:33:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Remember that frog and toad frog and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attend that live together and they were </v>

2121
01:33:15.450 --> 01:33:17.770
<v Speaker 1>sort of vaguely remember that or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were trying to cross the highway and you</v>

2122
01:33:17.771 --> 01:33:19.200
<v Speaker 1>have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was cool.</v>

2123
01:33:19.230 --> 01:33:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Get into the lily pads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's frogger.</v>

2124
01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:27.250
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that a frog would hang with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the toad the other different yet.</v>

2125
01:33:27.251 --> 01:33:29.800
<v Speaker 1>So this lucky frogs a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those cons.</v>

2126
01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:31.470
<v Speaker 1>You know how he will be.</v>

2127
01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:33.730
<v Speaker 1>If they're big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just be taking kids right out of</v>

2128
01:33:33.731 --> 01:33:35.950
<v Speaker 1>your arm and you seen big frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty big.</v>

2129
01:33:35.951 --> 01:33:39.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean big like real big like dog size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The frogs were huge.</v>

2130
01:33:39.810 --> 01:33:44.810
<v Speaker 1>They eat babies and was about a frog </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent researching frogs long time ago </v>

2131
01:33:44.810 --> 01:33:48.931
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>licking frogs and so I got really into </v>

2132
01:33:48.931 --> 01:33:51.241
<v Speaker 1>frogs and they have pac man frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He received PAC man frogs or mouth's </v>

2133
01:33:51.241 --> 01:33:54.640
<v Speaker 1>open up like PAC man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frog is a ruthless motherfuckers.</v>

2134
01:33:54.641 --> 01:33:54.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

2135
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:59.430
<v Speaker 1>They were like my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes my might have made that up.</v>

2136
01:33:59.550 --> 01:34:04.550
<v Speaker 1>They do those frogs that he dug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2137
01:34:08.710 --> 01:34:11.110
<v Speaker 1>How about the fact that people take </v>
<v Speaker 1>frogs and they get high with them?</v>

2138
01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:15.220
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was researching frogs </v>
<v Speaker 1>because frogs off Ebay a long time.</v>

2139
01:34:15.221 --> 01:34:16.940
<v Speaker 1>I got to something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can buy that.</v>

2140
01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they've made a frog </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal yet.</v>

2141
01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:20.800
<v Speaker 1>What is the frog that does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The frog.</v>

2142
01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:24.820
<v Speaker 1>It producers five Meo DMT is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly potent.</v>

2143
01:34:24.821 --> 01:34:29.821
<v Speaker 1>Helis engine and will you do is you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>this frog and the skin excretes like </v>

2144
01:34:29.821 --> 01:34:34.111
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a white milky substance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it on a window of a car so that </v>

2145
01:34:34.111 --> 01:34:37.660
<v Speaker 1>it's in the sun or anything glass that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside glass coffee table.</v>

2146
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:40.120
<v Speaker 1>You secrete it and then when it dries </v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

2147
01:34:40.121 --> 01:34:42.640
<v Speaker 1>you scrape it with a razor blade and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a white powder.</v>

2148
01:34:42.970 --> 01:34:46.990
<v Speaker 1>You put it in something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you freebase it and you blast off.</v>

2149
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:50.210
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2150
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the center of the universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>provided by a frog.</v>

2151
01:34:54.670 --> 01:34:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's why they ended up </v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2152
01:34:55.681 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 1>I was going to be a bunch of frogs on us</v>

2153
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:02.980
<v Speaker 8>because we're all going to start </v>
<v Speaker 8>tripping off these frogs because it's </v>

2154
01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:02.980
<v Speaker 8>going to be frogs everywhere and then </v>
<v Speaker 8>we're going to go into this Dm.</v>

2155
01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:07.980
<v Speaker 8>Treaties are likely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's tripping off of how justice </v>

2156
01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:10.340
<v Speaker 8>hallucinogen Hallucinogen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hallucinogen hallucinogen.</v>

2157
01:35:10.490 --> 01:35:14.010
<v Speaker 8>That's the correct agenda is what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 8>used to it as well.</v>

2158
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:18.750
<v Speaker 8>It's like nuclear or new cuellar.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're going to have options.</v>

2159
01:35:19.170 --> 01:35:21.890
<v Speaker 8>Other options.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If I said nuclear,</v>

2160
01:35:21.891 --> 01:35:26.891
<v Speaker 8>would you correct?</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like authentically often nuclear </v>

2161
01:35:26.891 --> 01:35:28.910
<v Speaker 8>coupon and coupon nuclear bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 8>nuclear bombs.</v>

2162
01:35:29.230 --> 01:35:30.680
<v Speaker 8>I don't think I are correct.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You out loud.</v>

2163
01:35:30.681 --> 01:35:32.680
<v Speaker 8>I would just assume.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know.</v>

2164
01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:37.640
<v Speaker 8>I just assumed you were gonna you know </v>
<v Speaker 8>like you hear in both ways so often.</v>

2165
01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:42.760
<v Speaker 8>Like if all the dumb things that George </v>
<v Speaker 8>Bush said and did that one to me it was </v>

2166
01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:42.760
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

2167
01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.360
<v Speaker 8>but a lot of people say it the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 8>way,</v>

2168
01:35:44.690 --> 01:35:46.070
<v Speaker 8>so you just get used to it.</v>

2169
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:49.640
<v Speaker 8>It's just like old expressions that now </v>
<v Speaker 8>people say I'm the wrong the wrong way.</v>

2170
01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:52.250
<v Speaker 8>With English.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People write things different.</v>

2171
01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.720
<v Speaker 8>They right there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Correct.</v>

2172
01:35:53.721 --> 01:35:58.721
<v Speaker 8>Tires is t y r e S.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I kept seeing that written an English </v>

2173
01:35:58.721 --> 01:35:59.390
<v Speaker 8>magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

2174
01:35:59.391 --> 01:36:04.391
<v Speaker 8>why is the world world?</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's spelled w r o l d instead of w o r,</v>

2175
01:36:05.331 --> 01:36:05.900
<v Speaker 8>l,</v>
<v Speaker 8>D,</v>

2176
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:09.370
<v Speaker 8>real world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's pronounced wrong.</v>

2177
01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:11.150
<v Speaker 8>Wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Did you just make that up?</v>

2178
01:36:12.170 --> 01:36:14.930
<v Speaker 8>I always get,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I say world and everyone gives me shift.</v>

2179
01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:16.190
<v Speaker 8>So you make that up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2180
01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:19.550
<v Speaker 8>it's not spelled war.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Made that up.</v>

2181
01:36:19.570 --> 01:36:20.500
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You motherfucker.</v>

2183
01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:27.200
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's a bunch of different.</v>

2184
01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:30.050
<v Speaker 8>It's funny when you reading tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't even have to look to see where</v>

2185
01:36:30.051 --> 01:36:32.180
<v Speaker 8>the person's from.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When it's got those things in it.</v>

2186
01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:35.510
<v Speaker 8>Well they also say cheers mate,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and they always say,</v>

2187
01:36:35.511 --> 01:36:37.790
<v Speaker 8>you're a legend isn't legend's mate.</v>

2188
01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:38.690

<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

2189
01:36:38.691 --> 01:36:41.460

<v Speaker 8>Joe Calls Me and says,</v>

2190
01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:43.740
<v Speaker 8>you are a legend.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I love that expression.</v>

2191
01:36:44.150 --> 01:36:46.190
<v Speaker 8>The love that they love,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they love.</v>

2192
01:36:46.191 --> 01:36:47.390
<v Speaker 8>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's a brilliant,</v>

2193
01:36:47.391 --> 01:36:48.200
<v Speaker 8>brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 8>great.</v>

2194
01:36:48.201 --> 01:36:50.170
<v Speaker 8>That's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They retired and con.</v>

2195
01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:55.240
<v Speaker 8>They like to say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I like how you publicly announced that </v>

2196
01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.060
<v Speaker 8>when you band people on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like you're like,</v>

2197
01:36:56.061 --> 01:36:57.770
<v Speaker 8>you are banned.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No blurry,</v>

2198
01:36:57.771 --> 01:36:58.790
<v Speaker 8>blocked,</v>
<v Speaker 8>blocked.</v>

2199
01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:04.180
<v Speaker 8>But sometimes I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like sometimes I'll just take some dumb </v>

2200
01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:04.180
<v Speaker 8>tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the Kim Kardashian road or something and</v>

2201
01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:07.250
<v Speaker 8>I'll say blog or irl,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2202
01:37:07.251 --> 01:37:12.251
<v Speaker 8>somebody will write something to me </v>
<v Speaker 8>that's actually kind of Nice and I'll </v>

2203
01:37:12.251 --> 01:37:12.251
<v Speaker 8>write block just to be silly and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 8>write to them and say,</v>

2204
01:37:12.251 --> 01:37:13.550
<v Speaker 8>I didn't really block you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just,</v>

2205
01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:15.830
<v Speaker 8>I just wanted to retweet what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But I also,</v>

2206
01:37:15.970 --> 01:37:20.970
<v Speaker 8>I don't like just retweet and </v>
<v Speaker 8>compliments and stuff because I just </v>

2207
01:37:20.970 --> 01:37:21.860
<v Speaker 8>think that that's true to compliment </v>
<v Speaker 8>than say blocked.</v>

2208
01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:25.670
<v Speaker 8>That's funny because then everybody gets</v>
<v Speaker 8>a lot out of it.</v>

2209
01:37:25.671 --> 01:37:26.090
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

2210
01:37:26.150 --> 01:37:28.430
<v Speaker 8>he's such an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That guy that said that nice thing,</v>

2211
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:33.790
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I just think that like there's just </v>

2212
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:33.790
<v Speaker 8>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 8>too many people that just want,</v>

2213
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:37.780
<v Speaker 8>they're all about getting retweets and </v>
<v Speaker 8>like begging for them and it's just </v>

2214
01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:38.440
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's kind of whacked.</v>

2215
01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:41.390
<v Speaker 8>The whole retweet thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I respond to people as much as I can,</v>

2216
01:37:41.391 --> 01:37:42.550
<v Speaker 8>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that is kind of whack.</v>

2217
01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:43.820
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're good with people though.</v>

2218
01:37:43.821 --> 01:37:48.821
<v Speaker 8>You like answer questions and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just get the same questions all the </v>

2219
01:37:48.821 --> 01:37:51.971
<v Speaker 8>time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People always ask me because I follow </v>

2220
01:37:51.971 --> 01:37:54.580
<v Speaker 8>for under 20 people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I thought that'd be funny thing on my </v>

2221
01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:55.560
<v Speaker 8>side,</v>
<v Speaker 8>on my page and it says I follow under 20</v>

2222
01:37:55.561 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 8>people,</v>

2223
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:59.190
<v Speaker 5>but then also that's like about how many</v>
<v Speaker 5>people I want to follow.</v>

2224
01:37:59.191 --> 01:38:04.191
<v Speaker 5>Like if there's somebody that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 5>interested in anymore and I want to add </v>

2225
01:38:04.191 --> 01:38:08.331
<v Speaker 5>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll drop somebody in ad I just keep it </v>

2226
01:38:08.331 --> 01:38:08.331
<v Speaker 5>in 20.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>

2227
01:38:08.331 --> 01:38:12.260
<v Speaker 5>Then a lot of people get it right away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't ask to be added because </v>

2228
01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:14.961
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to ruin your for 20 thing </v>

2229
01:38:14.961 --> 01:38:16.941
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'd love it if you added me or </v>

2230
01:38:16.941 --> 01:38:16.941
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but do.</v>

2231
01:38:16.941 --> 01:38:17.550
<v Speaker 5>Does anybody more connected to the pop </v>
<v Speaker 5>movement and you.</v>

2232
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:20.160
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not.</v>

2233
01:38:20.161 --> 01:38:22.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm not as political as people might </v>
<v Speaker 5>want me to be about it.</v>

2234
01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:25.110
<v Speaker 5>Although I've got some news for you </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>

2235
01:38:25.111 --> 01:38:27.660
<v Speaker 5>I'd love to share with your listeners </v>
<v Speaker 5>slash viewers.</v>

2236
01:38:27.661 --> 01:38:31.860
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In Missouri in 2012,</v>

2237
01:38:31.861 --> 01:38:34.950
<v Speaker 5>there's a chance of getting outright </v>
<v Speaker 5>legalization on the ballot.</v>

2238
01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:38.370
<v Speaker 5>Really skipping over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're skipping over the medical thing.</v>

2239
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:42.060
<v Speaker 5>They just need x number of signatures </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's not that many.</v>

2240
01:38:42.330 --> 01:38:47.330
<v Speaker 5>They just need a certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 5>signatures to get it to happen and they </v>

2241
01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:48.210
<v Speaker 5>need the signatures by May.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you're in Missouri,</v>

2242
01:38:48.211 --> 01:38:50.970
<v Speaker 5>get ahold of like your local normal </v>
<v Speaker 5>chapter,</v>

2243
01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:54.310
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nor nrml is,</v>

2244
01:38:54.410 --> 01:38:56.400
<v Speaker 5>that's how Brian's always spelled </v>
<v Speaker 5>normal.</v>

2245
01:38:56.401 --> 01:38:58.030
<v Speaker 5>How many and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2246
01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:03.040
<v Speaker 5>and just make sure you find out where </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can go because it's has to be </v>

2247
01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:05.751
<v Speaker 5>physical signatures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the most fucked up thing in </v>

2248
01:39:05.751 --> 01:39:08.331
<v Speaker 5>this computer age.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People should be able to sign petitions </v>

2249
01:39:08.331 --> 01:39:11.511
<v Speaker 5>now on their computer onlines and some </v>
<v Speaker 5>do like the Conservatives get lots of </v>

2250
01:39:11.511 --> 01:39:15.951
<v Speaker 5>good petitions going online,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for to get on the ballot for </v>

2251
01:39:15.951 --> 01:39:18.120
<v Speaker 5>legalization in Missouri,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I would love because there's a lot</v>

2252
01:39:18.121 --> 01:39:23.121
<v Speaker 5>of cities in Missouri that I like and if</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to go there and know that it was </v>

2253
01:39:23.121 --> 01:39:24.330
<v Speaker 5>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was so much fun.</v>

2254
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.690
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2255
01:39:24.691 --> 01:39:27.720
<v Speaker 5>marijuana is legal in Denver pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>

2256
01:39:27.721 --> 01:39:29.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They give you some sort of ticket.</v>

2257
01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:30.660
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't.</v>

2258
01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:33.010
<v Speaker 5>You're like blowing it on A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's one of those.</v>

2259
01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:37.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you're not supposed to be out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there publicly drinking,</v>

2260
01:39:37.621 --> 01:39:39.780
<v Speaker 5>just like you're not supposed to be out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there publicly smoking pot,</v>

2261
01:39:40.170 --> 01:39:43.080
<v Speaker 5>but then other people are pretty chill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2262
01:39:43.090 --> 01:39:48.090
<v Speaker 5>Then on stopping people at all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of cities and and you </v>

2263
01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:51.561
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's 16 states in Washington dc that </v>

2264
01:39:51.561 --> 01:39:52.920
<v Speaker 5>are our medical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then a lot of cities it's been,</v>

2265
01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:56.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of because I think it's,</v>

2266
01:39:56.890 --> 01:39:59.730
<v Speaker 5>it's been kind of quietly decriminalized</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of places,</v>

2267
01:39:59.790 --> 01:40:02.040
<v Speaker 5>a lot of those states though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really hard to get a license.</v>

2268
01:40:02.041 --> 01:40:03.580
<v Speaker 5>It's not as easy as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2269
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:08.750
<v Speaker 5>And it's really hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole dispensary system isn't in </v>

2270
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.750
<v Speaker 5>place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2271
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:13.340
<v Speaker 5>and that's the problem currently in </v>
<v Speaker 5>California is that the feds are again </v>

2272
01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:16.640
<v Speaker 5>threatening to cut two to basically </v>
<v Speaker 5>close down dispensary's and then the </v>

2273
01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:17.100
<v Speaker 5>question is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well where did the patients,</v>

2274
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:19.380
<v Speaker 5>because they've seen me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there seemed to be okay with patients at</v>

2275
01:40:19.381 --> 01:40:19.950
<v Speaker 5>this point.</v>

2276
01:40:20.190 --> 01:40:21.990
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're a medical marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 5>patient,</v>

2277
01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:25.350
<v Speaker 5>you should be able to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but where the patient's going to get it,</v>

2278
01:40:25.351 --> 01:40:30.351
<v Speaker 5>if they close down the dispensary </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're supposed to grow their </v>

2279
01:40:30.351 --> 01:40:33.231
<v Speaker 5>own or have some sort of concern from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the law enforcement is that there's a </v>

2280
01:40:34.201 --> 01:40:39.201
<v Speaker 5>lot of profit being made that is not </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be according to the way the </v>

2281
01:40:40.051 --> 01:40:41.350
<v Speaker 5>law is structured.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's there.</v>

2282
01:40:41.351 --> 01:40:44.010
<v Speaker 5>You're not supposed to be able to profit</v>
<v Speaker 5>as much as these people are profiting.</v>

2283
01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:49.400
<v Speaker 5>But the bottom line is that should be </v>
<v Speaker 5>the very last thing that law enforcement</v>

2284
01:40:50.941 --> 01:40:53.290
<v Speaker 5>is devoting its resources to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2285
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:54.840
<v Speaker 5>no one's getting hurt there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2286
01:40:55.020 --> 01:41:00.020
<v Speaker 5>so you're all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your attention should be devoted to </v>

2287
01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:03.481
<v Speaker 5>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All your attention should be devoted to </v>

2288
01:41:03.481 --> 01:41:03.850
<v Speaker 5>reckless drivers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Drunk drivers,</v>

2289
01:41:03.851 --> 01:41:05.560
<v Speaker 5>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 5>assault,</v>

2290
01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:08.740
<v Speaker 5>violent crime associated with marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 5>would go away.</v>

2291
01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:10.360
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

2292
01:41:10.361 --> 01:41:13.660
<v Speaker 5>just leave it alone and I swear </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything will be better.</v>

2293
01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:15.250
<v Speaker 5>It's really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2294
01:41:15.251 --> 01:41:16.930
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's other shit to concentrate on,</v>

2295
01:41:16.931 --> 01:41:21.820
<v Speaker 5>but I think also that in some cases </v>
<v Speaker 5>places need arrests.</v>

2296
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.220
<v Speaker 5>They need to make arrests and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking easy collar.</v>

2297
01:41:24.250 --> 01:41:29.250
<v Speaker 5>It's not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one's going to shoot you in your </v>

2298
01:41:29.250 --> 01:41:29.250
<v Speaker 5>closing down a pot store,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2299
01:41:29.250 --> 01:41:33.030
<v Speaker 5>you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you bring guys who are dressed like </v>

2300
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.030
<v Speaker 5>they're ready to go to war in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Afghanistan and they fucking go in there</v>

2301
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:36.040
<v Speaker 5>with machine guns and they clear </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything out and they take everything.</v>

2302
01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:37.960
<v Speaker 5>And it's crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2303
01:41:37.961 --> 01:41:38.800

<v Speaker 5>had blackwater uniforms on,</v>

<v Speaker 5>there were blackwater guys,</v>

2307
01:41:46.001 --> 01:41:51.001
<v Speaker 5>they hired mercenaries to go in there </v>
<v Speaker 5>and clean up and close down these pot </v>

2308
01:41:51.001 --> 01:41:51.160
<v Speaker 5>shops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

2309
01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:55.030
<v Speaker 5>because of the weirdest rates like in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you remember that though?</v>

<v Speaker 5>and one of the biggest laughs in the </v>

<v Speaker 5>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the unfortunately not me speaking.</v>

2314
01:42:06.191 --> 01:42:11.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a protest or advocate that's hanging </v>

2315
01:42:11.191 --> 01:42:13.381
<v Speaker 5>outside of place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's being rated a yells at the guys as </v>

2316
01:42:13.381 --> 01:42:17.641
<v Speaker 5>they're walking downstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have boxes full of marijuana and money </v>

<v Speaker 5>it's an easy color,</v>

2321
01:42:27.101 --> 01:42:28.930
<v Speaker 5>it's weak you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2322
01:42:29.170 --> 01:42:34.170
<v Speaker 5>it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm sure a lot of the guys that are </v>

2323
01:42:34.170 --> 01:42:35.080
<v Speaker 5>involved in doing those things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

2324
01:42:35.081 --> 01:42:36.910
<v Speaker 5>they're just following orders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just like,</v>

2325
01:42:36.970 --> 01:42:38.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's absolutely.</v>

2326
01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:39.340
<v Speaker 5>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get,</v>

2327
01:42:39.630 --> 01:42:42.340
<v Speaker 5>I guess people in law enforcement more </v>
<v Speaker 5>and more saying,</v>

2328
01:42:42.341 --> 01:42:47.341
<v Speaker 5>hey to me and winking at me and say I </v>
<v Speaker 5>like your work and stuff and kissing on </v>

2329
01:42:47.341 --> 01:42:48.340
<v Speaker 5>the lips.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of making out.</v>

2330
01:42:48.341 --> 01:42:49.690
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just will not.</v>

2331
01:42:50.150 --> 01:42:52.180
<v Speaker 5>I just draw the line at eating their </v>
<v Speaker 5>ass.</v>

2332
01:42:52.810 --> 01:42:53.800
<v Speaker 5>Don't try that line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bro.</v>

2333
01:42:54.610 --> 01:42:55.840
<v Speaker 5>Sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gotta try it.</v>

2334
01:42:55.841 --> 01:42:57.680
<v Speaker 5>I just think of assets as being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2335
01:42:57.681 --> 01:43:00.360
<v Speaker 5>I just said a very juvenile attitude </v>
<v Speaker 5>towards assets.</v>

2336
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:03.730
<v Speaker 5>Make them do a stripper shower before </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't want anything in my ass.</v>

2337
01:43:03.731 --> 01:43:05.440
<v Speaker 5>He even as Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>soft tongue.</v>

2338
01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:08.140
<v Speaker 5>I always say the cops don't get nearly </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough credit and there's a,</v>

2339
01:43:08.150 --> 01:43:10.750
<v Speaker 5>there's a divide between the citizens </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the police.</v>

2340
01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:12.670
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>

2341
01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:14.080
<v Speaker 5>They should be supported,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2342
01:43:14.110 --> 01:43:17.380
<v Speaker 5>and people support troops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But very few people support cops.</v>

2343
01:43:18.370 --> 01:43:21.460
<v Speaker 5>There's bad cops for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a small percentage.</v>

2344
01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:23.860
<v Speaker 5>We get to see how how good cops are </v>
<v Speaker 5>though,</v>

2345
01:43:23.861 --> 01:43:26.700
<v Speaker 5>because we're usually in situations </v>
<v Speaker 5>where it's,</v>

2346
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:28.610
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2347
01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:32.290
<v Speaker 5>especially you like wherever you see a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of law enforcement,</v>

2348
01:43:32.291 --> 01:43:37.291
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're sort of protecting you and you </v>

2349
01:43:37.291 --> 01:43:39.280
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just being out in public and stuff.</v>

2350
01:43:39.610 --> 01:43:44.610
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really have protected me when </v>

2351
01:43:44.610 --> 01:43:44.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm out in public.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When,</v>

2352
01:43:44.610 --> 01:43:44.770
<v Speaker 5>when they see you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

2353
01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.510
<v Speaker 5>you're a celebrity to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're like,</v>

2354
01:43:46.810 --> 01:43:48.820
<v Speaker 5>the last thing there cops are going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do is hassle you.</v>

2355
01:43:48.821 --> 01:43:49.990
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

2356
01:43:49.991 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 5>also when I pulled over when I wasn't</v>

2357
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.150
<v Speaker 3>a celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm polite.</v>

2358

<v Speaker 3>No Sir.</v>

2360

2363
01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:04.070
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten out of a few arrests </v>
<v Speaker 3>situations by just being polite.</v>

2364
01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:06.470
<v Speaker 3>Cup knows you're legitimately </v>
<v Speaker 3>respectful,</v>

2365
01:44:06.471 --> 01:44:07.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they appreciate that.</v>

2366
01:44:07.670 --> 01:44:08.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like man,</v>

2367
01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:10.460
<v Speaker 3>that's the fucking job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The job is.</v>

2368
01:44:10.461 --> 01:44:15.461
<v Speaker 3>We agree that guy gets the gun and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking flashing lights and you listen </v>

2369
01:44:15.461 --> 01:44:15.461
<v Speaker 3>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes sir.</v>

2370
01:44:15.461 --> 01:44:17.870
<v Speaker 3>No Sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that means you're a good citizen and</v>

2371
01:44:17.871 --> 01:44:19.340
<v Speaker 3>you're not trying to fucking cause any </v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>

2372
01:44:19.341 --> 01:44:20.820
<v Speaker 3>And in turn he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2373
01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:24.500
<v Speaker 3>take advantage of this power that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>presented to him by this willingness for</v>

2374
01:44:24.501 --> 01:44:27.170
<v Speaker 3>people to obey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he doesn't automatically assume that</v>

2375
01:44:27.171 --> 01:44:30.470
<v Speaker 3>everybody owes it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the problem with older cops.</v>

2376
01:44:30.471 --> 01:44:32.130
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem with these white </v>
<v Speaker 3>shirt concedes.</v>

2377
01:44:32.131 --> 01:44:34.490
<v Speaker 3>He punching people in these occupy Wall </v>
<v Speaker 3>Street crowds.</v>

2378
01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:36.770
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think they can punch people.</v>

2379
01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:37.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2380
01:44:37.261 --> 01:44:39.770
<v Speaker 3>there's ones and it's not all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a small fraction of it,</v>

2381
01:44:39.771 --> 01:44:41.360
<v Speaker 3>but they feel like they're better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2382
01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:43.130
<v Speaker 3>They feel like they've been older and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people around.</v>

2383
01:44:43.131 --> 01:44:46.370
<v Speaker 3>People who have been forced to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 3>them so long that they have a complex.</v>

2384
01:44:46.371 --> 01:44:51.371
<v Speaker 3>They've been involved in law enforcement</v>
<v Speaker 3>for 30 years and you have to fucking </v>

2385
01:44:51.371 --> 01:44:51.371
<v Speaker 3>listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2386
01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:53.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're going to get ultimate corruption.</v>

2389
01:44:57.411 --> 01:45:02.411
<v Speaker 3>We all know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even though you don't think of that </v>

2390
01:45:02.411 --> 01:45:02.411
<v Speaker 3>as corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has absolutely corruption.</v>

2391
01:45:02.411 --> 01:45:06.880
<v Speaker 3>When that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy white shirt and the video </v>

<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>

2394
01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Somebody told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that chick,</v>

2395

<v Speaker 3>Either way I say it's a chick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chick,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the play by play.</v>

2403
01:45:33.291 --> 01:45:38.291
<v Speaker 3>Like you're doing it for a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck taught him how to throw </v>

<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2407
01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:45.380
<v Speaker 3>the fact that he thought that he could </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

2408
01:45:45.381 --> 01:45:47.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what that person said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you calling you names and becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem and you have to arrest him,</v>

2414
01:45:58.271 --> 01:46:02.681
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the preponderance of a Taser incidents </v>

2415
01:46:02.681 --> 01:46:04.640
<v Speaker 3>and uses of tasers everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous.</v>

2416
01:46:04.641 --> 01:46:09.641
<v Speaker 3>Not just tasers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about the flash bombs they're </v>

2417
01:46:09.641 --> 01:46:09.641
<v Speaker 3>throwing on people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that shit?</v>

2418
01:46:09.641 --> 01:46:12.890
<v Speaker 3>That was a guy was a wounded vet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is disgusting.</v>

2419
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:15.500
<v Speaker 3>It's really disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like these cops are,</v>

2420
01:46:15.501 --> 01:46:20.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're forced everyday to go out there </v>

2421
01:46:20.501 --> 01:46:22.331
<v Speaker 3>and try to combat this ever growing </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that has shows no signs of </v>

2422
01:46:22.331 --> 01:46:24.320
<v Speaker 3>weakening in fact shows signs of gaining</v>
<v Speaker 3>momentum and strength.</v>

2423
01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:29.560
<v Speaker 3>And that's why all these movements are </v>
<v Speaker 3>being taken to try to squash it and try </v>

2424
01:46:29.601 --> 01:46:31.190
<v Speaker 3>to suppress it because they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2425
01:46:31.191 --> 01:46:34.070
<v Speaker 3>we got to stop this now because right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's 30,000</v>

2426
01:46:34.071 --> 01:46:36.410
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fuck do we do in it's 300,000</v>

2427
01:46:36.411 --> 01:46:37.730
<v Speaker 3>people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess what?</v>

2428
01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:39.260
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come through those </v>
<v Speaker 3>doors.</v>

2429
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Three hundred thousand people are going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to come through those doors and they're </v>

2430
01:46:44.350 --> 01:46:44.350
<v Speaker 3>gonna start throwing people out windows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2431
01:46:44.350 --> 01:46:45.750
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think they will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not violent.</v>

2432
01:46:45.751 --> 01:46:47.330
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't been a violent movement so </v>
<v Speaker 3>far,</v>

2433
01:46:47.331 --> 01:46:49.860
<v Speaker 3>but that's what they would do if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have 300,000</v>

2434
01:46:49.861 --> 01:46:50.310
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2435
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:51.990
<v Speaker 2>so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think of,</v>

2436
01:46:52.150 --> 01:46:54.600
<v Speaker 2>if you're like mayor Bloomberg or if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2437
01:46:54.601 --> 01:46:59.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on these fucking guys that owned some </v>

2438
01:46:59.601 --> 01:47:01.731
<v Speaker 2>giant Hedge Fund and you've made </v>
<v Speaker 2>billions of dollars is raping people </v>

2439
01:47:01.731 --> 01:47:03.480
<v Speaker 2>your whole life and then all the sudden </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2440
01:47:03.630 --> 01:47:07.560
<v Speaker 2>you picture what you would do if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were all those people,</v>

2441
01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:09.360
<v Speaker 2>you would think those people going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get me,</v>

2442
01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:11.400
<v Speaker 2>they're going to come again in a storm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gates,</v>

2443
01:47:11.490 --> 01:47:14.640
<v Speaker 2>even if they stay nonviolent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are never gonna accept that</v>

2444
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:19.790
<v Speaker 2>because they're always gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assume that human nature is always </v>

2445
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:21.951
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're going to push these people </v>

2446
01:47:21.951 --> 01:47:23.751
<v Speaker 2>back before it ever gets to a point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they can't control it and that's </v>

2447
01:47:23.751 --> 01:47:24.050
<v Speaker 2>why they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearing these fucking tense out.</v>

2448
01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:29.060
<v Speaker 2>That's where they're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they had an old library full of </v>

2449
01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:29.060
<v Speaker 2>books there too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they throw the books away.</v>

2450
01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:29.700
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

2451
01:47:29.730 --> 01:47:32.340

<v Speaker 2>That should be against the law.</v>

2452
01:47:32.370 --> 01:47:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right there.</v>

2453
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:37.590
<v Speaker 2>That should be a crime in this day of </v>
<v Speaker 2>age and age of ultimate retardation that</v>

2454
01:47:37.591 --> 01:47:42.591
<v Speaker 2>we find ourselves in when people are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking dope that you're throwing books </v>

2455
01:47:42.591 --> 01:47:43.470
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn Man.</v>

2456
01:47:43.530 --> 01:47:48.530
<v Speaker 2>You talk about someone who's not working</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the greater good of the people cop </v>

2457
01:47:48.530 --> 01:47:49.380
<v Speaker 2>that's throwing books away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2458
01:47:49.381 --> 01:47:54.381
<v Speaker 2>for the worst and all in the name of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposedly name of public safety.</v>

2459
01:47:57.730 --> 01:47:58.470
<v Speaker 2>So gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2460
01:47:58.471 --> 01:48:02.160
<v Speaker 2>you know that chase paid the cops four </v>
<v Speaker 2>point $6,000,000,</v>

2461
01:48:02.161 --> 01:48:04.620
<v Speaker 2>made a huge donation to the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

2462
01:48:04.710 --> 01:48:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that ridiculous?</v>

2463
01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:10.720
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything behind everything is is is </v>

2464
01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:13.070
<v Speaker 4>money now the money that these people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are going to try to defeat Obama,</v>

2465
01:48:13.071 --> 01:48:18.071
<v Speaker 4>the money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the millions and millions that they're </v>

2466
01:48:18.071 --> 01:48:20.190
<v Speaker 4>raising,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all it's going to is just trying </v>

2467
01:48:20.190 --> 01:48:21.890
<v Speaker 4>to win an election late.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a messed up system.</v>

2468
01:48:21.891 --> 01:48:26.891
<v Speaker 4>People are starving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those millions of dollars could feed </v>

2469
01:48:26.891 --> 01:48:29.060
<v Speaker 4>people and instead they're just putting </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody else in charge who's not who,</v>

2470
01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:30.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because Obama,</v>

2471
01:48:30.110 --> 01:48:33.800
<v Speaker 4>as much as he seems to try is </v>
<v Speaker 4>ineffective.</v>

2472
01:48:34.190 --> 01:48:36.200
<v Speaker 4>Everything's gonna be ineffective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoever,</v>

2473
01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:38.240
<v Speaker 4>if he loses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he wins,</v>

2474
01:48:38.370 --> 01:48:40.640
<v Speaker 4>if he wins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think is next for years can be kind of</v>

2475
01:48:40.641 --> 01:48:43.460
<v Speaker 4>interesting because he'll kind of have </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing to fucking lose.</v>

2476
01:48:43.660 --> 01:48:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Is that true though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

2477
01:48:45.161 --> 01:48:46.330
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2478
01:48:46.331 --> 01:48:51.331
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that anymore because I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't seen any evidence whatsoever </v>

2479
01:48:51.331 --> 01:48:51.490
<v Speaker 2>that he has any power at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2480
01:48:51.491 --> 01:48:53.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily believe it.</v>

2481
01:48:53.710 --> 01:48:58.710
<v Speaker 2>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole group of people that </v>

2482
01:48:58.710 --> 01:49:00.550
<v Speaker 2>have got him into position and once </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people sit down with them,</v>

2483
01:49:00.551 --> 01:49:05.551
<v Speaker 2>they explained to him what they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to get done and that's what gets </v>

2484
01:49:05.551 --> 01:49:08.551
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why Guantanamo Bay still </v>

2485
01:49:08.551 --> 01:49:08.551
<v Speaker 2>open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why</v>

2486
01:49:08.551 --> 01:49:08.710
<v Speaker 4>still slips through the cracks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's no,</v>

2487
01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:11.830
<v Speaker 4>there's no money interests that wanted </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get rid of.</v>

2488
01:49:11.831 --> 01:49:13.060
<v Speaker 4>Don't ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't tell.</v>

2489
01:49:13.061 --> 01:49:13.990
<v Speaker 4>And he made that happen.</v>

2490
01:49:14.130 --> 01:49:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a bone that he through people.</v>

2491
01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:19.200
<v Speaker 2>That's the bones go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty good.</v>

2492
01:49:19.201 --> 01:49:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

2493
01:49:20.141 --> 01:49:20.790
<v Speaker 2>That good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2494
01:49:20.791 --> 01:49:23.610
<v Speaker 2>You know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that gay people are to become</v>

2495
01:49:23.611 --> 01:49:25.260
<v Speaker 2>hired killers too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

2496
01:49:26.370 --> 01:49:28.390
<v Speaker 2>The fuck kind of advancement is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2497
01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:29.250
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2498
01:49:29.251 --> 01:49:30.190
<v Speaker 2>gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2499
01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:31.860
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that I'm and I'm,</v>

2500
01:49:31.861 --> 01:49:34.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm 100 percent not anti soldier </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>

2501
01:49:34.831 --> 01:49:39.831
<v Speaker 2>The show I am for the soldiers would I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>not for is the people that tell the </v>

2502
01:49:39.831 --> 01:49:42.030
<v Speaker 2>soldiers what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every fucking army needs soldiers.</v>

2503
01:49:42.031 --> 01:49:44.520
<v Speaker 2>Every nation needs an army because guess</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2504
01:49:44.521 --> 01:49:49.521
<v Speaker 2>Human nature is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of bad fucking people in </v>

2505
01:49:49.521 --> 01:49:52.741
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What makes me sick is when bad people </v>

2506
01:49:52.741 --> 01:49:53.800
<v Speaker 2>take good soldiers and make them do bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2507
01:49:54.010 --> 01:49:57.070
<v Speaker 2>and they do that for their own good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that I'm against soldiers.</v>

2508
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:59.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm 100 percent for soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers.</v>

2509
01:50:00.610 --> 01:50:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Those are people that understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm not for is the people that put </v>

2510
01:50:05.610 --> 01:50:08.881
<v Speaker 2>soldiers in situations where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers think they're doing the right </v>

2511
01:50:08.881 --> 01:50:10.000
<v Speaker 2>thing because they're following orders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think they're doing the right thing</v>

2512
01:50:10.001 --> 01:50:11.950
<v Speaker 2>because they're going after guys who </v>
<v Speaker 2>look like bad guys,</v>

2513
01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:15.040
<v Speaker 2>but the big question ever gets answered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing there in the</v>

2514
01:50:15.041 --> 01:50:17.500
<v Speaker 2>first place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you're doing the right thing.</v>

2515
01:50:17.501 --> 01:50:19.420
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you doing there in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first place?</v>

2516
01:50:19.670 --> 01:50:20.980
<v Speaker 2>You're going to stop another nine slash </v>
<v Speaker 2>11.</v>

2517
01:50:20.981 --> 01:50:22.450
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all dead.</v>

2518
01:50:22.451 --> 01:50:24.600
<v Speaker 2>The guys who did it are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how you stop it.</v>

2519
01:50:24.610 --> 01:50:25.510
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't let that happen,</v>

2520
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:28.960
<v Speaker 8>but I can get everybody over here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Fucking more soldiers.</v>

2521
01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.110
<v Speaker 8>The everybody watches this more </v>
<v Speaker 8>carefully.</v>

2522
01:50:31.130 --> 01:50:31.660
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>keep.</v>

2523
01:50:31.661 --> 01:50:33.490
<v Speaker 8>Keep America safe.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Soldiers.</v>

2524
01:50:33.491 --> 01:50:34.780
<v Speaker 8>The TSA employee</v>

2525
01:50:34.970 --> 01:50:39.970
<v Speaker 2>just keep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't deny the economic reasons for </v>

2526
01:50:39.970 --> 01:50:43.981
<v Speaker 2>going over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't deny it mean in the middle of </v>

2527
01:50:43.981 --> 01:50:46.561
<v Speaker 2>this peak oil crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's freaking out about what </v>

2528
01:50:46.561 --> 01:50:48.250
<v Speaker 2>happens when we run out of oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible to run out of oil?</v>

2529
01:50:48.251 --> 01:50:53.251
<v Speaker 2>What happens if the prices skyrocket to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the point where we get a massive </v>

2530
01:50:53.251 --> 01:50:55.720
<v Speaker 2>recession and so that's the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 2>we go over there.</v>

2531
01:50:55.721 --> 01:51:00.721
<v Speaker 2>We go over there to control the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we go over there because there's not </v>

2532
01:51:00.721 --> 01:51:00.721
<v Speaker 2>much left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2533
01:51:00.721 --> 01:51:01.240
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's really going on?</v>

2534
01:51:01.241 --> 01:51:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Let me know.</v>

2535
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:05.530
<v Speaker 8>You think that all this is leading up to</v>
<v Speaker 8>the protest.</v>

2536
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:07.970
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>getting the troops back here,</v>

2537
01:51:08.010 --> 01:51:13.010
<v Speaker 8>like all this is just gonna lead to </v>
<v Speaker 8>something like a new hands across </v>

2538
01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:16.531
<v Speaker 8>America and I knew we are the world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We already have to go through something </v>

2539
01:51:16.531 --> 01:51:16.531
<v Speaker 8>like that again.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Get already.</v>

2540
01:51:16.531 --> 01:51:20.821
<v Speaker 8>Is there your hands across America?</v>
<v Speaker 8>The only thing I'm worried about is the.</v>

2541
01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:24.760
<v Speaker 8>We are the world parodies that stand up </v>
<v Speaker 8>college would close their acts with.</v>

2542
01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:26.800
<v Speaker 8>That's what I'm worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 8>11 meaning,</v>

2543
01:51:26.810 --> 01:51:31.810
<v Speaker 8>you know the Kevin meaning I remember </v>
<v Speaker 8>hands across America but I don't </v>

2544
01:51:31.810 --> 01:51:36.721
<v Speaker 8>remember if I did it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I remember I don't think it worked </v>

2545
01:51:36.721 --> 01:51:36.721
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It didn't work.</v>

2546
01:51:36.721 --> 01:51:38.470
<v Speaker 8>It was fake and they just edited things </v>
<v Speaker 8>together.</v>

2547
01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:39.520
<v Speaker 8>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>wow,</v>

2548
01:51:39.521 --> 01:51:44.521
<v Speaker 8>look how far it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>All the way to the codes were </v>

2549
01:51:44.521 --> 01:51:44.521
<v Speaker 8>transferred from person to person.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That one,</v>

2550
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:48.010
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if I stood somewhere and </v>
<v Speaker 8>held hands with two people on the street</v>

2551
01:51:48.011 --> 01:51:48.910
<v Speaker 8>somewhere or not.</v>

2552
01:51:48.910 --> 01:51:51.310
<v Speaker 8>I think my uncle told me it was if I </v>
<v Speaker 8>didn't.</v>

2553
01:51:51.311 --> 01:51:53.470
<v Speaker 8>Well it's what we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 8>every seven years.</v>

2554
01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:55.930
<v Speaker 8>You get some shape files.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The Ellis sort.</v>

2555
01:51:56.020 --> 01:52:01.020
<v Speaker 8>That's been a while since that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think my hands across America </v>

2556
01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:03.550
<v Speaker 8>shouldn't have caused you that much </v>
<v Speaker 8>inconvenience,</v>

2557
01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:04.810
<v Speaker 8>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as an individual.</v>

2558
01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:06.090
<v Speaker 8>It's not that big a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Brian.</v>

2559
01:52:06.370 --> 01:52:11.370
<v Speaker 8>This is the worst fear that you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Fear of another we other world song.</v>

2560
01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:13.620
<v Speaker 8>That's so not what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What's going on here?</v>

2561
01:52:13.630 --> 01:52:16.060
<v Speaker 8>Some overthrow the government type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what's going on here.</v>

2562
01:52:16.061 --> 01:52:17.350
<v Speaker 8>And what's going on here is people </v>
<v Speaker 8>saying,</v>

2563
01:52:17.351 --> 01:52:18.340
<v Speaker 8>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this system right now,</v>

2564
01:52:18.341 --> 01:52:22.420
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't fucking work at all.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The only time in our life that I've ever</v>

2565
01:52:22.421 --> 01:52:27.421
<v Speaker 8>seen this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>never seen anything even remotely close </v>

2566
01:52:27.421 --> 01:52:27.421
<v Speaker 8>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Know every president,</v>

2567
01:52:27.421 --> 01:52:31.531
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in my lifetime has raised taxes at a </v>

2568
01:52:31.531 --> 01:52:33.400
<v Speaker 8>point where taxes need to be raised.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's never been this crazy.</v>

2569
01:52:34.150 --> 01:52:34.820
<v Speaker 8>It's never been this.</v>

2570
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:40.000
<v Speaker 2>There's never been this much discontent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never been giant protests all over </v>

2571
01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:40.910
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have occupied Toronto.</v>

2572
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.910
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2573
01:52:41.070 --> 01:52:42.450
<v Speaker 8>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Toronto is doing great.</v>

2574
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:44.250
<v Speaker 8>They're doing awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2575
01:52:44.251 --> 01:52:46.020
<v Speaker 8>it seems like they have a good economy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're,</v>

2576
01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:46.550
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2577
01:52:46.610 --> 01:52:48.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have nearly the problems with</v>

2578
01:52:48.261 --> 01:52:53.261
<v Speaker 3>unemployment that we have there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking doing pretty good up </v>

2579
01:52:53.261 --> 01:52:53.261
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot better than we're doing,</v>

2580
01:52:53.261 --> 01:52:54.200
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people are still like,</v>

2581
01:52:54.201 --> 01:52:55.370
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good enough.</v>

2582
01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:57.890
<v Speaker 3>Was it the 55,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people at Rogers Center?</v>

2583
01:52:57.891 --> 01:53:01.160
<v Speaker 3>Was that the most people at one UFC </v>
<v Speaker 3>event ever?</v>

2584
01:53:01.190 --> 01:53:02.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2585
01:53:02.210 --> 01:53:03.410
<v Speaker 3>That was epic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2586
01:53:03.411 --> 01:53:04.080
<v Speaker 3>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

2587
01:53:04.370 --> 01:53:07.970
<v Speaker 3>those tickets aren't cheap though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The record is actually being held by.</v>

2588
01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:09.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>

2589
01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:12.200
<v Speaker 3>I think in Japan they've had 90,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2590
01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2591
01:53:13.490 --> 01:53:16.080
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what the biggest they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever had.</v>

2592
01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:17.050
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't the UFC,</v>

2593
01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:19.130
<v Speaker 3>it was pride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pride events.</v>

2594
01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:25.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure during the peak of mixed</v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts they had something like </v>

2595
01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:25.260
<v Speaker 3>80,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>plus people,</v>

2596
01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:29.980
<v Speaker 3>which is really insane when you think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it because when we did the UFC it </v>

2597
01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:34.121
<v Speaker 3>was 55,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then they released an additional </v>

2598
01:53:34.121 --> 01:53:34.121
<v Speaker 3>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>seats and they sold them to.</v>

2599
01:53:34.190 --> 01:53:37.160
<v Speaker 3>So it turned out to be $60,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>

2600
01:53:37.161 --> 01:53:42.161
<v Speaker 3>they had to figure out how many seats </v>
<v Speaker 3>they could have and bringing all the </v>

2601
01:53:42.161 --> 01:53:42.800
<v Speaker 3>equipment because it was a completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>different show.</v>

2602
01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:47.920
<v Speaker 3>It was really stressful for everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it because they had these giant </v>

2603
01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:50.660
<v Speaker 3>fucking tvs everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everything is being shown on these 80</v>

2604
01:53:50.661 --> 01:53:53.630
<v Speaker 3>foot fucking tvs mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge place,</v>

2605
01:53:53.631 --> 01:53:54.950
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you could.</v>

2606
01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:57.770
<v Speaker 3>People were watching it from the hotel </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really wild.</v>

2607
01:53:57.950 --> 01:54:02.330
<v Speaker 3>The back of the Roger Center has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking hotel with windows wide open and</v>

2608
01:54:02.331 --> 01:54:07.331
<v Speaker 3>you could look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People had rooms where they could look </v>

2609
01:54:07.331 --> 01:54:07.331
<v Speaker 3>out their window and watched the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

2610
01:54:07.331 --> 01:54:08.900
<v Speaker 3>Fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even see that dude.</v>

2611
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:10.550
<v Speaker 3>It's the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That place is huge.</v>

2612
01:54:10.551 --> 01:54:11.990
<v Speaker 3>They played baseball in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2613
01:54:12.250 --> 01:54:14.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to wrap your head around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2614
01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:17.740
<v Speaker 3>is that the only place where um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2615
01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:21.460
<v Speaker 3>they gave us a earphones.</v>

2616
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:23.060
<v Speaker 3>They gave us these things that we put in</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

2617
01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:26.870
<v Speaker 3>in our ears to listen to you call the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the matches.</v>

2618
01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:28.700
<v Speaker 3>You can get those anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere.</v>

2619
01:54:29.070 --> 01:54:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the only place anybody's ever </v>

2620
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.070
<v Speaker 3>walked up to me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

2621
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.070
<v Speaker 3>do you want this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2622
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:35.660
<v Speaker 3>they were just giving them out to people</v>
<v Speaker 3>for some reason in Toronto.</v>

2623
01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:36.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2624
01:54:36.690 --> 01:54:41.690
<v Speaker 3>So I listened the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you should get it with your </v>

2625
01:54:41.690 --> 01:54:41.690
<v Speaker 3>ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2626
01:54:41.690 --> 01:54:42.030
<v Speaker 3>you're paying a fuck load for a ticket </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>

2627
01:54:42.031 --> 01:54:43.790
<v Speaker 3>They just hand them bitches out when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they get in the door.</v>

2628
01:54:43.791 --> 01:54:48.791
<v Speaker 3>That'd be a nice thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only 10 bucks and you can reuse it </v>

2629
01:54:48.791 --> 01:54:48.880
<v Speaker 3>at every UFC event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2630
01:54:49.090 --> 01:54:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2631
01:54:49.850 --> 01:54:54.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what ended up happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the one that I had because you </v>

2632
01:54:54.850 --> 01:54:54.850
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I smoke a lot of pot.</v>

2633
01:54:54.850 --> 01:54:56.050
<v Speaker 3>Smoke a lot of pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you?</v>

2634
01:54:56.070 --> 01:54:59.240
<v Speaker 3>Especially in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Toronto's awesome.</v>

2635
01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:02.380
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever do that pot club where you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2636
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:05.450
<v Speaker 3>you told me about it and then I did it </v>
<v Speaker 3>this next time I was there.</v>

2637
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:11.510
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't say the name because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know how easy it is to get in </v>

2638
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.880
<v Speaker 3>trouble for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it studies either.</v>

2639
01:55:11.890 --> 01:55:13.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're all pretty,</v>

2640
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:18.430
<v Speaker 3>pretty fucking chill there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure they have a vote really </v>

2641
01:55:18.430 --> 01:55:20.250
<v Speaker 3>soon on decriminalization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2642
01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:21.570
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2643
01:55:21.590 --> 01:55:25.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the exact specifics of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their situation with their law,</v>

2644
01:55:25.250 --> 01:55:28.040
<v Speaker 3>but it was deemed that the way the law </v>
<v Speaker 3>was written,</v>

2645
01:55:28.041 --> 01:55:30.770
<v Speaker 3>the cannabis laws were unconstitutional </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2646
01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:32.600
<v Speaker 3>they only had a certain amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 3>to fight that.</v>

2647
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:34.940
<v Speaker 3>And they're in the midst of it right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2648
01:55:34.941 --> 01:55:38.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it's going to be decided</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometime before the end of the year,</v>

2649
01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:40.580
<v Speaker 3>before the end of December.</v>

2650
01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:41.780
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>

2651
01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:42.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really interpret their,</v>

2652
01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:45.390
<v Speaker 3>their attitude towards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing up there.</v>

2653
01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:47.250
<v Speaker 3>As is NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just fucking,</v>

2654
01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:49.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC has medical now too.</v>

2655
01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:53.120
<v Speaker 3>If you have a California license you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to basically takes up.</v>

2656
01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:55.870
<v Speaker 3>I was just there for just for a night </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had,</v>

2657
01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:57.900
<v Speaker 3>I had a blast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love going to Canada.</v>

2658
01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:00.210
<v Speaker 3>So greatest city in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>

2659
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.860
<v Speaker 3>Canada's greatest city in our country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know the,</v>

2660
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:06.760
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest city in Canada is.</v>

2661
01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:08.070
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

2662
01:56:08.071 --> 01:56:09.120
<v Speaker 3>there's no bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2663
01:56:09.121 --> 01:56:11.190
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a tossup between Vancouver,</v>

2664
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:14.310
<v Speaker 3>like the most fun I've ever had between </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vancouver,</v>

2665
01:56:14.370 --> 01:56:15.750
<v Speaker 3>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Montreal.</v>

2666
01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Those are the three big cities that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>performed out.</v>

2667
01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.470
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's a toss up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2668
01:56:19.471 --> 01:56:21.250
<v Speaker 3>the only thing in Montreal you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2669
01:56:21.470 --> 01:56:26.470
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain amount of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't necessarily speak English that </v>

2670
01:56:26.470 --> 01:56:26.470
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2671
01:56:26.470 --> 01:56:27.180
<v Speaker 3>It's a little more French.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people are bilingual,</v>

2672
01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:29.130
<v Speaker 3>but there's a certain percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls,</v>

2673
01:56:29.490 --> 01:56:32.550
<v Speaker 3>but also that could effect a reaction a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>

2674
01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:35.310
<v Speaker 3>a little comedy because the language </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference,</v>

2675
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:39.970
<v Speaker 3>we get that a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a damn those girls are hot chocolate</v>

2676
01:56:40.010 --> 01:56:45.010
<v Speaker 3>with a French accent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when they're being horrible brawls </v>

2677
01:56:45.010 --> 01:56:45.480
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when they're being mean to you,</v>

2678
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:48.090
<v Speaker 3>what they have horrible bras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bras.</v>

2679
01:56:48.091 --> 01:56:53.091
<v Speaker 3>I've been with two of those French </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canadian girls and they both had really </v>

2680
01:56:53.091 --> 01:56:56.271
<v Speaker 3>creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that says more about girls who </v>

2681
01:56:56.271 --> 01:56:56.271
<v Speaker 3>want to fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love that.</v>

2682
01:56:56.271 --> 01:56:59.601
<v Speaker 3>I love that you're sampling to girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is a statement like that.</v>

2683
01:57:00.890 --> 01:57:04.190
<v Speaker 3>That's his gallery too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was with had terrible bras and did it.</v>

2684
01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:05.970
<v Speaker 3>You'd never know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Duke countries have like,</v>

2685
01:57:05.971 --> 01:57:08.670
<v Speaker 3>things like browser more important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like style wise,</v>

2686
01:57:08.671 --> 01:57:09.600
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like old,</v>

2687
01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:14.660
<v Speaker 3>old woman underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like is there a country want to stay </v>

2688
01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:15.260
<v Speaker 3>warm when you were there with chicks?</v>

2689
01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:20.260
<v Speaker 3>Wanted to stay warm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They throw less emphasis on sexy </v>

2690
01:57:20.260 --> 01:57:20.430
<v Speaker 3>underwear in Montreal and the winter </v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2691
01:57:20.490 --> 01:57:22.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh son and get cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2692
01:57:22.961 --> 01:57:23.370
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2693
01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:25.810
<v Speaker 3>used to do the old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2694
01:57:25.811 --> 01:57:28.680
<v Speaker 3>I should do Jimbo comedy works in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Montreal.</v>

2695
01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:30.990
<v Speaker 3>I still do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it last time I was there was a great</v>

2696
01:57:30.991 --> 01:57:33.030
<v Speaker 3>little small club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It only seats like 100 people.</v>

2697
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:38.270
<v Speaker 3>I should do it like way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way back in the day when I do the </v>

2698
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:38.270
<v Speaker 3>Montreal comedy festival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2699
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:42.321
<v Speaker 3>I walked from my hotel to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the club because it was only a few </v>

2700
01:57:42.321 --> 01:57:42.630
<v Speaker 3>blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all I got there every day is,</v>

2701
01:57:42.910 --> 01:57:46.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time ago and it was minus 15,</v>

2702
01:57:46.981 --> 01:57:48.840
<v Speaker 3>minus 16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was something like that.</v>

2703
01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:53.310
<v Speaker 3>And I walked to the club and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>ruthlessly painful dude.</v>

2704
01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:58.340
<v Speaker 3>It was ruthlessly painful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my ears felt like they're going to </v>

2705
01:57:58.340 --> 01:57:58.340
<v Speaker 3>fall off my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to have a wool hat,</v>

2706
01:57:58.500 --> 01:57:59.670
<v Speaker 3>like you had to have ear covers.</v>

2707
01:57:59.670 --> 01:58:02.040
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a looks thing like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to have,</v>

2708
01:58:02.610 --> 01:58:04.740
<v Speaker 3>should wear a ski mask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ski masks,</v>

2709
01:58:04.750 --> 01:58:08.460
<v Speaker 3>you should wear a ski mask because your </v>
<v Speaker 3>face gets ripped apart by the cold air.</v>

2710
01:58:08.850 --> 01:58:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that noise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fan of that.</v>

2711
01:58:12.241 --> 01:58:17.241
<v Speaker 3>So I guess we just officially decided </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vancouver's because in the wintertime </v>

2712
01:58:17.241 --> 01:58:19.620
<v Speaker 3>it's just got like Portland weather or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Seattle.</v>

2713
01:58:19.890 --> 01:58:24.890
<v Speaker 3>Vancouver is pretty fucking bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the cool people are as cool as </v>

2714
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:29.001
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is one of the most marijuana </v>

2715
01:58:29.001 --> 01:58:29.001
<v Speaker 3>influence cities in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2716
01:58:29.001 --> 01:58:30.540
<v Speaker 3>One of the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The movie that I was in the union,</v>

2717
01:58:30.541 --> 01:58:32.460
<v Speaker 3>the business of getting high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever watched that?</v>

2718
01:58:32.650 --> 01:58:33.390
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2719
01:58:33.420 --> 01:58:35.710
<v Speaker 3>my friend Adam scored,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did it and it's all about the,</v>

2720
01:58:35.730 --> 01:58:40.730
<v Speaker 3>the economy in Vancouver and how much of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is based around marijuana and how </v>

2721
01:58:40.730 --> 01:58:41.610
<v Speaker 3>insane it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2722
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:46.510
<v Speaker 3>the American laws and the horseshoe that</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes on with legalization.</v>

2723
01:58:46.510 --> 01:58:51.510
<v Speaker 3>But it's a great documentary on how </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous the whole scenario is.</v>

2724
01:58:52.361 --> 01:58:57.361
<v Speaker 3>The fact that it's illegal in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>place we should vaporize when we talk </v>

2725
01:58:57.361 --> 01:58:57.550
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think that things are ready to roll?</v>

2726
01:58:57.850 --> 01:59:02.500
<v Speaker 3>How long could it possibly take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's flashing red light flashing the</v>

2727
01:59:02.501 --> 01:59:07.501
<v Speaker 3>whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not supposed to be solid when it's </v>

2728
01:59:07.501 --> 01:59:10.501
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say the name of this </v>

2729
01:59:10.501 --> 01:59:11.611
<v Speaker 3>product because I don't want to give </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy a bad review because he seems </v>

2730
01:59:11.611 --> 01:59:11.611
<v Speaker 3>like a real nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't the red light you talking about?</v>

2731
01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:13.360
<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's try and see if it works.</v>

2732
01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Give it a shot</v>

2733
01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:17.850
<v Speaker 8>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2734
01:59:17.851 --> 01:59:21.630
<v Speaker 8>Tomorrow we have a death squad comedy </v>
<v Speaker 8>show at the Pasadena Ice House.</v>

2735
01:59:21.650 --> 01:59:25.050
<v Speaker 8>The dog will be there,</v>
<v Speaker 8>won't be doing a podcast beforehand.</v>

2736
01:59:25.051 --> 01:59:30.051
<v Speaker 8>So the podcast starts eight PM Pacific.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's going to be the same deal where </v>

2737
01:59:30.051 --> 01:59:34.611
<v Speaker 8>people can watch it live.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They can watch it live and we're going </v>

2738
01:59:34.611 --> 01:59:37.071
<v Speaker 8>to have a John Reap a little esther.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm Yoshi.</v>

<v Speaker 8>to get thc into my system.</v>

2752
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:21.600
<v Speaker 8>I had a lollipop in the car on the way </v>
<v Speaker 8>over here.</v>

2753
02:00:21.730 --> 02:00:24.240
<v Speaker 8>You animal fucking savage.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those are good.</v>

2754
02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:25.470
<v Speaker 8>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2755
02:00:25.471 --> 02:00:30.471
<v Speaker 8>and then people always have joints </v>
<v Speaker 8>around that you smoke and I'm not a </v>

2756
02:00:30.471 --> 02:00:31.110
<v Speaker 8>joint roller myself.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not a,</v>

2757
02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:36.120
<v Speaker 8>I don't have those skills.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I make apps so easy to make apples into </v>

2758
02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:37.710
<v Speaker 8>pipes whenever I'm in hotels because </v>
<v Speaker 8>they always have them in the lobby and.</v>

2759
02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:42.740
<v Speaker 8>But don't you feel like you're getting a</v>
<v Speaker 8>lot of the butane from the lighter in </v>

2760
02:00:42.740 --> 02:00:45.891
<v Speaker 8>your mouth?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Don't you taste that shit when you </v>

2761
02:00:45.891 --> 02:00:45.891
<v Speaker 8>inhale it through an apple?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Anytime you use anything?</v>

2762
02:00:45.891 --> 02:00:48.450
<v Speaker 8>We have to highlight the weed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We liked the weed over and over again.</v>

2763
02:00:48.530 --> 02:00:53.530
<v Speaker 8>You know that the joints is your light </v>
<v Speaker 8>at once and you could light it with a </v>

2764
02:00:53.530 --> 02:00:53.530
<v Speaker 8>match.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 8>That's a good point.</v>

2766
02:00:54.211 --> 02:00:58.680
<v Speaker 8>But I just like with joints it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 8>become more like a social thing for me.</v>

2767
02:00:58.710 --> 02:01:01.730
<v Speaker 8>Like I never just sit and smoke a joint </v>
<v Speaker 8>by myself and,</v>

2768
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:03.150
<v Speaker 8>and,</v>

<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

2774
02:01:13.951 --> 02:01:15.600

<v Speaker 8>polo.</v>

2775

<v Speaker 8>Little tiny joint.</v>

2782
02:01:34.341 --> 02:01:36.291

<v Speaker 8>smoke and vaporizer in my apartment and </v>

<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2787
02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:49.100
<v Speaker 8>like smoking game bonds will show you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>glitches in the Matrix.</v>

2788
02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:50.960
<v Speaker 8>Bongs,</v>

2794
02:02:02.211 --> 02:02:07.211
<v Speaker 8>just like the railroad and we made a </v>
<v Speaker 8>bong out of PCP that went from the first</v>

2798
02:02:17.211 --> 02:02:21.760
<v Speaker 8>It was like so huge and there was one </v>
<v Speaker 8>guy that could clear the whole thing,</v>

2799

2810
02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:03.461
<v Speaker 8>that the ATF was going to stop people </v>
<v Speaker 8>from getting new firearms if you were a </v>

2811
02:03:03.461 --> 02:03:04.700
<v Speaker 8>medical marijuana patient now you heard </v>
<v Speaker 8>this.</v>

2812

<v Speaker 8>Sounds pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It sounds nutty,</v>

2814
02:03:11.181 --> 02:03:16.181
<v Speaker 8>but it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't hit me at home because I </v>

2815
02:03:16.181 --> 02:03:16.181
<v Speaker 8>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2816
02:03:16.181 --> 02:03:17.420
<v Speaker 8>I'm not a firearms guy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2817
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:20.150
<v Speaker 8>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>For me,</v>

2818
02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:25.160
<v Speaker 8>I wish everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I wish everybody had guns was high </v>

2819
02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:29.200
<v Speaker 8>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You think more about your fellow man </v>

2820
02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:29.200
<v Speaker 8>before you pull the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's disgusting.</v>

2821
02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:30.290
<v Speaker 8>It's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like he don't like.</v>

2822
02:03:30.291 --> 02:03:35.291
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I hate that when people kind of paint </v>

2823
02:03:35.291 --> 02:03:35.291
<v Speaker 8>this idea that you could just that poc </v>
<v Speaker 8>and somehow,</v>

2824
02:03:35.291 --> 02:03:40.180
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I guess there's some people that can </v>

2825
02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:40.180
<v Speaker 8>make kind of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but for the most part it doesn't,</v>

2826
02:03:40.610 --> 02:03:43.090
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't make you have visions or do </v>
<v Speaker 8>things that you like,</v>

2827
02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:48.100
<v Speaker 8>like with alcohol where you do things </v>
<v Speaker 8>that you wouldn't do if you weren't </v>

2828
02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:48.100
<v Speaker 8>drunk.</v>

2829
02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:51.140
<v Speaker 8>There's weed doesn't really have that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean not full or something,</v>

2830
02:03:51.890 --> 02:03:53.900
<v Speaker 8>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like behind the wheel of a car,</v>

2831
02:03:53.901 --> 02:03:56.780
<v Speaker 8>how many people do you know or like when</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're high and driving,</v>

2832
02:03:56.810 --> 02:04:00.650
<v Speaker 8>they're maniacs in there and dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 8>and you know,</v>

2833
02:04:00.710 --> 02:04:04.220
<v Speaker 8>more of a threat than the old chart.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The cop pulls you over,</v>

2834
02:04:04.450 --> 02:04:06.620
<v Speaker 8>do you know why I pulled you over?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're going three miles an hour.</v>

2835
02:04:06.621 --> 02:04:09.410
<v Speaker 8>You're not parked.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But even then,</v>

2836
02:04:09.411 --> 02:04:11.230
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like every once in a while,</v>

2837
02:04:11.260 --> 02:04:13.730
<v Speaker 8>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've been trying to write down lately,</v>

2838
02:04:13.731 --> 02:04:16.130
<v Speaker 8>every time I do something stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 8>when I'm not high,</v>

2839
02:04:16.131 --> 02:04:16.770
<v Speaker 8>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm,</v>

2840
02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:18.830
<v Speaker 8>I'm not high like maybe an hour out of </v>
<v Speaker 8>every day.</v>

2841
02:04:18.831 --> 02:04:22.130
<v Speaker 8>So it's a small window because whether </v>
<v Speaker 8>you do your taxes.</v>

2842
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:24.560
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I could do my taxes high too.</v>

2843
02:04:24.561 --> 02:04:26.280
<v Speaker 8>I mean I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I now I have an account.</v>

2844
02:04:26.281 --> 02:04:27.500
<v Speaker 8>Doesn't freak you out though.</v>

2845
02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:29.030
<v Speaker 8>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you double check it,</v>

2846
02:04:29.031 --> 02:04:30.590
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like text to the,</v>

2847
02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:32.870
<v Speaker 8>when you're high and you're leaving a </v>
<v Speaker 8>hotel room,</v>

2848
02:04:32.871 --> 02:04:33.340
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>

2849
02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:38.380
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you pace around the room three or four </v>

2850
02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:40.661
<v Speaker 8>times to make sure you got all of items.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then one time out of five you left </v>

2851
02:04:40.661 --> 02:04:41.910
<v Speaker 8>something behind and you're just going </v>
<v Speaker 8>to have to buy it.</v>

2852
02:04:41.930 --> 02:04:46.930
<v Speaker 8>Check your pocket for $20 to buy a new </v>
<v Speaker 8>iphone adapter at the airport power </v>

2853
02:04:46.930 --> 02:04:51.500
<v Speaker 8>adapter.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I lose it every time I leave the </v>

2854
02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:51.500
<v Speaker 8>house more than $20.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those things.</v>

2855
02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:51.690
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're pricey.</v>

2856
02:04:51.700 --> 02:04:53.640
<v Speaker 8>They're like 100 bucks or they really.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2857
02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:56.260
<v Speaker 8>But what I did was I bought phone power </v>
<v Speaker 8>adapters.</v>

2858
02:04:56.270 --> 02:04:57.870
<v Speaker 8>A 100 bucks or no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2859
02:04:57.871 --> 02:04:59.510
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for the laptop,</v>

2860
02:04:59.540 --> 02:05:01.920
<v Speaker 8>for laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2861
02:05:01.921 --> 02:05:04.830
<v Speaker 8>those ones with the big white square.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

2862
02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:09.920
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but those things I know last a couple </v>

2863
02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:14.001
<v Speaker 8>over the years and then I just finally </v>
<v Speaker 8>got wise and bought two and I travel </v>

2864
02:05:14.230 --> 02:05:15.630
<v Speaker 8>with one and have one at home.</v>

2865
02:05:15.810 --> 02:05:16.950
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I do the same thing.</v>

2866
02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:20.340
<v Speaker 8>I have a laptop at least.</v>
<v Speaker 8>At least when I get back home,</v>

2867
02:05:20.341 --> 02:05:22.650
<v Speaker 8>it's there and I'm ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was so confused.</v>

2868
02:05:22.651 --> 02:05:24.140
<v Speaker 8>I thought you were just talking about </v>
<v Speaker 8>iphone adapters.</v>

2869
02:05:24.150 --> 02:05:25.570
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how the fuck are they charge 100 bucks.</v>

2870
02:05:26.730 --> 02:05:31.730
<v Speaker 8>30 bucks though.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Apple just released a recall on power </v>

2871
02:05:31.951 --> 02:05:35.280
<v Speaker 8>adapters and it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's about time they did something about</v>

2872
02:05:35.281 --> 02:05:40.281
<v Speaker 8>this because I've seen this on both my </v>
<v Speaker 8>power adapters for laptops and I phones </v>

2873
02:05:40.281 --> 02:05:42.720
<v Speaker 8>where the cord kind of comes out of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>plug.</v>

2874
02:05:42.721 --> 02:05:43.690
<v Speaker 8>Have you seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2875
02:05:43.730 --> 02:05:44.670
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2876
02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.350
<v Speaker 8>And so finally the recalling it right </v>
<v Speaker 8>now,</v>

2877
02:05:47.410 --> 02:05:48.790
<v Speaker 8>the new ones are much more sturdy</v>

2878
02:05:49.410 --> 02:05:51.080
<v Speaker 3>new ones though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like waste 30.</v>

2879
02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:52.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2880
02:05:52.251 --> 02:05:54.110
<v Speaker 3>Technology man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's adapting.</v>

2881
02:05:54.111 --> 02:05:55.640
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be the fucking bottleneck </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

2882
02:05:55.641 --> 02:05:57.980
<v Speaker 3>is battery life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real battle battery life.</v>

2883
02:05:58.380 --> 02:06:00.560
<v Speaker 3>You have to be connected to power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2884
02:06:00.590 --> 02:06:05.590
<v Speaker 3>real battery life was just not </v>
<v Speaker 3>substantial interest for power </v>

2885
02:06:05.590 --> 02:06:05.590
<v Speaker 3>everywhere now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2886
02:06:05.590 --> 02:06:10.460
<v Speaker 3>But the real question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will there ever be some sort of an </v>

2887
02:06:10.460 --> 02:06:14.681
<v Speaker 3>infinite battery source or some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>an amazing battery source where shit </v>

2888
02:06:14.681 --> 02:06:16.040
<v Speaker 3>last forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the print power,</v>

2889
02:06:17.190 --> 02:06:20.300
<v Speaker 3>how can you do that though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is something storing power?</v>

2890
02:06:20.420 --> 02:06:23.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would have to be like or something.</v>

2891
02:06:23.900 --> 02:06:25.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2892
02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:28.340
<v Speaker 3>But I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty cool with how it is.</v>

2893
02:06:28.341 --> 02:06:33.341
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get caught off guard by my </v>

2894
02:06:33.341 --> 02:06:33.341
<v Speaker 3>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2895
02:06:33.341 --> 02:06:33.341
<v Speaker 3>running out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2896
02:06:33.341 --> 02:06:33.341
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2897
02:06:33.341 --> 02:06:34.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm amazed that it works at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2898
02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:39.820
<v Speaker 3>the whole device is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially I know a lot of people I had </v>

2899
02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:40.970
<v Speaker 3>a conversation with is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very intelligent lady,</v>

2900
02:06:40.971 --> 02:06:45.971
<v Speaker 3>but she was talking to me about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>windows and she only uses windows and </v>

2901
02:06:45.971 --> 02:06:48.650
<v Speaker 3>the reason why she only uses windows is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because she doesn't like being told what</v>

2902
02:06:48.651 --> 02:06:50.360
<v Speaker 3>forum she buys her computers in.</v>

2903
02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:52.550
<v Speaker 3>She wants to be able to pick her own </v>
<v Speaker 3>parts and different,</v>

2904
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:56.390
<v Speaker 3>different things and I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the rational part of me goes,</v>

2905
02:06:56.391 --> 02:07:01.391
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but macs don't have viruses and they </v>

2906
02:07:01.391 --> 02:07:01.391
<v Speaker 3>work better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Done.</v>

2907
02:07:01.391 --> 02:07:01.600
<v Speaker 3>That conversation's over like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2908
02:07:01.610 --> 02:07:02.000
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2909
02:07:02.001 --> 02:07:07.001
<v Speaker 3>I would rather you know anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reason why they work so good is </v>

2910
02:07:07.001 --> 02:07:10.661
<v Speaker 3>because there's not a billion different </v>
<v Speaker 3>douche bags making these computers with </v>

2911
02:07:10.661 --> 02:07:11.830
<v Speaker 3>all these different parts and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2912
02:07:11.860 --> 02:07:16.860
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the operating system has to figure out </v>

2913
02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:17.090
<v Speaker 3>how the drivers to each individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>device work.</v>

2914
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:19.970
<v Speaker 8>I just think this is a shitty operating </v>
<v Speaker 8>system.</v>

2915
02:07:19.971 --> 02:07:22.060
<v Speaker 8>It used to be good and then they went to</v>
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

2916
02:07:22.061 --> 02:07:23.100
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>xp was,</v>

2917
02:07:23.210 --> 02:07:25.010
<v Speaker 8>what is it that now windows eight is it </v>
<v Speaker 8>seven,</v>

2918
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:28.130
<v Speaker 8>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 8>77 and I just think it's the Shitty,</v>

2919
02:07:28.190 --> 02:07:33.190
<v Speaker 8>like I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I like Osx and then when it comes to </v>

2920
02:07:33.190 --> 02:07:33.860
<v Speaker 8>most things you buy for your computer </v>
<v Speaker 8>nowadays,</v>

2921
02:07:33.950 --> 02:07:37.000
<v Speaker 8>everything's USB.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If it doesn't,</v>

2922
02:07:37.001 --> 02:07:40.260
<v Speaker 8>you don't have to have like what are you</v>
<v Speaker 8>really doing it?</v>

2923
02:07:40.610 --> 02:07:43.240
<v Speaker 8>If you didn't have a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 8>windows would be awesome.</v>

2924
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:46.540
<v Speaker 8>If somebody gave you a windows seven </v>
<v Speaker 8>computer in 1995,</v>

2925
02:07:46.541 --> 02:07:51.541
<v Speaker 8>you would have,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you would shoot a load all over your </v>

2926
02:07:51.541 --> 02:07:51.541
<v Speaker 8>keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You would be so excited,</v>

2927
02:07:51.541 --> 02:07:55.030
<v Speaker 8>but things have changed drastically at </v>
<v Speaker 8>one point.</v>

2928
02:07:55.090 --> 02:08:00.090
<v Speaker 8>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I remember I couldn't believe you </v>

2929
02:08:00.090 --> 02:08:03.211
<v Speaker 8>actually controlling that white line,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which I'm moving on screen and it's fun </v>

2930
02:08:03.211 --> 02:08:03.211
<v Speaker 8>to get good at it.</v>

2931
02:08:03.211 --> 02:08:04.180
<v Speaker 8>That was another one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was good at.</v>

2932
02:08:04.540 --> 02:08:05.330
<v Speaker 8>Pong.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2933
02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:10.340
<v Speaker 8>Real good at the one where you play,</v>
<v Speaker 8>where you play against the machine or </v>

2934
02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:10.340
<v Speaker 8>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2935
02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:13.870
<v Speaker 8>that was great.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That really freestone or days to.</v>

2936
02:08:13.871 --> 02:08:15.610
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That was the one I was really good at is</v>

2937
02:08:15.611 --> 02:08:18.820
<v Speaker 8>my parents used to go to a lay </v>
<v Speaker 8>priesthood days.</v>

2938
02:08:18.821 --> 02:08:22.630
<v Speaker 8>My parents used to go to a bar at a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>at a golf course.</v>

2939
02:08:22.631 --> 02:08:25.660
<v Speaker 8>There was also a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so they'd hang out there and you know,</v>

2940
02:08:25.661 --> 02:08:29.360
<v Speaker 8>they just bring me along or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And they had like that.</v>

2941
02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:34.680
<v Speaker 8>It was almost like my babysitter was </v>
<v Speaker 8>playing with the fucking pong machine </v>

2942
02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:35.880
<v Speaker 8>while my parents had some cocktails and </v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2943
02:08:36.070 --> 02:08:39.100
<v Speaker 8>I got so good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And also you used to be able to get free</v>

2944
02:08:39.101 --> 02:08:43.320
<v Speaker 8>games on pong by the metal thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>front that you,</v>

2945
02:08:43.370 --> 02:08:48.370
<v Speaker 8>that you put the quarters into the slot </v>
<v Speaker 8>if you rubbed your feet on the ground </v>

2946
02:08:48.370 --> 02:08:52.300
<v Speaker 8>and carpeting and built up static </v>
<v Speaker 8>electricity and then had like a piece of</v>

2947
02:08:52.301 --> 02:08:53.770
<v Speaker 8>metal in your hand like a quarter.</v>

2948
02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:57.640
<v Speaker 8>You could tap it just right and it would</v>
<v Speaker 8>throw a credits onto the.</v>

2949
02:08:57.641 --> 02:08:59.650
<v Speaker 8>Onto the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2950
02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:02.500
<v Speaker 8>I did it all the time or that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've like,</v>

2951
02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:04.390
<v Speaker 8>that is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>My life.</v>

2952
02:09:04.391 --> 02:09:09.391
<v Speaker 8>I've always found all these weird scams </v>
<v Speaker 8>that eventually like not only do they </v>

2953
02:09:09.391 --> 02:09:10.420
<v Speaker 8>not save you a whole lot in the first </v>
<v Speaker 8>place is twenty five cents,</v>

2954
02:09:10.421 --> 02:09:13.310
<v Speaker 8>but they also over time become,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2955
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:16.750
<v Speaker 8>become worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But it's weird little skills you pick up</v>

2956
02:09:16.751 --> 02:09:21.751
<v Speaker 8>just to just to cheat the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like the ski bus over and put it in the </v>

2957
02:09:21.751 --> 02:09:26.131
<v Speaker 8>50 and you just keep on getting those </v>
<v Speaker 8>tickets and put it into throwing it in </v>

2958
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:33.790
<v Speaker 8>their tickets to animal that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So many tickets that we hadn't.</v>

2959
02:09:36.341 --> 02:09:38.380
<v Speaker 8>Anything of value.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There was always like one,</v>

2960
02:09:38.381 --> 02:09:39.970
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like a beat box,</v>

2961
02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:41.220
<v Speaker 8>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2962
02:09:41.930 --> 02:09:45.610
<v Speaker 8>you can't help that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We'd call the day and yeah.</v>

2963
02:09:45.611 --> 02:09:48.010
<v Speaker 8>And you can't save up to get that many </v>
<v Speaker 8>tickets.</v>

2964
02:09:48.010 --> 02:09:53.010
<v Speaker 8>A million tickets for this one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You thinking about how much money you </v>

2965
02:09:53.010 --> 02:09:55.711
<v Speaker 8>spent,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how much time of your life has gone </v>

2966
02:09:55.711 --> 02:09:55.711
<v Speaker 8>rolling a stupid ball.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

2967
02:09:55.711 --> 02:09:59.941
<v Speaker 8>all the things I've done that take time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like the amount of time I've spent </v>

2968
02:09:59.941 --> 02:10:01.090
<v Speaker 8>playing poker,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the amount of time I spend watching dumb</v>

2969
02:10:01.091 --> 02:10:03.640
<v Speaker 8>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How you a road poker player.</v>

2970
02:10:03.641 --> 02:10:05.250
<v Speaker 8>Do you go to casinos when you do the </v>
<v Speaker 8>road?</v>

2971
02:10:05.251 --> 02:10:08.190
<v Speaker 8>That's what I'm in a gambling town or </v>
<v Speaker 8>like I don't,</v>

2972
02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:13.200
<v Speaker 8>I don't seek out casinos everywhere I go</v>
<v Speaker 8>because a lot of places have them now </v>

2973
02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:14.980
<v Speaker 8>because if Indian grounds or because </v>
<v Speaker 8>you're on a boat on the river.</v>

2974
02:10:15.370 --> 02:10:16.540
<v Speaker 8>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I only,</v>

2975
02:10:16.570 --> 02:10:20.470
<v Speaker 8>I only go if I'm playing the casino or </v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2976
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:25.790
<v Speaker 8>or I live across the street from it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's part of what I love about going </v>

2977
02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:29.010
<v Speaker 8>to see UFC in vegas is it gets me away </v>
<v Speaker 8>from the tables for like five hours </v>

2978
02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:29.950
<v Speaker 8>because.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2979
02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:31.930
<v Speaker 8>because I'll just sit and play and play </v>
<v Speaker 8>and play,</v>

2980
02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:32.830
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I love it,</v>

2981
02:10:32.930 --> 02:10:34.340
<v Speaker 8>but it's such a waste of time.</v>

2982
02:10:35.570 --> 02:10:38.330
<v Speaker 5>But also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it also at this point in my life,</v>

2983
02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:41.950
<v Speaker 5>the thrill of winning a hand isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>really the same because I don't,</v>

2984
02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:44.900
<v Speaker 5>I don't need the money as bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2985
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:47.270
<v Speaker 5>back when I was playing when I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2986
02:10:47.271 --> 02:10:52.271
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could pay for rent next month in his </v>

2987
02:10:52.271 --> 02:10:52.271
<v Speaker 5>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

2988
02:10:52.271 --> 02:10:53.270
<v Speaker 5>it was a lot more exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2989
02:10:53.271 --> 02:10:58.271
<v Speaker 5>Ari should fear would one point in time </v>
<v Speaker 5>was winning more money playing poker </v>

2990
02:10:58.271 --> 02:10:59.180
<v Speaker 5>than he was making it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing comedy for?</v>

2991
02:10:59.210 --> 02:11:04.210
<v Speaker 5>He's a good player.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I only played like we were the same </v>

2992
02:11:04.210 --> 02:11:04.550
<v Speaker 5>table in one tournament once I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

2993
02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:09.640
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to vibe off of him like he really </v>

2994
02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:12.461
<v Speaker 5>knows what he's doing because I still.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's still things that professional </v>

2995
02:11:12.461 --> 02:11:13.460
<v Speaker 5>poker players could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could teach me that I could,</v>

2996
02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:16.580
<v Speaker 5>I could stand to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm just too lazy to learn.</v>

2997
02:11:16.580 --> 02:11:19.550
<v Speaker 5>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the kinds of calculations you should</v>

2998
02:11:19.551 --> 02:11:23.870
<v Speaker 5>be making during each hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how exactly how much to bet and all</v>

2999
02:11:23.871 --> 02:11:25.490
<v Speaker 5>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just more like,</v>

3000
02:11:25.610 --> 02:11:27.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just goofing around.</v>

3001
02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:32.380
<v Speaker 5>He was just having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not trying to be the best poker </v>

3002
02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:32.380
<v Speaker 5>player in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3003
02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:33.110
<v Speaker 5>but I'm trying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to win through.</v>

3004
02:11:33.111 --> 02:11:35.210
<v Speaker 5>Just playing like an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can play chess.</v>

3005
02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:36.860
<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3006
02:11:36.861 --> 02:11:39.620
<v Speaker 5>when I was younger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't haven't in a long time.</v>

3007
02:11:40.010 --> 02:11:42.890
<v Speaker 5>That's a great obsession game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That game could drive people.</v>

3008
02:11:42.891 --> 02:11:44.630
<v Speaker 5>Deepened the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3009
02:11:44.631 --> 02:11:46.910
<v Speaker 5>You could spend a lot of time on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can go crazy.</v>

3010
02:11:46.911 --> 02:11:51.911
<v Speaker 5>You can really go mad and playing chess </v>
<v Speaker 5>because for certain people it absorbs </v>

3011
02:11:51.911 --> 02:11:53.000
<v Speaker 5>there everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there'll be walking down the street</v>

3012
02:11:53.001 --> 02:11:55.160
<v Speaker 5>and there'll be thinking about moves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it starts.</v>

3013
02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:57.050
<v Speaker 5>It starts getting to a point where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3014
02:11:57.230 --> 02:11:59.510
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see a direct result between the more</v>

3015
02:11:59.511 --> 02:12:02.130
<v Speaker 5>concentrated you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more you concentrate on it,</v>

3016
02:12:02.150 --> 02:12:07.150
<v Speaker 5>more that you focus on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more you start winning and the </v>

3017
02:12:07.150 --> 02:12:07.150
<v Speaker 5>better you get at playing chess and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just go.</v>

3018
02:12:07.150 --> 02:12:08.630
<v Speaker 5>You get lost,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you're crazy.</v>

3019
02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:09.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

3020
02:12:09.131 --> 02:12:14.131
<v Speaker 5>that's what I suggest doing poker is I </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't like sit there and evaluate how </v>

3021
02:12:14.131 --> 02:12:16.520
<v Speaker 5>everyone else is playing and what their </v>
<v Speaker 5>personalities are and like,</v>

3022
02:12:16.660 --> 02:12:21.660
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what he did on that hand and then what </v>

3023
02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:21.660
<v Speaker 5>he did on the next hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm just like more,</v>

3024
02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:23.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm just playing in the moment and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>know when,</v>

3025
02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:25.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know good cards when I see him or when</v>

3026
02:12:25.761 --> 02:12:27.050
<v Speaker 5>I have a good chance of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3027
02:12:27.260 --> 02:12:29.690
<v Speaker 5>drawing a winning hand and I just sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

3028
02:12:29.810 --> 02:12:30.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>play like that.</v>

3029
02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:33.710
<v Speaker 5>I did a movie once and the guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 5>renting out the house,</v>

3030
02:12:33.711 --> 02:12:34.490
<v Speaker 5>they rent out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3031
02:12:34.491 --> 02:12:36.860
<v Speaker 5>you want to shoot a movie in the house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can rent someone's house like people</v>

3032
02:12:36.861 --> 02:12:40.950
<v Speaker 5>offer them for rent and this guy was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>professional chess player and um,</v>

3033
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:43.110
<v Speaker 5>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of downtime during movie.</v>

3034
02:12:43.110 --> 02:12:45.050
<v Speaker 5>So I'd go hang out with this guy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk to them,</v>

3035
02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:49.160
<v Speaker 5>try to figure out what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was playing chess online,</v>

3036
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:50.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with all these different people.</v>

3037
02:12:50.871 --> 02:12:53.870
<v Speaker 5>And he was like some super fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>master chess player.</v>

3038
02:12:54.020 --> 02:12:59.020
<v Speaker 5>So it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was fascinating that he's got this </v>

3039
02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:00.890
<v Speaker 5>giant community of apparently you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>just get chess games like anytime of the</v>

3040
02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:02.060
<v Speaker 5>day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anytime of the night online,</v>

3041
02:13:02.061 --> 02:13:03.830
<v Speaker 5>whatever level you're at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3042
02:13:03.831 --> 02:13:06.140
<v Speaker 5>and there's people from all over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world that would play chess with,</v>

3043
02:13:06.141 --> 02:13:08.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>same thing with scrabble really.</v>

3044
02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:11.080
<v Speaker 5>People are fucking nuts with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>scrabble,</v>

3045
02:13:11.940 --> 02:13:15.500
<v Speaker 5>scrabble computer downwards with like </v>
<v Speaker 5>where they're playing against people all</v>

3046
02:13:15.501 --> 02:13:20.501
<v Speaker 5>over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you can see you can do it anytime </v>

3047
02:13:20.501 --> 02:13:20.990
<v Speaker 5>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's part of what I love about twitter</v>

3048
02:13:20.991 --> 02:13:25.991
<v Speaker 5>is if I am like up in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>night and not asleep for some reason </v>

3049
02:13:25.991 --> 02:13:26.480
<v Speaker 5>because I got to go to the airport or </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

3050
02:13:27.250 --> 02:13:29.970
<v Speaker 5>Can't sleep that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So great that like the,</v>

3051
02:13:30.090 --> 02:13:32.550
<v Speaker 5>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's international.</v>

3052
02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:34.890
<v Speaker 5>Once you get a certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 5>followers you can like,</v>

3053
02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:39.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure some people go on twitter and </v>

3054
02:13:39.950 --> 02:13:39.950
<v Speaker 5>they're pissed because they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3055
02:13:39.950 --> 02:13:43.750
<v Speaker 5>they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody that they follow saying anything </v>

3056
02:13:43.750 --> 02:13:44.010
<v Speaker 5>or write back to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it just.</v>

3057
02:13:44.011 --> 02:13:47.940
<v Speaker 5>So it's such,</v>
<v Speaker 5>such a 24 hour chat room source of.</v>

3058
02:13:48.490 --> 02:13:48.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3059
02:13:48.931 --> 02:13:51.570
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to chat with people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can just read what people are saying</v>

3060
02:13:51.571 --> 02:13:53.880
<v Speaker 5>and really choose what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>respond to.</v>

3061
02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:56.250
<v Speaker 5>The 24 hour aspect is really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're flying,</v>

3062
02:13:56.251 --> 02:14:00.030
<v Speaker 5>when you're in like in England or Europe</v>
<v Speaker 5>or something like that and times are all</v>

3063
02:14:00.031 --> 02:14:05.031
<v Speaker 5>screwed up and weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can constantly be tweeting and </v>

3064
02:14:05.031 --> 02:14:05.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you can kind of like,</v>

3065
02:14:05.341 --> 02:14:08.640
<v Speaker 5>it kind of replaces texting all your </v>
<v Speaker 5>friends about what you're doing.</v>

3066
02:14:08.970 --> 02:14:12.300
<v Speaker 5>You just send a tweet that's not going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to wake somebody up like you didn't want</v>

3067
02:14:12.301 --> 02:14:17.301
<v Speaker 5>to text.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm at Buckingham Palace and you </v>

3068
02:14:17.301 --> 02:14:20.131
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to sleep and the phone's </v>

3069
02:14:20.131 --> 02:14:20.131
<v Speaker 5>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3070
02:14:20.131 --> 02:14:22.730
<v Speaker 5>it's a good way to like I use it as like</v>
<v Speaker 5>a texting device when I think somebody </v>

3071
02:14:22.730 --> 02:14:25.320
<v Speaker 5>might not be awake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just write to them a direct message on</v>

3072
02:14:25.321 --> 02:14:28.560
<v Speaker 5>twitter instead of texting them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh do you really?</v>

3073
02:14:28.580 --> 02:14:30.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't check those enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3074
02:14:30.991 --> 02:14:35.991
<v Speaker 5>I know you're really slow to get back on</v>
<v Speaker 5>those sometimes for weeks and some </v>

3075
02:14:36.031 --> 02:14:36.690
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's funny,</v>

3076
02:14:36.691 --> 02:14:38.250
<v Speaker 5>when you write direct messages to </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

3077
02:14:38.251 --> 02:14:43.251
<v Speaker 5>sometimes they just don't even know that</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a thing that I did that with </v>

3078
02:14:43.251 --> 02:14:43.380
<v Speaker 5>voicemail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I don't ever listen to my voicemails</v>

3079
02:14:43.670 --> 02:14:45.600
<v Speaker 5>and it's probably the dumbest thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever,</v>

3080
02:14:45.601 --> 02:14:46.390
<v Speaker 5>but I just,</v>

3089
02:15:03.650 --> 02:15:06.540
<v Speaker 5>One Guy tweeted,</v>

3094
02:15:14.860 --> 02:15:19.860

3102
02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:31.620

02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:32.970
<v Speaker 5>say something to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for help the troops.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It was like really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like phonetically all fucked up and it </v>

3105
02:15:37.971 --> 02:15:39.390
<v Speaker 5>was all caps to see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to support the troops,</v>

3106
02:15:39.650 --> 02:15:42.030
<v Speaker 5>the explanation point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exclamation point one,</v>

3107
02:15:42.031 --> 02:15:42.600

<v Speaker 5>one.</v>

3108
02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:43.560
<v Speaker 5>And it was like it was.</v>

3109
02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:44.640
<v Speaker 5>And then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

02:15:44.641 --> 02:15:48.120
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck did I like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy expects me to reply is I have a</v>

3111
02:15:48.121 --> 02:15:49.670
<v Speaker 5>half a million twitter followers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

3112
02:15:49.710 --> 02:15:51.570
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I don't look at it all day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

3113
02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:53.220
<v Speaker 5>There's no way I could respond to </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>

3114
02:15:53.221 --> 02:15:54.450
<v Speaker 5>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

3115
02:15:54.570 --> 02:15:56.800
<v Speaker 5>So then I thought you're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every single person.</v>

3116
02:15:56.850 --> 02:15:57.870
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3117
02:15:57.871 --> 02:16:00.990
<v Speaker 5>So then I go to every single person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but quite a few,</v>

3118
02:16:01.020 --> 02:16:06.020
<v Speaker 5>I go to his twitter page and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same message he sent to literally </v>

3119
02:16:06.020 --> 02:16:07.860
<v Speaker 5>thousands of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just like,</v>

3120
02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:10.900
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3121
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:14.460
<v Speaker 5>in case you're wondering about their </v>
<v Speaker 5>personality or whatever,</v>

3122
02:16:14.461 --> 02:16:16.300
<v Speaker 5>you can go and see everything else </v>
<v Speaker 5>they've written.</v>

3123
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:21.310
<v Speaker 5>I love robot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably hate it when it's like if it's </v>

3124
02:16:21.310 --> 02:16:21.840
<v Speaker 5>at Benson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at Joe Rogan,</v>

3125
02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:23.670
<v Speaker 5>at red band,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some some shit.</v>

3126

<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3127
02:16:25.170 --> 02:16:26.390
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what happened.</v>

3128
02:16:26.850 --> 02:16:28.620
<v Speaker 5>That's what happens is it's fine when </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3129
02:16:28.621 --> 02:16:29.980

3130
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.290
<v Speaker 8>thrown in there like we all have common </v>
<v Speaker 8>interests,</v>

3131
02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:35.290
<v Speaker 8>but when somebody just throws in random,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3132
02:16:35.291 --> 02:16:36.340
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

<v Speaker 8>think we both need to know.</v>

3137

<v Speaker 8>like when it's just to me and Kim </v>

3138
02:16:56.370 --> 02:16:58.330

<v Speaker 8>news or whatever,</v>

3139
02:16:58.331 --> 02:17:01.220
<v Speaker 8>like some weird combination of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

3142
02:17:05.180 --> 02:17:08.080
<v Speaker 8>it's such a turnout.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It makes you want to just not respond to</v>

3143
02:17:08.081 --> 02:17:13.081
<v Speaker 8>them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then you go look at their page and </v>

3144
02:17:13.081 --> 02:17:13.870
<v Speaker 8>they're just randomly picking names and </v>
<v Speaker 8>that's how they do a lot of,</v>

3145
02:17:14.250 --> 02:17:17.270
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a lot of spam now on,</v>

3146
02:17:17.340 --> 02:17:19.530
<v Speaker 8>on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you,</v>

3147
02:17:19.710 --> 02:17:24.710
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as soon as you get a message us that </v>

3148
02:17:24.710 --> 02:17:26.761
<v Speaker 8>seems like an ad and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>then you check their page and they're </v>

3149
02:17:26.761 --> 02:17:26.761
<v Speaker 8>just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just sending that same thing.</v>

3150
02:17:26.761 --> 02:17:28.850
<v Speaker 8>I'm talking to my podcast.</v>

3151
02:17:29.310 --> 02:17:32.440
<v Speaker 2>So in the interest of brevity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got hacked like I,</v>

3152
02:17:32.470 --> 02:17:34.040
<v Speaker 2>I signed up for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3153
02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:39.380
<v Speaker 2>I must have clicked on some link to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>some twitter picture or something like </v>

3154
02:17:39.380 --> 02:17:41.370
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And somehow or another they tweeted from</v>

3155
02:17:41.371 --> 02:17:46.371
<v Speaker 2>my account about some contests for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ipad two and I was following them.</v>

3156
02:17:47.191 --> 02:17:48.570
<v Speaker 2>All of the sudden I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3157
02:17:48.571 --> 02:17:53.571
<v Speaker 2>this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they hacked into by twitter </v>

3158
02:17:53.571 --> 02:17:55.851
<v Speaker 2>account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You apparently it was probably some red </v>

3159
02:17:55.851 --> 02:17:55.851
<v Speaker 2>tape or some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3160
02:17:55.851 --> 02:17:56.280
<v Speaker 2>find print rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3161
02:17:56.340 --> 02:17:57.890
<v Speaker 2>when you agreed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3162
02:17:57.960 --> 02:17:59.440
<v Speaker 2>accept some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3163
02:17:59.490 --> 02:18:00.720
<v Speaker 2>some twitter application.</v>

3164
02:18:00.900 --> 02:18:04.330
<v Speaker 8>It happens everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Not Everyday,</v>

3165
02:18:04.350 --> 02:18:09.350
<v Speaker 8>but pretty frequently I'll see one of my</v>
<v Speaker 8>more famous friends or people had </v>

3166
02:18:09.350 --> 02:18:09.870
<v Speaker 8>followed just because I'm curious about </v>
<v Speaker 8>them,</v>

3167
02:18:09.930 --> 02:18:13.310
<v Speaker 8>that we still treat something odd or </v>
<v Speaker 8>something that sends,</v>

3168
02:18:13.330 --> 02:18:15.630
<v Speaker 8>seems like an ad.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then the next tweet is like,</v>

3169
02:18:15.631 --> 02:18:16.830
<v Speaker 8>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got hacked.</v>

3170
02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:22.160
<v Speaker 8>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>did you see when Ashton Kutcher was </v>

3171
02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:22.160
<v Speaker 8>tweeting?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh my gosh,</v>

3172
02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:23.100
<v Speaker 8>that was particularly about paternal </v>
<v Speaker 8>being fired.</v>

3173
02:18:23.540 --> 02:18:24.690
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because he did all.</v>

3174
02:18:24.691 --> 02:18:26.820
<v Speaker 8>He knew all he,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all he reacted to,</v>

3175
02:18:26.821 --> 02:18:28.680
<v Speaker 8>and I'm sure that's what a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 8>reacted to,</v>

3176
02:18:29.010 --> 02:18:34.010
<v Speaker 8>was just hearing that this amazing coach</v>
<v Speaker 8>got fired just very suddenly and he </v>

3177
02:18:35.971 --> 02:18:37.020
<v Speaker 8>didn't stop to think,</v>
<v Speaker 8>wow,</v>

3178
02:18:37.021 --> 02:18:42.021
<v Speaker 8>that big of a move.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like why would penn state following a </v>

3179
02:18:42.021 --> 02:18:43.560
<v Speaker 8>fire a guy?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So suddenly if something really terrible</v>

3180
02:18:43.561 --> 02:18:46.620
<v Speaker 8>didn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but he still went on and tweeted,</v>

3181
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:48.570
<v Speaker 8>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's a bummer.</v>

3182
02:18:48.570 --> 02:18:50.760
<v Speaker 8>Or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Or I love you,</v>

3183
02:18:50.761 --> 02:18:53.520
<v Speaker 8>Joe Pa.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3184
02:18:53.550 --> 02:18:54.930
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then the other guy,</v>

3185
02:18:55.020 --> 02:18:58.230
<v Speaker 8>but then he did Qa,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I guess kind of a good thing to spin it.</v>

3186
02:18:58.231 --> 02:19:03.231
<v Speaker 8>He respond.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He retweeted every person that wrote to </v>

3187
02:19:03.231 --> 02:19:06.321
<v Speaker 8>them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're an asshole urine idiot and you </v>

3188
02:19:06.321 --> 02:19:06.321
<v Speaker 8>just write in each one something like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

3189
02:19:06.321 --> 02:19:07.830
<v Speaker 8>I'm sorry I did.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just didn't know all the facts.</v>

3190
02:19:08.070 --> 02:19:10.700
<v Speaker 8>He sort of responded to a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 8>in show them,</v>

3191
02:19:11.010 --> 02:19:13.140
<v Speaker 8>showed a lot of the vitriol that was </v>
<v Speaker 8>happening.</v>

3192
02:19:13.350 --> 02:19:16.740
<v Speaker 8>You made a staff at Foxconn responded </v>
<v Speaker 8>to.</v>

3193
02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:22.100
<v Speaker 8>It seemed like something he really did.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was kind of the whole factory of </v>

3194
02:19:22.100 --> 02:19:25.371
<v Speaker 8>people responding to twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Imagine he is always Chinese workers,</v>

3195
02:19:26.170 --> 02:19:28.190
<v Speaker 8>like the ones they use in world of </v>
<v Speaker 8>warcraft</v>

3196
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:30.100
<v Speaker 5>to build up your energy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3197
02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:35.280
<v Speaker 5>they send your account overseas and some</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chinese guy plays with it until he </v>

3198
02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:36.050
<v Speaker 5>fucking starves to death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just copying machines,</v>

3199
02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:40.520
<v Speaker 5>body aside and throw some new student </v>
<v Speaker 5>onto the block too.</v>

3200
02:19:41.460 --> 02:19:44.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm not cynical enough to think that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ashton didn't do it himself because it.</v>

3201
02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:47.120
<v Speaker 5>Because it all happened in such real </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

3202
02:19:47.390 --> 02:19:49.100
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just had so many people.</v>

3203
02:19:49.110 --> 02:19:53.020
<v Speaker 5>Seems to me that when you're a celebrity</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's involved in a public scandal,</v>

3204
02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:58.080
<v Speaker 5>he has this most latest one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems interesting that he's tweeting </v>

3205
02:19:58.080 --> 02:19:58.970
<v Speaker 5>people at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3206
02:19:59.270 --> 02:20:01.220
<v Speaker 5>it's like you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would think if you're gonna,</v>

3207
02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:06.640
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna read any of the replies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know you're going to get a lot of </v>

3208
02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:10.601
<v Speaker 5>people that are going to ask you a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 5>of questions and you don't want to </v>

3209
02:20:10.601 --> 02:20:12.881
<v Speaker 5>answer like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you really want to just go out there </v>

3210
02:20:12.881 --> 02:20:12.881
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and interconnect with people,</v>

3211
02:20:12.881 --> 02:20:12.881
<v Speaker 5>but I guess he does it.</v>

3212
02:20:12.881 --> 02:20:14.600
<v Speaker 5>Spill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the amazing thing is it's like,</v>

3213
02:20:14.950 --> 02:20:16.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how important is it to get,</v>

3214
02:20:17.090 --> 02:20:20.440
<v Speaker 5>to try to feel like you're getting your </v>
<v Speaker 5>side of it out when,</v>

3215
02:20:20.441 --> 02:20:22.630
<v Speaker 5>when you think you're misunderstood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3216
02:20:22.631 --> 02:20:24.020
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and at a certain point in time,</v>

3217
02:20:24.021 --> 02:20:27.200
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the people's twitters become a </v>
<v Speaker 5>very impersonal,</v>

3218
02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:29.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the numbers get too big,</v>

3219
02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:34.120
<v Speaker 5>it seems like people take less chances.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The they say less than a million people </v>

3220
02:20:34.641 --> 02:20:37.320
<v Speaker 5>writing back to you that you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have used a certain slur.</v>

3221
02:20:37.380 --> 02:20:42.380
<v Speaker 5>Something when you were trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The joke was how inappropriate what you </v>

3222
02:20:42.380 --> 02:20:42.380
<v Speaker 5>were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3223
02:20:43.010 --> 02:20:45.200
<v Speaker 5>Like I'll sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I think it's something really dark,</v>

3224
02:20:45.201 --> 02:20:50.201
<v Speaker 5>I'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just drop it in the middle of the </v>

3225
02:20:50.201 --> 02:20:52.130
<v Speaker 5>night because a lot of stuff just gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of lost in the twitter verse,</v>

3226
02:20:52.131 --> 02:20:54.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like nobody's sitting.</v>

3227
02:20:54.021 --> 02:20:59.021
<v Speaker 5>Most people don't sit and read every </v>
<v Speaker 5>single thing written by every single </v>

3228
02:20:59.021 --> 02:20:59.021
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

3229
02:20:59.021 --> 02:21:01.310
<v Speaker 5>They follow that because a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>follow a thousand people.</v>

3230
02:21:01.410 --> 02:21:05.900
<v Speaker 5>So you're just in this kind of rushing </v>
<v Speaker 5>stream of comments and sometimes they'll</v>

3231
02:21:05.901 --> 02:21:10.901
<v Speaker 5>land on you because they know they like </v>
<v Speaker 5>you more than other people they follow </v>

3232
02:21:10.901 --> 02:21:11.660
<v Speaker 5>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But sometimes they'll also like anything</v>

3233
02:21:11.661 --> 02:21:13.610
<v Speaker 5>that looks like you're just promoting a </v>
<v Speaker 5>Gig,</v>

3234
02:21:13.611 --> 02:21:17.630
<v Speaker 5>they might just breeze past it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get every time I play a town,</v>

3235
02:21:17.780 --> 02:21:20.660
<v Speaker 5>like the day after on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone will write me,</v>

3236
02:21:20.661 --> 02:21:25.661
<v Speaker 5>when are you coming to?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's that town I was just in and it </v>

3237
02:21:25.661 --> 02:21:26.180
<v Speaker 5>just been tweeting about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's just,</v>

3238
02:21:26.181 --> 02:21:29.510
<v Speaker 5>you can't expect everybody to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

3239
02:21:29.580 --> 02:21:30.810
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3240
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:32.220
<v Speaker 5>think that you're going to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you,</v>

3241
02:21:32.221 --> 02:21:35.810
<v Speaker 5>you got to hope that your twitter is </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting enough that people are going</v>

3242
02:21:35.811 --> 02:21:37.400
<v Speaker 5>to lock onto it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3243
02:21:37.430 --> 02:21:42.430
<v Speaker 5>and you're going to hope that you build </v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a community there and then </v>

3244
02:21:42.430 --> 02:21:46.631
<v Speaker 5>they're going to be able to follow you </v>
<v Speaker 5>on your website or follow you at your </v>

3245
02:21:46.631 --> 02:21:47.770
<v Speaker 5>shows or look through your tweets to </v>
<v Speaker 5>find out where you're at or you know,</v>

3246
02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:50.030
<v Speaker 5>do you have a little schedule on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>twitter page?</v>

3247
02:21:50.060 --> 02:21:52.490
<v Speaker 5>So if you go to your twitter page,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can see what the upcoming dates are.</v>

3248
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:55.940
<v Speaker 5>They have a link to a site where I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>got all my dates,</v>

3249
02:21:55.941 --> 02:22:00.941
<v Speaker 5>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you guys think about this new </v>

3250
02:22:00.941 --> 02:22:00.941
<v Speaker 5>business they have on there with all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yet there's a word activity now in the </v>

3254
02:22:11.470 --> 02:22:14.051
<v Speaker 5>top of your page and if you click on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see just a list of everything that </v>

3255
02:22:14.121 --> 02:22:16.190
<v Speaker 5>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you follow what they're up to,</v>

3256
02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:18.110

<v Speaker 5>do you do that?</v>

3260

<v Speaker 5>because then because then you can,</v>

3261
02:22:29.611 --> 02:22:34.611

<v Speaker 5>it and it comes up that somebody just </v>

<v Speaker 5>Doug Benson?</v>

3268
02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:45.630
<v Speaker 5>It's 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the morning,</v>

3269
02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:46.740
<v Speaker 5>11 in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3270
02:22:46.741 --> 02:22:49.980
<v Speaker 5>here's the scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're alone stone to the gills.</v>

3271
02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:55.400
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you just like checking out twitter </v>

3272
02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:57.470
<v Speaker 5>and some really ridiculously hot suicide</v>
<v Speaker 5>girl with tattoos just starts following </v>

3273
02:23:00.241 --> 02:23:01.020
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3274
02:23:01.021 --> 02:23:02.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might write back and say,</v>

3275
02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:04.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3276
02:23:04.591 --> 02:23:07.120
<v Speaker 5>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or what's up?</v>

3277
02:23:07.230 --> 02:23:08.590
<v Speaker 5>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or whatever.</v>

3278
02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:09.780
<v Speaker 5>Just what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just reach,</v>

3279
02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:10.790
<v Speaker 5>reach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>reach out,</v>

3280
02:23:10.810 --> 02:23:12.360
<v Speaker 5>somebody to see what happens to a little</v>
<v Speaker 5>high,</v>

3281
02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:12.810
<v Speaker 5>just little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3282
02:23:12.811 --> 02:23:15.420
<v Speaker 5>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing incriminating button creeping.</v>

3283
02:23:15.580 --> 02:23:20.580
<v Speaker 5>And then often what we'll come back is I</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't direct message you because you </v>

3284
02:23:20.580 --> 02:23:24.411
<v Speaker 5>don't follow me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And my next direct message says the </v>

3285
02:23:24.411 --> 02:23:26.010
<v Speaker 5>system works and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you,</v>

3286
02:23:26.040 --> 02:23:28.980
<v Speaker 5>you see how different people handle it.</v>

3287
02:23:28.980 --> 02:23:33.980
<v Speaker 5>Different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people will get pissed off right </v>

3288
02:23:33.980 --> 02:23:33.980
<v Speaker 5>away and don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3289
02:23:33.980 --> 02:23:36.831
<v Speaker 5>don't want to deal with somebody where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're half of the conversation is </v>

3290
02:23:36.831 --> 02:23:36.831
<v Speaker 5>public,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but your half is,</v>

3291
02:23:36.831 --> 02:23:39.690
<v Speaker 5>is private.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

3292
02:23:39.691 --> 02:23:40.950
<v Speaker 5>what else am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3293
02:23:40.951 --> 02:23:43.350
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not on twitter to have conversations</v>

3294
02:23:43.351 --> 02:23:46.890
<v Speaker 5>with other people in front of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of my followers because.</v>

3295
02:23:46.970 --> 02:23:49.830
<v Speaker 5>So why don't you just fucking with them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not interesting to read.</v>

3296
02:23:50.060 --> 02:23:52.410
<v Speaker 5>Just follow them for a little while and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then unfold.</v>

3297
02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:56.220
<v Speaker 5>You can do that for 20 number,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no.</v>

3298
02:23:56.221 --> 02:24:00.060
<v Speaker 5>Then I really will play a game where if </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's somebody that I want to follow,</v>

3299
02:24:00.061 --> 02:24:04.530
<v Speaker 5>I will add them and then go through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>list and see who's going to go.</v>

3300
02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:08.670
<v Speaker 5>It's usually somebody that I followed </v>
<v Speaker 5>that just ultimately is their tweets.</v>

3301
02:24:08.671 --> 02:24:10.320
<v Speaker 5>Haven't been that interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

3302
02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:10.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3303
02:24:10.951 --> 02:24:13.960
<v Speaker 5>I followed some crazy super famous </v>
<v Speaker 5>people just because I,</v>

3304
02:24:14.010 --> 02:24:16.830
<v Speaker 5>I think it could be interesting and some</v>
<v Speaker 5>I cling to like I,</v>

3305
02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:19.050
<v Speaker 5>I love following Alec Baldwin.</v>

3306
02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:21.840
<v Speaker 5>I think he's really entertaining and </v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3307
02:24:21.841 --> 02:24:24.340
<v Speaker 5>and I don't follow them out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I gave up my,</v>

3308
02:24:24.450 --> 02:24:29.450
<v Speaker 5>her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I followed her for a while and then </v>

3309
02:24:29.450 --> 02:24:29.450
<v Speaker 5>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I stopped a long time ago.</v>

3310
02:24:29.450 --> 02:24:34.360
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because he just tweets a lot and for </v>

3311
02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:36.420
<v Speaker 5>awhile there it was just a lot of back </v>
<v Speaker 5>and forth with Demi Moore and that was </v>

3312
02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:36.420
<v Speaker 5>just kinda like they were being way too </v>
<v Speaker 5>cute.</v>

3313
02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:38.730
<v Speaker 5>Like the whole time you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this relationship is not going to last.</v>

3314
02:24:38.731 --> 02:24:41.040
<v Speaker 5>They're putting way too much effort into</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretending,</v>

3315
02:24:41.310 --> 02:24:46.310
<v Speaker 5>not pretending,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe actually being in love with each </v>

3316
02:24:46.310 --> 02:24:46.310
<v Speaker 5>other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they just won't shut up about it.</v>

3317
02:24:46.310 --> 02:24:49.290
<v Speaker 5>How can you maintain that is a couple </v>
<v Speaker 5>PDA on twitter's growth.</v>

3318
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:52.920
<v Speaker 5>What if she's a lesbian and he's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>her beard?</v>

3319
02:24:54.220 --> 02:24:55.740
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3320
02:24:55.741 --> 02:24:58.880
<v Speaker 5>I think they probably fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had turned sex where?</v>

3321
02:24:58.890 --> 02:25:00.280
<v Speaker 5>Like the creepy weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

3322
02:25:00.370 --> 02:25:03.930
<v Speaker 5>I came in and looked ashen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his asshole and stuff like that.</v>

3323
02:25:04.110 --> 02:25:06.210
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just ruined everything.</v>

3324
02:25:06.740 --> 02:25:10.890
<v Speaker 5>It ruined everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know he's mad at Ashton now.</v>

3325
02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:14.040
<v Speaker 5>Ashton supposedly having affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3326
02:25:14.060 --> 02:25:16.650
<v Speaker 5>so now they don't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uncle Bruce is going to kick them out.</v>

3327
02:25:16.830 --> 02:25:18.900
<v Speaker 5>But that's the funny thing that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3328
02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:22.510
<v Speaker 5>for TV viewers instantly forgive the </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole thing about him having affairs,</v>

3329
02:25:22.650 --> 02:25:24.040
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3330
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:29.070
<v Speaker 4>that show the ratings might have come </v>
<v Speaker 4>down a little bit from the jumping out </v>

3331
02:25:29.070 --> 02:25:30.100
<v Speaker 4>in favor of Joe Papa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really at the wrong moment,</v>

3332
02:25:30.580 --> 02:25:31.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

3333
02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:36.580
<v Speaker 4>that's what's amazing to me about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole Penn state story is just that.</v>

3334
02:25:36.581 --> 02:25:37.570
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>

3335
02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:40.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only one notch above the worst thing.</v>

3336
02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:43.460
<v Speaker 4>The worst thing a person could do </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably right there,</v>

3337
02:25:44.370 --> 02:25:49.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't even want to think about </v>

3338
02:25:49.370 --> 02:25:49.370
<v Speaker 4>what's below it and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

3339
02:25:49.370 --> 02:25:53.671
<v Speaker 4>and so everyone's disgusted by it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some are still managed to be some </v>

3340
02:25:53.671 --> 02:25:54.880
<v Speaker 4>people that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are just,</v>

3341
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:58.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>defending in some weird way,</v>

3342
02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:04.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that were involved in the </v>

3343
02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:04.920
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3344
02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:04.920
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3345
02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:07.570
<v Speaker 4>I was saying how weird it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy's name was officer or Macquarie,</v>

3346
02:26:07.750 --> 02:26:08.560
<v Speaker 4>the guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3347
02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:11.020
<v Speaker 4>found them in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the hotel room together,</v>

3348
02:26:11.021 --> 02:26:16.021
<v Speaker 4>which did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that whole thing now is just falling </v>

3349
02:26:16.021 --> 02:26:16.021
<v Speaker 4>apart.</v>

3350
02:26:16.021 --> 02:26:16.570
<v Speaker 4>His story's not matching what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what supposedly happened at the time.</v>

3351
02:26:16.571 --> 02:26:17.650
<v Speaker 4>And which guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Macquarie.</v>

3352
02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:19.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's saying now that he went,</v>

3353
02:26:19.150 --> 02:26:22.630
<v Speaker 4>he did go to police officers and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they and they proceeded to,</v>

3354
02:26:22.950 --> 02:26:27.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not follow through because initially </v>

3355
02:26:27.950 --> 02:26:31.060
<v Speaker 4>he's just sick of getting all this shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>about people saying that he just went to</v>

3356
02:26:31.061 --> 02:26:34.840
<v Speaker 4>Joe Pa and he didn't go to the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he now he's saying he did,</v>

3357
02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:37.060
<v Speaker 4>but he testified,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3358
02:26:37.061 --> 02:26:39.070
<v Speaker 4>because this guy has gone through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3359
02:26:39.250 --> 02:26:44.250
<v Speaker 4>people had to testify for and against </v>
<v Speaker 4>San Dusky before on it earlier charges,</v>

3360
02:26:45.370 --> 02:26:50.370
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so at that time it supposedly the </v>

3361
02:26:50.370 --> 02:26:53.680
<v Speaker 4>report was that he didn't speak to any </v>
<v Speaker 4>cops and now he's saying he did.</v>

3362
02:26:54.010 --> 02:26:55.340
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3363
02:26:55.610 --> 02:27:00.310
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>horrifying stories that we may never end</v>

3364
02:27:00.311 --> 02:27:02.920
<v Speaker 4>in our lifetimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It may just go on and on and on,</v>

3365
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:07.810
<v Speaker 4>just because getting to the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that happened.</v>

3366
02:27:08.290 --> 02:27:13.290
<v Speaker 4>Like I heard someone tell someone else </v>
<v Speaker 4>the theory that then I heard that is </v>

3367
02:27:14.831 --> 02:27:17.680
<v Speaker 4>just absolutely mortifying that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3368
02:27:17.681 --> 02:27:22.681
<v Speaker 4>this guy saying Dusky worked with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>children's charity and those were the </v>

3369
02:27:22.681 --> 02:27:26.161
<v Speaker 4>kids he was bringing to the Games and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they show pictures of him like </v>

3370
02:27:26.161 --> 02:27:27.490
<v Speaker 4>leaning on these kids and they got </v>
<v Speaker 4>little foothill football helmets on and,</v>

3371
02:27:27.970 --> 02:27:32.970
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy that he was showering with </v>

3372
02:27:32.970 --> 02:27:32.970
<v Speaker 4>them at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the kids and the end him.</v>

3373
02:27:32.970 --> 02:27:34.330
<v Speaker 4>Neither one of them are playing in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>

3374
02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:36.730
<v Speaker 4>So why do they even need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

3375
02:27:36.970 --> 02:27:39.360
<v Speaker 4>What's the pretense for being in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>showers?</v>

3376
02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:41.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like right there,</v>

3377
02:27:41.261 --> 02:27:43.990
<v Speaker 4>the guy's guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could he be,</v>

3378
02:27:43.991 --> 02:27:45.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I don't care if you put.</v>

3379
02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:49.120
<v Speaker 4>If he actually had sex with him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just setting up that scenario,</v>

3380
02:27:49.121 --> 02:27:51.250
<v Speaker 4>makes them a creep that shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed to do that.</v>

3381
02:27:51.690 --> 02:27:55.780
<v Speaker 4>And with kids with these disinfect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these kids that are poor and you know,</v>

3382
02:27:55.781 --> 02:27:58.450
<v Speaker 4>and from foster homes or whatever the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3383
02:27:58.451 --> 02:27:59.980
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this charity,</v>

3384
02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:02.780
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got these extra vulnerable kids and</v>

3385
02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:06.970
<v Speaker 4>he's doing these things too and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably being taken to a football game.</v>

3386
02:28:06.971 --> 02:28:09.070
<v Speaker 4>It's the most amazing thing that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened to them.</v>

3387
02:28:09.220 --> 02:28:13.810
<v Speaker 4>And they also don't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand the implications of what he's</v>

3388
02:28:13.811 --> 02:28:18.010
<v Speaker 4>doing to them when he physically attacks</v>
<v Speaker 4>them or those photos real of his house.</v>

3389
02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:23.040
<v Speaker 4>Like being in the same like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the backyard of an elementary </v>

3390
02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:23.040
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just seen</v>

3391
02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:26.160
<v Speaker 5>that I bought surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it just like an elementary school</v>

3392
02:28:26.161 --> 02:28:28.670
<v Speaker 5>and a little bit of woods and then a </v>
<v Speaker 5>house and then supposedly,</v>

3393
02:28:28.671 --> 02:28:31.670
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it was just a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but supposedly that's his house.</v>

3394
02:28:31.700 --> 02:28:33.260
<v Speaker 5>Like on the other side of this little </v>
<v Speaker 5>woods,</v>

3395
02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:38.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking like that woods is probably</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that scene in like human centipede </v>

3396
02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:41.831
<v Speaker 5>word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they go and find this house in the </v>

3397
02:28:41.831 --> 02:28:41.831
<v Speaker 5>middle of the other side of the woods </v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's like a creepy guy that lives</v>

3398
02:28:41.831 --> 02:28:43.970
<v Speaker 5>in there and molests kids I come to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3399
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:48.990
<v Speaker 5>you probably like sneaks through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>forest and spies on kids at the </v>

3400
02:28:48.990 --> 02:28:50.510
<v Speaker 5>elementary school and it's just like </v>
<v Speaker 5>this creepy rape force.</v>

3401
02:28:50.810 --> 02:28:55.810
<v Speaker 5>We all just start talking and just go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hilarious when you're fucking high </v>

3402
02:28:56.030 --> 02:29:01.030
<v Speaker 5>and just start talking about something </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I never even got to my point </v>

3403
02:29:01.030 --> 02:29:01.220
<v Speaker 5>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was that,</v>

3404
02:29:01.820 --> 02:29:06.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of rich people that also </v>

3405
02:29:06.820 --> 02:29:07.070
<v Speaker 5>pumped money into this charity because </v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy told them to.</v>

3406
02:29:07.070 --> 02:29:12.070
<v Speaker 5>And so this one law enforcement officer </v>
<v Speaker 5>who I think probably has a good idea </v>

3407
02:29:12.070 --> 02:29:16.031
<v Speaker 5>about these things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>suggested the notion that this guy was </v>

3408
02:29:16.031 --> 02:29:18.680
<v Speaker 5>grooming kids for boosters to fool </v>
<v Speaker 5>around with.</v>

3409
02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:21.560
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there was a whole ring.</v>

3410
02:29:21.740 --> 02:29:22.850
<v Speaker 5>He had a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3411
02:29:22.851 --> 02:29:25.150
<v Speaker 5>Like he had like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had a whole system like that.</v>

3412
02:29:25.151 --> 02:29:26.780
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a possibility.</v>

3413
02:29:26.990 --> 02:29:31.990
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like this thing is going to get so </v>

3414
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.600
<v Speaker 5>twisted and deep as used.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Horrifying.</v>

3415
02:29:33.950 --> 02:29:38.950
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing that he got away with it as</v>
<v Speaker 5>long as he did and the only way he got </v>

3416
02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:38.960
<v Speaker 5>away with it for 19 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 years,</v>

3417
02:29:38.961 --> 02:29:43.961
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is if people knew and didn't say </v>

3418
02:29:43.961 --> 02:29:43.961
<v Speaker 5>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>

3419
02:29:43.961 --> 02:29:47.020
<v Speaker 5>It was the institution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the everyone afraid of losing </v>

3420
02:29:47.020 --> 02:29:47.030
<v Speaker 5>their jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>losing the game,</v>

3421
02:29:47.031 --> 02:29:48.160
<v Speaker 5>losing their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3422
02:29:48.220 --> 02:29:49.340
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3423
02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:51.980
<v Speaker 5>everything is so important to them.</v>

3424
02:29:52.130 --> 02:29:54.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean they rioted when he got fired,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you saw the riots,</v>

3425
02:29:54.921 --> 02:29:56.480
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying,</v>

3426
02:29:56.760 --> 02:30:01.760
<v Speaker 5>they were Ashton Kutcher,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ashton Kutcher would've flipped a car </v>

3427
02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:03.950
<v Speaker 5>over if he was there because the story </v>
<v Speaker 5>just got quickly,</v>

3428
02:30:03.951 --> 02:30:08.951
<v Speaker 5>more and more horrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they just reacted immediately that </v>

3429
02:30:08.951 --> 02:30:08.951
<v Speaker 5>he was fired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3430
02:30:08.951 --> 02:30:09.710
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as soon as he was like,</v>

3431
02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:12.830
<v Speaker 5>well also how horrible for him to come </v>
<v Speaker 5>out and say,</v>

3432
02:30:12.831 --> 02:30:17.831
<v Speaker 5>this is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to finish out the season and </v>

3433
02:30:17.831 --> 02:30:18.590
<v Speaker 5>then retire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like his first move should have been.</v>

3434
02:30:18.591 --> 02:30:21.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I went to retire and I fucked up,</v>

3435
02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:24.440
<v Speaker 5>but saying I'm going to finish out the </v>
<v Speaker 5>season.</v>

3436
02:30:25.070 --> 02:30:30.070
<v Speaker 5>That gave everyone like this hope that </v>
<v Speaker 5>like they were going to have a great </v>

3437
02:30:30.070 --> 02:30:32.000
<v Speaker 5>championship season and then worry about</v>
<v Speaker 5>this later,</v>

3438
02:30:32.330 --> 02:30:34.130
<v Speaker 5>and so then when they turned around and </v>
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

3439
02:30:34.340 --> 02:30:39.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he ended up being fired or resigned or </v>

3440
02:30:39.340 --> 02:30:39.340
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>however went down,</v>

3441
02:30:39.340 --> 02:30:39.860
<v Speaker 5>that's when they started flipping shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>over.</v>

3442
02:30:40.310 --> 02:30:42.650
<v Speaker 5>This story was in a book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be two.</v>

3443
02:30:42.651 --> 02:30:44.180
<v Speaker 5>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd be like,</v>

3444
02:30:44.181 --> 02:30:47.360
<v Speaker 5>this is too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not like a Stephen King Book.</v>

3445
02:30:47.420 --> 02:30:48.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't.</v>

3446
02:30:48.021 --> 02:30:48.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

3447
02:30:48.531 --> 02:30:49.430
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really is.</v>

3448
02:30:49.460 --> 02:30:54.460
<v Speaker 5>Really is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would think there's no way that can </v>

3449
02:30:54.460 --> 02:30:56.561
<v Speaker 5>happen for this long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no way I could go on for 20 </v>

3450
02:30:56.561 --> 02:30:59.291
<v Speaker 5>years and he could just keep getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>away with it and keep mining these </v>

3451
02:30:59.291 --> 02:31:03.010
<v Speaker 5>children to have such shame and </v>
<v Speaker 5>confusion by the incident that they </v>

3452
02:31:03.010 --> 02:31:05.150
<v Speaker 5>never tell anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many guys,</v>

3453
02:31:05.240 --> 02:31:06.450
<v Speaker 5>how many kids?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Always kids.</v>

3454
02:31:06.451 --> 02:31:11.451
<v Speaker 5>It's also kids like most of this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>happens with kids that are familiar </v>

3455
02:31:11.451 --> 02:31:12.620
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're the person that attacks them.</v>

3456
02:31:12.621 --> 02:31:17.621
<v Speaker 5>It's never.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's rarely an abject stranger who gets </v>

3457
02:31:17.621 --> 02:31:17.880
<v Speaker 5>in their life and quickly done something</v>
<v Speaker 5>horrible.</v>

3458
02:31:18.080 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 5>We actually spent a good deal of time</v>

3459
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:21.690
<v Speaker 2>talking about this in the podcast last </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

3460
02:31:21.810 --> 02:31:24.530
<v Speaker 2>About how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or last time about how um,</v>

3461
02:31:24.900 --> 02:31:29.900
<v Speaker 2>there were some emails back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 2>from some priests were they actually </v>

3462
02:31:29.900 --> 02:31:32.130
<v Speaker 2>talked about getting boys from troubled </v>
<v Speaker 2>homes,</v>

3463
02:31:32.370 --> 02:31:34.860
<v Speaker 2>getting boys who don't have good </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections to their family.</v>

3464
02:31:34.861 --> 02:31:36.680
<v Speaker 2>They don't have anyone to count on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get them.</v>

3465
02:31:37.510 --> 02:31:41.490
<v Speaker 2>They go after them and grown them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some dark shit,</v>

3466
02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:41.880
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3467
02:31:43.230 --> 02:31:45.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is Sanduski guy's just,</v>

3468
02:31:45.490 --> 02:31:49.710
<v Speaker 5>it's just not a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we were making fun of earlier his,</v>

3469
02:31:49.740 --> 02:31:52.800
<v Speaker 5>his side of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking to Bob Costas,</v>

3470
02:31:53.040 --> 02:31:58.040
<v Speaker 5>particularly scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bob Cast is so good at those interviews </v>

3471
02:31:58.040 --> 02:31:58.160
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

3472
02:31:58.290 --> 02:32:00.840
<v Speaker 5>why were you in this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why did you need to shower at all?</v>

3473
02:32:00.860 --> 02:32:02.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a good question.</v>

3474
02:32:02.340 --> 02:32:04.380
<v Speaker 5>Asking that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>

3475
02:32:04.830 --> 02:32:05.910
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think everybody,</v>

3476
02:32:05.940 --> 02:32:07.950
<v Speaker 5>but he did press him pretty hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did.</v>

3477
02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:10.560
<v Speaker 5>I think everybody assumes that guy fucks</v>
<v Speaker 5>kids.</v>

3478
02:32:10.680 --> 02:32:15.680
<v Speaker 5>I think everybody's assuming that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they have to be careful in how they </v>

3479
02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:17.160
<v Speaker 5>proceed with questioning him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

3480
02:32:17.161 --> 02:32:20.730
<v Speaker 5>But the thing that he did that he did </v>
<v Speaker 5>this tea,</v>

3481
02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:23.880
<v Speaker 5>this radio interview to spin the court </v>
<v Speaker 5>of public opinion,</v>

3482
02:32:23.900 --> 02:32:25.250
<v Speaker 5>that's ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3483
02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:27.660
<v Speaker 5>but I think it just made it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll way,</v>

3484
02:32:27.661 --> 02:32:28.080
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

3485
02:32:28.081 --> 02:32:29.640
<v Speaker 5>way worse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way worse because he was.</v>

3486
02:32:29.660 --> 02:32:34.660
<v Speaker 5>Because he went into it with the Hubris </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the confidence of thinking that as </v>

3487
02:32:34.660 --> 02:32:36.960
<v Speaker 5>long as I just go in there and denied,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least some people might believe me.</v>

3488
02:32:37.470 --> 02:32:42.470
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then saying just being such a creep </v>

3489
02:32:42.470 --> 02:32:44.040
<v Speaker 5>and saying like being around children </v>
<v Speaker 5>now the answer is no.</v>

3490
02:32:44.041 --> 02:32:46.890
<v Speaker 5>I would never do that to a child.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the answer.</v>

3491
02:32:47.110 --> 02:32:49.500
<v Speaker 5>It's in their parents that are going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>try to murder him.</v>

3492
02:32:49.501 --> 02:32:51.290
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3493
02:32:51.330 --> 02:32:56.330
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing that I think not only </v>

3494
02:32:56.330 --> 02:32:58.941
<v Speaker 5>is the media outside his house now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that like that's another crazy </v>

3495
02:32:58.941 --> 02:32:59.690
<v Speaker 5>thing letting him go on bales.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ridiculous.</v>

3496
02:33:00.010 --> 02:33:02.130
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean certainly in jail,</v>

3497
02:33:02.131 --> 02:33:04.170
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they cheat child predators</v>
<v Speaker 5>very well.</v>

3498
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:07.740
<v Speaker 5>They to isolate doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isolate them in a jail,</v>

3499
02:33:07.741 --> 02:33:09.330
<v Speaker 5>like letting him go on bail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

3500
02:33:09.331 --> 02:33:11.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't get that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that guy's going to ice himself.</v>

3501
02:33:11.790 --> 02:33:16.790
<v Speaker 5>He might ice himself or get out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>access to kids in showers have to be </v>

3502
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:20.211
<v Speaker 5>limited at least to a couple of hours a </v>
<v Speaker 5>week or something like that says you </v>

3503
02:33:20.211 --> 02:33:25.040
<v Speaker 5>can't do it daily because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened to him the first time where I </v>

3504
02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:25.650
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They took away as key to the showers.</v>

3505
02:33:25.860 --> 02:33:30.860
<v Speaker 5>What they took away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got such a school did because the </v>

3506
02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:31.680
<v Speaker 5>first time it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they believed him.</v>

3507
02:33:31.681 --> 02:33:33.210
<v Speaker 5>When he said he was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just horseplay.</v>

3508
02:33:33.211 --> 02:33:38.211
<v Speaker 5>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it was hot and he had to only do hot </v>

3509
02:33:38.211 --> 02:33:38.211
<v Speaker 5>dog hot tubs after that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

3510
02:33:38.250 --> 02:33:39.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where's it defined?</v>

3511
02:33:39.571 --> 02:33:41.550
<v Speaker 5>A new venue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It takes them to hotel rooms.</v>

3512
02:33:41.551 --> 02:33:46.551
<v Speaker 5>That's what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who brought kids with them on the road </v>

3513
02:33:46.551 --> 02:33:46.551
<v Speaker 5>there were staying with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

3514
02:33:46.551 --> 02:33:50.160
<v Speaker 5>It's such an amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Such an amazing cover.</v>

3515
02:33:50.161 --> 02:33:55.161
<v Speaker 5>Like I always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always joke around on stage about how </v>

3516
02:33:55.161 --> 02:33:58.010
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't it be funny if I did all I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>done to create this idea that I'm a pod </v>

3517
02:33:58.010 --> 02:34:00.810
<v Speaker 5>comic and it turns out I am a cop and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that all my shows,</v>

3518
02:34:00.811 --> 02:34:05.811
<v Speaker 5>everybody gets arrested like a giant </v>
<v Speaker 5>sting operation.</v>

3519
02:34:08.350 --> 02:34:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Other people in the pot movement it </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably undercover cops you think?</v>

3520
02:34:11.710 --> 02:34:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was one that died in a motorcycle </v>

3521
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.710
<v Speaker 2>accident and he would uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet at this.</v>

3522
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:18.010
<v Speaker 2>It was like a normal chapter.</v>

3523
02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:19.930
<v Speaker 5>One of those groups,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3524
02:34:20.140 --> 02:34:21.490
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was uh,</v>

3525
02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:26.510
<v Speaker 5>a local guy and he was in this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this group and I died in a motorcycle </v>

3526
02:34:26.510 --> 02:34:31.411
<v Speaker 5>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It turned out he was a cop and he was </v>

3527
02:34:31.411 --> 02:34:32.140
<v Speaker 5>undercover the entire time or maybe just</v>
<v Speaker 5>enjoying himself.</v>

3528
02:34:32.350 --> 02:34:34.150
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that was his job.</v>

3529
02:34:34.151 --> 02:34:37.390
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what it came to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kids that don't smoke course,</v>

3530
02:34:37.990 --> 02:34:41.110
<v Speaker 5>which is an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like those people are like saints to me.</v>

3531
02:34:41.111 --> 02:34:43.930
<v Speaker 5>Like why go to all this trouble or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that you're not doing,</v>

3532
02:34:43.931 --> 02:34:45.850
<v Speaker 5>but they see the big picture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3533
02:34:45.851 --> 02:34:50.851
<v Speaker 5>It's a freedom issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The main issue is why would anybody be </v>

3534
02:34:50.851 --> 02:34:54.451
<v Speaker 5>able to tell you what you can't do and </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone telling you that you can't get </v>

3535
02:34:54.451 --> 02:34:54.820
<v Speaker 5>high is absolutely nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

3536
02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.100
<v Speaker 5>It's like if you were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always say if you're on an island with</v>

3537
02:34:57.101 --> 02:34:59.650
<v Speaker 5>two people and one person said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen man,</v>

3538
02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:00.580
<v Speaker 5>I don't want you getting high.</v>

3539
02:35:00.580 --> 02:35:02.380
<v Speaker 5>You get high,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to put you in a cage.</v>

3540
02:35:03.270 --> 02:35:05.390
<v Speaker 5>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to have to kill this guy going</v>

3541
02:35:05.470 --> 02:35:07.150
<v Speaker 5>to lock me in a fucking cage if I get </v>
<v Speaker 5>high.</v>

3542
02:35:07.180 --> 02:35:09.820
<v Speaker 5>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell that I want to do.</v>

3543
02:35:09.821 --> 02:35:14.821
<v Speaker 5>Like if they said you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you can't have sex with a </v>

3544
02:35:14.821 --> 02:35:15.100
<v Speaker 5>cantaloupe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if there was four people,</v>

3545
02:35:15.101 --> 02:35:17.890
<v Speaker 5>and I mean it's just as ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If there's a 4 million people,</v>

3546
02:35:17.891 --> 02:35:22.891
<v Speaker 5>it's just as ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous for one person to tell </v>

3547
02:35:22.891 --> 02:35:25.921
<v Speaker 5>you what you can and can't do with your </v>
<v Speaker 5>bond and it's not gonna affect other </v>

3548
02:35:25.921 --> 02:35:28.351
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not an issue where you're ruining </v>

3549
02:35:28.351 --> 02:35:28.351
<v Speaker 5>the fucking environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not an issue with her.</v>

3550
02:35:28.351 --> 02:35:32.280
<v Speaker 5>You're damaging the civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not doing anything while you're </v>

3551
02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:32.680
<v Speaker 5>doing it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you're doing it wrong.</v>

3552
02:35:33.070 --> 02:35:34.530
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

<v Speaker 5>have a lot of windows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3563
02:36:00.271 --> 02:36:00.271
<v Speaker 5>so it still looks like a nightclub or </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

3564
02:36:00.271 --> 02:36:03.520
<v Speaker 5>You've still got the same vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've had really good time because,</v>

<v Speaker 5>that I visit all the time and never see </v>

3569
02:36:16.621 --> 02:36:17.410
<v Speaker 5>because I'm in the stupid comedy club </v>
<v Speaker 5>all night.</v>

3570
02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:21.270
<v Speaker 5>Not to say that that's not also a great </v>
<v Speaker 5>way to just do my living days.</v>

3571
02:36:21.340 --> 02:36:26.340
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Saturdays and Sundays I'll and some </v>

3572
02:36:26.340 --> 02:36:26.340
<v Speaker 5>cities I'll come in and they'll do both </v>
<v Speaker 5>days.</v>

3573
02:36:26.380 --> 02:36:31.380
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I got coming up at the Sacramento </v>

3574
02:36:31.380 --> 02:36:31.380
<v Speaker 5>punchline,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Martin Luther King weekend.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Saturday slash Sunday for 20 Monday and </v>

3576

<v Speaker 5>just hang out there all weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have my nights free.</v>

3577
02:36:37.340 --> 02:36:40.150
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of likeminded people in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Sacramento.</v>

3578
02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:41.210

<v Speaker 5>It's a fun place.</v>

3580
02:36:43.090 --> 02:36:45.250
<v Speaker 5>So that's a really smart thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3581
02:36:45.251 --> 02:36:47.890
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you sort of reorganized the weekend,</v>

3582
02:36:48.070 --> 02:36:50.230
<v Speaker 5>you'd take a spot where it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>ordinarily open,</v>

3583
02:36:50.231 --> 02:36:53.340
<v Speaker 5>you open it for you and you can do it in</v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy clubs.</v>

3584
02:36:53.341 --> 02:36:58.341
<v Speaker 5>They see people that show up are the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ones that I told about the show through </v>

3585
02:36:58.341 --> 02:37:00.010
<v Speaker 5>my podcast or through twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the crowds are great.</v>

3586
02:37:00.011 --> 02:37:05.011
<v Speaker 5>We play a game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we play that game that I play on the </v>

3587
02:37:05.011 --> 02:37:05.011
<v Speaker 5>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll let her Balton game.</v>

<v Speaker 5>my opening act and it's a,</v>

3589
02:37:06.470 --> 02:37:07.270
<v Speaker 5>it's a blast.</v>

3590
02:37:07.300 --> 02:37:09.070
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how people from the audience come</v>

3591
02:37:09.071 --> 02:37:09.780
<v Speaker 5>up and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

<v Speaker 5>super fun and they're awake for four,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Somebody managed to get drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but everywhere else they're sober.</v>

<v Speaker 5>but like they're not that,</v>

3598
02:37:33.270 --> 02:37:35.780
<v Speaker 5>that kind of trash that you see when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>do shows at night,</v>

3599
02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:41.080
<v Speaker 5>especially in a town where there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>some sports thing in the afternoon and </v>

3600
02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:42.260

3602
02:37:44.481 --> 02:37:49.481

3626
02:38:44.331 --> 02:38:46.830

02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:41.990
<v Speaker 5>So when did you start doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't do any weekends anymore.</v>

3645
02:39:41.991 --> 02:39:43.610
<v Speaker 5>You don't do like a regular weekend and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the club?</v>

3646
02:39:44.370 --> 02:39:46.490
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some every once in a while,</v>

3647
02:39:46.491 --> 02:39:49.430
<v Speaker 5>but for the most part the smaller club </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I,</v>

3648
02:39:49.431 --> 02:39:50.840
<v Speaker 5>you don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really like.</v>

3649
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:52.690
<v Speaker 5>You don't do midnight Saturday shows do </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3650
02:39:52.730 --> 02:39:54.890
<v Speaker 5>do you ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's ridiculous.</v>

3651
02:39:54.891 --> 02:39:59.891
<v Speaker 5>Three shows in one night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the other thing I like about </v>

3652
02:39:59.891 --> 02:39:59.960
<v Speaker 5>doing the four slash 20 shows or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or even 8:00,</v>

3653
02:39:59.961 --> 02:40:03.680
<v Speaker 5>but it's the only show I love doing one </v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

3654
02:40:04.450 --> 02:40:06.800
<v Speaker 5>Like comics would like to go from club </v>
<v Speaker 5>to club to club,</v>

3655
02:40:07.140 --> 02:40:08.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like to do that.</v>

3656
02:40:08.630 --> 02:40:09.770
<v Speaker 5>Will you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3657
02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:13.080
<v Speaker 5>you like to like you have a big chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do what will you do?</v>

3658
02:40:13.081 --> 02:40:14.580
<v Speaker 5>Like an hour or so what do you do?</v>

3659
02:40:15.470 --> 02:40:19.170
<v Speaker 5>Like I do 45 a standup and then an extra</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 or 20 of,</v>

3660
02:40:19.740 --> 02:40:21.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>playing the game and fucking around with</v>

3661
02:40:21.601 --> 02:40:23.580
<v Speaker 5>the crowd and that's pretty much all </v>
<v Speaker 5>people want to see.</v>

3662
02:40:23.581 --> 02:40:24.930
<v Speaker 5>And then you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You feel like you did it.</v>

3663
02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:27.200
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to Redo it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3664
02:40:27.210 --> 02:40:28.410
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird,</v>

3665
02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:30.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not a movie where they just started</v>

3666
02:40:30.841 --> 02:40:32.590
<v Speaker 5>up again and it's the same thing again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3667
02:40:32.591 --> 02:40:37.591
<v Speaker 5>the real problem with second shows that </v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes I'll be in the middle of the </v>

3668
02:40:37.591 --> 02:40:37.591
<v Speaker 5>second show when I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did I do this?</v>

3669
02:40:37.591 --> 02:40:42.111
<v Speaker 5>But yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I can't remember because I've </v>

3670
02:40:42.111 --> 02:40:43.890
<v Speaker 5>gone through a whole show and now I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the second show.</v>

3671
02:40:43.891 --> 02:40:44.850
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're on stage,</v>

3672
02:40:44.851 --> 02:40:48.750
<v Speaker 5>you're pretty much in this zone and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the zone and I'm like,</v>

3673
02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:52.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm in the zone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been his own for a long time,</v>

3674
02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:53.680
<v Speaker 5>but did I know I did that?</v>

3675
02:40:53.730 --> 02:40:55.020
<v Speaker 5>Did I do that earlier?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

3676
02:40:55.080 --> 02:40:56.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I did that joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

3677
02:40:57.150 --> 02:40:58.370
<v Speaker 5>And then you panic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

3678
02:40:58.390 --> 02:41:00.150
<v Speaker 5>was that the first show or is it the </v>
<v Speaker 5>second show?</v>

3679
02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:02.850
<v Speaker 5>Should I try this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you go into it and you're like,</v>

3680
02:41:02.851 --> 02:41:07.851
<v Speaker 5>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you kind of have your bits tend to </v>

3681
02:41:07.851 --> 02:41:07.851
<v Speaker 5>be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3682
02:41:07.851 --> 02:41:07.851
<v Speaker 5>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the longer end,</v>

3683
02:41:07.851 --> 02:41:12.141
<v Speaker 5>like they don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't really bring up things that </v>

3684
02:41:12.141 --> 02:41:14.340
<v Speaker 5>are super brief.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So much of a case if it's a really short</v>

3685
02:41:14.341 --> 02:41:15.520
<v Speaker 5>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3686
02:41:15.690 --> 02:41:18.720
<v Speaker 5>Gets a big laugh when I say it again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it was like,</v>

3687
02:41:18.721 --> 02:41:19.120
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

3688
02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:24.220
<v Speaker 5>he said it again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't ever play up the fact that </v>

3689
02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:24.220
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hi.</v>

3690
02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:24.420
<v Speaker 5>I heard about people doing like fake </v>
<v Speaker 5>shots.</v>

3691
02:41:24.510 --> 02:41:25.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3692
02:41:25.191 --> 02:41:28.020
<v Speaker 5>I can't be fake shots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's terrible.</v>

3693
02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:29.880
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

3694
02:41:29.881 --> 02:41:31.920
<v Speaker 5>if the intention is to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey everybody,</v>

3695
02:41:31.921 --> 02:41:32.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing a shot.</v>

3696
02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:36.150
<v Speaker 5>But if I tell the staff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>send me up fake shots.</v>

3697
02:41:36.151 --> 02:41:39.170
<v Speaker 5>If people offer to buy me one really </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I don't.</v>

3698
02:41:39.260 --> 02:41:42.090
<v Speaker 5>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't say no when a shot comes up to</v>

3699
02:41:42.091 --> 02:41:43.220
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you're like a.</v>

3700
02:41:43.250 --> 02:41:45.240
<v Speaker 5>If you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm an alcoholic or something.</v>

3701
02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:46.280
<v Speaker 5>If you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

3702
02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:47.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm six years sober.</v>

3703
02:41:47.971 --> 02:41:52.971
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But with my act and the fact that I've </v>

3704
02:41:52.971 --> 02:41:54.940
<v Speaker 5>already got a cocktail up there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll send me up shots and you know,</v>

3705
02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:56.790
<v Speaker 5>sometimes I'll do them and I'm fine with</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3706
02:41:57.330 --> 02:41:59.730
<v Speaker 5>But a lot of reserves the right to drink</v>
<v Speaker 5>fake shots.</v>

3707
02:41:59.820 --> 02:42:00.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3708
02:42:00.331 --> 02:42:01.110
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

3709
02:42:01.111 --> 02:42:06.111
<v Speaker 5>it just gets it over with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you just drank a fake show telling </v>

3710
02:42:06.111 --> 02:42:06.111
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3711
02:42:06.111 --> 02:42:06.111
<v Speaker 5>I'll never do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3712
02:42:06.111 --> 02:42:08.700
<v Speaker 5>People are going to know now now the </v>
<v Speaker 5>secrets on your game son.</v>

3713
02:42:08.970 --> 02:42:09.990
<v Speaker 5>But once you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3714
02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:11.850
<v Speaker 5>if you do the shot quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's over with.</v>

3715
02:42:11.850 --> 02:42:13.710
<v Speaker 5>But if you stand there and act like </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to do it,</v>

3716
02:42:13.711 --> 02:42:16.350
<v Speaker 5>then people started chanting worse </v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't be out of it.</v>

3717
02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:18.290
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the people that went to shows before</v>

3718
02:42:18.300 --> 02:42:23.300
<v Speaker 5>going to think back at the times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you threw a shot back and screamed </v>

3719
02:42:23.300 --> 02:42:25.920
<v Speaker 5>yeehaw and jumped up and they don't act </v>
<v Speaker 5>like God damn.</v>

3720
02:42:27.270 --> 02:42:29.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't act it too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>too big.</v>

3721
02:42:29.911 --> 02:42:34.911
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just pretend to drink it because even </v>

3722
02:42:34.911 --> 02:42:36.901
<v Speaker 5>when I normally drink Assad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I usually don't make a lot of noise on </v>

3723
02:42:36.901 --> 02:42:39.831
<v Speaker 5>top of the glass and it's just a glass </v>
<v Speaker 5>of water and I do a whole song and dance</v>

3724
02:42:42.841 --> 02:42:47.841
<v Speaker 5>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The glass against the wall fucking guts </v>

3725
02:42:47.841 --> 02:42:51.110
<v Speaker 5>or is it on his tip?</v>
<v Speaker 5>All that and we find out you were just </v>

3726
02:42:51.110 --> 02:42:51.570
<v Speaker 5>stone cold,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sober drinking water,</v>

3727
02:42:52.050 --> 02:42:53.880
<v Speaker 5>putting on a show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

3728
02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:59.240
<v Speaker 5>I'd have to say that I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably happened maybe four times </v>

3729
02:42:59.240 --> 02:42:59.880
<v Speaker 5>in entire career.</v>

3730
02:43:00.330 --> 02:43:05.330
<v Speaker 5>I've never dressed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The combination of me saying to the </v>

3731
02:43:05.330 --> 02:43:07.880
<v Speaker 5>staff send me up a fake shot combined </v>
<v Speaker 5>with somebody wanting to send me up a </v>

3732
02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:09.780
<v Speaker 5>shot because it doesn't happen every </v>
<v Speaker 5>show because I'm not.</v>

3733
02:43:09.810 --> 02:43:14.810
<v Speaker 5>So what happens to the money laundering </v>
<v Speaker 5>going on here where it was a fake shot </v>

3734
02:43:14.810 --> 02:43:16.390
<v Speaker 5>is not worth anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're charging someone for a shy.</v>

3735
02:43:16.510 --> 02:43:21.510
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>regular shots barely worth the price of </v>

3736
02:43:21.510 --> 02:43:25.261
<v Speaker 5>a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't seem like there's money </v>

3737
02:43:25.261 --> 02:43:25.261
<v Speaker 5>that's unaccounted for there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3738
02:43:25.261 --> 02:43:26.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Money Laundering,</v>

3739
02:43:26.510 --> 02:43:28.390
<v Speaker 5>I think that Shit's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3740
02:43:28.391 --> 02:43:30.520
<v Speaker 5>let me tell you how I balanced it out in</v>
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

3741
02:43:30.521 --> 02:43:35.521
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rest of my years as a comic is when </v>

3742
02:43:35.521 --> 02:43:38.071
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I'm at the bar and a comedy club </v>

3743
02:43:38.071 --> 02:43:39.991
<v Speaker 5>and somebody offers to buy me a drink,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always turn it down and say I get the </v>

3744
02:43:39.991 --> 02:43:42.490
<v Speaker 5>club gives me free drinks and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>want you to buy one.</v>

3745
02:43:42.790 --> 02:43:45.100
<v Speaker 5>And then a lot of times they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to buy you one anyway.</v>

3746
02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:48.370
<v Speaker 5>Like it becomes important to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>something for you,</v>

3747
02:43:48.371 --> 02:43:51.910
<v Speaker 5>which I appreciate the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's frustrating to have,</v>

3748
02:43:51.990 --> 02:43:53.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that kind of argument with somebody,</v>

3749
02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:54.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3750
02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:58.240
<v Speaker 5>don't spend your money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't spend your money.</v>

3751
02:43:58.270 --> 02:43:59.550
<v Speaker 5>So people that have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3752
02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:04.680
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have a chance to meet you for the </v>

3753
02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:04.680
<v Speaker 5>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's important to them.</v>

3754
02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:05.260
<v Speaker 5>I understood I was still standing right </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and talk to them.</v>

3755
02:44:05.261 --> 02:44:10.261
<v Speaker 5>I don't say I don't want you to drink </v>
<v Speaker 5>and run away if they want to give you </v>

3756
02:44:10.261 --> 02:44:10.261
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3757
02:44:10.261 --> 02:44:11.590
<v Speaker 5>it's a gesture that's why never turned </v>
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>

3758
02:44:11.591 --> 02:44:12.520
<v Speaker 5>We'd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When people give me,</v>

3759
02:44:12.521 --> 02:44:15.100
<v Speaker 5>we'd really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you trust it all.</v>

3760
02:44:16.150 --> 02:44:17.080
<v Speaker 5>You don't ever think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3761
02:44:17.081 --> 02:44:19.170
<v Speaker 5>I could be smart to have this </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation before you're.</v>

3762
02:44:19.171 --> 02:44:22.690
<v Speaker 5>You're on the more paranoid interest the</v>
<v Speaker 5>whole week thing that I am.</v>

3763
02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:24.430
<v Speaker 5>I've never looked at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

3764
02:44:24.431 --> 02:44:26.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm not taking that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That looks like.</v>

3765
02:44:26.770 --> 02:44:28.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think it's such a.</v>

3766
02:44:28.151 --> 02:44:29.500
<v Speaker 5>it's such a crap shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3767
02:44:30.370 --> 02:44:33.640
<v Speaker 5>let's say I probably smoked from </v>
<v Speaker 5>strangers,</v>

3768
02:44:33.670 --> 02:44:36.160
<v Speaker 5>either a bud they gave me or some sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of joint.</v>

3769
02:44:36.161 --> 02:44:38.170
<v Speaker 5>It must be in the thousands at this </v>
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>

3770
02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:41.740
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So nothing's happened yet.</v>

3771
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:46.830
<v Speaker 5>So the odds seem incredibly good that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll get through a few more years of it </v>

3772
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:48.160
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so happy for you.</v>

3773
02:44:49.300 --> 02:44:50.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad you pulled through it.</v>

3774
02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:52.900
<v Speaker 5>Mti.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's dangerous.</v>

3775
02:44:52.901 --> 02:44:54.850
<v Speaker 5>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever worry about what's dangerous</v>

3776
02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:59.900
<v Speaker 5>provocateurs?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perhaps comps posing as donors want to </v>

3777
02:44:59.900 --> 02:45:02.981
<v Speaker 5>get high with you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to their current of trouble because </v>

3778
02:45:02.981 --> 02:45:05.670
<v Speaker 5>the voice of the movement people </v>
<v Speaker 5>craziest when Willie Nelson's tour bus,</v>

3779
02:45:08.471 --> 02:45:11.770
<v Speaker 5>that seems like it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And get them for pot.</v>

3780
02:45:11.771 --> 02:45:13.090
<v Speaker 5>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>

3781
02:45:13.350 --> 02:45:15.940
<v Speaker 5>find something else or just leave him </v>
<v Speaker 5>alone,</v>

3782
02:45:15.941 --> 02:45:17.350
<v Speaker 5>but he's in trouble for that.</v>

3783
02:45:17.350 --> 02:45:19.210
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were letting him off the hook,</v>

3784
02:45:19.211 --> 02:45:19.930
<v Speaker 5>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>between the cities that go on forever </v>
<v Speaker 5>and ever.</v>

02:46:10.660 --> 02:46:15.660
<v Speaker 8>I'm not only might doing for 20 shows,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm combining my other thing that I love</v>

3812
02:46:15.771 --> 02:46:19.700
<v Speaker 8>to do now,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is podcasts and I add 4:20</v>

3813
02:46:19.730 --> 02:46:24.730
<v Speaker 8>on thanksgiving weekend on Saturday and </v>
<v Speaker 8>Sunday I'm doing a two different tapings</v>

3814
02:46:25.911 --> 02:46:28.970
<v Speaker 8>of my podcast that I'll then be able to </v>
<v Speaker 8>cap city got will.</v>

3815
02:46:28.990 --> 02:46:33.990
<v Speaker 8>Then be able to turn around and put out </v>
<v Speaker 8>on the Internet because that's the only </v>

3816
02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:33.990
<v Speaker 8>thing I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't like about stand.</v>

3817
02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:37.510
<v Speaker 8>I love about stand up comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The fact that it's just you and the </v>

3818
02:46:37.510 --> 02:46:39.890
<v Speaker 8>audience and no one else hears it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but thanks to podcasting,</v>

3819
02:46:39.891 --> 02:46:43.370
<v Speaker 8>I'm feeling I want to get more stuff out</v>
<v Speaker 8>to people right now.</v>

3820
02:46:43.580 --> 02:46:48.580
<v Speaker 8>So this is a great opportunity for me to</v>
<v Speaker 8>show up in a town and instead of doing </v>

3821
02:46:48.580 --> 02:46:50.020
<v Speaker 8>standup,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I do the podcast.</v>

3822
02:46:50.030 --> 02:46:52.130
<v Speaker 8>So you're saying that you can't put your</v>
<v Speaker 8>standing up on the Internet?</v>

3823
02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:57.600
<v Speaker 8>Well you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know how I am going to do a thing </v>

3824
02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:00.590
<v Speaker 8>coming up soon.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think my next album is going to be two</v>

3825
02:47:00.591 --> 02:47:03.350
<v Speaker 8>discs.</v>
<v Speaker 8>One is me,</v>

3826
02:47:03.380 --> 02:47:07.580
<v Speaker 8>like I'll wake up the day of the shows </v>
<v Speaker 8>and I won't smoke pot all day,</v>

3827
02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:11.510
<v Speaker 8>maybe even stopped the day before or </v>
<v Speaker 8>something and just be crazy,</v>

3828
02:47:11.511 --> 02:47:16.511
<v Speaker 8>super sober for the first recording and </v>
<v Speaker 8>then between the first show,</v>

3829
02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:21.790
<v Speaker 8>the second show,</v>
<v Speaker 8>smoke as much weed and do as much as I </v>

3830
02:47:21.790 --> 02:47:23.600
<v Speaker 8>can and then try to do the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 8>set again,</v>

3831
02:47:25.070 --> 02:47:30.070
<v Speaker 8>try to do the album again and then </v>
<v Speaker 8>people can listen to both and see the </v>

3832
02:47:30.070 --> 02:47:31.790
<v Speaker 8>good and the bad news.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Your conclusion one into.</v>

3833
02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:37.240
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and was like Doug Benson banked and </v>

3834
02:47:38.121 --> 02:47:41.270
<v Speaker 8>unbanked or stoned and unstained or </v>
<v Speaker 8>something like that.</v>

3835
02:47:41.271 --> 02:47:46.271
<v Speaker 8>But the illusion was it 2002.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Two versions of it are two different </v>

3836
02:47:46.911 --> 02:47:48.830
<v Speaker 8>Algos.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Two completely different animals.</v>

3837
02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:50.810
<v Speaker 8>So Brian was just having fun.</v>

3838
02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:51.820
<v Speaker 8>He's a silly boy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3839
02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:56.830
<v Speaker 8>he just says things this motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So you'll sell a one or the other?</v>

3840
02:47:57.660 --> 02:48:00.590
<v Speaker 8>Is that we won both.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're buying double album.</v>

3841
02:48:00.990 --> 02:48:02.210
<v Speaker 8>You bought them both.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

3842
02:48:02.420 --> 02:48:05.420
<v Speaker 8>And I also dream of a day where I can do</v>
<v Speaker 8>a tour where like,</v>

3843
02:48:05.421 --> 02:48:08.360
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how a pearl jam sold like every night of</v>

3844
02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:11.960
<v Speaker 8>the tour on,</v>
<v Speaker 8>on the CD that one time and,</v>

3845
02:48:12.010 --> 02:48:17.010
<v Speaker 8>and bootlegs obviously happened to </v>
<v Speaker 8>everybody all the time and I'd like to </v>

3846
02:48:17.010 --> 02:48:20.051
<v Speaker 8>make my own bootleg and just make like </v>
<v Speaker 8>do a tour of 10 cities and the same act </v>

3847
02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:27.280
<v Speaker 8>essentially that whatever I'm doing at </v>
<v Speaker 8>that time and then a recorded in each </v>

3848
02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:29.540
<v Speaker 8>place and you can buy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can buy more than one if you want to</v>

3849
02:48:29.541 --> 02:48:32.560
<v Speaker 8>see the differences or you can just buy </v>
<v Speaker 8>the one from the city or from,</v>

3850
02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:38.040
<v Speaker 8>from a city you think will be funny to </v>
<v Speaker 8>hear me interacting with people of that </v>

3851
02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:38.040
<v Speaker 8>city.</v>

3852
02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:40.310
<v Speaker 8>That's a funny idea.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And have a bunch of different recordings</v>

3853
02:48:40.311 --> 02:48:41.780
<v Speaker 8>to choose from.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

3854
02:48:41.870 --> 02:48:45.350
<v Speaker 8>some comics used to sell recordings of </v>
<v Speaker 8>the show that you just went to.</v>

3855
02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:50.680
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So like cds at a club or two has tried </v>

3856
02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:51.960
<v Speaker 8>to kind of toy with that sort of idea.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A lot of Goddamn cds.</v>

3857
02:48:51.980 --> 02:48:54.800
<v Speaker 8>But it also doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it only appeals to the drunkest audience</v>

3858
02:48:54.801 --> 02:48:58.970
<v Speaker 8>members yelled out the dumbest Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3859
02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:03.350
<v Speaker 8>it's kind of a weird thing to say here </v>
<v Speaker 8>by what you just what just happened.</v>

3860
02:49:04.250 --> 02:49:09.250
<v Speaker 8>But that's what I'm doing with podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like I do podcasts where people were </v>

3861
02:49:09.250 --> 02:49:10.590
<v Speaker 8>there live and then they listen to it </v>
<v Speaker 8>later.</v>

3862
02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:13.220
<v Speaker 8>It's like their email address and you go</v>
<v Speaker 8>here,</v>

3863
02:49:13.230 --> 02:49:15.960
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to send you a link to where </v>
<v Speaker 8>you can buy this for five bucks.</v>

3864
02:49:16.020 --> 02:49:18.450
<v Speaker 8>You have your podcast setup where some </v>
<v Speaker 8>of them are free,</v>

3865
02:49:18.451 --> 02:49:21.450
<v Speaker 8>some of them aren't weekly free one of </v>
<v Speaker 8>one week.</v>

3866
02:49:21.570 --> 02:49:24.660
<v Speaker 8>There's bonus free ones that I do like </v>
<v Speaker 8>where I record,</v>

3867
02:49:24.661 --> 02:49:26.730
<v Speaker 8>like if I'm in a rental car with another</v>
<v Speaker 8>comic,</v>

3868
02:49:26.731 --> 02:49:28.800
<v Speaker 8>I'll just record an episode of the show </v>
<v Speaker 8>while we're driving.</v>

3869
02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:34.460
<v Speaker 8>And so I put those up pretty frequently </v>
<v Speaker 8>and then like once or twice a month,</v>

3870
02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:40.040
<v Speaker 8>usually once a month I'll have a episode</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's $2 in the comedy album section of</v>

3871
02:49:43.111 --> 02:49:48.111
<v Speaker 8>Itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is a fun place to be and to be </v>

3872
02:49:48.111 --> 02:49:50.361
<v Speaker 8>that cheap because like right now one of</v>
<v Speaker 8>mine is like number one because it's </v>

3873
02:49:50.361 --> 02:49:53.691
<v Speaker 8>only $2.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then all the album or the album is </v>

3874
02:49:53.691 --> 02:49:54.330
<v Speaker 8>behind it costs like eight bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So you get a nice,</v>

3875
02:49:54.331 --> 02:49:59.331
<v Speaker 8>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 8>nice placement for a little while and </v>

3876
02:49:59.331 --> 02:49:59.331
<v Speaker 8>then it falls pretty fast because,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3877
02:49:59.331 --> 02:50:02.700
<v Speaker 8>people will buy it later,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but most people buy it right away or you</v>

3878
02:50:02.701 --> 02:50:03.990
<v Speaker 8>know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>shortly after it goes,</v>

3879
02:50:04.260 --> 02:50:06.780
<v Speaker 8>becomes available and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3880
02:50:06.781 --> 02:50:07.140
<v Speaker 8>the money.</v>

3881
02:50:07.150 --> 02:50:09.740
<v Speaker 8>So you off air,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how much the money as well,</v>

3882
02:50:09.750 --> 02:50:10.350
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

3883
02:50:10.351 --> 02:50:13.280
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's just a different route.</v>

3884
02:50:13.610 --> 02:50:18.610
<v Speaker 8>Gang signs at me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a different route that I've gone </v>

3885
02:50:18.610 --> 02:50:18.610
<v Speaker 8>instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3886
02:50:18.610 --> 02:50:21.921
<v Speaker 8>instead of having actual advertisers not</v>
<v Speaker 8>against having advertisers,</v>

3887
02:50:22.021 --> 02:50:24.630
<v Speaker 8>I just have already gathered,</v>
<v Speaker 8>found the right match.</v>

3888
02:50:24.970 --> 02:50:29.970
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People just kept the ones that every </v>

3889
02:50:29.970 --> 02:50:32.151
<v Speaker 8>other podcast has.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I did those for awhile and I just </v>

3890
02:50:32.151 --> 02:50:32.550
<v Speaker 8>felt like if I listen to a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 8>podcasts,</v>

3891
02:50:32.551 --> 02:50:34.740
<v Speaker 8>if I had to always hear about audible </v>
<v Speaker 8>books,</v>

3892
02:50:34.741 --> 02:50:38.040
<v Speaker 8>every podcast I listened to about one </v>
<v Speaker 8>800 flowers.</v>

3893
02:50:38.070 --> 02:50:39.750
<v Speaker 8>Doug,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I never did that one.</v>

3894
02:50:39.751 --> 02:50:41.970
<v Speaker 8>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I are Adam and eve or whatever.</v>

3895
02:50:41.971 --> 02:50:44.520
<v Speaker 8>I wouldn't want to hear about the same </v>
<v Speaker 8>thing all over the place.</v>

3896
02:50:44.700 --> 02:50:46.560
<v Speaker 8>I think each show should have its own </v>
<v Speaker 8>thing.</v>

3897
02:50:46.830 --> 02:50:51.830
<v Speaker 8>Unfortunately for me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>movie studios can't really support me </v>

3898
02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:54.921
<v Speaker 8>because I trashed movies and I can't get</v>
<v Speaker 8>like a movie theater chain to support me</v>

3899
02:50:55.351 --> 02:50:58.080
<v Speaker 8>because people go see movies at the </v>
<v Speaker 8>theater near their house.</v>

3900
02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:02.340
<v Speaker 8>Do you ever feel like confined by the </v>
<v Speaker 8>theme of your podcast?</v>

3901
02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:03.430
<v Speaker 8>The movie thing?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3902
02:51:03.540 --> 02:51:05.790
<v Speaker 8>Well I would,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if I were you and you know,</v>

3903
02:51:05.791 --> 02:51:10.791
<v Speaker 8>like your,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your interest in and the amount of </v>

3904
02:51:10.791 --> 02:51:11.370
<v Speaker 8>movies you see is so far fewer than than</v>
<v Speaker 8>what I do,</v>

3905
02:51:11.640 --> 02:51:13.770
<v Speaker 8>so like I could see where that could be </v>
<v Speaker 8>limiting.</v>

3906
02:51:13.771 --> 02:51:16.020
<v Speaker 8>If you just feel like a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why would you choose that?</v>

3907
02:51:16.021 --> 02:51:18.040
<v Speaker 8>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just you.</v>

3908
02:51:18.220 --> 02:51:20.870
<v Speaker 8>If you weren't a comic and you were in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you were in,</v>

3909
02:51:20.900 --> 02:51:23.250
<v Speaker 8>you worked in UFC like you do,</v>
<v Speaker 8>would you,</v>

3910
02:51:23.280 --> 02:51:28.280
<v Speaker 8>would you think you'd be able to find </v>
<v Speaker 8>ongoing satisfaction just talking about </v>

3911
02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:29.450
<v Speaker 8>UFC as a podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sure,</v>

3912
02:51:29.730 --> 02:51:30.420
<v Speaker 8>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3913
02:51:30.421 --> 02:51:31.920
<v Speaker 8>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's how much I love movies.</v>

3914
02:51:32.070 --> 02:51:34.290
<v Speaker 8>It's just that I could just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I could talk on and on and on,</v>

3915
02:51:34.291 --> 02:51:35.220
<v Speaker 8>but if I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>dude,</v>

3916
02:51:35.221 --> 02:51:40.221
<v Speaker 8>just a UFC podcast every week,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'd feel a little defined by it or you </v>

3917
02:51:40.221 --> 02:51:43.710
<v Speaker 8>would because you've got so many other </v>
<v Speaker 8>areas that you're interested in,</v>

3918
02:51:43.890 --> 02:51:45.690
<v Speaker 8>but I'm saying like somebody who's just </v>
<v Speaker 8>really,</v>

3919
02:51:45.691 --> 02:51:48.060
<v Speaker 8>that's their main focus,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like because for me,</v>

3920
02:51:48.061 --> 02:51:50.040
<v Speaker 8>growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>my main focus was just movies.</v>

3921
02:51:50.070 --> 02:51:54.390
<v Speaker 8>Like I wanted to watch them and be in </v>
<v Speaker 8>them and that's all I cared about.</v>

3922
02:51:54.540 --> 02:51:56.910
<v Speaker 8>Do you do,</v>
<v Speaker 8>do you write scripts for the two?</v>

3923
02:51:56.911 --> 02:51:58.110
<v Speaker 8>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

3924
02:51:58.111 --> 02:51:58.860
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a little bit,</v>

3925
02:51:58.861 --> 02:51:59.430
<v Speaker 8>but I've,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3926
02:51:59.431 --> 02:52:00.840
<v Speaker 8>I've grown really,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

3927
02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:06.440
<v Speaker 8>that's the good and bad of podcasting is</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's allowed to talk about and </v>

3928
02:52:07.600 --> 02:52:11.680
<v Speaker 8>participate in what I want to do without</v>
<v Speaker 8>ever having to sit by myself and write,</v>

3929
02:52:13.400 --> 02:52:18.400
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like the process of just sitting and </v>

3930
02:52:18.400 --> 02:52:19.360
<v Speaker 8>writing something while the outcome is </v>
<v Speaker 8>very satisfying.</v>

3931
02:52:19.630 --> 02:52:22.960
<v Speaker 8>Like right now I'm working on a book and</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

3932
02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:28.200
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's torture for me to sit down and </v>

3933
02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:28.200
<v Speaker 8>write a chapter of my book.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why?</v>

3934
02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:30.160
<v Speaker 8>Because they're just sitting there by </v>
<v Speaker 8>myself.</v>

3935
02:52:30.161 --> 02:52:32.350
<v Speaker 8>Writing is just not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's no fun to me.</v>

3936
02:52:32.351 --> 02:52:34.570
<v Speaker 8>I want to always have,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3937
02:52:34.571 --> 02:52:38.260
<v Speaker 8>a TV on or listening to something or </v>
<v Speaker 8>watching something going,</v>

3938
02:52:38.320 --> 02:52:40.060
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>going out and doing something.</v>

3939
02:52:40.380 --> 02:52:42.710
<v Speaker 8>Go to starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What is that exactly?</v>

3940
02:52:42.770 --> 02:52:44.500
<v Speaker 8>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those guys are,</v>

3941
02:52:44.501 --> 02:52:49.501
<v Speaker 8>that's what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like I do enjoy sometimes sitting </v>

3942
02:52:49.501 --> 02:52:50.050
<v Speaker 8>in a whole foods or something and </v>
<v Speaker 8>getting work done on my computer because</v>

3943
02:52:50.051 --> 02:52:52.450
<v Speaker 8>it's fun to have all that weird stimuli </v>
<v Speaker 8>around you,</v>

3944
02:52:52.451 --> 02:52:54.130
<v Speaker 8>but you can still just kinda look at </v>
<v Speaker 8>your,</v>

3945
02:52:54.131 --> 02:52:55.420
<v Speaker 8>what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

3946
02:52:55.580 --> 02:53:00.580
<v Speaker 8>just look up whenever.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Anything interesting because your ideas </v>

3947
02:53:00.580 --> 02:53:02.320
<v Speaker 8>too when you're looking around.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like if you have your twitter handy,</v>

3948
02:53:02.321 --> 02:53:04.120
<v Speaker 8>it's like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you see something stupid ass.</v>

3949
02:53:04.121 --> 02:53:06.490
<v Speaker 8>Especially when you're paying bills.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3950
02:53:06.520 --> 02:53:11.520
<v Speaker 8>We gotta wrap this picture but that's </v>
<v Speaker 8>the thing I do like thank God I do have </v>

3951
02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:11.920
<v Speaker 8>the marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not God,</v>

3952
02:53:11.921 --> 02:53:12.940
<v Speaker 8>but you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jesus.</v>

3954
02:53:14.501 --> 02:53:19.501

<v Speaker 8>does help to make writing less boring </v>
