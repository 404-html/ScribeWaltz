<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

7
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for having me.</v>

8
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for coming on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

9
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.353
<v Speaker 1>You wrote an article and I tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you about my chiropractic </v>

10
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:18.744
<v Speaker 1>journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I had a podcast that I did with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend Steve Rinella a few weeks back at</v>

12
00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:23.714
<v Speaker 1>Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he has a brother that has a </v>

13
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.523
<v Speaker 1>herniated disc real bad and he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>atrophy in one of his arms because he's </v>

14
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>got a push nerve and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>

15
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Bulging disc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Good.</v>

16
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

17
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>we got to talk and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

18
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:37.194
<v Speaker 1>that guy's got to do something about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away because the more time you </v>

19
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:40.194
<v Speaker 1>spend with an atrophied arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the longer it takes to rehabilitate </v>

20
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:43.674
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a pretty common injury with </v>

21
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>martial artists.</v>

22
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Get get yourself to a physical therapist</v>
<v Speaker 1>right away and get an Mri.</v>

23
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>And then spinal decompression the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal and see whatever science based.</v>

24
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he goes,</v>

25
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.450
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about chiropractors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

26
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>so I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think chiropractors are bullshit.</v>

27
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.270
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.071
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

29
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:05.671
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

30
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just had bad experiences with it.</v>

31
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>And then I've read some things about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>being bullshit.</v>

32
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>And then I got home after the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I smoked a joint.</v>

33
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.630
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times when I spoke to Paul </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

34
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I feel bad about some of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said rarely do.</v>

35
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>It's I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

36
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I smoked more than the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist.</v>

37
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>My boyfriend is a director of r and D at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pot lab.</v>

38
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.333
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is some pot kicking around on a </v>

39
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>regular basis while we get it free from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people.</v>

40
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>I have to tell people at shows and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespect to people that offer to me.</v>

41
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please don't give me any pot.</v>

42
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.140
<v Speaker 1>I can't take your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have too much pot.</v>

43
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a similar problem.</v>

44
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>

45
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I smoke the pot and then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

46
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.483
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that was rude saying because I </v>

47
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>know people that are chiropractors and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know they're nice people and I know they</v>

48
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>mean well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

49
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they mean,</v>

50
00:01:58.621 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>

51
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're wrong,</v>

52
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:03.090
<v Speaker 1>but they mean well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

53
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go maybe I was being a dick.</v>

54
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.473
<v Speaker 1>So then I Google chiropractic and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started reading and I spend hours and </v>

55
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 1>hours reading about the history of cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say this in big air quotes,</v>

56
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>chiropractic medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

57
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.170

58
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:26.004

<v Speaker 1>all you people and I've got a ton of </v>

59
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.090
<v Speaker 1>messages from chiropractors that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure nice folks and they're really upset</v>

60
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>because they liked this podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

61
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:38.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.460
<v Speaker 1>And you said you have to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

64
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a lot of you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

65
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a lot of you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a lot of you try really hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help your patients and I'm sure a lot of</v>

67
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>you incorporate a lot of other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like massage,</v>

68
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>cold laser and real science into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapies.</v>

69
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>But the</v>

70
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 2>origination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the origin,</v>

71
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.003
<v Speaker 2>the original guy who created </v>
<v Speaker 2>chiropractic medicine was a complete </v>

72
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 2>total bullshit artists fucking whack </v>
<v Speaker 2>just guy right here.</v>

73
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this character Daniel,</v>

74
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:13.864
<v Speaker 2>David Palmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it started as a magnetic healer in </v>

75
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Davenport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iowa.</v>

76
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole thing is hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent horseshit.</v>

77
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.400
<v Speaker 2>This article that we wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sent this through A.</v>

78
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.253
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally my articles I go through at </v>

79
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 2>least two editors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give or take this one,</v>

80
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 2>we put through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe three editors,</v>

81
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:31.864
<v Speaker 2>a fact checker and our lawyer to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that we were bulletproof on it </v>

82
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 2>because we wanted to make sure that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that,</v>

83
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.533
<v Speaker 2>that we didn't say anything that could </v>
<v Speaker 2>get sued basically in a lot of the </v>

84
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 2>information from this came directly from</v>
<v Speaker 2>his book,</v>

85
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:43.954
<v Speaker 2>from his own book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we weren't taking anything out of </v>

86
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:47.404
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the quotes on how chiropractic </v>

87
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 2>started came directly from the book and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he after,</v>

88
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:55.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after cracking a,</v>

89
00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.420
<v Speaker 2>a half deaf persons or a deaf person's </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling Jamie just had pulled up in that</v>

90
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 2>article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull it back up,</v>

91
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

92
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 2>So you could see that he claimed that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>cracked a deaf person's back.</v>

93
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 2>And restorative healing or his hearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

94
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 2>a couple of things could have happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

95
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.493
<v Speaker 2>Either one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no actual medical consent </v>

96
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 2>given because this person was def.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

97
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not sure how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

98
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.973
<v Speaker 2>how that came about too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't actually restore the hearing </v>

99
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 2>because there are no nerves in the spine</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to your hearing.</v>

100
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

101
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.130
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy is just lying.</v>

102
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 2>There are a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 2>and we're not sure what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

104
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are still in Chiropractic,</v>

105
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:33.904
<v Speaker 2>could have done a few things with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could have disavowed what happened </v>

106
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:36.431
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

107
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:37.264
<v Speaker 2>we still have a system by which we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>really try to relieve pain through </v>

108
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 2>spinal manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

109
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:42.184
<v Speaker 2>there are still articles out today from </v>
<v Speaker 2>chiropractors today that try to claim </v>

110
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:49.750
<v Speaker 2>that yes indeed he did restore hearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was like,</v>

111
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

112
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.823
<v Speaker 2>Could you guys just maybe back down on </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the nuttier claims because </v>

113
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is some,</v>

114
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 2>some minor evidence that you can relieve</v>
<v Speaker 2>back pain,</v>

115
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.760
<v Speaker 2>lower back pain with spinal </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulation.</v>

116
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 2>And there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a Kairos that are trying to be</v>

117
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:04.444
<v Speaker 2>science based with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the history of it is so ridiculous </v>

118
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:10.480
<v Speaker 2>and they try to back down on nothing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not how science works.</v>

119
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:11.314
<v Speaker 2>Science works with the newest evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it tries to figure out what's real </v>

120
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:15.574
<v Speaker 2>and what's not and they try to double </v>
<v Speaker 2>down on all the craziest stuff and I </v>

121
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 2>think there are Kairos that are trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fix the field maybe and say,</v>

122
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:23.674
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spinal manipulation can help with back </v>

123
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:27.500
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what this claims.</v>

124
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.353
<v Speaker 2>It claims that you can fix everything in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body through these vertebral </v>

125
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 2>subluxations that have never been shown </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is a subluxation?</v>

126
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 2>So there are a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

127
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 2>there are two terms being used here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chiropractic uses it incorrectly.</v>

128
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 2>And in medicine we use it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a subluxation,</v>

129
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 2>the actual medical term means that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>joint pops out halfway.</v>

130
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:47.584
<v Speaker 2>So you have a dislocation was which is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>complete separation of a joint </v>

131
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:51.544
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a subluxation is a partial </v>

132
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:54.244
<v Speaker 2>dislocation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know because they happened to my </v>

133
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 2>shoulder there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a fun party trick.</v>

134
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll spare you a but of subluxation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the chiropractic sense.</v>

135
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 2>They use this medical term kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>incorrectly.</v>

136
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 2>They say that your spine can be somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of joint basically,</v>

137
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:09.554
<v Speaker 2>and it causes all your health problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your pancreas is malfunctioning </v>

138
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 2>because your spine is out of alignment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's never been proven to happen and</v>

139
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:17.354
<v Speaker 2>they claim that they can put you into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>state of health by massaging your back </v>

140
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:22.330
<v Speaker 2>and it.</v>

141
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.163
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's important about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was created out of thin air by a </v>

142
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:27.674
<v Speaker 2>guy who was a quack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The origin is not based on years and </v>

143
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 2>years of medical research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of this.</v>

144
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:34.844
<v Speaker 2>All of this came from the 18 hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a guy who was completely full of </v>

145
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:40.070
<v Speaker 2>shit and he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a magnetic healer.</v>

146
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>magnetic healing,</v>

147
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.613
<v Speaker 2>you can still see at the store these </v>
<v Speaker 2>little like knee braces that have </v>

148
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:48.260
<v Speaker 2>magnets and a guys save your money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get a regular old knee brace.</v>

149
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:49.094
<v Speaker 2>If you feel any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any relief from one of those magnetic </v>

150
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 2>braces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just from the brace.</v>

151
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:55.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not the fucking magnet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

152
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Placebo effects or the placebo effect is</v>

153
00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 2>a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get some relief from that,</v>

154
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:02.564
<v Speaker 2>but don't bother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which may also account for some of the </v>

155
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:06.920
<v Speaker 2>pain relief from chiropractic medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

156
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:07.754
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're doing exactly like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing some massage along with </v>

157
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:11.774
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing and some of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem because massage actually helps </v>

158
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.073
<v Speaker 2>and there there are studies that show </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who go to a massage therapist or </v>

159
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:23.580
<v Speaker 2>massage practitioner tend to get more </v>
<v Speaker 2>relief than people who go to a,</v>

160
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.590
<v Speaker 2>to a chiropractor.</v>

161
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 2>So please go to a massage therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to a,</v>

162
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a physical therapist.</v>

163
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:30.104
<v Speaker 2>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are your science based </v>

164
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.110
<v Speaker 2>practitioners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chiropractic.</v>

165
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 2>It started out of bullshit and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>stayed directly in bullshit.</v>

166
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no reason that anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have from this guy,</v>

167
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:45.440
<v Speaker 2>from this one original guy who created </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

168
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 2>This guy was a magnetic healer who came </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with this somehow or another,</v>

169
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:52.310
<v Speaker 2>it's slipped through the cracks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what this is.</v>

170
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.173
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're running around calling </v>

171
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:55.380
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doctors say,</v>

172
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.020
<v Speaker 2>this guy said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of these guys who got angry at me,</v>

173
00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.873
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten at least two dozen maybe </v>

174
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.470
<v Speaker 2>angry messages for rafters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of them,</v>

175
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:06.620
<v Speaker 2>the guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does a podiatrist go to medical school?</v>

176
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck they go to podiatry school.</v>

177
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take,</v>

178
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.250
<v Speaker 2>they have a medical residency that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to do for three years.</v>

179
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.860
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

180
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 2>they actually go to a hospital to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the hospital and the podiatry is like</v>

181
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.450
<v Speaker 2>an actual science of studying this foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of them are.</v>

182
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.313
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone go ahead and please fact check </v>

183
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:26.714
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe some of them are pediatric </v>

184
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.363
<v Speaker 2>surgeons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have to know all the anatomy </v>

185
00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:32.180
<v Speaker 2>of the feet in order to treat actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot conditions.</v>

186
00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:34.820
<v Speaker 2>They are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are part of the medical system.</v>

187
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Ca chiropractic works kind of separately</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on theories that uh,</v>

188
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 2>that have never been proven to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't even do imaging like half.</v>

189
00:08:42.891 --> 00:08:43.724
<v Speaker 2>I believe something like half of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chiropractic clinics don't even have x </v>

190
00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:49.130
<v Speaker 2>rays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how can they show you 100 percent for</v>

191
00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 2>sure that what they're claiming is </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in your back isn't happening.</v>

192
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.900
<v Speaker 2>And I read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

193
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.180
<v Speaker 2>these are statistics that I found </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight from chiropractic websites,</v>

194
00:08:57.181 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 2>from their organizations.</v>

195
00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:59.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

196
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.713
<v Speaker 2>I had this referenced in the article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just am blanking on which place had </v>

197
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the chiropractic boards that does</v>

198
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.720
<v Speaker 2>large scale surveys within Chiropractic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

199
00:09:08.721 --> 00:09:11.070
<v Speaker 2>about half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were a lot of places,</v>

200
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people I'm sure said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my chiropractor's good microfracture</v>

201
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 2>doesn't do the bullshit stuff and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my friends said that too.</v>

202
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:18.120
<v Speaker 2>They said no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just crack my back.</v>

203
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 2>They don't try to sell me any bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplements.</v>

204
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.550
<v Speaker 2>About half of chiropractors do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit stuff.</v>

205
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:25.650
<v Speaker 2>They do the extra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the extraneous wellness stuff.</v>

206
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a 50,</v>

207
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:28.854
<v Speaker 2>if you're playing Russian roulette and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a 50 percent chance of getting </v>

208
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:32.780
<v Speaker 2>a bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

209
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or getting a bullet,</v>

210
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.070
<v Speaker 2>are you going to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

211
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:35.963
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want a 50 percent chance of </v>

212
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 2>having a bullshit Dr who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

213
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 2>maybe your colds really a German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

214
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.240
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's a bowl.</v>

215
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.073
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the bullshit doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want the guy who knows what he's </v>

216
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:48.180
<v Speaker 2>talking about and this is what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting with chiropractic.</v>

217
00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:52.380
<v Speaker 2>You're getting a bullshit doctor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's even if you're not a doctor.</v>

218
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

219
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Part of the problem they call themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>

220
00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.080
<v Speaker 2>have you seen that's so fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>checking in on this.</v>

221
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.860
<v Speaker 2>They don't go to medical school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

222
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:02.694
<v Speaker 2>they go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go to chiropractic school is now </v>

223
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.033
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest chiropractice schools</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the country is a Palmer chiropractic </v>

224
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:11.790
<v Speaker 2>college and that's named for DD Palmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who launched,</v>

225
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:17.030
<v Speaker 2>launched this bevy of bullshit on us and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he a guy named after the guy who claimed</v>

226
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:20.670
<v Speaker 2>it heal up and it's one of one of my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is crazy.</v>

227
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:23.100
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to be a fun story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By Fun,</v>

228
00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:25.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the guys I went to Undergrad with</v>

229
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.110
<v Speaker 2>a went to Palmer chiropractic college.</v>

230
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Now the acceptance rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent tuition,</v>

231
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:33.320
<v Speaker 2>$34,000 a year to learn how to crack </v>
<v Speaker 2>babies,</v>

232
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:34.930
<v Speaker 2>spines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the guy I went to college,</v>

233
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.883
<v Speaker 2>but some people do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them do know it is a growing </v>

234
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 2>field and chiropractic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one guy said this hilarious.</v>

235
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:45.030
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying the crack babies bonds.</v>

236
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:47.740
<v Speaker 2>It's a gentleman emulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why?</v>

237
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the thing.</v>

238
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.570
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck are you manipulating?</v>

239
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Because there's no evidence whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 2>that helps babies.</v>

240
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 2>The babies aren't complaining about back</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>

241
00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

242
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here are the two things that I've heard.</v>

243
00:10:58.471 --> 00:10:59.304
<v Speaker 2>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

244
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.280
<v Speaker 2>is that it's so gentle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't even bruise a tomato skin.</v>

245
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Then why are you doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why now?</v>

246
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.620
<v Speaker 2>The other thing they say it's bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they can pay.</v>

247
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 2>They can charge parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why the other thing they say is,</v>

248
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:11.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from doing that,</v>

249
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:12.504
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

250
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.900
<v Speaker 2>and this is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this infuriates me so much.</v>

251
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say from manipulating the spine,</v>

252
00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 2>because the spine has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within those bones,</v>

253
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:25.800
<v Speaker 2>they had the spinal column and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nerves control everything in the body.</v>

254
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.400
<v Speaker 2>And so from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from stimulate,</v>

255
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.620
<v Speaker 2>stimulating the nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can give the infant all the immunity</v>

256
00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:36.600
<v Speaker 2>it needs to not need their vaccinations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's when I get really.</v>

257
00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they claimed this shit there.</v>

258
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.650
<v Speaker 2>You got to be real specific claiming </v>
<v Speaker 2>that by manipulating a baby,</v>

259
00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:45.880
<v Speaker 2>they don't need vaccines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is no,</v>

260
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.980
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

261
00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:47.814
<v Speaker 2>This is not all chiropractors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the American chiropractic </v>

262
00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:50.694
<v Speaker 2>association.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is fairly well cited within the </v>

263
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 2>article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American Chiropractic Association,</v>

264
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:55.114
<v Speaker 2>they are generally anti-drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to use the least amount of </v>

265
00:11:57.191 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 2>inter inter medical interventions </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

266
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 2>And chiropractors are not in most states</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country.</v>

267
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.100
<v Speaker 2>They are not cleared to either prescribe</v>
<v Speaker 2>or give vaccinations.</v>

268
00:12:08.101 --> 00:12:08.934
<v Speaker 2>So if you can manage to get a family to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come into you for pretty much all of </v>

269
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:12.844
<v Speaker 2>their medical needs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that increases your bottom line and it </v>

270
00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:16.840
<v Speaker 2>stops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

271
00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:17.621
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to say,</v>

272
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:18.850
<v Speaker 2>we can do everything for you.</v>

273
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:19.683
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chiropractors and cleared for </v>

274
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:22.410
<v Speaker 2>vaccination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course they don't.</v>

275
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.090
<v Speaker 2>They don't give vaccinations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean one of.</v>

276
00:12:25.091 --> 00:12:27.910
<v Speaker 2>There's one state in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was Wisconsin,</v>

277
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:28.744
<v Speaker 2>where they were trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>chiropractors to be able to give pre </v>

278
00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:35.341
<v Speaker 2>sports physicals and in in some cases </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pre sports physical is the only time</v>

279
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:37.690
<v Speaker 2>all year when a student will see a </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor.</v>

280
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.910
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is infuriating.</v>

281
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:40.744
<v Speaker 2>So the like whenever a doctor and I mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like you can look at the acs </v>

282
00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:45.154
<v Speaker 2>website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a put a couple of links to it </v>

283
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:48.270
<v Speaker 2>in the article where they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

284
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.980
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not very provax and I mean their</v>

285
00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:54.880
<v Speaker 2>language on it is under the condition of</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of choice,</v>

286
00:12:54.881 --> 00:12:55.714
<v Speaker 2>medical choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like they don't say straight </v>

287
00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:59.410
<v Speaker 2>out vaccines don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're bad for you,</v>

288
00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:00.244
<v Speaker 2>but they're kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wishy washy on it and they're </v>

289
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:02.530
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

290
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.900
<v Speaker 2>They don't say vaccines work and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should get them,</v>

291
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.110
<v Speaker 2>but a couple of chiropractors will try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say we don't need vaccines.</v>

292
00:13:08.111 --> 00:13:08.944
<v Speaker 2>We can increase your immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can increase your immunity by </v>

293
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.350
<v Speaker 2>pressing zero evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero evidence.</v>

294
00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do me a favor,</v>

295
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.733
<v Speaker 2>tell me which spine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which part of the spine you press on to </v>

296
00:13:18.911 --> 00:13:21.100
<v Speaker 2>give child immunity to measles and </v>
<v Speaker 2>polio.</v>

297
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Give me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me.</v>

298
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Give me the titers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Test that child's titers to show me that</v>

299
00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:26.104
<v Speaker 2>they're immune to polio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now from you touching their goddamn </v>

300
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.140
<v Speaker 2>spine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I.</v>

301
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.891
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about this?</v>

302
00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:32.260
<v Speaker 2>How about I'll punch you in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to punch a chiropractor.</v>

303
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.220
<v Speaker 2>How about I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

304
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 2>not just give you a few little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little pokes in the back and then</v>

305
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:40.600
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be immune to smallpox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just just let me know how that works.</v>

306
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.433
<v Speaker 2>But I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get behind a system that has no </v>

307
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:48.070
<v Speaker 2>evidence and tells me it's going to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>children immune to deadly diseases.</v>

308
00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Here's a real question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did it get this far?</v>

309
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.250
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did this guy who's a magnetic healer</v>

310
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:55.084
<v Speaker 2>who had no background in medicine come </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with this system and then have it </v>

311
00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:03.610
<v Speaker 2>spread all over the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a good story,</v>

312
00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:08.320
<v Speaker 2>isn't that people love a story that says</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can heal them without,</v>

313
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.173
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without taking dangerous drugs and at </v>

314
00:14:10.211 --> 00:14:11.044
<v Speaker 2>the time and forget about medicine </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't even just just helping you with </v>

315
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:16.930
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

316
00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:17.764
<v Speaker 2>it's partially because of when it came </v>
<v Speaker 2>up because we only found out 50 years </v>

317
00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:23.390
<v Speaker 2>after this that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>

318
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.363
<v Speaker 2>frontal lobotomies were a bad fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea and that the little was going to </v>

319
00:14:27.361 --> 00:14:28.710
<v Speaker 2>kill babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

320
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.583
<v Speaker 2>so we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were really fucking bad at medicine </v>

321
00:14:32.501 --> 00:14:34.480
<v Speaker 2>when this came up and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

322
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.433
<v Speaker 2>we're way better at it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we still don't have the answers to </v>

323
00:14:37.781 --> 00:14:38.140
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

324
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:38.973
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say a failure of the </v>

325
00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:41.164
<v Speaker 2>medical system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a sign of where we are </v>

326
00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:43.264
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So think about the number of people who </v>

327
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:47.630
<v Speaker 2>have sent us anecdotes saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

328
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:48.483
<v Speaker 2>I was in miserable pain and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>chiropractor was the only thing that </v>

329
00:14:50.351 --> 00:14:52.640
<v Speaker 2>worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like maybe you needed to get a,</v>

330
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to physical therapy for longer term </v>

331
00:14:55.821 --> 00:14:57.500
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these people that are still going to</v>

332
00:14:57.501 --> 00:14:58.334
<v Speaker 2>their Kairos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means they're still in pain and they </v>

333
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:02.960
<v Speaker 2>should go to a physical therapist for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

334
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:03.794
<v Speaker 2>a couple months of therapy that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually strengthened their backs and </v>

335
00:15:06.441 --> 00:15:09.320
<v Speaker 2>take care of those issues and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a massage,</v>

336
00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:12.260
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to their Cairo because</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical has not said,</v>

337
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have a tricorder that can scan </v>

338
00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:15.104
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show the exact thing and say here's the </v>

339
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 2>exact medicine drug and thing that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>fix you.</v>

340
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.300
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hate to use this term,</v>

341
00:15:20.301 --> 00:15:21.134
<v Speaker 2>but it's out of the failures of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical system that something like this </v>

342
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.360
<v Speaker 2>has shown up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're not perfect at medicine yet.</v>

343
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:30.320
<v Speaker 2>And that's why alternative medicine </v>
<v Speaker 2>swoops in with bullshit.</v>

344
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.793
<v Speaker 3>It's just a matter of innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a certain level that </v>

345
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.183
<v Speaker 3>the medical community is at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty staggering what they're </v>

346
00:15:37.291 --> 00:15:38.124
<v Speaker 3>capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still growing and learning and </v>

347
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.583
<v Speaker 3>we're in a constant state of progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's shocking to me is how far </v>

348
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 3>this medical healer or magnetic healers </v>
<v Speaker 3>quack idea.</v>

349
00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.473
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought it was based on </v>

350
00:15:53.971 --> 00:15:55.140
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

351
00:15:55.141 --> 00:15:55.974
<v Speaker 3>I really did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been going to a chiropractor for </v>

352
00:15:57.091 --> 00:15:59.850
<v Speaker 3>years or different chiropractors for </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

353
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.550
<v Speaker 3>It's in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them was like this guy used to go</v>

354
00:16:02.551 --> 00:16:06.600
<v Speaker 3>to on Hollywood is 40 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's literally he would take care of you</v>

355
00:16:06.601 --> 00:16:07.434
<v Speaker 3>for like 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would rub your back a little bit and </v>

356
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.760
<v Speaker 3>massage a little bit and then he would </v>
<v Speaker 3>pop it and then go,</v>

357
00:16:12.761 --> 00:16:13.321
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got it.</v>

358
00:16:13.321 --> 00:16:14.850
<v Speaker 3>We got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'd be like,</v>

359
00:16:14.851 --> 00:16:16.240
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would think her head,</v>

360
00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:17.760
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'll start feeling better now.</v>

361
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.190
<v Speaker 2>I've got a foam roller for 20 bucks that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can lend.</v>

362
00:16:20.191 --> 00:16:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Jill will crack your back really well.</v>

363
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:23.661
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

364
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:24.494
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

365
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.473
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just stunning to me that insurance </v>

366
00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:29.930
<v Speaker 3>companies pay for it and that it's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>around so long.</v>

367
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.660
<v Speaker 3>How did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are insurance companies?</v>

368
00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:33.723
<v Speaker 2>There was some lobbying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think I put this into the </v>

369
00:16:35.291 --> 00:16:36.124
<v Speaker 2>article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a lot of lobbying from </v>

370
00:16:37.391 --> 00:16:38.224
<v Speaker 2>chiropractors in I believe the seventies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pushed the American Medical </v>

371
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.353
<v Speaker 2>Association and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the insurance companies as a whole </v>

372
00:16:44.771 --> 00:16:49.090
<v Speaker 2>to kind of accept them as being </v>
<v Speaker 2>medically a part of the system.</v>

373
00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:49.924
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of why more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance companies now will cover them </v>

374
00:16:53.891 --> 00:16:57.790
<v Speaker 2>and accept them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even though like most doctors won't,</v>

375
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.330
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of doctors won't refer you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll kind of be like,</v>

376
00:17:01.331 --> 00:17:02.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look into Cairo.</v>

377
00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:06.900
<v Speaker 2>Like there's still from a lot of doctors</v>
<v Speaker 2>push back,</v>

378
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:07.853
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a little bit more coverage </v>

379
00:17:08.921 --> 00:17:10.960
<v Speaker 2>now just because of a lot of lobbying in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seventies</v>

380
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:16.160
<v Speaker 3>now have chiropractors do have a center </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a treatment center or whatever it is.</v>

381
00:17:16.531 --> 00:17:19.410
<v Speaker 3>And they have a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>methods that they employ.</v>

382
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.190
<v Speaker 3>This is not saying that those other </v>
<v Speaker 3>methods might not give you some relief,</v>

383
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.300
<v Speaker 3>but the actual cracking of the next and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cracking of the back,</v>

384
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.750
<v Speaker 3>there's virtually no evidence at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>heals anything.</v>

385
00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.613
<v Speaker 3>Or he stops and he promotes your immune </v>
<v Speaker 3>system functioning better or anything </v>

386
00:17:36.871 --> 00:17:39.180
<v Speaker 3>like that on all these things that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on.</v>

387
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.340
<v Speaker 2>It's precisely like the big thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

388
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they were just claiming we can reduce</v>

389
00:17:46.781 --> 00:17:48.940
<v Speaker 2>your back pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that was the only thing they claimed,</v>

390
00:17:48.941 --> 00:17:50.970
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have written the article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

391
00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:55.971
<v Speaker 2>but what they're claiming is that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can fix all of your health by realigning</v>

392
00:17:56.581 --> 00:18:00.810
<v Speaker 2>these vertebral subluxations which have </v>
<v Speaker 2>never been proven to exist.</v>

393
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:03.930
<v Speaker 2>So like what are you doing when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>back pops?</v>

394
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.580
<v Speaker 2>What is actually happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

395
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had intergen being released or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

396
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:08.754
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just moving around air </v>
<v Speaker 2>bubbles like enemy in tiny little bits </v>

397
00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:12.450
<v Speaker 2>of bubbles and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are like,</v>

398
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.343
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think realigning is the right </v>

399
00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:15.511
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

400
00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:16.840
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing their,</v>

401
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.723
<v Speaker 2>they're moving around your back in a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it kind of national news because </v>

402
00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:22.680
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of move and twist in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>back will pop.</v>

403
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.513
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing some manipulation of </v>

404
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:26.970
<v Speaker 2>things that kind of naturally happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

405
00:18:26.971 --> 00:18:28.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a spine,</v>

406
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:29.011
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

407
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:29.844
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a tiny little bit tiny bit of </v>

408
00:18:31.351 --> 00:18:34.080
<v Speaker 2>degeneration with age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm not exactly the right expert</v>

409
00:18:34.081 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 2>to explain this type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An osteopath would be a better person to</v>

410
00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:41.970
<v Speaker 2>explain this because there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people who are a little better</v>

411
00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:44.790
<v Speaker 2>at spinal manipulation than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chiropractor,</v>

412
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:45.624
<v Speaker 2>which is a dio and osteopaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in this country we have mds and dos </v>

413
00:18:49.621 --> 00:18:53.340
<v Speaker 2>and they both can practice medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor of osteopathy,</v>

414
00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.340
<v Speaker 2>a doctor of osteopathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's the correct term.</v>

415
00:18:56.341 --> 00:18:57.570
<v Speaker 2>And my doctor is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

416
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:58.110
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

417
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.800
<v Speaker 2>primary care is an osteopath and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>given me a spinal manipulation once,</v>

418
00:19:01.801 --> 00:19:04.590
<v Speaker 2>when my back was killing me and we had </v>
<v Speaker 2>no idea what it was.</v>

419
00:19:04.591 --> 00:19:09.090
<v Speaker 2>And it turned out I had a broken rib,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was not a good time to do a spinal</v>

420
00:19:09.091 --> 00:19:09.850
<v Speaker 2>manipulation.</v>

421
00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.120
<v Speaker 2>We've got a rib broken right on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>spine,</v>

422
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.460
<v Speaker 2>but it was like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

423
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.930
<v Speaker 2>the difference is an osteopath never </v>
<v Speaker 2>claimed that they're,</v>

424
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're cracking your back to try it.</v>

425
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

426
00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:23.130
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're giving you,</v>

427
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.680
<v Speaker 2>they're giving you your vaccines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing,</v>

428
00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:26.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going,</v>

429
00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:27.960
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with your,</v>

430
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:28.920
<v Speaker 2>with your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

431
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.870
<v Speaker 2>a we're going to send you to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gynecologist.</v>

432
00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:31.704
<v Speaker 2>Like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing all the things that </v>

433
00:19:32.641 --> 00:19:36.240
<v Speaker 2>doctors should do for your health and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>your back is in pain,</v>

434
00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:37.074
<v Speaker 2>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to try and make a </v>

435
00:19:37.651 --> 00:19:39.510
<v Speaker 2>manipulation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not pushing that,</v>

436
00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.580
<v Speaker 2>that's a part of their care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they try to do science based,</v>

437
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

438
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.840
<v Speaker 2>manipulations for the potential help of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

439
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.260
<v Speaker 2>of a back relief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know.</v>

440
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.610
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to do that longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do it minimally.</v>

441
00:19:53.611 --> 00:19:55.440
<v Speaker 2>At least that's been my experience with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

442
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.320
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

443
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.273
<v Speaker 2>There still seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say at best weak evidence that it </v>

444
00:20:01.081 --> 00:20:02.550
<v Speaker 2>helps with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

445
00:20:02.551 --> 00:20:03.740
<v Speaker 2>with back pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

446
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:07.380
<v Speaker 2>the problem is they usually do it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things that also has been shown to</v>

447
00:20:07.381 --> 00:20:09.390
<v Speaker 2>help with back pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

448
00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:11.160
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also just breast.</v>

449
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Breast ice,</v>

450
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.550
<v Speaker 2>antiinflammatories seeing all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different factors.</v>

451
00:20:16.551 --> 00:20:18.710
<v Speaker 2>And while I went to a chiropractor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he helped me.</v>

452
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I make,</v>

453
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.713
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's funny the things that </v>

454
00:20:23.301 --> 00:20:24.134
<v Speaker 2>chiropractors add into it because like </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I went into in </v>

455
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:26.900
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

456
00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.360
<v Speaker 2>in this article because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

457
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.440
<v Speaker 2>we really like diving deep on some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that we investigate.</v>

458
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like I try,</v>

459
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.943
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

460
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.060
<v Speaker 2>I'll admit I'm biased when I go in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

461
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.010
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go after a lot of kind of,</v>

462
00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.710
<v Speaker 2>some of the naturally things and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

463
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm not anti natural.</v>

464
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:42.863
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not 100 percent against going into </v>

465
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.400
<v Speaker 2>homeopathics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because we can,</v>

466
00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.030
<v Speaker 2>we can go into some of it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

467
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:49.864
<v Speaker 2>Like garlic really is good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>infections or some stuff that's </v>

468
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.950
<v Speaker 2>legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for your heart.</v>

469
00:20:53.951 --> 00:20:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Ginger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love when I have a stomach ache,</v>

470
00:20:55.661 --> 00:20:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I'll go for ginger before I go first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remedies that work.</v>

471
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.670
<v Speaker 2>There are some herbal remedies and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

472
00:21:00.671 --> 00:21:01.900
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep them in your,</v>

473
00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:04.450
<v Speaker 2>in your cabinet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not against them,</v>

474
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:07.660
<v Speaker 2>but I'm against people taking things </v>
<v Speaker 2>without evidence.</v>

475
00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:09.030
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like try,</v>

476
00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.620
<v Speaker 2>try absolutely it to look for the hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence,</v>

477
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you waste your money.</v>

478
00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:16.180
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the thing that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have fallen into because they'll say,</v>

479
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:16.991
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's natural,</v>

480
00:21:16.991 --> 00:21:17.824
<v Speaker 2>it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

481
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.490
<v Speaker 2>because polio is natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's very good for you,</v>

482
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:22.141
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

483
00:21:22.141 --> 00:21:23.470
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's a straw man,</v>

484
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.520
<v Speaker 2>fully aware of it.</v>

485
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:25.623
<v Speaker 2>But I also think that people should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should ask for evidence and you never </v>

486
00:21:28.451 --> 00:21:29.284
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asked for it to manned it before you </v>

487
00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:33.790
<v Speaker 2>give somebody your money and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>people haven't done with chiropractors.</v>

488
00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:35.950
<v Speaker 2>And that is the very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

489
00:21:35.951 --> 00:21:36.784
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people deserve evidence and </v>

490
00:21:38.441 --> 00:21:40.480
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's something that hasn't</v>

491
00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:41.314
<v Speaker 2>been out in the public sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was an article I was trying </v>

492
00:21:43.271 --> 00:21:44.760
<v Speaker 2>to write a while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

493
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.930
<v Speaker 2>I forget the exact topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of my editors,</v>

494
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

495
00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.210
<v Speaker 2>sending it back to me credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

496
00:21:49.211 --> 00:21:50.330
<v Speaker 2>I've read that she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

497
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.730
<v Speaker 2>her comment back was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

498
00:21:51.731 --> 00:21:54.360
<v Speaker 2>I've been reading this a lot online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have been saying this.</v>

499
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:55.203
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people have been saying is not </v>

500
00:21:56.681 --> 00:21:59.290
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the exact opposite of it.</v>

501
00:21:59.291 --> 00:22:00.011
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

502
00:22:00.011 --> 00:22:04.720
<v Speaker 2>I put in the peer review data on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet or I didn't work with her again.</v>

503
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.030
<v Speaker 2>She was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have been saying,</v>

504
00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.740
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not.</v>

505
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.990
<v Speaker 2>That's the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is why I liked the editor,</v>

506
00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:14.440
<v Speaker 2>so I'm working with now quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with this whole clinic thing</v>

507
00:22:14.441 --> 00:22:19.441
<v Speaker 2>though is that they don't have to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>any sort of background in kinesiology or</v>

508
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:24.430
<v Speaker 2>in physical therapy or any of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and so they incorporate all these</v>

509
00:22:24.431 --> 00:22:26.710
<v Speaker 2>other modalities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these other methods of healing you,</v>

510
00:22:26.711 --> 00:22:30.340
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have to have a background</v>
<v Speaker 2>in education in those things and they're</v>

511
00:22:30.341 --> 00:22:31.760
<v Speaker 2>calling themselves a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

512
00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.430
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is one thing I've heard of,</v>

513
00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:34.264
<v Speaker 2>and this isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why I'd say don't go to a </v>

514
00:22:35.891 --> 00:22:39.400
<v Speaker 2>chiropractor because we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what you're going to walk</v>

515
00:22:39.401 --> 00:22:40.234
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have heard a couple of cases of </v>

516
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:43.294
<v Speaker 2>times this being the case where a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chiropractor at first they go to school </v>

517
00:22:46.061 --> 00:22:49.420
<v Speaker 2>for physical therapy and then they find </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't open their own clinic.</v>

518
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Even if they've got like an MBA and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical therapy background.</v>

519
00:22:52.721 --> 00:22:54.340
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I open my own clinic?</v>

520
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.280
<v Speaker 2>And they realize if they just go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>school for Chiropractic,</v>

521
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.233
<v Speaker 2>they can do the physical therapy work </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to and offer a spinal </v>

522
00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:02.164
<v Speaker 2>manipulation on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now how long does it take to get a </v>

523
00:23:03.731 --> 00:23:06.510
<v Speaker 2>degree in Chiropractic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty three,</v>

524
00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.870
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four years.</v>

525
00:23:07.871 --> 00:23:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a lot of school,</v>

526
00:23:09.251 --> 00:23:11.560
<v Speaker 2>but think about a learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

527
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.230
<v Speaker 2>had a crack spines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the thing that I think created by</v>

528
00:23:14.231 --> 00:23:15.064
<v Speaker 2>a guy who's a quack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck could they possibly be </v>

529
00:23:16.931 --> 00:23:19.380
<v Speaker 2>teaching you for four years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

530
00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.253
<v Speaker 2>They do learn some anatomy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like they also learned some </v>

531
00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.520
<v Speaker 2>bullshit along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

532
00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:26.320
<v Speaker 2>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean this isn't.</v>

533
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.110
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't all chiropractor's obviously,</v>

534
00:23:29.111 --> 00:23:29.944
<v Speaker 2>but like I know it's hard to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>which one you're going to walk into </v>

535
00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:36.430
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be a bullshit artist and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so like I,</v>

536
00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:37.483
<v Speaker 2>I did want it like this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this wasn't the point I was going to </v>

537
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:41.590
<v Speaker 2>bring up in an article that was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a specific point of view,</v>

538
00:23:41.591 --> 00:23:44.320
<v Speaker 2>but like I know there are some out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>that say I,</v>

539
00:23:44.321 --> 00:23:46.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I to give people physical therapy,</v>

540
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:47.714
<v Speaker 2>I want to strengthen up their spine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get them out of here in less </v>

541
00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:53.120
<v Speaker 2>pain so that if they injure themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

542
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.133
<v Speaker 2>they know they can come back to me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trust me with their spine and also give </v>

543
00:23:56.961 --> 00:23:59.480
<v Speaker 2>them some relief while we're fixing </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

544
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.021
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

545
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:02.270
<v Speaker 2>this is a thing that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's all the time.</v>

546
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.220
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's clearly not all the time.</v>

547
00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:05.054
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have some really moral </v>

548
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:09.650
<v Speaker 2>people in every field and you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>have some really fucked up once in every</v>

549
00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:10.970
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we were.</v>

550
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.013
<v Speaker 2>One of the things we touched on in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>article were these very social media </v>

551
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:16.214
<v Speaker 2>savvy people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that drives me </v>

552
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.433
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to hunt and peck through their </v>

553
00:24:20.391 --> 00:24:22.760
<v Speaker 2>websites to find that they say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a chiropractor.</v>

554
00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:25.580
<v Speaker 2>They just say doctor everywhere Dr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're giving.</v>

555
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.593
<v Speaker 2>They're giving recipe ideas and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving and they're talking about the </v>

556
00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:29.864
<v Speaker 2>adrenal glands and the adrenal glands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not anywhere near close to the </v>

557
00:24:32.841 --> 00:24:35.330
<v Speaker 2>spine and this is the thing that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

558
00:24:35.331 --> 00:24:36.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the adrenal glands are,</v>

559
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.513
<v Speaker 2>they're part of talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulating the spine to help the </v>

560
00:24:39.501 --> 00:24:40.130
<v Speaker 2>adrenal glands.</v>

561
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.963
<v Speaker 2>They're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things they talk about a lot </v>

562
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:43.334
<v Speaker 2>is adrenal fatigue syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has never been proven to be a </v>

563
00:24:46.311 --> 00:24:48.950
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not recognized as a,</v>

564
00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:52.070
<v Speaker 2>as a disorder anywhere within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical care system.</v>

565
00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Now you can have a couple of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorders of the adrenal gland.</v>

566
00:24:55.881 --> 00:24:58.070
<v Speaker 2>You have cushing's syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

567
00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:59.343
<v Speaker 2>have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a couple of different things </v>

568
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:00.764
<v Speaker 2>that can go wrong with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your adrenal glands are a little glands </v>

569
00:25:02.541 --> 00:25:04.160
<v Speaker 2>that sit on top of the kidneys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

570
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:08.170
<v Speaker 2>but this is the specialty I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second,</v>

571
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.950
<v Speaker 2>having a blonde moment on the words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

572
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.260
<v Speaker 2>but like there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sub specialty,</v>

573
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:16.220
<v Speaker 2>but the specialty for which you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to study the adrenal glands isn't even a</v>

574
00:25:16.221 --> 00:25:17.054
<v Speaker 2>specialty that chiropractic has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like if you want to know about </v>

575
00:25:20.481 --> 00:25:21.880
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're having issues with that,</v>

576
00:25:21.881 --> 00:25:22.714
<v Speaker 2>like it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that chiropractor seem to </v>

577
00:25:25.401 --> 00:25:27.050
<v Speaker 2>harp on right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a lot with,</v>

578
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immunology or a lot with,</v>

579
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:30.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

580
00:25:30.291 --> 00:25:32.150
<v Speaker 2>just having a complete blonde moment on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

581
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>

582
00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:34.043
<v Speaker 2>there are specialties at chiropractor </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to harp on a lot lately and it </v>

583
00:25:36.981 --> 00:25:40.220
<v Speaker 2>seems to be the types of things that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>very nebulous and very hard to,</v>

584
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:41.383
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to nail down when someone's having an </v>

585
00:25:42.351 --> 00:25:43.910
<v Speaker 2>issue with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these are,</v>

586
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.910
<v Speaker 2>these are things that chiropractors just</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have the training in.</v>

587
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.903
<v Speaker 2>So essentially someone's putting up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>health website and they're claiming to </v>

588
00:25:51.141 --> 00:25:51.974
<v Speaker 2>be a doctor and they're offering all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this advice on diet and all these </v>

589
00:25:54.701 --> 00:25:57.950
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you get to what is their degree</v>

590
00:25:57.951 --> 00:25:58.910
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

591
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not a real doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a chiropractor and it's,</v>

592
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.023
<v Speaker 2>and they're basically all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the type of advice they're </v>

593
00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:06.800
<v Speaker 2>giving is take all these herbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat a,</v>

594
00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:08.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating an alkaline diet,</v>

595
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.700
<v Speaker 2>which is again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

596
00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

597
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.333
<v Speaker 2>there's one of my favorite things with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the alkaline diet is they're always </v>

598
00:26:15.351 --> 00:26:16.430
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink lemon water.</v>

599
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:17.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's acidic,</v>

600
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.390
<v Speaker 2>which I might know from my chemistry </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>

601
00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:21.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the premise of this alkaline </v>

602
00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:23.564
<v Speaker 2>diet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I remember people were pushing </v>

603
00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.373
<v Speaker 2>that awhile back saying that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>cure cancer and shit just by having a </v>

604
00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:33.040
<v Speaker 2>diet that's alkaline sort of acidic it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

605
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the premise of it.</v>

606
00:26:34.731 --> 00:26:35.720
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like they,</v>

607
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.830
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>

608
00:26:36.831 --> 00:26:39.590
<v Speaker 2>your body's Ph is really tightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled.</v>

609
00:26:39.591 --> 00:26:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Like your blood is between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think seven point three,</v>

610
00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:43.530
<v Speaker 2>five and seven point five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>

611
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.543
<v Speaker 2>A different organ systems have a fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>tightly controlled ph of your urine can </v>

612
00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:51.330
<v Speaker 2>vary a little bit depending on what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've consumed.</v>

613
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:52.770
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

614
00:26:52.771 --> 00:26:55.170
<v Speaker 2>there's a tightly controlled Ph within </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

615
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.660
<v Speaker 2>If you're suddenly go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

616
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.450
<v Speaker 2>if suddenly you have a Ph of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

617
00:27:00.451 --> 00:27:01.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly alkaline,</v>

618
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.000
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

619
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.760
<v Speaker 2>your friends are your friends are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to miss you at your funeral,</v>

620
00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:06.560
<v Speaker 2>hopefully.</v>

621
00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

622
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:10.560
<v Speaker 2>that's what I got on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like she didn't have a high ph.</v>

623
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.590
<v Speaker 2>you're dead if you're suddenly because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that's a,</v>

624
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.080
<v Speaker 2>that's an alkaline ph.</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're suddenly really,</v>

625
00:27:16.081 --> 00:27:18.990
<v Speaker 2>really alkaline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna miss you.</v>

626
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:24.320
<v Speaker 2>That's someone to be that alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking a bunch of lie.</v>

627
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

628
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.290
<v Speaker 2>don't do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're like,</v>

629
00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:29.124
<v Speaker 2>there's something really wrong with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to filter things out of your </v>

630
00:27:31.891 --> 00:27:34.320
<v Speaker 2>body if you're suddenly like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>

631
00:27:34.321 --> 00:27:36.810
<v Speaker 2>it's just not a thing that happens to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy human.</v>

632
00:27:36.811 --> 00:27:38.730
<v Speaker 2>If you're all of a sudden really </v>
<v Speaker 2>alkaline,</v>

633
00:27:38.731 --> 00:27:39.564
<v Speaker 2>but this diet won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when the things that they're </v>

634
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:44.930
<v Speaker 2>recommending are like lemons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

635
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.560
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things they say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

636
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:50.100
<v Speaker 2>well your body takes that acidic fruit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and turned it alkaline.</v>

637
00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:51.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the,</v>

638
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.430
<v Speaker 1>where are they coming up with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>

639
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:58.810
<v Speaker 1>This is just nonsense that someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just repeating online and there.</v>

640
00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the things I say like the,</v>

641
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:04.010
<v Speaker 2>the Diet they've designed is a fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>low calorie diet.</v>

642
00:28:04.011 --> 00:28:04.844
<v Speaker 2>Like it'll make you lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not going to make you go </v>

643
00:28:06.171 --> 00:28:08.630
<v Speaker 2>alkaline and it's not going to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight cancer.</v>

644
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:09.763
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

645
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.660
<v Speaker 1>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reduction in calories or probably be</v>

646
00:28:12.661 --> 00:28:16.320
<v Speaker 1>good because you lose some body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have less inflammation</v>

647
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.421
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

648
00:28:17.421 --> 00:28:18.500
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

649
00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.880
<v Speaker 2>there have been shown to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

650
00:28:19.881 --> 00:28:21.260
<v Speaker 2>links between lower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

651
00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:24.950
<v Speaker 2>lower body fat and lower incidences of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>

652
00:28:24.951 --> 00:28:25.431
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

653
00:28:25.431 --> 00:28:27.740
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Losing weight if you're,</v>

654
00:28:27.741 --> 00:28:28.574
<v Speaker 2>if you're overweight and you're having </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical problems from it overall good </v>

655
00:28:30.921 --> 00:28:32.540
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is no,</v>

656
00:28:32.541 --> 00:28:34.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shown a link between,</v>

657
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.083
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between this specific diet and a lower </v>

658
00:28:38.331 --> 00:28:40.940
<v Speaker 2>incidence of cancer or any other </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorders.</v>

659
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.030
<v Speaker 2>But it's just like</v>

660
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.810
<v Speaker 1>so fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of those things.</v>

661
00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.490
<v Speaker 1>I remember when people were wearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

662
00:28:46.491 --> 00:28:47.324
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holograms attached to a rubber band </v>

691
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.680
<v Speaker 1>But hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that NASA is right.</v>

692
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron man science.</v>

693
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.373
<v Speaker 1>It says Gwyneth paltrow's goop website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lifestyle business lifestyle which </v>

694
00:30:23.411 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 1>sells all things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gwyneth advertise.</v>

695
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.630
<v Speaker 1>These stickers are using NASA space suit</v>
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>

696
00:30:28.631 --> 00:30:31.780
<v Speaker 1>which presumably was the source of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>magic healing properties.</v>

697
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Jesus fucking Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's special stickers have not made.</v>

698
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:40.900
<v Speaker 1>This is what NASA says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not made of space suit material,</v>

699
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:41.883
<v Speaker 1>not that space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New suit material that has healing </v>

700
00:30:43.001 --> 00:30:44.440
<v Speaker 1>properties in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

701
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.690
<v Speaker 1>but the quote from the foreign NASA </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>

702
00:30:46.691 --> 00:30:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Mark Shoal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shell Shell,</v>

703
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Shell Hummer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shelmar Shalimar sums it up.</v>

704
00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.200
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

705
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.830
<v Speaker 1>what a load of bs this is or that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

706
00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.170
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's obviously goop.</v>

707
00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Quickly updated its site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it doesn't claim anything about NASA</v>

708
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:02.224
<v Speaker 1>space suits and stickers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't dial back in in the </v>

709
00:31:04.331 --> 00:31:07.600
<v Speaker 1>magical healing claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what groups has now in an article</v>

710
00:31:07.601 --> 00:31:11.380
<v Speaker 1>called wearable stickers that promote </v>
<v Speaker 1>healing in parentheses.</v>

711
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.333
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fuck human bodies operate at an </v>

712
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.190
<v Speaker 1>ideal energetic frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyday stresses and anxiety.</v>

713
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.680
<v Speaker 1>You give me stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bitch.</v>

714
00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.773
<v Speaker 1>You can throw off our internal balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depleting our energy reserves and </v>

715
00:31:27.341 --> 00:31:28.174
<v Speaker 1>weakening our immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking imagine thinking that you </v>

716
00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:32.170
<v Speaker 1>could put a sticker on you and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to heal you.</v>

717
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Body vibe stickers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

718
00:31:33.911 --> 00:31:35.930
<v Speaker 1>They're called body vibes coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pre-Pro.</v>

719
00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:37.720
<v Speaker 1>They come preprogrammed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

720
00:31:37.721 --> 00:31:38.860
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The programming.</v>

721
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.920
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To an ideal frequency,</v>

722
00:31:41.921 --> 00:31:45.910
<v Speaker 1>allowing them to target imbalances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You motherfucker,</v>

723
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.940
<v Speaker 1>you fucking crook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you have enough money,</v>

724
00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:50.800
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

725
00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:54.550
<v Speaker 1>The residuals on the iron man movies </v>
<v Speaker 1>just weren't enough for her.</v>

726
00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.060
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 bucks for a 10 pack.</v>

727
00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Hold Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 stickers for 60 bucks.</v>

728
00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the wrong industry.</v>

729
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:06.063
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to start selling some fancy </v>

730
00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:08.740
<v Speaker 1>motherfucking stickers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

731
00:32:08.741 --> 00:32:09.574
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

732
00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:10.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>

733
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:14.590
<v Speaker 1>this is a very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very controversial subject,</v>

734
00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:15.453
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like anything that's not regulated by </v>

735
00:32:17.351 --> 00:32:18.850
<v Speaker 1>the FDA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

736
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:21.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm a part of a in interest of full </v>
<v Speaker 1>disclosure,</v>

737
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.170
<v Speaker 1>part of the company on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

738
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:26.110
<v Speaker 1>we sell supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the supplements that we sell,</v>

739
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:29.680
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we control everything that we sell,</v>

740
00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:31.960
<v Speaker 1>so we make sure that we do testing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

741
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.730
<v Speaker 1>The supplements that we sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this shit.</v>

742
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.593
<v Speaker 1>A Alpha brain did do d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two double blind placebo controlled </v>

743
00:32:37.001 --> 00:32:37.834
<v Speaker 1>studies at Boston Center for memory that</v>
<v Speaker 1>showed increase in verbal memory </v>

744
00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:43.150
<v Speaker 1>increase in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

745
00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:47.060
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the other one?</v>

746
00:32:47.061 --> 00:32:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a reaction time,</v>

747
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:50.563
<v Speaker 1>but there's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actual scientific studies on </v>

748
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:54.560
<v Speaker 1>nootropics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been around for a long time.</v>

749
00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:56.330
<v Speaker 1>The nutrients about them just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've,</v>

750
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.150
<v Speaker 1>I haven't looked into them enough and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

751
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I know they're kind of their new ish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

752
00:33:01.581 --> 00:33:04.310
<v Speaker 1>into the supplement market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I kind of want to look into them</v>

753
00:33:04.311 --> 00:33:05.144
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know enough to comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially the building blocks for </v>

754
00:33:07.401 --> 00:33:09.650
<v Speaker 1>human neurotransmitters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which your body uses,</v>

755
00:33:09.651 --> 00:33:12.060
<v Speaker 1>the nutrients your body uses to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>human neurotransmitters.</v>

756
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.090
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing woo woo about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing crazy.</v>

757
00:33:14.091 --> 00:33:17.420
<v Speaker 1>It's all backed by science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we started putting them out,</v>

758
00:33:17.421 --> 00:33:19.490
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>claiming bullshit.</v>

759
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 1>You're selling snake oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we had a control these studies and we</v>

760
00:33:23.451 --> 00:33:27.650
<v Speaker 1>had to pay for them at the Boston Center</v>
<v Speaker 1>for memory and put.</v>

761
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.750
<v Speaker 1>We also had to make sure that we put a </v>
<v Speaker 1>full 100 percent money back guarantee on</v>

762
00:33:32.751 --> 00:33:35.720
<v Speaker 1>any of the supplements where you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to return them.</v>

763
00:33:35.721 --> 00:33:36.554
<v Speaker 1>Just say they didn't work for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you will try and make it as clean </v>

764
00:33:38.901 --> 00:33:40.580
<v Speaker 1>as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is stuff that I use,</v>

765
00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:44.870
<v Speaker 1>I find benefit in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what people think about it and</v>

766
00:33:44.871 --> 00:33:49.490
<v Speaker 1>let's make sure that we have studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you sell things like stickers,</v>

767
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.920
<v Speaker 1>like there's no fucking studies on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stickers.</v>

768
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Said like when she was on a camel a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago and he was like,</v>

769
00:33:56.061 --> 00:33:57.830
<v Speaker 1>so how does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually just came out and said,</v>

770
00:33:57.831 --> 00:33:59.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how any of this shit works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

771
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.823
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're selling rocks for your </v>

772
00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:02.630
<v Speaker 1>pulse.</v>

773
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:03.463
<v Speaker 1>Does she have somebody else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make me and they're just </v>

774
00:34:04.701 --> 00:34:05.534
<v Speaker 1>unscrupulous and she's a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a CEO and she's apparently in all </v>

775
00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:12.920
<v Speaker 1>the meetings when she just busy reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's reading scripts and shit.</v>

776
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Look at this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

777
00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antianxiety unicorn skin at the beach.</v>

778
00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

779
00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of each vibe.</v>

780
00:34:21.591 --> 00:34:23.750
<v Speaker 1>One of the vibes of the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chill.</v>

781
00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.970
<v Speaker 1>That's what the preprogrammed chilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

782
00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.850
<v Speaker 1>For self love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is chilled for UNICORNS.</v>

783
00:34:29.851 --> 00:34:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real love.</v>

784
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I demand an orgasm within three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it works that way.</v>

785
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All.</v>

786
00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't just feeling good about </v>

787
00:34:37.551 --> 00:34:39.810
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't Gaillard rock rocked out,</v>

788
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.510
<v Speaker 1>but these things are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

789
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:44.803
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm not a big fan of the </v>

790
00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:47.984
<v Speaker 1>government stepping in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulating everything because I know </v>

791
00:34:51.771 --> 00:34:55.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of supplements that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually do work and for them to be,</v>

792
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:56.323
<v Speaker 1>to get passed by the FDA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to go through these exhaustive </v>

793
00:34:59.631 --> 00:35:00.464
<v Speaker 1>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cost hundreds of thousands of </v>

794
00:35:01.881 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge thing.</v>

795
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:05.450
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the.</v>

796
00:35:05.451 --> 00:35:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that like the reason why I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fan,</v>

797
00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:08.423
<v Speaker 2>I have at least some amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>government regulation on supplements is </v>

798
00:35:11.401 --> 00:35:12.234
<v Speaker 2>to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unscrew a very unscrupulous claims </v>

799
00:35:14.101 --> 00:35:17.520
<v Speaker 2>because especially with some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement industry,</v>

800
00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:19.590
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are claims that these are,</v>

801
00:35:19.591 --> 00:35:20.424
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are certain things on or </v>

802
00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:25.590
<v Speaker 2>sorry in a package and after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

803
00:35:25.591 --> 00:35:28.860
<v Speaker 2>some independent testing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find that some of the,</v>

804
00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some packages don't have what they claim</v>

805
00:35:31.891 --> 00:35:32.870
<v Speaker 2>in their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some,</v>

806
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.983
<v Speaker 2>it was something like a third of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement packages didn't have any of </v>

807
00:35:37.321 --> 00:35:39.180
<v Speaker 2>the ingredients in there or they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>less of it.</v>

808
00:35:39.181 --> 00:35:41.820
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not good for the consumer.</v>

809
00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:44.520
<v Speaker 2>So I wish there was a way to regulate it</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit better.</v>

810
00:35:44.521 --> 00:35:45.050
<v Speaker 2>At least</v>

811
00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:46.520
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think it should be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

812
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:47.383
<v Speaker 3>I think there should be like some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of an independent company that works in </v>

813
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:57.550
<v Speaker 3>a very scientific way where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can hire them to test your stuff and</v>

814
00:35:58.251 --> 00:35:59.084
<v Speaker 3>run these tests where you can show </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be some way to show that </v>

815
00:36:03.081 --> 00:36:08.081
<v Speaker 3>there's no collusion and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>bribery that everything's above board.</v>

816
00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:12.170
<v Speaker 3>But I dunno what the fuck that would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how that would be.</v>

817
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:13.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure how it would work.</v>

818
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:17.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like I know the FDA has </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

819
00:36:17.011 --> 00:36:20.220
<v Speaker 2>I know that drug approval definitely has</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

820
00:36:20.221 --> 00:36:22.200
<v Speaker 2>Like there have been drugs that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been passed that have had issues,</v>

821
00:36:22.201 --> 00:36:23.034
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

822
00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.550
<v Speaker 3>the fentanyl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all you need to know.</v>

823
00:36:24.551 --> 00:36:25.384
<v Speaker 3>They saw oxycontin and fentanyl and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are prescribing shit that takes </v>

824
00:36:28.331 --> 00:36:32.020
<v Speaker 3>forever for people to get off a massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>addiction rates.</v>

825
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.720
<v Speaker 2>Things like fentanyl have some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some very limited purpose.</v>

826
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:39.220
<v Speaker 2>Just like I've been put on fentanyl for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a pre surgery before.</v>

827
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.133
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

828
00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.520
<v Speaker 2>they put you on it just to put you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get this check.</v>

829
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:43.363
<v Speaker 2>Highs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember about 30 seconds and I was </v>

830
00:36:46.121 --> 00:36:48.550
<v Speaker 2>told I threw up a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was under.</v>

831
00:36:48.551 --> 00:36:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't remember.</v>

832
00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I know that I can't have fentanyl,</v>

833
00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

834
00:36:53.201 --> 00:36:55.420
<v Speaker 2>they just put you on to put you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's like,</v>

835
00:36:55.421 --> 00:36:58.840
<v Speaker 2>that's one of very few ethical </v>
<v Speaker 2>applications of,</v>

836
00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.220
<v Speaker 2>of fentanyl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

837
00:37:00.221 --> 00:37:01.054
<v Speaker 2>it depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I did my master's thesis on </v>

838
00:37:03.041 --> 00:37:05.560
<v Speaker 2>prescription opioid abuse trends and </v>
<v Speaker 2>toxicology.</v>

839
00:37:05.561 --> 00:37:06.394
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a spirit that I know pretty </v>

840
00:37:07.391 --> 00:37:07.930
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

841
00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:08.763
<v Speaker 2>but this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of one of the things with </v>

842
00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:11.913
<v Speaker 2>painkillers is that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are ethical prescribing practice </v>

843
00:37:14.531 --> 00:37:15.364
<v Speaker 2>with their ethical ways to manage a </v>
<v Speaker 2>patient use of it and then they're </v>

844
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:24.880
<v Speaker 2>really horribly unethical ways that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be prescribed and managed over time.</v>

845
00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:27.910
<v Speaker 2>And this is something that the FDA </v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't managed well.</v>

846
00:37:27.911 --> 00:37:31.330
<v Speaker 2>This is something that a lot of doctors </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't managed well and it's like we,</v>

847
00:37:31.331 --> 00:37:32.164
<v Speaker 2>I mean we started this when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were like let's go on a </v>

848
00:37:34.751 --> 00:37:35.584
<v Speaker 2>marketing campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bureaucracy gone down and it just kept </v>

849
00:37:38.171 --> 00:37:41.370
<v Speaker 2>getting worse from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like there's,</v>

850
00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:42.993
<v Speaker 2>there has to be a better way to manage </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing right now with it and </v>

851
00:37:45.611 --> 00:37:47.410
<v Speaker 2>it's not being done yet.</v>

852
00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:50.430
<v Speaker 3>So obviously this has nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gwyneth paltrow goop,</v>

853
00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.313
<v Speaker 3>but I just think that they're some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of an independent company or some sort </v>

854
00:37:54.731 --> 00:37:55.450
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

855
00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.400
<v Speaker 3>naughty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep saying business,</v>

856
00:37:57.401 --> 00:37:58.234
<v Speaker 3>but there's so many problems with doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and there's also problems with </v>

857
00:38:00.641 --> 00:38:01.474
<v Speaker 3>having the government do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think they'd been adequate </v>

858
00:38:02.801 --> 00:38:07.801
<v Speaker 3>so far and the FDA stepping in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>regulating all vitamins and,</v>

859
00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:09.730
<v Speaker 3>and making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

860
00:38:09.731 --> 00:38:12.520
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to do that for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to call them nutraceuticals.</v>

861
00:38:12.521 --> 00:38:13.600
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

862
00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.740
<v Speaker 3>to have prescriptions for vitamins and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines.</v>

863
00:38:17.741 --> 00:38:18.574
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with that is I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to have to go to the doctor to get </v>

864
00:38:20.471 --> 00:38:21.304
<v Speaker 3>multivitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do want to make sure that the </v>

865
00:38:22.691 --> 00:38:24.970
<v Speaker 3>multivitamins that I get are pure or </v>
<v Speaker 3>safe,</v>

866
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.330
<v Speaker 3>not just safe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that what you're asking for,</v>

867
00:38:28.331 --> 00:38:30.700
<v Speaker 3>are you looking for be 12?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make sure I'm getting be 12.</v>

868
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:32.123
<v Speaker 2>The other question is how much of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin D you need and I think that buy </v>

869
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:37.204
<v Speaker 2>vitamins indiscriminately because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>really don't like the average person </v>

870
00:38:39.701 --> 00:38:42.220
<v Speaker 2>doesn't need to take a multivitamin in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the day if they're eating,</v>

871
00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:43.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a healthy diet because you get pretty </v>

872
00:38:44.981 --> 00:38:45.814
<v Speaker 2>much what you need on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not somebody with an </v>

873
00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:50.390
<v Speaker 2>absorption issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not somebody with a,</v>

874
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:51.303
<v Speaker 2>any like any dietary issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're generally getting what you need </v>

875
00:38:53.951 --> 00:38:55.220
<v Speaker 2>out of your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

876
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:58.000
<v Speaker 2>I think people do need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your diet is really healthy,</v>

877
00:38:58.001 --> 00:38:58.834
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But most people do not have a really </v>

878
00:39:00.161 --> 00:39:00.994
<v Speaker 2>healthy diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people are getting about what they </v>

879
00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:05.530
<v Speaker 2>need out of their diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people seriously,</v>

880
00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:06.973
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if we have some of the poorest </v>

881
00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 2>people are just eating processed </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

882
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.033
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's even if you go to the doctor and </v>

883
00:39:13.001 --> 00:39:15.910
<v Speaker 2>get an average person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing you eat fairly healthy,</v>

884
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:17.543
<v Speaker 2>but the average person that they go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the doctor to see if they're deficient </v>

885
00:39:19.721 --> 00:39:20.950
<v Speaker 2>on everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on anything,</v>

886
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.350
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be deficient.</v>

887
00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:25.870
<v Speaker 2>I've gone and gotten my blood work done </v>
<v Speaker 2>several times.</v>

888
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:30.200
<v Speaker 2>Deficiencies and deficiencies in Vitamin</v>
<v Speaker 2>D.</v>

889
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:30.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

890
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:31.533
<v Speaker 2>I've been before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was right when I was diagnosed </v>

891
00:39:32.681 --> 00:39:34.300
<v Speaker 2>with CELIAC disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was,</v>

892
00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I was deficient at a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

893
00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:38.254
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an issue with wheat and you have </v>

894
00:39:39.511 --> 00:39:41.400
<v Speaker 2>an issue absorbing food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

895
00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 2>So I mean now it will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that I've been,</v>

896
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.260
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

897
00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:45.373
<v Speaker 2>I was at the skinniest point in my life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I stopped eating wheat and I </v>

898
00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:50.410
<v Speaker 2>gained weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because suddenly you're,</v>

899
00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.790
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

900
00:39:51.791 --> 00:39:52.624
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they heal and you're able to absorb </v>

901
00:39:54.611 --> 00:39:55.380
<v Speaker 2>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again.</v>

902
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.213
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who's got a son who they</v>
<v Speaker 2>was trying to figure out why he was so </v>

903
00:39:58.661 --> 00:39:59.730
<v Speaker 2>small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

904
00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:02.500
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't eat and he was never hungry </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was eating,</v>

905
00:40:02.501 --> 00:40:03.334
<v Speaker 2>you might get sick here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is miserable and he's got a </v>

906
00:40:05.951 --> 00:40:07.290
<v Speaker 2>wheat allergy.</v>

907
00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.380
<v Speaker 2>He's got a corn allergy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

908
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.110
<v Speaker 2>everything was just making him </v>
<v Speaker 2>miserable.</v>

909
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got quote unquote lucky.</v>

910
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I only got symptoms when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>adults.</v>

911
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>

912
00:40:17.351 --> 00:40:18.184
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ate wheat all throughout your </v>

913
00:40:19.331 --> 00:40:20.590
<v Speaker 2>childhood years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem,</v>

914
00:40:20.591 --> 00:40:23.340
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I was even overweight as,</v>

915
00:40:23.341 --> 00:40:25.690
<v Speaker 2>as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then when I was an adult,</v>

916
00:40:25.691 --> 00:40:29.470
<v Speaker 2>suddenly horrible symptoms showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't work.</v>

917
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.160
<v Speaker 2>What do they have an idea of a celiac </v>
<v Speaker 2>can show up,</v>

918
00:40:33.161 --> 00:40:34.110
<v Speaker 2>are the symptoms of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can,</v>

919
00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:38.300
<v Speaker 2>like you always have the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 2>physiology or um,</v>

920
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.153
<v Speaker 2>and just all of a sudden symptoms can </v>
<v Speaker 2>just show up out of the blue line </v>

921
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:43.380
<v Speaker 2>dormant and then all of a sudden it </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes active.</v>

922
00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.993
<v Speaker 2>I had a bunch of health decisions </v>
<v Speaker 2>because to kind of show up in my </v>

923
00:40:46.391 --> 00:40:48.470
<v Speaker 2>twenties and I mean I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like alright,</v>

924
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:49.960
<v Speaker 2>I got to start taking care of myself.</v>

925
00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.120
<v Speaker 2>Started going to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>run a few marathons,</v>

926
00:40:52.121 --> 00:40:55.780
<v Speaker 2>lost a lot of weight and like even when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was suddenly at a healthy weight,</v>

927
00:40:55.781 --> 00:40:59.510
<v Speaker 2>it was like I couldn't stop losing </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight because my mate,</v>

928
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.840
<v Speaker 2>my intestines just weren't absorbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

929
00:41:01.841 --> 00:41:02.674
<v Speaker 2>And that's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a thing you see coming or </v>

930
00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:07.420
<v Speaker 2>like I'm at a healthy wise and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopping and it was,</v>

931
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:08.890
<v Speaker 2>it was not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

932
00:41:08.891 --> 00:41:11.230
<v Speaker 2>eventually it was funny because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gluten trend,</v>

933
00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.680
<v Speaker 2>how or the anti gluten trend had already</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed up and a doctor suggested to me,</v>

934
00:41:14.681 --> 00:41:17.230
<v Speaker 2>well have you tried going gluten free?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

935
00:41:17.231 --> 00:41:21.340
<v Speaker 2>oh that's a silly fad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three months later diagnosed with CELIAC</v>

936
00:41:21.341 --> 00:41:21.941
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

937
00:41:21.941 --> 00:41:24.160
<v Speaker 2>if I hadn't been so skeptical of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

938
00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.013
<v Speaker 2>think gluten free is a fad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think gluten is the best thing </v>

939
00:41:27.281 --> 00:41:29.980
<v Speaker 2>for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay every now and then,</v>

940
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:34.310
<v Speaker 2>but I think that essentially what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting when you're processed grains</v>

941
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:36.180
<v Speaker 3>is you're getting something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body's kind.</v>

942
00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:37.143
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of alien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bondo doesn't exactly know what to </v>

943
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:38.730
<v Speaker 3>do with it.</v>

944
00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there doesn't seem.</v>

945
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:41.460
<v Speaker 2>Here's things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tests keeps showing.</v>

946
00:41:41.461 --> 00:41:43.620
<v Speaker 2>There doesn't seem to be a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>gluten.</v>

947
00:41:43.621 --> 00:41:45.980
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have celiac disease and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

948
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:49.470
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean by a problem?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it like for optimizing your health?</v>

949
00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.410
<v Speaker 3>Is it something that you should have in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your diet all the time,</v>

950
00:41:52.411 --> 00:41:55.580
<v Speaker 3>or is it something that mean it really </v>
<v Speaker 3>does convert to sugar.</v>

951
00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:57.603
<v Speaker 2>Everything converts to sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body converts everything in some </v>

952
00:42:00.521 --> 00:42:02.440
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form into usable fuel,</v>

953
00:42:02.441 --> 00:42:06.230
<v Speaker 2>and the usable fuel is eventually </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose or Nad Ph.</v>

954
00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.353
<v Speaker 2>there's everything in your body gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>converted to sugar when you use do you </v>

955
00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:10.990
<v Speaker 2>feel,</v>

956
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.990
<v Speaker 3>but if you eat a piece of salmon or if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you had a bowl of pasta,</v>

957
00:42:13.991 --> 00:42:16.780
<v Speaker 3>it's a very different reaction how your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body absorbs these two things.</v>

958
00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

959
00:42:18.191 --> 00:42:19.024
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is true because all calories </v>

960
00:42:19.781 --> 00:42:20.614
<v Speaker 2>aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't the same as they both get </v>

961
00:42:21.821 --> 00:42:22.654
<v Speaker 2>absorbed to sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but avoiding gluten and switching over </v>

962
00:42:25.301 --> 00:42:26.700
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

963
00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:27.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all rice,</v>

964
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.963
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>

965
00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:29.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to change a for that </v>

966
00:42:32.021 --> 00:42:32.854
<v Speaker 2>all that much in your body in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's in terms of the biochemical </v>

967
00:42:35.741 --> 00:42:38.500
<v Speaker 2>mischief and unless you have a gluten </v>
<v Speaker 2>allergy,</v>

968
00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:41.520
<v Speaker 2>like that's none of that yet</v>

969
00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.190
<v Speaker 3>the sensitivities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also a level.</v>

970
00:42:44.191 --> 00:42:45.001
<v Speaker 3>So that too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

971
00:42:45.001 --> 00:42:46.900
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some people where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>mildly,</v>

972
00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.330
<v Speaker 3>minorly irritating and there's some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that have extreme issues with it.</v>

973
00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's at this point,</v>

974
00:42:52.141 --> 00:42:54.570
<v Speaker 2>and this is why I always say at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point in our scientific knowledge,</v>

975
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.090
<v Speaker 2>scientific knowledge can evolve and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can learn new things.</v>

976
00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:57.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

977
00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.630
<v Speaker 2>at one point the thing that started off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole gluten trend,</v>

978
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a kind of poorly,</v>

979
00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.533
<v Speaker 2>a poorly designed study where they had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>small sample size of people and they </v>

980
00:43:07.231 --> 00:43:08.800
<v Speaker 2>designed it just to test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

981
00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.550
<v Speaker 2>gluten versus a non,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a diet without gluten.</v>

982
00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:15.390
<v Speaker 2>And they came to the conclusion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 20 percent of people just based on</v>

983
00:43:15.391 --> 00:43:20.280
<v Speaker 2>this very small study had a bad reaction</v>
<v Speaker 2>to gluten and well,</v>

984
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:24.210
<v Speaker 2>these people came in saying they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach problems.</v>

985
00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:25.283
<v Speaker 2>Now these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned out they looked at it and </v>

986
00:43:26.851 --> 00:43:27.684
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no.</v>

987
00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:29.730
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Afterwards assigned to saul sat back and</v>

988
00:43:29.731 --> 00:43:30.564
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why we're only about one percent of </v>

989
00:43:32.101 --> 00:43:33.930
<v Speaker 2>people having celiac disease.</v>

990
00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:34.763
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden 20 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are running around like glutens </v>

991
00:43:37.051 --> 00:43:39.360
<v Speaker 2>making their Dick flies off a fly off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

992
00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.313
<v Speaker 2>there's something up here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they made a better design study and </v>

993
00:43:42.961 --> 00:43:44.490
<v Speaker 2>they took out common core.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did,</v>

994
00:43:44.491 --> 00:43:46.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda double blind did a,</v>

995
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:47.103
<v Speaker 2>a better design.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of just say we're going to take </v>

996
00:43:48.151 --> 00:43:48.984
<v Speaker 2>out all these other causes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>gastrointestinal distress and we're </v>

997
00:43:51.991 --> 00:43:55.140
<v Speaker 2>going to try and make this double blind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they figured out it was the fodmap,</v>

998
00:43:55.141 --> 00:43:55.974
<v Speaker 2>so it was there were these short chain </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal saccharide second pull water </v>

999
00:43:58.861 --> 00:43:59.694
<v Speaker 2>into the gut and cause some </v>
<v Speaker 2>gastrointestinal distress and it was </v>

1000
00:44:01.891 --> 00:44:02.724
<v Speaker 2>really closer to between like one and </v>
<v Speaker 2>about five percent of people that were </v>

1001
00:44:05.761 --> 00:44:09.930
<v Speaker 2>having any issues with gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem is that what was causing</v>

1002
00:44:09.931 --> 00:44:12.630
<v Speaker 2>that though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gastrointestinal distress in the.</v>

1003
00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:13.803
<v Speaker 2>In the one to five percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one percent is celiac disease for </v>

1004
00:44:16.561 --> 00:44:16.860
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1005
00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:17.760
<v Speaker 2>One percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:19.463
<v Speaker 2>His across the board with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One percent is celiac that is fairly </v>

1007
00:44:22.681 --> 00:44:23.514
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the thing that that higher </v>

1008
00:44:24.601 --> 00:44:25.434
<v Speaker 2>percent of people that two to five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the question now they're still </v>

1009
00:44:28.231 --> 00:44:31.890
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out why some people </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to have an with gluten.</v>

1010
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:33.121
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong on.</v>

1011
00:44:33.121 --> 00:44:35.610
<v Speaker 2>This is just off the top of my head what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember from the study,</v>

1012
00:44:35.611 --> 00:44:38.580
<v Speaker 2>but I've had to it a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think my knowledge is accurate.</v>

1013
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Feel free to fact check me out at home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1014
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.840
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1015
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.213
<v Speaker 2>the thing with those extra percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to figure out why they </v>

1016
00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:48.810
<v Speaker 2>might have an issue with gluten because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1017
00:44:48.811 --> 00:44:50.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like wheat is,</v>

1018
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:52.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think of it as a carb heavy thing,</v>

1019
00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:53.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And gluten is a protein,</v>

1020
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:55.373
<v Speaker 2>so that other few percentage of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to figure out why the </v>

1021
00:44:57.961 --> 00:45:00.630
<v Speaker 2>gluten a does it because gluten is in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few other things.</v>

1022
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:03.060
<v Speaker 2>It's in barley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raw and rye.</v>

1023
00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what they figured out is that this is</v>

1024
00:45:06.421 --> 00:45:11.100
<v Speaker 2>the going theory right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gluten can cause a small,</v>

1025
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:11.963
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reaction in the stomach where you </v>

1026
00:45:13.621 --> 00:45:17.010
<v Speaker 2>produce this protein called Zonulin that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can cause an increase in inflammation.</v>

1027
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:18.990
<v Speaker 2>This seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I,</v>

1028
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.090
<v Speaker 2>this has only been one study that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>read on it.</v>

1029
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:23.820
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be relatively new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still looking into it.</v>

1030
00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:24.654
<v Speaker 2>So there's a chance that people might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the two to five percent that can </v>

1031
00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:28.980
<v Speaker 2>handle it because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1032
00:45:28.981 --> 00:45:32.220
<v Speaker 2>it could be another component of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheat barley,</v>

1033
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:35.610
<v Speaker 2>rye that's causing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but gluten in and of itself,</v>

1034
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:36.550
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1035
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:41.630
<v Speaker 2>it's unless you are one of those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has an actual reaction to it,</v>

1036
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:43.380
<v Speaker 2>perfectly fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go on to have,</v>

1037
00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:44.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go have a sandwich.</v>

1038
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:45.870
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1039
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.340
<v Speaker 2>if you want one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1040
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:49.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cut back my carbs pretty heavily over </v>

1041
00:45:51.061 --> 00:45:53.970
<v Speaker 2>the last couple years and I've had </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good results whether it's,</v>

1042
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're someone who's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>build muscle,</v>

1043
00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:56.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that just eventually it </v>

1044
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:00.600
<v Speaker 2>becomes too much sugar.</v>

1045
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.160
<v Speaker 2>So much sugar in your body if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating a lot number.</v>

1046
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.013
<v Speaker 2>Back when you said that food pyramid and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the food pyramid was all </v>

1047
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:07.043
<v Speaker 2>breads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's kind of interesting </v>

1048
00:46:09.091 --> 00:46:11.850
<v Speaker 2>because that's like stealing like Dr </v>
<v Speaker 2>Seuss books that are read to my kids.</v>

1049
00:46:11.851 --> 00:46:12.421
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1050
00:46:12.421 --> 00:46:13.254
<v Speaker 2>they haven't figured this out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was supposed to eat that much bread </v>

1051
00:46:15.901 --> 00:46:18.060
<v Speaker 2>and pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not supposed to be the most thing.</v>

1052
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:19.110
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny.</v>

1053
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:20.920
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the funny parts of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1054
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.400
<v Speaker 2>is that back in the day when that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>

1055
00:46:23.401 --> 00:46:25.710
<v Speaker 2>I think slices of bread were much </v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller.</v>

1056
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:27.570
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1057
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:28.543
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part of it because I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>think people didn't know as much back </v>

1058
00:46:30.391 --> 00:46:31.520
<v Speaker 2>then as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part.</v>

1059
00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:33.240
<v Speaker 2>I think there are a few things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on with that.</v>

1060
00:46:33.241 --> 00:46:35.570
<v Speaker 2>One is that we're really bad at counting</v>
<v Speaker 2>calories and we,</v>

1061
00:46:35.571 --> 00:46:36.404
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were chatting a little bit before he </v>

1062
00:46:36.931 --> 00:46:37.764
<v Speaker 2>showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1063
00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.100
<v Speaker 2>is that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they now have a way of tracking how many</v>

1064
00:46:41.101 --> 00:46:44.970
<v Speaker 2>calories people had taken a day through </v>
<v Speaker 2>this drink that can,</v>

1065
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:46.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget exactly how it works,</v>

1066
00:46:46.291 --> 00:46:47.124
<v Speaker 2>but you can take a drink and it will </v>
<v Speaker 2>count the number of calories you've had </v>

1067
00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:50.910
<v Speaker 2>in about the last 24 hours.</v>

1068
00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:54.450
<v Speaker 2>And they've found there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget,</v>

1069
00:46:54.451 --> 00:46:55.860
<v Speaker 2>I forget exactly how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1070
00:46:55.861 --> 00:46:58.380
<v Speaker 2>I'll find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll shoot you the article after this,</v>

1071
00:46:58.381 --> 00:47:00.000
<v Speaker 2>but this was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1072
00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:01.260
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1073
00:47:01.261 --> 00:47:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I need to find this article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>

1074
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:04.050
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could do this.</v>

1075
00:47:04.051 --> 00:47:07.200
<v Speaker 2>And they were tracking how registered </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dietitians versus,</v>

1076
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:08.063
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1077
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.350
<v Speaker 2>average Joe would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1078
00:47:10.351 --> 00:47:11.690
<v Speaker 2>could Qa because they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1079
00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.740
<v Speaker 2>you count down how many calories you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>an a day,</v>

1080
00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:15.750
<v Speaker 2>a registered dietician who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1081
00:47:15.751 --> 00:47:16.584
<v Speaker 2>really well trained on dietetic type </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff versus average person counting </v>

1082
00:47:20.311 --> 00:47:21.144
<v Speaker 2>their calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dietitian was off by about 200 </v>

1083
00:47:22.711 --> 00:47:23.544
<v Speaker 2>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A average person was off by about 500 </v>

1084
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:28.320
<v Speaker 2>interact with our guests about what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>

1085
00:47:28.321 --> 00:47:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were talking to bad 100,</v>

1086
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:31.264
<v Speaker 2>over several thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what most people think about </v>

1087
00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:35.284
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're trying to lose weight and </v>

1088
00:47:35.711 --> 00:47:39.120
<v Speaker 2>you're the average person and you're off</v>
<v Speaker 2>by 500 calories and that's how.</v>

1089
00:47:39.121 --> 00:47:40.280
<v Speaker 2>And you're supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1090
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.280
<v Speaker 2>in the course of a week to lose one </v>
<v Speaker 2>pound,</v>

1091
00:47:42.281 --> 00:47:45.370
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to have a 500 calorie </v>
<v Speaker 2>caloric deficit.</v>

1092
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:47.830
<v Speaker 2>There's your deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not there anymore.</v>

1093
00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:51.760
<v Speaker 2>So people are really bad at tracking </v>
<v Speaker 2>their calories and they're really bad at</v>

1094
00:47:51.761 --> 00:47:52.594
<v Speaker 2>knowing what a portion size is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the best ways I've seen from </v>

1095
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:56.403
<v Speaker 2>the personal trainers that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I confer with is weighing out your </v>

1096
00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:01.060
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much harder to make a mistake.</v>

1097
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:02.083
<v Speaker 3>That is a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another way is there's a bunch of </v>

1098
00:48:03.601 --> 00:48:05.700
<v Speaker 3>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any affiliation with any of</v>

1099
00:48:05.701 --> 00:48:06.534
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a bunch of companies that </v>

1100
00:48:06.931 --> 00:48:11.490
<v Speaker 3>make prepackaged meals that are healthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they.</v>

1101
00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:12.413
<v Speaker 3>They'll tell you exactly what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>portion sizes are and exactly how many </v>

1102
00:48:15.151 --> 00:48:15.984
<v Speaker 3>calories are in and what the nutrients </v>
<v Speaker 3>are in and are in that package and </v>

1103
00:48:19.381 --> 00:48:21.360
<v Speaker 3>that's a good way to do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no guesswork.</v>

1104
00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:22.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1105
00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.173
<v Speaker 2>here's one of the other things like I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think carbs as you know in and of </v>

1106
00:48:25.821 --> 00:48:26.654
<v Speaker 2>themselves are evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to burn what you take </v>

1107
00:48:28.341 --> 00:48:29.810
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to balance your carbs,</v>

1108
00:48:29.811 --> 00:48:30.920
<v Speaker 2>your fats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your proteins,</v>

1109
00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:34.700
<v Speaker 2>and you'll be okay and it really depends</v>
<v Speaker 2>on what you're doing for exercise.</v>

1110
00:48:34.701 --> 00:48:38.270
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people overestimate how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much they move under our under.</v>

1111
00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overestimate how much they move,</v>

1112
00:48:39.651 --> 00:48:40.484
<v Speaker 2>underestimate how much they eat and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm friends with a lot of people in the </v>

1113
00:48:43.191 --> 00:48:44.024
<v Speaker 2>fitness community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of weight lifters and depends on </v>

1114
00:48:46.671 --> 00:48:48.190
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're on a bulk,</v>

1115
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:50.090
<v Speaker 2>there'll their calories will go up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>3000.</v>

1116
00:48:50.091 --> 00:48:50.990
<v Speaker 2>If they're on a cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1117
00:48:50.991 --> 00:48:53.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm on like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on poverty carbs right now.</v>

1118
00:48:53.661 --> 00:48:56.070
<v Speaker 2>So it's like 50 carbs over the course </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're talking about.</v>

1119
00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Bodybuilding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1120
00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:57.973
<v Speaker 2>It's so unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that we think of that as a </v>

1121
00:49:01.101 --> 00:49:03.670
<v Speaker 2>healthy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because like during the,</v>

1122
00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.230
<v Speaker 2>like the year when they're not training </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a competition,</v>

1123
00:49:06.231 --> 00:49:09.500
<v Speaker 2>it looks fine and then when they're like</v>
<v Speaker 2>six weeks out from a competition,</v>

1124
00:49:09.501 --> 00:49:11.870
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a cup of water a day.</v>

1125
00:49:11.871 --> 00:49:12.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1126
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:14.100
<v Speaker 3>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not good for you.</v>

1127
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:15.263
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not good for them during the time </v>

1128
00:49:16.501 --> 00:49:18.640
<v Speaker 3>where they're cutting and treading and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm talking about.</v>

1129
00:49:18.641 --> 00:49:19.474
<v Speaker 3>Like when you see a bodybuilder onstage </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're shredded and they have zero </v>

1130
00:49:23.041 --> 00:49:23.874
<v Speaker 3>body made it down to like probably like </v>
<v Speaker 3>three or four percent or some time for </v>

1131
00:49:26.931 --> 00:49:28.410
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So unhealthy.</v>

1132
00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:30.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're literally on death's door,</v>

1133
00:49:30.601 --> 00:49:32.580
<v Speaker 3>but they look amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the shredded.</v>

1134
00:49:32.581 --> 00:49:36.750
<v Speaker 3>You can see every last in you and fiber </v>
<v Speaker 3>of their muscle,</v>

1135
00:49:36.751 --> 00:49:40.620
<v Speaker 3>but that's a someone who's like in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really bad place.</v>

1136
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Kidneys are like that close to passing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to to go and away.</v>

1137
00:49:44.591 --> 00:49:45.424
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

1138
00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:49.670
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely not good for your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're in that performance zone.</v>

1139
00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.280
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird that that's what we really</v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy.</v>

1140
00:49:52.281 --> 00:49:53.114
<v Speaker 3>Looking at those.</v>

1141
00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.710
<v Speaker 2>The rest of the year though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eat.</v>

1142
00:49:54.711 --> 00:49:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my trainer is a,</v>

1143
00:49:57.091 --> 00:49:57.924
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a bodybuilder and it's like what he </v>

1144
00:49:58.731 --> 00:50:01.160
<v Speaker 2>has me on for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for weight loss.</v>

1145
00:50:01.161 --> 00:50:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about 1600 calories a day.</v>

1146
00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fairly okay balance of proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbs and fats.</v>

1147
00:50:08.631 --> 00:50:09.464
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at first he had me on a much higher </v>

1148
00:50:10.821 --> 00:50:12.810
<v Speaker 2>amount of carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not losing builder.</v>

1149
00:50:12.811 --> 00:50:14.730
<v Speaker 2>And you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he a dietician?</v>

1150
00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:15.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've,</v>

1151
00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:16.663
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1152
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.511
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1153
00:50:17.511 --> 00:50:20.480
<v Speaker 2>but I have consulted with a Dietitian </v>
<v Speaker 2>too because I have these,</v>

1154
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:21.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the people I consult with for </v>

1155
00:50:21.951 --> 00:50:23.540
<v Speaker 2>my writing and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1156
00:50:23.541 --> 00:50:24.740
<v Speaker 2>that looks all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not,</v>

1157
00:50:24.741 --> 00:50:27.650
<v Speaker 2>you're not anything crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's because of my height and weight</v>

1158
00:50:27.651 --> 00:50:29.520
<v Speaker 2>that I started with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At first he had me at 1800.</v>

1159
00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:31.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not quite losing here.</v>

1160
00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:32.493
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go down another couple hundred </v>

1161
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.530
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the way they started out with is</v>

1162
00:50:36.531 --> 00:50:37.191
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1163
00:50:37.191 --> 00:50:40.340
<v Speaker 2>your wait times 10 and then they bust up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the carbs,</v>

1164
00:50:40.341 --> 00:50:41.570
<v Speaker 2>proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fats from there.</v>

1165
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.591
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1166
00:50:42.591 --> 00:50:44.690
<v Speaker 2>if you need to adjust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go from,</v>

1167
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:45.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go from there.</v>

1168
00:50:45.531 --> 00:50:47.470
<v Speaker 2>And it's like it started with lifting </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

1169
00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.353
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've screwed up my joints so </v>

1170
00:50:49.701 --> 00:50:51.410
<v Speaker 2>badly for the amount of running I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done that,</v>

1171
00:50:51.411 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1172
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I will try weight lifting and it's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of fun.</v>

1173
00:50:54.921 --> 00:50:57.500
<v Speaker 2>I've enjoyed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've enjoyed learning how to do</v>

1174
00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:59.103
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You screw your joints up from running </v>

1175
00:51:00.181 --> 00:51:01.470
<v Speaker 3>but not from lifting weights.</v>

1176
00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Tim has been a little easier on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>joints,</v>

1177
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.260
<v Speaker 2>joints maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have,</v>

1178
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1179
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.500
<v Speaker 2>I have a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit of a joint condition.</v>

1180
00:51:09.501 --> 00:51:11.360
<v Speaker 2>So their condition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's they,</v>

1181
00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:14.780
<v Speaker 2>they pop out of the socket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And was that from um,</v>

1182
00:51:14.781 --> 00:51:15.740
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called.</v>

1183
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:19.370
<v Speaker 2>You're hearing all of my medical stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I apologize.</v>

1184
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:21.300
<v Speaker 2>It's called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

1185
00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:24.140
<v Speaker 2>do you want to see it or no?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do it.</v>

1186
00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can pop my shoulder halfway out.</v>

1187
00:51:25.721 --> 00:51:26.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1188
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.190
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now most people when they stretch,</v>

1189
00:51:28.191 --> 00:51:28.881
<v Speaker 2>they stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1190
00:51:28.881 --> 00:51:31.460
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let keep going.</v>

1191
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:34.423
<v Speaker 2>But I've had like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one's had threesomes like your </v>

1193
00:51:36.231 --> 00:51:37.370
<v Speaker 2>shoulders flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1194
00:51:37.371 --> 00:51:38.204
<v Speaker 2>But I mean there's a bunch of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>locations if you can see it's popping a </v>

1195
00:51:40.791 --> 00:51:42.230
<v Speaker 2>little bit right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1196
00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:44.240
<v Speaker 2>it's like my hip hop's partway out </v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on that.</v>

1197
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.373
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't really strengthened to keep it </v>

1198
00:51:48.081 --> 00:51:50.030
<v Speaker 2>from happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more weightlifting I do,</v>

1199
00:51:50.031 --> 00:51:52.190
<v Speaker 2>the less popping it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's been,</v>

1200
00:51:52.191 --> 00:51:54.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is way less bad than it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a few months ago before,</v>

1201
00:51:54.801 --> 00:51:57.800
<v Speaker 2>like you could visibly see the pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can still feel it,</v>

1202
00:51:57.801 --> 00:51:58.634
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the problem with being hyper </v>

1203
00:52:01.301 --> 00:52:02.930
<v Speaker 2>mobile like that is your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1204
00:52:02.931 --> 00:52:06.380
<v Speaker 2>you leave yourself open to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different injuries from a,</v>

1205
00:52:06.381 --> 00:52:07.214
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from like basic movement can make </v>

1206
00:52:08.571 --> 00:52:09.890
<v Speaker 2>something snap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1207
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:11.590
<v Speaker 2>this goes back</v>

1208
00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:12.423
<v Speaker 3>to what we're talking about when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to people that have back issues </v>

1209
00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:20.490
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things that has been like</v>
<v Speaker 3>super beneficial for me is exercising my</v>

1210
00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:21.904
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yoga and doing a bunch of different </v>

1211
00:52:25.451 --> 00:52:26.284
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stretching and making sure that my core </v>

1212
00:52:29.171 --> 00:52:34.171
<v Speaker 3>and my spine are very strong and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that kind of gets ignored by a</v>

1213
00:52:34.601 --> 00:52:35.434
<v Speaker 3>lot of people that have back issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of the reasons why you </v>

1214
00:52:37.691 --> 00:52:38.524
<v Speaker 3>probably have a back issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a herniated disc or a </v>

1215
00:52:40.511 --> 00:52:41.344
<v Speaker 3>bulging disk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that your back is not strong enough </v>

1216
00:52:44.291 --> 00:52:47.050
<v Speaker 3>to sustain whatever load you're putting </v>
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>

1217
00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:47.913
<v Speaker 3>Whatever exercise you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever movement you're doing that's </v>

1218
00:52:50.411 --> 00:52:51.244
<v Speaker 3>causing it to pop out of place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the issue is most likely that you are </v>

1219
00:52:54.851 --> 00:52:57.640
<v Speaker 3>not strong enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that comes from a sedentary</v>

1220
00:52:57.641 --> 00:52:58.474
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from sitting at a desk all the </v>

1221
00:52:59.471 --> 00:53:01.330
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from poor posture.</v>

1222
00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:02.253
<v Speaker 3>There's a variety of different factors </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are not addressed by chiropractors </v>

1223
00:53:06.311 --> 00:53:07.144
<v Speaker 3>or by other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they are addressed by a </v>

1224
00:53:07.661 --> 00:53:08.494
<v Speaker 3>chiropractor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's one good thing that they're </v>

1225
00:53:09.611 --> 00:53:10.960
<v Speaker 3>telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1226
00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:13.720
<v Speaker 3>it still doesn't take away from where </v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole thing started.</v>

1227
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it's not,</v>

1228
00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.170
<v Speaker 2>it's not always the case of back </v>
<v Speaker 2>injuries come from that,</v>

1229
00:53:17.171 --> 00:53:19.460
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes it's just you did like </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1230
00:53:19.461 --> 00:53:22.410
<v Speaker 2>your disc was gonna degenerate that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>written into,</v>

1231
00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.860
<v Speaker 2>that was written into your life like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1232
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my boyfriend</v>

1233
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.810
<v Speaker 4>did nothing to screw up his back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just a distorted degenerating and he was</v>

1234
00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:31.644
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a rock climber and there was no </v>

1235
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:35.160
<v Speaker 4>known injury.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just it happened.</v>

1236
00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.253
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1237
00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:38.640
<v Speaker 4>like I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you know that though,</v>

1238
00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:41.060
<v Speaker 4>when you're talking about someone having</v>
<v Speaker 4>an issue with their disc,</v>

1239
00:53:41.061 --> 00:53:44.850
<v Speaker 4>is it from continual use?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it because they're not stretching?</v>

1240
00:53:44.851 --> 00:53:47.140
<v Speaker 4>Is it because they didn't have enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>strength in the back?</v>

1241
00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are all really valid questions and</v>

1242
00:53:49.231 --> 00:53:51.510
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never know what,</v>

1243
00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:54.570
<v Speaker 4>you never know what's going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause of it beforehand.</v>

1244
00:53:54.571 --> 00:53:56.340
<v Speaker 4>And that's why preventative medicine is </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard.</v>

1245
00:53:56.341 --> 00:53:58.800
<v Speaker 4>But that's why I always say get to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>gym and lift some weights.</v>

1246
00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:02.670
<v Speaker 4>It will at least if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're someone who is prone to having</v>

1247
00:54:02.671 --> 00:54:03.504
<v Speaker 4>a backend issue issue because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are some people who are prone to </v>

1248
00:54:07.021 --> 00:54:08.910
<v Speaker 4>it get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>

1249
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:11.460
<v Speaker 4>Why would they be prone to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1250
00:54:11.461 --> 00:54:13.950
<v Speaker 4>in my case I have scoliosis as a part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1251
00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:15.600
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a part of Stan loads.</v>

1252
00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:18.390
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why I say prone to it because you</v>

1253
00:54:18.391 --> 00:54:19.224
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times prone to disc </v>

1254
00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.113
<v Speaker 4>degeneration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's someone would be prone to the </v>

1255
00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:26.280
<v Speaker 4>degenerative disc disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1256
00:54:26.281 --> 00:54:27.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1257
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:28.170
<v Speaker 4>actually I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1258
00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:31.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if that's disputed thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1259
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.863
<v Speaker 4>I'm much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really don't know off the top of my </v>

1260
00:54:32.581 --> 00:54:34.130
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know if that's a,</v>

1261
00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:35.940
<v Speaker 4>if that's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1262
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.193
<v Speaker 4>that you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's written into your dna or if </v>

1263
00:54:39.781 --> 00:54:42.100
<v Speaker 4>that's something that you injure and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>just gets worse.</v>

1264
00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:43.680
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1265
00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.593
<v Speaker 4>That's what I've been talking to people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that work on people that have bulging </v>

1266
00:54:47.341 --> 00:54:48.174
<v Speaker 4>discs and doctors that are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's some new therapies that </v>

1267
00:54:50.671 --> 00:54:51.420
<v Speaker 4>are doing for that now.</v>

1268
00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:52.253
<v Speaker 4>One of the things they're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're injecting stem cells directly </v>

1269
00:54:54.331 --> 00:54:55.390
<v Speaker 4>into the risks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1270
00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:57.570
<v Speaker 4>It's very new and they're doing it on </v>
<v Speaker 4>some fighters.</v>

1271
00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.090
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd love to see how that pans out.</v>

1272
00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.173
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got some really promising </v>

1273
00:55:01.651 --> 00:55:02.484
<v Speaker 4>results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently they've just started it </v>

1274
00:55:04.021 --> 00:55:06.000
<v Speaker 4>within the last six to eight months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1275
00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:06.843
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the biggest issue I have is that I have </v>

1276
00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.193
<v Speaker 4>A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not a bad enough case of </v>

1277
00:55:10.261 --> 00:55:13.860
<v Speaker 4>scoliosis where I need surgery or a back</v>
<v Speaker 4>brace.</v>

1278
00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:17.580
<v Speaker 4>It's just enough to be inconvenient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like I'm.</v>

1279
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:20.910
<v Speaker 4>My big thing I'm doing is all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I can lift and keep my back strong,</v>

1280
00:55:20.911 --> 00:55:23.010
<v Speaker 4>it will stop me from having surgery </v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually.</v>

1281
00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:23.844
<v Speaker 4>And back surgery is just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost never a good thing to hear </v>

1282
00:55:26.341 --> 00:55:29.910
<v Speaker 4>because they're always there when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>fix something surgically.</v>

1283
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.010
<v Speaker 4>They're just almost always </v>
<v Speaker 4>complications,</v>

1284
00:55:32.011 --> 00:55:33.190
<v Speaker 4>especially with your back on.</v>

1285
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:35.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I can keep rods out of my pack,</v>

1286
00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:36.140
<v Speaker 4>I'll be very happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1287
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.983
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had some surgeries that were very </v>

1288
00:55:37.741 --> 00:55:38.574
<v Speaker 4>effective of knee reconstructions to </v>
<v Speaker 4>both my knees been reconstructed with </v>

1289
00:55:41.901 --> 00:55:43.050
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It turned out great,</v>

1290
00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:46.320
<v Speaker 4>but I have had friends that have had </v>
<v Speaker 4>some back issues,</v>

1291
00:55:46.321 --> 00:55:47.760
<v Speaker 4>especially fusions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1292
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.830
<v Speaker 4>that had been a big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big nightmare.</v>

1293
00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:50.703
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1294
00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:51.623
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'd probably end up with </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] like middle of my back and </v>

1295
00:55:53.581 --> 00:55:56.710
<v Speaker 4>just kind of goes like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not something I like.</v>

1296
00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:58.450
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

1297
00:55:58.590 --> 00:55:59.423
<v Speaker 4>I've been told it's something I love </v>
<v Speaker 4>Yoga and I've been told it's not good </v>

1298
00:56:02.521 --> 00:56:04.050
<v Speaker 4>for people with ehlers Danlos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm like,</v>

1299
00:56:04.051 --> 00:56:07.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't have been told that by my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my rheumatologist.</v>

1300
00:56:07.261 --> 00:56:08.390
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like,</v>

1301
00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:10.290
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are still some yoga moves.</v>

1302
00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:11.124
<v Speaker 4>I do just be at the end of my workout </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they feel they feel great to </v>

1303
00:56:14.851 --> 00:56:17.940
<v Speaker 4>stretch out my back and they feel like </v>
<v Speaker 4>they strengthen my core quite a bit.</v>

1304
00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:22.570
<v Speaker 4>So they say it's bad for you because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>how like because of how hyper mobile am,</v>

1305
00:56:22.571 --> 00:56:23.404
<v Speaker 4>like it's I'll do downward dog and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't even feel like it stretches me </v>

1306
00:56:27.431 --> 00:56:32.431
<v Speaker 4>because I'm a hyper because I'm so Flexi</v>
<v Speaker 4>to start with and that makes sense.</v>

1307
00:56:32.471 --> 00:56:35.470
<v Speaker 4>But you still strengthening those </v>
<v Speaker 4>muscles to support your spine.</v>

1308
00:56:35.471 --> 00:56:36.304
<v Speaker 4>What would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bad.</v>

1309
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:39.580
<v Speaker 4>I got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can deadlift and you can't do yoga.</v>

1310
00:56:39.581 --> 00:56:42.190
<v Speaker 4>That seems ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make any sense at all.</v>

1311
00:56:42.191 --> 00:56:45.520
<v Speaker 4>Welcome to a really weird disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what it is.</v>

1312
00:56:45.521 --> 00:56:46.354
<v Speaker 4>Or is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doctors don't really exactly know what </v>

1313
00:56:47.621 --> 00:56:50.800
<v Speaker 4>the fuck they're talking about because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of doctors you get injured</v>

1314
00:56:50.801 --> 00:56:51.221
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1315
00:56:51.221 --> 00:56:54.070
<v Speaker 4>you got to stop doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an inside thing where it's like Los</v>

1316
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:57.440
<v Speaker 4>Angeles is a Weirdo disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like your basically your Collagen is not</v>

1317
00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:00.400
<v Speaker 4>able to heal itself or stay kind of in </v>
<v Speaker 4>shape,</v>

1318
00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:01.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as it used to.</v>

1319
00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.930
<v Speaker 4>Or as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a deadlift deadlift has been fine.</v>

1320
00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:05.620
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1321
00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.180
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's partially,</v>

1322
00:57:07.181 --> 00:57:08.014
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1323
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:11.550
<v Speaker 4>it's personally that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>stretching,</v>

1324
00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:13.870
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're strengthening or your.</v>

1325
00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how else to phrase it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not,</v>

1326
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:18.490
<v Speaker 4>you're not stretching your body into </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird positions.</v>

1327
00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:19.260
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1328
00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:20.093
<v Speaker 4>you're tensing everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of yoga that's not </v>

1329
00:57:21.791 --> 00:57:23.980
<v Speaker 4>stretching and strengthening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you're,</v>

1330
00:57:23.981 --> 00:57:25.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're standing.</v>

1331
00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:27.730
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a bunch of stretches,</v>

1332
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:31.750
<v Speaker 4>but it's obviously there's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that do stretch your body out,</v>

1333
00:57:31.751 --> 00:57:34.240
<v Speaker 4>but there's a bunch of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>just strengthening exercises.</v>

1334
00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:37.120
<v Speaker 4>You have an f,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a really good point.</v>

1335
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:37.954
<v Speaker 4>And I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just what I've been told from a </v>

1336
00:57:39.821 --> 00:57:42.430
<v Speaker 4>doctor who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in all honesty,</v>

1337
00:57:42.431 --> 00:57:45.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how well he knows ehlers </v>
<v Speaker 4>Danlos because it's a rare disorder.</v>

1338
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:48.760
<v Speaker 4>Doctors like to say don't do that.</v>

1339
00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:52.270
<v Speaker 4>That's a big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially with the injured.</v>

1340
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.133
<v Speaker 4>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's weird because the things </v>

1341
00:57:54.161 --> 00:57:57.710
<v Speaker 4>they've told me to do seem so much more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1342
00:57:57.711 --> 00:57:59.980
<v Speaker 4>intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then Yoga,</v>

1343
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:01.440
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1344
00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.910
<v Speaker 4>I've been told go ahead and bite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go ahead and uh,</v>

1345
00:58:03.911 --> 00:58:05.810
<v Speaker 4>and a deadlift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go ahead and,</v>

1346
00:58:05.811 --> 00:58:08.410
<v Speaker 4>and for Fuck Sake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they told me I can rock climb,</v>

1347
00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.540
<v Speaker 4>which is a thing that's one of my other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1348
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:12.010
<v Speaker 4>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eat things.</v>

1349
00:58:12.011 --> 00:58:15.580
<v Speaker 4>But Yoga they've said is off limits and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's because of yoga.</v>

1350
00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when people say don't do yoga,</v>

1351
00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:19.474
<v Speaker 4>I always think they think of somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>like bending over and touching the back </v>

1352
00:58:21.911 --> 00:58:22.744
<v Speaker 4>of their head onto their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the reason is because they know </v>

1353
00:58:24.731 --> 00:58:25.564
<v Speaker 4>how flexible I started at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they think I'm going to pull </v>

1354
00:58:28.061 --> 00:58:28.894
<v Speaker 4>something out more because of how like </v>
<v Speaker 4>how much I'll push the condition that's </v>

1355
00:58:33.041 --> 00:58:35.680
<v Speaker 4>already there and I think that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>concern.</v>

1356
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:37.750
<v Speaker 4>So the problem with someone saying don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>do yoga.</v>

1357
00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:38.793
<v Speaker 4>Well Yoga encompasses a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of different movements and it's </v>

1358
00:58:41.501 --> 00:58:42.071
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1359
00:58:42.071 --> 00:58:43.500
<v Speaker 4>I find it really strengthening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1360
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:45.160
<v Speaker 4>and I was surprised because like I used </v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1361
00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:47.260
<v Speaker 4>I used to be kind of that runner chick </v>
<v Speaker 4>who was like,</v>

1362
00:58:47.261 --> 00:58:49.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't have time for yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's boring.</v>

1363
00:58:49.241 --> 00:58:51.520
<v Speaker 4>And then I started trying it of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1364
00:58:51.521 --> 00:58:52.354
<v Speaker 4>My boyfriend tried,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dragged me to a yoga class with him and </v>

1365
00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:56.350
<v Speaker 4>I left and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am destroyed.</v>

1366
00:58:56.351 --> 00:58:58.260
<v Speaker 4>That was the hardest thing I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking done.</v>

1367
00:58:59.040 --> 00:58:59.741
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1368
00:58:59.741 --> 00:59:02.890
<v Speaker 4>my arms were dead afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard now.</v>

1369
00:59:02.891 --> 00:59:06.220
<v Speaker 4>What made you decide to write this </v>
<v Speaker 4>chiropractic article and what's been the</v>

1370
00:59:06.221 --> 00:59:07.990
<v Speaker 4>feedback from it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

1371
00:59:07.991 --> 00:59:10.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm so my,</v>

1376

<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1377
00:59:19.601 --> 00:59:22.970
<v Speaker 4>Kairos for ages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to the outline and it was like,</v>

1378
00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:24.013
<v Speaker 4>what are we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do we have on the table for next </v>

1379
00:59:24.771 --> 00:59:25.221
<v Speaker 4>one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>

1380

1383
00:59:29.781 --> 00:59:31.880

<v Speaker 4>Before I wrote the article,</v>

1384
00:59:31.881 --> 00:59:36.290
<v Speaker 4>I knew that the guy who had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew that a lot of Kairos did a lot of</v>

1385
00:59:36.291 --> 00:59:37.124
<v Speaker 4>crazy things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew they adjusted infants that they </v>

1386
00:59:39.021 --> 00:59:42.500
<v Speaker 4>had claimed I knew about the vertebral </v>
<v Speaker 4>subluxation theory and that,</v>

1387
00:59:42.501 --> 00:59:44.060
<v Speaker 4>that was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1388
00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:45.770
<v Speaker 4>and I knew that a lot of them on social </v>
<v Speaker 4>media,</v>

1389
00:59:45.771 --> 00:59:48.440
<v Speaker 4>we're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the people I reported on was</v>

1390
00:59:48.441 --> 00:59:50.090
<v Speaker 4>billy Demoss,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>he's a whole cluster of fucks.</v>

1394
00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:57.320
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>

1395
00:59:57.321 --> 00:59:58.154
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so,</v>

1396
00:59:58.850 --> 00:59:59.661
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>if you're bored,</v>

1399
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:06.103
<v Speaker 4>if you're bored,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go for like go for 10 minutes and read </v>

1400
01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:08.780
<v Speaker 4>up on billy demoss.</v>

1401
01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.560
<v Speaker 4>He's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1402
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:11.680
<v Speaker 4>and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's.</v>

1403
01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:14.300
<v Speaker 4>And it's funny because I was not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get into that in a minute,</v>

1404
01:00:14.301 --> 01:00:15.440
<v Speaker 4>but like we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1405
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:19.970
<v Speaker 4>I learned a lot doing this because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't realize that a DD Palmer,</v>

1406
01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:21.890
<v Speaker 4>the guy who invented it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1407
01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:26.630
<v Speaker 4>he got most of his information from </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing seances with a dead doctor.</v>

1408
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.490
<v Speaker 4>That blew my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1409
01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:29.420
<v Speaker 4>I had to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1410
01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:31.760
<v Speaker 4>I know it's late and I'm a little high </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>

1411
01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:33.800
<v Speaker 4>but I had to have hallucinated that </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1412
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>read it again the next morning.</v>

1413
01:00:35.241 --> 01:00:36.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>

1414
01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.420
<v Speaker 4>that's for real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it was.</v>

1415
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:43.870
<v Speaker 4>And nobody in chiropractic questions </v>
<v Speaker 4>this when they go to Dr. we were telling</v>

1416
01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:46.220
<v Speaker 4>me this before the show and I stopped </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and said,</v>

1417
01:00:46.221 --> 01:00:47.054
<v Speaker 4>let's talk about this during the show </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you said you've talked to </v>

1418
01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:49.544
<v Speaker 4>chiropractors that we're in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 4>of chiropractic school and they read </v>

1419
01:00:53.481 --> 01:00:55.400
<v Speaker 4>about this stuff and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what in the fuck?</v>

1420
01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:56.413
<v Speaker 4>It's sort of like that Gypsy going clear</v>
<v Speaker 4>that scientology documentary that was a </v>

1421
01:00:59.271 --> 01:01:00.104
<v Speaker 4>good one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like scientology scientology with a </v>

1422
01:01:04.821 --> 01:01:06.590
<v Speaker 4>given the written notes by l Ron </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hubbard.</v>

1423
01:01:06.591 --> 01:01:07.424
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what in the fuck is this and your </v>

1424
01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.433
<v Speaker 4>$300,000 in and you can't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I got two emails from chiropractors </v>

1425
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:14.930
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I couldn't,</v>

1426
01:01:14.931 --> 01:01:16.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put their names out publicly.</v>

1427
01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:20.060
<v Speaker 4>But I got two emails from chiropractors </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I checked in and I'm like,</v>

1428
01:01:20.061 --> 01:01:22.550
<v Speaker 4>these are indeed chiropractors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to their websites.</v>

1429
01:01:22.551 --> 01:01:23.384
<v Speaker 4>They were absolutely on the level that </v>
<v Speaker 4>said they went to chiropractic school </v>

1430
01:01:27.231 --> 01:01:29.300
<v Speaker 4>and part way through they realized it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was all shit.</v>

1431
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:30.613
<v Speaker 4>One of them even said they wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>refer people to a chiropractor like it </v>

1432
01:01:33.561 --> 01:01:35.450
<v Speaker 4>was nutty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the guys,</v>

1433
01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.473
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he sent me to a forum for like in which </v>

1434
01:01:39.981 --> 01:01:42.740
<v Speaker 4>chiropractor's bitch about the field of </v>
<v Speaker 4>chiropractic.</v>

1435
01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.590
<v Speaker 4>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were like,</v>

1436
01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:46.453
<v Speaker 4>which part of this is bullshit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys believe in the vertebral </v>

1437
01:01:48.141 --> 01:01:49.370
<v Speaker 4>subluxation theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

1438
01:01:49.371 --> 01:01:51.230
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>subluxations don't exist.</v>

1439
01:01:51.231 --> 01:01:51.921
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1440
01:01:51.921 --> 01:01:53.670
<v Speaker 4>if you want to do this ethically just </v>
<v Speaker 4>cry,</v>

1441
01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take people in who have injuries,</v>

1442
01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:56.444
<v Speaker 4>try to do some physical therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get them stronger and get them out and </v>

1443
01:01:58.701 --> 01:01:59.534
<v Speaker 4>as few sessions as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're essentially unlicensed </v>

1444
01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:03.140
<v Speaker 4>physical therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

1445
01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.053
<v Speaker 4>it's funny because I'll occasionally </v>
<v Speaker 4>pass by a chiropractic clinic where I </v>

1446
01:02:06.201 --> 01:02:08.810
<v Speaker 4>see them saying back injuries work </v>
<v Speaker 4>injuries,</v>

1447
01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:09.831
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1448
01:02:09.831 --> 01:02:11.360
<v Speaker 4>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 4>physical therapy.</v>

1449
01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:12.111
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1450
01:02:12.111 --> 01:02:15.620
<v Speaker 4>if I ever wanted to go to a chiropractor</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I lost my mind and couldn't find</v>

1451
01:02:15.621 --> 01:02:17.990
<v Speaker 4>a physical therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the type I would go to.</v>

1452
01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:19.093
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you see them advertising magic </v>

1453
01:02:20.491 --> 01:02:22.650
<v Speaker 4>crystals and aura healing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking run,</v>

1454
01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:25.390
<v Speaker 4>run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is the,</v>

1455
01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.940
<v Speaker 4>there are a few of them out there.</v>

1456
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:30.420
<v Speaker 4>And I looked at one of the guys' </v>
<v Speaker 4>websites who emailed me and there was an</v>

1457
01:02:30.421 --> 01:02:31.260
<v Speaker 4>Faq.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1458
01:02:31.261 --> 01:02:33.210
<v Speaker 4>do you have to keep coming back forever?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1459
01:02:33.211 --> 01:02:35.490
<v Speaker 4>we try to get you out in as few sessions</v>
<v Speaker 4>as possible.</v>

1460
01:02:35.491 --> 01:02:36.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1461
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.040
<v Speaker 4>I have hope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>

1462
01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:39.730
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a woman who is,</v>

1463
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:41.023
<v Speaker 4>the of it is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like even if you're trying to get </v>

1464
01:02:44.251 --> 01:02:46.600
<v Speaker 4>me out as few sessions as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're still like.</v>

1465
01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.150
<v Speaker 4>But there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's funny,</v>

1466
01:02:48.151 --> 01:02:50.790
<v Speaker 4>there's a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her name is Britt Marie Hermes.</v>

1467
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:52.040
<v Speaker 4>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1468
01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:54.330
<v Speaker 4>she went to school to be a natural path </v>
<v Speaker 4>and she graduated,</v>

1469
01:02:54.331 --> 01:02:59.160
<v Speaker 4>became a naturopath and she realized </v>
<v Speaker 4>after a short period of time that it was</v>

1470
01:02:59.161 --> 01:03:01.410
<v Speaker 4>all bullshit like naturopathic doctor </v>
<v Speaker 4>and she's like,</v>

1471
01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:04.500
<v Speaker 4>we can't actually treat people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to send people to real doctors.</v>

1472
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:08.970
<v Speaker 4>The advice we're giving is all based on </v>
<v Speaker 4>misdirection and complete shit.</v>

1473
01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:09.803
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so in awe of the fact that she went </v>

1474
01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:16.230
<v Speaker 4>through this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She like,</v>

1475
01:03:16.231 --> 01:03:19.290
<v Speaker 4>and these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things they said was,</v>

1476
01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in all this debt.</v>

1477
01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:21.780
<v Speaker 4>I figured,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1478
01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:22.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul Haggis,</v>

1479
01:03:22.831 --> 01:03:24.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm already here.</v>

1480
01:03:24.031 --> 01:03:26.340
<v Speaker 4>May as well keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Britt said,</v>

1481
01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:27.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>

1482
01:03:27.331 --> 01:03:29.700
<v Speaker 4>I realized I was in a profession based </v>
<v Speaker 4>on bullshit.</v>

1483
01:03:29.701 --> 01:03:30.534
<v Speaker 4>I had to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did have some people that you talked </v>

1484
01:03:32.761 --> 01:03:33.594
<v Speaker 4>to that were chiropractors that we're in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the middle of it and they realized it </v>

1485
01:03:35.371 --> 01:03:38.790
<v Speaker 4>was bullshit and they to stay and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>stayed because what the fuck do I do?</v>

1486
01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:41.250
<v Speaker 4>I have to get my money back for my </v>
<v Speaker 4>student loans and I'm like,</v>

1487
01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:42.750
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could have gone like,</v>

1488
01:03:42.751 --> 01:03:44.520
<v Speaker 4>you weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get like,</v>

1489
01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:46.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say this as someone who got into a lot</v>

1490
01:03:46.861 --> 01:03:49.890
<v Speaker 4>of debt for my real degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go and get another degree.</v>

1491
01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:50.723
<v Speaker 4>If you're smart enough to have gotten at</v>
<v Speaker 4>least your undergrad before you went to </v>

1492
01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:54.923
<v Speaker 4>Palmer chiropractic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have an undergrad before you go to </v>

1493
01:03:57.121 --> 01:03:58.060
<v Speaker 4>Palmer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chiropractor?</v>

1494
01:03:58.061 --> 01:04:00.330
<v Speaker 4>I believe so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>given that it's a doctorate program now,</v>

1495
01:04:00.331 --> 01:04:02.400
<v Speaker 4>one of the guys that I went to Undergrad</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

1496
01:04:02.401 --> 01:04:03.120
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

1497
01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.370
<v Speaker 4>he was smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had a biology degree and he was there</v>

1498
01:04:05.371 --> 01:04:06.204
<v Speaker 4>on scholarship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was one of the smarter kids in the </v>

1499
01:04:08.071 --> 01:04:09.680
<v Speaker 4>buyer program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there was,</v>

1500
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:10.603
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could have gotten a doctorate if he </v>

1501
01:04:13.351 --> 01:04:15.210
<v Speaker 4>wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went to Palmer.</v>

1502
01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.080
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1503
01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:17.770
<v Speaker 4>same school as some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1504
01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:22.170
<v Speaker 4>Kairos in this article and it was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like one of my editor that I worked with</v>

1505
01:04:22.171 --> 01:04:25.020
<v Speaker 4>on this piece asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the doctors that you're concentrating</v>

1506
01:04:25.021 --> 01:04:28.140
<v Speaker 4>on in this piece,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they the exception to the norm?</v>

1507
01:04:28.141 --> 01:04:30.480
<v Speaker 4>As is how regular chiropractors work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1508
01:04:30.481 --> 01:04:34.230
<v Speaker 4>let me go look at my friend from </v>
<v Speaker 4>college's a little chiropractic page.</v>

1509
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:36.360
<v Speaker 4>And I looked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he adjusts infants.</v>

1510
01:04:36.361 --> 01:04:40.230
<v Speaker 4>He claims that he can stop bed wedding </v>
<v Speaker 4>from adjusting a seven year old.</v>

1511
01:04:40.231 --> 01:04:41.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

1512
01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:42.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is.</v>

1513
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:44.160
<v Speaker 4>And like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sitting here going,</v>

1514
01:04:44.161 --> 01:04:44.994
<v Speaker 4>my God like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy that I went to school with who </v>

1515
01:04:47.191 --> 01:04:48.430
<v Speaker 4>seemed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1516
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.980
<v Speaker 4>he was smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

1517
01:04:49.981 --> 01:04:51.210
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

1518
01:04:51.211 --> 01:04:52.610
<v Speaker 4>I was kind of like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I wasn't,</v>

1519
01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:53.483
<v Speaker 4>it was hard to be mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just disappointed in this person </v>

1520
01:04:55.771 --> 01:04:57.900
<v Speaker 4>that I just stuck in this system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1521
01:04:57.901 --> 01:04:58.734
<v Speaker 4>is that like a bunch of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>also doing the same thing and they just </v>

1522
01:05:01.411 --> 01:05:02.244
<v Speaker 4>kind of get caught up in this idea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they hear it from a bunch of </v>

1523
01:05:05.161 --> 01:05:08.940
<v Speaker 4>people who they think are experts like </v>
<v Speaker 4>their teachers and they're going,</v>

1524
01:05:08.941 --> 01:05:09.774
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is accepted so we're going to take </v>

1525
01:05:10.651 --> 01:05:10.981
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1526
01:05:10.981 --> 01:05:11.814
<v Speaker 4>you know what if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I saw people in science like because </v>

1527
01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:15.960
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I promote a lot of things,</v>

1528
01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:17.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we might disagree on,</v>

1529
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:19.150
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I promote a lot of ideas in science that</v>

1530
01:05:19.151 --> 01:05:22.710
<v Speaker 4>I've seen the evidence for and I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it and we disagreed.</v>

1531
01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:25.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm seeing some dietary things I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>guess like,</v>

1532
01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:26.620
<v Speaker 4>cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can,</v>

1533
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:28.660
<v Speaker 4>we can hash that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what are,</v>

1534
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:30.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are your thoughts on Gmos?</v>

1535
01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:32.283
<v Speaker 4>Genetically Modified Foods is apparently</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost everything that you buy at the </v>

1536
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:36.330
<v Speaker 4>supermarket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1537
01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:38.110
<v Speaker 4>What did we agree on that then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably,</v>

1538
01:05:38.111 --> 01:05:40.690
<v Speaker 4>and it's like I think they know you by </v>
<v Speaker 4>every orange.</v>

1539
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.510
<v Speaker 4>If you look at a piece of corn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh it's organic.</v>

1540
01:05:43.511 --> 01:05:46.750
<v Speaker 4>That Shit is genetically modified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been modified for 100 years.</v>

1541
01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.160
<v Speaker 4>They're going to make me cry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tears.</v>

1542
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:49.750
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've talked.</v>

1543
01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:53.710
<v Speaker 4>You had Kevin Folta was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was so happy I had him on because he's</v>

1544
01:05:53.711 --> 01:05:57.130
<v Speaker 4>never in California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went out for dinner that night,</v>

1545
01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:57.993
<v Speaker 4>so it takes a lot of shit because </v>
<v Speaker 4>Monsanto is funded some of the studies </v>

1546
01:06:01.361 --> 01:06:03.610
<v Speaker 4>that they've done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the studies are real and the studies</v>

1547
01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:04.350
<v Speaker 4>of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1548
01:06:04.350 --> 01:06:06.070
<v Speaker 4>you can see the results.</v>

1549
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:07.780
<v Speaker 4>They're not manipulated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1550
01:06:07.781 --> 01:06:08.614
<v Speaker 4>Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

1551
01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:11.440
<v Speaker 4>Well actually no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they funded his communication program so</v>

1552
01:06:11.441 --> 01:06:12.274
<v Speaker 4>that he can come out and do things like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and they never funded any of his </v>

1553
01:06:16.061 --> 01:06:17.000
<v Speaker 4>research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1554
01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:18.550
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I misspoke.</v>

1555
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:19.060
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1556
01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:19.731
<v Speaker 4>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>

1557
01:06:19.731 --> 01:06:20.950
<v Speaker 4>But you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a.</v>

1558
01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.950
<v Speaker 4>and this is what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where he got a lot of shit was um,</v>

1559
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.830
<v Speaker 4>was that he said I have nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>with Monsanto.</v>

1560
01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:29.410
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like I think if he just said,</v>

1561
01:06:29.411 --> 01:06:30.244
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they fund my communication program </v>

1562
01:06:31.451 --> 01:06:33.670
<v Speaker 4>but they don't have anything to do with </v>
<v Speaker 4>my research.</v>

1563
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.713
<v Speaker 4>Nobody would have A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people still would have been </v>

1564
01:06:36.251 --> 01:06:37.084
<v Speaker 4>mad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think people would have been far </v>

1565
01:06:37.691 --> 01:06:38.524
<v Speaker 4>less mad and I feel so bad that he went </v>
<v Speaker 4>through everything with that because </v>

1566
01:06:41.681 --> 01:06:44.350
<v Speaker 4>there was anything with Monsanto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's tricky.</v>

1567
01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:45.523
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just took a tour there and I got hate </v>

1568
01:06:46.721 --> 01:06:48.190
<v Speaker 4>mail like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

1569
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:51.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean we were so careful because I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there for other business,</v>

1570
01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:52.180
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were like,</v>

1571
01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.013
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be out in,</v>

1572
01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:54.880
<v Speaker 4>in Missouri,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come have a tour.</v>

1573
01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:59.170
<v Speaker 4>Like they didn't pay to the star and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>had so much fun like it was,</v>

1574
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.033
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a lot of really cool tech </v>

1575
01:07:00.791 --> 01:07:04.300
<v Speaker 4>there and if you're ever in the area </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd gladly show you around.</v>

1576
01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.880
<v Speaker 4>So they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were nice to me and responding.</v>

1577
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:07.743
<v Speaker 4>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the rumors that I heard about </v>

1578
01:07:09.311 --> 01:07:11.710
<v Speaker 4>that was that they only have organic </v>
<v Speaker 4>food in the cafeteria.</v>

1579
01:07:11.711 --> 01:07:12.544
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking,</v>

1580
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking my camera around and taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>pictures of everything.</v>

1581
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:18.020
<v Speaker 4>The word organic is such a weird way </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

1582
01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.560
<v Speaker 4>It's like what's organic and what's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>now it's like,</v>

1583
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:21.483
<v Speaker 4>it's very clear definition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Organic uses pesticides and that's </v>

1584
01:07:24.881 --> 01:07:26.720
<v Speaker 4>something I think people see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1585
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:30.730
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was the whole point of organic.</v>

1586
01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:31.883
<v Speaker 4>You don't use pesticides or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there are some organic farmers </v>

1587
01:07:34.511 --> 01:07:39.370
<v Speaker 4>that don't use any google this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What defines organic food?</v>

1588
01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:42.580
<v Speaker 4>Let's find out what is the accepted </v>
<v Speaker 4>definition,</v>

1589
01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.530
<v Speaker 4>organic food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to hear it from me?</v>

1590
01:07:44.531 --> 01:07:46.960
<v Speaker 4>And then from Google to see if I'm at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1591
01:07:46.961 --> 01:07:51.700
<v Speaker 4>so organic food works by certain farming</v>
<v Speaker 4>stand or agricultural standards and they</v>

1592
01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:52.534
<v Speaker 4>can use certain pesticides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In most cases these pesticides are </v>

1593
01:07:56.501 --> 01:07:59.530
<v Speaker 4>derived from natural sources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not always,</v>

1594
01:07:59.531 --> 01:08:00.364
<v Speaker 4>but most of the time and some of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>pesticides include pesticides like </v>

1595
01:08:02.831 --> 01:08:05.370
<v Speaker 4>wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>known and the [inaudible] and also have,</v>

1596
01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:07.760
<v Speaker 4>if you're familiar with bt corn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1597
01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:08.993
<v Speaker 4>the bt toxin is also used in organic </v>
<v Speaker 4>farming for because it's a naturally </v>

1598
01:08:13.391 --> 01:08:15.250
<v Speaker 4>occurring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a toxin,</v>

1599
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:19.700
<v Speaker 4>it can be used and sprayed topically on </v>
<v Speaker 4>organic produce.</v>

1600
01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:20.773
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of these are the things that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>think of as just conventional farming </v>

1601
01:08:24.081 --> 01:08:26.600
<v Speaker 4>practices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely use in organic farming.</v>

1602
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:29.720
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make it any better or worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

1603
01:08:29.721 --> 01:08:30.554
<v Speaker 4>in a lot of cases it's a little more </v>
<v Speaker 4>expensive partially because of the </v>

1604
01:08:32.451 --> 01:08:35.930
<v Speaker 4>certification process and partially </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it uses older farming techniques</v>

1605
01:08:35.931 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 4>that need a little more land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that type of stuff.</v>

1606
01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:41.470
<v Speaker 4>It also uses a till farming practices </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you know,</v>

1607
01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:44.240
<v Speaker 4>digs up the ground a bit more and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kimberly's a little more co two,</v>

1608
01:08:44.241 --> 01:08:46.910
<v Speaker 4>so in general I tend to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1609
01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:47.430
<v Speaker 4>here we go.</v>

1610
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simply stated,</v>

1611
01:08:48.901 --> 01:08:52.740
<v Speaker 1>organic produce or other ingredients are</v>
<v Speaker 1>grown without the use of pesticides.</v>

1612
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Synthetic fertilizers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

1613
01:08:54.391 --> 01:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sewage sludge,</v>

1614
01:08:56.041 --> 01:08:59.880
<v Speaker 1>genetically modified organisms or </v>
<v Speaker 1>ionizing radiation.</v>

1615
01:08:59.881 --> 01:09:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Animals that produce meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poultry,</v>

1616
01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:02.940
<v Speaker 1>eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dairy products.</v>

1617
01:09:02.941 --> 01:09:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Do not take antibiotics or growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones to us.</v>

1618
01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.553
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

1619
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:08.181
<v Speaker 1>The U.</v>
<v Speaker 1>S,</v>

1620
01:09:08.181 --> 01:09:09.014
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a national organic program defines </v>

1621
01:09:11.221 --> 01:09:12.054
<v Speaker 1>organic as follows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Organic food is produced by farmers who </v>

1622
01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:15.984
<v Speaker 1>emphasize the use of renewable resources</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the conservation of soil and water </v>

1623
01:09:19.471 --> 01:09:22.110
<v Speaker 1>to enhance environmental quality for </v>
<v Speaker 1>future generations.</v>

1624
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:23.303
<v Speaker 1>Organic meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poultry and eggs and dairy products are </v>

1625
01:09:24.751 --> 01:09:27.510
<v Speaker 1>made from animals that are given no </v>
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics or growth hormones.</v>

1626
01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Organic food is produced without using </v>
<v Speaker 1>most conventional pesticides.</v>

1627
01:09:32.011 --> 01:09:32.844
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fertilizer is made with synthetic </v>

1628
01:09:34.651 --> 01:09:35.484
<v Speaker 1>ingredients or sewage sludge </v>
<v Speaker 1>bioengineering or ionizing radiation </v>

1629
01:09:39.150 --> 01:09:39.983
<v Speaker 1>before a product can be labeled organic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and quotes a government approved </v>

1630
01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:44.183
<v Speaker 1>certifier inspects the farm where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>food is grown to make sure the farmers </v>

1631
01:09:47.190 --> 01:09:50.480
<v Speaker 1>following all the rules necessary to </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet USD.</v>

1632
01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Organic standards,</v>

1633
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:53.443
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one thing on there that will </v>

1634
01:09:53.951 --> 01:09:56.470
<v Speaker 4>disagree with what their first paragraph</v>
<v Speaker 4>as they say,</v>

1635
01:09:56.471 --> 01:09:57.304
<v Speaker 4>without the use of pesticides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the second paragraph it says organic </v>

1636
01:10:00.311 --> 01:10:03.610
<v Speaker 4>food is produced without using most </v>
<v Speaker 4>conventional pesticides.</v>

1637
01:10:03.611 --> 01:10:06.190
<v Speaker 4>You see that slight little slight of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand</v>

1638
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.590
<v Speaker 1>because one of them is theirs and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other one is USD.</v>

1639
01:10:09.591 --> 01:10:11.190
<v Speaker 1>A little slider.</v>

1640
01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:14.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>

1641
01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.150
<v Speaker 4>if I may ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you.</v>

1642
01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:16.720
<v Speaker 4>Would you like to do.</v>

1643
01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Google will hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's Google what pesticides can be used</v>

1644
01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:22.323
<v Speaker 1>and still make it organic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what I was going to request a </v>

1645
01:10:26.261 --> 01:10:28.510
<v Speaker 1>organic pesticides approved for use in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the u.</v>

1646
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:33.910
<v Speaker 1>s we go now what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the fears of pesticides?</v>

1647
01:10:35.171 --> 01:10:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People worried about toxins getting into</v>

1648
01:10:37.571 --> 01:10:41.370
<v Speaker 1>their food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting in their body and cancer.</v>

1649
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

1650
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.360
<v Speaker 4>understand that fear partially because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>went through it quite a bit,</v>

1651
01:10:45.361 --> 01:10:46.194
<v Speaker 4>like when I got sick a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like my first symptom wasn't celiac </v>

1652
01:10:49.321 --> 01:10:51.390
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't my joints popping out.</v>

1653
01:10:51.570 --> 01:10:53.340
<v Speaker 4>I got the worst headache of my life one </v>
<v Speaker 4>day at it.</v>

1654
01:10:53.341 --> 01:10:54.174
<v Speaker 4>Never went away like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'll make you scared to death of </v>

1655
01:10:56.970 --> 01:10:59.640
<v Speaker 4>everything around you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I went organic,</v>

1656
01:10:59.641 --> 01:11:01.710
<v Speaker 4>I went Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went.</v>

1657
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:04.560
<v Speaker 4>I'd cut everything out of my diet </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was scared that,</v>

1658
01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:05.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get,</v>

1659
01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:08.490
<v Speaker 4>you feel like you're getting stabbed in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the eye constantly.</v>

1660
01:11:08.491 --> 01:11:10.140
<v Speaker 4>You're going to cut everything out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your diet.</v>

1661
01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.000
<v Speaker 4>This happened all at once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One day worse had it.</v>

1662
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:16.710
<v Speaker 4>I was working and at the time I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>working in the pesticide lab yet.</v>

1663
01:11:16.711 --> 01:11:20.850
<v Speaker 4>I was working in a drug analysis lab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm worried that that was what was going</v>

1664
01:11:20.851 --> 01:11:24.150
<v Speaker 4>on that absorbs that or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1665
01:11:24.151 --> 01:11:24.480
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

1666
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.640
<v Speaker 4>I was the thing that I was worried </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was.</v>

1667
01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:28.170
<v Speaker 4>At the time I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was.</v>

1668
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:31.350
<v Speaker 4>There was much more than the hits a day </v>
<v Speaker 4>I was.</v>

1669
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.450
<v Speaker 4>It was much more of me and there is here</v>
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

1670
01:11:33.451 --> 01:11:34.680
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm five,</v>

1671
01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:37.350
<v Speaker 4>nine and I at the time weighed almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>250 pounds.</v>

1672
01:11:37.351 --> 01:11:39.060
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I needed to lose a little of me,</v>

1673
01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:39.900
<v Speaker 4>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1674
01:11:39.901 --> 01:11:43.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm eating shitty food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should probably try eating healthier.</v>

1675
01:11:43.231 --> 01:11:45.240
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nevermind just more salads.</v>

1676
01:11:45.241 --> 01:11:46.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went organic.</v>

1677
01:11:46.471 --> 01:11:48.450
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just cut everything out of my diet.</v>

1678
01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.630
<v Speaker 4>So there was a bunch of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1679
01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.150
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't terry as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1680
01:11:53.151 --> 01:11:55.060
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I cut a lot of things out,</v>

1681
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:57.030
<v Speaker 4>started working out everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1682
01:11:57.031 --> 01:11:57.864
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still needed medication because it </v>

1683
01:11:58.831 --> 01:12:01.350
<v Speaker 4>turned out there was just um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a uh,</v>

1684
01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.213
<v Speaker 4>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had and we figured out the headache </v>

1685
01:12:03.811 --> 01:12:07.300
<v Speaker 4>was linked into the ehlers Danlos </v>
<v Speaker 4>Syndrome and there are some to,</v>

1686
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:08.220
<v Speaker 4>to clarify everything.</v>

1687
01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:09.670
<v Speaker 4>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they have one autoimmune,</v>

1688
01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:11.820
<v Speaker 4>they can tend to cluster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>

1689
01:12:11.821 --> 01:12:12.654
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1690
01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:14.700
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was lucky color 1 million.</v>

1691
01:12:14.701 --> 01:12:15.980
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was,</v>

1692
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:17.730
<v Speaker 4>that was the thing with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I tried,</v>

1693
01:12:17.731 --> 01:12:19.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked into this and I fell for all of</v>

1694
01:12:19.981 --> 01:12:20.611
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like so,</v>

1695
01:12:20.611 --> 01:12:24.420
<v Speaker 4>all of the pesticides are killing you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the toxin.</v>

1696
01:12:24.421 --> 01:12:25.254
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand the fear of the people who </v>

1697
01:12:27.031 --> 01:12:29.310
<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to cut toxins out of my diet.</v>

1698
01:12:29.530 --> 01:12:33.200
<v Speaker 4>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there any foundation in truth?</v>

1699
01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:36.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing bad for you?</v>

1700
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:36.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no pesticide.</v>

1701
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.823
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a little bit of truth that </v>

1702
01:12:39.841 --> 01:12:42.690
<v Speaker 4>sells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lie is what I will give this because</v>

1703
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:43.501
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1704
01:12:43.501 --> 01:12:44.334
<v Speaker 4>I used to work with bulk quantities of </v>
<v Speaker 4>pesticides at my last lab and that was </v>

1705
01:12:47.191 --> 01:12:48.024
<v Speaker 4>kind of what sealed the deal for me that</v>
<v Speaker 4>these when they're in your food are not </v>

1706
01:12:51.150 --> 01:12:51.983
<v Speaker 4>going to hurt you because the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>testing we had to go through and the </v>

1707
01:12:55.321 --> 01:12:56.154
<v Speaker 4>amount of regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think regulation in this case is a </v>

1708
01:12:57.631 --> 01:13:00.180
<v Speaker 4>good thing because it will stop a bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>pesticide,</v>

1709
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:01.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for making it to market.</v>

1710
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:05.460
<v Speaker 4>And I want that regulation there because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I eat the food too.</v>

1711
01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:09.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't want anyone's child to ever get </v>
<v Speaker 4>hurt from something that,</v>

1712
01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:11.970
<v Speaker 4>that me or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I don't work there anymore.</v>

1713
01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:12.804
<v Speaker 4>But you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I had any work and getting on the </v>

1714
01:13:15.331 --> 01:13:17.160
<v Speaker 4>market,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to ever want that to be the</v>

1715
01:13:17.161 --> 01:13:17.994
<v Speaker 4>case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but once upon a time the pesticides we </v>

1716
01:13:19.951 --> 01:13:20.784
<v Speaker 4>had on the market were much less </v>
<v Speaker 4>targeted to hurting the weeds and could </v>

1717
01:13:23.971 --> 01:13:24.804
<v Speaker 4>hurt people too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like arson are cynical's a sulfuric </v>

1718
01:13:27.391 --> 01:13:29.010
<v Speaker 4>acid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those were early pesticides,</v>

1719
01:13:29.011 --> 01:13:29.731
<v Speaker 4>Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>green,</v>

1720
01:13:29.731 --> 01:13:31.400
<v Speaker 4>totally toxic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially to,</v>

1721
01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the farmers and to the,</v>

1722
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:37.350
<v Speaker 4>even to the farm equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the stuff we have now far less toxic and</v>

1723
01:13:37.351 --> 01:13:40.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean people used far less though </v>
<v Speaker 4>toxic.</v>

1724
01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:41.013
<v Speaker 4>It's in me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to qualify this answer and I </v>

1725
01:13:43.321 --> 01:13:44.154
<v Speaker 4>mean I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not qualifying it to back off from </v>

1726
01:13:45.391 --> 01:13:46.224
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everything is toxic in some dosage </v>

1727
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.330
<v Speaker 4>so water will kill you.</v>

1728
01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.800
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so roundup is one that people are really</v>

1729
01:13:52.801 --> 01:13:53.634
<v Speaker 4>scared of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one that a lot of people know </v>

1730
01:13:54.331 --> 01:13:57.850
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a great graph on,</v>

1731
01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:00.720
<v Speaker 4>on the showing how less toxic it is than</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1732
01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.670
<v Speaker 4>than the pesticides that replaced </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we weren't,</v>

1733
01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:05.460
<v Speaker 4>we didn't go from using no pesticide to </v>
<v Speaker 4>using roundup.</v>

1734
01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:06.553
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know someone's gonna correct me </v>

1735
01:14:07.141 --> 01:14:08.450
<v Speaker 4>saying it's an herbicide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

1736
01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:11.130
<v Speaker 4>herbicide is pesticides the blanket </v>
<v Speaker 4>term,</v>

1737
01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:13.780
<v Speaker 4>all things that killed a stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 4>farming.</v>

1738
01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:15.820
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so before,</v>

1739
01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:18.450
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before roundup,</v>

1740
01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:21.490
<v Speaker 4>I believe the one we used with Cyanna </v>
<v Speaker 4>azine I could be wrong on this,</v>

1741
01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:25.570
<v Speaker 4>but the one we used before roundup was </v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of the ld 50,</v>

1742
01:14:25.571 --> 01:14:28.180
<v Speaker 4>the lethal dose for about 50 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the population.</v>

1743
01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:33.400
<v Speaker 4>It was 10 times higher than roundup and </v>
<v Speaker 4>now we barely sell any of it.</v>

1744
01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:34.503
<v Speaker 4>So we just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the issue just lethal dose or toxic </v>

1745
01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:41.020
<v Speaker 4>toxicity that affects your body cancer.</v>

1746
01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:41.820
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1747
01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:42.653
<v Speaker 4>and I understand that's a question that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people keep coming back to and part of </v>

1748
01:14:46.151 --> 01:14:46.984
<v Speaker 4>the reason that people are suspicious of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is because of its use with the GMO </v>

1749
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:50.943
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these things go through hundreds of </v>

1750
01:14:52.991 --> 01:14:53.824
<v Speaker 4>tests and years of testing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because of the suspicion with </v>

1751
01:14:55.661 --> 01:14:58.190
<v Speaker 4>roundup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gone through continual testing,</v>

1752
01:14:58.191 --> 01:15:00.010
<v Speaker 4>like they've tested to see if it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1753
01:15:00.011 --> 01:15:02.110
<v Speaker 4>if it accumulates in breast milk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does not.</v>

1754
01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:03.203
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've tested to see if it causes </v>

1755
01:15:04.421 --> 01:15:06.100
<v Speaker 4>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't seem to.</v>

1756
01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.270
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they've tried,</v>

1757
01:15:07.271 --> 01:15:11.050
<v Speaker 4>they've used it at higher doses of mice </v>
<v Speaker 4>and rats.</v>

1758
01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:11.820
<v Speaker 4>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've,</v>

1759
01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:12.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've tested in humans.</v>

1760
01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:17.980
<v Speaker 4>It's been on the market for 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean like it's been in the population or</v>

1761
01:15:19.421 --> 01:15:20.254
<v Speaker 4>it's been used now for I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>25 years and there doesn't seem to be </v>

1762
01:15:23.921 --> 01:15:24.754
<v Speaker 4>the only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only apparent increase in cancer is </v>

1763
01:15:27.071 --> 01:15:28.450
<v Speaker 4>because we're living longer now.</v>

1764
01:15:28.450 --> 01:15:30.550
<v Speaker 4>And when you have any population that </v>
<v Speaker 4>lives longer,</v>

1765
01:15:30.551 --> 01:15:34.060
<v Speaker 4>you have increased incidence of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we're not dying from polio anymore.</v>

1766
01:15:34.061 --> 01:15:34.894
<v Speaker 4>So we're dying from something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately we're not gonna live </v>

1767
01:15:37.361 --> 01:15:38.520
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1768
01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:39.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1769
01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:40.213
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1770
01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.193
<v Speaker 4>there's a toxicity issue when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>to roundup or when it comes to any sort </v>

1771
01:15:47.891 --> 01:15:50.110
<v Speaker 4>of pesticide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're talking about herbicides,</v>

1772
01:15:50.111 --> 01:15:52.180
<v Speaker 4>herbicides are what kills the plants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1773
01:15:52.181 --> 01:15:55.330
<v Speaker 4>Kills Weeds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kills bugs that are pests.</v>

1774
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:57.280
<v Speaker 4>Pesticides are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the blanket term.</v>

1775
01:15:57.281 --> 01:15:59.890
<v Speaker 4>Insecticide kills bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So pesticides,</v>

1776
01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.600
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole blanket term.</v>

1777
01:16:01.601 --> 01:16:02.434
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1778
01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.393
<v Speaker 4>So what is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the most controversial is that </v>

1779
01:16:05.801 --> 01:16:08.410
<v Speaker 4>roundup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roundup is controversial and I think the</v>

1780
01:16:08.411 --> 01:16:11.260
<v Speaker 4>reason that it became controversial is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because people heard,</v>

1781
01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:12.283
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to genetically modify the </v>

1782
01:16:13.301 --> 01:16:17.230
<v Speaker 4>plants so that the roundup doesn't kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>the plant and it's this whole thing just</v>

1783
01:16:17.231 --> 01:16:20.290
<v Speaker 4>to make money for Monsanto and how dare </v>
<v Speaker 4>you make money.</v>

1784
01:16:20.530 --> 01:16:21.490
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

1785
01:16:21.491 --> 01:16:25.960
<v Speaker 4>I think that was why people got mad was </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the genetic modification.</v>

1786
01:16:25.961 --> 01:16:27.680
<v Speaker 4>Lincoln with roundup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1787
01:16:27.681 --> 01:16:28.271
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1788
01:16:28.271 --> 01:16:30.590
<v Speaker 4>it's a new technology or it's one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1789
01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.433
<v Speaker 4>it's a newer technology and it kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>made people a little aware of farming </v>

1790
01:16:35.621 --> 01:16:36.454
<v Speaker 4>for the first time and net.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I go to farming conferences a lot </v>

1791
01:16:38.861 --> 01:16:39.694
<v Speaker 4>of times to talk about how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate agriculture and I'll sit </v>

1792
01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.320
<v Speaker 4>down and ask farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1793
01:16:44.321 --> 01:16:46.540
<v Speaker 4>what are you plant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are you planting it,</v>

1794
01:16:46.541 --> 01:16:50.740
<v Speaker 4>what do you think of Gmos you use </v>
<v Speaker 4>roundup and do you buy from people other</v>

1795
01:16:50.741 --> 01:16:51.574
<v Speaker 4>than do you buy for Monsanto?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And do you buy from people other than </v>

1796
01:16:53.681 --> 01:16:54.514
<v Speaker 4>Monsanto?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that handful of questions will tell </v>

1797
01:16:57.191 --> 01:16:57.850
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1798
01:16:57.850 --> 01:16:58.361
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>

1799
01:16:58.361 --> 01:17:00.660
<v Speaker 4>I wish I had more videos of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like there's,</v>

1800
01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:01.543
<v Speaker 4>there's a video at some point on my site</v>
<v Speaker 4>with two farmers who buy from Monsanto </v>

1801
01:17:05.501 --> 01:17:09.680
<v Speaker 4>and buy from other companies and one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the reasons I asked is because there's a</v>

1802
01:17:09.681 --> 01:17:11.570
<v Speaker 4>rumor on the Internet that if you buy </v>
<v Speaker 4>from Monsanto,</v>

1803
01:17:11.571 --> 01:17:13.670
<v Speaker 4>you can only buy for Monsanto.</v>

1804
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:16.370
<v Speaker 4>Just not true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1805
01:17:16.371 --> 01:17:17.030
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1806
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:19.580
<v Speaker 4>every genetically modified crop is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1807
01:17:19.581 --> 01:17:20.390
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1808
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:22.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just is made to be roundup ready.</v>

1809
01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.080
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not true,</v>

1810
01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:25.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you know,</v>

1811
01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:26.180
<v Speaker 4>that people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1812
01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.120
<v Speaker 4>are being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1813
01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:31.850
<v Speaker 4>that people are dying of cancer from </v>
<v Speaker 4>just being around roundup.</v>

1814
01:17:31.851 --> 01:17:36.470
<v Speaker 4>And recently they found that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reports that went through the IRC,</v>

1815
01:17:36.471 --> 01:17:37.304
<v Speaker 4>the cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the place that declares things </v>

1816
01:17:38.841 --> 01:17:39.760
<v Speaker 4>cancerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1817
01:17:39.761 --> 01:17:40.461
<v Speaker 4>on their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1818
01:17:40.461 --> 01:17:43.490
<v Speaker 4>Group A,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one to a two hub,</v>

1819
01:17:43.810 --> 01:17:44.990
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer,</v>

1820
01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:46.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>classifications.</v>

1821
01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:51.410
<v Speaker 4>One of the reports was falsified that </v>
<v Speaker 4>declared roundup a cancerous.</v>

1822
01:17:51.411 --> 01:17:54.530
<v Speaker 4>Now we also have to follow that up by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the person who is.</v>

1823
01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:55.573
<v Speaker 4>I'm I have to hunt down this report,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the person who was trying to say </v>

1824
01:17:58.581 --> 01:17:59.414
<v Speaker 4>roundup is cancer because of a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit of suspicion around it because it's </v>

1825
01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:03.944
<v Speaker 4>been people have kicked around that it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>causing cancer or you know that your </v>

1826
01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:10.310
<v Speaker 4>spleen to turn radioactive for you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>

1827
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:12.590
<v Speaker 4>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So is this like chem trails type thing?</v>

1828
01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:17.090
<v Speaker 4>A little bit like one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people talk about in terms of conspiracy</v>

1829
01:18:17.091 --> 01:18:17.924
<v Speaker 4>theory and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets put into the public sphere so </v>

1830
01:18:19.641 --> 01:18:21.950
<v Speaker 4>much that people start to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here's the.</v>

1831
01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:26.210
<v Speaker 4>If I saw from evidence that roundup had </v>
<v Speaker 4>caused issues,</v>

1832
01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.580
<v Speaker 4>I would say right away just get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1833
01:18:28.581 --> 01:18:32.210
<v Speaker 4>take it off the market and I keep on not</v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing from evidence of it.</v>

1834
01:18:32.211 --> 01:18:33.860
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a study,</v>

1835
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:38.150
<v Speaker 4>there's this group moms across our moms </v>
<v Speaker 4>across America and it's.</v>

1836
01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.133
<v Speaker 4>I take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always get my scientific information </v>

1837
01:18:40.791 --> 01:18:41.624
<v Speaker 4>for mom groups on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this group decided to do a breast </v>

1838
01:18:45.171 --> 01:18:47.750
<v Speaker 4>milk study to see if roundup accumulated</v>
<v Speaker 4>in breast milk.</v>

1839
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.823
<v Speaker 4>And the way the study was done was they </v>
<v Speaker 4>just had women indiscriminately sending </v>

1840
01:18:53.091 --> 01:18:55.640
<v Speaker 4>containers of breast milk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1841
01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:56.990
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to them.</v>

1842
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.823
<v Speaker 4>And they declared like the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>roundup to be ridiculously high in the </v>

1843
01:19:02.151 --> 01:19:03.140
<v Speaker 4>breast milk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

1844
01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:07.020
<v Speaker 4>did they just tell women to spray pump </v>
<v Speaker 4>bottles of,</v>

1845
01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:07.993
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of roundup into these containers and </v>

1846
01:19:09.561 --> 01:19:10.820
<v Speaker 4>then test it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it turned out.</v>

1847
01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:13.790
<v Speaker 4>And this just from knowing how </v>
<v Speaker 4>analytical techniques work,</v>

1848
01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:14.624
<v Speaker 4>like I used to design the techniques by </v>
<v Speaker 4>which we extracted a target pesticides </v>

1849
01:19:18.981 --> 01:19:20.380
<v Speaker 4>from a matrix and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1850
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:23.780
<v Speaker 4>analyze them on our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on our big overpriced machinery.</v>

1851
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:26.630
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a woman who is a breast milk,</v>

1852
01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:30.260
<v Speaker 4>a researcher out of a University of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Washington was like,</v>

1853
01:19:30.261 --> 01:19:35.030
<v Speaker 4>this doesn't seem right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she designed an experiment to test if</v>

1854
01:19:35.031 --> 01:19:36.710
<v Speaker 4>roundup was accumulating and breast </v>
<v Speaker 4>milk.</v>

1855
01:19:36.711 --> 01:19:39.950
<v Speaker 4>And she had it verified by an out by an </v>
<v Speaker 4>independent lab,</v>

1856
01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:40.780
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>

1857
01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:41.613
<v Speaker 4>and they tested women specifically who </v>
<v Speaker 4>worked in agriculture and she had their </v>

1858
01:19:44.601 --> 01:19:45.434
<v Speaker 4>breast milk tested specifically on days </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they were spraying roundup and </v>

1859
01:19:48.831 --> 01:19:49.970
<v Speaker 4>there was nothing found.</v>

1860
01:19:50.010 --> 01:19:51.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's someone who's not necessarily</v>

1861
01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:55.370
<v Speaker 4>eating the food that someone is working </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the food working with roundup.</v>

1862
01:19:55.371 --> 01:19:56.204
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you would expect that if it was </v>

1863
01:19:57.081 --> 01:19:59.870
<v Speaker 4>being sprayed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they go to this way round the issue</v>

1864
01:19:59.871 --> 01:20:01.320
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interrupt you.</v>

1865
01:20:01.321 --> 01:20:03.530
<v Speaker 4>But the issue is people eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's both.</v>

1866
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:05.660
<v Speaker 4>Think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's in the food supply,</v>

1867
01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.500
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't they be eating as well?</v>

1868
01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:08.393
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what their diet is like if </v>

1869
01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:10.434
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're getting it from people's </v>

1870
01:20:11.131 --> 01:20:11.964
<v Speaker 4>breast milk and those people say there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>roundup in my breast milk and I've been </v>

1871
01:20:15.451 --> 01:20:17.830
<v Speaker 4>eating genetically modified crops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

1872
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:18.833
<v Speaker 4>Well the other question is if these are </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that are following a moms </v>

1873
01:20:21.511 --> 01:20:24.750
<v Speaker 4>across America and their whole thing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that roundup is the devil.</v>

1874
01:20:24.751 --> 01:20:26.460
<v Speaker 4>So you think they're falsifying </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence?</v>

1875
01:20:26.490 --> 01:20:27.323
<v Speaker 4>I think that it was not a well </v>
<v Speaker 4>controlled experiment and it will be </v>

1876
01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:32.220
<v Speaker 4>interesting to see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1877
01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:33.263
<v Speaker 4>to see how the experiment would come out</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the person who runs moms across </v>

1878
01:20:39.151 --> 01:20:41.300
<v Speaker 4>America is and honeycut would work </v>
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>

1879
01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:42.773
<v Speaker 4>how it would look if zen were to look in</v>
<v Speaker 4>on every step of the process with a </v>

1880
01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.680
<v Speaker 4>Shelly Mcguire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr Kelly Mcguire to see that,</v>

1881
01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:50.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1882
01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:51.323
<v Speaker 4>these people ate food that should have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been sprayed with roundup and worked in </v>

1883
01:20:54.751 --> 01:20:55.584
<v Speaker 4>the field and then at the end to see if </v>
<v Speaker 4>their breast milk came out with nothing </v>

1884
01:20:58.801 --> 01:20:59.070
<v Speaker 4>in it.</v>

1885
01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:00.270
<v Speaker 4>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you,</v>

1886
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:06.500
<v Speaker 4>don't you think that there'd be more </v>
<v Speaker 4>likely to be some sort of conspiratorial</v>

1887
01:21:07.651 --> 01:21:08.484
<v Speaker 4>collusion with people that actually work</v>
<v Speaker 4>in farms that use roundup rather than </v>

1888
01:21:12.901 --> 01:21:15.560
<v Speaker 4>someone who's just checking the breast </v>
<v Speaker 4>milk.</v>

1889
01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:16.513
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't you think that like if </v>

1890
01:21:16.951 --> 01:21:17.784
<v Speaker 4>someone's trying to prove that roundup </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't showing up in breast milk and </v>

1891
01:21:20.521 --> 01:21:24.120
<v Speaker 4>you've got a bunch of people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're living relies on using roundup?</v>

1892
01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:25.680
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the farm workers themselves,</v>

1893
01:21:25.770 --> 01:21:27.000
<v Speaker 4>they'd want to be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1894
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:30.960
<v Speaker 4>And I say that as someone who's worked </v>
<v Speaker 4>at a pesticide company and when I worked</v>

1895
01:21:30.961 --> 01:21:31.794
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was,</v>

1896
01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:32.783
<v Speaker 4>I was just an analytical chemist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not someone who had any investment </v>

1897
01:21:35.821 --> 01:21:38.790
<v Speaker 4>in keeping that company safe from being </v>
<v Speaker 4>yelled at.</v>

1898
01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:41.370
<v Speaker 4>I want it to be safe from the stuff I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was working with.</v>

1899
01:21:41.371 --> 01:21:42.204
<v Speaker 4>But I found it weird that you feel like </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some sort of conspiracy with </v>

1900
01:21:44.281 --> 01:21:46.410
<v Speaker 4>these moms that are checking their </v>
<v Speaker 4>breast milk,</v>

1901
01:21:46.411 --> 01:21:47.244
<v Speaker 4>but you don't think there might possibly</v>
<v Speaker 4>be some shenanigans involved in the </v>

1902
01:21:50.431 --> 01:21:53.520
<v Speaker 4>people that actually need roundup to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make a living.</v>

1903
01:21:53.810 --> 01:21:54.643
<v Speaker 4>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand what you're saying for </v>

1904
01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:56.244
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But part of the reason why I think that </v>

1905
01:21:58.470 --> 01:22:02.490
<v Speaker 4>Dr Mcguire would have conducted a better</v>
<v Speaker 4>study was number one,</v>

1906
01:22:02.491 --> 01:22:03.324
<v Speaker 4>in independently verified a number two </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows how to do collection evidence are </v>

1907
01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:11.430
<v Speaker 4>not ambulance a specimen collection </v>
<v Speaker 4>accurately and number three,</v>

1908
01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:15.030
<v Speaker 4>monitored and independently verified </v>
<v Speaker 4>from an outside lab.</v>

1909
01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.130
<v Speaker 4>So it's like we don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when,</v>

1910
01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:20.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when moms across America was asked,</v>

1911
01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.073
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to show their data and how they </v>

1912
01:22:22.861 --> 01:22:26.380
<v Speaker 4>collected the samples they didn't give,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they weren't willing to,</v>

1913
01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.090
<v Speaker 4>to share,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1914
01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:28.973
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of their data on how specimen </v>

1915
01:22:30.901 --> 01:22:32.130
<v Speaker 4>collection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1916
01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:33.023
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was excuse for not sharing that I don't </v>

1917
01:22:36.001 --> 01:22:37.920
<v Speaker 4>recall off the top of my head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they weren't like,</v>

1918
01:22:37.921 --> 01:22:38.754
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems suspicious to me that they </v>

1919
01:22:39.631 --> 01:22:43.110
<v Speaker 4>weren't willing to disclose that when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1920
01:22:43.111 --> 01:22:44.520
<v Speaker 4>when you do an experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

1921
01:22:44.521 --> 01:22:46.590
<v Speaker 4>And I mean I used to work under glp </v>
<v Speaker 4>standards,</v>

1922
01:22:46.591 --> 01:22:49.200
<v Speaker 4>which basically you throw out a glove,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to write it down.</v>

1923
01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:52.140
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's part of the standards and how you</v>

1924
01:22:52.141 --> 01:22:52.801
<v Speaker 4>get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1925
01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:53.634
<v Speaker 4>a chemical into a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into use in agriculture is you really </v>

1926
01:22:57.241 --> 01:23:02.241
<v Speaker 4>have to be careful and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and forthcoming on how you do your work.</v>

1927
01:23:02.821 --> 01:23:06.340
<v Speaker 4>Which was the amount of pesticides that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they in breast milk uniform.</v>

1928
01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:08.500
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that I didn't,</v>

1929
01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:12.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there were only testing </v>
<v Speaker 4>for roundup and they found there to be.</v>

1930
01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:15.280
<v Speaker 4>They didn't find there to be even trace </v>
<v Speaker 4>amounts,</v>

1931
01:23:15.281 --> 01:23:16.114
<v Speaker 4>which I was kind of surprised that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have expected something in the </v>

1932
01:23:18.810 --> 01:23:21.040
<v Speaker 4>moms across America stuff they found a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot.</v>

1933
01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:22.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the uniform?</v>

1934
01:23:22.121 --> 01:23:22.954
<v Speaker 4>Was it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did everybody have like a similar </v>

1935
01:23:23.591 --> 01:23:24.250
<v Speaker 4>amount?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1936
01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:26.560
<v Speaker 4>they found in the amount of varied and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

1937
01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:28.240
<v Speaker 4>they were so high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

1938
01:23:28.241 --> 01:23:29.860
<v Speaker 4>it was just somebody dripped some in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1939
01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:32.050
<v Speaker 4>It was suspicious and that's why I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1940
01:23:32.051 --> 01:23:34.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't like that was why I didn't buy </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1941
01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:36.010
<v Speaker 4>The other thing is they used a </v>
<v Speaker 4>technique,</v>

1942
01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:37.083
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an analytical technique that was used </v>

1943
01:23:38.621 --> 01:23:39.454
<v Speaker 4>for water and that's why I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not like not all techniques you </v>

1944
01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:45.040
<v Speaker 4>use for all work for all chemical </v>
<v Speaker 4>matrices.</v>

1945
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:47.410
<v Speaker 4>So that's another reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1946
01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a different lab,</v>

1947
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:49.623
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was probably better equipped to handle </v>

1948
01:23:51.401 --> 01:23:52.234
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One specifically that analyzes breast </v>

1949
01:23:53.141 --> 01:23:54.100
<v Speaker 4>milk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1950
01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:56.590
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think like the other thing is,</v>

1951
01:23:56.591 --> 01:23:57.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the other lab,</v>

1952
01:23:58.300 --> 01:23:59.133
<v Speaker 4>the other lab kind of had a bias going </v>
<v Speaker 4>in because their whole thing is how </v>

1953
01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:03.600
<v Speaker 4>roundup is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So lab,</v>

1954
01:24:03.601 --> 01:24:05.230
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to know if,</v>

1955
01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:07.180
<v Speaker 4>you know moms are being harmed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's breast,</v>

1956
01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.073
<v Speaker 4>if there's something in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the breastmilk that seems like a lab </v>

1957
01:24:11.561 --> 01:24:12.011
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1958
01:24:12.011 --> 01:24:16.060
<v Speaker 4>went in just wanting to know the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>lab went in saying I hate roundup.</v>

1959
01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.780
<v Speaker 4>So if I would have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1960
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:19.703
<v Speaker 4>if roundup had been found in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the test that Dr Mcguire's lab had </v>

1961
01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:24.124
<v Speaker 4>done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have happily accepted those </v>

1962
01:24:25.481 --> 01:24:27.730
<v Speaker 4>results because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it almost wouldn't.</v>

1963
01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:32.140
<v Speaker 4>It would have surprised me not in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>least if it had been found,</v>

1964
01:24:32.141 --> 01:24:32.974
<v Speaker 4>but I was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was Kinda glad that there was nothing </v>

1965
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:36.400
<v Speaker 4>there because it means that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1966
01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:40.750
<v Speaker 4>babies aren't getting a concentrated </v>
<v Speaker 4>dose of this just because you know,</v>

1967
01:24:40.751 --> 01:24:44.020
<v Speaker 4>you don't want extraneous chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 4>going into the food supply.</v>

1968
01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:46.480
<v Speaker 4>Only testing people that worked in these</v>
<v Speaker 4>farms.</v>

1969
01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:47.590
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that the idea?</v>

1970
01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.980
<v Speaker 4>I think they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember off the top of my head,</v>

1971
01:24:50.981 --> 01:24:52.600
<v Speaker 4>but I know one of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the groups,</v>

1972
01:24:52.601 --> 01:24:55.540
<v Speaker 4>they did test for women on testing days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they go to this way.</v>

1973
01:24:55.541 --> 01:24:57.070
<v Speaker 4>They're not just spraying it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're also,</v>

1974
01:24:57.150 --> 01:24:59.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly eating food that's been a,</v>

1975
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.930
<v Speaker 4>that's added on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's possibly,</v>

1976
01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:02.873
<v Speaker 4>it would be more interested in seeing it</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 percent sure that these people were </v>

1977
01:25:06.251 --> 01:25:07.084
<v Speaker 4>eating food that makes sense with </v>
<v Speaker 4>roundup and that doesn't make sense to </v>

1978
01:25:09.911 --> 01:25:10.990
<v Speaker 4>me that they didn't do that.</v>

1979
01:25:11.130 --> 01:25:11.740
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1980
01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:12.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1981
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:14.430
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to have a look at the study again</v>

1982
01:25:14.450 --> 01:25:15.340
<v Speaker 4>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to be,</v>

1983
01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:18.520
<v Speaker 4>just to be sure of what the weather </v>
<v Speaker 4>conditions were before.</v>

1984
01:25:18.521 --> 01:25:21.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm curious about both tests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have a,</v>

1985
01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:22.190
<v Speaker 4>have a look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1986
01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:27.320
<v Speaker 4>we can have a quick peek a after it for </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr Maguire breastmilk roundup study,</v>

1987
01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:29.423
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing seems a little weird to </v>

1988
01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:31.024
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird that one group test group </v>

1989
01:25:34.421 --> 01:25:35.440
<v Speaker 4>test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not at all.</v>

1990
01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:37.330
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

1991
01:25:37.450 --> 01:25:42.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say it is easy to screw up </v>
<v Speaker 4>a study,</v>

1992
01:25:42.011 --> 01:25:43.090
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>using,</v>

1993
01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:46.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're not sure the parameters you're</v>

1994
01:25:46.061 --> 01:25:48.100
<v Speaker 4>supposed to use in an analytical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1995
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:48.943
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a chemical analysis a thing because </v>

1996
01:25:51.431 --> 01:25:52.264
<v Speaker 4>you can have interfering species that </v>
<v Speaker 4>come up with the same peaks at the same </v>

1997
01:25:54.341 --> 01:25:55.480
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1998
01:25:55.481 --> 01:25:56.950
<v Speaker 4>so I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other thing is,</v>

1999
01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:57.670
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2000
01:25:57.670 --> 01:25:58.503
<v Speaker 4>the biggest thing is we don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 4>collection parameters for the one that </v>

2001
01:26:01.271 --> 01:26:04.180
<v Speaker 4>mom across America did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they won't tell us.</v>

2002
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:05.323
<v Speaker 4>It's the other thing is Dr Maguire was </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it through a university and she </v>

2003
01:26:08.991 --> 01:26:10.970
<v Speaker 4>could've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she could've been in a lot of trouble if</v>

2004
01:26:10.971 --> 01:26:11.804
<v Speaker 4>she'd a falsified a or data or done or </v>
<v Speaker 4>done a test that was purposefully </v>

2005
01:26:17.031 --> 01:26:17.980
<v Speaker 4>misleading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2006
01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:19.063
<v Speaker 4>So that's what are the pesticides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you google the best asides that are </v>

2007
01:26:21.951 --> 01:26:22.650
<v Speaker 4>acceptable</v>

2008
01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:24.020
<v Speaker 5>as a firm?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The put them up.</v>

2009
01:26:25.090 --> 01:26:27.000
<v Speaker 5>There's a long list somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

2010
01:26:27.001 --> 01:26:31.120
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had it here.</v>

2011
01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:35.130
<v Speaker 5>It's on the usaid or USD,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a good.gov website.</v>

2012
01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:36.023
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a standards of what they use </v>

2013
01:26:37.271 --> 01:26:38.104
<v Speaker 5>to put stuff on and off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there are a organic standards that </v>

2014
01:26:42.721 --> 01:26:43.554
<v Speaker 5>allow some substances,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but where they're mostly trying to get </v>

2015
01:26:45.631 --> 01:26:47.250
<v Speaker 5>out synthetic substances.</v>
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

2016
01:26:47.251 --> 01:26:50.070
<v Speaker 5>there are also some synthetic substances</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are allowed to.</v>

2017
01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:53.910
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is to label something organic,</v>

2018
01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:54.773
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there's a board that votes on </v>

2019
01:26:55.531 --> 01:26:56.364
<v Speaker 5>it from time to time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If somebody wants to bring something up </v>

2020
01:26:57.931 --> 01:27:00.240
<v Speaker 5>and disagree that it shouldn't be on </v>
<v Speaker 5>that list.</v>

2021
01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.480
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that weird though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2022
01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:05.860
<v Speaker 3>most people think you say organic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people think there's no pesticides.</v>

2023
01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:07.750
<v Speaker 3>Most people think you're just growing </v>
<v Speaker 3>plants.</v>

2024
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:10.130
<v Speaker 4>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's I.</v>

2025
01:27:10.570 --> 01:27:12.760
<v Speaker 4>They sell that so well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't they?</v>

2026
01:27:13.150 --> 01:27:13.983
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2027
01:27:14.490 --> 01:27:17.520
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Mons pheromones,</v>

2028
01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:20.280
<v Speaker 3>pheromones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pheromones,</v>

2029
01:27:20.490 --> 01:27:22.080
<v Speaker 3>pheromones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pheromones.</v>

2030
01:27:22.081 --> 01:27:22.914
<v Speaker 3>Have long been used as effective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nontoxic ways to confuse insects that </v>

2031
01:27:28.261 --> 01:27:31.890
<v Speaker 3>might otherwise infest organic crops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially fruit,</v>

2032
01:27:32.130 --> 01:27:36.030
<v Speaker 3>so they put some certain smells just </v>
<v Speaker 3>free bugs out.</v>

2033
01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vaccines for animals are important.</v>

2034
01:27:39.241 --> 01:27:42.750
<v Speaker 3>Disease Prevention tools against many </v>
<v Speaker 3>infectious diseases,</v>

2035
01:27:42.751 --> 01:27:43.051
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2036
01:27:43.051 --> 01:27:43.884
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially since antibiotic therapy is </v>

2037
01:27:44.881 --> 01:27:46.020
<v Speaker 3>prohibited in livestock.</v>

2038
01:27:46.630 --> 01:27:47.463
<v Speaker 4>Picturing an anti-vaxxer staying away </v>
<v Speaker 4>from organic produce because they </v>

2039
01:27:50.321 --> 01:27:52.060
<v Speaker 4>vaccinated it against bees.</v>

2040
01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:53.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can always grow your own food,</v>

2041
01:27:53.491 --> 01:27:54.380
<v Speaker 3>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2042
01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:55.613
<v Speaker 3>and not put anything on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think large scale domestic </v>

2043
01:27:58.441 --> 01:27:59.274
<v Speaker 3>agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're talking about these gigantic </v>

2044
01:28:01.201 --> 01:28:03.330
<v Speaker 3>fields,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing could be less natural.</v>

2045
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:06.720
<v Speaker 3>It's not normal to have a thousand acres</v>
<v Speaker 3>of corn.</v>

2046
01:28:06.810 --> 01:28:09.240
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't exist in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you do that,</v>

2047
01:28:09.241 --> 01:28:10.440
<v Speaker 3>you're going to run into a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

2048
01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:11.333
<v Speaker 4>Since I always go back to the argument </v>
<v Speaker 4>of nothing we're doing is natural </v>

2049
01:28:13.441 --> 01:28:15.390
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're sitting in a,</v>

2050
01:28:15.391 --> 01:28:18.700
<v Speaker 4>in an air conditioned studio in </v>
<v Speaker 4>California that we.</v>

2051
01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:19.553
<v Speaker 4>We'd probably be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd be dead with a lot of the things </v>

2052
01:28:21.511 --> 01:28:23.380
<v Speaker 4>that we don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2053
01:28:23.410 --> 01:28:25.830
<v Speaker 4>that's Kebab food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no food around here.</v>

2054
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:27.610
<v Speaker 4>Where are you growing food?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

2055
01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.260
<v Speaker 4>No one's grown food anywhere near us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2056
01:28:29.290 --> 01:28:30.123
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing that we enjoy that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's natural anymore as natural and </v>

2057
01:28:34.411 --> 01:28:36.570
<v Speaker 4>it's God damn delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got a freezer.</v>

2058
01:28:36.630 --> 01:28:39.920
<v Speaker 4>How do you get a freezer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I like.</v>

2059
01:28:39.921 --> 01:28:42.980
<v Speaker 4>You want natural bear attacks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Asteroids.</v>

01:28:43.050 --> 01:28:44.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a little sticker.</v>

2061
01:28:44.491 --> 01:28:47.160
<v Speaker 4>Things that come out of trees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are all natural,</v>

2062
01:28:47.190 --> 01:28:48.660
<v Speaker 4>so you're going to say stickers or </v>
<v Speaker 4>groups.</v>

2063
01:28:50.290 --> 01:28:54.030
<v Speaker 4>It's groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus made those himself.</v>

2064
01:28:54.031 --> 01:28:54.240
<v Speaker 4>What's</v>

2065
01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.310
<v Speaker 5>up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something on the company that made those</v>

<v Speaker 1>Energy card.</v>

2070
01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Energy card.</v>

2072
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:13.380

<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>

2073

2079
01:29:36.130 --> 01:29:36.963
<v Speaker 1>The energy card has a magnetic strip </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in the back that holds </v>

<v Speaker 1>Our engineers have achieved the correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>ratio response of frequency signatures </v>

2095
01:30:27.511 --> 01:30:28.344
<v Speaker 1>through a technology that matches the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same energy received from the nutrients </v>

2096
01:30:31.441 --> 01:30:32.274
<v Speaker 1>you get from the food you eat and drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know this guys wearing in toe shoes </v>

2097
01:30:35.941 --> 01:30:36.930
<v Speaker 1>when he wrote this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2098
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:41.010
<v Speaker 1>We consume food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It converts into chemical energy,</v>

2099
01:30:41.011 --> 01:30:43.500
<v Speaker 1>which provides a nutritional needs for </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and growth.</v>

2100
01:30:43.770 --> 01:30:44.603
<v Speaker 1>This connection is defined by the laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thermodynamics that requires all </v>

2101
01:30:49.561 --> 01:30:53.340
<v Speaker 1>humans to burn food for energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are fucking cunts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What is the name of this company?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an Alpha biocentric concert.</v>

2104
01:30:59.931 --> 01:31:01.130
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are asking.</v>

2105
01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:06.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A suggested retail price.</v>

2106
01:31:06.421 --> 01:31:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Seventy $9.</v>

2107
01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The card is guaranteed for two years.</v>

2108
01:31:09.871 --> 01:31:12.000
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a credit card fame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just listening.</v>

2109
01:31:12.090 --> 01:31:14.850
<v Speaker 1>It is a credit card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's 100 percent bullshit.</v>

2110
01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:16.973
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck does someone get away with </v>

2111
01:31:18.331 --> 01:31:20.010
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is horrible.</v>

2112
01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I have no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just imagine the idea that you could</v>

2113
01:31:24.121 --> 01:31:26.550
<v Speaker 1>put a card under your food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes your food better.</v>

2114
01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure it because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying it energetically enhances it.</v>

2115
01:31:30.061 --> 01:31:35.061
<v Speaker 1>Does this mean it adds calories to it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>does its nutrient transfer?</v>

2116
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck those dynamics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep using these words.</v>

2117
01:31:40.981 --> 01:31:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they know what they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that like to use</v>

2118
01:31:45.211 --> 01:31:46.590
<v Speaker 1>those sciencey words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2119
01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:50.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like chiropractors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subluxations somebody.</v>

2120
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:52.530
<v Speaker 1>They always say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember them saying that all the time</v>

2121
01:31:52.531 --> 01:31:55.260
<v Speaker 1>to one doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He adjusted me five minutes,</v>

2122
01:31:55.261 --> 01:31:56.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 40 bucks.</v>

2123
01:31:56.581 --> 01:31:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure you drink a lot of water.</v>

2124
01:31:58.051 --> 01:31:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2125
01:31:58.730 --> 01:32:00.190
<v Speaker 1>To wash the fucking taste</v>

2126

<v Speaker 3>out of my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You asshole.</v>

2127
01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:04.210

<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

2133
01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Twitter.</v>

2134
01:32:16.090 --> 01:32:16.923
<v Speaker 2>I'm still getting angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tweets like people that use it or from </v>

2135
01:32:19.781 --> 01:32:22.380
<v Speaker 2>chiropractors themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fewer chiropractice.</v>

2136
01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Some chiropractors and a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who who love Chiropractic and are mad at</v>

2137
01:32:28.781 --> 01:32:29.614
<v Speaker 2>me because I think people think I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling them stupid for using </v>

2138
01:32:31.421 --> 01:32:32.320
<v Speaker 2>chiropractor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

2139
01:32:32.321 --> 01:32:33.890
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got you.</v>

2140
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:34.743
<v Speaker 2>You got a lot of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like I would basically be </v>

2141
01:32:39.671 --> 01:32:43.780
<v Speaker 2>calling half my fan base a stupid if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that were the case and I'm not.</v>

2142
01:32:43.781 --> 01:32:46.240
<v Speaker 2>And I felt kinda bad because a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend of mine,</v>

2143
01:32:46.570 --> 01:32:50.440
<v Speaker 2>like she like after she gave birth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had like a severe enough injury that</v>

2144
01:32:50.441 --> 01:32:55.060
<v Speaker 2>she could barely walk and a chiropractor</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically from massaging the area,</v>

2145
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:58.540
<v Speaker 2>got her up and walking and she's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing she said to me was,</v>

2146
01:32:58.541 --> 01:33:01.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of being called a lemming </v>
<v Speaker 2>moron.</v>

2147
01:33:01.091 --> 01:33:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never use number one.</v>

2148
01:33:02.561 --> 01:33:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I never insulted people who use </v>
<v Speaker 2>chiropractic.</v>

2149
01:33:04.961 --> 01:33:06.010
<v Speaker 2>And number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely didn't.</v>

2150
01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:06.853
<v Speaker 2>You use those two words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think people got the impression </v>

2151
01:33:09.671 --> 01:33:12.670
<v Speaker 2>that I was calling everyone who used </v>
<v Speaker 2>chiropractor's dumb.</v>

2152
01:33:12.671 --> 01:33:15.400
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's never the point of my writing.</v>

2153
01:33:15.401 --> 01:33:18.940
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're not the Moron for </v>
<v Speaker 2>falling for this.</v>

2154
01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:21.040
<v Speaker 2>They're the assholes for selling it.</v>

2155
01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:21.893
<v Speaker 3>Don't even know of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them are assholes because I </v>

2156
01:33:23.871 --> 01:33:26.000
<v Speaker 3>don't know if a lot of them have even </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked into this.</v>

2157
01:33:26.001 --> 01:33:26.834
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to some chiropractors about </v>

2158
01:33:28.281 --> 01:33:29.114
<v Speaker 3>this stuff that's been going on over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last couple of weeks since your article </v>

2159
01:33:31.581 --> 01:33:32.414
<v Speaker 3>and since I did my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since we've talked about it several </v>

2160
01:33:34.671 --> 01:33:35.504
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think they understand the </v>

2161
01:33:37.161 --> 01:33:38.120
<v Speaker 3>origins of this</v>

2162
01:33:38.210 --> 01:33:39.043
<v Speaker 2>or that it's or the stuff they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling isn't considered scientifically </v>

2163
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:42.743
<v Speaker 2>validated</v>

2164
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:45.930
<v Speaker 3>kid and you're getting out of high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school and into college and you know,</v>

2165
01:33:45.931 --> 01:33:46.764
<v Speaker 3>you want to get involved in something </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapeutic in chiropractic medicine </v>

2166
01:33:50.101 --> 01:33:50.934
<v Speaker 3>seems like a good thing and you start </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to chiropractic school like you </v>

2167
01:33:54.151 --> 01:33:56.160
<v Speaker 3>might not even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

2168
01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:59.910
<v Speaker 3>I really do sympathize with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>chiropractors who are out there.</v>

2169
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.040
<v Speaker 3>They have emailed me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

2170
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:04.920
<v Speaker 3>like what you're saying could </v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially destroy my business.</v>

2171
01:34:05.730 --> 01:34:06.563
<v Speaker 3>I understand and I sympathize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to understand that if I </v>

2172
01:34:11.251 --> 01:34:14.190
<v Speaker 3>knew about this and I didn't talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2173
01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:15.293
<v Speaker 3>that would be more horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a responsibility if I find </v>

2174
01:34:19.501 --> 01:34:20.334
<v Speaker 3>something out like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the guy who invented as a fucking </v>

2175
01:34:22.330 --> 01:34:25.170
<v Speaker 3>quack and a magnetic healer and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not really going to medical school.</v>

2176
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:29.190
<v Speaker 3>There's a responsibility that you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to say something about that.</v>

2177
01:34:29.210 --> 01:34:30.043
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just think people are thinking </v>

2178
01:34:31.651 --> 01:34:33.620
<v Speaker 3>about themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're thinking about,</v>

2179
01:34:33.621 --> 01:34:34.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2180
01:34:34.081 --> 01:34:34.914
<v Speaker 3>I've got bills and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got this and I've got to practice </v>

2181
01:34:36.991 --> 01:34:39.060
<v Speaker 3>and I've got this other job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2182
01:34:39.061 --> 01:34:42.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be the guy that tells </v>
<v Speaker 3>you what to do,</v>

2183
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:46.050
<v Speaker 3>but you can't get upset at someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying something.</v>

2184
01:34:46.051 --> 01:34:46.884
<v Speaker 3>That's if I made up the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>chiropractic medicine was founded by a </v>

2185
01:34:49.501 --> 01:34:52.560
<v Speaker 3>magnetic healer and he was killed by his</v>
<v Speaker 3>own son.</v>

2186
01:34:52.770 --> 01:34:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Do you know the story behind that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>run over by his son.</v>

2187
01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 3>His son ran him over</v>

2188
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:01.160
<v Speaker 1>with a fucking car and they think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might've done it on purpose and this son</v>

2189
01:35:01.161 --> 01:35:01.994
<v Speaker 1>apparently was a fucking huge fraud and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the son went on to be the one who </v>

2190
01:35:04.941 --> 01:35:08.930
<v Speaker 1>promoted chiropractic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Medicine was really promoted by the sun.</v>

2191
01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the wikipedia.</v>

2192
01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Pull up the wikipedia on chiropractic </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversies.</v>

2193
01:35:14.850 --> 01:35:17.390
<v Speaker 1>This that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a real,</v>

2194
01:35:17.391 --> 01:35:18.224
<v Speaker 1>a theory that the son murdered the dad </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the son murdered the dad to take </v>

2195
01:35:22.881 --> 01:35:25.310
<v Speaker 1>over the business and then he's the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>who pushed chiropractic.</v>

2196
01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.153
<v Speaker 1>Madison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we had to cut it off at some </v>

2197
01:35:27.351 --> 01:35:29.460
<v Speaker 1>point because the article was 40,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

2198
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

2199
01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.311
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

2200
01:35:31.311 --> 01:35:32.180
<v Speaker 1>What are you out of here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

2201
01:35:33.230 --> 01:35:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is death.</v>

2202
01:35:34.701 --> 01:35:36.760
<v Speaker 1>It says there's a book about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2203
01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Homecoming parade that sets hilarious </v>
<v Speaker 1>injuries by his son.</v>

2204
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:42.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fucking random over his son ran him </v>

2205
01:35:44.031 --> 01:35:47.450
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attempted patricide.</v>

2206
01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:48.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2207
01:35:49.290 --> 01:35:51.230
<v Speaker 1>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fun.</v>

2208
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:54.380
<v Speaker 1>There was speculation that it was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident,</v>

2209
01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.740
<v Speaker 1>but instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2210
01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:02.120
<v Speaker 1>A case of attempted patricide that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that it was not an accident.</v>

2211
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:03.950
<v Speaker 1>No one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who knows?</v>

2212
01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about some shit that went</v>

2213
01:36:05.361 --> 01:36:08.600
<v Speaker 1>down the 18 hundreds or actually 1913 I </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess.</v>

2214
01:36:08.601 --> 01:36:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 1913 Bj Palmer ran over his dad,</v>

2215
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:16.820
<v Speaker 1>dd Palmer and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2216
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:20.510
<v Speaker 1>And that guy is filled with fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems too.</v>

2217
01:36:20.511 --> 01:36:22.490
<v Speaker 1>If you look into him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The son,</v>

2218
01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.340
<v Speaker 1>apparently the sun was a massive fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a sense,</v>

2219
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:26.623
<v Speaker 1>chiropractic medicine was founded by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quack and promoted by a fraud and </v>

2220
01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:31.030
<v Speaker 1>might've murders dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2221
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:36.370
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck does it get so far?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most stunning thing about it.</v>

2222
01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:39.010
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a thing where like it,</v>

2223
01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:41.250
<v Speaker 2>it took root before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2224
01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.250
<v Speaker 2>like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real medicine was,</v>

2225
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:45.760
<v Speaker 2>was starting and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kept going like,</v>

2226
01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:50.450
<v Speaker 2>well medicine was making attempts at </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things and some of them failed and</v>

2227
01:36:50.451 --> 01:36:51.330
<v Speaker 2>some of them stayed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2228
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:54.050
<v Speaker 2>think about around that time was when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bayer was like,</v>

2229
01:36:54.051 --> 01:36:58.010
<v Speaker 2>we have a new miracle cure heroin like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2230
01:36:58.190 --> 01:36:59.330
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2231
01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:01.700
<v Speaker 2>So I mean like they weren't teams and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Coca Cola.</v>

2232
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:04.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they were trying at real things and</v>

2233
01:37:04.011 --> 01:37:05.270
<v Speaker 2>failing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least they were.</v>

2234
01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:07.760
<v Speaker 2>They were trying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like these guys were like,</v>

2235
01:37:07.761 --> 01:37:10.010
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a launch check nudge motherfucker</v>

2236
01:37:10.011 --> 01:37:11.930
<v Speaker 2>out and that didn't work so well</v>

2237
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.823
<v Speaker 1>without the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would not have had this </v>

2238
01:37:14.331 --> 01:37:15.164
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I first started going to </v>

2239
01:37:16.131 --> 01:37:16.964
<v Speaker 1>chiropractors was probably 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one had this information wasn't </v>

2240
01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:22.220
<v Speaker 1>available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knew.</v>

2241
01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:23.600
<v Speaker 1>You just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2242
01:37:23.630 --> 01:37:26.000
<v Speaker 1>he's a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says doctor of Chiropractic.</v>

2243
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.863
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy who studied chiropractic </v>

2244
01:37:27.891 --> 01:37:28.390
<v Speaker 1>medicine</v>

2245
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:29.920
<v Speaker 2>and I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many of them just say,</v>

2246
01:37:29.921 --> 01:37:30.754
<v Speaker 2>doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to dig through their </v>

2247
01:37:31.661 --> 01:37:33.850
<v Speaker 2>website for where it eventually says </v>
<v Speaker 2>chiropractic.</v>

2248
01:37:34.150 --> 01:37:34.983
<v Speaker 1>How can you fucking call yourself a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor if you don't go to medical </v>

2249
01:37:36.821 --> 01:37:37.620
<v Speaker 1>school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't,</v>

2250
01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:39.680
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't there be some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>national standard on it?</v>

2251
01:37:40.170 --> 01:37:42.530
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I and I,</v>

2252
01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I dunno if this should bug me or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>because like you'll see dr somewhere and</v>

2253
01:37:46.021 --> 01:37:46.854
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mds will say md really carefully or </v>

2254
01:37:49.231 --> 01:37:50.064
<v Speaker 2>pediatrician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although will be very careful to say </v>

2255
01:37:51.271 --> 01:37:54.630
<v Speaker 2>what type of doctor they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone like now I'm very leery.</v>

2256
01:37:54.631 --> 01:37:56.490
<v Speaker 2>If I just Dr [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2257
01:37:56.491 --> 01:37:57.324
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they had like what breed of doctor </v>

2258
01:37:59.311 --> 01:38:01.320
<v Speaker 2>are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have a phd?</v>

2259
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Do they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they a chiropractor,</v>

2260
01:38:03.061 --> 01:38:05.370
<v Speaker 2>league of IC doctrine that I see some </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit on their page.</v>

2261
01:38:05.371 --> 01:38:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what type of doctor are they?</v>

2262
01:38:07.610 --> 01:38:10.390
<v Speaker 2>Because like everyone wants you to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2263
01:38:10.410 --> 01:38:12.990
<v Speaker 2>or I think people just want you to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are medical doctor,</v>

2264
01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

2265
01:38:14.150 --> 01:38:14.983
<v Speaker 2>that way that title has a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people will take shit advice if they </v>

2266
01:38:18.121 --> 01:38:20.100
<v Speaker 2>see dr period in front of the name.</v>

2267
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Bill cosby was a doctor for awhile too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took it back.</v>

2268
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:24.990
<v Speaker 2>I apparently people were taking some </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs from him.</v>

2269
01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.770
<v Speaker 2>They just didn't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave him an honorary doctorate.</v>

2270
01:38:28.771 --> 01:38:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Doctorates are also weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2271
01:38:30.211 --> 01:38:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Because if you get a doctorate you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be called a doctor Dr Cosby,</v>

2272
01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:36.330
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to have better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>

2273
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:39.930
<v Speaker 2>We need a new word for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's someone who's got a doctorate.</v>

2274
01:38:39.931 --> 01:38:40.764
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be a fucking doctor and say I </v>
<v Speaker 2>go back and forth on that one because I </v>

2275
01:38:43.261 --> 01:38:44.230
<v Speaker 2>have friends who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2276
01:38:44.250 --> 01:38:45.083
<v Speaker 2>had their phds and like you're kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you call them doctor and then like when </v>

2277
01:38:48.871 --> 01:38:51.720
<v Speaker 2>I think I feel like when they email </v>
<v Speaker 2>people generally in the signature line,</v>

2278
01:38:51.721 --> 01:38:52.554
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2279
01:38:52.650 --> 01:38:56.350
<v Speaker 2>it's Joe Schmo Phd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they make sense.</v>

2280
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:57.383
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they signed things phd in </v>

2281
01:38:58.291 --> 01:39:01.860
<v Speaker 2>general just to not be a dick about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like the,</v>

2282
01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:02.370
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

2283
01:39:02.370 --> 01:39:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I feel like putting Dr Blank when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>a phd.</v>

2284
01:39:05.881 --> 01:39:08.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like I feel like it can cause some </v>
<v Speaker 2>confusion.</v>

2285
01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Dr Laura,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Laura.</v>

2286
01:39:10.701 --> 01:39:14.430
<v Speaker 2>She a doctor was a Dr Phil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Phil's a doctor.</v>

2287
01:39:14.431 --> 01:39:17.610
<v Speaker 2>He's not a psychologist or which one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you is off the top of my head.</v>

2288
01:39:17.611 --> 01:39:18.444
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there was a doctorate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there somewhere or a phd or something </v>

2289
01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:22.353
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many of them that just don't </v>

2290
01:39:22.891 --> 01:39:24.060
<v Speaker 2>have what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because,</v>

2291
01:39:24.061 --> 01:39:24.841
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's his face?</v>

2292
01:39:24.841 --> 01:39:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Dr Oz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really good cardiothoracic surgeon.</v>

2293
01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:29.580
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or on TV though.</v>

2294
01:39:29.581 --> 01:39:30.414
<v Speaker 2>He's so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I sell a miracle cures for weight </v>

2295
01:39:32.341 --> 01:39:33.280
<v Speaker 2>loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gotten.</v>

2296
01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:35.070
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because since Congress told </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2297
01:39:35.071 --> 01:39:36.960
<v Speaker 2>cut the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been in Congress.</v>

2298
01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.863
<v Speaker 2>It's still on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been less full of shit but still a </v>

2299
01:39:41.371 --> 01:39:43.020
<v Speaker 2>little full of shit because that's our </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

2300
01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:46.950
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel a 45 minute TV show with</v>
<v Speaker 2>complete?</v>

2301
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:47.411
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2302
01:39:47.411 --> 01:39:49.440
<v Speaker 2>just peer reviewed science everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

2303
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:50.303
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you start bullshitting and we're way </v>

2304
01:39:52.411 --> 01:39:56.670
<v Speaker 2>more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like shilling for selling miracle</v>

2305
01:39:56.671 --> 01:40:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Cube is so fucked and it's like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointing thing is like he was.</v>

2306
01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:02.033
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I say good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was an amazingly good cardiothoracic </v>

2307
01:40:04.771 --> 01:40:05.604
<v Speaker 2>surgeon and that's what's disappointing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this is he used that credibility </v>

2308
01:40:09.210 --> 01:40:13.050
<v Speaker 2>of being such a good doctor to be such a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big asshole.</v>

2309
01:40:13.110 --> 01:40:14.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

2310
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Why would you do that to people they </v>
<v Speaker 2>expect we,</v>

2311
01:40:17.150 --> 01:40:19.680
<v Speaker 2>we wanted better from you just don't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2312
01:40:19.710 --> 01:40:20.543
<v Speaker 2>Ben Carson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who's like a serious </v>

2313
01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:25.740
<v Speaker 2>neurosurgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was at anything to earth 10,000 years</v>

2314
01:40:25.741 --> 01:40:26.574
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks there's grain in the fucking </v>

2315
01:40:27.541 --> 01:40:29.550
<v Speaker 2>pyramids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grain grain.</v>

2316
01:40:29.610 --> 01:40:30.421
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's great.</v>

2317
01:40:30.421 --> 01:40:31.254
<v Speaker 2>And in the pyramids that's not so </v>
<v Speaker 2>shocking that someone would leave some </v>

2318
01:40:37.291 --> 01:40:42.200
<v Speaker 2>grain behind but not like filled with </v>
<v Speaker 2>grains.</v>

2319
01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:45.270
<v Speaker 2>I think he thought they were silos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were ancient silos.</v>

2320
01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:46.133
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not that he doesn't mean that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like an occasional vase full of </v>

2321
01:40:49.171 --> 01:40:51.450
<v Speaker 2>grain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He means like they were silos and that's</v>

2322
01:40:51.451 --> 01:40:54.830
<v Speaker 2>not not accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were a young earth or it's I.</v>

2323
01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:56.670
<v Speaker 2>That might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2324
01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:59.050
<v Speaker 2>I haven't looked too much into them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might've made that up,</v>

2325
01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:00.873
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing would surprise me with some of </v>

2326
01:41:02.411 --> 01:41:03.244
<v Speaker 2>the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of people who are </v>

2327
01:41:04.151 --> 01:41:04.984
<v Speaker 2>extremely smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they close off just giant sections </v>

2328
01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:08.194
<v Speaker 2>of their reasoning and understand that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to find people that are a </v>

2329
01:41:10.861 --> 01:41:11.900
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2330
01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:14.380
<v Speaker 2>are very skeptical and very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2331
01:41:14.381 --> 01:41:15.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

2332
01:41:15.190 --> 01:41:18.750
<v Speaker 2>or critical thinkers and want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical thinkers in every field.</v>

2333
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:19.541
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2334
01:41:19.541 --> 01:41:20.374
<v Speaker 2>I have this spool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be really good and really critical </v>

2335
01:41:21.911 --> 01:41:24.220
<v Speaker 2>thinking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but motherfucker,</v>

2336
01:41:24.221 --> 01:41:26.320
<v Speaker 2>I have this belief and you can't touch </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2337
01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:28.750
<v Speaker 2>And like that seems to be the case with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people.</v>

2338
01:41:28.751 --> 01:41:30.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want evidence about things.</v>

2339
01:41:30.521 --> 01:41:31.354
<v Speaker 2>Show me evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the big thing is show me where the </v>

2340
01:41:33.131 --> 01:41:33.964
<v Speaker 2>balance of evidence says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you give me two articles that </v>

2341
01:41:36.401 --> 01:41:39.220
<v Speaker 2>say this and then 10,000 that say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2342
01:41:39.221 --> 01:41:40.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going there.</v>

2343
01:41:40.691 --> 01:41:42.770
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's kind of a,</v>

2344
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:45.490
<v Speaker 2>a solid way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to evaluate evidence.</v>

2345
01:41:45.491 --> 01:41:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Like if you've got a lot of them that </v>
<v Speaker 2>say this and they're.</v>

2346
01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:49.853
<v Speaker 2>And they seem solid and backed by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>backed by people who know what they're </v>

2347
01:41:53.111 --> 01:41:54.890
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems to be the,</v>

2348
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.770
<v Speaker 2>a good way to evaluate what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2349
01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:00.730
<v Speaker 2>how you're gonna choose your opinions on</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2350
01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:02.073
<v Speaker 2>It seems like you just really have to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of research before you form any </v>

2351
01:42:04.571 --> 01:42:05.530
<v Speaker 2>opinion on anything.</v>

2352
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:06.383
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's one of the reasons why I </v>

2353
01:42:07.301 --> 01:42:11.760
<v Speaker 2>don't blame people when they don't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>it right right away because I do like.</v>

2354
01:42:11.770 --> 01:42:13.700
<v Speaker 2>And this is something I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of my talks a lot,</v>

2355
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:14.381
<v Speaker 2>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2356
01:42:14.381 --> 01:42:18.320
<v Speaker 2>take out your phones and Google a term </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're not sure about in,</v>

2357
01:42:18.321 --> 01:42:19.570
<v Speaker 2>in health or nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>google,</v>

2358
01:42:19.571 --> 01:42:20.420
<v Speaker 2>gmos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>google,</v>

2359
01:42:20.421 --> 01:42:21.430
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google,</v>

2360
01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:22.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2361
01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:23.313
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me what the top 10 search results </v>

2362
01:42:24.911 --> 01:42:26.500
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2363
01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:29.830
<v Speaker 2>sometimes like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with Gmos for a long time,</v>

2364
01:42:29.831 --> 01:42:31.960
<v Speaker 2>the top like eight out of 10 search </v>
<v Speaker 2>results were like,</v>

2365
01:42:31.961 --> 01:42:32.794
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to make your Dick fall </v>

2366
01:42:33.761 --> 01:42:34.594
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like now like it's changed a </v>

2367
01:42:36.161 --> 01:42:36.994
<v Speaker 2>little bit because there's been a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>effort by science writers to get other </v>

2368
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:41.770
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't gonna kill you,</v>

2369
01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:43.600
<v Speaker 2>but like for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for awhile,</v>

2370
01:42:43.690 --> 01:42:44.700
<v Speaker 2>like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2371
01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:48.070
<v Speaker 2>it's so many of the top search results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were horrible.</v>

2372
01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:49.900
<v Speaker 2>How hard should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2373
01:42:49.901 --> 01:42:50.734
<v Speaker 2>just a soccer mom in Iowa have to hunt </v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out if this is going to kill </v>

2374
01:42:53.441 --> 01:42:54.420
<v Speaker 2>her kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like and I,</v>

2375
01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:55.413
<v Speaker 2>that's why I really don't blame people </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they get it wrong at first because </v>

2376
01:42:58.031 --> 01:42:58.864
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much bad information out </v>

2377
01:43:00.431 --> 01:43:02.620
<v Speaker 2>there that it's easy to get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>impression that,</v>

2378
01:43:02.621 --> 01:43:03.454
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 10,000 articles say it's bad when </v>

2379
01:43:05.381 --> 01:43:06.790
<v Speaker 2>it's really just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2380
01:43:06.850 --> 01:43:09.670
<v Speaker 2>screaming assholes repeating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2381
01:43:09.671 --> 01:43:11.380
<v Speaker 2>the one article that say it's bad.</v>

2382
01:43:11.630 --> 01:43:14.180
<v Speaker 3>Well if you just google chiropractic </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine,</v>

2383
01:43:14.181 --> 01:43:16.280
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna get a lot of fraud </v>
<v Speaker 3>articles.</v>

2384
01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:17.473
<v Speaker 3>If you Google Chiropractic is bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get your article and then you go </v>

2385
01:43:20.271 --> 01:43:23.870
<v Speaker 3>down a rabbit hole and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you Google chiropractic fraud,</v>

2386
01:43:23.871 --> 01:43:24.704
<v Speaker 3>you'll find plenty of stuff on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the history of chiropractic </v>

2387
01:43:27.891 --> 01:43:30.610
<v Speaker 3>medicine is where really unravels and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2388
01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:31.453
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when someone just wants to </v>

2389
01:43:33.351 --> 01:43:36.190
<v Speaker 3>know what's going to fix my back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's not where they started.</v>

2390
01:43:36.191 --> 01:43:37.750
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well and that's a problem,</v>

2391
01:43:37.751 --> 01:43:38.584
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to back problems are fucking </v>

2392
01:43:40.190 --> 01:43:41.023
<v Speaker 3>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is a part of the problem is </v>

2393
01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:46.220
<v Speaker 3>people get desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do not know what to do.</v>

2394
01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:47.323
<v Speaker 3>Just like when you were saying you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting those horrible headaches and </v>

2395
01:43:48.711 --> 01:43:49.970
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking try anything.</v>

2396
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:52.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go GMO</v>

2397
01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:54.980
<v Speaker 4>free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to drink water only.</v>

2398
01:43:54.981 --> 01:43:56.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2399
01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.360
<v Speaker 4>I gave up my beloved Diet Coke Dark </v>
<v Speaker 4>Times.</v>

2400
01:43:59.361 --> 01:44:00.194
<v Speaker 4>You get worried,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get worried and you start thinking </v>

2401
01:44:02.391 --> 01:44:03.224
<v Speaker 4>about different ways that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if someone comes along and </v>

2402
01:44:04.971 --> 01:44:05.661
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2403
01:44:05.661 --> 01:44:07.430
<v Speaker 4>this is the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just stick with it.</v>

2404
01:44:07.431 --> 01:44:10.430
<v Speaker 4>I need to see you twice a week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one guy that I was going to,</v>

2405
01:44:10.431 --> 01:44:11.570
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to come more often,</v>

2406
01:44:11.571 --> 01:44:13.420
<v Speaker 4>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really the way I go.</v>

2407
01:44:13.421 --> 01:44:16.230
<v Speaker 4>I've got to get you to move my neck more</v>
<v Speaker 4>often.</v>

2408
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:19.160
<v Speaker 4>The fuck are you doing really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2409
01:44:19.161 --> 01:44:22.310
<v Speaker 4>And I stopped going to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going to this one guy and he had a</v>

2410
01:44:22.311 --> 01:44:25.100
<v Speaker 4>really good massage therapist and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting a massage therapy.</v>

2411
01:44:25.101 --> 01:44:28.280
<v Speaker 4>Then I stopped getting the chiropractic </v>
<v Speaker 4>adjustment and then he was like,</v>

2412
01:44:28.281 --> 01:44:30.080
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta you gotta get the chiropractic</v>

2413
01:44:30.081 --> 01:44:31.050
<v Speaker 4>adjustment too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

2414
01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:32.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm kidding.</v>

2415
01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.820
<v Speaker 4>One thing is helping me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other thing,</v>

2416
01:44:34.821 --> 01:44:36.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just.</v>

2417
01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:39.290
<v Speaker 4>It sounds cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the sound was like pop,</v>

2418
01:44:39.291 --> 01:44:41.630
<v Speaker 4>pop that crick feels cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels good.</v>

2419
01:44:41.631 --> 01:44:44.000
<v Speaker 4>Like when you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that feels good,</v>

2420
01:44:44.150 --> 01:44:47.030
<v Speaker 4>but that's the same fucking thing that a</v>
<v Speaker 4>chiropractor is doing to you.</v>

2421
01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:49.880
<v Speaker 4>But then they tell you not supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do that to your fingers.</v>

2422
01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:50.901
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2423
01:44:50.901 --> 01:44:51.501
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2424
01:44:51.501 --> 01:44:52.580
<v Speaker 4>it can cause arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2425
01:44:52.581 --> 01:44:55.940
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck do you know how many I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been doing it my whole life.</v>

2426
01:44:55.941 --> 01:44:57.610
<v Speaker 4>I don't have arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2427
01:44:57.710 --> 01:44:58.543
<v Speaker 4>the question is kind of like we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about with longterm pesticide </v>

2428
01:45:00.441 --> 01:45:01.274
<v Speaker 4>exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where that's gonna land me </v>

2429
01:45:02.871 --> 01:45:04.570
<v Speaker 4>when I'm 70.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe it.</v>

2430
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:05.703
<v Speaker 4>That causes arthritis 70.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just going to throw some new </v>

2431
01:45:07.941 --> 01:45:08.774
<v Speaker 4>touareg at me and it will be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Point was that you can't have it both </v>

2432
01:45:11.511 --> 01:45:11.930
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>

2433
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:14.900
<v Speaker 4>If this causes arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck are you allowed to crack my</v>

2434
01:45:14.901 --> 01:45:17.360
<v Speaker 4>neck all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an excellent points.</v>

2435
01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:17.691
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2436
01:45:17.691 --> 01:45:19.190
<v Speaker 4>it's one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny.</v>

2437
01:45:19.191 --> 01:45:20.220
<v Speaker 4>I've had um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one person.</v>

2438
01:45:20.221 --> 01:45:21.054
<v Speaker 4>It's funny for all the people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>messaged me because you asked what the </v>

2439
01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:24.170
<v Speaker 4>feedback was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't just,</v>

2440
01:45:24.171 --> 01:45:25.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chiropractors who would really mad.</v>

2441
01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:30.470
<v Speaker 4>I had some people say my parents brought</v>
<v Speaker 4>me for Chiropractic when I was a kid and</v>

2442
01:45:30.471 --> 01:45:32.630
<v Speaker 4>now my back is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

2443
01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:36.710
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know how many stories there </v>
<v Speaker 4>are like that from people saying,</v>

2444
01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:37.753
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we started chiropractic when I was a </v>

2445
01:45:38.511 --> 01:45:41.480
<v Speaker 4>baby and this was not the way to go for </v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

2446
01:45:41.970 --> 01:45:42.803
<v Speaker 4>but God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the responses to the article be </v>

2447
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:45.730
<v Speaker 4>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2448
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:46.663
<v Speaker 4>what does that woman who just died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the playboy model or assuming the </v>

2449
01:45:49.941 --> 01:45:52.850
<v Speaker 4>chiropractor there are like the sudden </v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

2450
01:45:52.851 --> 01:45:54.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of violent,</v>

2451
01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:58.370
<v Speaker 4>a way that they crack a neck and </v>
<v Speaker 4>chiropractic can leave you open to,</v>

2452
01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:00.980
<v Speaker 4>to severing an artery in your neck.</v>

2453
01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:01.813
<v Speaker 4>Now it's not often that it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it happens and this is one of those </v>

2454
01:46:05.061 --> 01:46:05.894
<v Speaker 4>things that I have a really big </v>
<v Speaker 4>contention with chiropractic with is </v>

2455
01:46:08.091 --> 01:46:08.924
<v Speaker 4>that they have all these mornings about </v>
<v Speaker 4>how western medicine and it's kind of </v>

2456
01:46:12.081 --> 01:46:12.914
<v Speaker 4>funny that they call it Western medicine</v>
<v Speaker 4>when chiropractic started in the middle </v>

2457
01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:16.590
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the US.</v>

2458
01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:17.653
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you don't get to claim that </v>

2459
01:46:18.321 --> 01:46:20.960
<v Speaker 4>you made this in China for fuck sakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like they'll,</v>

2460
01:46:20.961 --> 01:46:21.794
<v Speaker 4>they'll say that western medicine is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible for you and it has all these </v>

2461
01:46:23.841 --> 01:46:26.570
<v Speaker 4>potential side effects and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has potential side effects,</v>

2462
01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:30.080
<v Speaker 4>but they have potential side effects </v>
<v Speaker 4>while they actually cure shit.</v>

2463
01:46:30.081 --> 01:46:33.050
<v Speaker 4>You have potential side effects while </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're cracking someone's neck.</v>

2464
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:34.183
<v Speaker 4>Like the potential side effects too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about 320 million people </v>

2465
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:40.183
<v Speaker 4>that are going to the doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have 100,000 cases of potential </v>

2466
01:46:43.131 --> 01:46:45.650
<v Speaker 4>side effects across the board from all </v>
<v Speaker 4>causes,</v>

2467
01:46:46.010 --> 01:46:46.843
<v Speaker 4>that's what they're harping on her </v>
<v Speaker 4>harping on the minority of things that </v>

2468
01:46:49.861 --> 01:46:50.190
<v Speaker 4>happen</v>

2469
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:51.480
<v Speaker 3>and go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2470
01:46:51.530 --> 01:46:52.363
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously there's some shit like </v>

2471
01:46:53.491 --> 01:46:56.630
<v Speaker 3>thalidomide and some stuff that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't use anymore that are horrible.</v>

2472
01:46:56.631 --> 01:46:57.464
<v Speaker 3>And the side effects,</v>

2473
01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:59.360
<v Speaker 2>what am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never made it to the US.</v>

2474
01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:02.180
<v Speaker 2>That's something a lot of people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize really.</v>

2475
01:47:02.181 --> 01:47:03.920
<v Speaker 2>It was used in other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other countries.</v>

2476
01:47:03.921 --> 01:47:04.754
<v Speaker 2>Now we had one regulator in the US who </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw the drug was coming up for approval </v>

2477
01:47:07.911 --> 01:47:09.410
<v Speaker 2>here and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2478
01:47:09.411 --> 01:47:12.800
<v Speaker 2>we have to look into this more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they saw the cases in Europe,</v>

2479
01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:13.913
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all these infants that were being </v>

2480
01:47:15.230 --> 01:47:18.170
<v Speaker 2>born with major side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>

2481
01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:19.011
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>told Ya.</v>

2482
01:47:19.011 --> 01:47:20.750
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was how they started.</v>

2483
01:47:20.751 --> 01:47:23.600
<v Speaker 2>And this was what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually what gave us a,</v>

2484
01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:24.960
<v Speaker 2>one of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2485
01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:28.530
<v Speaker 2>acts for regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for safety and efficacy in the u.</v>

2486
01:47:28.531 --> 01:47:29.364
<v Speaker 2>s and basically it said that drugs </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they make it to market now have </v>

2487
01:47:31.611 --> 01:47:32.444
<v Speaker 2>to be proven beyond a certain amount to </v>
<v Speaker 2>show that they are both safe and </v>

2488
01:47:36.861 --> 01:47:37.694
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was basically thalidomide that </v>

2489
01:47:39.530 --> 01:47:41.130
<v Speaker 2>launched that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2490
01:47:41.150 --> 01:47:42.560
<v Speaker 2>that act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2491
01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:45.380
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of like we're good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning from our mistakes.</v>

2492
01:47:45.650 --> 01:47:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2493
01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.600
<v Speaker 2>in far I say we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2494
01:47:47.601 --> 01:47:48.440
<v Speaker 2>I work for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

2495
01:47:48.441 --> 01:47:49.160
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2496
01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:51.620
<v Speaker 2>we're good at learning from our mistakes</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we have a fuck up like that.</v>

2497
01:47:51.621 --> 01:47:54.590
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what and what worries me is</v>

2498
01:47:54.591 --> 01:47:55.424
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to have eventually </v>
<v Speaker 2>another way we can very easily have </v>

2499
01:47:58.941 --> 01:48:02.180
<v Speaker 2>another drug like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it will be something that we haven't</v>

2500
01:48:02.181 --> 01:48:05.720
<v Speaker 2>regulated out of the system yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what the next thing will</v>

2501
01:48:05.721 --> 01:48:06.554
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it'll be something that we haven't </v>

2502
01:48:07.971 --> 01:48:10.670
<v Speaker 2>seen yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the,</v>

2503
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:13.430
<v Speaker 2>that that's the kind of a scary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be,</v>

2504
01:48:13.431 --> 01:48:16.490
<v Speaker 2>it'll be like we already know to test </v>
<v Speaker 2>for things in utero.</v>

2505
01:48:16.491 --> 01:48:18.750
<v Speaker 2>We already noticed the tests for things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>

2506
01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:20.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can cause cancer.</v>

2507
01:48:20.001 --> 01:48:23.060
<v Speaker 2>We already know certain types of testing</v>
<v Speaker 2>a like,</v>

2508
01:48:23.110 --> 01:48:26.690
<v Speaker 2>but the little mermaid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so crazy nontoxic.</v>

2509
01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:29.840
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't get it to kill a rat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How nutty is that?</v>

2510
01:48:29.930 --> 01:48:31.600
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did the babies?</v>

2511
01:48:31.650 --> 01:48:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2512
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:33.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy that something that was,</v>

2513
01:48:33.921 --> 01:48:36.800
<v Speaker 2>that was the purpose of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2514
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:37.663
<v Speaker 2>it was used for a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and the thing that they gave it </v>

2515
01:48:39.771 --> 01:48:40.604
<v Speaker 2>to mothers for was to stop a morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>sickness that would still used in a few </v>

2516
01:48:44.931 --> 01:48:45.764
<v Speaker 2>treatments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just don't get it anywhere near a </v>

2517
01:48:47.721 --> 01:48:48.940
<v Speaker 2>pregnant woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

2518
01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:50.450
<v Speaker 2>they gave it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really,</v>

2519
01:48:50.451 --> 01:48:51.284
<v Speaker 2>really good for learning or phrase it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really effective at stopping </v>

2520
01:48:55.551 --> 01:48:56.384
<v Speaker 2>morning sickness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just nobody had a clue that it was </v>

2521
01:48:58.790 --> 01:49:00.380
<v Speaker 2>what it was causing to,</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2523
01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:03.253
<v Speaker 2>and it was causing limbs to not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>formed and it was causing all these </v>

2524
01:49:06.291 --> 01:49:07.124
<v Speaker 2>crazy things and tens of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>babies were born deformed before they </v>

2525
01:49:10.041 --> 01:49:10.701
<v Speaker 2>went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yikes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Pull the plug.</v>

2527
01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:14.640

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2537
01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:31.900
<v Speaker 2>with your neurotrauma nootropics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nootropics.</v>

2538
01:49:31.901 --> 01:49:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

2539
01:49:32.290 --> 01:49:33.650
<v Speaker 2>my apologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a,</v>

2540
01:49:33.651 --> 01:49:34.484
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so with a w so you know about a phase </v>

2541
01:49:36.941 --> 01:49:39.250
<v Speaker 2>three clinical trials and all that from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from that,</v>

2542
01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:41.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you get to phase three,</v>

2543
01:49:41.381 --> 01:49:42.214
<v Speaker 2>generally you're testing between three </v>
<v Speaker 2>and 10,000 people in the population and </v>

2544
01:49:45.221 --> 01:49:46.630
<v Speaker 2>you've gotten through a few trials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2545
01:49:46.631 --> 01:49:47.464
<v Speaker 2>that this effective for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to see if people have you're </v>

2546
01:49:49.751 --> 01:49:53.470
<v Speaker 2>testing for allergic reactions in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>testing to see where people are going to</v>

2547
01:49:53.471 --> 01:49:56.470
<v Speaker 2>have issues with the drug so that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to market,</v>

2548
01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:58.390
<v Speaker 2>you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2549
01:49:58.391 --> 01:49:59.224
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is the percentage of people </v>

2550
01:50:00.281 --> 01:50:02.680
<v Speaker 2>that have these side effects as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage with these.</v>

2551
01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:04.930
<v Speaker 2>If you have these side effects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call your doctor right away.</v>

2552
01:50:04.930 --> 01:50:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Just continued that type of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's three to 10,000 people.</v>

2553
01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:10.030
<v Speaker 2>You don't know who you're going to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to.</v>

2554
01:50:10.031 --> 01:50:10.864
<v Speaker 2>That's on x medication that has x </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder on top of the thing you're </v>

2555
01:50:14.471 --> 01:50:16.430
<v Speaker 2>treating for that type of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2556
01:50:16.450 --> 01:50:19.630
<v Speaker 2>or if it could cause someone to die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things can happen.</v>

2557
01:50:19.631 --> 01:50:20.464
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of what happened with Vioxx </v>

2558
01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:23.200
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2559
01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:24.310
<v Speaker 2>they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2560
01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:25.233
<v Speaker 2>there were some people in that room who </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably strokes and some folks it was </v>

2561
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:34.670
<v Speaker 2>arthritis medication and it was like he </v>
<v Speaker 2>got a stroke from that part.</v>

2562
01:50:34.690 --> 01:50:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2563
01:50:36.111 --> 01:50:36.810
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>

2564
01:50:36.810 --> 01:50:40.120
<v Speaker 2>there were people in that room who </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably look at it and said,</v>

2565
01:50:40.121 --> 01:50:41.860
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's this risk factor,</v>

2566
01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:42.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2567
01:50:42.670 --> 01:50:46.030
<v Speaker 2>that causes you to increase your </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible risk factor by x percent.</v>

2568
01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:49.120
<v Speaker 2>What if somebody has all of these risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>factors combined?</v>

2569
01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2570
01:50:50.321 --> 01:50:51.154
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you shouldn't approve it because </v>

2571
01:50:51.971 --> 01:50:52.804
<v Speaker 2>there's a chance if you put it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody on this who has all of these </v>

2572
01:50:54.851 --> 01:50:55.930
<v Speaker 2>combined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2573
01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:56.813
<v Speaker 2>there's a chance that they're gonna have</v>
<v Speaker 2>their chances of getting a stroke is or </v>

2574
01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:00.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having an issue with their heart.</v>

2575
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.880
<v Speaker 2>What is it harder tech firm it is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be through the roof.</v>

2576
01:51:03.881 --> 01:51:06.310
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't approve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it got approved anyway.</v>

2577
01:51:06.311 --> 01:51:09.920
<v Speaker 2>And it's one of those drugs that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have been put through a lot of</v>

2578
01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:12.730
<v Speaker 2>was heart attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stroke from it.</v>

2579
01:51:12.770 --> 01:51:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a blood clot.</v>

2580
01:51:14.110 --> 01:51:15.700
<v Speaker 2>That must have been blood clots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2581
01:51:15.701 --> 01:51:18.290
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's just been significant </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues with some folks.</v>

2582
01:51:18.291 --> 01:51:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like there is a chance when you</v>

2583
01:51:20.501 --> 01:51:23.800
<v Speaker 2>put any drug through now they try to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>through things to minimize this,</v>

2584
01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:28.300
<v Speaker 2>but because a phase three trial only </v>
<v Speaker 2>test in,</v>

2585
01:51:28.301 --> 01:51:29.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of the population,</v>

2586
01:51:29.771 --> 01:51:32.260
<v Speaker 2>they try to get a diverse group when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it out,</v>

2587
01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:36.070
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what the possible effects</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to be on someone else.</v>

2588
01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:36.903
<v Speaker 2>So you might see new side effects </v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on the other drugs someone is </v>

2589
01:51:40.230 --> 01:51:41.063
<v Speaker 2>onto because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not prescribing these to healthy </v>

2590
01:51:42.311 --> 01:51:43.144
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're prescribing this to a sick </v>

2591
01:51:44.261 --> 01:51:45.100
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2592
01:51:45.101 --> 01:51:46.480
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that definitely can happen.</v>

2593
01:51:46.481 --> 01:51:49.000
<v Speaker 2>So that's my first certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time after drugs on the market.</v>

2594
01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:53.530
<v Speaker 2>They do post a lot is kind of phase four</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical trials.</v>

2595
01:51:53.531 --> 01:51:54.364
<v Speaker 2>You're doing a postmarket monitoring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that does go on for a certain amount </v>

2596
01:51:57.581 --> 01:52:01.540
<v Speaker 2>of time and sometimes drugs are pulled </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the amount of side effects.</v>

2597
01:52:01.541 --> 01:52:03.340
<v Speaker 2>The other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't happen often,</v>

2598
01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:07.000
<v Speaker 2>but it can happen based upon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2599
01:52:07.001 --> 01:52:10.000
<v Speaker 2>the amount of issues that you see after </v>
<v Speaker 2>it hits market.</v>

2600
01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:14.350
<v Speaker 2>What are your thoughts about advertising</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs on television?</v>

2601
01:52:14.351 --> 01:52:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Like a ask your doctor about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your doctor.</v>

2602
01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:19.390
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

2603
01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:20.223
<v Speaker 2>I would say mixed feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of my feelings are that it's a </v>

2604
01:52:22.331 --> 01:52:23.260
<v Speaker 2>bad thing.</v>

2605
01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:24.113
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's the only good thing I see from </v>

2606
01:52:26.081 --> 01:52:28.150
<v Speaker 2>it and I mean most of my feelings about </v>
<v Speaker 2>are still,</v>

2607
01:52:28.151 --> 01:52:28.984
<v Speaker 2>if it's a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only good thing I see about it is </v>

2608
01:52:31.301 --> 01:52:33.060
<v Speaker 2>that if you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2609
01:52:33.390 --> 01:52:36.610
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a patient that's got a shitty disease to</v>

2610
01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:37.633
<v Speaker 2>work with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get aware that there's a new </v>

2611
01:52:39.611 --> 01:52:41.080
<v Speaker 2>medication to treat it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2612
01:52:41.081 --> 01:52:42.780
<v Speaker 2>where they should be getting that </v>
<v Speaker 2>information there.</v>

2613
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ask your doctor,</v>

2614
01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:47.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe maybe you know what your doctor </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2615
01:52:47.421 --> 01:52:49.410
<v Speaker 2>if you're asking them a drug dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2616
01:52:49.411 --> 01:52:53.150
<v Speaker 2>the problem is when they show these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people holding hands and spinning around</v>

2617
01:52:53.151 --> 01:52:53.984
<v Speaker 2>in a field of wheat and having the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest time in their life and </v>

2618
01:52:55.701 --> 01:52:59.000
<v Speaker 2>butterflies are flying around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>puppies are magnetically drawn to them.</v>

2619
01:52:59.310 --> 01:53:00.143
<v Speaker 2>Enough drugs for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the problem is like they have </v>

2620
01:53:02.901 --> 01:53:05.480
<v Speaker 2>beautiful music playing there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulating you.</v>

2621
01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:06.761
<v Speaker 2>Like and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2622
01:53:06.761 --> 01:53:08.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like that's like,</v>

2623
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:09.770
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not appropriate.</v>

2624
01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.820
<v Speaker 2>I lived in England for a year and when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was over there I realized I'm like,</v>

2625
01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where were all the drug advertisements?</v>

2626
01:53:17.661 --> 01:53:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Like this is not a thing out here.</v>

2627
01:53:22.350 --> 01:53:24.020
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's free,</v>

2628
01:53:24.021 --> 01:53:25.000
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2629
01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:25.853
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some things that were kind of </v>

2630
01:53:26.721 --> 01:53:27.560
<v Speaker 2>crazy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

2631
01:53:27.561 --> 01:53:31.010
<v Speaker 2>I landed in the hospital overnight once </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was there and I was so like,</v>

2632
01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:33.160
<v Speaker 2>I know you already knew that I had no </v>
<v Speaker 2>copays.</v>

2633
01:53:33.170 --> 01:53:34.940
<v Speaker 2>When I went to a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2634
01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:36.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the hospital overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck fuck,</v>

2635
01:53:36.801 --> 01:53:37.161
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

2636
01:53:37.161 --> 01:53:38.260
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm to like,</v>

2637
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:42.800
<v Speaker 2>this is going to cost me 10 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I left they were like,</v>

2638
01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:44.210
<v Speaker 2>did you take a cab here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2639
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:44.751
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

2640
01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:45.231
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2641
01:53:45.231 --> 01:53:46.640
<v Speaker 2>if you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were going to pay for it.</v>

2642
01:53:46.641 --> 01:53:48.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2643
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:52.460
<v Speaker 2>who are you people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why I'm an American.</v>

2644
01:53:52.461 --> 01:53:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do with myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to give us the treatment,</v>

2645
01:53:55.970 --> 01:53:59.170
<v Speaker 2>the treatment rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it the same over there?</v>

2646
01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:00.053
<v Speaker 2>Because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have friends in Canada and they have </v>

2647
01:54:02.331 --> 01:54:05.480
<v Speaker 2>massive complaints about the medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>system in terms of like,</v>

2648
01:54:05.481 --> 01:54:07.730
<v Speaker 2>if you get injured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a long time.</v>

2649
01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:08.953
<v Speaker 2>All my relatives are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have like five relatives in this </v>

2650
01:54:10.581 --> 01:54:11.414
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rest all live in Nova Scotia and </v>

2651
01:54:12.650 --> 01:54:14.990
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say it's a mixed bag.</v>

2652
01:54:14.991 --> 01:54:18.920
<v Speaker 2>So if you need urgent care or regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>care,</v>

2653
01:54:18.921 --> 01:54:20.540
<v Speaker 2>like you need to go to the doctor for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>checkup,</v>

2654
01:54:20.541 --> 01:54:21.560
<v Speaker 2>you need your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2655
01:54:21.561 --> 01:54:23.110
<v Speaker 2>the annuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2656
01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:25.520
<v Speaker 2>or you have a fucking heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2657
01:54:25.521 --> 01:54:28.010
<v Speaker 2>I would say you're better off living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>

2658
01:54:28.011 --> 01:54:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a little cousin that was born with</v>

2659
01:54:29.841 --> 01:54:33.650
<v Speaker 2>basically no chambers in her heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is horrifying.</v>

2660
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2661
01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:36.550
<v Speaker 2>it's like they saw it in Utero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2662
01:54:36.551 --> 01:54:37.384
<v Speaker 2>and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2663
01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:38.653
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have to give this child </v>
<v Speaker 2>and operation like almost immediately </v>

2664
01:54:40.881 --> 01:54:44.930
<v Speaker 2>when she was born for the next two years</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of surgery,</v>

2665
01:54:44.931 --> 01:54:45.764
<v Speaker 2>almost every like open heart surgery </v>
<v Speaker 2>every year on the dot of a year as the </v>

2666
01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:51.380
<v Speaker 2>heart grows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like we asked,</v>

2667
01:54:51.381 --> 01:54:52.214
<v Speaker 2>you know why?</v>

2668
01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:53.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2669
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:53.923
<v Speaker 2>I mean they couldn't do all the fixing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they needed to do it as a heart </v>

2670
01:54:56.121 --> 01:54:57.980
<v Speaker 2>got bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do they do?</v>

2671
01:54:57.981 --> 01:54:59.780
<v Speaker 2>How do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

2672
01:54:59.781 --> 01:55:01.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I knew all the technicalities,</v>

2673
01:55:01.851 --> 01:55:04.040
<v Speaker 2>but you'd have to talk to a heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgeon chamber.</v>

2674
01:55:04.041 --> 01:55:06.920
<v Speaker 2>So would the heart look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure.</v>

2675
01:55:06.921 --> 01:55:09.190
<v Speaker 2>I never saw the pictures of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's a,</v>

2676
01:55:09.230 --> 01:55:10.460
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll hunt down my,</v>

2677
01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:11.271
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her father,</v>

2678
01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:14.060
<v Speaker 2>my cousins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a blog that documented it if you want to</v>

2679
01:55:14.061 --> 01:55:14.894
<v Speaker 2>have a peak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was a fairly rare condition of </v>

2680
01:55:16.970 --> 01:55:18.830
<v Speaker 2>the heart was I believe when she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>born,</v>

2681
01:55:18.831 --> 01:55:20.960
<v Speaker 2>like I was a little closer to the center</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the chest.</v>

2682
01:55:20.961 --> 01:55:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a very,</v>

2683
01:55:22.581 --> 01:55:25.550
<v Speaker 2>like my mom said that when she held her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she was first born,</v>

2684
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:26.623
<v Speaker 2>like the pulsing even felt sounded a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little different than a normal infant's </v>

2685
01:55:30.981 --> 01:55:33.620
<v Speaker 2>heart like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean the first,</v>

2686
01:55:33.710 --> 01:55:36.650
<v Speaker 2>at first they did a surgery that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a band around the heart,</v>

2687
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:37.843
<v Speaker 2>a to give it a little more structure and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they formed more chambers and then </v>

2688
01:55:40.791 --> 01:55:43.500
<v Speaker 2>when she was three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put in like full chambers.</v>

2689
01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Now she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing she can't do is she can't</v>

2690
01:55:46.261 --> 01:55:49.170
<v Speaker 2>play contact sports and they paid </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

2691
01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:54.570
<v Speaker 2>She can't play contact sports because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of causing,</v>

2692
01:55:54.690 --> 01:55:56.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure exactly what it can do,</v>

2693
01:55:56.731 --> 01:55:57.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2694
01:55:57.310 --> 01:55:58.143
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can cause a little bit too much </v>

2695
01:55:58.651 --> 01:56:01.770
<v Speaker 2>trauma to a heart that's already been </v>
<v Speaker 2>through a lot of trauma.</v>

2696
01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:03.930
<v Speaker 2>But that's the only thing that she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been told not to do.</v>

2697
01:56:04.010 --> 01:56:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Don't kick box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2698
01:56:05.071 --> 01:56:07.060
<v Speaker 2>No kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no good.</v>

2699
01:56:07.190 --> 01:56:08.340
<v Speaker 2>No good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She can run,</v>

2700
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:10.080
<v Speaker 2>she can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe she can run,</v>

2701
01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:12.780
<v Speaker 2>she can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's happy.</v>

2702
01:56:12.781 --> 01:56:15.120
<v Speaker 2>Active little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks really healthy.</v>

2703
01:56:15.121 --> 01:56:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is about the same.</v>

2704
01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:17.011
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

2705
01:56:17.011 --> 01:56:17.844
<v Speaker 2>she's a twin and she's got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's about the same height as her </v>

2706
01:56:19.831 --> 01:56:21.290
<v Speaker 2>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she's a,</v>

2707
01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:23.153
<v Speaker 3>why didn't they just take her to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>chiropractor where they could adjust to </v>

2708
01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:27.690
<v Speaker 3>see if you'd been there to suggest this </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

2709
01:56:27.691 --> 01:56:29.460
<v Speaker 3>She'd be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rub the back of your.</v>

2710
01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:32.970
<v Speaker 3>I went from maybe she never known what a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pal throw stickers.</v>

2711
01:56:33.490 --> 01:56:36.130
<v Speaker 3>One of them things that credit card,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just put it under a feet once you sleep,</v>

2712
01:56:36.131 --> 01:56:36.964
<v Speaker 3>but some energy for her food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to this one motherfucker who is </v>

2713
01:56:40.441 --> 01:56:44.700
<v Speaker 3>treating a bunch of fighters and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>a zone healer.</v>

2714
01:56:44.701 --> 01:56:46.650
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what a zone healers heard of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

2715
01:56:46.651 --> 01:56:49.440
<v Speaker 3>But I'm excited now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seem like such a nice guy.</v>

2716
01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:51.010
<v Speaker 3>He was a chiropractor too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he seemed like,</v>

2717
01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:55.560
<v Speaker 3>and it probably is a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he would press the back of your head</v>

2718
01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:58.770
<v Speaker 3>or like little spots and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does this hurt here?</v>

2719
01:56:58.771 --> 01:57:00.450
<v Speaker 3>Does this hurt here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does this hurt here?</v>

2720
01:57:00.451 --> 01:57:01.620
<v Speaker 3>And then you press harder.</v>

2721
01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:04.460
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that one's Kinda S.</v>

2722
01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:06.733
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there could be an issue with the </v>

2723
01:57:08.250 --> 01:57:10.320
<v Speaker 3>hypothalamus or some shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2724
01:57:10.321 --> 01:57:12.270
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>

2725
01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:15.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm a pretty skeptical per.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been hoodwinked before,</v>

2726
01:57:15.301 --> 01:57:16.134
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pretty skeptical and when I know</v>
<v Speaker 3>that someone's pushing on a part of my </v>

2727
01:57:20.161 --> 01:57:22.710
<v Speaker 3>head harder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asking me if that part,</v>

2728
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:23.623
<v Speaker 3>then claiming that they can tell from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking skin on the cover on your </v>

2729
01:57:27.331 --> 01:57:29.340
<v Speaker 3>skull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the skin on your skull.</v>

2730
01:57:29.490 --> 01:57:32.160
<v Speaker 3>Like they can tell like did this is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>

2731
01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:34.950
<v Speaker 3>this is all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got an issue with your liver,</v>

2732
01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:37.170
<v Speaker 3>the liver area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I squeezed on pressure on it,</v>

2733
01:57:37.590 --> 01:57:38.670
<v Speaker 3>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2734
01:57:38.671 --> 01:57:43.390
<v Speaker 3>this is the liver right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so me and this guy get into it and so I,</v>

2735
01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:45.630
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm being respectful,</v>

2736
01:57:45.631 --> 01:57:46.890
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

2737
01:57:47.070 --> 01:57:49.110
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is called zone healing.</v>

2738
01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:51.060
<v Speaker 3>He's explaining this zone healing thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me and I'm like,</v>

2739
01:57:51.061 --> 01:57:51.990
<v Speaker 3>what did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2740
01:57:51.991 --> 01:57:53.940
<v Speaker 3>well it can cure all these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>diseases.</v>

2741
01:57:53.941 --> 01:57:54.774
<v Speaker 3>Don't talk to me about all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different autoimmune diseases that it </v>

2742
01:57:57.181 --> 01:57:58.830
<v Speaker 3>can cure and all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2743
01:57:58.831 --> 01:57:59.790
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how's it working?</v>

2744
01:57:59.791 --> 01:58:00.541
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2745
01:58:00.541 --> 01:58:01.374
<v Speaker 3>it's just the way that I'm manipulating </v>
<v Speaker 3>you in a certain way and the with the </v>

2746
01:58:05.611 --> 01:58:08.180
<v Speaker 3>frequencies and what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>

2747
01:58:08.190 --> 01:58:09.870
<v Speaker 3>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck is this working?</v>

2748
01:58:09.871 --> 01:58:11.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

2749
01:58:11.041 --> 01:58:14.460
<v Speaker 3>And so then we get to it and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you understand the placebo effect,</v>

2750
01:58:14.461 --> 01:58:15.091
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

2751
01:58:15.091 --> 01:58:15.924
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the placebo effect is you give </v>

2752
01:58:16.801 --> 01:58:17.634
<v Speaker 3>someone a sugar pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tell them what's medicine and </v>

2753
01:58:19.291 --> 01:58:21.360
<v Speaker 3>somehow or it magically heels from Ryan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2754
01:58:21.361 --> 01:58:22.530
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

2755
01:58:22.531 --> 01:58:23.770
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is essentially what we do.</v>

2756
01:58:23.771 --> 01:58:24.604
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're bullshitting and you're </v>

2757
01:58:25.981 --> 01:58:27.780
<v Speaker 3>letting these people's bodies heal </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

2758
01:58:27.781 --> 01:58:28.920
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't put it that way.</v>

2759
01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:29.833
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course you wouldn't put it that way </v>

2760
01:58:30.301 --> 01:58:32.000
<v Speaker 3>because you're charging money for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2761
01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:32.953
<v Speaker 3>Lisa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying that what you're doing </v>

2762
01:58:33.991 --> 01:58:35.610
<v Speaker 3>doesn't really do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2763
01:58:35.611 --> 01:58:36.880
<v Speaker 3>but it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2764
01:58:36.881 --> 01:58:37.980
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2765
01:58:37.981 --> 01:58:39.120
<v Speaker 3>if you believe in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>

2766
01:58:39.650 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Jesus fucking have to believe</v>

2767
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:43.480
<v Speaker 4>in penicillin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2768
01:58:43.481 --> 01:58:44.720
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's.</v>

2769
01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:45.633
<v Speaker 4>It was so disturbing to me because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>knew a bunch of guys who had gone to </v>

2770
01:58:47.591 --> 01:58:48.311
<v Speaker 4>them and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2771
01:58:48.311 --> 01:58:49.870
<v Speaker 4>this guy is fixing my knee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

2772
01:58:49.871 --> 01:58:50.704
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fixing your knee by adjusting your </v>

2773
01:58:52.481 --> 01:58:53.920
<v Speaker 4>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fixing your knee.</v>

2774
01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:54.813
<v Speaker 4>He's not fixing your knee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your knee is getting healed because </v>

2775
01:58:56.591 --> 01:58:58.960
<v Speaker 4>you're taking time off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to heal.</v>

2776
01:58:58.961 --> 01:59:00.520
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the body knows how to heal.</v>

2777
01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:03.430
<v Speaker 4>I want to reflexologist mechanic for my </v>
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Same thing as where they were.</v>

2779
01:59:06.930 --> 01:59:09.010
<v Speaker 4>They.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say that it's not just that they're</v>

2780
01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:09.873
<v Speaker 4>messing with your feet there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're giving a reflexology massage </v>

2781
01:59:11.741 --> 01:59:12.574
<v Speaker 4>where they tap on certain parts of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>feet and they say it's healing her </v>

2782
01:59:14.051 --> 01:59:14.884
<v Speaker 4>liver,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so give me a reflexologist mechanic so </v>

2783
01:59:16.991 --> 01:59:18.790
<v Speaker 4>that they're tapping on my tires and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2784
01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:18.971
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2785
01:59:18.971 --> 01:59:20.200
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm working on your radiator.</v>

2786
01:59:20.201 --> 01:59:21.270
<v Speaker 4>I want to see that.</v>

2787
01:59:21.410 --> 01:59:22.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not aware of reflexology.</v>

2788
01:59:22.891 --> 01:59:26.850
<v Speaker 3>I've seen those places where they show </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a chart of the feet and it looks.</v>

2789
01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Might as well be a fucking palm reader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2790
01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:34.500
<v Speaker 3>You're walking by and they have a one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those neon signs and so they.</v>

2791
01:59:34.530 --> 01:59:35.220
<v Speaker 3>What do they do?</v>

2792
01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:36.053
<v Speaker 4>They say that by tapping on certain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this part the arch is really your </v>

2793
01:59:38.911 --> 01:59:43.720
<v Speaker 4>liver and your toes are really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your arch is your liver or I'm not sure.</v>

2794
01:59:43.721 --> 01:59:46.230
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm but like that's the same shit.</v>

2795
01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:47.610
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like I said,</v>

2796
01:59:47.611 --> 01:59:49.560
<v Speaker 4>give me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give me like the Chiropractic,</v>

2797
01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:53.160
<v Speaker 4>a reflexologist of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the mechanic world.</v>

2798
01:59:53.161 --> 01:59:57.450
<v Speaker 4>I want them to start tapping on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on my oil tank and say,</v>

2799
01:59:57.451 --> 01:59:58.980
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fixing your alternator.</v>

2800
01:59:58.981 --> 02:00:03.030
<v Speaker 4>Like none of nobody does this shit for </v>
<v Speaker 4>cars because you know why your car won't</v>

2801
02:00:03.031 --> 02:00:03.864
<v Speaker 4>run.</v>

2802
02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:04.833
<v Speaker 3>There's a real problem with people </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying they know things that they don't </v>

2803
02:00:07.571 --> 02:00:08.404
<v Speaker 3>really know and I think people get </v>
<v Speaker 3>really upset by it and I think it's one </v>

2804
02:00:11.111 --> 02:00:11.944
<v Speaker 3>of the reasons why it's so important to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be honest about what you actually know </v>

2805
02:00:14.121 --> 02:00:15.840
<v Speaker 3>and when you don't actually know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

2806
02:00:15.850 --> 02:00:16.683
<v Speaker 3>I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That to me is like the most important </v>

2807
02:00:18.551 --> 02:00:19.384
<v Speaker 3>currency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you should never give up how you </v>

2808
02:00:21.611 --> 02:00:25.150
<v Speaker 3>honestly feel and what you honestly </v>
<v Speaker 3>think and what you honestly know about.</v>

2809
02:00:25.151 --> 02:00:25.984
<v Speaker 3>Something and as soon as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so as soon as you are a fucking </v>

2810
02:00:27.611 --> 02:00:32.320
<v Speaker 3>astrologer or a card reader or a palm </v>
<v Speaker 3>reader or a psychic,</v>

2811
02:00:32.370 --> 02:00:34.950
<v Speaker 3>you're a bullshit artist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is you,</v>

2812
02:00:34.951 --> 02:00:35.520
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2813
02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:38.830
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason you exist is because we can't</v>

2814
02:00:38.831 --> 02:00:39.664
<v Speaker 3>really read minds because if I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that you don't really know that if </v>

2815
02:00:42.191 --> 02:00:44.260
<v Speaker 3>I could see a little Turkey tests or pop</v>
<v Speaker 3>up on your head,</v>

2816
02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:46.210
<v Speaker 3>well I know you're full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2817
02:00:46.211 --> 02:00:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking tester popped up,</v>

2818
02:00:47.921 --> 02:00:48.310
<v Speaker 3>homie.</v>

2819
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:49.720
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the way you.</v>

2820
02:00:49.721 --> 02:00:50.554
<v Speaker 4>I think if anyone out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm guessing your audience </v>

2821
02:00:52.751 --> 02:00:55.360
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have a lot of people who believe</v>
<v Speaker 4>in psychics,</v>

2822
02:00:55.361 --> 02:00:56.530
<v Speaker 4>but if anyone should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>

2823
02:00:56.590 --> 02:00:57.423
<v Speaker 4>If anyone out there truly believes in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychic walk into one and when they ask </v>

2824
02:01:00.281 --> 02:01:02.050
<v Speaker 4>you your name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just walk right the fuck back out.</v>

2825
02:01:02.051 --> 02:01:04.510
<v Speaker 4>Because if they were a real psychic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would know you were coming and they</v>

2826
02:01:04.511 --> 02:01:05.440
<v Speaker 4>would know your name.</v>

2827
02:01:05.670 --> 02:01:07.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they weren't paying attention.</v>

2828
02:01:07.830 --> 02:01:09.510
<v Speaker 3>They to check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you're lying.</v>

2829
02:01:09.511 --> 02:01:10.440
<v Speaker 3>If you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my name is Fred,</v>

2830
02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:11.041
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2831
02:01:11.041 --> 02:01:11.500
<v Speaker 3>mark,</v>

2832
02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:12.333
<v Speaker 4>so just walk right in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Walk right in and give them a false </v>

2833
02:01:15.041 --> 02:01:16.240
<v Speaker 4>story and see if they check it.</v>

2834
02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:18.530
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who went to a psychic </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>

2835
02:01:18.531 --> 02:01:20.270

<v Speaker 3>They're really good at reading.</v>

02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:56.293
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things he said it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>about getting the script back for the </v>

2853
02:01:59.211 --> 02:02:00.044
<v Speaker 2>chiropractic episode and they have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>really careful with how they wrote the </v>

2854
02:02:03.201 --> 02:02:06.120
<v Speaker 2>episodes of bullshit bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2855
02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:08.980
<v Speaker 2>great show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was funny because like I,</v>

2856
02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:09.993
<v Speaker 2>I turned into a skeptic from watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>that show and it was just great because </v>

2857
02:02:15.441 --> 02:02:15.741
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2858
02:02:15.741 --> 02:02:16.574
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'd never heard her talk </v>

2859
02:02:17.631 --> 02:02:21.020
<v Speaker 2>before I got to know that group and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like that was,</v>

2860
02:02:21.050 --> 02:02:22.850
<v Speaker 2>that was the first time because I Chit </v>
<v Speaker 2>chatted with,</v>

2861
02:02:22.851 --> 02:02:23.684
<v Speaker 2>tell her a little bit before because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to know penn first and hearing </v>

2862
02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:27.833
<v Speaker 2>teller describe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like after I started doing the sybase </v>

2863
02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:32.720
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm chatting with him about that.</v>

2864
02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:34.550
<v Speaker 2>I got a little insight into his brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2865
02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:35.653
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got the script back from legal and </v>

2866
02:02:36.981 --> 02:02:39.620
<v Speaker 2>they said just call the chiropractor's </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers.</v>

2867
02:02:41.590 --> 02:02:42.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside.</v>

2868
02:02:42.861 --> 02:02:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta keep my composition,</v>

2869
02:02:44.361 --> 02:02:45.194
<v Speaker 2>but my lord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like hearing teller say mother </v>

2870
02:02:47.251 --> 02:02:48.084
<v Speaker 2>fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2871
02:02:48.650 --> 02:02:51.770
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like something penn would </v>
<v Speaker 2>say takes these motherfuckers.</v>

2872
02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:54.140
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's basically everything you hear in</v>

2873
02:02:54.141 --> 02:02:54.861
<v Speaker 2>pens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tone of voice.</v>

2874
02:02:54.861 --> 02:02:57.710
<v Speaker 2>You have to hear it in this tone of </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>

2875
02:02:57.750 --> 02:02:58.583
<v Speaker 2>Like I've learned a lot about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned a lot about skeptic being </v>

2876
02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:04.453
<v Speaker 2>responsibly from him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I've always taken </v>

2877
02:03:05.961 --> 02:03:08.160
<v Speaker 2>away is don't blame the victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2878
02:03:08.210 --> 02:03:09.043
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that I've kept with me </v>

2879
02:03:09.981 --> 02:03:11.220
<v Speaker 2>and I'll always keep with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2880
02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:13.970
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been a big influence on my work and</v>

2881
02:03:13.971 --> 02:03:15.380
<v Speaker 2>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been helpful.</v>

2882
02:03:15.790 --> 02:03:17.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've all been hoodwinked,</v>

2883
02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:18.653
<v Speaker 3>mean at some stage of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's your parents telling you </v>

2884
02:03:20.801 --> 02:03:23.490
<v Speaker 3>about Santa Claus or something along the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2885
02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:28.800
<v Speaker 3>We've been tricked and it's not your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fault that you got tricked the prop man.</v>

2886
02:03:28.841 --> 02:03:29.674
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's not even the fault of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>person's tricking if they're being </v>

2887
02:03:31.601 --> 02:03:32.434
<v Speaker 3>sincere and they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just misinformed and they don't </v>

2888
02:03:34.601 --> 02:03:37.330
<v Speaker 3>understand what they're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually harmful.</v>

2889
02:03:37.690 --> 02:03:41.890
<v Speaker 3>And then they fight for their cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they have this thing that they do,</v>

2890
02:03:42.070 --> 02:03:45.760
<v Speaker 3>whether it's chiropractic or whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's being an astrologer or whatever.</v>

2891
02:03:45.970 --> 02:03:46.803
<v Speaker 3>Then they like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they dig in and they defend their turf </v>

2892
02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:50.540
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

2893
02:03:50.710 --> 02:03:52.620
<v Speaker 3>I apologize for interrupting or saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>about band check.</v>

2894
02:03:52.621 --> 02:03:53.454
<v Speaker 3>It's or if you were about to go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they fold people at their fake </v>

2895
02:03:56.201 --> 02:03:57.700
<v Speaker 3>site,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put the fake psychic.</v>

2896
02:03:57.701 --> 02:03:58.301
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>

2897
02:03:58.301 --> 02:04:00.610
<v Speaker 3>He is at reading people and we had him </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2898
02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:02.790
<v Speaker 3>I did a show called Joe Rogan questions </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2899
02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:03.883
<v Speaker 3>And Bennett check was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>episodes where he was explaining to me </v>

2900
02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:08.313
<v Speaker 3>how they do cold read and explained to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me how they lead people into giving him </v>

2901
02:04:12.851 --> 02:04:17.140
<v Speaker 3>enough information that he can form a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable assessment of who they are.</v>

2902
02:04:17.141 --> 02:04:21.340
<v Speaker 3>And then he would answer certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asked certain leading questions and he's</v>

2903
02:04:21.341 --> 02:04:23.290
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just done this so many times,</v>

2904
02:04:23.291 --> 02:04:24.124
<v Speaker 3>I know how to get the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people are shocked and they don't </v>

2905
02:04:26.051 --> 02:04:28.150
<v Speaker 3>know what to do and they've never done </v>
<v Speaker 3>this before.</v>

2906
02:04:28.151 --> 02:04:28.820
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2907
02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:29.653
<v Speaker 3>it's like you can ask them questions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start giving you information and </v>

2908
02:04:32.201 --> 02:04:34.260
<v Speaker 3>like your parents were divorced when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were young.</v>

2909
02:04:34.630 --> 02:04:35.920
<v Speaker 3>How do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's,</v>

2910
02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:38.370
<v Speaker 3>it's so common,</v>

2911
02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:39.690
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2912
02:04:39.691 --> 02:04:43.320
<v Speaker 4>you can read certain things from people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

2913
02:04:43.321 --> 02:04:45.030
<v Speaker 4>he showed us a bunch of shit that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>does,</v>

2914
02:04:45.031 --> 02:04:45.864
<v Speaker 4>like the spoon bending thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of different things that people </v>

2915
02:04:48.901 --> 02:04:49.734
<v Speaker 4>want you to say that it's magic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny because there's a big </v>

2916
02:04:52.861 --> 02:04:55.500
<v Speaker 4>crossover with the magician community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2917
02:04:55.501 --> 02:04:56.334
<v Speaker 4>and the skeptic community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's because they know how easy it </v>

2918
02:04:58.441 --> 02:05:01.770
<v Speaker 4>is to trick the fuck out of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I kind of love that.</v>

2919
02:05:01.771 --> 02:05:02.604
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been interesting to see this group </v>

2920
02:05:03.991 --> 02:05:04.824
<v Speaker 4>of entertainers that people think of as </v>
<v Speaker 4>goofballs be this kind of a little bit </v>

2921
02:05:08.311 --> 02:05:10.880
<v Speaker 4>of a bastion of intellectual ism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I,</v>

2922
02:05:10.881 --> 02:05:13.350
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to get people to pay attention</v>

2923
02:05:13.351 --> 02:05:14.184
<v Speaker 4>to anything on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you make it funny and you add a </v>

2924
02:05:16.531 --> 02:05:18.210
<v Speaker 4>Dick joke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly people are like,</v>

2925
02:05:18.211 --> 02:05:19.500
<v Speaker 4>I got to learn about this.</v>

2926
02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:22.050
<v Speaker 4>So that's why Penn and teller think are </v>
<v Speaker 4>so important.</v>

2927
02:05:22.051 --> 02:05:25.800
<v Speaker 4>Because they were the first magicians </v>
<v Speaker 4>who were really adamant and what they're</v>

2928
02:05:25.801 --> 02:05:27.900
<v Speaker 4>doing is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2929
02:05:28.650 --> 02:05:29.640
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're tricking you.</v>

2930
02:05:29.641 --> 02:05:30.474
<v Speaker 4>And they use that word trick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I liked that they were really good </v>

2931
02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:34.440
<v Speaker 4>at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's still going to be awesome.</v>

2932
02:05:34.441 --> 02:05:36.120
<v Speaker 4>You're still going to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And every grade time.</v>

2933
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:37.820
<v Speaker 4>And they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were totally upfront.</v>

2934
02:05:37.890 --> 02:05:38.491
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2935
02:05:38.491 --> 02:05:41.490
<v Speaker 4>there's no magic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're motherfucking tricking you.</v>

2936
02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:43.440
<v Speaker 4>There's shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God Damn.</v>

2937
02:05:43.441 --> 02:05:44.274
<v Speaker 4>Those shows were hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of those bullshit shows with a </v>

2938
02:05:45.841 --> 02:05:47.420
<v Speaker 4>catch people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>

2939
02:05:47.490 --> 02:05:48.323
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nonsense that they're promoting </v>

2940
02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:52.230
<v Speaker 4>pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of my favorite ones is there was a,</v>

2941
02:05:52.231 --> 02:05:54.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was an episode where they attacked</v>

2942
02:05:54.061 --> 02:05:54.894
<v Speaker 4>organic food and they did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is this thing where people </v>

2943
02:05:57.601 --> 02:05:59.730
<v Speaker 4>doubled down on things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2944
02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:01.560
<v Speaker 4>they took a banana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cut it in half,</v>

2945
02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:04.230
<v Speaker 4>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe a conventionally grown banana.</v>

2946
02:06:04.230 --> 02:06:06.480
<v Speaker 4>And on one plate they'd say it was an </v>
<v Speaker 4>organic banana.</v>

2947
02:06:06.481 --> 02:06:09.240
<v Speaker 4>The other plate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd say it was a organic,</v>

2948
02:06:09.241 --> 02:06:10.074
<v Speaker 4>the other plate a conventionally grown </v>
<v Speaker 4>and have people take a bite out of each </v>

2949
02:06:12.361 --> 02:06:14.210
<v Speaker 4>one and people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2950
02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:15.053
<v Speaker 4>they'd sit there describing the organic </v>
<v Speaker 4>banana is creamy and sweet and tastes </v>

2951
02:06:18.451 --> 02:06:19.680
<v Speaker 4>like a banana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should taste.</v>

2952
02:06:19.681 --> 02:06:21.420
<v Speaker 4>And the conventionally grown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2953
02:06:21.421 --> 02:06:24.210
<v Speaker 4>it's really bland and it doesn't taste </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

2954
02:06:24.211 --> 02:06:26.790
<v Speaker 4>And this one girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after they explained to quote pen,</v>

2955
02:06:26.791 --> 02:06:31.700
<v Speaker 4>it's the same fucking but m and this one</v>
<v Speaker 4>girl afterwards,</v>

2956
02:06:31.710 --> 02:06:34.410
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it makes me question my,</v>

2957
02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:36.840
<v Speaker 4>my opinion of organic versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>conventional.</v>

2958
02:06:36.841 --> 02:06:39.900
<v Speaker 4>It really makes me question the concept </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the banana.</v>

2959
02:06:39.901 --> 02:06:42.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh girl,</v>

2960
02:06:42.991 --> 02:06:46.260
<v Speaker 4>you're going to waste so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pulled it off.</v>

2961
02:06:46.650 --> 02:06:48.750
<v Speaker 4>I got mad at me yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

2962
02:06:48.751 --> 02:06:50.140
<v Speaker 4>The dumb girl wants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's,</v>

2963
02:06:50.380 --> 02:06:51.890
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2964
02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:53.120
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2965
02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:53.970
<v Speaker 4>it's a skill.</v>

2966
02:06:53.970 --> 02:06:56.040
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the skills I bring to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>table.</v>

2967
02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:59.170
<v Speaker 4>We can get away with it though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's girls can get away with it.</v>

2968
02:06:59.230 --> 02:07:00.070
<v Speaker 4>I'd say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2969
02:07:00.170 --> 02:07:02.760
<v Speaker 4>I think I thought I got an okay </v>
<v Speaker 4>impression of Penn,</v>

2970
02:07:02.761 --> 02:07:03.594
<v Speaker 4>but no yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no it just enough attempting to destroy </v>

2971
02:07:09.031 --> 02:07:09.864
<v Speaker 4>my vocal cords will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will produce a pen impression almost </v>

2972
02:07:12.630 --> 02:07:17.250
<v Speaker 4>what I think it's a unique time for </v>
<v Speaker 4>exposing bullshit and you know,</v>

2973
02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:20.940
<v Speaker 4>because there's enough articles and </v>
<v Speaker 4>videos and there's enough.</v>

2974
02:07:20.970 --> 02:07:23.790
<v Speaker 4>Like you can kind of get a sense like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh I see a pattern here.</v>

2975
02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:24.773
<v Speaker 4>People are a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people are tired of not knowing </v>

2976
02:07:27.781 --> 02:07:28.614
<v Speaker 4>what's real on the Internet and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>partially like this whole trend with </v>

2977
02:07:30.331 --> 02:07:32.790
<v Speaker 4>fake news and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

2978
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:36.080
<v Speaker 4>there's kind of a breaking point I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of what people</v>

2979
02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:36.953
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are willing to accept a for just shit </v>

2980
02:07:40.121 --> 02:07:43.960
<v Speaker 2>being spewed on the Internet and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted as real because there's so much</v>

2981
02:07:43.961 --> 02:07:44.794
<v Speaker 2>content out there and people want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend their time reading stuff that's </v>

2982
02:07:49.031 --> 02:07:53.140
<v Speaker 2>for real and that they can trust and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to trust shitty sources,</v>

2983
02:07:53.141 --> 02:07:54.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they want to go,</v>

2984
02:07:54.641 --> 02:07:56.170
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a source I can trust,</v>

2985
02:07:56.171 --> 02:07:59.380
<v Speaker 2>I can keep going back to this website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get good information.</v>

2986
02:07:59.660 --> 02:08:01.690
<v Speaker 2>And they want things explained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2987
02:08:01.691 --> 02:08:04.800
<v Speaker 2>that they know was researched well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2988
02:08:04.801 --> 02:08:05.634
<v Speaker 2>I think that this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a valuable good to offer out to </v>

2989
02:08:09.071 --> 02:08:10.240
<v Speaker 2>people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2990
02:08:10.241 --> 02:08:11.074
<v Speaker 2>here's something real and here's some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's a Dick joke to read while </v>

2991
02:08:13.331 --> 02:08:16.690
<v Speaker 2>you're reading something real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I am for a good Dick joke to,</v>

2992
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:18.310
<v Speaker 2>to research ratio</v>

2993
02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:19.813
<v Speaker 3>for as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when you did this article and you </v>

2994
02:08:22.011 --> 02:08:24.380
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said it was 4,000 words,</v>

2995
02:08:24.381 --> 02:08:28.050
<v Speaker 3>it's a particularly long article.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you have to omit?</v>

2996
02:08:28.070 --> 02:08:28.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did it seems like,</v>

2997
02:08:29.350 --> 02:08:31.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're dealing with 4,000 words,</v>

2998
02:08:31.551 --> 02:08:32.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it just the,</v>

2999
02:08:32.330 --> 02:08:35.720
<v Speaker 3>the comprehensive coverage on why </v>
<v Speaker 3>chiropractic websites bullshit?</v>

3000
02:08:35.721 --> 02:08:36.830
<v Speaker 3>Or is it just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3001
02:08:37.050 --> 02:08:37.883
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotTa keep this thing as tight as I </v>

3002
02:08:38.961 --> 02:08:40.120
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's so much to.</v>

3003
02:08:40.590 --> 02:08:41.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3004
02:08:41.220 --> 02:08:43.110
<v Speaker 2>I was going to joke while I do get paid </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the word.</v>

3005
02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:45.193
<v Speaker 2>Well that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't like I never go into it </v>

3006
02:08:47.671 --> 02:08:48.504
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's make it as long as I can or make </v>

3007
02:08:49.471 --> 02:08:52.770
<v Speaker 2>it as short as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We like I'm a contributing writer at the</v>

3008
02:08:52.771 --> 02:08:53.910
<v Speaker 2>outline now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3009
02:08:53.911 --> 02:08:56.730
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's whenever we write a piece,</v>

3010
02:08:56.731 --> 02:08:57.564
<v Speaker 2>it's always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's make it cover the topic in as </v>

3011
02:09:00.901 --> 02:09:03.720
<v Speaker 2>entertaining and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as,</v>

3012
02:09:04.150 --> 02:09:06.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as cohesive as a,</v>

3013
02:09:06.651 --> 02:09:08.640
<v Speaker 2>of a story as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm old.</v>

3014
02:09:08.641 --> 02:09:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go.</v>

3015
02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:14.040
<v Speaker 2>We kind of say what points do we want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cover in this piece?</v>

3016
02:09:14.041 --> 02:09:17.940
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's basically to tell a good story.</v>

3017
02:09:17.941 --> 02:09:18.774
<v Speaker 2>And My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my goal whenever I write an article in </v>

3018
02:09:19.681 --> 02:09:22.850
<v Speaker 2>something is let's write the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3019
02:09:22.890 --> 02:09:26.220
<v Speaker 2>let's write a piece so that I never have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cover this topic again.</v>

3020
02:09:26.490 --> 02:09:28.980
<v Speaker 2>And with Chiropractic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I like,</v>

3021
02:09:28.981 --> 02:09:29.814
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing I would have liked to have </v>

3022
02:09:31.291 --> 02:09:33.300
<v Speaker 2>covered if somehow we could have made it</v>
<v Speaker 2>like either,</v>

3023
02:09:33.301 --> 02:09:33.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3024
02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:34.473
<v Speaker 2>if somehow we could have condensed it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little so we could have fit something </v>

3025
02:09:36.931 --> 02:09:37.764
<v Speaker 2>else in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have maybe added an a piece on </v>

3026
02:09:40.501 --> 02:09:41.031
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're science,</v>

3027
02:09:41.031 --> 02:09:43.410
<v Speaker 2>science-based chiropractors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible?</v>

3028
02:09:43.930 --> 02:09:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Here's an impossible to be a science </v>
<v Speaker 2>based card reader.</v>

3029
02:09:47.100 --> 02:09:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the problem is like,</v>

3030
02:09:48.661 --> 02:09:50.790
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was,</v>

3031
02:09:50.940 --> 02:09:54.980
<v Speaker 2>we tried to present one point of view </v>
<v Speaker 2>while still giving a hat too.</v>

3032
02:09:54.981 --> 02:09:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Like we included a link on some </v>
<v Speaker 2>chiropractors that are showing,</v>

3033
02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:00.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're trying to be science based.</v>

3034
02:10:00.721 --> 02:10:01.554
<v Speaker 2>So I think that adding in a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>section on it would have maybe </v>

3035
02:10:03.331 --> 02:10:05.910
<v Speaker 2>diminished from the point of view of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So being,</v>

3036
02:10:05.970 --> 02:10:06.803
<v Speaker 2>making it good reading and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cohesive point of view is always </v>

3037
02:10:10.051 --> 02:10:11.010
<v Speaker 2>important to the article.</v>

3038
02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:12.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let me stop you there.</v>

3039
02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:17.440
<v Speaker 3>You say chiropractor science based.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was bullshit when it started,</v>

3040
02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:20.680
<v Speaker 3>if it was something that was created by </v>
<v Speaker 3>a magnetic healer,</v>

3041
02:10:20.681 --> 02:10:22.930
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a nonsense thing that came from a</v>

3042
02:10:22.931 --> 02:10:26.500
<v Speaker 3>seance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does that ever become science based?</v>

3043
02:10:26.501 --> 02:10:28.570
<v Speaker 3>If the original,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the origin.</v>

3044
02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:32.980
<v Speaker 3>It's not based on medical research where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they figured out that if you do,</v>

3045
02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's all</v>

3046
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:35.960
<v Speaker 2>the studies that we've shown when you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3047
02:10:36.110 --> 02:10:39.240
<v Speaker 2>this is the immune system responds to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the body has to be in.</v>

3048
02:10:39.250 --> 02:10:40.130
<v Speaker 2>There's none of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3049
02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:41.520
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there is,</v>

3050
02:10:41.690 --> 02:10:42.523
<v Speaker 2>there is some and it some but the minor </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence but subjective pain relief and </v>

3051
02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:47.753
<v Speaker 2>that's it and I don't want to diminish </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that I'm sure </v>

3052
02:10:49.941 --> 02:10:52.820
<v Speaker 2>people are sitting there like with </v>
<v Speaker 2>daggers still mad at us for saying,</v>

3053
02:10:52.821 --> 02:10:54.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for questioning their,</v>

3054
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:54.883
<v Speaker 2>their subjective experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to tell people that they </v>

3055
02:10:57.501 --> 02:11:01.220
<v Speaker 2>did not feel relief from what they cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain is.</v>

3056
02:11:01.221 --> 02:11:03.320
<v Speaker 2>It's really subjective and it's hard to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manage.</v>

3057
02:11:03.620 --> 02:11:04.453
<v Speaker 2>So I think that there are chiropractors </v>
<v Speaker 2>who aim specifically to relieve lower </v>

3058
02:11:08.141 --> 02:11:09.250
<v Speaker 2>back pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3059
02:11:09.251 --> 02:11:11.750
<v Speaker 2>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you aim just to do that,</v>

3060
02:11:12.010 --> 02:11:12.843
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your chiropractic practice while </v>

3061
02:11:14.211 --> 02:11:15.380
<v Speaker 2>still telling people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3062
02:11:15.381 --> 02:11:18.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm just doing this while you go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical therapy,</v>

3063
02:11:18.260 --> 02:11:20.420
<v Speaker 2>you should still be going to a physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapist.</v>

3064
02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:21.403
<v Speaker 2>This is an adjunctive things solely to </v>
<v Speaker 2>relieve pain and they try to see how it </v>

3065
02:11:26.511 --> 02:11:30.380
<v Speaker 2>can just relieve pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible that,</v>

3066
02:11:30.381 --> 02:11:31.214
<v Speaker 2>that can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that adding that into the </v>

3067
02:11:32.121 --> 02:11:34.610
<v Speaker 2>article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes away from it a bit,</v>

3068
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:35.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's,</v>

3069
02:11:35.950 --> 02:11:37.520
<v Speaker 2>that's not part of the article's point </v>
<v Speaker 2>of view.</v>

3070
02:11:37.521 --> 02:11:38.354
<v Speaker 2>And it's also not part of my point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>view of how it's not a science based </v>

3071
02:11:41.541 --> 02:11:43.100
<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that,</v>

3072
02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:45.530
<v Speaker 2>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some ethical chiropractors,</v>

3073
02:11:45.531 --> 02:11:47.280
<v Speaker 2>there's Sam Homo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pamela.</v>

3074
02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:48.133
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure how to pronounce his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard it said out loud </v>

3075
02:11:49.821 --> 02:11:50.720
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3076
02:11:50.721 --> 02:11:53.600
<v Speaker 2>but that was one of the chiropractors </v>
<v Speaker 2>who I cited in there who,</v>

3077
02:11:53.601 --> 02:11:54.434
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's continued to practice while </v>

3078
02:11:55.251 --> 02:11:56.084
<v Speaker 2>speaking out against the Chiropractic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very vocally speaking out against </v>

3079
02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Chiropractic as a whole because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen that it can,</v>

3080
02:12:02.061 --> 02:12:02.894
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there is some adult manipulating </v>

3081
02:12:04.191 --> 02:12:06.410
<v Speaker 2>back he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's what's going on there,</v>

3082
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:07.760
<v Speaker 2>what does that do?</v>

3083
02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:08.593
<v Speaker 2>And that's what all the things where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like I'm in a gray area because I </v>

3084
02:12:10.611 --> 02:12:11.444
<v Speaker 2>don't want to diminish the people who've</v>
<v Speaker 2>said that it's helped them have pain </v>

3085
02:12:14.991 --> 02:12:15.824
<v Speaker 2>relief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also think these people should be </v>

3086
02:12:16.551 --> 02:12:18.130
<v Speaker 2>going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3087
02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:20.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a,</v>

3088
02:12:20.361 --> 02:12:21.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3089
02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:23.660
<v Speaker 2>to a physical therapist and a massage </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapist.</v>

3090
02:12:23.661 --> 02:12:27.800
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not sure what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what the exact right answer</v>

3091
02:12:27.801 --> 02:12:29.420
<v Speaker 2>is on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone says,</v>

3092
02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:30.433
<v Speaker 2>I've been to a physical therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been to a massage therapist and </v>

3093
02:12:33.741 --> 02:12:35.870
<v Speaker 2>this is the only thing that's ever made </v>
<v Speaker 2>it feel better.</v>

3094
02:12:35.871 --> 02:12:37.520
<v Speaker 2>And I went in one session,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you say?</v>

3095
02:12:37.580 --> 02:12:38.413
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know where the exact right </v>

3096
02:12:40.521 --> 02:12:43.820
<v Speaker 2>answer is to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it all started from bullshit,</v>

3097
02:12:43.821 --> 02:12:46.580
<v Speaker 2>it seems so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the foundation is bullshit.</v>

3098
02:12:46.581 --> 02:12:47.414
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean I went to a guy that was </v>

3099
02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:49.843
<v Speaker 2>really good at a bunch of other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he would give you a dms electrical </v>

3100
02:12:52.761 --> 02:12:54.680
<v Speaker 2>muscular pads on.</v>

3101
02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:56.910
<v Speaker 2>I have one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a small little car.</v>

3102
02:12:56.930 --> 02:13:00.380
<v Speaker 2>He had really good massage therapist who</v>
<v Speaker 2>provided physical therapy.</v>

3103
02:13:00.381 --> 02:13:02.720
<v Speaker 2>He had a little gym set up at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day.</v>

3104
02:13:02.730 --> 02:13:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Still cracking backs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3105
02:13:04.251 --> 02:13:05.600
<v Speaker 2>here's a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if,</v>

3106
02:13:05.630 --> 02:13:09.230
<v Speaker 2>and this is again at this completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetical,</v>

3107
02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:10.213
<v Speaker 2>what if it hadn't been started by this </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutjob back into killer and it was a </v>

3108
02:13:12.921 --> 02:13:14.210
<v Speaker 2>doctor who said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3109
02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:16.730
<v Speaker 2>this can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this can help.</v>

3110
02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:17.773
<v Speaker 2>And if it was a just an osteopath who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was trying to see if this could help </v>

3111
02:13:21.141 --> 02:13:23.060
<v Speaker 2>relieve pain along with physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy.</v>

3112
02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:26.000
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I encourage people if they're,</v>

3113
02:13:26.180 --> 02:13:28.730
<v Speaker 2>if they are looking for a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulation can help,</v>

3114
02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:29.833
<v Speaker 2>maybe not go to a chiropractor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but seek out in your medical practice </v>

3115
02:13:33.061 --> 02:13:33.894
<v Speaker 2>and osteopath who can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows much more about anatomy and </v>

3116
02:13:36.661 --> 02:13:37.494
<v Speaker 2>please keep going to a physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapist and maybe a massage therapist </v>

3117
02:13:40.201 --> 02:13:40.770
<v Speaker 2>because ms dot.</v>

3118
02:13:40.770 --> 02:13:43.700
<v Speaker 2>I just feel fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's just,</v>

3119
02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:46.470
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3120
02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:50.220
<v Speaker 2>there's like science based ones when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>all started out with bullshit,</v>

3121
02:13:50.221 --> 02:13:50.910
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3122
02:13:50.910 --> 02:13:53.580
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be very hard for you to find a,</v>

3123
02:13:53.610 --> 02:13:54.443
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote science based </v>

3124
02:13:55.291 --> 02:13:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Chiropractor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>

3125
02:13:56.941 --> 02:13:57.631
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3126
02:13:57.631 --> 02:13:59.700
<v Speaker 2>if the only thing that's relieving your </v>
<v Speaker 2>back pain and I get it,</v>

3127
02:13:59.701 --> 02:14:00.390
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3128
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:04.710
<v Speaker 2>I have scoliosis back pain issues are </v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard to manage a,</v>

3129
02:14:04.711 --> 02:14:05.544
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an osteopath will understand your </v>

3130
02:14:07.021 --> 02:14:07.854
<v Speaker 2>anatomy much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to say you have to </v>

3131
02:14:09.511 --> 02:14:10.344
<v Speaker 2>come back in three times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to send you to a physical </v>

3132
02:14:12.631 --> 02:14:15.150
<v Speaker 2>therapist and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe recommended massage,</v>

3133
02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:16.860
<v Speaker 2>but they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll do it in a,</v>

3134
02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:18.600
<v Speaker 2>in an ethical fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3135
02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:21.450
<v Speaker 2>and not overstep their reached.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

3136
02:14:21.451 --> 02:14:22.284
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is some evidence that it helps </v>

3137
02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:29.040
<v Speaker 2>with lower back pain but not more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical therapy or massage.</v>

3138
02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:29.873
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what people should take away </v>

3139
02:14:31.051 --> 02:14:33.300
<v Speaker 2>from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it can't do anything,</v>

3140
02:14:33.301 --> 02:14:34.134
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it's not the best thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's also a problem because most </v>

3141
02:14:37.081 --> 02:14:42.081
<v Speaker 2>chiropractors also incorporate massage </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so hard to decide like what,</v>

3142
02:14:43.110 --> 02:14:44.570
<v Speaker 2>what is helping you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3143
02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:46.740
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

3144
02:14:46.741 --> 02:14:49.620
<v Speaker 2>and I get it like I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>

3145
02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I think the hardest part is telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that their subjective experiences</v>

3146
02:14:52.890 --> 02:14:54.780
<v Speaker 2>wrong because that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

3147
02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:56.133
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be that asshole who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like necessarily you're saying it's </v>

3148
02:14:57.751 --> 02:14:58.584
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're saying reevaluate what the </v>

3149
02:15:00.301 --> 02:15:01.950
<v Speaker 2>root cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3150
02:15:01.951 --> 02:15:04.430
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I mean.</v>

3151
02:15:04.450 --> 02:15:07.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you went to a chiropractor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not stupid.</v>

3152
02:15:07.171 --> 02:15:08.970
<v Speaker 2>You're not wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not a moron.</v>

3153
02:15:09.140 --> 02:15:09.661
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3154
02:15:09.661 --> 02:15:10.494
<v Speaker 2>you're someone who's suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I both have both of us understand </v>

3155
02:15:13.561 --> 02:15:14.430
<v Speaker 2>that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3156
02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:15.353
<v Speaker 2>make sure you're not being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the person who's selling to you </v>

3157
02:15:17.941 --> 02:15:18.774
<v Speaker 2>isn't selling a line and not telling you</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it can fix your immune system and </v>

3158
02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:25.120
<v Speaker 2>cure your baby to the point where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't need to.</v>

3159
02:15:25.420 --> 02:15:26.253
<v Speaker 2>Please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't let someone do that to you </v>

3160
02:15:28.261 --> 02:15:32.640
<v Speaker 2>because measles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>measles is a real thing that can.</v>

3161
02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:36.680
<v Speaker 2>I was hoping cough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Ian.</v>

3162
02:15:36.700 --> 02:15:37.533
<v Speaker 2>This is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3163
02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:38.431
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3164
02:15:38.431 --> 02:15:39.091
<v Speaker 2>did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3165
02:15:39.091 --> 02:15:40.000
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3166
02:15:40.110 --> 02:15:42.780
<v Speaker 2>have you ever gotten a whooping cough?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because once I got it,</v>

3167
02:15:43.290 --> 02:15:46.380
<v Speaker 2>I got it as an adults because in this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

3168
02:15:46.410 --> 02:15:47.243
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do need to make a new whooping </v>

3169
02:15:48.571 --> 02:15:50.610
<v Speaker 2>cough vaccine that is not a reason not </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get it.</v>

3170
02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Please get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please re up it.</v>

3171
02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:55.590
<v Speaker 2>But the whooping cough vaccine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they made it a,</v>

3172
02:15:55.591 --> 02:15:59.100
<v Speaker 2>some strains of it wore off faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3173
02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:03.690
<v Speaker 2>than was originally expected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody came into my lab and we were,</v>

3174
02:16:03.691 --> 02:16:04.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were given,</v>

3175
02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:05.521
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3176
02:16:05.521 --> 02:16:08.250
<v Speaker 2>along with our packages working to labs </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

3177
02:16:08.490 --> 02:16:10.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm at a drug testing lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3178
02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:11.113
<v Speaker 2>we were given health insurance and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was around the time of the first </v>

3179
02:16:13.170 --> 02:16:14.410
<v Speaker 2>obamacare debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3180
02:16:14.430 --> 02:16:16.530
<v Speaker 2>when people are all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to buy healthcare.</v>

3181
02:16:16.770 --> 02:16:18.210
<v Speaker 2>And one of the guys in the lab who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

3182
02:16:18.211 --> 02:16:19.680
<v Speaker 2>why should I get healthcare?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm healthy.</v>

3183
02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:22.710
<v Speaker 2>He showed up with whooping cough and for</v>
<v Speaker 2>two weeks we didn't know he had it.</v>

3184
02:16:22.711 --> 02:16:24.000
<v Speaker 2>He was just sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone's like,</v>

3185
02:16:24.001 --> 02:16:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Craig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the doctor,</v>

3186

<v Speaker 2>go to the doctor,</v>

3187
02:16:25.621 --> 02:16:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Craig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the doctor,</v>

3188
02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:30.340
<v Speaker 2>five of us got whooping cough from one </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy from one guy.</v>

3189
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Let him hear the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Craig.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's fucking Craig,</v>

<v Speaker 2>a torn ligament in my hip running an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultra marathon.</v>

3201
02:16:53.050 --> 02:16:53.883
<v Speaker 2>It's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was hitting a car accident and got </v>

<v Speaker 2>whooping cough with it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I had no vacation time left to miss </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

3205
02:17:02.201 --> 02:17:04.060

<v Speaker 2>on me.</v>

3206
02:17:04.350 --> 02:17:07.280
<v Speaker 2>Buddy of mine runs ultra marathons all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time there.</v>

3207
02:17:07.570 --> 02:17:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize at the time that I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>a joint disorder.</v>

3208
02:17:10.190 --> 02:17:11.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well don't run them a few of a buildup </v>

3209
02:17:13.530 --> 02:17:14.860
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

3210
02:17:14.861 --> 02:17:16.900
<v Speaker 2>You need to try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I trained properly,</v>

3211
02:17:16.901 --> 02:17:18.100
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize I'm like,</v>

3212
02:17:18.101 --> 02:17:20.620
<v Speaker 2>my hip is hurting and I went to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgeon and this is,</v>

3213
02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:21.693
<v Speaker 2>this is something that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that chiropractic does a yell about in </v>

3214
02:17:25.061 --> 02:17:25.894
<v Speaker 2>the pain care system and in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the medical system that they have a </v>

3215
02:17:28.061 --> 02:17:30.910
<v Speaker 2>point about Dr Stu throw pills at you </v>
<v Speaker 2>haphazardly.</v>

3216
02:17:30.970 --> 02:17:35.050
<v Speaker 2>My doctor and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never gonna not be mad about this.</v>

3217
02:17:35.350 --> 02:17:36.183
<v Speaker 2>My doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of saying we should do a scan </v>

3218
02:17:37.631 --> 02:17:38.464
<v Speaker 2>with contrast to see what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're really complaining about </v>

3219
02:17:40.661 --> 02:17:41.494
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chucked me a bottle of Vicodin and said </v>

3220
02:17:43.391 --> 02:17:45.850
<v Speaker 2>go ahead and run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3221
02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:48.960
<v Speaker 2>Doctor's name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3222
02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to say because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's,</v>

3223
02:17:51.300 --> 02:17:54.070
<v Speaker 2>there was that part of me that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really happy that I got to do my ultra.</v>

3224
02:17:54.071 --> 02:17:56.950
<v Speaker 2>But God damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you need Vicodin to run a marathon,</v>

3225
02:17:56.951 --> 02:17:59.380
<v Speaker 2>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Oh yeah.</v>

3226
02:17:59.381 --> 02:18:00.220
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean don't,</v>

3227
02:18:00.250 --> 02:18:01.083
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it was funny because after I </v>

3228
02:18:02.051 --> 02:18:02.681
<v Speaker 2>ran it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3229
02:18:02.681 --> 02:18:03.514
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to take the medication any </v>

3230
02:18:04.990 --> 02:18:08.410
<v Speaker 2>more because I'm not running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And suddenly I realized how fucked up my</v>

3231
02:18:08.411 --> 02:18:10.510
<v Speaker 2>hip was and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

3232
02:18:10.511 --> 02:18:12.050
<v Speaker 2>I can barely walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3233
02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:14.630
<v Speaker 2>what was wrong with him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tore a ligament or a torn my labor.</v>

3234
02:18:14.630 --> 02:18:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was like it was tightened up.</v>

3235
02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Just say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3236
02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:23.240
<v Speaker 2>there's all they have are like two </v>
<v Speaker 2>little scars because like,</v>

3237
02:18:23.300 --> 02:18:26.140
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was such an easy surgery that the day</v>

3238
02:18:26.141 --> 02:18:29.260
<v Speaker 2>of surgery it felt less bad than it did </v>
<v Speaker 2>the day before.</v>

3239
02:18:29.490 --> 02:18:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was like,</v>

3240
02:18:31.001 --> 02:18:33.030
<v Speaker 2>it was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the week that I turned 29.</v>

3241
02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:33.873
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's turned into an and already I'm </v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3243
02:18:36.701 --> 02:18:38.020
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>

3244
02:18:38.021 --> 02:18:38.561
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3245
02:18:38.561 --> 02:18:39.510

<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

3246
02:18:39.580 --> 02:18:42.670
<v Speaker 2>all of my surgeries have been on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure my parents dropped me as</v>

3247
02:18:42.671 --> 02:18:43.504
<v Speaker 2>a baby and just won't admit to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because my headache left side three </v>

<v Speaker 2>surgeries on my left shoulder surgery on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my left hip.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm right handed,</v>

3250
02:18:50.921 --> 02:18:52.980
<v Speaker 2>but I'm doing everything with your right</v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

3251
02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:53.893
<v Speaker 2>Left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>left side's atrophy kind of </v>

3252
02:18:54.641 --> 02:18:55.474
<v Speaker 2>ambidextrous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my friends is an archery </v>

3253
02:18:56.861 --> 02:18:59.560
<v Speaker 2>instructor and I'm learning how to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot bows and arrows,</v>

3254
02:18:59.561 --> 02:19:01.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just just in case the revolution come.</v>

3255
02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:02.103
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really,</v>

3256
02:19:02.170 --> 02:19:03.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3257
02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shoot with a,</v>

3258
02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:06.293
<v Speaker 2>my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my strong hand is my left hand and I'm </v>

3259
02:19:07.811 --> 02:19:11.590
<v Speaker 2>like my dominant on my left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pulled back on the wait,</v>

3260
02:19:11.591 --> 02:19:12.424
<v Speaker 2>which one gets back on the left and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left and pull back on the left and my </v>

<v Speaker 2>crazy and I have to keep explaining to </v>

3262

<v Speaker 2>slapping with this one need better form.</v>

3263
02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it keeps on going up.</v>

3264
02:19:28.700 --> 02:19:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you put one of those risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>things?</v>

02:19:30.580 --> 02:19:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Are they the forum thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have one and it's the worst.</v>

3266
02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:36.380
<v Speaker 2>This is the worst thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>because like all I have to do is go like</v>

3267
02:19:36.381 --> 02:19:37.214
<v Speaker 2>this to get my arm out of the way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead the couple of this is the worst </v>

3268
02:19:40.251 --> 02:19:43.460
<v Speaker 2>is when the string catches right here </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this giant bruise.</v>

3269

3270
02:19:46.401 --> 02:19:48.380
<v Speaker 2>bow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's along,</v>

3271
02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:50.870
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know off the top of the cams</v>
<v Speaker 2>in it,</v>

3272
02:19:50.871 --> 02:19:52.200

3276
02:19:56.270 --> 02:19:58.400
<v Speaker 2>she knows all the things we're doing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3277
02:19:58.401 --> 02:20:01.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kind of show from Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please let me not kill myself.</v>

02:20:48.110 --> 02:20:52.200
<v Speaker 2>that's like all of the unlike anger </v>
<v Speaker 2>daddy issues all the time,</v>

3305
02:20:52.210 --> 02:20:54.980
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't like why didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why didn't this work?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like the archery is just meditative.</v>

3308
02:20:59.510 --> 02:21:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Like it's relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're out in an open field.</v>

3309
02:21:02.841 --> 02:21:03.621
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's a really nice little archery range </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in Glendale.</v>

3313
02:21:08.251 --> 02:21:09.084
<v Speaker 1>where when you're doing it a requires so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much focus kind of drains you of </v>

3314
02:21:12.481 --> 02:21:13.210
<v Speaker 1>distractions.</v>

3315

<v Speaker 2>range,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I turn on a superhero soundtracks and </v>
