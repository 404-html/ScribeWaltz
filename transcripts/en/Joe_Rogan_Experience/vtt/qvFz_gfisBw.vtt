00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.420
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience if they were older.</v>

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.231
<v Speaker 1>The older I get,</v>

3
00:00:03.231 --> 00:00:05.150
<v Speaker 1>the more grading it becomes.</v>

4
00:00:05.151 --> 00:00:08.150
<v Speaker 1>When you realize you're being protected from destroying yourself,</v>

5
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.600
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

6
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.433
<v Speaker 1>stop it.</v>

7
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

8
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.060
<v Speaker 1>let me do this.</v>

9
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>If this is what I'm compelled to do.</v>

10
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:12.861
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:15.680
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's been proven that the things we're trying to prevent you</v>

12
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.120
<v Speaker 1>from doing aren't harmful.</v>

13
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes like pot,</v>

14
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.590
<v Speaker 1>just thinking about the money that's been spent on keeping pot illegal.</v>

15
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Of course everyone distrusts here now.</v>

16
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.310
<v Speaker 1>They're never going to listen to a God damn word.</v>

17
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:26.900
<v Speaker 1>He said he tried to keep pot from them.</v>

18
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>

19
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.620
<v Speaker 1>What's one of the dumbest things the government has ever done is try to keep pot</v>

20
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:31.090
<v Speaker 1>from people.</v>

21
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

22
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.380
<v Speaker 1>because you'd smoke it.</v>

23
00:00:33.381 --> 00:00:34.490
<v Speaker 1>You find out it's awesome.</v>

24
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.480
<v Speaker 1>You don't die.</v>

25
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>And then he started distrusting everything.</v>

26
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

27
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.990
<v Speaker 1>masturbation.</v>

29
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Think about how many people thought they were going to die from masturbation.</v>

30
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.171
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

31
00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

32
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.250
<v Speaker 1>you lose your mind.</v>

33
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 1>You get hair on your homes.</v>

34
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.680
<v Speaker 1>But when did that end?</v>

35
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.970
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't my time.</v>

36
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.361
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

37
00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:48.723
<v Speaker 1>a little slick.</v>

39
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

40
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.551
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

41
00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:49.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking,</v>

42
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about earlier at times,</v>

43
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.040
<v Speaker 1>early 20th century,</v>

44
00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:52.940
<v Speaker 1>19th century.</v>

45
00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:53.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

46
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I remember her that you were going to go blind or any,</v>

47
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.701
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

48
00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:56.001
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>

49
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Speaker 1>there are medical books in the 19th century.</v>

50
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Kellogg had this whole thing about it.</v>

51
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:00.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

53
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.851
<v Speaker 1>the causes,</v>

54
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:02.510
<v Speaker 1>insanity,</v>

55
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.343
<v Speaker 1>insanity.</v>

56
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 1>It causes hair to grow in your palms.</v>

57
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.643
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.693
<v Speaker 1>isn't that weird ability?</v>

59
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.820
<v Speaker 1>This Kellogg from Kellogg cereal,</v>

60
00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:11.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

61
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.523
<v Speaker 1>He had a thing.</v>

63
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>He was very,</v>

64
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.450
<v Speaker 1>you ever see that?</v>

65
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.030
<v Speaker 1>The road to Wellville people who masturbate,</v>

66
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.080
<v Speaker 1>he had a thing about that.</v>

67
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:20.570
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing with corn flakes,</v>

69
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.860
<v Speaker 1>the reason corn flakes were invented was to stop boys from masturbation.</v>

70
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.461
<v Speaker 1>How was that?</v>

71
00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:26.810
<v Speaker 1>How was the idea behind that?</v>

72
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:28.370
<v Speaker 1>We to explain this to us before,</v>

73
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.000
<v Speaker 1>and the idea is that spicy foods excite the sensibilities.</v>

74
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:34.270
<v Speaker 1>And so if you eat something that tastes interesting,</v>

75
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 1>you're going to want to come.</v>

76
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.110
<v Speaker 1>So they embed and also Graham crackers.</v>

77
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Graham was another of these big ante,</v>

78
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.190
<v Speaker 1>masturbation evangelizers.</v>

79
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:46.640
<v Speaker 1>So they invent these really intentionally bland foods.</v>

80
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.490
<v Speaker 1>They like to keep the teenage boys from jerking off so that when they finger,</v>

81
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:53.330
<v Speaker 1>they're assholes.</v>

82
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.053
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

83
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like veal.</v>

84
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Keep them in the dark.</v>

85
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.440
<v Speaker 1>So true.</v>

86
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.273
<v Speaker 1>Kellogg just take,</v>

87
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.570

00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:23.764
<v Speaker 1>That would be bad.</v>

96
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.870
<v Speaker 1>It can climb fences.</v>

97
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

102
00:02:35.861 --> 00:02:37.600
<v Speaker 1>I can just run through that fence anytime.</v>

103
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Split shitty wooden fences.</v>

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:41.620
<v Speaker 1>These keep cows in with.</v>

105
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Speaker 1>That's unbelievable.</v>

106
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.730
<v Speaker 1>It goes along the lines of what you're saying is just like,</v>

107
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.623
<v Speaker 1>you know there's all this,</v>

108
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.590
<v Speaker 1>these people who are conservative morals and stuff and they know,</v>

109
00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:51.460
<v Speaker 1>oh you shouldn't do this.</v>

111
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:52.481
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't do that.</v>

112
00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Because you've been told us over these years,</v>

113
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 1>but yet over the last century or so,</v>

114
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>most of those thoughts been debunked.</v>

115
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Meaning there's places where people allow what you're saying is evil.</v>

116
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>It's going to ruin society and a society is going to crumble.</v>

117
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>People allow this happen and it doesn't.</v>

118
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

119
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.490

121
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:16.150

122
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>He shouldn't do drugs.</v>

123
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.050
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't do all this shit cause it's gets the,</v>

124
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.470
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.140

131
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:34.760
<v Speaker 1>it's been proven that that will,</v>

132
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 1>suppression is not good for people that don't like it.</v>

133
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad way to raise children.</v>

134
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad way to raise a nation,</v>

135
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

136
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>It's just people don't like suppression.</v>

137
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 1>It's really that simple.</v>

138
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 1>They don't like it.</v>

139
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 1>They got upset.</v>

140
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you're another person and you're telling the guy what to do,</v>

141
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>telling the guy can't jerk off.</v>

142
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>What does that guy I want to do?</v>

143
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>He wants a jerk off.</v>

144
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>As soon as he gets away from you,</v>

145
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>he wants a boat doors and just jerk off and privacy and then feel terrible about</v>

146
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:57.880

147
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Mrs Kelli was fucking a personal trainer.</v>

202
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.690
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even have post personal trainers back then.</v>

203
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.280
<v Speaker 1>She invented,</v>

204
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.113
<v Speaker 1>invented it.</v>

205
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>She'd vented it just so that she could just have somebody touch me.</v>

206
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Did Jesus touch me on believable?</v>

207
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.161
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

208
00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:42.731
<v Speaker 1>that's people,</v>

209
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

210
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 1>People that are suppressing other people are usually doing it to try to suppress</v>

211
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:47.650
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

212
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Something in themselves.</v>

213
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Have you see a grizzly bear out in the fields and they're eating berries.</v>

214
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.920
<v Speaker 1>That bear might just look at Jugo.</v>

215
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

216
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.321
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

217
00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:55.061
<v Speaker 1>It's plenty of food.</v>

218
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 1>He's not hungry at all.</v>

219
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 1>So the build a bear has a belly full of berries and it's just sitting there</v>

220
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:00.104
<v Speaker 1>chewing along.</v>

221
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't give a fuck at all.</v>

222
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>But if a grizzly bear sees you and you're hungry,</v>

223
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.990
<v Speaker 1>is that the guy?</v>

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.110
