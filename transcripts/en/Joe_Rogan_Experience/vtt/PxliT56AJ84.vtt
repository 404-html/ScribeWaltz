00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.833
<v Speaker 1>One of the things,</v>

3
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.220
<v Speaker 2>about being,</v>

5
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:04.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.590
<v Speaker 2>a comic in Boston is that,</v>

7
00:00:06.591 --> 00:00:06.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

8
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.600
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of craft too.</v>

9
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>

10
00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:10.040
<v Speaker 2>you came along,</v>

11
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.490
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit after me about after uh,</v>

12
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.030
<v Speaker 2>my generation of open makers.</v>

13
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.750
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.830
<v Speaker 2>but there was a,</v>

15
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.630
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of emphasis put on the craft of like the use of the word fuck.</v>

16
00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

17
00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:22.850
<v Speaker 2>you could use the word fuck,</v>

18
00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:23.900
<v Speaker 2>but don't over fuck.</v>

19
00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 2>Don't break the fuck meter.</v>

20
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:26.060
<v Speaker 2>That's what you guys would say.</v>

21
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.601
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

22
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>I try to keep it to three,</v>

23
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>three to five fucks.</v>

24
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Like Donovan used to say it.</v>

26
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Donovan was a genius man.</v>

27
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Donovan Donovan is one of those,</v>

28
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.323
<v Speaker 2>the g</v>

29
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite lines ever is,</v>

30
00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about uh,</v>

31
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.420
<v Speaker 1>being at work and your boss breaking your balls about going on break.</v>

32
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.590
<v Speaker 1>And one of my favorite,</v>

33
00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:49.510
<v Speaker 1>like most one of those blue collar details that I never heard anybody bring up</v>

34
00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:50.140
<v Speaker 1>on stage.</v>

35
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>He was imitating given shit to his boss.</v>

36
00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:53.501
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

37
00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll take a 20 minute shit on the clock if I want.</v>

38
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.800
<v Speaker 1>And I was just like,</v>

39
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.521
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

40
00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I used to work with a guy who did that everyday just dogging it.</v>

41
00:01:01.631 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Just hated his life.</v>

42
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>He would grab the newspaper.</v>

43
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>It was just like he got,</v>

44
00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:06.670
<v Speaker 1>we just had a break.</v>

45
00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:07.720
<v Speaker 1>The Roach coach pulled up.</v>

46
00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>We just had the break and he used it to get,</v>

47
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.740
<v Speaker 1>he was so fucking miserable to get from the break to get to lunch.</v>

48
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.110
<v Speaker 1>He had this routine where he would go and he's like,</v>

49
00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:19.660
<v Speaker 1>I have to go to the bathroom and we would all break his balls.</v>

50
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.021
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

51
00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:20.221
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

52
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:20.541
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

53
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:22.360
<v Speaker 1>you fucking went in that like nine hours,</v>

54
00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

55
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.300
<v Speaker 1>And he would just laugh and he would just walk in,</v>

56
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.940
<v Speaker 1>sit down and just read the newspaper.</v>

57
00:01:27.941 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was taking his shit.</v>

58
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.650
<v Speaker 1>He would just sit on this bowl just to have this like,</v>

59
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I never forget that shit.</v>

60
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Like how lucky my life was to tell jokes.</v>

61
00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say that like your game plan is you ain't your job so bad that you</v>

62
00:01:39.341 --> 00:01:44.320
<v Speaker 1>pretend to take a shit but 20 minutes every day just to get to lunch.</v>

63
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of guys that can get fired for that.</v>

64
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

65
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:50.470
<v Speaker 1>now a days with all the cameras and everything.</v>

66
00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:53.260
<v Speaker 1>They can literally break down exactly when you cause back in the day that fuck</v>

67
00:01:53.261 --> 00:01:54.130
<v Speaker 1>he was six minutes.</v>

68
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

69
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.020
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't let me have a hernia.</v>

70
00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:57.220
<v Speaker 1>How quick am I supposed to take a shit?</v>

71
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.880
<v Speaker 2>They bring it to a diet counselor,</v>

72
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 2>tried to get you.</v>

73
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 2>We have to figure out,</v>

74
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:05.930
<v Speaker 2>figure out some sort of a way to optimize your time better here at performance</v>

75
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:06.460
<v Speaker 2>inc.</v>

76
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Setting</v>

77
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.760
<v Speaker 1>the people in the cubicles that you're walking by.</v>

78
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:09.660
<v Speaker 1>As you go to the,</v>

79
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:10.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>as you go to the toilet there,</v>

81
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:14.690
<v Speaker 1>they're pulling your load while you're shifting.</v>

82
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the dumbest things.</v>

83
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:16.591
<v Speaker 1>We have a dead.</v>

84
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:16.891
<v Speaker 1>We used to,</v>

85
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>we used to ship out like this computer software.</v>

86
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>We are the middleman between like software companies and people ordering</v>

87
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:23.761
<v Speaker 1>software.</v>

88
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:24.571
<v Speaker 1>This is like the 80,</v>

89
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>so there's no internet.</v>

90
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>So people would come to our company,</v>

91
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean the company I worked for where they had all this software at Lotus one,</v>

92
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:30.901
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

93
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:31.734
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

94
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.461
<v Speaker 1>Dbas,</v>

95
00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:32.701
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

96
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>all this old school shit.</v>

97
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

98
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>one day we got into this stupid guy,</v>

100
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>competitive thing like fucking morons.</v>

101
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:42.090
<v Speaker 1>We didn't realize it like who was shipping out the most.</v>

102
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>So we started saving them,</v>

103
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.410
<v Speaker 1>competing with one another and uh,</v>

104
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>this guy shipped out a hundred packages.</v>

105
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>So the next day I did one 20,</v>

106
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>and then he did one 60 move fighting and then the fucking management got room</v>

107
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:52.990
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

108
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.361
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

109
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:53.661
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

110
00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:56.240
<v Speaker 1>why don't you start keeping a,</v>

111
00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 1>an uh,</v>

112
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.381
<v Speaker 1>a number.</v>

113
00:02:57.381 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>And then they figured out who is being the most and guys started losing their</v>

114
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:00.911
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>

115
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>So I even back then I was like,</v>

116
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:02.790
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

117
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>stop fucking doing it.</v>

118
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Stop doing it because we're,</v>

119
00:03:05.911 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>we're literally cutting our own fucking,</v>

120
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.871
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

121
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>you're making yourself put yourself in a race that's,</v>

122
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:11.220
<v Speaker 1>there's no way.</v>

123
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know any better.</v>

124
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

125
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know any better idiots.</v>

126
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.940
<v Speaker 1>We like 1920 that we,</v>

127
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>we used to fucking go out and drink like a 12 pack of beer and eat McDonald's at</v>

128
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:21.431
<v Speaker 1>one in the morning.</v>

129
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>And by like eight o'clock we were unloading trucks,</v>

130
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.543
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

131
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>laughing and then we would work.</v>

132
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.783
<v Speaker 1>We do all this shit.</v>

133
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
<v Speaker 1>And then during lunch hour we would go out and play basketball and like just</v>

134
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 1>regular sneakers and like five o one blues member that the black and fly and</v>

135
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>you'd be that.</v>

136
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>You'd come back and pouring sweat and then just keep,</v>

137
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 1>unless it's the greatest shape I was ever in my life.</v>

138
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And then in the end of work I would then go lift and go ride a bike,</v>

139
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>do them at one time I want a bike ride hammered.</v>

140
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I was so into working out fucking bike ride.</v>

141
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm on like a 12 speed bike that I bought when I still have it,</v>

142
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:55.690

143
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.291
<v Speaker 1>am I garage,</v>

144
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>I refuse to throw shit out and a,</v>

145
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>I remember being hammered on the bike and I'm sweating so I'm becoming more</v>

146
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:02.554
<v Speaker 1>hammered.</v>

147
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>I was going to do this 11 mile loop.</v>

148
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Then it became oh seven and then I just kind of came back and I was like on the</v>

149
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:13.981
<v Speaker 1>bike laughing and I was like 2021 and was only beginning to understand the</v>

150
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 1>fragility of life.</v>

151
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>And I knew that what I was doing was stupid,</v>

152
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:18.784
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't get,</v>

153
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.200
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

154
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

155
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I just kept picturing my friends laughing at me and I was literally by myself</v>

156
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:23.651
<v Speaker 1>riding this bike,</v>

157
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 1>laughing drunk,</v>

158
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 1>driving up the street.</v>

159
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 1>And I'm in here for two and a half hours.</v>

160
00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm just taking snippets from fucking the eighties I got,</v>

161
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:33.424
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing left</v>

162
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 1>used to be able to bounce back.</v>

163
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:36.821
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

164
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:37.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

165
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 1>when you're young,</v>

166
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

167
00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 1>When you're 20 years old,</v>

168
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>you'd get hammered the next day.</v>

169
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>You barely feel anything.</v>

170
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.953
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

171
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Donald's and tear down that place.</v>

172
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 1>I would get to quarter pounders with cheese,</v>

173
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 1>a large fry,</v>

174
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 1>a six piece mcnugget and I never liked him.</v>

175
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I never liked him.</v>

176
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I never thought it an ice to try the different sauces.</v>

177
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I used to go with the mustard,</v>

178
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.200
<v Speaker 1>never tastes good.</v>

179
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted something to fill the void.</v>

180
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 1>And then I would get like a couple of cheeseburgers and uh,</v>

181
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it just a giant coke and just throw that down and wake up the next day</v>

182
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:08.590
<v Speaker 1>with a flat stomach.</v>

183
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 1>And I had already drank like,</v>

184
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.911
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

186
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:10.744
<v Speaker 1>nine beers.</v>

187
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.023
<v Speaker 1>We've got to fight.</v>

188
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.990
<v Speaker 1>We got into a fight one time right under the Golden Arches and the next town</v>

189
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:17.824
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

190
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.301
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened.</v>

191
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>These guys came in drunk,</v>

192
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>classic Boston shift.</v>

193
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>They just come walking in and they give everybody the finger.</v>

194
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Of course we respond to it and next thing you know we're out underneath the</v>

195
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:29.471
<v Speaker 1>golden arches.</v>

196
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 1>There's like five of us and two of them.</v>

197
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

198
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.551
<v Speaker 1>my buddy,</v>

199
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:34.151
<v Speaker 1>we always fought,</v>

200
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>he starts swinging on the big one and then the little one,</v>

201
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>he sort of jumped in and just became this big and it looked like wrestling,</v>

202
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:39.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>when like they all come running out of the dressing to help each other on snow.</v>

204
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's drunk just fallen down.</v>

205
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>We so fucking drunk.</v>

206
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 1>The cops were there like sort of misting mace for like,</v>

207
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know how long,</v>

208
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>like we didn't even see him pull up.</v>

209
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.300
<v Speaker 1>There's this that I like being in the flight.</v>

210
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden everybody's like,</v>

211
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>eyes are like up and shit.</v>

212
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.190
<v Speaker 1>And then what was hilarious was they just broke us up and they fuck it.</v>

213
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:07.410
<v Speaker 1>And then like two seconds later we're back in our car and the same two guys we</v>

214
00:06:07.411 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>were fighting come and back up to the car.</v>
