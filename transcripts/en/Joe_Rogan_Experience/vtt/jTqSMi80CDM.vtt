<v Speaker 1>I highly stressed.</v>

11
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>They can't take that.</v>

12
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.271
<v Speaker 1>They can't take that from,</v>

13
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm laying on top of it right now.</v>

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Bag of Oreos and,</v>

15
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>and my feet propped up on a,</v>

16
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>and a lovely lady.</v>

17
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Unless some Mike Tyson type character comes around.</v>

18
00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:36.794
<v Speaker 1>When did at 20,</v>

19
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>you got that shit locked up.</v>

20
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Don't really see that happening.</v>

21
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.921
<v Speaker 1>So weird,</v>

22
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:41.131
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

23
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>The heavyweight division is weird.</v>

24
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.661
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>ever since a lot of that drug testing came into play,</v>

26
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.990
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to see an 18 year old roll up into the UFC at over 200 and some</v>

27
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>odd pounds and to start laying into people.</v>

28
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it possible though,</v>

29
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>like one of those freak athletes that would normally make it into the NFL?</v>

30
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>It'd be He's got a dad that had been a martial arts instructor his whole life,</v>

31
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.883
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

32
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

33
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>I could see it.</v>

34
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

35
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>the poll is,</v>

36
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.283
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>if you could make it into the NFL,</v>

38
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.321
<v Speaker 1>you're almost,</v>

39
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>you're okay,</v>

40
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take all that money now and play in the NFL.</v>

41
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>And then if I feel like being a fighter,</v>

42
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that.</v>

43
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

44
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Like Hershel Walker did,</v>

45
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

46
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>like Hershel Walker did.</v>

47
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.451
<v Speaker 1>Although,</v>

48
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean he is a freak of freak of freaks.</v>

49
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

50
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>when you look at Herschel,</v>

51
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>he shouldn't be in the kind of shape he is at his age.</v>

52
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 1>And he says he eats like a bowl of soup and a salad every day and a snickers bar</v>

54
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:35.851
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

55
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>He's got some weird thing going on too though.</v>

57
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:42.030
<v Speaker 1>He has multiple personality disorder that's trauma induced.</v>

58
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe one of those personalities eats while the other one doesn't know about it.</v>

59
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>The other one's working out all the time.</v>

60
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 1>And so you're getting all your caloric needs from one guy and the other guys</v>

61
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>doing all the working out the other dude jerky off.</v>

62
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.843
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

63
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.331
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

64
00:01:56.331 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>then you have the one dude that does your taxes could be useful thing.</v>

65
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>It would definitely be useful thing for your mind.</v>

66
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>You compartmentalize like that,</v>

67
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>you could really pretend you don't jerk off and really pretend that you don't</v>

68
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Speaker 1>eat and you just have a bowl cell in the soup and you're fucking superman.</v>

69
00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:11.230
<v Speaker 1>I barely even have words.</v>

70
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.173
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>calluses from man.</v>

74

<v Speaker 2>And he still looks like he's like 30 so you're just,</v>

136
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

137
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Won The genetic lottery unless you have some sort of crazy radical genetic</v>

138
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 2>engineering down the pipe,</v>

139
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 2>which probably is going to happen,</v>

140
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:08.380
<v Speaker 2>whether it be lifetime maybe.</v>

141

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.340
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>

145
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to compete with some ridiculous freak athlete.</v>

146
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.081
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

147
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:22.081
<v Speaker 2>Mike is one of the most genetically gifted and a hardworking,</v>

148
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 2>of course to people I have ever seen.</v>

149
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 2>He also has a world record for running through plate glass windows.</v>

150
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.030
<v Speaker 2>I know that.</v>

151
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 2>I felt like,</v>

152
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.881
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

153
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:31.341
<v Speaker 2>no shit.</v>

154
00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:33.000
<v Speaker 2>He does right that race.</v>

155
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 2>But I know you win football gear and a helmet and they line up these plate glass</v>

156
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 2>windows and this huge long line,</v>

157
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 2>this light like a,</v>

158
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.320
<v Speaker 2>a two two line or three line deal,</v>

159
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.203
<v Speaker 2>Domino's.</v>

160
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.691
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

161
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:46.751
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

162
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

163
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Each one is individually set up and he smashes through the first,</v>

164
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:51.231
<v Speaker 2>the second.</v>

165
00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 2>And you need to keeps going,</v>

166
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:52.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

167
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:53.540
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes you run into them,</v>

168
00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 2>it bounces you back and you just gotta keep driving.</v>

169
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

170
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 2>He's also got a black belt in judo.</v>

171
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ on the American gladiators.</v>

172
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:01.331
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

173
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:02.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

174
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 2>he was on battle dome,</v>

175
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 2>Battle Dome,</v>

176
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.643
<v Speaker 2>Battle Dome,</v>

177
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 2>a kind of remember that?</v>

178
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

179
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 2>it was battle dome again.</v>

180
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Think lower rent,</v>

181
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 2>American gladiators.</v>

182
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 2>It was meaner and people got hurt more.</v>

183
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.170
<v Speaker 2>That's running.</v>

184
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Everybody had a very obnoxious or ostentatious,</v>

185
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 2>like very gregarious character,</v>

186
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 2>very over the top.</v>

187
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 2>And so he was Mike Odell,</v>

188
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 2>like the perfect Greek God,</v>

189
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.800
<v Speaker 2>although come on,</v>

190
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 2>that's not very Greek.</v>

191
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.270
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

192
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.691
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>

193
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:28.841
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

194
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:29.950
<v Speaker 2>you know who also it was on,</v>

195
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:30.850
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

196
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.291
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

197
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:32.921
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember his name.</v>

198
00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:34.270
<v Speaker 2>He played in the NFL.</v>

199
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 2>He's incredibly funny.</v>

200
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.173
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

201
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.223
<v Speaker 2>Terry crews.</v>

202
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Terry crews is on battle dome.</v>

203
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.301
<v Speaker 2>Was He really?</v>

204
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:40.451
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

205
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

206
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.561
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

207
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 2>And then there was another guy,</v>

208
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Eric Paulson used to train them and Eric even did the psycho Guy Gimmick,</v>

209
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 2>the Hannibal Lecter deal.</v>

210
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.180
<v Speaker 2>And they had an event on there where you'd have to get a guy off this platform</v>

211
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.253
<v Speaker 2>over the lines.</v>

212
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 2>And Eric used to just murder everybody in that event.</v>

213
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 2>And then one of our guys who fights,</v>

214
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 2>who is one of our CSW dudes,</v>

215
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:08.060
<v Speaker 2>he actually went on to battle dome at one point,</v>

216
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

217
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.470
<v Speaker 2>j Martinez way back in the day and he wrecked all the dudes that he saw.</v>

218
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Aunt who got,</v>

219
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 2>he got onto the platform that get the push out.</v>

220
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.860
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

221
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 2>he just fucked him all up and they were so,</v>

222
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 2>they hated him so bad because there was like another event where it was football</v>

223
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:25.094
<v Speaker 2>ask,</v>

224
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

225
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Terry Cruz and Mike would just practically take people's heads completely off</v>

226
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:30.171
<v Speaker 2>their body.</v>

227
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

228
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 2>it was really bad.</v>

229
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.271
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised.</v>

230
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 2>And when they redid that,</v>

231
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 2>they redid a,</v>

232
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.841
<v Speaker 3>not this one,</v>

233
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 3>but the other one.</v>

234
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.423
<v Speaker 3>Gladiators.</v>

235
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't that take off?</v>

236
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 3>It seems like that would take off.</v>

237
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 3>They'd haul Kogan Laila Ali.</v>

238
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Gina Carano was one of the ass kickers.</v>

239
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:47.840
<v Speaker 3>What channel was that though during the writers strike?</v>

240
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.970
<v Speaker 3>Was it during the writer's strike?</v>

241
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.833
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>

242
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 3>But it's still a reality show.</v>

243
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 3>Like those that seems like it would be an easy one to do.</v>

244
00:06:56.331 --> 00:06:57.130
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>

245
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 3>you know that a wipe out is kind of similar.</v>

246
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:00.500
<v Speaker 3>But no one kicks your ass.</v>

247
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

248
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.230
<v Speaker 3>And now people love that American Ninja Warrior.</v>

249
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

250
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

251
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.040
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

252
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

253
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I didn't actually continue as well.</v>

254
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:07.191
<v Speaker 2>I figured,</v>

255
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:07.371
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

256
00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:11.200
<v Speaker 2>you know it has a little bit of distance in it and two seasons and that shit was</v>

257
00:07:11.201 --> 00:07:11.280
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

258
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.113
<v Speaker 3>done?</v>

259
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.911
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

260
00:07:12.911 --> 00:07:15.550
<v Speaker 3>whenever you have like people that you have hired,</v>

261
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 3>like you hire a Josh Barnett and you,</v>

262
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:20.800
<v Speaker 3>you have to smash some dude who's competing.</v>

263
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.660
<v Speaker 3>It gets kind of weird.</v>

264
00:07:22.661 --> 00:07:23.494
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's not,</v>

265
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.210
<v Speaker 3>not really,</v>

266
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.140
<v Speaker 3>you're not competing against another person.</v>

267
00:07:26.141 --> 00:07:28.950
<v Speaker 3>You competing against a hired guy who's does not.</v>

268
00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:29.500
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

269
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.580
<v Speaker 3>if the guy gets hurt,</v>

270
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.160
<v Speaker 3>if someone gets hurt and like you heard them,</v>

271
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:38.550
<v Speaker 3>like I could be pretty easy to sue the company that makes that show.</v>

272
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.270
<v Speaker 3>Like you're an employee.</v>

273
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:41.021
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

274
00:07:41.021 --> 00:07:43.930
<v Speaker 3>if you know some dude makes it run at you and you fucking clothesline him and</v>

275
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:44.764
<v Speaker 3>he's paralyzed,</v>

276
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.150
<v Speaker 3>he have a waivers man.</v>

277
00:07:46.151 --> 00:07:48.460
<v Speaker 3>They fight those things and when you fight them,</v>

278
00:07:48.461 --> 00:07:48.910
<v Speaker 3>if a,</v>

279
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.040
<v Speaker 3>if a lawsuit is strong enough,</v>

280
00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:52.420
<v Speaker 3>it's got enough power behind it,</v>

281
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.280
<v Speaker 3>enough legal power behind it.</v>

282
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.350
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that was it or probably not.</v>

283
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.540
<v Speaker 3>It's probably just writing.</v>

284
00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:58.810
<v Speaker 3>So I think it was just ratings.</v>

285
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.220
<v Speaker 3>I think it was just ratings.</v>

286
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.230
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting when you think about what guys are capable of like physically</v>

287
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.650
<v Speaker 3>with the maximizing your genetic potential.</v>

288
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.540
<v Speaker 3>Like there's certain,</v>

289
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.710
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain level that you can't get past and it's one of the reasons like</v>

290
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.430
<v Speaker 3>when everyone talks about like steroids and performance enhancing drugs and</v>

291
00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:21.040
<v Speaker 3>what's what's fair and what's not fair.</v>

294
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:25.370
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

295
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.190
<v Speaker 3>It not fair at all.</v>

301
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

302
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.590
<v Speaker 2>the proverbial gene pool has been pissed and you know,</v>

303
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.280
<v Speaker 2>get born with stubby fingers or you know,</v>

304
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:45.070
<v Speaker 2>half a leg like down syndrome like well good luck because you how that works.</v>

305
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:45.781
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

306
00:08:45.781 --> 00:08:47.040
<v Speaker 3>And if you're an athlete,</v>

307
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.240
<v Speaker 3>no matter what you do,</v>

308
00:08:48.241 --> 00:08:49.580
<v Speaker 3>like there's certain guys you just,</v>

309
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

310
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.270
<v Speaker 3>the Hershel Walker's to certain types of dudes that just are always going to</v>

311
00:08:54.271 --> 00:08:55.650
<v Speaker 3>have that advantage.</v>

312
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 3>What</v>

313
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

314
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Herschel was a fan.</v>

315
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 2>He was a really well versed,</v>

316
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

317
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:01.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

318
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:03.390
<v Speaker 2>he had a good career in the NFL,</v>

319
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:08.391
<v Speaker 2>but he never was the guy more than anyone else.</v>

320
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:08.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

321
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:09.210
<v Speaker 2>he had all,</v>

322
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

323
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 2>he had some years where he,</v>

324
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.600
<v Speaker 2>and you always knew he was solid,</v>

325
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 2>but he never was the top dude.</v>

326
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.501
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

327
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:16.981
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

328
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:17.101
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

329
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:18.660
<v Speaker 2>he was never the number one guy.</v>

330
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 2>And often towards,</v>

331
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.820
<v Speaker 2>later on in his career,</v>

332
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 2>he was usually the backup guy or the dude who got brought in for all the,</v>

333
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:26.090
<v Speaker 2>all purpose yardage or a well,</v>

334
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.620
<v Speaker 2>because Herschel could run and catch and possibly,</v>

335
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.850
<v Speaker 2>I bet you if you throw the ball to him,</v>

336
00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:30.684
<v Speaker 2>he could,</v>

337
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:31.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

338
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 2>he could throw a pass down field.</v>

339
00:09:32.941 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

340
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 2>He could probably play defense event.</v>

341
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:35.820
<v Speaker 2>It's just right.</v>

342
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:40.821
<v Speaker 2>And then they would do those NFL a off season competition things.</v>

343
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.640
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

344
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Or they take all these different players,</v>

345
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:43.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

346
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.400
<v Speaker 2>on NBC or something and they would all compete against each other and little</v>

347
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:48.230
<v Speaker 2>events,</v>

348
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

349
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:53.870
<v Speaker 2>throwing the football through through hoops and through tires and a sumo in the</v>

350
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:55.471
<v Speaker 2>beach,</v>

351
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:55.891
<v Speaker 2>sand,</v>

352
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:56.730
<v Speaker 2>all this different stuff.</v>

353
00:09:56.731 --> 00:09:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Right of the network stars like that kind of thing.</v>

354
00:09:59.941 --> 00:10:01.470
<v Speaker 2>But just for NFL players,</v>

355
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 2>the NFL would do it and Herschel Walker won every single one of them.</v>

356
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.020
<v Speaker 2>He was delay every time,</v>

357
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.590
<v Speaker 2>but he was not the best running back in the NFL during his entire career.</v>

358
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.690
<v Speaker 2>He was not the best fullback he would,</v>

359
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.660
<v Speaker 2>but he could play full back running back quarterback.</v>

360
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.580
<v Speaker 2>He didn't get fucked up either.</v>

361
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:26.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like Bo Jackson's out there crushing everybody eating yards up.</v>

362
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:27.481
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

363
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:28.930
<v Speaker 2>His hip goes out right.</v>

364
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Or a Steve it and taking uh,</v>

365
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.690
<v Speaker 2>interceptions and running them back 90 some yards as a defensive tackle or dnd</v>

366
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:37.531
<v Speaker 2>and boom,</v>

367
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:38.460
<v Speaker 2>his need gets blown out.</v>

368
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:38.941
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

369
00:10:38.941 --> 00:10:39.774
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

370
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Not Herschel Walker,</v>

371
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.150
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't get hurt.</v>

372
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

373
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.291
<v Speaker 2>Was Weird,</v>

374
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:43.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

375
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:43.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

376
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:44.161
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

377
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:44.911
<v Speaker 2>he's a specimen,</v>

378
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:45.780
<v Speaker 2>but he never was,</v>

379
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:46.171
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

380
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:47.970
<v Speaker 2>he was never the number one guy.</v>

381
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.833
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

382
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.880
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that thing recently about Jeremy Horn?</v>

383
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Horn said zero injuries are 117 fights or something.</v>

384
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.180
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

385
00:10:57.181 --> 00:10:57.991
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

386
00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:01.620
<v Speaker 2>He must be made out of fucking flubber rubber maid or whatever.</v>

387
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:01.771
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

388
00:11:01.771 --> 00:11:02.940
<v Speaker 2>he just bounces back out.</v>

389
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:03.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

390
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:04.314
<v Speaker 2>They call them gumby.</v>

391
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.610
<v Speaker 2>That's always been his nickname.</v>

392
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.050
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

393
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

394
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.350
<v Speaker 2>he just says it just focuses only on technique and he's never been a strong guy.</v>

395
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

396
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:11.760
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

397
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.280
<v Speaker 2>he's got a point and it's something that I've stressed a lot,</v>

398
00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:14.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

399
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:19.910
<v Speaker 2>when we talk about fighting and that is so many guys have learned how to be</v>

400
00:11:20.671 --> 00:11:24.840
<v Speaker 2>stronger and faster with or without drugs and learn how to defend certain</v>

401
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:25.591
<v Speaker 2>positions and,</v>

402
00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:26.100
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

403
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.000
<v Speaker 2>and hit hard,</v>

404
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.300
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have a full well rounded skill set.</v>

405
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.860
<v Speaker 2>They've all got these plan A's and no plan and their plan B sucks and their</v>

406
00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.600
<v Speaker 2>plants c isn't even a thing.</v>

407
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.970
<v Speaker 2>And then when they slowed down a step,</v>

408
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.530
<v Speaker 2>they lose a little bit.</v>

409
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.670
<v Speaker 2>They come up across the guy who's either stronger and faster or just a little</v>

410
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:45.720
<v Speaker 2>better striker or too,</v>

411
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:46.640
<v Speaker 2>too good of a,</v>

412
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 2>too good at something that will just derail their plan a,</v>

413
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.130
<v Speaker 2>they start losing when they start losing,</v>

414
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 2>they just nosedive.</v>

415
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.370
<v Speaker 2>They lose four or five,</v>

416
00:11:55.371 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 2>it's five fights.</v>

417
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.150
<v Speaker 2>These guys that would go out there and mop these dudes up.</v>

418
00:11:58.151 --> 00:11:58.421
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

419
00:11:58.421 --> 00:11:58.751
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

420
00:11:58.751 --> 00:11:59.081
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

421
00:11:59.081 --> 00:11:59.411
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

422
00:11:59.411 --> 00:11:59.741
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

423
00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:00.011
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

424
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:00.844
<v Speaker 2>turns a corner.</v>

425
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.780
<v Speaker 2>They can't sustain a career because they have no technique.</v>

426
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 2>They do not have the finesse,</v>

427
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.141
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

428
00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:08.711
<v Speaker 2>the touch,</v>

429
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:09.544
<v Speaker 2>the feel.</v>

430
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.503
<v Speaker 2>They don't own it.</v>

431
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.130
<v Speaker 2>They never developed it.</v>

432
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.750
<v Speaker 2>They just became really strong,</v>

433
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:14.471
<v Speaker 2>really fast.</v>

434
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Hit Hard,</v>

435
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.600
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmed out athlete,</v>

436
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 2>their opponent.</v>

437
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.430
<v Speaker 2>What'd you call a front runner?</v>

438
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.960
<v Speaker 2>A yes.</v>

439
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:21.243
<v Speaker 2>For the most part.</v>

440
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:21.941
<v Speaker 2>And Watch,</v>

441
00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:22.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

442
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:22.321
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

443
00:12:22.321 --> 00:12:23.770
<v Speaker 2>you watch these fights and how you all,</v>

444
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:23.951
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

445
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 2>this fight's going to be so good.</v>

446
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.880
<v Speaker 2>And then it's whoever's gets out first.</v>

447
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh that guy wins whoever's game.</v>

448
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Whoever's plan a starts first wins a fight.</v>

449
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.210
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting when you look at MMA too,</v>

450
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 3>it's so few guys or what you would call durable.</v>

451
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

452
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:41.251
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

453
00:12:41.251 --> 00:12:42.620
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to like,</v>

454
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:46.870
<v Speaker 3>like when you see like Steve Bay meo chick versus a junior dos Santos.</v>

455
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:47.081
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

456
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:49.960
<v Speaker 3>If one of those crazy fucking five round wars,</v>

457
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.140
<v Speaker 3>there's so few guys that can engage in those kinds of wars and,</v>

458
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.441
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

459
00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:54.741
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

460
00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:55.574
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

461
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.680
<v Speaker 3>and make it out of there.</v>

462
00:12:56.681 --> 00:12:57.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

463
00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

464
00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.371
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

465
00:12:58.371 --> 00:12:59.600
<v Speaker 2>And honestly,</v>

466
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:00.830
<v Speaker 2>especially as a heavyweight,</v>

467
00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.813
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

468
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.920
<v Speaker 2>with all that power and strength,</v>

469
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:05.810
<v Speaker 2>you go through that,</v>

470
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.500
<v Speaker 2>what's your next fight going to be like and your next one and the next one and</v>

471
00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.560
<v Speaker 2>how many of those you really want to get involved in?</v>

472
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:11.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

473
00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:15.510
<v Speaker 3>Like when you see a guy like Jr and you see those wars that he had with Cain and</v>

474
00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:15.781
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

475
00:13:15.781 --> 00:13:17.100
<v Speaker 3>you knowing your,</v>

476
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've had a long career man.</v>

477
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.500
<v Speaker 3>You knowing like the toll that a fight like that takes on your body.</v>

478
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.300
<v Speaker 3>Do you see him diminished at all?</v>

479
00:13:24.301 --> 00:13:25.750
<v Speaker 3>Do you see him slowed down?</v>

480
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:26.110
<v Speaker 3>He's</v>

481
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.600
<v Speaker 2>a step.</v>

482
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.433
<v Speaker 2>He's a step slower.</v>

483
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Junior is a step slower.</v>

484
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:30.700
<v Speaker 2>He's not quite as durable.</v>

485
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:33.340
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't react the same way to getting hit as he used to.</v>

486
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.623
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

487
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:35.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

488
00:13:35.801 --> 00:13:37.200
<v Speaker 2>know and,</v>

489
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.080
<v Speaker 2>and here's the thing,</v>

490
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.760
<v Speaker 2>someone might get on Twitter after this and go,</v>

491
00:13:40.761 --> 00:13:41.320
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

492
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:41.901
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett,</v>

493
00:13:41.901 --> 00:13:44.080
<v Speaker 2>it says that you're not as good as you used to be junior.</v>

494
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:44.471
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

495
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:44.791
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

496
00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:45.760
<v Speaker 2>that's not an insult.</v>

497
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm it.</v>

498
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 2>What it's saying is that you're the,</v>

499
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:54.820
<v Speaker 2>what do you have been through what you have done through to yourself and trading</v>

500
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:59.260
<v Speaker 2>and what your body is and isn't willing to accept or isn't willing to or is able</v>

501
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:00.094
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

502
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Just buying the natural string of how things went in terms of your career to</v>

503
00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:05.074
<v Speaker 2>this point.</v>

504
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.310
<v Speaker 2>This is what it is.</v>

505
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Take what you have now and adapt it.</v>

506
00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:12.370
<v Speaker 2>It's in the end.</v>

507
00:14:12.371 --> 00:14:16.300
<v Speaker 2>It's really only it's up to you to to decide whether or not what you're going to</v>

508
00:14:16.301 --> 00:14:17.560
<v Speaker 2>do is going to be successful.</v>

509
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.030
<v Speaker 2>If you could only,</v>

510
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:19.381
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

511
00:14:19.381 --> 00:14:23.050
<v Speaker 2>you're so set in your mind that it can only be done one way then when that way</v>

512
00:14:23.051 --> 00:14:23.801
<v Speaker 2>is no longer,</v>

513
00:14:23.801 --> 00:14:26.200
<v Speaker 2>what is best for you to do as an athlete.</v>

514
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Prepare to have the shit kicked out of you.</v>

515
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.093
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

516
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.140
<v Speaker 2>if you're willing to adapt,</v>

517
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.920
<v Speaker 2>reapply the things that you've already done well at some new things in.</v>

518
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Just do them a little differently.</v>

519
00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Make small changes.</v>

520
00:14:38.291 --> 00:14:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Well then now you can go ahead and you can have 19 years of career instead of</v>

521
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.060
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

522
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

523
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.553
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

524
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.633
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

525
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.540
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make,</v>

526
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:47.021
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't.</v>

527
00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:50.500
<v Speaker 2>If you could run out there and double leg everybody in the beginning but now you</v>

528
00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:51.410
<v Speaker 2>can't do that anymore.</v>

529
00:14:51.411 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 2>But instead you were able to set your double leg up.</v>

530
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Just makes people react,</v>

531
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.060
<v Speaker 2>hit him on the way up or hit him and then get a body lock and finish that way.</v>

532
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.300
<v Speaker 2>How has that any fucking worse than what you were doing before?</v>

533
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.200
<v Speaker 2>Just because you didn't do it how you used to but you're still getting to where</v>

534
00:15:06.201 --> 00:15:07.034
<v Speaker 2>you want to be.</v>

535
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.960
<v Speaker 2>To me that's still success.</v>

536
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.890
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting situation where you see there's some guys that still have</v>

537
00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:15.020
<v Speaker 2>like a single minded pursuit,</v>

538
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.970
<v Speaker 2>single minded skillset,</v>

539
00:15:16.971 --> 00:15:18.800
<v Speaker 2>like they just want to wrestle and box.</v>

540
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:19.131
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

541
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:20.360
<v Speaker 2>They never throw leg kicks.</v>

542
00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:20.991
<v Speaker 2>They never,</v>

543
00:15:20.991 --> 00:15:24.710
<v Speaker 2>and those guys are going to get their fucking shit pushed in once they come over</v>

544
00:15:24.711 --> 00:15:25.000
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

545
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.240
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

546
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.330
<v Speaker 2>that magic every line.</v>

547
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 2>You don't know when that's going to be,</v>

548
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.180
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to happen and then they're going to fucking nosedive.</v>

549
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.050
<v Speaker 2>There are going to be washed up has beens.</v>

550
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.800
<v Speaker 2>So it seems like in this day and age especially,</v>

551
00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:37.634
<v Speaker 2>you kinda like,</v>

552
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:37.971
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

553
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:39.200
<v Speaker 2>like it's certain divisions,</v>

554
00:15:39.201 --> 00:15:41.640
<v Speaker 2>like there's certain divisions like say if you want to fight flyway,</v>

555
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.100
<v Speaker 2>you better be able to do everything.</v>

556
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:43.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

557
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.200
<v Speaker 2>mighty mouse is just so God damn good.</v>

558
00:15:45.201 --> 00:15:45.951
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to fight that guy.</v>

559
00:15:45.951 --> 00:15:47.120
<v Speaker 2>You better be able to do everything.</v>

560
00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:47.954
<v Speaker 2>And he's a rarity.</v>

561
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Most guys are not going to be him.</v>

562
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:50.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

563
00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.170
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>

564
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.280
<v Speaker 2>I've known DJ since he was just this kid up at the gym who is too small to</v>

565
00:15:57.501 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 2>really get any fights in a way class that he really belongs in.</v>

566
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.393
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

567
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.130
<v Speaker 2>he trained diligently over,</v>

568
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:06.260
<v Speaker 2>even when he knew he wasn't going to get fights,</v>

569
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.980
<v Speaker 2>he was in the gym day after day training and training and training,</v>

570
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:10.491
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

571
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:11.181
<v Speaker 2>hard training,</v>

572
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:12.470
<v Speaker 2>easy training,</v>

573
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.520
<v Speaker 2>fast training,</v>

574
00:16:13.521 --> 00:16:14.660
<v Speaker 2>slow training,</v>

575
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.900
<v Speaker 2>and doing what Matt had told him that he needed to do.</v>

576
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.600
<v Speaker 2>And that's why he is the way he is now.</v>

577
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

578
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.580
<v Speaker 2>when I trained under Matt,</v>

579
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.260
<v Speaker 2>I did the same thing.</v>

580
00:16:24.261 --> 00:16:25.340
<v Speaker 2>I trained constantly.</v>

581
00:16:25.341 --> 00:16:26.840
<v Speaker 2>I trained when Matt wasn't around,</v>

582
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.700
<v Speaker 2>when it was my own free time.</v>

583
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.830
<v Speaker 2>I spent that going over what we,</v>

584
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.030
<v Speaker 2>what was working,</v>

585
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.901
<v Speaker 2>what wasn't working,</v>

586
00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:33.740
<v Speaker 2>why was this working,</v>

587
00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:34.760
<v Speaker 2>why wasn't this working?</v>

588
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.350
<v Speaker 2>How can I make these better,</v>

589
00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:37.523
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

590
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.180
<v Speaker 2>shadowboxing,</v>

591
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:38.991
<v Speaker 2>figuring things out,</v>

592
00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:40.270
<v Speaker 2>altering and,</v>

593
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.290
<v Speaker 2>and the things that Matt would say,</v>

594
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:42.501
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

595
00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:43.580
<v Speaker 2>I need you to do this.</v>

596
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

597
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't really understand why or what can you explain it to me?</v>

598
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

599
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.490
<v Speaker 2>because I need you to do this so that you can do this.</v>

600
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.211
<v Speaker 2>Create,</v>

601
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:54.230
<v Speaker 2>elicit this reaction,</v>

602
00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.093
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

603
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

604
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 2>I still don't get it,</v>

605
00:16:56.571 --> 00:16:58.130
<v Speaker 2>but I know what you want,</v>

606
00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.290
<v Speaker 2>where this is supposed to lead to.</v>

607
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll figure it out.</v>

608
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.970
<v Speaker 2>I will play with it and play with it and play with it and play with it.</v>

609
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Not talking about my cock,</v>

610
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.620
<v Speaker 2>but in addition to that,</v>

611
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.890
<v Speaker 2>I will keep playing with it until it makes sense to me.</v>

612
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:18.310
<v Speaker 2>And then I can come back and now I can ask a question that has purpose to it and</v>

613
00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 2>instead of just,</v>

614
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:20.563
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

615
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Of course you don't get it.</v>

616
00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.180
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get it.</v>

617
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.811
<v Speaker 2>Lots of things.</v>

618
00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:27.860
<v Speaker 2>You're just not going to get the first time until you live in it until you wrap</v>

619
00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:28.430
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

620
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.370
<v Speaker 2>wrap it around you like a skin and understand it.</v>

621
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.573
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

622
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.280
<v Speaker 2>and then you might even make a decision to go,</v>

623
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.130
<v Speaker 2>what you want me to accomplish with this.</v>

624
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.550
<v Speaker 2>It isn't that effective for me to do it this way,</v>

625
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.870
<v Speaker 2>but if I just make a little change to it because of the way I'm built,</v>

626
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.090
<v Speaker 2>because of my own natural tendencies,</v>

627
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.553
<v Speaker 2>what have you,</v>

628
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.363
<v Speaker 2>I can get that.</v>

629
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.700
<v Speaker 2>I can get what you want and,</v>

630
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:52.500
<v Speaker 2>and do it,</v>

631
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.260
<v Speaker 2>do what you want and till the weekend end of that end point,</v>

632
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:56.094
<v Speaker 2>we can get there.</v>

633
00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:56.790
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

634
00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.690
<v Speaker 2>but you can't understand that until you've taken the time to make that thing</v>

635
00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:02.010
<v Speaker 2>yours to fully understand it.</v>

636
00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:02.940
<v Speaker 2>And there's some things,</v>

637
00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:03.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

638
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.900
<v Speaker 2>something take techniques of Matt that he's shown me over the years that I can</v>

639
00:18:06.901 --> 00:18:09.240
<v Speaker 2>teach others I can't pull off or the shit,</v>

640
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.830
<v Speaker 2>it's just not my move.</v>

641
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really built for it.</v>

642
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.920
<v Speaker 2>He was built for it in May.</v>

643
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:14.850
<v Speaker 2>He made it work better.</v>

644
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.110
<v Speaker 2>And the same was with Paulson,</v>

645
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:16.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

646
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:17.190
<v Speaker 2>just sitting there and,</v>

647
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:22.320
<v Speaker 2>and taking all this information in and understanding and pulses backgrounds even</v>

648
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:23.520
<v Speaker 2>more varied than that.</v>

649
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.780
<v Speaker 2>So he'll come at me and go,</v>

650
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:25.051
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

651
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:25.201
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

652
00:18:25.201 --> 00:18:25.660
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>

653
00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

654
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.710
<v Speaker 2>that's really from left field.</v>

655
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:30.383
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

656
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.540
<v Speaker 2>but there's a reason I'll figure it out.</v>

657
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:34.703
<v Speaker 2>I'll figure that out.</v>

658
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Is that one of the more frustrating things about being an MMA fighter when you</v>

659
00:18:38.191 --> 00:18:41.430
<v Speaker 1>tried to talk to people that don't know fighting is,</v>

660
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.900
<v Speaker 1>there's so much complexity and so much technique involved and the person on the</v>

661
00:18:45.901 --> 00:18:46.411
<v Speaker 1>outside,</v>

662
00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:49.560
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be like a brute sport involving strength and weight.</v>

663
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.300
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and it does involve those things.</v>

664
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

665
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:54.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

666
00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.313
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>

667
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Aliens.</v>

668
00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.570
<v Speaker 1>But it's not take,</v>

669
00:18:59.220 --> 00:18:59.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

670
00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.583
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

671
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.960
<v Speaker 1>We've had alarm issues in this fucking building.</v>

672
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.311
<v Speaker 1>I heard,</v>

673
00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:04.971
<v Speaker 1>I saw him.</v>

674
00:19:04.971 --> 00:19:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I'll try and get in.</v>

675
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I had to fight my way through the front to the front that you made it through,</v>

676
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:08.410
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

677
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>

678
00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:09.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

679
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.320
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people don't understand how many different techniques are involved are,</v>

680
00:19:13.321 --> 00:19:13.850
<v Speaker 1>and how much,</v>

681
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:15.830
<v Speaker 1>how many variables are involved in training.</v>

682
00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:21.060
<v Speaker 2>I can't be too angry at the ignorance of the casual fan.</v>

683
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:27.030
<v Speaker 2>It's not their job to be that first the fan that that does go that extra mile</v>

684
00:19:28.391 --> 00:19:29.590
<v Speaker 2>and learn about the history,</v>

685
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.370
<v Speaker 2>learn about why this technique would work and who these people are and where</v>

686
00:19:33.371 --> 00:19:35.200
<v Speaker 2>they come from and what this is and what that is.</v>

687
00:19:35.201 --> 00:19:39.340
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome and amazing and I really appreciate that.</v>

688
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:44.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't begrudge the person that doesn't,</v>

689
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it when they say really ignorant,</v>

690
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.000
<v Speaker 2>mean spirited stuff.</v>

691
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:49.721
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

692
00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:50.050
<v Speaker 2>When there,</v>

693
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:51.510
<v Speaker 2>but that's a different thing altogether.</v>

694
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.530
<v Speaker 2>That's somebody trying to,</v>

695
00:19:52.531 --> 00:19:52.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

696
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.860
<v Speaker 1>be a dick on purpose to try and cut somebody else down that that's a whole</v>

697
00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:56.694
<v Speaker 1>different animal,</v>

698
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.380
<v Speaker 1>but just not understanding.</v>

699
00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.573
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

700
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.960
<v Speaker 1>I personally,</v>

701
00:20:00.961 --> 00:20:01.980
<v Speaker 1>when I get into something,</v>

702
00:20:01.981 --> 00:20:03.390
<v Speaker 1>I do want to fully understand it,</v>

703
00:20:03.391 --> 00:20:05.850
<v Speaker 1>but that's just the kind of person that I don't even mean people that are into</v>

704
00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:05.971
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

705
00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean the casual person that is not aware of them.</v>

706
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.091
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

707
00:20:09.091 --> 00:20:09.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

708
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating thing that so many people,</v>

709
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:12.983
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

710
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:13.853
<v Speaker 1>that person</v>

711
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.753
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

712
00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.820
<v Speaker 2>you know what it could be anything.</v>

713
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.110
<v Speaker 2>And fighting is,</v>

714
00:20:19.111 --> 00:20:23.770
<v Speaker 2>while it is something that is available and exists within every human being,</v>

715
00:20:23.771 --> 00:20:24.050
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

716
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Ability to fight,</v>

717
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.270
<v Speaker 1>everybody has the ability to fight.</v>

718
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Never Seen Brian fight.</v>

719
00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:28.573
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

720
00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:29.541
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say fight.</v>

721
00:20:29.541 --> 00:20:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Well he doesn't even have the ability.</v>

722
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.000
<v Speaker 1>He just starts falling down.</v>

723
00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

724
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.250
<v Speaker 1>I just tried to kiss you or something.</v>

725
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Just make it really awkward.</v>

726
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:40.221
<v Speaker 1>Awkward.</v>

727
00:20:40.221 --> 00:20:43.130
<v Speaker 1>So you just want to leave it open so you don't want to punch his tongue.</v>

728
00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

729
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Just hold on to your belt loops and just,</v>

730
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.153
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

731
00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.130
<v Speaker 2>off here offers shoes up to you.</v>

732
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.170
<v Speaker 3>You would look really good.</v>

733
00:20:52.171 --> 00:20:54.810
<v Speaker 3>And what's been the biggest change over your career?</v>

734
00:20:54.811 --> 00:20:54.961
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

735
00:20:54.961 --> 00:20:55.794
<v Speaker 3>cause you,</v>

736
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.060
<v Speaker 3>you've been around for,</v>

737
00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:57.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

738
00:20:57.601 --> 00:21:02.601
<v Speaker 3>I think the first time I saw you fight was 96 or 97 something.</v>

739
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.140
<v Speaker 3>Something along those lines.</v>

740
00:21:04.141 --> 00:21:04.381
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

741
00:21:04.381 --> 00:21:04.620
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

742
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.680
<v Speaker 3>what year was super broad when you fighting Superbowl 99.</v>

743
00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:08.693
<v Speaker 3>99.</v>

744
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:09.430
<v Speaker 3>That's when it was,</v>

745
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.761
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

746
00:21:09.761 --> 00:21:11.080
<v Speaker 2>99 was the tournament.</v>

747
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

748
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.090
<v Speaker 2>2000 was Dan Severn and then 2001 was my first UFC fight.</v>

749
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.070
<v Speaker 2>So what was your first MMA fight?</v>

750
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:19.300
<v Speaker 2>The first ever MMA fight?</v>

751
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

752
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.320
<v Speaker 2>my first ever MMA fight was probably,</v>

753
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.140
<v Speaker 2>it was 1997 of January.</v>

754
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.940
<v Speaker 2>I was on winter vacation from the University of Montana and I got a call from an</v>

755
00:21:30.941 --> 00:21:31.900
<v Speaker 2>old wrestling coach,</v>

756
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.830

758
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:34.630

759
00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:38.590
<v Speaker 2>he knew I was into it and at the time he was actually doing Matt Hume's website.</v>

<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

777
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

778
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.960
<v Speaker 2>when I was like an 11 days,</v>

779
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:57.340
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

780
00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:57.821
<v Speaker 2>what do I need?</v>

781
00:21:57.821 --> 00:21:58.121
<v Speaker 2>Where do I,</v>

782
00:21:58.121 --> 00:21:59.020
<v Speaker 2>when do I need to be there?</v>

783
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:00.963
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

784
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.710
<v Speaker 2>I trained with a,</v>

785
00:22:02.711 --> 00:22:04.390
<v Speaker 2>an old training partner of mine,</v>

786
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:05.680
<v Speaker 2>this Guy Edward Romana Rosa.</v>

787
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.130
<v Speaker 2>We used to do colleague and some Thai boxing and self defense stuff,</v>

788
00:22:09.131 --> 00:22:09.731
<v Speaker 2>knife fighting,</v>

789
00:22:09.731 --> 00:22:10.570
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of shit.</v>

790
00:22:10.571 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

791
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.520
<v Speaker 2>But we're all neophytes,</v>

792
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:13.031
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

793
00:22:13.031 --> 00:22:13.721
<v Speaker 2>at the time.</v>

794
00:22:13.721 --> 00:22:15.430
<v Speaker 2>But we did the best we could.</v>

795
00:22:15.431 --> 00:22:18.850
<v Speaker 2>I would run up the hill from Ballard to Phinney Ridge.</v>

796
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.140
<v Speaker 2>I would meet him.</v>

797
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:25.180
<v Speaker 2>We would either go to the park and he would have me do stuff like throw on the</v>

798
00:22:25.181 --> 00:22:25.601
<v Speaker 2>bag,</v>

799
00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:27.670
<v Speaker 2>the big army duffle full of gear that we had.</v>

800
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:32.590
<v Speaker 2>I'd throw that on and I'd hit tie pads on an incline because it was fucking hard</v>

801
00:22:32.591 --> 00:22:33.011
<v Speaker 2>as shit.</v>

802
00:22:33.011 --> 00:22:33.311
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

803
00:22:33.311 --> 00:22:35.110
<v Speaker 2>So I haven't checked up and I had a crawl,</v>

804
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.130
<v Speaker 2>walk up this hill and kick these pads and then he would have me do stuff.</v>

805
00:22:39.131 --> 00:22:41.050
<v Speaker 2>Like we didn't have mats and things like that.</v>

806
00:22:41.051 --> 00:22:43.150
<v Speaker 2>So I would just be on the carpet.</v>

807
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.010
<v Speaker 2>I just sit there and take a position,</v>

808
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.430
<v Speaker 2>be blindfold me and just fucking jump on me.</v>

809
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.030
<v Speaker 2>There are many manuals.</v>

810
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:53.890
<v Speaker 2>It fully just jump on me and I'd have to figure my way out of whatever was going</v>

811
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:54.071
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

812
00:22:54.071 --> 00:22:54.821
<v Speaker 2>I had to feel it.</v>

813
00:22:54.821 --> 00:22:55.654
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>

814
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.410
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't Tabay sloppy.</v>

815
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I had to figure out what was going on and get to where I needed to be and then</v>

816
00:23:02.531 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 2>finish.</v>

817
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like some pink panther type Shit Dude.</v>

818
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:06.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

819
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.090
<v Speaker 2>just jump out at them.</v>

820
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

821
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.440
<v Speaker 2>just come out of the,</v>

822
00:23:08.441 --> 00:23:09.520
<v Speaker 2>out of the closet or whatever.</v>

823
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Kendo stick and taking me out.</v>

824
00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean it wasn't far from it.</v>

825
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

826
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:18.120
<v Speaker 2>but in the end it was about sharpening the mental aspect of it and just being</v>

827
00:23:18.521 --> 00:23:19.060
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

828
00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:19.893
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

829
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.810
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go out there and you're going to destroy this guy no matter</v>

830
00:23:22.811 --> 00:23:23.350
<v Speaker 2>what.</v>

831
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.360
<v Speaker 2>And I choked him unconscious in two minutes.</v>

832
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.880
<v Speaker 2>What was it was about sort of like making up the training as you go along,</v>

833
00:23:29.881 --> 00:23:33.100
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure it out and have real MMA gloves.</v>

834
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.620
<v Speaker 2>We had to make 'em out of harbinger,</v>

835
00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.130
<v Speaker 2>a bad gloves.</v>

836
00:23:36.131 --> 00:23:39.880
<v Speaker 2>We had to cut the bar out of the palm and cut something else off and there you</v>

837
00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:40.180
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

838
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.810
<v Speaker 2>There's an MMA glove and then we didn't have real trunks.</v>

839
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.800
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have,</v>

840
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.831
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have anything.</v>

841
00:23:45.831 --> 00:23:46.431
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was no,</v>

842
00:23:46.431 --> 00:23:47.390
<v Speaker 2>imma make gear that you could just,</v>

843
00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:49.370
<v Speaker 2>I went to a sporting good store to get,</v>

844
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:50.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

848
00:23:57.411 --> 00:23:58.430
<v Speaker 2>And even most of the time.</v>

849
00:23:58.431 --> 00:23:59.340
<v Speaker 2>So my first one,</v>

850
00:23:59.341 --> 00:24:00.111
<v Speaker 2>it was 97.</v>

851
00:24:00.111 --> 00:24:05.111
<v Speaker 2>Then I would fight guys whenever I could on mats here,</v>

852

<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

890
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:44.120
<v Speaker 2>I remember picking up this dude from the east coast and shooting in on a double</v>

891
00:24:44.121 --> 00:24:45.990
<v Speaker 2>picking him up sky and him booms,</v>

892
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Speaker 2>slamming the shit out of him and we had this big cargo net and hung down because</v>

893
00:24:50.391 --> 00:24:51.380
<v Speaker 2>there was all these,</v>

894
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.633
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

895
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.840
<v Speaker 2>full courts basketballers like three or four full court basketball courts that</v>

896
00:24:56.841 --> 00:24:57.390
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>

897
00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:58.223
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

898
00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:58.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

899
00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:59.960
<v Speaker 2>perpendicular to this whole thing.</v>

900
00:24:59.961 --> 00:25:02.060
<v Speaker 2>So are you're running up and down on the other side,</v>

901
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.380
<v Speaker 2>cargo nets to keep balls from flying over into this other and onto the matted</v>

902
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.720
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

903
00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.553
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>

904
00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:06.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

905
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.080
<v Speaker 2>there was a rock climbing wall and some other little stuff,</v>

906
00:25:09.081 --> 00:25:11.540
<v Speaker 2>so to keep the basketball stuff in the basketball area.</v>

907
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:16.340
<v Speaker 2>And then there was like a little room that they had built for a women's workout</v>

908
00:25:16.341 --> 00:25:16.670
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

909
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:17.960
<v Speaker 2>So there was little cardio machines,</v>

910
00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:21.740
<v Speaker 2>a little windows that they could look out across the mats and onto the</v>

911
00:25:21.741 --> 00:25:22.574
<v Speaker 2>basketball courts.</v>

912
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:28.300
<v Speaker 2>People would stop playing basketball and hang on the cargo net thing and just</v>

913
00:25:29.031 --> 00:25:32.000
<v Speaker 2>cheer and Talk Shit and whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

916
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.450
<v Speaker 2>one man,</v>

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.063
<v Speaker 2>wham.</v>

923
00:25:46.731 --> 00:25:47.960
<v Speaker 2>back until he quits.</v>

927
00:25:51.861 --> 00:25:54.410

<v Speaker 2>bag downstairs and that would be the dude I'd always like.</v>

990
00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:29.951
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that,</v>

991
00:27:29.951 --> 00:27:32.310
<v Speaker 2>did you think that this is going to be a career or were you just enjoying</v>

992
00:27:32.311 --> 00:27:32.970
<v Speaker 2>yourself?</v>

993
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:33.301
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

994
00:27:33.301 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 2>I intended fully to,</v>

995
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.850
<v Speaker 2>this was a point there.</v>

996
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I told the people that are trained with back at Jim Harrison's place,</v>

997
00:27:40.861 --> 00:27:42.570
<v Speaker 2>which is by the way,</v>

998
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.550
<v Speaker 2>that is a put up or shut up,</v>

999
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.200
<v Speaker 2>no bullshit.</v>

1000
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.950
<v Speaker 2>If you come in trying to be a big shot,</v>

1001
00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.980
<v Speaker 2>you will get your fucking teeth knocked out and you don't,</v>

1002
00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:56.820
<v Speaker 2>that's not the place to try and be a tough guy.</v>

1003
00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:57.451
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1004
00:27:57.451 --> 00:27:57.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1005
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Jim Harrison's is about as tough and as mean as a come.</v>

1006
00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:01.021
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1007
00:28:01.021 --> 00:28:01.854

1009
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1010
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.880
<v Speaker 2>was a big help towards me developing who I am as a fighter.</v>

1011
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.430
<v Speaker 2>It was a first US light heavyweight kickboxing champion,</v>

1012
00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:09.630
<v Speaker 2>and he was a judo champion.</v>

1013
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.660
<v Speaker 2>He fought the bare knuckle karate back in the day,</v>

1014
00:28:12.661 --> 00:28:14.070
<v Speaker 2>like with Chuck Norris and all of them.</v>

1015
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.440
<v Speaker 2>He was a super foot Wallace's trainer.</v>

1016
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:18.990
<v Speaker 2>This dude is legit.</v>

1017
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.980
<v Speaker 2>And so when we'd get guys that come in the gym and they'd start doing all this</v>

1018
00:28:22.981 --> 00:28:24.240
<v Speaker 2>stuff and acting pretty cocky,</v>

1019
00:28:24.241 --> 00:28:25.680
<v Speaker 2>and then we just take turns like,</v>

1020
00:28:25.681 --> 00:28:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1021
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.020
<v Speaker 2>who's gonna kick the shit out of this guy tonight?</v>

1022
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.513
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1023
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1024
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:35.240
<v Speaker 2>so I'm out there a training and I said to the junior instructor there,</v>

1025
00:28:35.341 --> 00:28:35.701
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1026
00:28:35.701 --> 00:28:36.534
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1027
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:36.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1028
00:28:36.901 --> 00:28:37.141
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1029
00:28:37.141 --> 00:28:41.040
<v Speaker 2>my goal is by the time I'm 24 I want to be in the UFC.</v>

1030
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.590
<v Speaker 2>And that just kind of chuckle and he goes,</v>

1031
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.540
<v Speaker 2>by the time you're 24,</v>

1032
00:28:45.541 --> 00:28:46.650
<v Speaker 2>you're going to win the UFC.</v>

1033
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.800
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

1034
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.460
<v Speaker 2>fuck you thought there was a career in this from the very beginning.</v>

1035
00:28:53.461 --> 00:28:55.010
<v Speaker 2>I watched the tapes in Japan.</v>

1036
00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:55.440
<v Speaker 2>I saw that you,</v>

1037
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I just thought with this,</v>

1038
00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what kind of a living one would make.</v>

1039
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.250
<v Speaker 2>I imagine you could probably sustain yourself,</v>

1040
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.113
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1041
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I knew that I would get a chance to see the world and beat up it's people.</v>

1042
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.420
<v Speaker 2>So that was your actual approach like you from the very beginning,</v>

1043
00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.700
<v Speaker 2>the beaten up these guys and the basketball court,</v>

1044
00:29:14.701 --> 00:29:15.840
<v Speaker 2>you were thinking,</v>

1045
00:29:15.841 --> 00:29:15.991
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1046
00:29:15.991 --> 00:29:18.450
<v Speaker 2>this is just training towards my ultimate goal.</v>

1047
00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:19.284
<v Speaker 2>I need to fight.</v>

1048
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:19.981
<v Speaker 2>I all,</v>

1049
00:29:19.981 --> 00:29:23.700
<v Speaker 2>these guys are showing up with 250 and old records and all this crazy shit.</v>

1050
00:29:23.701 --> 00:29:24.001
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1051
00:29:24.001 --> 00:29:25.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to go under 50.</v>

1052
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.570
<v Speaker 2>I better get the I'm way behind.</v>

1053
00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.460
<v Speaker 2>I better start fighting people,</v>

1054
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:30.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1055
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.260
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to do when I re I fight the guy that's got at least,</v>

1056
00:29:34.261 --> 00:29:34.710

<v Speaker 2>95 fights fun.</v>

1058
00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.770
<v Speaker 2>You should really write a book about all this shit.</v>

1059
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I know you were one of the,</v>

1060
00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:40.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you really think about it,</v>

1061
00:29:40.381 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Speaker 2>you were one of the pioneers</v>

1062
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.461
<v Speaker 1>that there was.</v>

1063
00:29:42.461 --> 00:29:47.461
<v Speaker 1>You were around just a few years after the beginning of the UFC and you know,</v>

1064
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:49.870
<v Speaker 1>you won the UFC title.</v>

1065
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:52.570
<v Speaker 1>What was that like five years after you first started fighting?</v>

1066
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.321
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1068
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:57.303

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.653

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1071
00:29:59.051 --> 00:29:59.884
<v Speaker 1>Why did I think it was?</v>

1072
00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1073
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:00.700
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:01.811
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1076
00:30:01.811 --> 00:30:03.070

1077
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.640
<v Speaker 1>cause I wasn't working for the UFC when you weren't five or six years of</v>

1078
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:11.110
<v Speaker 1>training with three years of three years of wrestling,</v>

1079
00:30:11.111 --> 00:30:11.950
<v Speaker 1>two years did judo.</v>

1080
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.301

1083
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you really stop and think about it,</v>

1084
00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:17.650
<v Speaker 1>that is a really crazy path.</v>

1085
00:30:17.651 --> 00:30:19.000
<v Speaker 1>You really should write a book then.</v>

1086
00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.080
<v Speaker 1>We used to go to that.</v>

1087
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I like to be around and worry about all the people that would get thrown under</v>

1088
00:30:23.111 --> 00:30:23.650
<v Speaker 1>the bus.</v>

1089
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Not on purpose.</v>

1090
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.020

1094
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I prefer to keep that on the DL.</v>

1095
00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:35.470
<v Speaker 1>That brings us to one of the things we were supposed to talk about on this show</v>

1096
00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:36.610
<v Speaker 1>that we need to talk about.</v>

1102
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:47.770
<v Speaker 1>but he had one particular story that pissed you off and it was a story about</v>

<v Speaker 4>we do two rounds.</v>

1161
00:31:54.211 --> 00:31:55.044
<v Speaker 4>After two rounds,</v>

1162
00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:58.770
<v Speaker 4>he takes his glove off and he throws it across the room.</v>

1163
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.180
<v Speaker 4>He takes a shim pad off,</v>

1164
00:32:00.181 --> 00:32:01.620
<v Speaker 4>throws it across the room,</v>

1165
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.610
<v Speaker 4>he packs his bag,</v>

1166
00:32:02.611 --> 00:32:02.931
<v Speaker 4>he stole,</v>

1167
00:32:02.931 --> 00:32:03.764
<v Speaker 4>stolen is out,</v>

1168
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.531
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

1169
00:32:04.531 --> 00:32:05.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1170
00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.230
<v Speaker 4>they go on to Tokyo the next day to find them.</v>

1171
00:32:07.231 --> 00:32:08.250
<v Speaker 4>The New Year's Eve.</v>

1172
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.760
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1173
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.593
<v Speaker 4>pride tournament,</v>

1174
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:10.740
<v Speaker 4>I forget who it was against.</v>

1175
00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.053
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1176
00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.220
<v Speaker 4>and then a bet a week passes.</v>

1177
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:15.120
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1178
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.200
<v Speaker 4>Josh loses his flight.</v>

1179
00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.760
<v Speaker 4>I get a phone call from Eric Paulson about three or four days later,</v>

1180
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:21.780
<v Speaker 4>ones once I get back.</v>

1181
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:22.500
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

1182
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.070
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1183
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:23.251
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1184
00:32:23.251 --> 00:32:23.750
<v Speaker 4>this is Eric.</v>

1185
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:24.490
<v Speaker 4>Hey going,</v>

1186
00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:24.870
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1187
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:29.870
<v Speaker 4>I just want to let you know that we blame you on Joshua's loss because he was</v>

1188
00:32:30.181 --> 00:32:32.430
<v Speaker 4>fine right up until he spied you.</v>

1189
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:36.360
<v Speaker 4>And then some kid that had never seen before owned him in the spine and took</v>

1190
00:32:36.361 --> 00:32:37.290
<v Speaker 4>away all his confidence.</v>

1191
00:32:37.291 --> 00:32:38.280
<v Speaker 4>So when he got to Japan,</v>

1192
00:32:38.281 --> 00:32:39.114
<v Speaker 4>he was a,</v>

1193
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 4>and no</v>

1194
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 3>way this is a true story.</v>

1195
00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:42.141
<v Speaker 3>I kid,</v>

1196
00:32:42.141 --> 00:32:42.974
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1197
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.371
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1198
00:32:43.371 --> 00:32:44.090
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1199
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.990
<v Speaker 3>how ridiculous,</v>

1200
00:32:44.991 --> 00:32:47.570
<v Speaker 3>or they to take a guy like you would,</v>

1201
00:32:47.571 --> 00:32:48.100
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

1202
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:48.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1203
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:49.700
<v Speaker 3>I was always just that.</v>

1204
00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:50.920
<v Speaker 3>And you go and the gym and it's like,</v>

1205
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:51.131
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1206
00:32:51.131 --> 00:32:51.271
<v Speaker 3>Yay.</v>

1207
00:32:51.271 --> 00:32:51.900
<v Speaker 3>You spot him off.</v>

1208
00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:52.733
<v Speaker 3>You can cut it off there.</v>

1209
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.950
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

1210
00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:58.670
<v Speaker 3>the fight that you fought in Japan for the new year show was the,</v>

1211
00:32:58.671 --> 00:32:59.270
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1212
00:32:59.270 --> 00:32:59.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1213
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:00.720
<v Speaker 3>Minotauro Nogueira fight,</v>

1214
00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:01.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1215
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:01.431
<v Speaker 3>Which,</v>

1216
00:33:01.431 --> 00:33:01.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1217
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:02.421
<v Speaker 3>that was a fight.</v>

1218
00:33:02.421 --> 00:33:02.960
<v Speaker 3>What you,</v>

1219
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.520
<v Speaker 3>it was very close fight.</v>

1220
00:33:04.521 --> 00:33:06.340
<v Speaker 3>And you actually had a leg lock lock?</v>

1221
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:06.550
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1222
00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:06.680
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1223
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:06.811
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1224
00:33:06.811 --> 00:33:07.550
<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>

1225
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.630
<v Speaker 2>the second time I fought him that year.</v>

1226
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:10.770
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1227
00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.420
<v Speaker 2>it was definitely nasty front choke on them.</v>

1228
00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Then he managed to just barely escape.</v>

1229
00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I picked him up and slammed him on his head.</v>

1230
00:33:16.501 --> 00:33:16.920
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1231
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I whacked out.</v>

1232
00:33:17.941 --> 00:33:18.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bit,</v>

1233
00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:19.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1234
00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.190
<v Speaker 2>up top and down below,</v>

1235
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:20.941
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1236
00:33:20.941 --> 00:33:21.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1237
00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:22.710
<v Speaker 2>he pretty much stalled me out.</v>

1238
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:24.780
<v Speaker 2>He tried to hold me down most of the fight.</v>

1239
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.770
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1240
00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.480
<v Speaker 2>in the end they gave him the decision,</v>

1241
00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:28.350
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

1242
00:33:28.351 --> 00:33:29.670
<v Speaker 2>what they wanted was a trilogy.</v>

1243
00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.890
<v Speaker 2>So I think it was a bullshit decision.</v>

1244
00:33:31.891 --> 00:33:35.190
<v Speaker 2>But if I don't finish a guy and that the judges make a shitty call,</v>

1245
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.401
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1246
00:33:35.401 --> 00:33:36.360
<v Speaker 2>well that's my fault.</v>

1247
00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Still not the judges,</v>

1248
00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.280
<v Speaker 3>but that's neither here nor there.</v>

1249
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:40.060
<v Speaker 3>Right in the store.</v>

1250
00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:40.781
<v Speaker 3>Really pissed you off.</v>

1251
00:33:40.781 --> 00:33:41.930
<v Speaker 3>So express yourself well.</v>

1252
00:33:41.931 --> 00:33:42.220
<v Speaker 3>Well</v>

1253
00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:42.750
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

1254
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:44.150
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

1255
00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:45.343
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>

1256
00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:45.780
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1257
00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.030
<v Speaker 2>this guy came in and,</v>

1258
00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:47.980
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1259
00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.800
<v Speaker 2>and I even made sure to go back through my mental rolodex about this because</v>

1260
00:33:51.801 --> 00:33:52.490
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest,</v>

1261
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:57.490
<v Speaker 2>I had a pretty vivid memory about training with John Wayne Bar because I knew</v>

1262
00:33:58.611 --> 00:34:00.020
<v Speaker 2>absolutely who he was.</v>

1263
00:34:00.021 --> 00:34:00.854
<v Speaker 2>And when he showed up,</v>

1264
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:05.240
<v Speaker 2>I know he was not unknown to all these people at the gym.</v>

1265
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:07.040
<v Speaker 2>And not to mention Eric Paulson,</v>

1266
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.341
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1267
00:34:07.341 --> 00:34:10.250
<v Speaker 2>we'll make sure to introduce if somebody of notoriety came in,</v>

1268
00:34:10.251 --> 00:34:11.300
<v Speaker 2>if you showed up right now,</v>

1269
00:34:11.301 --> 00:34:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1270
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.180
<v Speaker 2>if people had been living in a cave,</v>

1271
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.111
<v Speaker 2>he would talk.</v>

1272
00:34:15.111 --> 00:34:15.860
<v Speaker 2>He would say,</v>

1273
00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:16.810
<v Speaker 2>this is Joe Rogan.</v>

1274
00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:17.631
<v Speaker 2>He did taekwondo,</v>

1275
00:34:17.631 --> 00:34:18.171
<v Speaker 2>he did this,</v>

1276
00:34:18.171 --> 00:34:19.550
<v Speaker 2>and now you may know he will.</v>

1277
00:34:19.551 --> 00:34:23.390
<v Speaker 2>He always makes sure that everybody who shows up gets their due respect and is</v>

1278
00:34:23.391 --> 00:34:24.860
<v Speaker 2>introduced properly to everybody.</v>

1279
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.113
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1280
00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.650
<v Speaker 2>John Wayne Park,</v>

1281
00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:31.040
<v Speaker 2>I watched him fight at the sands before he came and trained with us.</v>

1282
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.470
<v Speaker 2>I watched him fight Muay Thai.</v>

1283
00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:35.150
<v Speaker 2>I'd seen him fight in white tie before I knew who his wife was.</v>

1284
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1285
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.681
<v Speaker 2>Angie Rivera,</v>

1286
00:34:36.681 --> 00:34:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I had seen her fight before.</v>

1287
00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:39.000
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1288
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.170
<v Speaker 2>I know all about John Wayne par before he'd ever gotten to our gym.</v>

1289
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.420
<v Speaker 2>And he shows up and I'm going,</v>

1290
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.111
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck,</v>

1291
00:34:45.111 --> 00:34:46.310
<v Speaker 2>that's so fucking cool.</v>

1292
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.760
<v Speaker 2>And I made a point to come up to John and tell him,</v>

1293
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.710
<v Speaker 2>I watched your fight at the,</v>

1294
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:52.491
<v Speaker 2>at the sands.</v>

1295
00:34:52.491 --> 00:34:53.211
<v Speaker 2>I was there,</v>

1296
00:34:53.211 --> 00:34:55.100
<v Speaker 2>I've seen you five to know all about you.</v>

1297
00:34:55.250 --> 00:35:00.250
<v Speaker 2>And I deliberately spent time training with John as much as I could,</v>

1298
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:04.880
<v Speaker 2>as much as I could.</v>

1299
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.040
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing,</v>

1300
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.200
<v Speaker 2>John had a MMA fight coming up against,</v>

1301
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:13.223
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1302
00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1303
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:14.893
<v Speaker 2>Tony,</v>

1304
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.823
<v Speaker 2>Tony Brunello.</v>

1305
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:20.360
<v Speaker 2>So he's an RGM to try and figure out this whole MMA game.</v>

1306
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:25.790
<v Speaker 2>And I even put extra time into John trying to help him out,</v>

1307
00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:29.720
<v Speaker 2>trying to teach him about defending the take down and try to be more defensive</v>

1308
00:35:29.721 --> 00:35:30.420
<v Speaker 2>as a grappler.</v>

1309
00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.310
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1310
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.120
<v Speaker 2>we all,</v>

1311
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.760
<v Speaker 2>everybody there was really kind and helpful to him,</v>

1312
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:35.870
<v Speaker 2>especially myself.</v>

1313
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to spar with him as many times as possible.</v>

1314
00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Why was at the gym,</v>

1315
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.830
<v Speaker 2>because he is such a good fighter,</v>

1316
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.200
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time he's a lot smaller than me,</v>

1317
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:48.570
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not trying to win.</v>

1318
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to learn.</v>

1319
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to take 250 pounds and kick him and hurt him and bust him up and</v>

1320
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:57.870
<v Speaker 2>make this a competition about who's better.</v>

1321
00:35:58.410 --> 00:35:58.951
<v Speaker 2>If anything,</v>

1322
00:35:58.951 --> 00:36:00.210
<v Speaker 2>I would just play,</v>

1323
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.471
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>

1324
00:36:00.471 --> 00:36:00.711
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>

1325
00:36:00.711 --> 00:36:00.951
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>

1326
00:36:00.951 --> 00:36:02.010
<v Speaker 2>play and you know his,</v>

1327
00:36:02.011 --> 00:36:05.090
<v Speaker 2>his striking is so unorthodox versus a stand,</v>

1328
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.590
<v Speaker 2>a boxing rhythm and,</v>

1329
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.990
<v Speaker 2>and even what you might consider sometimes the standard Thai boxing rhythm he</v>

1330
00:36:09.991 --> 00:36:12.960
<v Speaker 2>punches on on on weird timing and where we're at,</v>

1331
00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.960
<v Speaker 2>timing signatures and weird rhythms and his elbows are super high,</v>

1332
00:36:15.961 --> 00:36:17.130
<v Speaker 2>which normally people would be like,</v>

1333
00:36:17.131 --> 00:36:17.964
<v Speaker 2>that's Shitty,</v>

1334
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:21.330
<v Speaker 2>but he makes it all work and he's got a great kick in good reactions and good</v>

1335
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.560
<v Speaker 2>footwork.</v>

1336
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.690
<v Speaker 2>So we played a lot,</v>

1337
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:28.740
<v Speaker 2>but there was never any ass kicking on my part.</v>

1338
00:36:28.741 --> 00:36:29.430
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>

1339
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:33.870
<v Speaker 2>I never chucked my gloves across the room because this new guy just showed up</v>

1340
00:36:33.871 --> 00:36:34.680
<v Speaker 2>and beat me up.</v>

1341
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1342
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.450
<v Speaker 2>that's all fucking bullshit.</v>

1343
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think you would say that?</v>

1344
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's been punched in the head too many times.</v>

1345
00:36:40.381 --> 00:36:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he sees that as his opportunity to get some sort of fame.</v>

1346
00:36:43.471 --> 00:36:45.420
<v Speaker 2>I guess he's got a documentary out,</v>

1347
00:36:45.421 --> 00:36:46.254
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1348
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:46.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1349
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:48.090
<v Speaker 2>I dunno what he's lying about in that,</v>

1350
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:49.140
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1351
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.030
<v Speaker 2>clearly this guy is delusional.</v>

1352
00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.213
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1353
00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:53.071
<v Speaker 2>and even still,</v>

1354
00:36:53.071 --> 00:36:54.930
<v Speaker 2>there's like that unwritten rule about training,</v>

1355
00:36:54.931 --> 00:36:55.141
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1356
00:36:55.141 --> 00:36:55.980
<v Speaker 2>You don't talk about it.</v>

1357
00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.650
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1358
00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.493
<v Speaker 2>that being said,</v>

1359
00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.120
<v Speaker 2>when we did spar,</v>

1360
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:04.050
<v Speaker 2>there was at least there was one time where I put him on the floor by accident,</v>

1361
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:09.440
<v Speaker 2>just timed a right middle kick against his right hand and it just clunked him</v>

1362
00:37:09.991 --> 00:37:10.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1363
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.570
<v Speaker 2>And right in the right spot down to the floor.</v>

1364
00:37:12.571 --> 00:37:16.410
<v Speaker 2>He goes and we laughed because we thought,</v>

1365
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>

1366
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:17.491
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1367
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:18.540
<v Speaker 2>I didn't throw that hard.</v>

1368
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.201
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1369
00:37:19.201 --> 00:37:19.421
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1370
00:37:19.421 --> 00:37:19.861
<v Speaker 2>that was just,</v>

1371
00:37:19.861 --> 00:37:21.960
<v Speaker 2>that was just a hell a shift that was really well placed.</v>

1372
00:37:21.961 --> 00:37:22.460
<v Speaker 2>And we just,</v>

1373
00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:22.861
<v Speaker 2>what we,</v>

1374
00:37:22.861 --> 00:37:23.431
<v Speaker 2>what did we do?</v>

1375
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:25.770
<v Speaker 2>We figured out how to repeat it because we thought,</v>

1376
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>

1377
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:28.530
<v Speaker 2>if if one could land that kicked,</v>

1378
00:37:28.531 --> 00:37:30.210
<v Speaker 2>just write be a great quick,</v>

1379
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.100
<v Speaker 2>it'd be great thing to have in one's arsenal,</v>

1380
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.910
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're not even trying to hurt someone.</v>

1381
00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:34.830
<v Speaker 2>They'd get hurt so bad.</v>

1382
00:37:34.831 --> 00:37:35.131
<v Speaker 2>The drug.</v>

1383
00:37:35.131 --> 00:37:35.341
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1384
00:37:35.341 --> 00:37:35.481
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1385
00:37:35.481 --> 00:37:35.851
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1386
00:37:35.851 --> 00:37:36.684
<v Speaker 2>I got a big,</v>

1387
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:37.561
<v Speaker 2>big heavy leg,</v>

1388
00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:37.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1389
00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:40.500
<v Speaker 2>so I don't fault him for that.</v>

1390
00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:40.831
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1391
00:37:40.831 --> 00:37:41.041
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1392
00:37:41.041 --> 00:37:42.360
<v Speaker 2>it's not like we're trying to win.</v>

1393
00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.230
<v Speaker 2>How many just sparked,</v>

1394
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:43.950
<v Speaker 2>sparked him,</v>

1395
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:44.580
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1396
00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.413
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1397
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:46.081
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

1398
00:37:46.081 --> 00:37:46.501
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

1399
00:37:46.501 --> 00:37:46.860
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

1400
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:47.521
<v Speaker 2>eight times,</v>

1401
00:37:47.521 --> 00:37:47.881
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1402
00:37:47.881 --> 00:37:48.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1403
00:37:48.061 --> 00:37:50.250
<v Speaker 2>he was there for a good bit and then he disappeared,</v>

1404
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.070
<v Speaker 2>which I guess he took off to Thomas Denny's.</v>

1405
00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:54.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>

1406
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.920
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1407
00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.753
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1408
00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:56.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1409
00:37:56.341 --> 00:37:58.950
<v Speaker 2>it's not like he was having to pay to be at CSW at the time,</v>

1410
00:37:59.550 --> 00:37:59.821
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1411
00:37:59.821 --> 00:38:00.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1412
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:00.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1413
00:38:00.331 --> 00:38:01.310
<v Speaker 2>when it came to MMA,</v>

1414
00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.620
<v Speaker 2>he got murdered on the feed in,</v>

1415
00:38:04.621 --> 00:38:05.454
<v Speaker 2>on the ground.</v>

1416
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.380
<v Speaker 2>And not because he's a bad Stryker,</v>

1417
00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:10.410
<v Speaker 2>it's because he didn't have the rhythm yet.</v>

1418
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1419
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:16.930
<v Speaker 2>a little rhythm of stopping takedowns there with the tension of the takedown</v>

1420
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.821
<v Speaker 2>distance,</v>

1421
00:38:17.821 --> 00:38:18.750
<v Speaker 2>the clinch distance,</v>

1422
00:38:18.751 --> 00:38:19.110
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1423
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:20.070
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't end,</v>

1424
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.233
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1425
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1426
00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:25.530
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of little things that change the way you pattern your shots,</v>

1427
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.210
<v Speaker 2>the way you would angle the way you would foot work.</v>

1428
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.493
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1429
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:29.340
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1430
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:29.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1431
00:38:29.581 --> 00:38:32.220
<v Speaker 2>just in a straight Thai boxing said scenario,</v>

1432
00:38:32.221 --> 00:38:33.360
<v Speaker 2>of course he's very relaxed.</v>

1433
00:38:33.361 --> 00:38:34.580
<v Speaker 2>But with MMA,</v>

1434
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 2>with everything that comes with it,</v>

1435
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.270
<v Speaker 2>he's not so relaxed,</v>

1436
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.740
<v Speaker 2>which is no fault of his.</v>

1437
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1438
00:38:39.101 --> 00:38:44.101
<v Speaker 2>He talked about not pursuing MMA because he was such an expert in Moitai Thai</v>

1439
00:38:44.381 --> 00:38:48.940
<v Speaker 2>and he didn't like the fact that like when he would do Jujitsu or wrestling or</v>

1440
00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:49.390
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

1441
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:50.920
<v Speaker 2>he just was so out of his element.</v>

1442
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:51.461
<v Speaker 2>He didn't,</v>

1443
00:38:51.461 --> 00:38:52.780
<v Speaker 2>didn't like being a beginner again.</v>

1444
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:53.651
<v Speaker 2>What does that well,</v>

1445
00:38:53.651 --> 00:38:53.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1446
00:38:53.951 --> 00:38:54.784
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

1447
00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.590
<v Speaker 2>that's quitting.</v>

1448
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:57.790
<v Speaker 2>That's what that is.</v>

1449
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.640
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't fucking good at Moitai to begin with either.</v>

1450
00:39:00.641 --> 00:39:01.474
<v Speaker 2>I promise you.</v>

1451
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.021
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1452
00:39:02.021 --> 00:39:05.380
<v Speaker 2>But he was by the time you started and that's hard for people to start over.</v>

1453
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like taking a guy who has,</v>

1454
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:07.743
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

1455
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:08.860
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1456
00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.180
<v Speaker 2>by the time he started MMA,</v>

1457
00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:11.410
<v Speaker 2>he was already good at one thing.</v>

1458
00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:14.110
<v Speaker 2>He got so used to being good at one thing.</v>

1459
00:39:14.111 --> 00:39:15.760
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't stand to be a white belt again.</v>

1460
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Well then it definitely wasn't for you.</v>

1461
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1462
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.630
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>

1463
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:24.040
<v Speaker 2>I guess you don't like potentially learning new languages or a real reading,</v>

1464
00:39:24.041 --> 00:39:24.874
<v Speaker 2>new books,</v>

1465
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:25.630
<v Speaker 2>learning,</v>

1466
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:26.350
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

1467
00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:30.130
<v Speaker 2>You can stay in your little hole and clearly MMA wasn't for him.</v>

1468
00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.211
<v Speaker 2>Some people though,</v>

1469
00:39:31.211 --> 00:39:33.370
<v Speaker 2>they get a little bit of success a little bit.</v>

1470
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.910
<v Speaker 2>Obviously he got a large amount of success and money.</v>

1471
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Do you think he made Thai boxing?</v>

1472
00:39:38.111 --> 00:39:38.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1473
00:39:38.381 --> 00:39:39.180
<v Speaker 2>very little.</v>

1474
00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1475
00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:44.850
<v Speaker 2>So he probably thought MMA was going to be a way to get more notoriety,</v>

1476
00:39:45.071 --> 00:39:45.551
<v Speaker 2>more money,</v>

1477
00:39:45.551 --> 00:39:46.121
<v Speaker 2>more whatever.</v>

1478
00:39:46.121 --> 00:39:49.750
<v Speaker 2>And then when he realized that wasn't going to happen the way he thought it was,</v>

1479
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.823
<v Speaker 2>he quit.</v>

1480
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:51.041
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1481
00:39:51.041 --> 00:39:54.880
<v Speaker 2>you'll see guys that have really decorated Moitai careers and they struggle to</v>

1482
00:39:54.881 --> 00:39:56.650
<v Speaker 2>make it an MMA serial.</v>

1483
00:39:56.651 --> 00:39:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Dia Bata is good example is a guy who's pretty successful in MMA.</v>

1484
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:02.940
<v Speaker 2>He was pretty successful but really good at Moitai.</v>

1485
00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1486
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.971
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1487
00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:05.510
<v Speaker 2>The world champion and Muay Thai and this,</v>

1488
00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.270
<v Speaker 2>that transition is,</v>

1489
00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:09.040
<v Speaker 2>is it ain't easy.</v>

1490
00:40:09.041 --> 00:40:09.581
<v Speaker 2>If it was easy,</v>

1491
00:40:09.581 --> 00:40:10.271
<v Speaker 2>everybody would do it.</v>

1492
00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:10.930
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1493
00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:11.763
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1494
00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:17.260
<v Speaker 2>but as far as kicking my ass at man has never kicked my ass and his entire life.</v>

1495
00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:17.980
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

1496
00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:21.400
<v Speaker 2>And you know what's so weird is I was a John Wayne Park Fan.</v>

1497
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:27.120
<v Speaker 2>I meet the guy at my gym and make a point to not only help him,</v>

1498
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.920
<v Speaker 2>but to train with him,</v>

1499
00:40:29.921 --> 00:40:30.910
<v Speaker 2>to learn from him,</v>

1500
00:40:30.911 --> 00:40:32.230
<v Speaker 2>to have that experience,</v>

1501
00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.490
<v Speaker 2>to be there,</v>

1502
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:34.960
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

1503
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.201
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1504
00:40:35.201 --> 00:40:35.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1505
00:40:35.381 --> 00:40:37.660
<v Speaker 2>when am I going to get a chance to train with John Wayne par again?</v>

1506
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.060
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to have the both of you on a podcast next.</v>

1507
00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:44.500
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be some fucking all could happen is that he's just going to go,</v>

1508
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.041
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1509
00:40:45.041 --> 00:40:45.281
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1510
00:40:45.281 --> 00:40:46.360
<v Speaker 2>it happened this way and I'm just like,</v>

1511
00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:47.194
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up.</v>

1512
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:49.030
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1513
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.900
<v Speaker 2>Knocked me out right now then if that's what you want to go along with.</v>

1514
00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.350
<v Speaker 2>But it's just dumb.</v>

1515
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.221
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>

1516
00:40:54.221 --> 00:40:57.220
<v Speaker 2>and then recently someone dug up the whole Hector Lombard stuff again.</v>

1517
00:40:57.221 --> 00:40:57.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1518
00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1519
00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:58.613
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1520
00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:02.260
<v Speaker 2>And I thought that was done because we have a mutual friend through the gym and</v>

1521
00:41:02.261 --> 00:41:02.650
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

1522
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:02.801
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1523
00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:03.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1524
00:41:03.101 --> 00:41:03.581
<v Speaker 2>Hector,</v>

1525
00:41:03.581 --> 00:41:03.911
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

1526
00:41:03.911 --> 00:41:04.660
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

1527
00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Apologize for all the crap before.</v>

1528
00:41:06.251 --> 00:41:07.000
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1529
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:07.541
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

1530
00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:07.901
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1531
00:41:07.901 --> 00:41:10.810
<v Speaker 2>we never had a problem with Hector at CSW really?</v>

1532
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:11.501
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1533
00:41:11.501 --> 00:41:11.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1534
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.350
<v Speaker 2>even the night that Hector called me out at Bellator,</v>

1535
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:17.920
<v Speaker 2>I did the day before weigh ins.</v>

1536
00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:19.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm Hector,</v>

1537
00:41:19.031 --> 00:41:19.781
<v Speaker 2>how are you doing man?</v>

1538
00:41:19.781 --> 00:41:21.040
<v Speaker 2>I think you're going to do really great,</v>

1539
00:41:21.041 --> 00:41:21.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1540
00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:21.480
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1541
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:21.910
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

1542
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Still backing him up.</v>

1543
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.580
<v Speaker 2>And then only to have him say,</v>

1544
00:41:24.581 --> 00:41:24.761
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1545
00:41:24.761 --> 00:41:25.720
<v Speaker 2>I want to fight this guy.</v>

1546
00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck man?</v>

1547
00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.630
<v Speaker 2>He said down at the Wayne.</v>

1548
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:31.990
<v Speaker 2>When did say that after he won his fight at Bella [inaudible],</v>

1549
00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:32.843
<v Speaker 2>this is when he was the mill,</v>

1550
00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:33.723
<v Speaker 2>the champion it.</v>

1551
00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.780
<v Speaker 2>But who do you want to fight next to me?</v>

1552
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Like I want off fight Josh Barnett and what we want to fight me for?</v>

1553
00:41:39.351 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck dude come on and people the wrong way.</v>

1554
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.130
<v Speaker 2>You ruffling feathers.</v>

1555
00:41:43.131 --> 00:41:43.964
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing man?</v>

1556
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.571
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1557
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I will,</v>

1558
00:41:45.651 --> 00:41:48.230
<v Speaker 2>I will accept that I ruffle feathers.</v>

1559
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:49.400
<v Speaker 2>I rub people the wrong way.</v>

1560
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I will ruffle feathers,</v>

1561
00:41:52.431 --> 00:41:55.100
<v Speaker 2>especially in the case that I will call things like I see it.</v>

1562
00:41:55.101 --> 00:41:58.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't let bullshit slide and I have absolutely no,</v>

1563
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 2>I do not suffer fools.</v>

1564
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:03.800
<v Speaker 2>So if you come at me with a bunch of just ignorant,</v>

1565
00:42:03.801 --> 00:42:04.401
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>

1566
00:42:04.401 --> 00:42:04.821
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1567
00:42:04.821 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 2>if you built your whole life,</v>

1568
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:10.010
<v Speaker 2>this whole construct around who you are and what you do based on a lie,</v>

1569
00:42:10.011 --> 00:42:11.680
<v Speaker 2>based on something fall,</v>

1570
00:42:11.681 --> 00:42:12.620
<v Speaker 2>something bullshit.</v>

1571
00:42:12.621 --> 00:42:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Some I'm just,</v>

1572
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:17.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to accept that and I'm not going to respect you if you don't have</v>

1573
00:42:17.751 --> 00:42:18.620
<v Speaker 2>to be the best.</v>

1574
00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.000
<v Speaker 2>You could be the worst.</v>

1575
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:21.470
<v Speaker 2>But if you're an honest person,</v>

1576
00:42:21.471 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 2>you're a real person,</v>

1577
00:42:22.341 --> 00:42:24.560
<v Speaker 2>then I don't give a shit that's not,</v>

1578
00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:28.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really impressed by people that can try to portray being something that</v>

1579
00:42:28.971 --> 00:42:31.700
<v Speaker 2>they aren't or make themselves into something that they aren't.</v>

1580
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm more interested in the people who are exactly who they are and that's fine</v>

1581
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:39.110
<v Speaker 2>and understanding that they have weaknesses and strengths and being able to grow</v>

1582
00:42:39.111 --> 00:42:43.130
<v Speaker 2>and and be a person of integrity and being a person that is true to who they are</v>

1583
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:44.203
<v Speaker 2>and true to me.</v>

1584
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.570
<v Speaker 2>So that will cause a lot of issues with folks,</v>

1585
00:42:47.571 --> 00:42:50.210
<v Speaker 2>especially the fact is ideal in entertainment,</v>

1586
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.830
<v Speaker 2>whether it be fighting,</v>

1587
00:42:51.831 --> 00:42:53.300
<v Speaker 2>are they acting or anything that I do.</v>

1588
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.440
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of false bravado.</v>

1589
00:42:55.441 --> 00:42:56.900
<v Speaker 2>A lot of made up,</v>

1590
00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.033
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1591
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1592
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.480
<v Speaker 2>machismo posturing,</v>

1593
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.811
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1594
00:43:02.811 --> 00:43:03.171
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1595
00:43:03.171 --> 00:43:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Hector,</v>

1596
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:04.161
<v Speaker 2>the first time,</v>

1597
00:43:04.161 --> 00:43:09.161
<v Speaker 2>so he says the reason that we had beef was because he broke my nose the first</v>

1598
00:43:09.441 --> 00:43:11.690
<v Speaker 2>day of sparring and I hated him ever.</v>

1599
00:43:11.691 --> 00:43:12.530
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

1600
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.850
<v Speaker 2>I hated him ever since then.</v>

1601
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:16.550
<v Speaker 2>And that's not fucking true either.</v>

1602
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.040
<v Speaker 2>The first day he ever showed up at CSW,</v>

1603
00:43:19.041 --> 00:43:20.330
<v Speaker 2>he'd come up from team quest.</v>

1604
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.560
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't going to train there anymore.</v>

1605
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:22.371
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1606
00:43:22.371 --> 00:43:23.204
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1607
00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I think he still hates Dan Henderson.</v>

1608
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1609
00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.990
<v Speaker 2>why does it hit Dan Henderson?</v>

1610
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:28.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that whatever.</v>

1611
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:29.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1612
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.080
<v Speaker 2>I never asked.</v>

1613
00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:30.770
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1614
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:31.041
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1615
00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:31.380
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1616
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:31.821
<v Speaker 2>he sucks,</v>

1617
00:43:31.821 --> 00:43:32.120
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1618
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.860
<v Speaker 2>He's a Jerky Myeong whatever,</v>

1619
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:34.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1620
00:43:34.941 --> 00:43:35.220
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1621
00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.170
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get into it,</v>

1622
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:40.190
<v Speaker 2>but the first thing he came and sparred was actually one of the best days we</v>

1623
00:43:40.191 --> 00:43:42.560
<v Speaker 2>ever had with sparring because he got in the ring.</v>

1624
00:43:42.561 --> 00:43:44.120
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't trying to murder everybody.</v>

1625
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.050
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1626
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1627
00:43:45.201 --> 00:43:47.870
<v Speaker 2>I fucking hit Victor Rolls Autumn and took his knee and he's just like,</v>

1628
00:43:47.871 --> 00:43:48.471
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>

1629
00:43:48.471 --> 00:43:49.071
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

1630
00:43:49.071 --> 00:43:49.820
<v Speaker 2>How did you do?</v>

1631
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:50.810
<v Speaker 2>We're all having a good time,</v>

1632
00:43:50.811 --> 00:43:52.250
<v Speaker 2>but I'm tapping them out and taking them down,</v>

1633
00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.180
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1634
00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.620
<v Speaker 2>But there's no animosity.</v>

1635
00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:55.680
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1636
00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.190
<v Speaker 2>everybody's training and training and training and he's always amping it up now.</v>

1637
00:43:58.191 --> 00:44:02.300
<v Speaker 2>And then at some point I show up at practice late and everyone's on the floor.</v>

1638
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.710
<v Speaker 2>Hecker doesn't have a partner.</v>

1639
00:44:03.711 --> 00:44:05.120
<v Speaker 2>So I just threw my shit on real quick.</v>

1640
00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:05.691
<v Speaker 2>No hand wraps,</v>

1641
00:44:05.691 --> 00:44:06.141
<v Speaker 2>no nothing.</v>

1642
00:44:06.141 --> 00:44:07.040
<v Speaker 2>No one's going hard.</v>

1643
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm just going to jump in and start warming up.</v>

1644
00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:09.993
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1645
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:10.671
<v Speaker 2>Touch,</v>

1646
00:44:10.671 --> 00:44:11.001
<v Speaker 2>touch,</v>

1647
00:44:11.001 --> 00:44:11.301
<v Speaker 2>tap,</v>

1648
00:44:11.301 --> 00:44:12.134
<v Speaker 2>tap.</v>

1649
00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.071
<v Speaker 2>Oh boom.</v>

1650
00:44:13.071 --> 00:44:15.040
<v Speaker 2>He throws the biggest fucking punch he's gotten,</v>

1651
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:16.010
<v Speaker 2>tries to knock me out,</v>

1652
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:17.660
<v Speaker 2>starts my nose bleeding.</v>

1653
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:18.591
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going,</v>

1654
00:44:18.591 --> 00:44:19.730
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1655
00:44:19.731 --> 00:44:23.630
<v Speaker 2>So then it's all on for like 20 minutes and I put a giant egg on the side of his</v>

1656
00:44:23.631 --> 00:44:25.130
<v Speaker 2>head and shit and then pause.</v>

1657
00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.050
<v Speaker 2>And you basically had a fight.</v>

1658
00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.810
<v Speaker 2>It was broad it out and uh,</v>

1659
00:44:28.811 --> 00:44:29.230
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1660
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:29.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1661
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:30.080
<v Speaker 2>boxing,</v>

1662
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.510
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing and Paula finally called,</v>

1663
00:44:32.511 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 2>called an nine to it and it's fine.</v>

1664
00:44:34.141 --> 00:44:35.400
<v Speaker 2>And then later on,</v>

1665
00:44:35.401 --> 00:44:39.660
<v Speaker 2>at some point he sparring mighty moe and mighty moe drops him and Paul like,</v>

1666
00:44:39.661 --> 00:44:39.931
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1667
00:44:39.931 --> 00:44:40.230
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

1668
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.590
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1669
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:41.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1670
00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 2>lighten it up.</v>

1671
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Lighten it up.</v>

1672
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:43.261
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man,</v>

1673
00:44:43.261 --> 00:44:43.981
<v Speaker 2>I ain't scared of him.</v>

1674
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:45.300
<v Speaker 2>I ain't scared and mighty mo was like,</v>

1675
00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:45.871
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1676
00:44:45.871 --> 00:44:46.501
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

1677
00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:47.070
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1678
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't need this.</v>

1679
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:50.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to help you out.</v>

1680
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I already got x amount of cars and two houses,</v>

1681
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:53.934
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1682
00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:54.720
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1683
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't need this shit.</v>

1684
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.940
<v Speaker 2>I've already made money.</v>

1685
00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:59.430
<v Speaker 2>You're the one who's down here trying to crawl up the ranks.</v>

1686
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.481
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1687
00:45:00.481 --> 00:45:01.290
<v Speaker 2>why you,</v>

1688
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:02.490
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to get out of this?</v>

1689
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:06.360
<v Speaker 2>And so then things started getting a little worse here.</v>

1690
00:45:06.361 --> 00:45:08.130
<v Speaker 2>He started beating up on civilians,</v>

1691
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.320
<v Speaker 2>which is what I call like people that are not pros.</v>

1692
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.333
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1693
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:13.830
<v Speaker 2>and we would still spar and things like that here and there.</v>

1694
00:45:13.831 --> 00:45:15.540
<v Speaker 2>But I always knew that with Hector,</v>

1695
00:45:15.541 --> 00:45:16.680
<v Speaker 2>he was always going to go hard.</v>

1696
00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:18.030
<v Speaker 2>You never had a light?</v>

1697
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Not because he couldn't,</v>

1698
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.153
<v Speaker 2>but he wouldn't.</v>

1699
00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:20.731
<v Speaker 2>And you guys,</v>

1700
00:45:20.731 --> 00:45:22.770
<v Speaker 2>after you'd gone hard for 20 minutes,</v>

1701
00:45:22.771 --> 00:45:24.620
<v Speaker 2>you basically fought it out for 20 minutes.</v>

1702
00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:25.291
<v Speaker 2>I was done with it.</v>

1703
00:45:25.291 --> 00:45:25.720
<v Speaker 2>I'd never,</v>

1704
00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.553
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't mad at him.</v>

1705
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.490
<v Speaker 2>So you were perfectly fine with sparring him after that.</v>

1706
00:45:29.491 --> 00:45:30.330
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1707
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.360
<v Speaker 2>he made it clear who he was going to be in the gym.</v>

1708
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1709
00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:34.651
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

1710
00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:34.891
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1711
00:45:34.891 --> 00:45:36.940
<v Speaker 2>one time we had a,</v>

1712
00:45:36.941 --> 00:45:37.830
<v Speaker 2>a grappling tournament.</v>

1713
00:45:37.831 --> 00:45:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I drove him out with me so we could all hang out,</v>

1714
00:45:39.961 --> 00:45:40.980
<v Speaker 2>everyone could be together.</v>

1715
00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:41.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1716
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:46.430
<v Speaker 2>he came out to this fight out in palm desert where we had some guys fighting and</v>

1717
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:47.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1718
00:45:47.371 --> 00:45:47.641
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

1719
00:45:47.641 --> 00:45:49.010
<v Speaker 2>he was a part of everything with,</v>

1720
00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.040
<v Speaker 2>with part of the team,</v>

1721
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:53.280
<v Speaker 2>but we knew that he was unstable,</v>

1722
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:54.810
<v Speaker 2>but we knew what to expect.</v>

1723
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:59.370
<v Speaker 2>So Bob Lou beat up on him one time in the gym because he didn't like him at all</v>

1724
00:45:59.371 --> 00:46:00.270
<v Speaker 2>because he was,</v>

1725
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.450
<v Speaker 2>he would beat up on because Hector would take liberties of people,</v>

1726
00:46:03.451 --> 00:46:03.810
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1727
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:04.210
<v Speaker 2>That he,</v>

1728
00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:05.130
<v Speaker 2>that Babaloo felt like,</v>

1729
00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:05.251
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1730
00:46:05.251 --> 00:46:06.084
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't do that.</v>

1731
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:06.961
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1732
00:46:06.961 --> 00:46:07.794
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1733
00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:08.640
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1734
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.140
<v Speaker 2>then the last time we sparred,</v>

1735
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:11.543
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1736
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.550
<v Speaker 2>I get on top of him and I,</v>

1737
00:46:14.551 --> 00:46:15.870
<v Speaker 2>and I'm working him over pretty good,</v>

1738
00:46:15.871 --> 00:46:17.130
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not trying to kill the guy.</v>

1739
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:18.750
<v Speaker 2>And he freaks out and he's like,</v>

1740
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:19.660
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1741
00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:20.071
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>

1742
00:46:20.071 --> 00:46:20.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>

1743
00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:20.631
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1744
00:46:20.631 --> 00:46:21.121
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired,</v>

1745
00:46:21.121 --> 00:46:21.331
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1746
00:46:21.331 --> 00:46:22.141
<v Speaker 2>Why is like,</v>

1747
00:46:22.141 --> 00:46:22.321
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1748
00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:26.190
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean you to I do every day you go hard and try to kill people in the</v>

1749
00:46:26.191 --> 00:46:27.024
<v Speaker 2>one day.</v>

1750
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:28.470
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to go hard,</v>

1751
00:46:28.471 --> 00:46:29.221
<v Speaker 2>you don't say anything,</v>

1752
00:46:29.221 --> 00:46:32.100
<v Speaker 2>but everybody just expects us what's going to be bright.</v>

1753
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:32.970
<v Speaker 2>And so he says,</v>

1754
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:33.121
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1755
00:46:33.121 --> 00:46:34.760
<v Speaker 2>and this one day I got on top of him,</v>

1756
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:36.180
<v Speaker 2>beat him near within an inch of his life.</v>

1757
00:46:36.181 --> 00:46:36.451
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1758
00:46:36.451 --> 00:46:37.350
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do that.</v>

1759
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:38.760
<v Speaker 2>I know I didn't do that.</v>

1760
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:39.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1761
00:46:39.001 --> 00:46:39.390
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

1762
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:40.890
<v Speaker 2>I pinned him and you know,</v>

1763
00:46:40.891 --> 00:46:41.400
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1764
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.530
<v Speaker 2>I was leather and m but not hurting the guy,</v>

1765
00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:43.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1766
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:44.783
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1767
00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:45.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1768
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.430
<v Speaker 2>he thought he was going to die or something.</v>

1769
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.621
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1770
00:46:46.621 --> 00:46:47.454
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna,</v>

1771
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:48.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna do that to you.</v>

1772
00:46:48.661 --> 00:46:49.320
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1773
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.153
<v Speaker 2>it's just training.</v>

1774
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:51.263
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1775
00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:53.730
<v Speaker 2>now it's like this thing again,</v>

1776
00:46:53.731 --> 00:46:54.100
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1777
00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:54.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1778
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.220
<v Speaker 2>you didn't beat my ass in the gym.</v>

1779
00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:57.960
<v Speaker 2>You're an incredible fighter.</v>

1780
00:46:57.961 --> 00:46:58.410
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1781
00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:00.660
<v Speaker 2>you're a better fighter than you even understand.</v>

1782
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:01.650
<v Speaker 2>Hector Lombard,</v>

1783
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:04.200
<v Speaker 2>if his head was right,</v>

1784
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.510
<v Speaker 2>would be untouchable.</v>

1785
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.550
<v Speaker 2>He is one of the most gifted,</v>

1786
00:47:08.551 --> 00:47:09.301
<v Speaker 2>strong,</v>

1787
00:47:09.301 --> 00:47:14.130
<v Speaker 2>fast at throw aside the fact that he just got popped for steroids.</v>

1788
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:15.840
<v Speaker 2>Even with,</v>

1789
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.680
<v Speaker 2>even with it,</v>

1790
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:18.210
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

1791
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.260
<v Speaker 2>you could find him,</v>

1792
00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:24.090
<v Speaker 2>his fucking his peers and give them all the same shit or different shit.</v>

1793
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:24.953
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

1794
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:26.510
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to move.</v>

1795
00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Have the strength and the speed.</v>

1796
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.590
<v Speaker 2>Like Hector's Hector's unreal.</v>

1797
00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Hector's should be undefeated,</v>

1798
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:34.960
<v Speaker 2>the Hector's a headcase and that's why,</v>

1799
00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:35.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1800
00:47:35.561 --> 00:47:40.210
<v Speaker 2>he'll never fully ascend to the top of the throne or really keep it if he can</v>

1801
00:47:40.211 --> 00:47:45.211
<v Speaker 2>get there because he doesn't understand what it is that he has and how to use it</v>

1802
00:47:46.001 --> 00:47:46.570
<v Speaker 2>best,</v>

1803
00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:47.530
<v Speaker 2>but he is amazing.</v>

1804
00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>

1805
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.050
<v Speaker 2>That dude gnarly.</v>

1806
00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:50.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1807
00:47:50.441 --> 00:47:51.460
<v Speaker 2>He's a super athlete.</v>

1808
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:52.510
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about that.</v>

1809
00:47:52.511 --> 00:47:54.820
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anybody ragdoll Jake shields like that.</v>

1810
00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.290
<v Speaker 2>He could judge shields around.</v>

1811
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.570
<v Speaker 2>He could do that to anybody in his weight division.</v>

1812
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:03.760
<v Speaker 2>He can he can he now could somebody have a counter for some something?</v>

1813
00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:04.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1814
00:48:04.271 --> 00:48:05.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying he's,</v>

1815
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:06.430
<v Speaker 2>he's invincible,</v>

1816
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:11.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying that what he possesses and athleticism and skill sets.</v>

1817
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:12.850
<v Speaker 2>He's actually a good leg lock her too.</v>

1818
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.470
<v Speaker 2>You won't see them necessarily go for it,</v>

1819
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.090
<v Speaker 2>but he is a good leg locker.</v>

1820
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:16.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1821
00:48:16.511 --> 00:48:19.000
<v Speaker 2>There's a video of him in a grappling tournament.</v>

1822
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Breaks that guy's leg.</v>

1823
00:48:20.141 --> 00:48:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1824
00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:23.110
<v Speaker 2>it's loud but a carrot and he's got,</v>

1825
00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:25.690
<v Speaker 2>he's got even more skills than he displays.</v>

1826
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:26.620
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1827
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1828
00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:28.090
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be able to put it together.</v>

1829
00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 2>But isn't that part of the beauty of MMA is that it is this weird thing that you</v>

1830
00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:32.890
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1831
00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:37.780
<v Speaker 2>you can't just be a super athlete because there's other super athletes too.</v>

1832
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:42.610
<v Speaker 2>You can't just be a technical guy cause there's other guys that are technical</v>

1833
00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:43.240
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1834
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.560
<v Speaker 2>There's so many variables.</v>

1835
00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:45.423
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1836
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.580
<v Speaker 2>And you could be the best athlete out there.</v>

1837
00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:52.150
<v Speaker 2>I know I fought people that were bigger and stronger than me and faster and I've</v>

1838
00:48:52.151 --> 00:48:55.250
<v Speaker 2>beaten them before and it wasn't because I went and I fought there.</v>

1839
00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Their speed with my speed or,</v>

1840
00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:59.440
<v Speaker 2>or use my strength against their strength.</v>

1841
00:48:59.441 --> 00:48:59.651
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1842
00:48:59.651 --> 00:49:03.700
<v Speaker 2>I found a way to bypass those things or to put them in such a way that they</v>

1843
00:49:03.701 --> 00:49:08.701
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't even apply strength or speed it where they should,</v>

1844
00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.080
<v Speaker 2>they don't even understand that,</v>

1845
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.760
<v Speaker 2>that it's still available to them.</v>

1846
00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just that they don't understand the position.</v>

1847
00:49:15.281 --> 00:49:16.540
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand what's going on.</v>

1848
00:49:16.541 --> 00:49:20.320
<v Speaker 2>They don't even realize what opportunities are there for them.</v>

1849
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:20.831
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1850
00:49:20.831 --> 00:49:24.100
<v Speaker 3>isn't it almost impossible unless you spend decades in martial arts,</v>

1851
00:49:24.101 --> 00:49:28.690
<v Speaker 3>it's all almost impossible to have all the skills and all the knowledge at your</v>

1852
00:49:28.691 --> 00:49:29.261
<v Speaker 3>disposal.</v>

1853
00:49:29.261 --> 00:49:29.651
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

1854
00:49:29.651 --> 00:49:32.470
<v Speaker 3>it's such a deep pool of information to draw from.</v>

1855
00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.373
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

1856
00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:34.730
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1857
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:39.380
<v Speaker 2>if you want to have the biggest toolbox out there,</v>

1858
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.140
<v Speaker 2>then you have to spend the time to do it.</v>

1859
00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:46.070
<v Speaker 2>When the coaches are done coaching you and you've left practice,</v>

1860
00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.570
<v Speaker 2>how do you spend your time?</v>

1861
00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:51.740
<v Speaker 2>Are you watching video not just on your opponent but just watching video on</v>

1862
00:49:51.741 --> 00:49:56.741
<v Speaker 2>things for fun or or to beat or two to take a look at something and break it</v>

1863
00:49:56.991 --> 00:50:00.830
<v Speaker 2>down and make it yours and in a very highly technical aspect?</v>

1864
00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Or are you a shadow boxing to make sure that the work on keeping that jab</v>

1865
00:50:05.481 --> 00:50:05.991
<v Speaker 2>inside?</v>

1866
00:50:05.991 --> 00:50:08.240
<v Speaker 2>Are you thinking about the things that you've been working on?</v>

1867
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Are you thinking about every mentally drilling like gable says,</v>

1868
00:50:11.721 --> 00:50:14.450
<v Speaker 2>are you sitting there going through shot after shot,</v>

1869
00:50:14.451 --> 00:50:15.051
<v Speaker 2>after shot,</v>

1870
00:50:15.051 --> 00:50:17.060
<v Speaker 2>set up after set up after set up in your head?</v>

1871
00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Are you having a garbage truck come through in the signal right now?</v>

1872
00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:27.320

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.110
<v Speaker 3>Marina Shaffir,</v>

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:49.940
<v Speaker 3>Victor Henry show.</v>

1892
00:50:49.941 --> 00:50:50.070
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1893
00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:53.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm a moto Coleen Schneider Shana.</v>

1894
00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:55.010
<v Speaker 3>And if you wanted to start it,</v>

1895
00:50:55.011 --> 00:50:57.260
<v Speaker 3>say if you're going to start from scratch,</v>

1896
00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:02.090
<v Speaker 3>if you were going to develop a program and take a athletes that had never fought</v>

1897
00:51:02.091 --> 00:51:02.810
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

1898
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:05.150
<v Speaker 3>never had any martial arts experience whatsoever,</v>

1899
00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:07.310
<v Speaker 3>and turn them into professional,</v>

1900
00:51:07.311 --> 00:51:08.360
<v Speaker 3>mixed martial arts fighters.</v>

1901
00:51:08.361 --> 00:51:09.280
<v Speaker 3>If you had a,</v>

1902
00:51:09.281 --> 00:51:09.510
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1903
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:11.060
<v Speaker 3>a curriculum as it were,</v>

1904
00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:12.410
<v Speaker 3>how would you start that off?</v>

1905
00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1906
00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:13.831
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

1907
00:51:13.831 --> 00:51:14.850
<v Speaker 2>first things first.</v>

1908
00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:17.760
<v Speaker 2>What do you possess up top your brain.</v>

1909
00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:18.623
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1910
00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:23.690
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have the type of mind that can be that dedicated,</v>

1911
00:51:23.821 --> 00:51:24.930
<v Speaker 2>that obsessive that,</v>

1912
00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:25.860
<v Speaker 2>that can,</v>

1913
00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:29.910
<v Speaker 2>that can be easy going and you need to be easy going and be completely unmovable</v>

1914
00:51:29.911 --> 00:51:30.744
<v Speaker 2>when you need to be.</v>

1915
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:31.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1916
00:51:31.111 --> 00:51:33.780
<v Speaker 2>That unshaking and unfettered confidence.</v>

1917
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:36.200
<v Speaker 3>And how would you develop that in a person?</v>

1918
00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.240
<v Speaker 3>Is that something you either have or you don't have,</v>

1919
00:51:38.241 --> 00:51:39.680
<v Speaker 3>or is it something that you could develop?</v>

1920
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:40.860
<v Speaker 2>You can develop it,</v>

1921
00:51:40.861 --> 00:51:41.370
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1922
00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:43.110
<v Speaker 2>I truly believe that for the most part,</v>

1923
00:51:43.111 --> 00:51:45.810
<v Speaker 2>it's something that you are born with the ability to do.</v>

1924
00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1925
00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.011
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1926
00:51:47.011 --> 00:51:50.940
<v Speaker 2>you give them adversity right off the bat and you give them struggles.</v>

1927
00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:54.420
<v Speaker 2>You give them things that will confuse them on purpose.</v>

1928
00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:56.040
<v Speaker 2>And you see,</v>

1929
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:57.240
<v Speaker 2>how do they deal with that?</v>

1930
00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Do they quit and they fold it in and they throw a fit about it and they throw a</v>

1931
00:52:01.501 --> 00:52:02.340
<v Speaker 2>temper tantrum?</v>

1932
00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:03.700
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>

1933
00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:08.880
<v Speaker 2>because what you have to do to get to the end goal is really irrelevant.</v>

1934
00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Getting to the end goal is what's important.</v>

1935
00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:16.490
<v Speaker 2>So if you had to fucking do coffee runs for two weeks in a row,</v>

1936
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:20.641
<v Speaker 2>if that was all,</v>

1937
00:52:20.641 --> 00:52:20.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1938
00:52:20.911 --> 00:52:21.361
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

1939
00:52:21.361 --> 00:52:24.420
<v Speaker 2>What is that in the length of what your career would be in length of what your</v>

1940
00:52:24.421 --> 00:52:25.060
<v Speaker 2>training would be?</v>

1941
00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:25.601
<v Speaker 3>Coffee runs.</v>

1942
00:52:25.601 --> 00:52:26.310
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

1943
00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:27.220
<v Speaker 3>When one said,</v>

1944
00:52:27.221 --> 00:52:27.670
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1945
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:29.110
<v Speaker 3>Josh wants you to go get them coffee.</v>

1946
00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:29.500
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1947
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:30.790
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck is that going to help anybody?</v>

1948
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:33.940
<v Speaker 3>I just made it up because I've been drinking coffee,</v>

1949
00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:34.870
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1950
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:35.411
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1951
00:52:35.411 --> 00:52:36.430
<v Speaker 3>if that was it,</v>

1952
00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:37.330
<v Speaker 3>just to see them,</v>

1953
00:52:37.331 --> 00:52:37.541
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1954
00:52:37.541 --> 00:52:37.780
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1955
00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:38.680
<v Speaker 3>I want to go train.</v>

1956
00:52:38.681 --> 00:52:40.210
<v Speaker 3>I want to see what they do.</v>

1957
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.541
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1958
00:52:40.541 --> 00:52:43.660
<v Speaker 3>don't you think that you're dealing with people like,</v>

1959
00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:43.961
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1960
00:52:43.961 --> 00:52:47.740
<v Speaker 3>some people will come to the table with a certain amount of mental toughness,</v>

1961
00:52:47.741 --> 00:52:49.000
<v Speaker 3>a certain amount of discipline,</v>

1962
00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:50.390
<v Speaker 3>a certain amount of,</v>

1963
00:52:50.391 --> 00:52:50.651
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1964
00:52:50.651 --> 00:52:53.110
<v Speaker 3>the ability to overcome adversity and some people won't.</v>

1965
00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.780
<v Speaker 3>And you're only going to take the ones that will,</v>

1966
00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:56.040
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>

1967
00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:59.680
<v Speaker 3>is it possible to take someone who's almost essentially a blank slate</v>

1968
00:52:59.681 --> 00:53:04.681
<v Speaker 3>athletically and turn them into someone who could understand what's going on in</v>

1969
00:53:06.461 --> 00:53:07.294
<v Speaker 3>their mind?</v>

1970
00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:07.511
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1971
00:53:07.511 --> 00:53:09.400
<v Speaker 3>do you believe in like mental training?</v>

1972
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:09.940
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1973
00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:10.880
<v Speaker 3>it is possible.</v>

1974
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:11.641
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1975
00:53:11.641 --> 00:53:14.520
<v Speaker 2>they would have to exhibit those characteristics.</v>

1976
00:53:14.521 --> 00:53:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Not through an athletic window per se,</v>

1977
00:53:16.531 --> 00:53:19.440
<v Speaker 2>but just through a determination standpoint,</v>

1978
00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:20.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1979
00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:20.843
<v Speaker 2>just through,</v>

1980
00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:22.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1981
00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:26.640
<v Speaker 2>it's like the reason why pro-wrestling gyms and back in the day,</v>

1982
00:53:26.641 --> 00:53:27.960
<v Speaker 2>or even even currently,</v>

1983
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:28.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1984
00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:28.990
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1985
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:30.330
<v Speaker 2>in Japan especially,</v>

1986
00:53:30.331 --> 00:53:32.090
<v Speaker 2>and the lion's den and the,</v>

1987
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:33.210
<v Speaker 2>they had tryouts.</v>

1988
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I had to go through a tryout.</v>

1989
00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:37.350
<v Speaker 2>I beat to profilers,</v>

1990
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:41.550
<v Speaker 2>my first two fights and I still had to go through a tryout.</v>

1991
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:43.290
<v Speaker 2>I still had sparring.</v>

1992
00:53:43.291 --> 00:53:44.124
<v Speaker 2>I still had,</v>

1993
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I had to have a meeting with the coaches before I could join AMCs fight team</v>

1994
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:51.060
<v Speaker 2>because just winning,</v>

1995
00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:51.331
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1996
00:53:51.331 --> 00:53:53.130
<v Speaker 2>even being a good fighter wasn't enough.</v>

1997
00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:55.170
<v Speaker 2>They needed to see what does this guy made of?</v>

1998
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Is He coachable?</v>

1999
00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.073
<v Speaker 2>Is He,</v>

2000
00:53:58.530 --> 00:53:59.363
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2001
00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:04.790
<v Speaker 2>is he have the mental capacity to be in this environment and excel?</v>

2002
00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:06.840
<v Speaker 2>Can he,</v>

2003
00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.870
<v Speaker 2>can he be one of those people that what we instill in him,</v>

2004
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:11.243
<v Speaker 2>we'll stick.</v>

2005
00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:11.541
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2006
00:54:11.541 --> 00:54:13.010
<v Speaker 3>that was what I was kind of getting to,</v>

2007
00:54:13.011 --> 00:54:16.250
<v Speaker 3>is there a way you could develop a mental curriculum?</v>

2008
00:54:16.251 --> 00:54:20.150
<v Speaker 3>Because it seems like that is one of the biggest parts of,</v>

2009
00:54:20.151 --> 00:54:23.180
<v Speaker 3>of competing one of the biggest parts of succeeding.</v>

2010
00:54:23.181 --> 00:54:25.280
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not tripping over your own Dick.</v>

2011
00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:25.551
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2012
00:54:25.551 --> 00:54:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Which a lot of people do in all sorts of things in life.</v>

2013
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:29.300
<v Speaker 3>You see with standup Comedians,</v>

2014
00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:30.800
<v Speaker 3>you see it with musicians,</v>

2015
00:54:30.801 --> 00:54:32.000
<v Speaker 3>you see with authors,</v>

2016
00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:35.780
<v Speaker 3>there's people that just don't fucking do the work or they fuck up or they don't</v>

2017
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:38.420
<v Speaker 3>fall through or they take too much time off.</v>

2018
00:54:38.421 --> 00:54:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Or w w the mental aspect of success,</v>

2019
00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:42.920
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2020
00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.870
<v Speaker 3>the idea of finding a goal,</v>

2021
00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:49.220
<v Speaker 3>figuring out how to get to that goal and then avoiding anything that trips you</v>

2022
00:54:49.221 --> 00:54:50.054
<v Speaker 3>up along the way.</v>

2023
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2024
00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:51.751
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2025
00:54:51.751 --> 00:54:55.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about building a curriculum that's one size fits all because</v>

2026
00:54:55.801 --> 00:54:56.730
<v Speaker 2>everybody's a little different.</v>

2027
00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:57.571
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2028
00:54:57.571 --> 00:54:57.811
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2029
00:54:57.811 --> 00:54:58.201
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2030
00:54:58.201 --> 00:55:00.780
<v Speaker 2>of the difficulties that you,</v>

2031
00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:02.250
<v Speaker 2>that you named are,</v>

2032
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:03.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2033
00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.830
<v Speaker 2>a failing or,</v>

2034
00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:05.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2035
00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:09.190
<v Speaker 2>not trying to wear some of these posey yeah.</v>

2036
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.261
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it is.</v>

2037
00:55:13.261 --> 00:55:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's very tight and small.</v>

2038
00:55:14.971 --> 00:55:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you just never know what you're getting at.</v>

2039
00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:19.360
<v Speaker 3>I met Nikki said in rocky.</v>

2040
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2041
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2042
00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:21.293
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>

2043
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:22.943
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2044
00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:25.190
<v Speaker 2>some of those things are okay.</v>

2045
00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Failing is okay.</v>

2046
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Failing is okay.</v>

2047
00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.190
<v Speaker 3>As long as you learn from it,</v>

2048
00:55:29.191 --> 00:55:31.040
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the best motivators ever.</v>

2049
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:35.520
<v Speaker 2>What's not okay is distractions not doing the work.</v>

2050
00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

2051
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:41.040
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference between not being successful because it just isn't learned</v>

2052
00:55:43.231 --> 00:55:43.590
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

2053
00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Isn't,</v>

2054
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:44.430
<v Speaker 2>isn't.</v>

2055
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:46.170
<v Speaker 2>You haven't developed the capability yet.</v>

2056
00:55:46.171 --> 00:55:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're just not quite strong enough.</v>

2057
00:55:47.731 --> 00:55:48.564
<v Speaker 2>Quite fat.</v>

2058
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.411
<v Speaker 2>Things like that.</v>

2059
00:55:49.411 --> 00:55:54.411
<v Speaker 2>Things that you in time can be learned and understood and grown from.</v>

2060
00:55:56.850 --> 00:56:00.300
<v Speaker 2>And then there's shitting the bed by not putting the work in,</v>

2061
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:02.280
<v Speaker 2>by having the wrong attitude,</v>

2062
00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.121
<v Speaker 2>by showing up,</v>

2063
00:56:03.121 --> 00:56:04.230
<v Speaker 2>trying to win all the time,</v>

2064
00:56:04.231 --> 00:56:05.580
<v Speaker 2>letting your ego get in the way.</v>

2065
00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:06.713
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2066
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.801
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

2067
00:56:07.801 --> 00:56:09.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you want as a coach as,</v>

2068
00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:10.190
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2069
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:13.440
<v Speaker 2>Not even just as a coast was take the coaching aspect out of it because this</v>

2070
00:56:13.441 --> 00:56:17.400
<v Speaker 2>applies to life as someone that's going to have somebody else apprentice under</v>

2071
00:56:17.401 --> 00:56:22.401
<v Speaker 2>them as somebody that has the ability to instill knowledge and understanding</v>

2072
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.830
<v Speaker 2>towards something that somebody else wants to work towards.</v>

2073
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:32.700
<v Speaker 2>That person who needs to learn this stuff has to have the right head.</v>

2074
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:33.791
<v Speaker 2>My old coach,</v>

2075
00:56:33.791 --> 00:56:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Billy Robinson said,</v>

2076
00:56:34.721 --> 00:56:36.460
<v Speaker 2>you need to learn how to learn,</v>

2077
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:37.900
<v Speaker 2>and that's a fucking fact.</v>

2078
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:39.250
<v Speaker 2>And so the coat,</v>

2079
00:56:39.251 --> 00:56:44.251
<v Speaker 2>one of the mentors jobs is to try and help guide this person to teach them how</v>

2080
00:56:44.441 --> 00:56:44.921
<v Speaker 2>to learn.</v>

2081
00:56:44.921 --> 00:56:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Because once they learn,</v>

2082
00:56:45.971 --> 00:56:46.271
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

2083
00:56:46.271 --> 00:56:50.290
<v Speaker 2>it's the stupid old analogy of give a man a fish he'll eat today.</v>

2084
00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Teach a man to fish.</v>

2085
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:52.630
<v Speaker 2>He'll eat for a lifetime.</v>

2086
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:54.760
<v Speaker 2>It is fucking that simple.</v>

2087
00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:56.950
<v Speaker 2>When broken down to its smallest pieces,</v>

2088
00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.820
<v Speaker 2>you have to learn how to fish and you learn how to fish.</v>

2089
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.440
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if I tell you,</v>

2090
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.101
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2091
00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:06.280
<v Speaker 2>well I want you to use your jab to score on this guy's chin.</v>

2092
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:11.470
<v Speaker 2>You will figure out the way you need to use your jab to score on that guy's</v>

2093
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:12.040
<v Speaker 2>chin.</v>

2094
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.680
<v Speaker 2>You will make the jab that you possessed,</v>

2095
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.380
<v Speaker 2>the most effective jab you have ever known</v>

2096
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:20.080
<v Speaker 1>because you understand,</v>

2097
00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:21.340
<v Speaker 1>you know how to fish.</v>

2098
00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:25.750
<v Speaker 1>You're not sitting there getting pissed off because you don't like the fact that</v>

2099
00:57:25.751 --> 00:57:27.850
<v Speaker 1>you didn't hit him every time or you didn't.</v>

2100
00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:28.440
<v Speaker 1>You're you're,</v>

2101
00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:29.273
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2102
00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.820
<v Speaker 1>you're focusing on the wrong things.</v>

2103
00:57:30.821 --> 00:57:33.220
<v Speaker 1>You're too busy trying to win instead of trying to learn.</v>

2104
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Once you learn,</v>

2105
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:35.193
<v Speaker 1>you'll win.</v>

2106
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.850
<v Speaker 1>If he tried to win all the time,</v>

2107
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.691
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fail.</v>

2108
00:57:37.691 --> 00:57:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Eventually does a big,</v>

2109
00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:40.420
<v Speaker 1>that's a big problem in Jujitsu.</v>

2110
00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Marcello Garcia talks about that a lot.</v>

2111
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:46.660
<v Speaker 1>He says that you have to open yourself up and training and you can't worry about</v>

2112
00:57:46.661 --> 00:57:47.290
<v Speaker 1>being tapped.</v>

2113
00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

2114
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Being tapped as a part of the game.</v>

2115
00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Get tapped and just move on.</v>

2116
00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:51.873
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

2117
00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:52.410
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2118
00:57:52.410 --> 00:57:55.710
<v Speaker 1>It's what's most important is that you open up your game and then in open,</v>

2119
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:58.690
<v Speaker 1>instead of being like super defensive and never taking any chances trying to</v>

2120
00:57:58.691 --> 00:57:58.990
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>

2121
00:57:58.990 --> 00:57:59.560
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

2122
00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:00.610
<v Speaker 1>you don't learn because you don't,</v>

2123
00:58:00.611 --> 00:58:01.450
<v Speaker 1>you don't get tapped.</v>

2124
00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:04.870
<v Speaker 1>But you don't learn Jack Shit and there's always those guys like a,</v>

2125
00:58:04.871 --> 00:58:05.890
<v Speaker 1>every gym has that.</v>

2126
00:58:05.891 --> 00:58:06.131
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

2127
00:58:06.131 --> 00:58:07.330
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible to tap.</v>

2128
00:58:07.331 --> 00:58:08.530
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't fucking tap anybody.</v>

2129
00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2130
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.731
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2131
00:58:09.731 --> 00:58:10.300
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2132
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:11.500
<v Speaker 1>and what?</v>

2133
00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:11.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2134
00:58:11.771 --> 00:58:14.650
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing that as a mentor,</v>

2135
00:58:14.651 --> 00:58:16.390
<v Speaker 2>as a coach or whatever you want to call it,</v>

2136
00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:20.700
<v Speaker 2>that you have to look for is not the person is there's always the person that's</v>

2137
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:21.543
<v Speaker 2>just fresh.</v>

2138
00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:22.683
<v Speaker 1>The boat,</v>

2139
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:23.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2140
00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:24.400
<v Speaker 1>they just fell off the turnip truck,</v>

2141
00:58:24.401 --> 00:58:24.910
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2142
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:25.743
<v Speaker 1>Just getting into it.</v>

2143
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.633
<v Speaker 1>Turn up trucks,</v>

2144
00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:27.370
<v Speaker 1>turn up trucks.</v>

2145
00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:28.130
<v Speaker 1>That's an old one.</v>

2146
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:28.963
<v Speaker 1>That's old school.</v>

2147
00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:29.831
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2148
00:58:29.831 --> 00:58:30.670
<v Speaker 1>the school is stable.</v>

2149
00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:33.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's turnip trucks that go through those feelings all the time.</v>

2150
00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:33.761
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2151
00:58:33.761 --> 00:58:34.970
<v Speaker 1>they're all about condoms over there.</v>

2152
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:41.030
<v Speaker 1>There one turnip truck for the whole entire state of California.</v>

2153
00:58:41.031 --> 00:58:41.750
<v Speaker 1>It's organic.</v>

2154
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:43.330
<v Speaker 1>It is organic to turn traits.</v>

2155
00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:44.323
<v Speaker 1>Gluten free.</v>

2156
00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Gluten free turnip.</v>

2157
00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2158
00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:51.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm not worried about booting anymore mean either sugar and gluten,</v>

2159
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.370
<v Speaker 1>but that's what the gluten issue is.</v>

2160
00:58:54.371 --> 00:58:55.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I'm,</v>

2161
00:58:55.960 --> 00:59:00.910
<v Speaker 1>the real issue I believe with gluten is that gluten is all sugar.</v>

2162
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're not dot gluten,</v>

2163
00:59:02.831 --> 00:59:04.450
<v Speaker 1>but gluten containing products.</v>

2164
00:59:04.451 --> 00:59:05.380
<v Speaker 1>If you have a lot of bread,</v>

2165
00:59:05.381 --> 00:59:06.280
<v Speaker 1>if you have a lot of pasta,</v>

2166
00:59:06.281 --> 00:59:06.761
<v Speaker 1>a lot of sugar,</v>

2167
00:59:06.761 --> 00:59:08.860
<v Speaker 1>and the real issue is she glycemic carbs.</v>

2168
00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:09.760
<v Speaker 1>That's the real issue.</v>

2169
00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:10.840
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to be,</v>

2170
00:59:10.841 --> 00:59:12.700
<v Speaker 1>and I've talked to nutritious about and they're like,</v>

2171
00:59:12.701 --> 00:59:15.970
<v Speaker 1>well some people are more sensitive and some people are the people that are most</v>

2172
00:59:15.971 --> 00:59:16.481
<v Speaker 1>sensitive,</v>

2173
00:59:16.481 --> 00:59:17.270
<v Speaker 1>it's usually</v>

2174
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:19.490
<v Speaker 2>cause they're Pachulia is interacting with,</v>

2175
00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:20.550
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2176
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2177
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.240
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

2178
00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:22.550
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2179
00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:23.060
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

2180
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:23.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2181
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:24.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2182
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.580
<v Speaker 5>Crystal's and gluten,</v>

2183
00:59:25.581 --> 00:59:26.460
<v Speaker 5>haven't they?</v>

2184
00:59:26.461 --> 00:59:27.560
<v Speaker 5>They are the ones where they're,</v>

2185
00:59:27.561 --> 00:59:29.720
<v Speaker 5>the intolerance is within that combination.</v>

2186
00:59:29.721 --> 00:59:30.860
<v Speaker 5>Not the person themselves.</v>

2187
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:31.370
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

2188
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:31.521
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2189
00:59:31.521 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 5>The body's okay with gluten,</v>

2190
00:59:32.781 --> 00:59:34.520
<v Speaker 5>but if you have crystals on it at the same time,</v>

2191
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:35.930
<v Speaker 5>depending on what harmony's,</v>

2192
00:59:35.931 --> 00:59:36.764
<v Speaker 5>they're vibrating at,</v>

2193
00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:39.920
<v Speaker 5>that gluten could be an issue is very important.</v>

2194
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:40.401
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2195
00:59:40.401 --> 00:59:40.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2196
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:42.020
<v Speaker 5>I knew a girl named harmony.</v>

2197
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:43.303
<v Speaker 5>She annoying.</v>

2198
00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:45.020
<v Speaker 5>Oh my goodness.</v>

2199
00:59:45.021 --> 00:59:45.191
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

2200
00:59:45.191 --> 00:59:46.024
<v Speaker 5>color was orange.</v>

2201
00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:47.520
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of a purpleish.</v>

2202
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.890
<v Speaker 5>But that,</v>

2203
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:49.970
<v Speaker 5>that whole thing,</v>

2204
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.410
<v Speaker 5>that gluten thing is like,</v>

2205
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:52.250
<v Speaker 5>there's some to it.</v>

2206
00:59:52.251 --> 00:59:54.590
<v Speaker 5>Like you're not really supposed to be eating bread all the time.</v>

2207
00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:57.230
<v Speaker 5>You're not really supposed to be eaten pasta all the time and your body</v>

2208
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.160
<v Speaker 5>somewhat.</v>

2209
00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.710
<v Speaker 5>Obviously some people have a harder time processing all kinds of different</v>

2210
01:00:00.711 --> 01:00:01.070
<v Speaker 5>foods.</v>

2211
01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:01.821
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's diet.</v>

2212
01:00:01.821 --> 01:00:03.080
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be different to the person,</v>

2213
01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:05.840
<v Speaker 5>but the one thing that will help everybody,</v>

2214
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.130
<v Speaker 5>everybody listening to this,</v>

2215
01:00:07.131 --> 01:00:07.581
<v Speaker 5>if you're here,</v>

2216
01:00:07.581 --> 01:00:10.610
<v Speaker 5>all this gluten frat is cut the fucking sugar out.</v>

2217
01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.830
<v Speaker 5>Just cut it way back.</v>

2218
01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:13.910
<v Speaker 5>Eat Fruit.</v>

2219
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:14.780
<v Speaker 5>If you want some sugar,</v>

2220
01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:15.643
<v Speaker 5>have a peach.</v>

2221
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.720
<v Speaker 5>I have a pair.</v>

2222
01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.260
<v Speaker 5>It'll make a giant difference.</v>

2223
01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:19.320
<v Speaker 5>Totally getting off top.</v>

2224
01:00:19.321 --> 01:00:19.940
<v Speaker 5>We're digressing,</v>

2225
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:20.180
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2226
01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.680
<v Speaker 5>but we're not because we were talking about learning,</v>

2227
01:00:21.681 --> 01:00:22.060
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2228
01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:22.660
<v Speaker 5>Learning true.</v>

2229
01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:26.000
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things even about the whole concept of this gluten stuff,</v>

2230
01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:26.320
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2231
01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.560
<v Speaker 5>And bread and pasta.</v>

2232
01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:29.630
<v Speaker 5>How refined is the shit you're eating too?</v>

2233
01:00:29.631 --> 01:00:33.500
<v Speaker 5>Like if you had bread that was almost as as least refined as possible.</v>

2234
01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's going to be refined to some degree because you made it into fucking</v>

2235
01:00:35.931 --> 01:00:36.710
<v Speaker 5>bread,</v>

2236
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:38.480
<v Speaker 5>but the least refined as possible,</v>

2237
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:42.500
<v Speaker 5>like sprouted grains is way different from cheese ball,</v>

2238
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:43.400
<v Speaker 5>white bread,</v>

2239
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:44.780
<v Speaker 5>wonder bread type shit.</v>

2240
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.450
<v Speaker 5>Salt,</v>

2241
01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:45.880
<v Speaker 5>sugar.</v>

2242
01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2243
01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:47.241
<v Speaker 5>I'm cheese ball,</v>

2244
01:00:47.241 --> 01:00:48.890
<v Speaker 5>white bread and I've been known to be unhealthy.</v>

2245
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:50.360
<v Speaker 5>You're a little cheesy,</v>

2246
01:00:50.361 --> 01:00:51.140
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

2247
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:51.973
<v Speaker 5>it's amusing.</v>

2248
01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:54.680
<v Speaker 5>I love sprouted bread.</v>

2249
01:00:54.681 --> 01:00:55.640
<v Speaker 5>I like like a Zeke,</v>

2250
01:00:55.641 --> 01:00:56.900
<v Speaker 5>you'll bread and stuff like that.</v>

2251
01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

2252
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:59.330
<v Speaker 5>my body doesn't seem to react to that bad at all,</v>

2253
01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.470
<v Speaker 5>but it does tend to burn a little bit on initial uh,</v>

2254
01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:03.621
<v Speaker 5>touch from me.</v>

2255
01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:06.800
<v Speaker 5>But that's because I'm just so unholy and say tonic.</v>

2256
01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:07.910
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem.</v>

2257
01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.130
<v Speaker 5>The [inaudible] no,</v>

2258
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:10.940
<v Speaker 5>it's just like starts glowing hot.</v>

2259
01:01:10.941 --> 01:01:12.200
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know you were unholy.</v>

2260
01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:13.070
<v Speaker 5>Ensay tenant,</v>

2261
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:14.480
<v Speaker 5>all of the above.</v>

2262
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:16.310
<v Speaker 5>How long have you been unholy?</v>

2263
01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:16.920
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2264
01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.560
<v Speaker 5>I think since the day I was born,</v>

2265
01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:21.060
<v Speaker 5>I think when I was born out of that sign or something.</v>

2266
01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:21.290
<v Speaker 5>Or You,</v>

2267
01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:22.910
<v Speaker 5>have you been down since I began to crawl</v>

2268
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:26.480
<v Speaker 5>on the night I was born,</v>

2269
01:01:26.481 --> 01:01:27.980
<v Speaker 5>I heard the moon turn of fire red.</v>

2270
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.983
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

2271
01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:30.711
<v Speaker 5>so you get these,</v>

2272
01:01:30.711 --> 01:01:31.491
<v Speaker 5>these new guys,</v>

2273
01:01:31.491 --> 01:01:36.491
<v Speaker 5>but they're sprouted grain bread and their beats and you get them to a certain</v>

2274
01:01:36.531 --> 01:01:36.801
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>

2275
01:01:36.801 --> 01:01:37.634
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2276
01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:39.140
<v Speaker 5>And then here's the real trouble.</v>

2277
01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.240
<v Speaker 5>They experience some success.</v>

2278
01:01:41.241 --> 01:01:45.560
<v Speaker 5>They get to some point of understanding and of they feel like they know what</v>

2279
01:01:45.561 --> 01:01:47.600
<v Speaker 5>their game is and they know where they can win.</v>

2280
01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:50.750
<v Speaker 5>Getting that motherfucker out of that hole,</v>

2281
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.980
<v Speaker 5>out of that Shell,</v>

2282
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:55.640
<v Speaker 5>that's hard and that's unfortunately where a lot of times you just got to turn</v>

2283
01:01:55.641 --> 01:01:56.150
<v Speaker 5>to a guy and be like,</v>

2284
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.411
<v Speaker 5>hi,</v>

2285
01:01:56.411 --> 01:01:57.244
<v Speaker 5>I'm done with you.</v>

2286
01:01:57.370 --> 01:01:57.950
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

2287
01:01:57.950 --> 01:02:00.560
<v Speaker 5>You have set your own limitation at this point.</v>

2288
01:02:00.561 --> 01:02:00.921
<v Speaker 5>You have,</v>

2289
01:02:00.921 --> 01:02:04.310
<v Speaker 5>you have created your own roadblocks and you don't even understand it.</v>

2290
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:06.530
<v Speaker 5>Sort of like what you were talking about with John Wayne.</v>

2291
01:02:06.531 --> 01:02:10.430
<v Speaker 5>Par like John Wayne Pard not wanting to learn how to rappel because he was so</v>

2292
01:02:10.431 --> 01:02:11.660
<v Speaker 5>good at Moitai eatery,</v>

2293
01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:15.230
<v Speaker 5>cross the Gulf and become an expert and didn't want to become a beginner.</v>

2294
01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:15.741
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2295
01:02:15.741 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 5>John Wayne Card decided he was going to be a failure in terms of grappling</v>

2296
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.550
<v Speaker 2>and MMA.</v>

2297
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:25.550
<v Speaker 2>He decided that it wasn't a matter of whether he could be successful or he are,</v>

2298
01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:26.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2299
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:27.480
<v Speaker 2>he could be mildly successful.</v>

2300
01:02:27.481 --> 01:02:28.560
<v Speaker 2>Greatly successful,</v>

2301
01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:29.693
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

2302
01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:32.430
<v Speaker 2>but he decided that he was going to not be good.</v>

2303
01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:33.230
<v Speaker 3>I had this guy,</v>

2304
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:34.063
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't sure.</v>

2305
01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:35.870
<v Speaker 3>I had this conversation with a God wants about,</v>

2306
01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:36.031
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2307
01:02:36.031 --> 01:02:37.700
<v Speaker 3>this guy who's an MMA fighter.</v>

2308
01:02:37.701 --> 01:02:38.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to name his name,</v>

2309
01:02:38.871 --> 01:02:42.230
<v Speaker 3>but he's a really good kickboxer who gone into MMA and kept getting tapped out.</v>

2310
01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:43.431
<v Speaker 3>And this guy said,</v>

2311
01:02:43.431 --> 01:02:45.260
<v Speaker 3>well he just doesn't have any talent for Jujitsu.</v>

2312
01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.221
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

2313
01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:47.000
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

2314
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:47.181
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2315
01:02:47.181 --> 01:02:49.000
<v Speaker 3>it's not that he doesn't have any talent for Jujitsu.</v>

2316
01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:49.281
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2317
01:02:49.281 --> 01:02:51.680
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you exactly what happens because I know those guys,</v>

2318
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:53.660
<v Speaker 3>they are so good at kickboxing.</v>

2319
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:57.140
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to do Jujitsu cause if they do Jujitsu or submission wrestling</v>

2320
01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:57.980
<v Speaker 3>or whatever the fuck it is,</v>

2321
01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.440
<v Speaker 3>they're going to get tapped out and they don't like getting tapped out.</v>

2322
01:03:00.441 --> 01:03:03.740
<v Speaker 3>So they spend as little time doing that as possible and as much time hitting the</v>

2323
01:03:03.741 --> 01:03:05.000
<v Speaker 3>pads in the bag,</v>

2324
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:06.320
<v Speaker 3>working on their strengths,</v>

2325
01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:07.790
<v Speaker 3>not work on the weaknesses.</v>

2326
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.980
<v Speaker 2>No one likes to feel like they're failing or you know,</v>

2327
01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:11.201
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2328
01:03:11.201 --> 01:03:15.600
<v Speaker 2>it's a hard thing for people to do it to go back to sucking again in some way.</v>

2329
01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:18.020
<v Speaker 2>And I just started training kickboxing,</v>

2330
01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:19.950
<v Speaker 2>karate and La.</v>

2331
01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:25.370
<v Speaker 2>One of my students show he Yamamoto is a junior world champion and uh,</v>

2332
01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:26.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2333
01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:27.800
<v Speaker 2>junior world champion [inaudible],</v>

2334
01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:31.050
<v Speaker 2>he's taken third and fourth and the weight category,</v>

2335
01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.700
<v Speaker 2>a champion world championships.</v>

2336
01:03:32.701 --> 01:03:37.701
<v Speaker 2>He is also the youngest guy to ever compete in the world open weight.</v>

2337
01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.310
<v Speaker 2>He was like 185 pounds or so at the time,</v>

2338
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:43.680
<v Speaker 2>19 years old or so.</v>

2339
01:03:43.681 --> 01:03:48.060
<v Speaker 2>And he made it to top 32 top whatever he fought.</v>

2340
01:03:48.061 --> 01:03:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Like Glau they or someone in law,</v>

2341
01:03:50.041 --> 01:03:50.880
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2342
01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:51.843
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2343
01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:53.003
<v Speaker 2>Fucking kid.</v>

2344
01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:55.050
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2345
01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Cut Out Day has a lot to offer.</v>

2346
01:03:56.431 --> 01:04:00.090
<v Speaker 2>I know all martial arts have something to offer and I've always thought that</v>

2347
01:04:00.091 --> 01:04:00.780
<v Speaker 2>kill chain was a,</v>

2348
01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.820
<v Speaker 2>was a bad ass art and it'd be fun to do.</v>

2349
01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:03.930
<v Speaker 2>And so what I do,</v>

2350
01:04:03.931 --> 01:04:04.441
<v Speaker 2>I show up,</v>

2351
01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:04.891
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

2352
01:04:04.891 --> 01:04:05.760
<v Speaker 2>I got to be a white belt.</v>

2353
01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:07.390
<v Speaker 2>I had to go buy a cut out the [inaudible].</v>

2354
01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.011
<v Speaker 2>I had the,</v>

2355
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.950
<v Speaker 2>I have to sit there and sit in the back of the line with everybody else and be</v>

2356
01:04:10.951 --> 01:04:11.401
<v Speaker 2>nobody.</v>

2357
01:04:11.401 --> 01:04:14.340
<v Speaker 2>And that's okay because people go,</v>

2358
01:04:14.341 --> 01:04:15.174
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

2359
01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:16.380
<v Speaker 2>How come,</v>

2360
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:19.200
<v Speaker 2>how come you're here with a white belt training?</v>

2361
01:04:19.201 --> 01:04:23.700
<v Speaker 2>Conte doing forms and because I like being a white belt,</v>

2362
01:04:23.701 --> 01:04:27.780
<v Speaker 2>I like learning and in a way it's kind of like my yoga because I can throw a</v>

2363
01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:28.351
<v Speaker 2>sidekick,</v>

2364
01:04:28.351 --> 01:04:31.270
<v Speaker 2>but if you make me do sidekick from that with the heels,</v>

2365
01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:31.540
<v Speaker 2>tea,</v>

2366
01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:33.120
<v Speaker 2>it's just a different way of doing it.</v>

2367
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:33.691
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2368
01:04:33.691 --> 01:04:34.381
<v Speaker 2>These forms,</v>

2369
01:04:34.381 --> 01:04:35.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2370
01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:37.950
<v Speaker 2>some of these positions to do these sorts of things,</v>

2371
01:04:37.951 --> 01:04:42.000
<v Speaker 2>so it makes my body stretch and adapt and all I'm doing is getting better,</v>

2372
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:42.751
<v Speaker 2>learning more.</v>

2373
01:04:42.751 --> 01:04:45.660
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that I have to go out there and Sanchia in with my knees and and</v>

2374
01:04:45.661 --> 01:04:48.360
<v Speaker 2>whatever and give somebody a karate chop in the neck.</v>

2375
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:49.200
<v Speaker 2>It's but</v>

2376
01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.560
<v Speaker 3>so learning new movements.</v>

2377
01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:51.040
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2378
01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.240
<v Speaker 3>It's always good to learn new movements.</v>

2379
01:04:52.241 --> 01:04:55.150
<v Speaker 3>You were here once and you were saying that after you left here you were going</v>

2380
01:04:55.151 --> 01:04:56.260
<v Speaker 3>to go train savant.</v>

2381
01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:56.950
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2382
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:57.221
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2383
01:04:57.221 --> 01:04:59.050
<v Speaker 3>I've trained savant for about a couple of years.</v>

2384
01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:01.240
<v Speaker 3>I've never done any savant training.</v>

2385
01:05:01.241 --> 01:05:01.880
<v Speaker 3>What does what do it?</v>

2386
01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.713
<v Speaker 3>Love it.</v>

2387
01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:03.101
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2388
01:05:03.101 --> 01:05:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Here's the simplest way I can,</v>

2389
01:05:04.270 --> 01:05:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I can describe savant,</v>

2390
01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.633
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2391
01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:12.780
<v Speaker 2>think of [inaudible] as like the western boxing equivalent of kickboxing gear</v>

2392
01:05:13.751 --> 01:05:14.980
<v Speaker 2>more Floyd Mayweather.</v>

2393
01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:15.880
<v Speaker 2>Then you are,</v>

2394
01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:17.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2395
01:05:17.201 --> 01:05:17.801
<v Speaker 2>my exam,</v>

2396
01:05:17.801 --> 01:05:18.634
<v Speaker 2>it is</v>

2397
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.960
<v Speaker 5>hitting and getting hit.</v>

2398
01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:21.071
<v Speaker 5>The idea of Nevada,</v>

2399
01:05:21.071 --> 01:05:22.360
<v Speaker 5>it's a touch and not get touched.</v>

2400
01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.930
<v Speaker 5>Lots of footwork using your lead leg lead hand,</v>

2401
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:27.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2402
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:28.300
<v Speaker 5>tons of footwork.</v>

2403
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:30.700
<v Speaker 5>So does not a lot of emphasis on power.</v>

2404
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:31.121
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2405
01:05:31.121 --> 01:05:32.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean you develop power and,</v>

2406
01:05:32.761 --> 01:05:33.200
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2407
01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.110
<v Speaker 5>and you have your kill shot opportunities.</v>

2408
01:05:35.111 --> 01:05:38.110
<v Speaker 5>But really it's about being scoring off,</v>

2409
01:05:38.111 --> 01:05:42.580
<v Speaker 5>balancing angling w there's a great fight Raymond deckers versus Pinocchio.</v>

2410
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:45.840
<v Speaker 5>This Italian Slovak guy and it's fine.</v>

2411
01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:46.170
<v Speaker 5>Fine.</v>

2412
01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:46.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2413
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:50.280
<v Speaker 5>If I will check with Jamie and Christ Pinocchio Beats with vectors.</v>

2414
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.300
<v Speaker 5>Get the fuck you're watching it.</v>

2415
01:05:52.301 --> 01:05:52.631
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

2416
01:05:52.631 --> 01:05:52.931
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

2417
01:05:52.931 --> 01:05:53.410
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

2418
01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:56.740
<v Speaker 5>This dude beat Ramon Dekkers off savant guy beat Ramon Dekkers.</v>

2419
01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:57.420
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

2420
01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:57.670
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2421
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:58.200
<v Speaker 5>five rounds.</v>

2422
01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.033
<v Speaker 5>Decker like five.</v>

2423
01:05:59.480 --> 01:05:59.921
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2424
01:05:59.921 --> 01:06:00.341
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>

2425
01:06:00.341 --> 01:06:01.174
<v Speaker 5>he was a kid.</v>

2426
01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:01.721
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2427
01:06:01.721 --> 01:06:03.250
<v Speaker 5>he was at least seven and a half.</v>

2428
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:08.470
<v Speaker 5>I think John Wayne Parr had just beat him up really bad and practice and his</v>

2429
01:06:08.471 --> 01:06:09.400
<v Speaker 5>confidence was shot.</v>

2430
01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.240
<v Speaker 5>So a Pinocchio beats deckers.</v>

2431
01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:15.430
<v Speaker 5>But how he does it is by scoring more,</v>

2432
01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:16.480
<v Speaker 5>but being elusive.</v>

2433
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:20.650
<v Speaker 5>And you watch the two fighters and you can see it absolutely different.</v>

2434
01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:22.450
<v Speaker 5>This Nokia is a real boy.</v>

2435
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:23.061
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2436
01:06:23.061 --> 01:06:23.380
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2437
01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.910
<v Speaker 5>it's Panofsky oh bro.</v>

2438
01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:30.640
<v Speaker 5>You Watch deckers and deckers is full of power,</v>

2439
01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:31.690
<v Speaker 5>tons of power.</v>

2440
01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:33.010
<v Speaker 5>And when he kicks,</v>

2441
01:06:33.011 --> 01:06:35.560
<v Speaker 5>you can see this just bone shattering type stuff.</v>

2442
01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:36.880
<v Speaker 5>What year was this?</v>

2443
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.890
<v Speaker 5>Early nineties.</v>

2444
01:06:38.891 --> 01:06:41.140
<v Speaker 5>Or Ramon was still under the prime.</v>

2445
01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:41.441
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2446
01:06:41.441 --> 01:06:41.740
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

2447
01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.110
<v Speaker 5>Ramon was still knocking out ties over in Thailand.</v>

2448
01:06:44.111 --> 01:06:47.140
<v Speaker 5>But the thing is Pinocchio was almost never there to get hit.</v>

2449
01:06:47.141 --> 01:06:49.030
<v Speaker 5>And the other thing is when he's taking these shots,</v>

2450
01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.650
<v Speaker 5>he slides and moves with them.</v>

2451
01:06:50.651 --> 01:06:54.340
<v Speaker 5>He always takes the power out of it and there's quite a few times he kicks</v>

2452
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.950
<v Speaker 5>deckers legs out from underneath them while he's trying to,</v>

2453
01:06:57.370 --> 01:06:58.920
<v Speaker 5>he's trying to wind up on them really,</v>

2454
01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:02.320
<v Speaker 5>and tags him with a lot of shots with up top with the hands.</v>

2455
01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.720
<v Speaker 5>This is very interesting.</v>

2456
01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:05.411
<v Speaker 5>And it's not,</v>

2457
01:07:05.411 --> 01:07:08.740
<v Speaker 5>the deckers is worst fighter than Pinocchio.</v>

2458
01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:10.540
<v Speaker 5>Don't turn it into that kind of thing.</v>

2459
01:07:10.570 --> 01:07:10.720
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2460
01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.260
<v Speaker 5>listeners,</v>

2461
01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.300
<v Speaker 5>it's about style right here.</v>

2462
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.440
<v Speaker 5>This is what it came down to.</v>

2463
01:07:14.441 --> 01:07:16.930
<v Speaker 5>It was a guy using a different tactic against,</v>

2464
01:07:16.931 --> 01:07:17.470
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2465
01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:17.681
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2466
01:07:17.681 --> 01:07:22.681
<v Speaker 5>he's not gonna match power with this dude who could Raymond and was just a</v>

2467
01:07:23.111 --> 01:07:23.944
<v Speaker 5>destroyer.</v>

2468
01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:27.130
<v Speaker 5>Too much power kicked in the Dick Right there.</v>

2469
01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.230
<v Speaker 5>Now they're wearing those shoes.</v>

2470
01:07:29.231 --> 01:07:30.200
<v Speaker 5>Why are they wearing the,</v>

2471
01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:35.440
<v Speaker 5>some sort of fucking your whatever European leagues thing about,</v>

2472
01:07:35.441 --> 01:07:36.101
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

2473
01:07:36.101 --> 01:07:38.170
<v Speaker 5>This is back in the day when kickboxing was different,</v>

2474
01:07:38.171 --> 01:07:39.060
<v Speaker 5>everywhere you went in.</v>

2475
01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:40.180
<v Speaker 5>This is kickboxing.</v>

2476
01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:40.911
<v Speaker 5>There's no clinch.</v>

2477
01:07:40.911 --> 01:07:41.744
<v Speaker 5>There's no clinch,</v>

2478
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:42.221
<v Speaker 5>no claims,</v>

2479
01:07:42.221 --> 01:07:42.671
<v Speaker 5>no elbows,</v>

2480
01:07:42.671 --> 01:07:43.504
<v Speaker 5>no knees.</v>

2481
01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.740
<v Speaker 5>What do you think about that?</v>

2482
01:07:44.741 --> 01:07:47.050
<v Speaker 5>Like the glory rules as opposed to full moy?</v>

2483
01:07:47.051 --> 01:07:48.640
<v Speaker 5>Moitai uh,</v>

2484
01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:52.750
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] has a tendency to get boring as shit when they get in the clinch and</v>

2485
01:07:52.751 --> 01:07:55.780
<v Speaker 5>there there's throwing side on the after side knee and no one's really landing</v>

2486
01:07:55.781 --> 01:07:56.321
<v Speaker 5>anything of,</v>

2487
01:07:56.321 --> 01:08:00.610
<v Speaker 5>and they're hanging on each other and I understand why they want,</v>

2488
01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:01.923
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2489
01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:02.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2490
01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:04.900
<v Speaker 5>people to be at that mid range or long range,</v>

2491
01:08:04.901 --> 01:08:06.100
<v Speaker 5>just tagging each other,</v>

2492
01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:07.031
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2493
01:08:07.031 --> 01:08:08.560
<v Speaker 5>because it looks more exciting to the,</v>

2494
01:08:08.561 --> 01:08:09.610
<v Speaker 5>to the casual fans.</v>

2495
01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:12.280
<v Speaker 5>I kind of get it from that perspective,</v>

2496
01:08:12.281 --> 01:08:14.250
<v Speaker 5>but I don't like it as far as uh,</v>

2497
01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.193
<v Speaker 5>a style.</v>

2498
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:19.670
<v Speaker 5>You see that lead leg hook kick and then invaded his low return,</v>

2499
01:08:19.671 --> 01:08:20.870
<v Speaker 5>low kick at the same time.</v>

2500
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:21.733
<v Speaker 5>It was barely a,</v>

2501
01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.360
<v Speaker 5>it was more like a ax kick.</v>

2502
01:08:23.361 --> 01:08:24.260
<v Speaker 5>It looked like a slap.</v>

2503
01:08:24.261 --> 01:08:27.380
<v Speaker 5>I don't foot slap inside low high again,</v>

2504
01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.360
<v Speaker 5>and he's just moving a lot constantly.</v>

2505
01:08:29.361 --> 01:08:29.750
<v Speaker 5>And look,</v>

2506
01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:32.750
<v Speaker 5>it's just spinning off of his kick and sliding away as he's kicking.</v>

2507
01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:33.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2508
01:08:33.290 --> 01:08:34.620
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio also beat,</v>

2509
01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:35.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2522
01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:54.380
<v Speaker 5>one of the things I like to do use if at all possible on teach to people is</v>

2523
01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:55.100
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2524
01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:55.431
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2525
01:08:55.431 --> 01:08:55.551
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

2526
01:08:55.551 --> 01:08:56.930
<v Speaker 5>how much do you think your leg ways,</v>

2527
01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.280
<v Speaker 5>oh my 30,</v>

2528
01:08:58.281 --> 01:08:59.000
<v Speaker 5>40 pounds,</v>

2529
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.790
<v Speaker 5>if you just got it up there as fast and as quick and as con.</v>

2530
01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:05.300
<v Speaker 5>And it's to the point as possible if you score as clean as possible and as</v>

2531
01:09:05.301 --> 01:09:06.134
<v Speaker 5>quick,</v>

2532
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.210
<v Speaker 5>I don't need to throw hard,</v>

2533
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:12.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean forces is a mass times velocity squared,</v>

2534
01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:17.570
<v Speaker 5>so let's work on the velocity squared and not trying to generate more,</v>

2535
01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:18.860
<v Speaker 5>more uh,</v>

2536
01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:20.113
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2537
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:21.920
<v Speaker 5>strength into that movement.</v>

2538
01:09:21.921 --> 01:09:22.754
<v Speaker 5>But just speed,</v>

2539
01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:23.091
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2540
01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:25.190
<v Speaker 5>So mean or killed kitchen style,</v>

2541
01:09:25.191 --> 01:09:26.270
<v Speaker 5>then Muy Thai style.</v>

2542
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:27.030
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2543
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:28.290
<v Speaker 5>Kilcoyne has a tendency to kick,</v>

2544
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:32.210
<v Speaker 5>try to really kick the baseball bat to part two at times.</v>

2545
01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:33.470
<v Speaker 5>But with savant,</v>

2546
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you can even watch some of the old American kickboxing stuff back in</v>

2547
01:09:36.861 --> 01:09:40.130
<v Speaker 5>the day and those guys were so adept at going from foot to hand to hand to foot</v>

2548
01:09:40.131 --> 01:09:40.964
<v Speaker 5>and foot the hand,</v>

2549
01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.310
<v Speaker 5>obviously it was tailored to the game.</v>

2550
01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.480
<v Speaker 5>But if you thought,</v>

2551
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:45.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2552
01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:47.030
<v Speaker 5>just watch a Guy Metzger,</v>

2553
01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:47.893
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2554
01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:48.170
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2555
01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:50.600
<v Speaker 5>what's his Arona they're out there in this bit,</v>

2556
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:52.760
<v Speaker 5>just a nice little kick lead leg,</v>

2557
01:09:52.761 --> 01:09:56.300
<v Speaker 5>high kick and this whack and all of a sudden a Rhone is on roller skates and it</v>

2558
01:09:56.301 --> 01:09:57.410
<v Speaker 5>didn't even look like much.</v>

2559
01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:57.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2560
01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:02.660
<v Speaker 5>You seeing that sometimes today we are seeing more of a karate style.</v>

2561
01:10:02.661 --> 01:10:05.770
<v Speaker 5>Like Machida is a perfect example is no windup.</v>

2562
01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:07.940
<v Speaker 5>There's no step before he throws the back round kick.</v>

2563
01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:10.080
<v Speaker 5>Well he just throws it right from their pedis.</v>

2564
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:11.000
<v Speaker 5>Does that as well?</v>

2565
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2566
01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.510
<v Speaker 5>You've seen a lot of guys that are front kicks taking people out as if that was</v>

2567
01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:15.800
<v Speaker 5>never a legit technique.</v>

2568
01:10:15.801 --> 01:10:16.311
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2569
01:10:16.311 --> 01:10:18.060
<v Speaker 5>And there's a bazillion ways to throw front kick.</v>

2570
01:10:18.061 --> 01:10:18.891
<v Speaker 5>You can throw a tie us to,</v>

2571
01:10:18.891 --> 01:10:19.700
<v Speaker 5>I'll push kick.</v>

2572
01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:21.770
<v Speaker 5>You could throw the taekwondo one where you like.</v>

2573
01:10:21.771 --> 01:10:26.771
<v Speaker 5>Victor Webster has one of the nastiest push kicks ever and he'll fuck and he's</v>

2574
01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:28.790
<v Speaker 5>out here and he steps in,</v>

2575
01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:32.180
<v Speaker 5>he rides into it and then he hits you right in the hip and makes you sit on the</v>

2576
01:10:32.181 --> 01:10:33.014
<v Speaker 5>floor.</v>

2577
01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:33.711

2580
01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:38.910
<v Speaker 5>He just stomps right through your hip and then you've got cut out.</v>

2581
01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:39.441
<v Speaker 5>They style,</v>

2582
01:10:39.441 --> 01:10:43.490
<v Speaker 5>we pick it up and fold it and then punt as Jim Harrison would say with the ball</v>

2583
01:10:43.491 --> 01:10:45.710
<v Speaker 5>of the foot and you get them right in the chin,</v>

2584
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:46.910
<v Speaker 5>the solar plexus,</v>

2585
01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:47.960
<v Speaker 5>diaphragm area.</v>

2586
01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.390
<v Speaker 5>You could turn it over like Savannah likes to do and,</v>

2587
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:52.070
<v Speaker 5>or even Kilcoyne has it too.</v>

2588
01:10:52.071 --> 01:10:52.904
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>

2589
01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:54.640
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2590
01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:55.401
<v Speaker 5>Kiko knows,</v>

2591
01:10:55.401 --> 01:11:00.290
<v Speaker 5>kick the McCaw Zwicky Gary and punt it right into the liver and it's,</v>

2592
01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:00.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2593
01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:01.281
<v Speaker 5>ball of the foot.</v>

2594
01:11:01.281 --> 01:11:02.780
<v Speaker 5>How much surface area is that?</v>

2595
01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:03.620
<v Speaker 5>It's just a,</v>

2596
01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:04.520
<v Speaker 5>the end of the Hammer,</v>

2597
01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.260
<v Speaker 5>the head of the hammer hitting right into the point.</v>

2598
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:09.950
<v Speaker 5>And then there's a lot of old school taekwondo guys that would throw round kicks</v>

2599
01:11:09.951 --> 01:11:10.131
<v Speaker 5>butt.</v>

2600
01:11:10.131 --> 01:11:13.070
<v Speaker 5>They would throw it and land the ball of the foot like a front kick.</v>

2601
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:13.740
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

2602
01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 5>That was</v>

2603
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:15.500
<v Speaker 2>a big thing that used to do back in the day.</v>

2604
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Kicked it where at the air,</v>

2605
01:11:16.901 --> 01:11:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Paulson ways Ho holds this camp.</v>

2606
01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2607
01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.660
<v Speaker 2>every year it's a big full on,</v>

2608
01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.180
<v Speaker 2>there'll be multiple instructors teaching all this stuff and all these people</v>

2609
01:11:24.181 --> 01:11:27.900
<v Speaker 2>come from all over his affiliate gyms and they pile into our gym during our</v>

2610
01:11:27.901 --> 01:11:28.531
<v Speaker 2>training time.</v>

2611
01:11:28.531 --> 01:11:30.480
<v Speaker 2>So he just integrates everyone together.</v>

2612
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:32.370
<v Speaker 2>And I always just tell Paul and I go,</v>

2613
01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:35.610
<v Speaker 2>don't stick the Newbie fucking goof balls in there with me.</v>

2614
01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:38.010
<v Speaker 2>If I've got a fight coming up and these user in here,</v>

2615
01:11:38.011 --> 01:11:39.270
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get wrecked like that.</v>

2616
01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:39.540
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2617
01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:42.510
<v Speaker 2>this is not my job to help this dude have a good time at camp.</v>

2618
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:43.381
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting ready.</v>

2619
01:11:43.381 --> 01:11:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Please just don't do it,</v>

2620
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:44.760
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2621
01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:45.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2622
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:45.421
<v Speaker 2>you could just,</v>

2623
01:11:45.421 --> 01:11:46.111
<v Speaker 2>you could just take it easy.</v>

2624
01:11:46.111 --> 01:11:46.321
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2625
01:11:46.321 --> 01:11:46.681
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2626
01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:50.640
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to go easy on me for one because I'm me and they want to</v>

2627
01:11:50.641 --> 01:11:51.690
<v Speaker 2>either they're excited,</v>

2628
01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:52.560
<v Speaker 2>scared,</v>

2629
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.760
<v Speaker 2>or want to prove something,</v>

2630
01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:55.140
<v Speaker 2>so I don't want it.</v>

2631
01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to deal with it.</v>

2632
01:11:56.610 --> 01:11:57.630
<v Speaker 2>But if I have to,</v>

2633
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:58.703
<v Speaker 2>I'm burying them.</v>

2634
01:11:58.770 --> 01:12:00.750
<v Speaker 2>So that's just the way it is.</v>

2635
01:12:00.751 --> 01:12:01.141
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

2636
01:12:01.141 --> 01:12:01.501
<v Speaker 2>we're in there.</v>

2637
01:12:01.501 --> 01:12:04.050
<v Speaker 2>We're kickboxing that this kid and fucking,</v>

2638
01:12:04.051 --> 01:12:04.741
<v Speaker 2>he turns it up.</v>

2639
01:12:04.741 --> 01:12:04.951
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2640
01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:05.784
<v Speaker 2>God damn it.</v>

2641
01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.900
<v Speaker 2>So what do I do?</v>

2642
01:12:06.901 --> 01:12:07.711
<v Speaker 2>I step up,</v>

2643
01:12:07.711 --> 01:12:08.760
<v Speaker 2>throw a left high,</v>

2644
01:12:08.761 --> 01:12:09.750
<v Speaker 2>kick off the lead leg,</v>

2645
01:12:09.751 --> 01:12:11.430
<v Speaker 2>but I turn it over to hit with the ball of the foot.</v>

2646
01:12:11.431 --> 01:12:13.650
<v Speaker 2>I just stabbed him right in the jaw with it.</v>

2647
01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:14.953
<v Speaker 2>He stuns,</v>

2648
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:18.300
<v Speaker 2>puts his hand up quits for the whole day.</v>

2649
01:12:18.301 --> 01:12:19.134
<v Speaker 2>He's done.</v>

2650
01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:19.960
<v Speaker 2>He says that,</v>

2651
01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2652
01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:21.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

2653
01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:22.043
<v Speaker 2>Forget it.</v>

2654
01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:23.940
<v Speaker 2>It was probably a good idea.</v>

2655
01:12:23.941 --> 01:12:24.390
<v Speaker 2>It was lovely.</v>

2656
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:25.171
<v Speaker 2>It was a good idea.</v>

2657
01:12:25.171 --> 01:12:27.810
<v Speaker 2>I got a concussion for all I know.</v>

2658
01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:29.123
<v Speaker 2>Whenever we learn,</v>

2659
01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:31.410
<v Speaker 2>that's my problem with tournaments.</v>

2660
01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.710
<v Speaker 2>Like especially those are kickboxing tournament,</v>

2661
01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:34.171
<v Speaker 2>they're doing,</v>

2662
01:12:34.171 --> 01:12:34.771
<v Speaker 2>large guys are,</v>

2663
01:12:34.771 --> 01:12:37.080
<v Speaker 2>they're getting essentially knocked out in their first fight.</v>

2664
01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:37.913
<v Speaker 2>They recover,</v>

2665
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2666
01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:38.950
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2667
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:39.360
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2668
01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:42.120
<v Speaker 2>they get dropped or stunned or fucked up and then they have like,</v>

2669
01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:42.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2670
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:42.841
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

2671
01:12:42.841 --> 01:12:46.500
<v Speaker 2>30 minutes for everything to cool down and really hurt and then they get back in</v>

2672
01:12:46.501 --> 01:12:47.340
<v Speaker 2>there and do it again.</v>

2673
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:48.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2674
01:12:48.271 --> 01:12:48.870
<v Speaker 2>I hear Ya.</v>

2675
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:49.261
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2676
01:12:49.261 --> 01:12:52.320
<v Speaker 2>I was just having this conversation with somebody the other day about,</v>

2677
01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:53.363
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2678
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:54.660
<v Speaker 2>I was with a referee actually,</v>

2679
01:12:54.661 --> 01:12:55.021
<v Speaker 2>and I go,</v>

2680
01:12:55.021 --> 01:12:55.854
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2681
01:12:56.010 --> 01:12:57.600
<v Speaker 2>we need tournaments back in MMA.</v>

2682
01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:58.740
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2683
01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:59.131
<v Speaker 2>and they go,</v>

2684
01:12:59.131 --> 01:12:59.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2685
01:12:59.790 --> 01:12:59.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2686
01:12:59.930 --> 01:13:00.661
<v Speaker 2>we can run a tournament.</v>

2687
01:13:00.661 --> 01:13:01.050
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

2688
01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:01.883
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2689
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.900
<v Speaker 2>I know the fucking stupid ruling where they say,</v>

2690
01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:04.111
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2691
01:13:04.111 --> 01:13:05.250
<v Speaker 2>as long as you don't exceed a five,</v>

2692
01:13:05.251 --> 01:13:06.630
<v Speaker 2>five minute rounds in a night.</v>

2693
01:13:06.631 --> 01:13:07.110
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

2694
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.920
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't,</v>

2695
01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.420
<v Speaker 2>if I'm fighting pro boxing,</v>

2696
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm out there for 36 minutes.</v>

2697
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:15.240
<v Speaker 2>You're telling me that an MMA fighter can't go 36 minutes.</v>

2698
01:13:15.241 --> 01:13:15.721
<v Speaker 2>If it was,</v>

2699
01:13:15.721 --> 01:13:17.250
<v Speaker 2>if you gave me 36 minutes,</v>

2700
01:13:17.251 --> 01:13:20.400
<v Speaker 2>then you could go to fives and three fives and a final.</v>

2701
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.170
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

2702
01:13:22.171 --> 01:13:22.471
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2703
01:13:22.471 --> 01:13:24.420
<v Speaker 2>there's guys who can barely get through one five now.</v>

2704
01:13:24.421 --> 01:13:24.660
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2705
01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck good.</v>

2706
01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully they get the shit kicked out of them and they fucking figure it out.</v>

2707
01:13:28.891 --> 01:13:29.371
<v Speaker 2>Either a,</v>

2708
01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:32.010
<v Speaker 2>how to be able to go past the five or B.</v>

2709
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.330
<v Speaker 2>This ain't the sport for you.</v>

2710
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:34.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2711
01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:35.340
<v Speaker 2>we're not supposed to make it.</v>

2712
01:13:35.341 --> 01:13:36.630
<v Speaker 2>So when you're a professional,</v>

2713
01:13:36.631 --> 01:13:38.430
<v Speaker 2>everybody doesn't need to be able to compete.</v>

2714
01:13:38.431 --> 01:13:39.360
<v Speaker 2>When you're an amateur.</v>

2715
01:13:39.450 --> 01:13:40.920
<v Speaker 2>I have some understanding.</v>

2716
01:13:40.921 --> 01:13:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Everyone should be able to get in the ring with,</v>

2717
01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.820
<v Speaker 2>with a modest amount of training,</v>

2718
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:45.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2719
01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.620
<v Speaker 2>to go out there and do it,</v>

2720
01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:47.790
<v Speaker 2>but not pros.</v>

2721
01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that they should bring back tournaments?</v>

2722
01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:54.120
<v Speaker 2>Every combat sport in the world has tournament day,</v>

2723
01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.073
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2724
01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:56.820
<v Speaker 2>And we love it.</v>

2725
01:13:57.090 --> 01:13:58.680
<v Speaker 2>We love the shit out of tournaments.</v>

2726
01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Japan loves everything.</v>

2727
01:14:00.181 --> 01:14:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Fighting and going to tournaments so much they fucking make,</v>

2728
01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:05.130
<v Speaker 2>they'll have a TV show and it's battle.</v>

2729
01:14:05.131 --> 01:14:07.500
<v Speaker 2>And there was a piece of celery versus a Yam like which is,</v>

2730
01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:10.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how you compare those tube or why,</v>

2731
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:11.260
<v Speaker 2>how you make them fight.</v>

2732
01:14:11.261 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even give him a little</v>

2733
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.720
<v Speaker 1>knives or anything,</v>

2734
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:18.280
<v Speaker 1>but for a shield and tried and salary fighters don't want to do tournaments</v>

2735
01:14:18.281 --> 01:14:18.941
<v Speaker 1>because they feel like,</v>

2736
01:14:18.941 --> 01:14:21.460
<v Speaker 1>like say if there's a four man tournament,</v>

2737
01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:26.490
<v Speaker 1>you have a fight in the first round and you win in 10 seconds by knockout and</v>

2738
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:30.340
<v Speaker 1>then they go to rounds and there's a draw.</v>

2739
01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:32.620
<v Speaker 1>So they go to a third round and it's brutal.</v>

2740
01:14:32.621 --> 01:14:36.610
<v Speaker 1>They're all bang the fuck up and then they have to fight you in the finals and</v>

2741
01:14:36.611 --> 01:14:40.060
<v Speaker 1>you went through 10 seconds of fighting and they've been good.</v>

2742
01:14:40.061 --> 01:14:42.790
<v Speaker 1>They've got the fuck beat out of them and they're all banged up.</v>

2743
01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.380
<v Speaker 1>It should have been a better fighter I guess.</v>

2744
01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Is that really what it is?</v>

2745
01:14:45.371 --> 01:14:49.090
<v Speaker 1>What if the draw is what have you got fade or and a your opponent,</v>

2746
01:14:49.091 --> 01:14:53.500
<v Speaker 1>God willing to wimp willy the wimp in his Cadillac coffin and willy,</v>

2747
01:14:53.501 --> 01:14:54.070
<v Speaker 1>the Wimp guy.</v>

2748
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:57.460
<v Speaker 1>K owed and the first round and then you went,</v>

2749
01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.590
<v Speaker 1>or what if it's raining hard rounds</v>

2750
01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:04.070
<v Speaker 5>and then the other guy gets Vandelay and he's cro cop.</v>

2751
01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:04.671
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2752
01:15:04.671 --> 01:15:05.510
<v Speaker 5>well you did do that,</v>

2753
01:15:05.511 --> 01:15:06.920
<v Speaker 5>but fuck it.</v>

2754
01:15:06.921 --> 01:15:07.521
<v Speaker 5>You know what I did?</v>

2755
01:15:07.521 --> 01:15:08.211
<v Speaker 5>I laid in the back,</v>

2756
01:15:08.211 --> 01:15:08.991
<v Speaker 5>I had ivs,</v>

2757
01:15:08.991 --> 01:15:09.890
<v Speaker 5>I had ice on me.</v>

2758
01:15:10.190 --> 01:15:12.830
<v Speaker 5>And honestly the biggest problem wasn't even the fighting,</v>

2759
01:15:12.831 --> 01:15:15.590
<v Speaker 5>it was getting heat exhaustion before you even showed up for the tournament</v>

2760
01:15:15.591 --> 01:15:20.540
<v Speaker 5>because dead summer of Orange County and we had no air conditioning whatsoever.</v>

2761
01:15:20.541 --> 01:15:22.100
<v Speaker 5>No breezeways and that old gym.</v>

2762
01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:25.010
<v Speaker 5>And I started off doing 10 minute rounds,</v>

2763
01:15:25.011 --> 01:15:27.530
<v Speaker 5>just going through name profilers,</v>

2764
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:28.423
<v Speaker 5>owning them,</v>

2765
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:30.050
<v Speaker 5>and then all of a sudden eight minutes,</v>

2766
01:15:30.170 --> 01:15:31.130
<v Speaker 5>then six minutes,</v>

2767
01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.160
<v Speaker 5>then for then I can barely get a two minute round off without falling apart.</v>

2768
01:15:34.161 --> 01:15:34.590
<v Speaker 5>And I'm just going,</v>

2769
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:35.750
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>

2770
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:41.450
<v Speaker 5>And then people start packing me with ice bags in between rounds and in between</v>

2771
01:15:41.451 --> 01:15:41.901
<v Speaker 5>sessions.</v>

2772
01:15:41.901 --> 01:15:43.880
<v Speaker 5>And all of a sudden my energy would start to come back.</v>

2773
01:15:43.881 --> 01:15:45.020
<v Speaker 5>Some I just go,</v>

2774
01:15:45.021 --> 01:15:46.060
<v Speaker 5>oh well this is fucked.</v>

2775
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2776
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Let's get over there and do it.</v>

2777
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:50.810
<v Speaker 1>So you were training and as you were training,</v>

2778
01:15:50.811 --> 01:15:53.540
<v Speaker 1>you had no air conditioning in the gym and you're getting a heat exhaustion.</v>

2779
01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:56.110
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking a hundred degrees outside at times.</v>

2780
01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Fucked with your conditioning when you actually went to fight because you never</v>

2781
01:15:58.581 --> 01:16:01.340
<v Speaker 1>were able to push by the time tosh.</v>

2782
01:16:01.650 --> 01:16:04.230
<v Speaker 5>But I mean there were things like when Nogueira mounted me,</v>

2783
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.890
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

2784
01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:08.670
<v Speaker 5>I gave him my arm on purpose because I couldn't get them off of mount because I</v>

2785
01:16:08.671 --> 01:16:09.331
<v Speaker 5>couldn't expand.</v>

2786
01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:11.250
<v Speaker 5>That kind of energy just wasn't there.</v>

2787
01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:12.150
<v Speaker 5>So if he,</v>

2788
01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:14.040
<v Speaker 5>I know if he goes to try and arm bar me,</v>

2789
01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:14.874
<v Speaker 5>that shit ain't going to happen.</v>

2790
01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:16.320
<v Speaker 1>So this is just because of the,</v>

2791
01:16:16.321 --> 01:16:19.960
<v Speaker 1>all the time that you spent in the gym under heat exhaustion.</v>

2792
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2793
01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:20.970
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

2794
01:16:20.970 --> 01:16:23.440
<v Speaker 1>you were never able to do those 10 minute rounds,</v>

2795
01:16:23.441 --> 01:16:25.110
<v Speaker 1>those long rounds in the gym because just,</v>

2796
01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:25.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2797
01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:26.410
<v Speaker 1>it just got too hot.</v>

2798
01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you guys would fucking air conditioning and your gym?</v>

2799
01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:29.741
<v Speaker 1>Not My gym,</v>

2800
01:16:29.741 --> 01:16:30.700
<v Speaker 1>not my decision.</v>

2801
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Now Eric Paulson has Jim.</v>

2802
01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:33.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2803
01:16:33.011 --> 01:16:33.844
<v Speaker 1>Was it cesium?</v>

2804
01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:34.810
<v Speaker 1>But fuck,</v>

2805
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:36.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2806
01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:36.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2807
01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

2808
01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:37.580
<v Speaker 1>I struggled</v>

2809
01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:37.770
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

2810
01:16:37.770 --> 01:16:38.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2811
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.903
<v Speaker 5>to get back,</v>

2812
01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.753
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2813
01:16:40.050 --> 01:16:44.190
<v Speaker 5>until it took me about until next year before I really finally fucking felt</v>

2814
01:16:44.191 --> 01:16:44.821
<v Speaker 5>better again.</v>

2815
01:16:44.821 --> 01:16:45.780
<v Speaker 5>When I find master law,</v>

2816
01:16:45.781 --> 01:16:47.810
<v Speaker 5>I was still just struggle.</v>

2817
01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:48.221
<v Speaker 5>My,</v>

2818
01:16:48.221 --> 01:16:51.300
<v Speaker 5>my CNS was shot central nervous system.</v>

2819
01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:51.821
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2820
01:16:51.821 --> 01:16:53.040
<v Speaker 1>My adrenals is from,</v>

2821
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:54.610
<v Speaker 1>from the helix you off so bad.</v>

2822
01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:55.481
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2823
01:16:55.481 --> 01:16:56.830
<v Speaker 1>What about Kronk Gym?</v>

2824
01:16:56.831 --> 01:16:57.790
<v Speaker 1>The fucking Detroit,</v>

2825
01:16:57.791 --> 01:17:00.670
<v Speaker 1>they would crank up the heat and I hate that shit</v>

2826
01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:04.260
<v Speaker 5>is I'm more susceptible to it,</v>

2827
01:17:04.261 --> 01:17:08.900
<v Speaker 5>I think than others because I'm so white viking like that.</v>

2828
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:09.620
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>

2829
01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:09.861
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2830
01:17:09.861 --> 01:17:11.930
<v Speaker 5>a little bit of cold would probably would have done me some good.</v>

2831
01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:12.141
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2832
01:17:12.141 --> 01:17:12.610
<v Speaker 5>If you were,</v>

2833
01:17:12.610 --> 01:17:12.850
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2834
01:17:12.850 --> 01:17:14.970
<v Speaker 5>Some African dude in there sparring with you,</v>

2835
01:17:15.210 --> 01:17:16.190
<v Speaker 5>you'd have an advantage.</v>

2836
01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:16.701
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2837
01:17:16.701 --> 01:17:16.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2838
01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:21.080
<v Speaker 5>some people don't take the heat as well as others and some people do.</v>

2839
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.441
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2840
01:17:21.441 --> 01:17:22.580
<v Speaker 5>it's just a matter of fact.</v>

2841
01:17:22.581 --> 01:17:23.040
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2842
01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:23.873
<v Speaker 5>and here's the thing,</v>

2843
01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:25.190
<v Speaker 5>I got over there.</v>

2844
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:26.630
<v Speaker 5>I fought my ass off.</v>

2845
01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:27.980
<v Speaker 5>I was exhausted.</v>

2846
01:17:27.981 --> 01:17:29.510
<v Speaker 5>I could have been bowed out and be like,</v>

2847
01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:30.580
<v Speaker 5>oh no cro cop,</v>

2848
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.731
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

2849
01:17:30.731 --> 01:17:31.151
<v Speaker 5>he's gonna,</v>

2850
01:17:31.151 --> 01:17:33.650
<v Speaker 5>he's just going to walk over into the finals and everybody who was going to be</v>

2851
01:17:33.651 --> 01:17:33.770
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2852
01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:34.340
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2853
01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:35.930
<v Speaker 5>he had a really tough fight with Nogueira.</v>

2854
01:17:35.931 --> 01:17:36.770
<v Speaker 5>That's acceptable.</v>

2855
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:38.540
<v Speaker 5>We'll give him a pass on that,</v>

2856
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:39.860
<v Speaker 5>but I wouldn't give me a pass.</v>

2857
01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:40.753
<v Speaker 5>Fuck that.</v>

2858
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:41.750
<v Speaker 5>So what did I do?</v>

2859
01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.700
<v Speaker 5>They put ice bags on anything.</v>

2860
01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:44.534
<v Speaker 5>It was banged up.</v>

2861
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:45.770
<v Speaker 5>Doctors came back,</v>

2862
01:17:45.771 --> 01:17:50.771
<v Speaker 5>gave me an ivy and some vitamins and a hung it off of the locker door and I just</v>

2863
01:17:50.781 --> 01:17:54.500
<v Speaker 5>laid on the ground and I had been gloomy Fuji with me and my ex girlfriend at</v>

2864
01:17:54.501 --> 01:17:59.501
<v Speaker 5>the time and Eric and [inaudible] and my friends with me and I just was there</v>

2865
01:17:59.871 --> 01:18:00.321
<v Speaker 5>with them.</v>

2866
01:18:00.321 --> 01:18:02.690
<v Speaker 5>And the refs come,</v>

2867
01:18:02.691 --> 01:18:03.890
<v Speaker 5>the officials come back and go,</v>

2868
01:18:03.891 --> 01:18:05.270
<v Speaker 5>so are you going to fight the last fight?</v>

2869
01:18:05.271 --> 01:18:05.451
<v Speaker 5>And like,</v>

2870
01:18:05.451 --> 01:18:05.661
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

2871
01:18:05.661 --> 01:18:08.030
<v Speaker 5>I am damn right I am,</v>

2872
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:10.610
<v Speaker 5>because that's what a man does.</v>

2873
01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:12.133
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2874
01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:13.101
<v Speaker 5>I fought,</v>

2875
01:18:13.101 --> 01:18:13.641
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't run,</v>

2876
01:18:13.641 --> 01:18:14.930
<v Speaker 5>man does is in a tournament.</v>

2877
01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:17.480
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] get the fuck out of here.</v>

2878
01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:18.800
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2879
01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.520
<v Speaker 5>I didn't show up to,</v>

2880
01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.040
<v Speaker 5>to take second place.</v>

2881
01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:26.350
<v Speaker 5>I showed up to take first or die trying and uh,</v>

2882
01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:27.561
<v Speaker 5>fuck it,</v>

2883
01:18:27.561 --> 01:18:28.160
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2884
01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.860
<v Speaker 5>But why do you think that that it's better to have a tournament?</v>

2885
01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:31.850
<v Speaker 5>Like what is it about it?</v>

2886
01:18:31.851 --> 01:18:34.310
<v Speaker 5>Just because the public anticipates having those fights,</v>

2887
01:18:34.311 --> 01:18:35.510
<v Speaker 5>watching how it plays out.</v>

2888
01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.320
<v Speaker 5>Interesting to see how,</v>

2889
01:18:37.321 --> 01:18:37.581
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2890
01:18:37.581 --> 01:18:37.851
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>

2891
01:18:37.851 --> 01:18:38.840
<v Speaker 5>look at March madness.</v>

2892
01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.400
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the biggest things ever.</v>

2893
01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.720
<v Speaker 5>And if it wasn't a tournament,</v>

2894
01:18:41.721 --> 01:18:43.070
<v Speaker 5>people would not be as excited.</v>

2895
01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.140
<v Speaker 5>But that's a terminal over a long period of time.</v>

2896
01:18:45.141 --> 01:18:46.670
<v Speaker 5>They're not to a bunch of games in a night.</v>

2897
01:18:46.671 --> 01:18:49.040
<v Speaker 5>That's actually a perfect example of why it doesn't apply,</v>

2898
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:50.510
<v Speaker 5>but it just,</v>

2899
01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:53.660
<v Speaker 5>I just mean the concept of tournaments and even doing tournament's over over</v>

2900
01:18:53.661 --> 01:18:54.051
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

2901
01:18:54.051 --> 01:18:54.831
<v Speaker 5>it's still great to,</v>

2902
01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:57.260
<v Speaker 5>but the one night tournament is,</v>

2903
01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:58.420
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2904
01:18:58.420 --> 01:18:59.780
<v Speaker 5>let's see who comes out on top.</v>

2905
01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:02.240
<v Speaker 5>Plus it's a great way to try and read,</v>

2906
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:04.700
<v Speaker 5>establish a orders.</v>

2907
01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:05.890
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>

2908
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:06.081
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

2909
01:19:06.081 --> 01:19:07.640
<v Speaker 5>let's say you have a whole bunch of pool,</v>

2910
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.970
<v Speaker 5>they got a handful of all these guys and you don't know who really fits where,</v>

2911
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.470
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

2912
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:13.760
<v Speaker 5>they go through this one night tournament.</v>

2913
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.961
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2914
01:19:13.961 --> 01:19:14.541
<v Speaker 5>there's a winner.</v>

2915
01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:17.620
<v Speaker 5>Someone was able to gut it out and come out on top and come over,</v>

2916
01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.270
<v Speaker 5>come out with all that dealing with all that adversity.</v>

2917
01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.200
<v Speaker 5>And then you look down the line like who did what?</v>

2918
01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:26.540
<v Speaker 5>And then even the guy who did the worst and the tournament,</v>

2919
01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:28.910
<v Speaker 5>let's say all of a sudden non tournament style,</v>

2920
01:19:28.911 --> 01:19:30.770
<v Speaker 5>they start racking up the wins and it's like,</v>

2921
01:19:30.771 --> 01:19:31.431
<v Speaker 5>Oh wow,</v>

2922
01:19:31.431 --> 01:19:31.761
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2923
01:19:31.761 --> 01:19:32.630
<v Speaker 5>look at that story.</v>

2924
01:19:32.631 --> 01:19:37.010
<v Speaker 5>That person's coming back from what we consider to be a disaster and now their</v>

2925
01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.540
<v Speaker 5>Phoenix rising from the ashes.</v>

2926
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:40.910
<v Speaker 5>It gives such an opportunity to uh,</v>

2927
01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.320
<v Speaker 5>to exempt,</v>

2928
01:19:42.321 --> 01:19:43.640
<v Speaker 5>to show human spirit,</v>

2929
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:45.920
<v Speaker 5>to show overcoming adversity.</v>

2930
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:48.510
<v Speaker 5>And it's an instant trade off.</v>

2931
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:51.110
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a great idea for grappling.</v>

2932
01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:53.330
<v Speaker 5>Eddie Bravo had the Eddie Bravo invitational,</v>

2933
01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:57.260
<v Speaker 5>the Ebi last week and it was a tournament and it was really exciting to watch,</v>

2934
01:19:57.261 --> 01:20:00.380
<v Speaker 5>watch guys make it to the finals and watch guys,</v>

2935
01:20:00.381 --> 01:20:00.591
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2936
01:20:00.591 --> 01:20:02.120
<v Speaker 5>you see the brackets play out.</v>

2937
01:20:02.150 --> 01:20:03.380
<v Speaker 5>I think it's great for grappling.</v>

2938
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:05.510
<v Speaker 5>What I worry about it is with head injuries.</v>

2939
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:08.220
<v Speaker 5>I worry about guys fighting the first round,</v>

2940
01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:09.660
<v Speaker 5>getting their bell rang,</v>

2941
01:20:09.661 --> 01:20:11.460
<v Speaker 5>having some internal bleeding perhaps.</v>

2942
01:20:11.461 --> 01:20:12.510
<v Speaker 5>And then fighting in the final.</v>

2943
01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:12.890
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2944
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:14.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that the medical,</v>

2945
01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:15.533
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2946
01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:16.280
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2947
01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:17.600
<v Speaker 5>observation should be,</v>

2948
01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:18.180
<v Speaker 5>should be,</v>

2949
01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.200
<v Speaker 5>should be overlooked.</v>

2950
01:20:19.201 --> 01:20:20.130
<v Speaker 5>I think that's important.</v>

2951
01:20:20.131 --> 01:20:20.461
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2952
01:20:20.461 --> 01:20:21.210
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2953
01:20:21.210 --> 01:20:22.190
<v Speaker 5>I really think tournaments,</v>

2954
01:20:22.191 --> 01:20:24.850
<v Speaker 5>we would help bring some excitement back to him and May,</v>

2955
01:20:24.851 --> 01:20:26.190
<v Speaker 5>but then here's the other thing,</v>

2956
01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:28.140
<v Speaker 5>I think five minute rounds are not long enough.</v>

2957
01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:29.670
<v Speaker 5>I think we do a 10 minute rounds,</v>

2958
01:20:29.671 --> 01:20:30.540
<v Speaker 5>at the very least.</v>

2959
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:31.500
<v Speaker 5>I knew.</v>

2960
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:32.200
<v Speaker 5>Agree.</v>

2961
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.960
<v Speaker 5>I see you nodding your head over there guys.</v>

2962
01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:38.860
<v Speaker 5>Let's not even talk about how the 10 point must system doesn't belong in MMA.</v>

2963
01:20:38.890 --> 01:20:39.780
<v Speaker 5>Not all terrible,</v>

2964
01:20:39.810 --> 01:20:40.560
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2965
01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:41.393
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2966
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:45.570
<v Speaker 5>and I understood why they use the 10 point because it's to try and keep people</v>

2967
01:20:45.571 --> 01:20:46.404
<v Speaker 5>honest.</v>

2968
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:50.340
<v Speaker 5>All you can see that they scored the round that there no one's sitting.</v>

2969
01:20:50.341 --> 01:20:52.140
<v Speaker 5>That's as it's been explained to me.</v>

2970
01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.340
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

2971
01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:54.131
<v Speaker 5>well they just borrowed,</v>

2972
01:20:54.131 --> 01:20:54.791
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't box.</v>

2973
01:20:54.791 --> 01:20:55.640
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't need it.</v>

2974
01:20:55.641 --> 01:20:55.930
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2975
01:20:55.930 --> 01:20:56.370
<v Speaker 5>he just,</v>

2976
01:20:56.370 --> 01:20:56.941
<v Speaker 5>I liked it.</v>

2977
01:20:56.941 --> 01:20:59.060
<v Speaker 5>And Japan where they just look okay.</v>

2978
01:20:59.310 --> 01:20:59.850
<v Speaker 5>And pancreas,</v>

2979
01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:02.640
<v Speaker 5>it used to be two judges on the outside and the ref,</v>

2980
01:21:03.630 --> 01:21:05.730
<v Speaker 5>their judgements at the end,</v>

2981
01:21:05.731 --> 01:21:08.040
<v Speaker 5>if they decide all three of them convene up,</v>

2982
01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.113
<v Speaker 5>he won.</v>

2983
01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:09.631
<v Speaker 5>I see,</v>

2984
01:21:09.631 --> 01:21:13.800
<v Speaker 5>I disagree with that using the ref cause I think a referee should,</v>

2985
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:15.900
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a very singular job.</v>

2986
01:21:15.901 --> 01:21:18.720
<v Speaker 5>And I think the referee's job should be making sure that I can,</v>

2987
01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:19.613
<v Speaker 5>I can see,</v>

2988
01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:20.850
<v Speaker 5>I can see the argument.</v>

2989
01:21:21.150 --> 01:21:22.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying how it used to be,</v>

2990
01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.400
<v Speaker 5>but even still,</v>

2991
01:21:23.401 --> 01:21:24.630
<v Speaker 5>no matter what the idea was.</v>

2992
01:21:24.631 --> 01:21:24.781
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2993
01:21:24.781 --> 01:21:25.830
<v Speaker 5>and back in pride,</v>

2994
01:21:25.831 --> 01:21:26.100
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

2995
01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:27.030
<v Speaker 5>you had your criteria.</v>

2996
01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:29.940
<v Speaker 5>Matt would sit ringside with a piece of paper,</v>

2997
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:32.980
<v Speaker 5>one name and then another name and a line down the middle for each side.</v>

2998
01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:37.510
<v Speaker 5>And he would sit there and he would put hash marks and each box and those hash</v>

2999
01:21:37.511 --> 01:21:40.440
<v Speaker 5>marks meant something along those criteria that were,</v>

3000
01:21:40.441 --> 01:21:41.274
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3001
01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.300
<v Speaker 5>that were important that he could look back and it would help him remember how</v>

3002
01:21:45.301 --> 01:21:46.134
<v Speaker 5>this fight went.</v>

3003
01:21:46.290 --> 01:21:46.431
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3004
01:21:46.431 --> 01:21:46.661
<v Speaker 5>Matt,</v>

3005
01:21:46.661 --> 01:21:47.760
<v Speaker 5>it's an excellent referee.</v>

3006
01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:48.511
<v Speaker 5>Oh well yeah.</v>

3007
01:21:48.511 --> 01:21:48.691
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3008
01:21:48.691 --> 01:21:49.950
<v Speaker 5>and this is just same as a judge,</v>

3009
01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:51.293
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

3010
01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:53.310
<v Speaker 5>so I agree with,</v>

3011
01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:54.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm more towards that side,</v>

3012
01:21:54.721 --> 01:21:57.900
<v Speaker 5>but even still now you see guys just gaming a five minute round,</v>

3013
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:59.820
<v Speaker 5>stifling doing this,</v>

3014
01:21:59.821 --> 01:22:00.301
<v Speaker 5>doing that,</v>

3015
01:22:00.301 --> 01:22:02.520
<v Speaker 5>and then petering off to the fucking,</v>

3016
01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:04.080
<v Speaker 5>the stool coming back out.</v>

3017
01:22:04.081 --> 01:22:08.310
<v Speaker 5>And just trying to run the same thing or when two out of three and then they</v>

3018
01:22:08.311 --> 01:22:09.730
<v Speaker 5>walk out and look at me.</v>

3019
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.961
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3020
01:22:09.961 --> 01:22:10.081
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3021
01:22:10.081 --> 01:22:11.850
<v Speaker 5>you didn't even really try to kick that guy's ass.</v>

3022
01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.970
<v Speaker 5>Well at one have fun with that.</v>

3023
01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.640
<v Speaker 5>What do you think about standups?</v>

3024
01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:19.290
<v Speaker 5>Do you think the standup should be a part of MMA?</v>

3025
01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:19.890
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

3026
01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:20.370
<v Speaker 5>you do,</v>

3027
01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:22.770
<v Speaker 5>but that has to be with the other thing with him.</v>

3028
01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.101
<v Speaker 5>Amazing.</v>

3029
01:22:23.101 --> 01:22:26.100
<v Speaker 5>He needs to be more attention to stalling.</v>

3030
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.570
<v Speaker 5>If you're not trying to finish your opponent and damage them,</v>

3031
01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:31.404
<v Speaker 5>take them out.</v>

3032
01:22:31.770 --> 01:22:32.603
<v Speaker 5>You're stolen.</v>

3033
01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:34.950
<v Speaker 5>What do you think about if they do have rounds?</v>

3034
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.170
<v Speaker 5>Like say if you go a 10 minute round,</v>

3035
01:22:37.230 --> 01:22:38.190
<v Speaker 5>at the end of 10 minutes,</v>

3036
01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:38.501
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

3037
01:22:38.501 --> 01:22:39.570
<v Speaker 5>you're on top of the guy.</v>

3038
01:22:39.571 --> 01:22:40.170
<v Speaker 5>Mount doom.</v>

3039
01:22:40.170 --> 01:22:40.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3040
01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:42.570
<v Speaker 5>Start right back with the mount on the second round.</v>

3041
01:22:43.050 --> 01:22:44.460
<v Speaker 5>That's an interesting concept.</v>

3042
01:22:44.461 --> 01:22:45.001
<v Speaker 5>But a,</v>

3043
01:22:45.001 --> 01:22:46.800
<v Speaker 5>I like standing in backup on the feet again,</v>

3044
01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.290
<v Speaker 5>but why that gives us striker a big advantage.</v>

3045
01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:51.090
<v Speaker 5>You need to be a well rounded fighter,</v>

3046
01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:51.501
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3047
01:22:51.501 --> 01:22:53.550
<v Speaker 5>But if you work so hard to get a guy to the ground,</v>

3048
01:22:53.551 --> 01:22:55.230
<v Speaker 5>he didn't earn getting back up to his feet.</v>

3049
01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:56.820
<v Speaker 5>Why should he be able to get back up to his feet?</v>

3050
01:22:56.850 --> 01:22:56.941
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3051
01:22:56.941 --> 01:23:00.200
<v Speaker 5>that's the whole concept of rounds is the restart of the contest.</v>

3052
01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.080
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3053
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.480
<v Speaker 5>Restart of you getting a chance to get back up.</v>

3054
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:04.343
<v Speaker 5>That's true too.</v>

3055
01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:04.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3056
01:23:04.930 --> 01:23:06.400
<v Speaker 5>So if he can survive the round,</v>

3057
01:23:06.401 --> 01:23:06.901
<v Speaker 5>what does that mean?</v>

3058
01:23:06.901 --> 01:23:07.030
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>

3059
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:08.560
<v Speaker 5>if it is that dire to you,</v>

3060
01:23:08.561 --> 01:23:13.240
<v Speaker 5>that you cannot afford to have that guy ever get back to his feet either by the</v>

3061
01:23:13.241 --> 01:23:17.830
<v Speaker 5>round ending or by him escaping or the referee standing up for an activity.</v>

3062
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:18.480
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3063
01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.313
<v Speaker 5>one,</v>

3064
01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:21.420
<v Speaker 5>you're fucked as a fight or anyways,</v>

3065
01:23:21.421 --> 01:23:21.580
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

3066
01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:22.960
<v Speaker 5>you have a huge deficit.</v>

3067
01:23:23.410 --> 01:23:24.243
<v Speaker 5>Number two,</v>

3068
01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:25.090
<v Speaker 5>you better finish him,</v>

3069
01:23:25.330 --> 01:23:25.840
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3070
01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:26.631
<v Speaker 5>You better finish them.</v>

3071
01:23:26.631 --> 01:23:27.290
<v Speaker 5>That also goes to,</v>

3072
01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:27.431
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

3073
01:23:27.431 --> 01:23:27.611
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3074
01:23:27.611 --> 01:23:30.400
<v Speaker 5>if you're the greatest grappler submission guy in the world and you have no</v>

3075
01:23:30.401 --> 01:23:32.770
<v Speaker 5>takedowns enjoy getting your ass kicked.</v>

3076
01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:33.101
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3077
01:23:33.101 --> 01:23:36.850
<v Speaker 5>there's a few fighters that are really good at holding guys down and I don't</v>

3078
01:23:36.851 --> 01:23:39.430
<v Speaker 5>think there's anything wrong with that because I think it's important to know</v>

3079
01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:40.510
<v Speaker 5>that a guy can hold you down.</v>

3080
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:41.560
<v Speaker 5>Like Ben aspirins.</v>

3081
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:42.640
<v Speaker 5>My perfect example,</v>

3082
01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:46.960
<v Speaker 5>Ben Asterisk is such a good fucking wrestler that he gets ahold of guys and he</v>

3083
01:23:46.961 --> 01:23:49.150
<v Speaker 5>puts them on their back and they can't get back up.</v>

3084
01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.680
<v Speaker 5>And if that's the case,</v>

3085
01:23:50.681 --> 01:23:54.910
<v Speaker 5>like standing a guy giving a guy a free shot to stand back up because Ben asked</v>

3086
01:23:54.911 --> 01:23:55.040
<v Speaker 5>her,</v>

3087
01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.630
<v Speaker 5>may or may not be as active as you would like or it might,</v>

3088
01:23:58.631 --> 01:24:02.210
<v Speaker 5>but still the guy who was on the bottom wants to get up but you can't.</v>

3089
01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:02.680
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3090
01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.281
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

3091
01:24:03.281 --> 01:24:04.540
<v Speaker 5>you've got 10 minutes to work.</v>

3092
01:24:04.541 --> 01:24:06.400
<v Speaker 5>I F I C and uh,</v>

3093
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:07.930
<v Speaker 5>I think honestly with 10 minutes,</v>

3094
01:24:07.931 --> 01:24:11.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't think ask him wouldn't have as many decisions as he does because we'll</v>

3095
01:24:11.291 --> 01:24:13.390
<v Speaker 5>ask her and has kept a lot of people on their back.</v>

3096
01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:16.360
<v Speaker 5>I've seen him work a lot too looking for submissions.</v>

3097
01:24:16.361 --> 01:24:17.194
<v Speaker 5>Punching.</v>

3098
01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.290
<v Speaker 5>He's not a power puncher would you say?</v>

3099
01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:20.350
<v Speaker 5>He's up til a puncher,</v>

3100
01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:23.200
<v Speaker 5>but one FC allows them to do knees to the head on the ground.</v>

3101
01:24:23.201 --> 01:24:23.710
<v Speaker 5>That makes a big,</v>

3102
01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:25.060
<v Speaker 5>that's another thing I would change,</v>

3103
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:26.990
<v Speaker 5>I think needs of the head soccer kicked,</v>

3104
01:24:26.991 --> 01:24:27.311
<v Speaker 5>stomped,</v>

3105
01:24:27.311 --> 01:24:27.521
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3106
01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:28.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm all for all that.</v>

3107
01:24:28.661 --> 01:24:29.590
<v Speaker 5>But at the very least,</v>

3108
01:24:29.591 --> 01:24:31.540
<v Speaker 5>knees to the head change things and uh,</v>

3109
01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:32.350
<v Speaker 5>a lot,</v>

3110
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:33.610
<v Speaker 5>especially even for the grappler.</v>

3111
01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:34.600
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3112
01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.960
<v Speaker 5>but with 10 minutes you want to call Ben Aspirin boring.</v>

3113
01:24:37.961 --> 01:24:40.240
<v Speaker 5>I think in 10 minutes he's got finishes.</v>

3114
01:24:41.050 --> 01:24:41.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3115
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:42.550
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>

3116
01:24:42.551 --> 01:24:43.384
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3117
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:44.680
<v Speaker 5>a lot of guys would have finishes,</v>

3118
01:24:44.681 --> 01:24:47.080
<v Speaker 5>but the other thing that changes that is when a ref is standing over the top</v>

3119
01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:47.350
<v Speaker 5>going,</v>

3120
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:48.183
<v Speaker 5>action,</v>

3121
01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:49.203
<v Speaker 5>action.</v>

3122
01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:49.720
<v Speaker 5>Action.</v>

3123
01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:50.553
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3124
01:24:50.770 --> 01:24:51.310
<v Speaker 5>get up.</v>

3125
01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:52.030
<v Speaker 5>You're stalling.</v>

3126
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.391
<v Speaker 5>Your cool.</v>

3127
01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:52.751
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3128
01:24:52.751 --> 01:24:53.510
<v Speaker 5>when a guy is stalling,</v>

3129
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:54.430
<v Speaker 5>you don't want a guy is not.</v>

3130
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.301
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3131
01:24:55.301 --> 01:24:57.340
<v Speaker 5>but I think a guy who's stalling,</v>

3132
01:24:57.341 --> 01:24:58.930
<v Speaker 5>if you can't get that guy off you,</v>

3133
01:24:58.931 --> 01:24:59.890
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

3134
01:24:59.910 --> 01:25:01.420
<v Speaker 5>Well that's a different fight then.</v>

3135
01:25:01.421 --> 01:25:03.400
<v Speaker 5>That's that settle because the guy you are,</v>

3136
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:04.181
<v Speaker 5>you're on the bottom.</v>

3137
01:25:04.181 --> 01:25:05.014
<v Speaker 5>You're still fighting.</v>

3138
01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:05.350
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3139
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.770
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3140
01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:06.970
<v Speaker 5>I hear you that way.</v>

3141
01:25:07.330 --> 01:25:09.580
<v Speaker 5>But we're talking about prize fighting.</v>

3142
01:25:09.610 --> 01:25:09.790
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3143
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:10.590
<v Speaker 5>Entertainment.</v>

3144
01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:11.170
<v Speaker 5>Mm.</v>

3145
01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:11.620
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3146
01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:11.851
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>

3147
01:25:11.851 --> 01:25:12.091
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

3148
01:25:12.091 --> 01:25:12.251
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

3149
01:25:12.251 --> 01:25:15.970
<v Speaker 5>if it's the fight that you're talking about that's not for entertainment,</v>

3150
01:25:15.971 --> 01:25:17.140
<v Speaker 5>no one wants to pay to see that.</v>

3151
01:25:17.141 --> 01:25:17.974
<v Speaker 5>You know what that is?</v>

3152
01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:20.590
<v Speaker 5>That's catch wrestling in the 18 hundreds.</v>

3153
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:26.070
<v Speaker 5>That's pro wrestling in the 19 hundreds where three hours plus of guys trying to</v>

3154
01:25:26.081 --> 01:25:30.910
<v Speaker 5>get an advantage and can't because they're so well versed of each other.</v>

3155
01:25:30.911 --> 01:25:31.631
<v Speaker 5>They're so tough.</v>

3156
01:25:31.631 --> 01:25:32.351
<v Speaker 5>They're so skilled.</v>

3157
01:25:32.351 --> 01:25:33.850
<v Speaker 5>One guy getting stuck on the bottom,</v>

3158
01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:34.840
<v Speaker 5>he can't get up.</v>

3159
01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:35.891
<v Speaker 5>There's no restarts,</v>

3160
01:25:35.891 --> 01:25:36.611
<v Speaker 5>there's no nothing.</v>

3161
01:25:36.611 --> 01:25:37.360
<v Speaker 5>There's no,</v>

3162
01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:38.140
<v Speaker 5>there it goes.</v>

3163
01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.460
<v Speaker 5>Let's see when that first fall comes,</v>

3164
01:25:39.461 --> 01:25:40.690
<v Speaker 5>but that died out.</v>

3165
01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:41.553
<v Speaker 5>It didn't work.</v>

3166
01:25:41.650 --> 01:25:44.140
<v Speaker 5>If you look at like say like what they were doing with a lead Xc,</v>

3167
01:25:44.141 --> 01:25:46.900
<v Speaker 5>that's like the worst case example of trying to make it an entertainment.</v>

3168
01:25:46.930 --> 01:25:47.760
<v Speaker 5>Sure,</v>

3169
01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:48.100
<v Speaker 5>sure,</v>

3170
01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:51.100
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not suggesting that you just do it on the DC.</v>

3171
01:25:51.130 --> 01:25:51.851
<v Speaker 5>Do they used to make,</v>

3172
01:25:51.851 --> 01:25:52.411
<v Speaker 5>they used to Dan,</v>

3173
01:25:52.411 --> 01:25:53.244
<v Speaker 5>Dan people.</v>

3174
01:25:54.130 --> 01:25:55.390
<v Speaker 5>They would take seconds on the ground.</v>

3175
01:25:55.391 --> 01:25:56.240
<v Speaker 5>They stand you back up.</v>

3176
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:57.550
<v Speaker 5>He stood up big country.</v>

3177
01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:01.960
<v Speaker 5>He was on top of our Lawsky inside control working with Kamora or would you call</v>

3178
01:26:01.961 --> 01:26:02.560
<v Speaker 5>it double risk?</v>

3179
01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.400
<v Speaker 5>I've devoted like,</v>

3180
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:03.621
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

3181
01:26:03.621 --> 01:26:04.460
<v Speaker 5>Now he,</v>

3182
01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.050
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he was ever going to get it,</v>

3183
01:26:06.170 --> 01:26:08.070
<v Speaker 5>but he was in an advantage.</v>

3184
01:26:08.071 --> 01:26:08.631
<v Speaker 5>His position,</v>

3185
01:26:08.631 --> 01:26:09.800
<v Speaker 5>he was working for a finish.</v>

3186
01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.300
<v Speaker 5>He should not have been stood up and he's an expert in that particular style of</v>

3187
01:26:14.301 --> 01:26:14.661
<v Speaker 5>fighting.</v>

3188
01:26:14.661 --> 01:26:15.650
<v Speaker 5>He's in a submission next,</v>

3189
01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.900
<v Speaker 5>he's a ground guy and he wasn't just laying on him.</v>

3190
01:26:17.901 --> 01:26:20.890
<v Speaker 5>He was trying to submit our Lawsky and uh,</v>

3191
01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:21.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3192
01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:23.570
<v Speaker 5>of course with anything you need,</v>

3193
01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:27.740
<v Speaker 5>even as a sports sits now we need better referees and we need better judges.</v>

3194
01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:29.533
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3195
01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:30.291
<v Speaker 5>That stoppage.</v>

3196
01:26:30.291 --> 01:26:33.170
<v Speaker 5>Last week they reversed that.</v>

3197
01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:33.351
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3198
01:26:33.351 --> 01:26:34.430
<v Speaker 5>did they reversed it?</v>

3199
01:26:34.431 --> 01:26:34.641
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3200
01:26:34.641 --> 01:26:35.540
<v Speaker 5>it's a no contest.</v>

3201
01:26:35.541 --> 01:26:37.010
<v Speaker 5>Even when Faber's down,</v>

3202
01:26:37.011 --> 01:26:39.890
<v Speaker 5>they're getting walloped on his shoulder and it's like,</v>

3203
01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:40.993
<v Speaker 5>show me something.</v>

3204
01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:42.913
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

3205
01:26:43.450 --> 01:26:45.020
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't see his thumbs up.</v>

3206
01:26:45.021 --> 01:26:45.854
<v Speaker 5>I got it.</v>

3207
01:26:46.190 --> 01:26:47.090
<v Speaker 5>On the second hand,</v>

3208
01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.000
<v Speaker 5>you can tell he's not getting his ass kicked right now.</v>

3209
01:26:50.630 --> 01:26:51.463
<v Speaker 5>Let it go.</v>

3210
01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:55.250
<v Speaker 5>Let them go when a guy's turtling and the guy was just hitting your gloves and</v>

3211
01:26:55.251 --> 01:26:56.084
<v Speaker 5>arms.</v>

3212
01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:57.200
<v Speaker 5>And then if I get stopped,</v>

3213
01:26:57.201 --> 01:26:58.220
<v Speaker 5>that is very frustrating.</v>

3214
01:26:58.221 --> 01:26:59.120
<v Speaker 5>It is this problem with that.</v>

3215
01:26:59.121 --> 01:27:00.980
<v Speaker 5>But I watched all these fights back in the day.</v>

3216
01:27:00.981 --> 01:27:03.950
<v Speaker 5>I'd seen dudes getting shellshocked on top,</v>

3217
01:27:03.951 --> 01:27:08.030
<v Speaker 5>just just artillery dropped on him and surviving it.</v>

3218
01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.650
<v Speaker 5>Then reversing the fight.</v>

3219
01:27:09.651 --> 01:27:10.520
<v Speaker 5>Dude's all totally,</v>

3220
01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:15.500
<v Speaker 5>totally petered out and Brock Lesnar changes and just kicking the shit out of</v>

3221
01:27:15.501 --> 01:27:15.650
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

3222
01:27:15.650 --> 01:27:16.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3223
01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:16.670
<v Speaker 5>it happens.</v>

3224
01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:17.720
<v Speaker 5>And Brock Lesnar and car when,</v>

3225
01:27:17.721 --> 01:27:18.710
<v Speaker 5>that's a good example too,</v>

3226
01:27:18.711 --> 01:27:20.900
<v Speaker 5>but no one wants to let that happen anymore.</v>

3227
01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:21.771
<v Speaker 5>Well as too brutal.</v>

3228
01:27:21.771 --> 01:27:21.941
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3229
01:27:21.941 --> 01:27:22.251
<v Speaker 5>we're not,</v>

3230
01:27:22.251 --> 01:27:22.731
<v Speaker 5>we're fighting.</v>

3231
01:27:22.731 --> 01:27:23.750
<v Speaker 5>We're not doing patty cake.</v>

3232
01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:24.261
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3233
01:27:24.261 --> 01:27:28.160
<v Speaker 5>there's always that thing about trying to make it more appealing to the</v>

3234
01:27:28.161 --> 01:27:29.060
<v Speaker 5>mainstream.</v>

3235
01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:30.950
<v Speaker 5>It will be better for everybody,</v>

3236
01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:34.850
<v Speaker 5>and yet it's not better for the people that are actually doing it.</v>

3237
01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:35.360
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3238
01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:39.110
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely not better for someone who gets stuck in a position and they</v>

3239
01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.420
<v Speaker 5>intelligently defend yourself.</v>

3240
01:27:41.421 --> 01:27:41.571
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3241
01:27:41.571 --> 01:27:42.404
<v Speaker 5>guess what?</v>

3242
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:44.690
<v Speaker 5>There's some positions where willing guys wailing on you.</v>

3243
01:27:44.691 --> 01:27:46.610
<v Speaker 5>It's intelligent to just cover up.</v>

3244
01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.120
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

3245
01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.920
<v Speaker 5>Remember a tank and a seven,</v>

3246
01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:52.470
<v Speaker 5>seven kept palm striking him and just throwing all these shots and the seven</v>

3247
01:27:52.471 --> 01:27:52.910
<v Speaker 5>wasn't,</v>

3248
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:55.640
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't palm striking because you're not a punch just because he didn't want</v>

3249
01:27:55.641 --> 01:27:56.474
<v Speaker 5>to break his hand.</v>

3250
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:57.530
<v Speaker 5>No gloves,</v>

3251
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:58.363
<v Speaker 5>no wraps.</v>

3252
01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:00.800
<v Speaker 5>So he smack and a tank,</v>

3253
01:28:00.801 --> 01:28:01.340
<v Speaker 5>the tank,</v>

3254
01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:02.270
<v Speaker 5>he tries to get up,</v>

3255
01:28:02.271 --> 01:28:03.104
<v Speaker 5>but he can't.</v>

3256
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:04.183
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

3257
01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.590
<v Speaker 5>one of these modern reps are probably stopped that fight.</v>

3258
01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:06.771
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3259
01:28:06.771 --> 01:28:08.210
<v Speaker 5>you're not intelligent that defending yourself.</v>

3260
01:28:08.630 --> 01:28:10.160
<v Speaker 5>He's not going to go out.</v>

3261
01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:12.110
<v Speaker 5>He's not getting his bell rung.</v>

3262
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:14.090
<v Speaker 5>He's not getting the shit kicked out of him.</v>

3263
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:15.920
<v Speaker 5>He just can't get up right now.</v>

3264
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:17.241
<v Speaker 5>Frank talked about,</v>

3265
01:28:17.241 --> 01:28:17.411
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3266
01:28:17.411 --> 01:28:18.680
<v Speaker 5>when a tank talked about it,</v>

3267
01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:20.000
<v Speaker 5>he said a hell nightmare.</v>

3268
01:28:20.001 --> 01:28:21.750
<v Speaker 5>I was getting molested by Freddie Mercury.</v>

3269
01:28:21.751 --> 01:28:22.584
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3270
01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:23.920
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3271
01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:24.150
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3272
01:28:24.150 --> 01:28:24.660
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3273
01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:26.450
<v Speaker 5>and tank tried to get up.</v>

3274
01:28:26.451 --> 01:28:26.750
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>

3275
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:28.010
<v Speaker 5>he was just getting controlled.</v>

3276
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:29.300
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't get up at seven.</v>

3277
01:28:29.301 --> 01:28:31.040
<v Speaker 5>Didn't have the ability to really finish him either.</v>

3278
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.430
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3279
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:33.260
<v Speaker 5>So it is what it is.</v>

3280
01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:33.981
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>

3281
01:28:33.981 --> 01:28:34.330
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3282
01:28:34.330 --> 01:28:35.510
<v Speaker 5>I needed to keep going,</v>

3283
01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:36.770
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think that should be stood up.</v>

3284
01:28:36.771 --> 01:28:37.430
<v Speaker 5>What about,</v>

3285
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.731
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3286
01:28:37.731 --> 01:28:40.430
<v Speaker 5>not in that case cause cause seven was incredibly active.</v>

3287
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.940
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3288
01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:41.870
<v Speaker 5>He was trying,</v>

3289
01:28:41.871 --> 01:28:43.430
<v Speaker 5>he just didn't really have the,</v>

3290
01:28:43.770 --> 01:28:44.290
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3291
01:28:44.290 --> 01:28:44.940
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3292
01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:46.370
<v Speaker 5>the scalability yet.</v>

3293
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:47.690
<v Speaker 5>And here's another one.</v>

3294
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:51.710
<v Speaker 5>Ruan Pot's getting punched in the ribs and then stopping it because he's just,</v>

3295
01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:52.870
<v Speaker 5>he's stuffing Elton.</v>

3296
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:53.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3297
01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:54.020
<v Speaker 5>Do you see him tapping?</v>

3298
01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:54.680
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3299
01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:56.180
<v Speaker 5>Do you see him saying I want out?</v>

3300
01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.073
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3301
01:28:57.230 --> 01:28:57.471
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3302
01:28:57.471 --> 01:28:59.870
<v Speaker 5>I didn't agree with and I know how much he's getting punched in the fucking</v>

3303
01:28:59.871 --> 01:29:00.230
<v Speaker 5>ribs.</v>

3304
01:29:00.230 --> 01:29:01.590
<v Speaker 5>Did Adam get punched in the ribs?</v>

3305
01:29:01.591 --> 01:29:04.440
<v Speaker 5>They stopped that fight just to rescue everybody from how boring it was.</v>

3306
01:29:04.710 --> 01:29:06.930
<v Speaker 5>Cause he was just on top of him punching him in the same spot.</v>

3307
01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:07.710
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's like this.</v>

3308
01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:08.310
<v Speaker 5>We've seen it now.</v>

3309
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:09.170
<v Speaker 5>Who Look at that Bruce.</v>

3310
01:29:09.171 --> 01:29:09.930
<v Speaker 5>So what?</v>

3311
01:29:09.930 --> 01:29:10.950
<v Speaker 5>It is bruised.</v>

3312
01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:12.030
<v Speaker 5>This is a bruise.</v>

3313
01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:12.873
<v Speaker 5>Very bad.</v>

3314
01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:15.720
<v Speaker 5>So sore tomorrow he's going to have a black and blue spot.</v>

3315
01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:17.573
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3316
01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:18.880
<v Speaker 5>A real black and blues Paul.</v>

3317
01:29:18.881 --> 01:29:19.281
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

3318
01:29:19.281 --> 01:29:20.970
<v Speaker 5>And I even turned yellow and purple at some point.</v>

3319
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.050
<v Speaker 5>It could very well turn like orange Ygrene.</v>

3320
01:29:24.090 --> 01:29:25.170
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>

3321
01:29:25.171 --> 01:29:26.010
<v Speaker 5>we can't allow that.</v>

3322
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.903
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>

3323
01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:28.230
<v Speaker 5>What if stand them up?</v>

3324
01:29:28.290 --> 01:29:29.123
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3325
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3326
01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.050
<v Speaker 5>Or stop the fight all together.</v>

3327
01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:32.580
<v Speaker 5>That's not intelligent defense.</v>

3328
01:29:32.610 --> 01:29:33.450
<v Speaker 5>There's not enough.</v>

3329
01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.460
<v Speaker 5>There's certain guys that fight in the UFC.</v>

3330
01:29:35.461 --> 01:29:36.180
<v Speaker 5>We got to go,</v>

3331
01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:36.600
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3332
01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.130
<v Speaker 5>who the fuck let you fight in the UFC?</v>

3333
01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.930
<v Speaker 5>Well they need a lot of fighters.</v>

3334
01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.640
<v Speaker 5>They have so many events,</v>

3335
01:29:41.670 --> 01:29:42.331
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

3336
01:29:42.331 --> 01:29:42.871
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

3337
01:29:42.871 --> 01:29:43.770
<v Speaker 5>so many events.</v>

3338
01:29:43.771 --> 01:29:46.150
<v Speaker 5>They got to fill them up and there's just too many.</v>

3339
01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:47.173
<v Speaker 5>Do you think there's too many?</v>

3340
01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:47.710
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3341
01:29:47.710 --> 01:29:48.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah I do.</v>

3342
01:29:48.090 --> 01:29:48.923
<v Speaker 5>There are,</v>

3343
01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:49.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3344
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:54.360
<v Speaker 5>they have a plan for what they're trying to accomplish and this is what they see</v>

3345
01:29:54.361 --> 01:29:54.871
<v Speaker 5>is the,</v>

3346
01:29:54.871 --> 01:29:55.830
<v Speaker 5>is the path to doing.</v>

3347
01:29:55.831 --> 01:29:56.100
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3348
01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:57.120
<v Speaker 5>you know what I think there should be,</v>

3349
01:29:57.150 --> 01:29:58.920
<v Speaker 5>I think should be an a league and a B league.</v>

3350
01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.470
<v Speaker 5>I agree that there should be a UFC and a strike force.</v>

3351
01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:02.333
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

3352
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:07.430
<v Speaker 5>If that fight should have one headliner type dude or one main card type guy and</v>

3353
01:30:07.561 --> 01:30:08.850
<v Speaker 5>arrested just up and comers.</v>

3354
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:09.331
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3355
01:30:09.331 --> 01:30:09.870
<v Speaker 5>why not?</v>

3356
01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:10.141
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3357
01:30:10.141 --> 01:30:12.540
<v Speaker 5>and then those guys will graduate to become,</v>

3358
01:30:12.570 --> 01:30:13.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3359
01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:13.620
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3360
01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:14.520
<v Speaker 5>can you imagine if it,</v>

3361
01:30:14.521 --> 01:30:15.690
<v Speaker 5>you even even this,</v>

3362
01:30:15.691 --> 01:30:16.260
<v Speaker 5>what if,</v>

3363
01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:21.260
<v Speaker 5>what if they kept Strikeforce and UFC and let's say Strikeforce went pride style</v>

3364
01:30:22.830 --> 01:30:27.810
<v Speaker 5>and UFC was the UFC and then they had a super bowl match every year and each</v>

3365
01:30:27.810 --> 01:30:29.280
<v Speaker 5>year with switch one this year.</v>

3366
01:30:29.281 --> 01:30:30.000
<v Speaker 5>It's pride.</v>

3367
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.970
<v Speaker 5>It's pride world rules this year at UFC rules.</v>

3368
01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:34.223
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>

3369
01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:35.370
<v Speaker 5>I can hear it now.</v>

3370
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:35.851
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>

3371
01:30:35.851 --> 01:30:40.500
<v Speaker 5>But the difference in that if you can't fight and one of the other,</v>

3372
01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:43.500
<v Speaker 5>if it is that dire to you as an athlete,</v>

3373
01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.490
<v Speaker 5>that you can only can,</v>

3374
01:30:44.610 --> 01:30:46.740
<v Speaker 5>you can only be successful in one arena.</v>

3375
01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.420
<v Speaker 5>You're just not that good.</v>

3376
01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:48.811
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3377
01:30:48.811 --> 01:30:49.800
<v Speaker 5>you're not that well rounded.</v>

3378
01:30:49.890 --> 01:30:50.730
<v Speaker 5>Well for sure.</v>

3379
01:30:50.731 --> 01:30:51.211
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

3380
01:30:51.211 --> 01:30:53.700
<v Speaker 5>anything you can do on one you can do in the other really well.</v>

3381
01:30:53.730 --> 01:30:56.910
<v Speaker 5>We did see big differences between of guys fighting in the cage and got us</v>

3382
01:30:56.911 --> 01:30:58.830
<v Speaker 5>fighting in the ring that had to do with it.</v>

3383
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:59.100
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3384
01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:01.930
<v Speaker 5>you don't think cro cop was talking about how big of a different it's,</v>

3385
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:04.590
<v Speaker 5>it was elbows on the ground was a big difference as well.</v>

3386
01:31:04.770 --> 01:31:06.000
<v Speaker 5>That definitely changes some things,</v>

3387
01:31:06.001 --> 01:31:06.301
<v Speaker 5>but no,</v>

3388
01:31:06.301 --> 01:31:07.134
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that was it.</v>

3389
01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.160
<v Speaker 5>So you think it's just the lack of preparation pop?</v>

3390
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:12.900
<v Speaker 5>I personally don't have a perfect answer for that,</v>

3391
01:31:12.901 --> 01:31:13.770
<v Speaker 5>but I don't believe it.</v>

3392
01:31:13.771 --> 01:31:14.604
<v Speaker 5>It was that,</v>

3393
01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:14.911
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3394
01:31:14.911 --> 01:31:16.740
<v Speaker 5>obviously he did much better after that.</v>

3395
01:31:16.770 --> 01:31:17.041
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3396
01:31:17.041 --> 01:31:20.160
<v Speaker 5>He got better at figuring out of the cage and the elbows on the ground and the</v>

3397
01:31:20.161 --> 01:31:20.701
<v Speaker 5>defense.</v>

3398
01:31:20.701 --> 01:31:21.060
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3399
01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:25.530
<v Speaker 5>So it's probably just a lack of the proper preparation that maybe this is only a</v>

3400
01:31:25.531 --> 01:31:26.341
<v Speaker 5>few places.</v>

3401
01:31:26.341 --> 01:31:27.060
<v Speaker 5>Like if you,</v>

3402
01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:29.760
<v Speaker 5>if you really looked at a young athletes today,</v>

3403
01:31:29.761 --> 01:31:30.990
<v Speaker 5>they want to compete in MMA.</v>

3404
01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:35.460
<v Speaker 5>Is there a dozen places in this country that you could go and get a proper</v>

3405
01:31:35.461 --> 01:31:38.950
<v Speaker 5>education as far as like being a real professional MMA fighters,</v>

3406
01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:39.803
<v Speaker 5>even a dozen.</v>

3407
01:31:39.810 --> 01:31:40.110
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3408
01:31:40.110 --> 01:31:40.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3409
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:45.330
<v Speaker 5>I can't say I've done all the research to say conclusively one way or the other.</v>

3410
01:31:45.331 --> 01:31:48.240
<v Speaker 5>I know that AMC CSW one of the best,</v>

3411
01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:49.103
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3412
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:50.340
<v Speaker 5>AMCs I mean,</v>

3413
01:31:50.341 --> 01:31:53.310
<v Speaker 5>Matt Hume is about as knowledgeable as anybody has ever lived well,</v>

3414
01:31:53.311 --> 01:31:54.570
<v Speaker 5>and looks at me and Matt human,</v>

3415
01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:58.710
<v Speaker 5>Eric Paulson or kind of cut from the same cloth and that their lineage comes</v>

3416
01:31:58.711 --> 01:31:59.890
<v Speaker 5>down from Karl Gotch,</v>

3417
01:31:59.950 --> 01:32:00.910
<v Speaker 5>from the shoot,</v>

3418
01:32:00.911 --> 01:32:04.780
<v Speaker 5>from a Siama and finicky and you know,</v>

3419
01:32:04.781 --> 01:32:05.770
<v Speaker 5>well rounded,</v>

3420
01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:07.600
<v Speaker 5>full meal deal dues.</v>

3421
01:32:07.601 --> 01:32:08.470
<v Speaker 5>They could do everything.</v>

3422
01:32:08.530 --> 01:32:09.010
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

3423
01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:09.371
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3424
01:32:09.371 --> 01:32:10.204
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3425
01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:11.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3426
01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.790
<v Speaker 5>so there's that.</v>

3427
01:32:12.791 --> 01:32:13.061
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

3428
01:32:13.061 --> 01:32:13.590
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3429
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.820
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3430
01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:14.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

3431
01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:14.681
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3432
01:32:14.681 --> 01:32:15.221
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3433
01:32:15.221 --> 01:32:15.491
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3434
01:32:15.491 --> 01:32:19.390
<v Speaker 5>I imagine Greg Jackson's could probably make you a con for us.</v>

3435
01:32:19.391 --> 01:32:20.020
<v Speaker 5>A hobby.</v>

3436
01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:20.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3437
01:32:20.650 --> 01:32:21.040
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>

3438
01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:21.341
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3439
01:32:21.341 --> 01:32:21.491
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3440
01:32:21.491 --> 01:32:22.810
<v Speaker 5>I've never trained her to these people.</v>

3441
01:32:22.811 --> 01:32:25.510
<v Speaker 5>I knew that I was very,</v>

3442
01:32:25.511 --> 01:32:30.511
<v Speaker 5>when I moved from when I moved from maths gym to go train somewhere else,</v>

3443
01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:34.420
<v Speaker 5>it was really hard for me to find,</v>

3444
01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:39.990
<v Speaker 5>there wasn't very many people back then and I felt like I could go there and</v>

3445
01:32:40.931 --> 01:32:44.980
<v Speaker 5>learn where I wouldn't be the one dictating all the training all the time.</v>

3446
01:32:45.970 --> 01:32:49.840
<v Speaker 5>I would be somewhere where I could learn and be trained.</v>

3447
01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:53.660
<v Speaker 1>What made you decide to go from Seattle and then live in southern California?</v>

3448
01:32:53.661 --> 01:32:55.220
<v Speaker 1>How come you don't stay up there and train with Matt?</v>

3449
01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:56.203
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3450
01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:59.060
<v Speaker 5>at the time it just wasn't really feasible.</v>

3451
01:32:59.061 --> 01:33:03.230
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have the sparring partners and Matt wasn't really around that much,</v>

3452
01:33:03.231 --> 01:33:06.590
<v Speaker 5>so I was ending up having to do a lot of my own training because he was going to</v>

3453
01:33:06.591 --> 01:33:07.700
<v Speaker 5>pride to judge.</v>

3454
01:33:07.701 --> 01:33:09.590
<v Speaker 5>He had a lot of stuff on his plate.</v>

3455
01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:10.011
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3456
01:33:10.011 --> 01:33:10.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3457
01:33:10.650 --> 01:33:11.030
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3458
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:12.140
<v Speaker 5>and especially like I said,</v>

3459
01:33:12.141 --> 01:33:13.700
<v Speaker 5>I had no sparring partners.</v>

3460
01:33:13.701 --> 01:33:14.534
<v Speaker 5>I had nothing.</v>

3461
01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:15.171
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3462
01:33:15.171 --> 01:33:15.711
<v Speaker 5>I was re,</v>

3463
01:33:15.711 --> 01:33:19.820
<v Speaker 5>sandy was my main dude and we would do a lot of training together every night,</v>

3464
01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:21.410
<v Speaker 5>somewhat Jeff months in.</v>

3465
01:33:21.411 --> 01:33:25.310
<v Speaker 5>But a lot of time I ended up teaching Jeff and even teaching Reese and they were</v>

3466
01:33:25.311 --> 01:33:26.900
<v Speaker 5>great guys and I learned a lot from,</v>

3467
01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:27.770
<v Speaker 5>they were very,</v>

3468
01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:28.011
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

3469
01:33:28.011 --> 01:33:28.844
<v Speaker 5>very helpful,</v>

3470
01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:33.710
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't have sparring partners and then I just thought,</v>

3471
01:33:33.711 --> 01:33:34.340
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3472
01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:35.330
<v Speaker 5>this isn't the place to be.</v>

3473
01:33:35.331 --> 01:33:40.331
<v Speaker 5>Seattle is my barn on favorite place in the U S and one of my favorite place in</v>

3474
01:33:40.741 --> 01:33:41.191
<v Speaker 5>the whole world,</v>

3475
01:33:41.191 --> 01:33:42.290
<v Speaker 5>and then she was an amazing city.</v>

3476
01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:43.153
<v Speaker 5>Do you like clouds?</v>

3477
01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:44.150
<v Speaker 5>I like clouds.</v>

3478
01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:44.841
<v Speaker 5>I like Flan.</v>

3479
01:33:44.841 --> 01:33:45.440
<v Speaker 5>Russian.</v>

3480
01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:48.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm into suppression and heroin altogether.</v>

3481
01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Coffee?</v>

3482
01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3483
01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.640

3489
01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have Megan?</v>

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Seattle's think he puts his stories are what?</v>

3491
01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:57.091

<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

3493
01:33:57.930 --> 01:33:58.890
<v Speaker 1>They just never clean it.</v>

3494
01:33:58.891 --> 01:34:00.390
<v Speaker 1>They're just all in bed sleeping,</v>

3495
01:34:00.391 --> 01:34:01.290
<v Speaker 1>crying and shit.</v>

3496
01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:02.790
<v Speaker 1>That's not true at all.</v>

3497
01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:03.930
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

3498
01:34:04.110 --> 01:34:04.501
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3499
01:34:04.501 --> 01:34:06.270
<v Speaker 1>they don't clean your pussy.</v>

01:34:16.531 --> 01:34:16.980
<v Speaker 1>They're good.</v>

3505
01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:20.340
<v Speaker 1>It's actually important for women and not do that like douchey and stuff that's</v>

3508
01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:25.560
<v Speaker 1>they had to do it.</v>

3509
01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:26.790
<v Speaker 1>My mom did it all the time.</v>

3510

<v Speaker 5>like say if you're working out with a bunch of like really good middleweights</v>

3579
01:36:05.150 --> 01:36:05.931
<v Speaker 5>sounded good enough,</v>

3580
01:36:05.931 --> 01:36:06.440
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3581
01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.273
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3582
01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:09.310
<v Speaker 5>depends on what I'm trying to work on.</v>

3583
01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:10.550
<v Speaker 5>If I'm just going against the guide,</v>

3584
01:36:10.551 --> 01:36:13.550
<v Speaker 5>it's just working on passing somebody's guard or something like that.</v>

3585
01:36:13.551 --> 01:36:13.731
<v Speaker 5>Sure,</v>

3586
01:36:13.731 --> 01:36:14.300
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>

3587
01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:16.010
<v Speaker 5>And we're just catching a leg fine.</v>

3588
01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:18.680
<v Speaker 5>But if I need to have someone to push me,</v>

3589
01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:21.380
<v Speaker 5>I need someone to be able to match me with strength,</v>

3590
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:22.500
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3591
01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:23.120
<v Speaker 5>weight,</v>

3592
01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:24.020
<v Speaker 5>all that kind of stuff.</v>

3593
01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:29.840
<v Speaker 5>And then Eric was down here also everything else that you could jump off from</v>

3594
01:36:29.841 --> 01:36:31.160
<v Speaker 5>fighting as an entertainment,</v>

3595
01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:32.473
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3596
01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:36.700
<v Speaker 5>a commodity and to anything else acting this way,</v>

3597
01:36:36.710 --> 01:36:37.401
<v Speaker 5>you keep bringing that up.</v>

3598
01:36:37.401 --> 01:36:40.990
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you're trying to do now is I have a smart dude like you,</v>

3599
01:36:40.991 --> 01:36:42.830
<v Speaker 5>you think about your athletic career,</v>

3600
01:36:42.831 --> 01:36:43.221
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3601
01:36:43.221 --> 01:36:44.270
<v Speaker 5>you can't do this forever.</v>

3602
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:49.040
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's athletic window is a very small portion of their life.</v>

3603
01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:49.963
<v Speaker 5>It's important,</v>

3604
01:36:50.210 --> 01:36:53.000
<v Speaker 5>but you need to not just be the best athlete.</v>

3605
01:36:53.001 --> 01:36:55.550
<v Speaker 5>You need to grow as a person and you need to be able to,</v>

3606
01:36:55.551 --> 01:36:57.380
<v Speaker 5>it's not about setting up plan B,</v>

3607
01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:01.130
<v Speaker 5>it's about evolving as a person.</v>

3608
01:37:01.131 --> 01:37:05.450
<v Speaker 5>That's about opening new doors and doing new things and growing and having new</v>

3609
01:37:05.451 --> 01:37:06.141
<v Speaker 5>opportunities.</v>

3610
01:37:06.141 --> 01:37:07.790
<v Speaker 5>And so I've been acting,</v>

3611
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.691
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3612
01:37:08.691 --> 01:37:09.710
<v Speaker 5>I've done commentary.</v>

3613
01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:13.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing commentary on new Japan pro wrestling on access right now.</v>

3614
01:37:13.190 --> 01:37:15.200
<v Speaker 5>And that's not new to me.</v>

3615
01:37:15.201 --> 01:37:15.771
<v Speaker 5>I've done,</v>

3616
01:37:15.771 --> 01:37:17.390
<v Speaker 5>I've never done progressing commentary,</v>

3617
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:19.260
<v Speaker 5>but I've done tons of fight commentary.</v>

3618
01:37:19.261 --> 01:37:23.450
<v Speaker 5>I did commentary for pride or did commentary for some other events from</v>

3619
01:37:23.451 --> 01:37:24.284
<v Speaker 5>pancreas.</v>

3620
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:25.243
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

3621
01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:26.661
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

3622
01:37:26.661 --> 01:37:27.080
<v Speaker 5>cool,</v>

3623
01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:28.310
<v Speaker 5>I can do this and that's no problem.</v>

3624
01:37:28.311 --> 01:37:30.440
<v Speaker 5>Even though he kept hitting me up.</v>

3625
01:37:30.441 --> 01:37:30.521
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3626
01:37:30.521 --> 01:37:31.640
<v Speaker 5>why don't you do UFC events?</v>

3627
01:37:31.641 --> 01:37:32.330
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you do this one?</v>

3628
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:32.580
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

3629
01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:33.290
<v Speaker 5>well no one,</v>

3630
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:34.011
<v Speaker 5>they're not hiring me.</v>

3631
01:37:34.011 --> 01:37:36.860
<v Speaker 5>So that's why I'm not doing commentary there.</v>

3632
01:37:36.861 --> 01:37:39.380
<v Speaker 5>And then I got the Steven Seagal movie coming out,</v>

3633
01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:40.070
<v Speaker 5>absolution.</v>

3634
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:43.100
<v Speaker 5>It should be out relatively soon to spar with Steven Seagal.</v>

3635
01:37:43.101 --> 01:37:44.410
<v Speaker 5>And I did not have to sparse teams.</v>

3636
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:46.520
<v Speaker 5>A goal on my balls are perfectly intact.</v>

3637
01:37:47.810 --> 01:37:49.670
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have any fight scenes with him.</v>

3638
01:37:49.671 --> 01:37:52.730
<v Speaker 5>I just scenes with him acting scenes and not really,</v>

3639
01:37:53.250 --> 01:37:53.670
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3640
01:37:53.670 --> 01:37:53.970
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

3641
01:37:53.970 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 5>he was in a scene where I'm in the background.</v>

3642
01:37:56.071 --> 01:37:57.420
<v Speaker 5>I just end up getting into a fight with him,</v>

3643
01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.070
<v Speaker 5>with his sidekick guy.</v>

3644
01:37:59.071 --> 01:37:59.640
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>

3645
01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:01.440
<v Speaker 5>so I give that dude his hero moment,</v>

3646
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:03.720
<v Speaker 5>a by run man who did a great job.</v>

3647
01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:04.890
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3648
01:38:04.890 --> 01:38:08.010
<v Speaker 5>and I've got another movie that should be coming out sometime this year called</v>

3649
01:38:08.011 --> 01:38:09.480
<v Speaker 5>chuck Hank and the San Diego twins.</v>

3650
01:38:09.481 --> 01:38:10.291
<v Speaker 5>It's an indie film.</v>

3651
01:38:10.291 --> 01:38:12.600
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking completely insane.</v>

3652
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:17.010
<v Speaker 5>So how do you balance that between training or you like leaning more towards</v>

3653
01:38:17.011 --> 01:38:17.700
<v Speaker 5>that area now?</v>

3654
01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:19.450
<v Speaker 5>You haven't fought since the Travis Brown fight,</v>

3655
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:20.303
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3656
01:38:21.330 --> 01:38:22.163
<v Speaker 5>Last year,</v>

3657
01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:24.330
<v Speaker 5>2014 December.</v>

3658
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:25.270
<v Speaker 5>Do you have anything on your,</v>

3659
01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:26.760
<v Speaker 5>on your plate right now?</v>

3660
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:31.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm hoping I at some point to get a word on whether or not I'm fighting Roy</v>

3661
01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:32.850
<v Speaker 5>Nelson because we,</v>

3662
01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:33.811
<v Speaker 5>it was brought up,</v>

3663
01:38:33.811 --> 01:38:35.160
<v Speaker 5>someone brought up the idea of,</v>

3664
01:38:35.190 --> 01:38:35.400
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3665
01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:36.900
<v Speaker 5>Roy and me doing metamorris.</v>

3666
01:38:36.930 --> 01:38:37.081
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3667
01:38:37.081 --> 01:38:38.010
<v Speaker 5>that's what I've kind of had to,</v>

3668
01:38:38.011 --> 01:38:38.400
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

3669
01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:38.510
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3670
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:39.031
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3671
01:38:39.031 --> 01:38:39.451
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3672
01:38:39.451 --> 01:38:41.160
<v Speaker 5>And then Roy said,</v>

3673
01:38:41.190 --> 01:38:41.700
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

3674
01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:42.540
<v Speaker 5>that sounds cool,</v>

3675
01:38:42.541 --> 01:38:43.620
<v Speaker 5>but we fight first,</v>

3676
01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:44.813
<v Speaker 5>pays better.</v>

3677
01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:45.300
<v Speaker 5>And how I had,</v>

3678
01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:46.020
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3679
01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:46.651
<v Speaker 5>if you're willing,</v>

3680
01:38:46.651 --> 01:38:47.484
<v Speaker 5>I'm willing.</v>

3681
01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:48.240
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>

3682
01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:48.511
<v Speaker 5>good,</v>

3683
01:38:48.511 --> 01:38:49.440
<v Speaker 5>let's make it happen.</v>

3684
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.771
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

3685
01:38:49.771 --> 01:38:50.310
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3686
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:51.180
<v Speaker 5>I guess that's that.</v>

3687
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:52.110
<v Speaker 5>If we say we're going to,</v>

3688
01:38:52.111 --> 01:38:54.090
<v Speaker 5>we're willing to fight and we're ready to step up and go,</v>

3689
01:38:54.091 --> 01:38:55.350
<v Speaker 5>then you know what's legit.</v>

3690
01:38:55.590 --> 01:38:59.050
<v Speaker 5>And have there been any conversations with Joe Silva or the highly,</v>

3691
01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:01.050
<v Speaker 5>I imagine my manager's the one with all of that,</v>

3692
01:39:01.051 --> 01:39:01.710
<v Speaker 5>but I'll show you.</v>

3693
01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:05.910
<v Speaker 5>You have your manager was informed of all this stuff and hey,</v>

3694
01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:06.983
<v Speaker 5>go deal with that.</v>

3695
01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:07.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3696
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:09.060
<v Speaker 5>but I gotta Act pretty much.</v>

3697
01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:09.530
<v Speaker 5>I got,</v>

3698
01:39:09.530 --> 01:39:10.710
<v Speaker 5>I gotta hit acting class.</v>

3699
01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:15.300
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't be opposed to doing a metamorris with him though?</v>

3700
01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:15.811
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3701
01:39:15.811 --> 01:39:17.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm not opposed to doing a metamorris with anybody.</v>

3702
01:39:17.821 --> 01:39:18.654
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

3703
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:23.670
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I'll ever get a chance to finish the rubber match with Nogueira.</v>

3704
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:24.781
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3705
01:39:24.781 --> 01:39:27.630
<v Speaker 5>but I could at least probably get him on the mat and Metamorris.</v>

3706
01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:28.793
<v Speaker 5>Do you think so?</v>

3707
01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:29.551
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

3708
01:39:29.551 --> 01:39:29.821
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3709
01:39:29.821 --> 01:39:32.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't see why he wouldn't want to do it and why people wouldn't want to see</v>

3710
01:39:32.701 --> 01:39:33.330
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3711
01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:35.660
<v Speaker 5>But I've already got a brain.</v>

3712
01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:37.920
<v Speaker 5>You cyborg coming up.</v>

3713
01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:38.610
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3714
01:39:38.610 --> 01:39:39.360
<v Speaker 5>May 9th.</v>

3715
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:40.920
<v Speaker 5>That's a more interesting,</v>

3716
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:41.970
<v Speaker 5>that's very interesting.</v>

3717
01:39:41.971 --> 01:39:43.890
<v Speaker 5>Especially after you just submit a dean lister.</v>

3718
01:39:44.210 --> 01:39:45.390
<v Speaker 5>That's very huge dude.</v>

3719
01:39:45.391 --> 01:39:48.240
<v Speaker 5>Submitting Dean lister is a gigantic accomplishment.</v>

3738
01:40:27.610 --> 01:40:27.900
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3739
01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:28.950

01:40:30.721 --> 01:40:33.750
<v Speaker 5>and and also to Eric cause that's from his roots and Matt Hume.</v>

3743
01:40:33.751 --> 01:40:34.560
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

3744
01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:35.311
<v Speaker 5>from my training,</v>

3745
01:40:35.311 --> 01:40:35.860
<v Speaker 5>my roots,</v>

3746
01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:36.361
<v Speaker 5>my heritage,</v>

3747
01:40:36.361 --> 01:40:41.361
<v Speaker 5>my catch wrestling training and to Antonio and Oakey who was one of my trainers</v>

3748
01:40:41.851 --> 01:40:43.020
<v Speaker 5>for professional wrestling.</v>

3749
01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:46.170
<v Speaker 5>So I had the towel around my neck,</v>

3750
01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:46.890
<v Speaker 5>the robe,</v>

3751
01:40:46.890 --> 01:40:49.400
<v Speaker 5>even the way I took the robe off and there was all,</v>

3752
01:40:49.401 --> 01:40:49.831
<v Speaker 5>all of that.</v>

3753
01:40:49.831 --> 01:40:50.581
<v Speaker 5>The black boots,</v>

3754
01:40:50.581 --> 01:40:51.600
<v Speaker 5>it's all black.</v>

3755
01:40:51.601 --> 01:40:53.620
<v Speaker 5>It's all in Oman.</v>

3756
01:40:53.650 --> 01:40:54.370
<v Speaker 5>And respect</v>

3757
01:40:54.370 --> 01:40:55.203
<v Speaker 3>to my,</v>

3758
01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:56.890
<v Speaker 3>my catch wrestling roots and my trainers.</v>

3759
01:40:56.910 --> 01:40:57.370
<v Speaker 3>Well it's,</v>

3760
01:40:57.370 --> 01:41:01.480
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important to highlight those roots to for the just the lineage of</v>

3761
01:41:01.481 --> 01:41:06.481
<v Speaker 3>MMA because a lot of folks that are on the outside are not aware that there were</v>

3762
01:41:07.001 --> 01:41:09.970
<v Speaker 3>several different branches of submission fighting,</v>

3763
01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:10.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3764
01:41:10.541 --> 01:41:11.650
<v Speaker 3>not just judo,</v>

3765
01:41:11.651 --> 01:41:13.110
<v Speaker 3>not just Jujitsu notches.</v>

3766
01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Sambo catch wrestling had some really legit submissions that are still used</v>

3767
01:41:19.001 --> 01:41:24.001
<v Speaker 3>today and a lot of really great grapplers but catch wrestling eventually sort of</v>

3768
01:41:25.091 --> 01:41:29.830
<v Speaker 3>morphed into professional wrestling and a lot of folks are not aware of the</v>

3769
01:41:29.831 --> 01:41:31.720
<v Speaker 3>original aspect of catch wrestling,</v>

3770
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:36.100
<v Speaker 3>which we're talking about these three hour matches and guys that would go to,</v>

3771
01:41:36.130 --> 01:41:40.660
<v Speaker 3>they would do carnival matches where they would go roll into town and wrestling.</v>

3772
01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:42.850
<v Speaker 2>You who owned a big old carnival in Brazil,</v>

3773
01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:43.720
<v Speaker 2>who?</v>

3774
01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:45.730
<v Speaker 2>The head of the Gracie family at the time.</v>

3775
01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:47.013
<v Speaker 2>Good style.</v>

3776
01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

3777
01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:51.870
<v Speaker 2>He owned a carnival and he had professional wrestling catch wrestling matches at</v>

3778
01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:56.880
<v Speaker 2>his carnival who should happen to come and perform in one of these catch</v>

3779
01:41:57.041 --> 01:41:57.880
<v Speaker 2>wrestling matches.</v>

3780
01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:01.220
<v Speaker 2>But the account coma Mitsui [inaudible],</v>

3781
01:42:02.110 --> 01:42:03.250
<v Speaker 2>he stayed in Brazil.</v>

3782
01:42:03.670 --> 01:42:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Carlos Gracie started training under him in judo and catch,</v>

3783
01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:09.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3784
01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:13.480
<v Speaker 2>is where now all of a sudden you have Gracie Jujitsu.</v>

3785
01:42:13.930 --> 01:42:17.050
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of branched off from a bunch of different sources,</v>

3786
01:42:17.051 --> 01:42:20.090
<v Speaker 2>not just from judo but don't catch wrestling as well because my,</v>

3787
01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:23.110
<v Speaker 2>I had been traveling the world competing and catch matches and all that.</v>

3788
01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Kimora competed in catch matches as well.</v>

3789
01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.680
<v Speaker 2>So even though the Americana arm lock came from American wrestlers catch,</v>

3790
01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:37.060
<v Speaker 2>they allude to leave ray background comes from catch a tattoo,</v>

3791
01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:37.871
<v Speaker 2>a Ukulele,</v>

3792
01:42:37.871 --> 01:42:39.000
<v Speaker 2>these hot them,</v>

3793
01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:40.840
<v Speaker 2>he was a catch wrestler.</v>

3794
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:42.850
<v Speaker 2>He was trained to do show matches,</v>

3795
01:42:42.851 --> 01:42:44.380
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time he trained,</v>

3796
01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:45.310
<v Speaker 2>even back then,</v>

3797
01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:46.990
<v Speaker 2>even if you did works,</v>

3798
01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:48.370
<v Speaker 2>you trained as a shooter,</v>

3799
01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:49.810
<v Speaker 2>you trained to do that shit for real.</v>

3800
01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Look at this beautiful outfit and a mother Fucker,</v>

3801
01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:53.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3802
01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:54.071
<v Speaker 2>comes out,</v>

3803
01:42:54.071 --> 01:42:54.210
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3804
01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:55.390
<v Speaker 3>The robe on.</v>

3805
01:42:55.940 --> 01:42:57.850
<v Speaker 3>This is so old school view,</v>

3806
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:59.660
<v Speaker 3>look at this to do this.</v>

3807
01:42:59.661 --> 01:43:04.040
<v Speaker 3>And metamorris he almost had to feel like you're kind of wearing like a costume.</v>

3808
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3809
01:43:05.241 --> 01:43:07.220
<v Speaker 3>I knew that people would be unfamiliar.</v>

3810
01:43:07.221 --> 01:43:08.360
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't understand it,</v>

3811
01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:10.250
<v Speaker 3>but people did understand it though.</v>

3812
01:43:10.251 --> 01:43:11.360
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people in the underground,</v>

3813

3817
01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:17.180
<v Speaker 2>in reference to all my time spent in Japan.</v>

3818
01:43:17.181 --> 01:43:18.500

3834
01:43:33.351 --> 01:43:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Or as a leg lock specialist,</v>

3862
01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:13.850
<v Speaker 1>I had to go catch fingers and roll my grip into it to actually get all the way</v>

3863
01:44:13.851 --> 01:44:14.380
<v Speaker 1>around us.</v>

3864
01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:15.830
<v Speaker 1>It was so fucking thick.</v>

3865
01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:18.380
<v Speaker 1>He's a big fucker thick and veiny purple.</v>

3866
01:44:18.690 --> 01:44:19.523
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3867
01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:20.503
<v Speaker 1>Slow down.</v>

3868
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:22.790
<v Speaker 1>You want to help me on my throbbing ground game?</v>

3869
01:44:22.791 --> 01:44:23.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3870
01:44:23.121 --> 01:44:23.630
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

3871
01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:24.290
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

3872
01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:25.610
<v Speaker 1>That what they bought it these days.</v>

3873
01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3874
01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:29.780
<v Speaker 1>D was a big massive guy when he fought Babaloo.</v>

3875
01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:34.530
<v Speaker 1>I was really shocked that he was like allowing almost Bob Ballou to lock up</v>

3876
01:44:34.670 --> 01:44:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Darcy's on them like,</v>

3877
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:38.910
<v Speaker 1>like Baba lose a really good submission guy.</v>

3878
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:43.130
<v Speaker 1>He is excellent and he's just so smiley at getting out all that stuff.</v>

3879
01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:44.300
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked.</v>

3880
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked that he was allowing that,</v>

3881
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:50.240
<v Speaker 1>but it also looked like he didn't have the gas to go a full 20 like,</v>

3882
01:44:50.241 --> 01:44:50.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3883
01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Bob a loo at the end of the match was in way better shape and dean was,</v>

3884
01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:54.741
<v Speaker 1>I agreed.</v>

3885
01:44:54.741 --> 01:44:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Herring around all that muscle,</v>

3886
01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:57.330
<v Speaker 1>all that mass that he carry.</v>

3887
01:44:57.331 --> 01:44:57.431
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3888
01:44:57.431 --> 01:44:58.670
<v Speaker 1>you're a bigger guy.</v>

3889
01:44:58.810 --> 01:45:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Like he might be two 40 but a lot of that is Mexican supplements.</v>

3890
01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:06.580
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference between your two 40 and his two fort.</v>

3891
01:45:06.730 --> 01:45:07.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying like,</v>

3892
01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:07.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3893
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think avocado,</v>

3894
01:45:09.130 --> 01:45:10.250
<v Speaker 1>a hot sauce,</v>

3895
01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.740
<v Speaker 1>you know that stuff has done wonders.</v>

3896
01:45:12.741 --> 01:45:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

3897
01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of different supplements,</v>

3898
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:15.703
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>

3899
01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:19.940
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the green sauce,</v>

3900
01:45:19.941 --> 01:45:22.190
<v Speaker 1>he's so skilled and talented too.</v>

3901
01:45:22.191 --> 01:45:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not just all the extra muscle.</v>

3902
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:27.860
<v Speaker 1>He was strong as shit when I wrestled him and apparently his guys and him,</v>

3903
01:45:28.250 --> 01:45:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Dean said he wrestled a lot of big dudes.</v>

3904
01:45:30.650 --> 01:45:35.030
<v Speaker 1>They wrestled against guys for pressure from top and it's just that I was able</v>

3905
01:45:35.031 --> 01:45:36.650
<v Speaker 1>to apply it that much better.</v>

3906
01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Did you think that you are going to be able to catch him with that choke?</v>

3907
01:45:38.871 --> 01:45:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Was that something specifically that you had saw before?</v>

3908
01:45:40.881 --> 01:45:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Did you game plan?</v>

3909
01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:41.901

3959
01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:02.160
<v Speaker 1>You put it on the door like a bathroom door.</v>

3960
01:47:02.161 --> 01:47:03.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like at this bolt screws and place,</v>

3961
01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:06.450
<v Speaker 1>it has like an arm and then you ratchet it,</v>

3969
01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:15.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that the same.</v>

3970
01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I think what he did was different.</v>

3971
01:47:16.981 --> 01:47:18.850
<v Speaker 1>How does that not just rip your door off the hill?</v>

3972

<v Speaker 1>It's a very different animal.</v>

4044
01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:44.240
<v Speaker 1>It will get you all kinds of heat can get upset if training underwear.</v>

01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:08.000
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about a tie steel cups for grappling competition.</v>

4059
01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:12.150
<v Speaker 1>So they're getting outlawed and a lot of grappling competitions because they</v>

4060
01:49:12.151 --> 01:49:13.560
<v Speaker 1>provide that extra leverage.</v>

4061
01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:15.300
<v Speaker 1>They're like a fulcrum point,</v>

4062
01:49:15.330 --> 01:49:16.380
<v Speaker 1>like a leverage point.</v>

01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:41.200
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a doctor.</v>

4212
01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:43.510
<v Speaker 1>How fucking stupid can you be when you,</v>

4213
01:52:43.511 --> 01:52:44.470
<v Speaker 1>you go to school,</v>

4214
01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:45.380
<v Speaker 1>you're a doctor,</v>

4215
01:52:45.381 --> 01:52:46.250
<v Speaker 1>you get a degree</v>

4216
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:49.790
<v Speaker 3>and then you're smart enough where you get hired by Monsanto.</v>

4217
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:53.660
<v Speaker 3>You're smart enough where you do interviews and you expect it to be an expert</v>

4218
01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:55.100
<v Speaker 3>but you're so fucking stupid.</v>

4219
01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:56.360
<v Speaker 3>You say something like,</v>

4220
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:57.320
<v Speaker 3>oh you could drink it.</v>

4221
01:52:57.321 --> 01:52:58.154
<v Speaker 3>I would drink it.</v>

4222
01:52:58.360 --> 01:52:59.181
<v Speaker 3>He would drink it.</v>

4223
01:52:59.181 --> 01:53:02.300
<v Speaker 3>We have something stupid or do you think he's just being a piece of shit and</v>

4224
01:53:02.301 --> 01:53:04.070
<v Speaker 3>trying to lie for Monsanto?</v>

4225
01:53:04.100 --> 01:53:04.910
<v Speaker 3>I think both.</v>

4226
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:08.550
<v Speaker 3>Did they go into it and go like we broke down the chemicals in this [inaudible]</v>

4227
01:53:08.570 --> 01:53:09.740
<v Speaker 3>actually be safe.</v>

4228
01:53:09.741 --> 01:53:11.900
<v Speaker 3>Like did they expand that at all?</v>

4229
01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:15.950
<v Speaker 3>Because a lot of those things like the real issue is prolonged exposure.</v>

4230
01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Like I know a dude who has bone cancer and he got bone cancer because his family</v>

4231
01:53:20.601 --> 01:53:24.980
<v Speaker 3>lived near a golf course and the golf course used a lot of pesticides and</v>

4232
01:53:24.981 --> 01:53:28.460
<v Speaker 3>infected the well water and all the kids in the neighborhood guide cancer too.</v>

4233
01:53:28.650 --> 01:53:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Like his next door neighbor got cancer,</v>

4234
01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:32.300
<v Speaker 3>has the duty lived across the street,</v>

4235
01:53:32.301 --> 01:53:32.970
<v Speaker 3>got cancer.</v>

4236
01:53:32.970 --> 01:53:35.090
<v Speaker 3>So important to keep that grass nice and lush.</v>

4237
01:53:35.091 --> 01:53:35.271
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4238
01:53:35.271 --> 01:53:36.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they knew.</v>

4239
01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:37.930
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of carcinogen.</v>

4240
01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:42.020
<v Speaker 5>I'll give him that and that back in the day they didn't understand how</v>

4241
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:43.850
<v Speaker 5>potentially hazardous uh,</v>

4242
01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:47.300
<v Speaker 5>longterm effects versus short term could be.</v>

4243
01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:51.050
<v Speaker 5>Even though they didn't really know how bad cigarettes were entirely at a point.</v>

4244
01:53:51.051 --> 01:53:52.760
<v Speaker 5>But then it came a point that they did know,</v>

4245
01:53:53.690 --> 01:53:55.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean cigarettes still blow me away.</v>

4246
01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:55.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4247
01:53:55.730 --> 01:53:57.970
<v Speaker 5>Why do you add the shit in all the poisons and stuff?</v>

4248
01:53:58.010 --> 01:53:58.521
<v Speaker 5>It's okay.</v>

4249
01:53:58.521 --> 01:53:58.671

01:53:58.911 --> 01:54:00.380
<v Speaker 5>you're inhaling smoke,</v>

4252
01:54:00.381 --> 01:54:00.681
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

4253
01:54:00.681 --> 01:54:01.514
<v Speaker 5>we all know is bad.</v>

4254
01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:02.930
<v Speaker 5>You can die from smoke inhalation.</v>

4255
01:54:02.931 --> 01:54:04.280
<v Speaker 5>It's carcinogens or in their car.</v>

4256
01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:04.940
<v Speaker 5>Fine,</v>

4257
01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:05.773
<v Speaker 5>we got it.</v>

4258
01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:08.630
<v Speaker 5>Do you have to add all the other crap that's in it?</v>

4259
01:54:08.710 --> 01:54:11.120
<v Speaker 5>They had all of our Schick and all this garbage.</v>

4262
01:54:16.971 --> 01:54:17.421
<v Speaker 5>tobacco.</v>

4263
01:54:17.421 --> 01:54:18.260
<v Speaker 5>Just let him smoke it.</v>

4264
01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:19.730
<v Speaker 5>Let them know what's going to happen.</v>

4265
01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:21.260
<v Speaker 5>But you don't have to help them.</v>

4266
01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:23.030
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to fuck and add rat poison,</v>

4267
01:54:23.370 --> 01:54:26.760
<v Speaker 3>try American spirits and compare it to like a Marlboro light.</v>

01:55:45.150 --> 01:55:46.320
<v Speaker 1>This time and time again,</v>

4323
01:55:46.321 --> 01:55:49.950
<v Speaker 1>experts had been co opted by money but when you see it so clear that like this</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking guy,</v>

4334
01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:05.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know but I'm not going to drink a quarter of it.</v>

4335
01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:07.193
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

4336
01:56:07.290 --> 01:56:08.010
<v Speaker 1>If he did,</v>

4337
01:56:08.010 --> 01:56:09.210
<v Speaker 1>you would want to throw up.</v>

4338
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:10.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you would.</v>

4339
01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean court of,</v>

4340
01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:13.320
<v Speaker 1>first of all it's a powder.</v>

4341
01:56:13.321 --> 01:56:14.370
<v Speaker 1>You can really drove it quicker.</v>

4342
01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:15.180
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

4343
01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:18.390
<v Speaker 1>you could pour a quart you to amend the metal amount of liquid,</v>

4344
01:56:18.391 --> 01:56:22.920
<v Speaker 1>you would have to have to drink a quart of Splenda or how about just a court of</v>

4345
01:56:23.250 --> 01:56:28.250
<v Speaker 1>a quart of water with a appropriately dissolved solid of Splenda within it?</v>

4346
01:56:30.090 --> 01:56:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it w</v>

4347
01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:34.453
<v Speaker 1>it would only help him.</v>

4348
01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4349
01:56:34.730 --> 01:56:35.300
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

4350
01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

4351
01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:36.490
<v Speaker 1>This is what it all,</v>

4352
01:56:36.490 --> 01:56:37.201
<v Speaker 1>because look,</v>

4353
01:56:37.201 --> 01:56:41.160
<v Speaker 1>if you've survived all the horrible encounters you've had in your life up to</v>

4354
01:56:41.161 --> 01:56:41.611
<v Speaker 1>this point,</v>

4355
01:56:41.611 --> 01:56:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

4356
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.950
<v Speaker 1>that what's that going to do?</v>

4357
01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4358
01:56:44.610 --> 01:56:45.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4359
01:56:45.031 --> 01:56:46.200
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably get a helpless,</v>

4360
01:56:46.201 --> 01:56:46.441
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4361
01:56:46.441 --> 01:56:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Dead in the eyes and kill,</v>

4362
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:48.263
<v Speaker 1>kill the aids.</v>

4363
01:56:48.420 --> 01:56:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Fuck off.</v>

4364
01:56:48.990 --> 01:56:49.823
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4365
01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:50.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4366
01:56:50.341 --> 01:56:51.960
<v Speaker 1>It's going to kill the aids inside of her body.</v>

4367
01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:53.520
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking,</v>

4368
01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't deal with this.</v>

4369
01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:55.620
<v Speaker 1>This is one,</v>

4370
01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:56.880
<v Speaker 1>one level too far.</v>

4371
01:56:57.090 --> 01:56:57.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4372
01:56:57.511 --> 01:57:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there's gonna come a time in our future where these kind of guys,</v>

4373
01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:02.350
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

4374
01:57:02.350 --> 01:57:05.970
<v Speaker 1>these guys were obviously bought and paid just don't exist anymore.</v>

4375
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:06.990
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that though?</v>

4376
01:57:06.991 --> 01:57:09.840
<v Speaker 1>You have to make people accountable and we don't want to seem to do that.</v>

4377
01:57:09.841 --> 01:57:13.440
<v Speaker 1>And then the people you would expect would make them accountable.</v>

4378
01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4379
01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:14.090
<v Speaker 1>These are the,</v>

4380
01:57:14.090 --> 01:57:16.770
<v Speaker 1>these checks and balances that get put together too.</v>

4381
01:57:16.771 --> 01:57:16.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4382
01:57:16.951 --> 01:57:18.540
<v Speaker 1>this is to police that and this is,</v>

4383
01:57:18.690 --> 01:57:19.890
<v Speaker 1>they are all fucked up,</v>

4384
01:57:19.891 --> 01:57:20.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4385
01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:21.053
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4386
01:57:21.630 --> 01:57:24.990
<v Speaker 1>how do you let the banks just rob you blind?</v>

4387
01:57:24.991 --> 01:57:25.201
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4388
01:57:25.201 --> 01:57:28.740
<v Speaker 1>there's that whole library scandal where they're just fudge and fixing numbers</v>

4389
01:57:28.741 --> 01:57:29.240
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4390
01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:30.480
<v Speaker 1>and they go to chase and they go,</v>

4391
01:57:30.481 --> 01:57:30.691
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4392
01:57:30.691 --> 01:57:31.524
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna,</v>

4393
01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:33.150
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna find you.</v>

4394
01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:38.520
<v Speaker 1>12 billion chased makes 45 billion a year.</v>

4395
01:57:38.521 --> 01:57:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't fucking matter.</v>

4396
01:57:40.110 --> 01:57:43.830
<v Speaker 1>You know what they did in Vietnam was they went and they grabbed all the people</v>

4397
01:57:43.831 --> 01:57:45.690
<v Speaker 1>that all the bankers and all that,</v>

4398
01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:50.760
<v Speaker 1>all the officials that fucked everybody over with in terms of the banking system</v>

4399
01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:53.400
<v Speaker 1>and they stuck him life in prison and killed them.</v>

4400
01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Now you have one extreme to the other.</v>

4401
01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:58.800
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>

4402
01:57:59.130 --> 01:57:59.963
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4403
01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:01.133
<v Speaker 1>what does,</v>

4404
01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:01.973
<v Speaker 1>what does worse?</v>

4405
01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:02.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4406
01:58:02.341 --> 01:58:02.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4407
01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:02.911
<v Speaker 1>they're mean.</v>

4408
01:58:02.911 --> 01:58:06.720
<v Speaker 1>There's been many bankers that have been caught that are doing things like</v>

4409
01:58:06.721 --> 01:58:09.420
<v Speaker 1>they're laundering money for drug cartels.</v>

4410
01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:10.910
<v Speaker 1>And that was one of the big ones.</v>

4411
01:58:10.911 --> 01:58:15.540
<v Speaker 1>It was recently exposed that these guys were laundering money for Mexican drug</v>

4412
01:58:15.541 --> 01:58:17.700
<v Speaker 1>cartels and they just got a big fat fine.</v>

4413
01:58:18.330 --> 01:58:18.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4414
01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:19.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean we,</v>

4415
01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:19.770
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile,</v>

4416
01:58:19.770 --> 01:58:20.580
<v Speaker 1>if it was you,</v>

4417
01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:23.570
<v Speaker 1>like if Brian was busted laundering money for drug,</v>

4418
01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:25.500
<v Speaker 1>you'd be in jail for the rest of your fucking life.</v>

4419
01:58:25.501 --> 01:58:26.334
<v Speaker 1>100%.</v>

4420
01:58:26.370 --> 01:58:29.100
<v Speaker 1>They take all of his fucking dryers and,</v>

4421
01:58:29.110 --> 01:58:29.820
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

4422
01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:31.290
<v Speaker 1>all this all is whirlpools.</v>

4423
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:32.251
<v Speaker 1>They'd get it.</v>

4424
01:58:32.251 --> 01:58:32.641
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

4425
01:58:32.641 --> 01:58:33.474
<v Speaker 1>he laundering,</v>

4426
01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:34.990
<v Speaker 1>he would really launder it.</v>

4427
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:36.103
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

4428
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:38.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like I can do that.</v>

4429
01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:41.390
<v Speaker 1>He'd have an iron and ironing board and turn it to super,</v>

4430
01:58:41.530 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 1>I could get</v>

4431
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.210
<v Speaker 5>more money out of super.</v>

4432
01:58:44.050 --> 01:58:46.980
<v Speaker 5>Are you trying to say that Brian is a child who's hockey?</v>

4433
01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:49.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to say,</v>

4434
01:58:49.181 --> 01:58:49.420

4500
02:00:29.410 --> 02:00:29.750
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4501
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:31.550
<v Speaker 5>did I get my hand raised in and not getting my hand raised?</v>

4502
02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:33.680
<v Speaker 5>When you go out on that stage,</v>

4503
02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:35.420

02:00:37.730 --> 02:00:37.941
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4506
02:00:37.941 --> 02:00:38.631
<v Speaker 5>You're supposed to be funny,</v>

4507
02:00:38.631 --> 02:00:39.110

02:00:39.110 --> 02:00:40.760
<v Speaker 5>So alright,</v>

4511
02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:43.971
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a shit.</v>

4512
02:00:43.971 --> 02:00:45.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking to Brian or having a drink,</v>

4513
02:00:45.351 --> 02:00:45.801
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

4514
02:00:45.801 --> 02:00:47.420
<v Speaker 5>some fucking noise off to my left.</v>

4515
02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:50.240
<v Speaker 5>I got to be interesting.</v>

4516
02:00:50.241 --> 02:00:53.450
<v Speaker 5>I got to do something that's going to draw their attention.</v>

4517
02:00:53.451 --> 02:00:54.410
<v Speaker 5>And once I've drawn it,</v>

4518
02:00:54.620 --> 02:00:55.453
<v Speaker 5>I need to keep it.</v>

4519
02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:56.121
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

4520
02:00:56.121 --> 02:00:56.954
<v Speaker 5>you got me.</v>

4521
02:00:57.530 --> 02:00:58.363
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

4522
02:00:59.150 --> 02:01:00.170
<v Speaker 5>why should I pay attention?</v>

4523
02:01:00.171 --> 02:01:00.621
<v Speaker 5>And so I,</v>

4524
02:01:00.621 --> 02:01:03.080
<v Speaker 5>there's this necessity to,</v>

4525
02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:03.490
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

4526
02:01:03.490 --> 02:01:05.270
<v Speaker 5>to be able to get a response for them,</v>

4527
02:01:05.271 --> 02:01:07.940
<v Speaker 5>which I understand from professional wrestling because I've been out in the ring</v>

4528
02:01:07.941 --> 02:01:08.480
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

4529
02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:11.240
<v Speaker 5>I listen to the crowd and I see what works and what doesn't work.</v>

4530
02:01:11.241 --> 02:01:12.920
<v Speaker 5>And so I have an understanding.</v>

4531
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:13.783
<v Speaker 5>I feel,</v>

4532
02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:14.181
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4533
02:01:14.181 --> 02:01:16.280
<v Speaker 5>and from being around yourself and other,</v>

4534
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.491
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4535
02:01:16.491 --> 02:01:17.324
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

4536
02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:18.770
<v Speaker 5>I've not like a talk about it a lot,</v>

4537
02:01:18.771 --> 02:01:20.470
<v Speaker 5>but I've hung out with quite a few comedians,</v>

4538
02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:21.141
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4539
02:01:21.141 --> 02:01:24.320
<v Speaker 5>been there backstage for their shows and we're fucking around warming up and</v>

4540
02:01:24.321 --> 02:01:25.220
<v Speaker 5>doing all this stuff and it's,</v>

4541
02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:26.360
<v Speaker 5>but I look at it and I go,</v>

4542
02:01:26.361 --> 02:01:29.630
<v Speaker 5>this is not just cracking jokes and making people laugh,</v>

4543
02:01:30.290 --> 02:01:32.690
<v Speaker 5>and it is okay to bomb because you're going to,</v>

4544
02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:33.800
<v Speaker 5>you're always going to fail.</v>

4545
02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:39.160
<v Speaker 5>But it's just such a raw personal to a degree,</v>

4546
02:01:40.491 --> 02:01:42.320
<v Speaker 5>to me it's just for ripening.</v>

4547
02:01:42.890 --> 02:01:43.730
<v Speaker 5>Utterly frightening.</v>

4548
02:01:43.850 --> 02:01:44.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4549
02:01:44.061 --> 02:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>You should definitely do it then.</v>

4550
02:01:45.110 --> 02:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Do it tonight.</v>

4551
02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:46.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not that hard.</v>

4552
02:01:47.090 --> 02:01:47.361
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4553
02:01:47.361 --> 02:01:47.780
<v Speaker 1>don't do,</v>

4554
02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:48.613
<v Speaker 1>don't listen to him.</v>

4555
02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to do it,</v>

4556
02:01:49.851 --> 02:01:50.780
<v Speaker 1>you should plan it out.</v>

4557
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I should definitely think about it and write some stuff down.</v>

4558
02:01:53.691 --> 02:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>I listen</v>

4559
02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:54.350
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

4560
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:59.090
<v Speaker 5>to things that you've said before about being a comedian from documentary stuff</v>

4561
02:01:59.091 --> 02:02:00.260
<v Speaker 5>and things that I've seen of you.</v>

4562
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:03.470
<v Speaker 5>And I have a thing in here,</v>

4563
02:02:03.471 --> 02:02:05.630
<v Speaker 5>in my notebook all on my phone.</v>

4564
02:02:06.290 --> 02:02:07.400
<v Speaker 5>Nothing but bits.</v>

4565
02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.823
<v Speaker 1>So you've thought about,</v>

4566
02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:09.281
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

4567
02:02:09.281 --> 02:02:09.421
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4568
02:02:09.421 --> 02:02:09.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4569
02:02:09.550 --> 02:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4570
02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:10.900
<v Speaker 1>I think about it.</v>

4571
02:02:10.901 --> 02:02:11.561
<v Speaker 1>I want you to do it.</v>

4572
02:02:11.561 --> 02:02:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Go to an open mic night.</v>

4573
02:02:12.491 --> 02:02:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it at a regular show.</v>

4574
02:02:13.661 --> 02:02:15.190
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to get you to do one of his shows.</v>

4575
02:02:15.191 --> 02:02:16.024
<v Speaker 1>Don't</v>

4576
02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:18.263
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

4577
02:02:18.730 --> 02:02:18.911
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4578

<v Speaker 5>maybe not,</v>

4724
02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:44.060
<v Speaker 5>but we know him as a personality on television,</v>

4725
02:05:44.190 --> 02:05:45.011
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

4726
02:05:45.011 --> 02:05:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking around.</v>

4727
02:05:46.111 --> 02:05:46.861
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with you,</v>

4728
02:05:46.861 --> 02:05:49.980
<v Speaker 1>they might just think you're a snob and I'm an athlete and I'm supposed to be</v>

4729
02:05:49.981 --> 02:05:51.270
<v Speaker 1>this and I'm supposed to be bad.</v>

4730
02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:55.830
<v Speaker 1>And so if I make off color jokes that are,</v>

4731
02:05:56.430 --> 02:05:56.820
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

4732
02:05:56.820 --> 02:05:57.180
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4733
02:05:57.180 --> 02:05:58.080
<v Speaker 1>that's too far,</v>

4734
02:05:58.110 --> 02:05:58.560
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

4735
02:05:58.560 --> 02:05:59.760
<v Speaker 1>When you retired from fighting,</v>

4736
02:05:59.790 --> 02:06:00.623
<v Speaker 1>how many more years?</v>

4737
02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:01.260
<v Speaker 1>How old are you now?</v>

4738
02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:03.060
<v Speaker 1>36 37 37.</v>

4739
02:06:03.090 --> 02:06:04.710
<v Speaker 1>How many more years do you think you'll be competing?</v>

4740
02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:05.101
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4741
02:06:05.101 --> 02:06:05.821
<v Speaker 1>till I'm done now.</v>

4742
02:06:05.821 --> 02:06:07.200
<v Speaker 1>See that's going on til I'm done.</v>

4743
02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:08.153
<v Speaker 1>Because</v>

4744
02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:10.640
<v Speaker 5>like I said before about that athletic window.</v>

4745
02:06:10.641 --> 02:06:14.270
<v Speaker 5>So Joe Rogan has a,</v>

4746
02:06:14.271 --> 02:06:14.541
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4747
02:06:14.541 --> 02:06:16.250
<v Speaker 5>this whole part of his whole career to stand up,</v>

4748
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:18.920
<v Speaker 5>very standup oriented and specific.</v>

4749
02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:20.060
<v Speaker 5>And then boom,</v>

4750
02:06:20.061 --> 02:06:21.530
<v Speaker 5>he moves into a movies and then he,</v>

4751
02:06:21.531 --> 02:06:22.970
<v Speaker 5>maybe he goes from there into politics.</v>

4752
02:06:22.971 --> 02:06:23.390
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4753
02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:26.420
<v Speaker 5>the thing is that you can enter any kind of line you want,</v>

4754
02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:30.170
<v Speaker 5>but those things are not incumbent on your physicality.</v>

4755
02:06:30.890 --> 02:06:32.360
<v Speaker 5>What they are is it's your mind.</v>

4756
02:06:32.361 --> 02:06:34.910
<v Speaker 5>It's your ability to fighting physicality.</v>

4757
02:06:34.911 --> 02:06:36.230
<v Speaker 5>Anything athletic wise,</v>

4758
02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:37.910
<v Speaker 5>you have so long to do it.</v>

4759
02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:39.673
<v Speaker 5>And that's it.</v>

4760
02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:42.140
<v Speaker 5>When that opportunity has passed,</v>

4761
02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:43.760
<v Speaker 5>you cannot do it anymore.</v>

4762
02:06:43.761 --> 02:06:45.090
<v Speaker 5>Now maybe you know,</v>

4763
02:06:45.091 --> 02:06:46.250
<v Speaker 5>you could say,</v>

4764
02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:46.701
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4765
02:06:46.701 --> 02:06:51.701
<v Speaker 5>well Joe went for the US national team for taekwondo to go to,</v>

4766
02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:54.770
<v Speaker 5>to win that and then go where in the world team trials and go to the Olympics.</v>

4767
02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:56.120
<v Speaker 5>Going to the Olympics is a,</v>

4768
02:06:56.121 --> 02:06:58.670
<v Speaker 5>is a short opportunity in life.</v>

4769
02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.210
<v Speaker 5>Once you get past that point where you can be competitive at that,</v>

4770
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:04.160
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't mean you can't do taekwondo anymore.</v>

4771
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:05.930
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't mean that you couldn't do other tournaments,</v>

4772
02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:09.110
<v Speaker 5>but trying to be the Olympic champion and taekwondo,</v>

4773
02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:09.441
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4774
02:07:09.441 --> 02:07:10.274
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

4775
02:07:10.930 --> 02:07:11.870
<v Speaker 5>that was gone.</v>

4776
02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:13.430
<v Speaker 5>That opportunity has passed me.</v>

4777
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:14.540
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>

4778
02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:15.560
<v Speaker 5>we're now opportunity to,</v>

4779
02:07:15.620 --> 02:07:19.070
<v Speaker 5>for me to be a successful high level fighter is gone.</v>

4780
02:07:19.071 --> 02:07:19.904
<v Speaker 5>It's gone.</v>

4781
02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:20.991
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

4782
02:07:20.991 --> 02:07:21.824
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

4783
02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:26.090
<v Speaker 1>You just have to personally assess when you feel like your body is not</v>

4784
02:07:26.091 --> 02:07:27.540
<v Speaker 1>performing the way you expect it to.</v>

4785
02:07:27.541 --> 02:07:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

4786
02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:28.960
<v Speaker 1>But right now you're cool with it</v>

4787
02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:29.381
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>

4788
02:07:29.381 --> 02:07:30.191
<v Speaker 5>I'm cool right now.</v>

4789
02:07:30.191 --> 02:07:32.860
<v Speaker 5>I know I can do a lot better than</v>

4790
02:07:33.130 --> 02:07:34.210
<v Speaker 1>last fight for sure.</v>

4791
02:07:34.300 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Why did you decide take so much time off</v>

4792
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:37.360
<v Speaker 5>between your last fight and now?</v>

4793
02:07:37.450 --> 02:07:39.580
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't into my last fight and be honest,</v>

4794
02:07:39.581 --> 02:07:40.414
<v Speaker 5>I didn't care.</v>

4795
02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:41.280
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

4796
02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:42.370
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't up for it.</v>

4797
02:07:42.730 --> 02:07:45.610
<v Speaker 5>I trained and I got to a point where I'm just like,</v>

4798
02:07:45.611 --> 02:07:46.444
<v Speaker 5>I'm over this.</v>

4799
02:07:46.690 --> 02:07:47.523
<v Speaker 5>You're over it.</v>

4800
02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:48.373
<v Speaker 5>Who are in town?</v>

4801
02:07:48.430 --> 02:07:49.181
<v Speaker 5>Who is this guy?</v>

4802
02:07:49.181 --> 02:07:50.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean Travis Brown.</v>

4803
02:07:50.411 --> 02:07:50.661
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

4804
02:07:50.661 --> 02:07:50.891
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4805
02:07:50.891 --> 02:07:51.724
<v Speaker 5>but it's just like,</v>

4806
02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:52.091
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4807
02:07:52.091 --> 02:07:52.781
<v Speaker 5>if I beat him,</v>

4808
02:07:52.781 --> 02:07:53.614
<v Speaker 5>what does that do?</v>

4809
02:07:53.770 --> 02:07:53.921
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4810
02:07:53.921 --> 02:07:55.150
<v Speaker 5>he's a top five fighter,</v>

4811
02:07:55.210 --> 02:07:55.810
<v Speaker 5>so what?</v>

4812
02:07:55.810 --> 02:07:58.600
<v Speaker 5>Then I get to not fight another guy and fight another guy and fight another guy</v>

4813
02:07:58.601 --> 02:07:59.171
<v Speaker 5>until it's like,</v>

4814
02:07:59.171 --> 02:07:59.321
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4815
02:07:59.321 --> 02:07:59.611
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>

4816
02:07:59.611 --> 02:08:00.700
<v Speaker 5>where am I going with this?</v>

4817
02:08:01.090 --> 02:08:03.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm in the grind and I'm trying to,</v>

4818
02:08:03.550 --> 02:08:06.850
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to climb this fucking ladder to prove that I deserve to fight for</v>

4819
02:08:06.851 --> 02:08:07.684
<v Speaker 5>a title.</v>

4820
02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:08.860
<v Speaker 5>I can fight for a title,</v>

4821
02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:10.510
<v Speaker 5>I guess anyone in any league,</v>

4822
02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:11.290
<v Speaker 5>anywhere,</v>

4823
02:08:11.290 --> 02:08:12.123
<v Speaker 5>anytime.</v>

4824
02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:15.670
<v Speaker 5>Fucking I'm a championship world champion level guy.</v>

4825
02:08:15.970 --> 02:08:18.160
<v Speaker 5>I don't need to prove that I belong here.</v>

4826
02:08:18.190 --> 02:08:20.830
<v Speaker 5>I've fought Travis Browne's all my career.</v>

4827
02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:23.620
<v Speaker 5>They just had a different name at a different point in life.</v>

4828
02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:25.000
<v Speaker 5>They had the same type of skillset.</v>

4829
02:08:25.130 --> 02:08:26.170
<v Speaker 5>They're basically the same guy.</v>

4830
02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:30.490
<v Speaker 5>There'll be another Travis Browne when Travis Browne is done being Travis</v>

4831
02:08:30.490 --> 02:08:31.323
<v Speaker 5>Browne.</v>

4832
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:33.490
<v Speaker 5>So what do you try to say that you,</v>

4833
02:08:33.670 --> 02:08:36.430
<v Speaker 5>the only thing that would get you up is a fight for a title.</v>

4834
02:08:36.610 --> 02:08:37.540
<v Speaker 5>Not necessarily,</v>

4835
02:08:37.541 --> 02:08:39.550
<v Speaker 5>but just I got to fight when it makes sense to me.</v>

4836
02:08:39.551 --> 02:08:41.680
<v Speaker 5>I got to fight when I'm motivated to do so.</v>

4837
02:08:41.950 --> 02:08:42.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

4838
02:08:42.550 --> 02:08:45.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm not looking to try and say,</v>

4839
02:08:46.030 --> 02:08:46.451
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

4840
02:08:46.451 --> 02:08:50.200
<v Speaker 5>throw me in there with all these other fucking goof balls and let us just beat</v>

4841
02:08:50.201 --> 02:08:53.050
<v Speaker 5>each other's heads in until we try to prove that we belong here.</v>

4842
02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:54.010
<v Speaker 5>Does that just signify,</v>

4843
02:08:54.011 --> 02:08:56.830
<v Speaker 5>look at the final chapter of your athletic career then?</v>

4844
02:08:56.831 --> 02:08:59.230
<v Speaker 5>Because if like a guy like Travis Browne,</v>

4845
02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:00.310
<v Speaker 5>if you were coming up,</v>

4846
02:09:00.340 --> 02:09:02.750
<v Speaker 5>you would relish the opportunity to fight a top five guy.</v>

4847
02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:03.520
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

4848
02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:05.800
<v Speaker 5>So is it because you just very established?</v>

4849
02:09:05.801 --> 02:09:06.940
<v Speaker 5>He'd been around a long time?</v>

4850
02:09:07.060 --> 02:09:09.180
<v Speaker 5>I've learned that I don't need to,</v>

4851
02:09:09.340 --> 02:09:11.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't need to prove myself in that way.</v>

4852
02:09:12.130 --> 02:09:12.670
<v Speaker 5>When I,</v>

4853
02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:13.361
<v Speaker 5>when I go to,</v>

4854
02:09:13.361 --> 02:09:13.680
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

4855
02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:13.860
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4856
02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:16.000
<v Speaker 5>I've been a top 10 fighter for over a decade.</v>

4857
02:09:16.060 --> 02:09:18.700
<v Speaker 5>I've been top five for over a decade most of the time.</v>

4858
02:09:18.701 --> 02:09:22.180
<v Speaker 5>So whether or not someone ranks me wherever they rank me,</v>

4859
02:09:22.181 --> 02:09:23.110
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't really matter.</v>

4860
02:09:23.530 --> 02:09:25.330
<v Speaker 5>I can step in there and do the job.</v>

4861
02:09:25.630 --> 02:09:28.960
<v Speaker 5>And this next fight might be against Roy,</v>

4862
02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:29.853
<v Speaker 5>which is fine,</v>

4863
02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:33.100
<v Speaker 5>but if then the next fight is we want you to fight cane or Buddhism or whoever,</v>

4864
02:09:33.101 --> 02:09:33.970
<v Speaker 5>like let's go,</v>

4865
02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:35.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking ready to do it.</v>

4866
02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:37.300
<v Speaker 5>But did you feel that when you fought Frank Mir?</v>

4867
02:09:37.660 --> 02:09:38.400
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4868
02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:39.610
<v Speaker 5>When I fought Frank Mir,</v>

4869
02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:43.420
<v Speaker 5>I was fucking pumped because for one I've been told,</v>

4870
02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:44.291
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4871
02:09:44.291 --> 02:09:45.190
<v Speaker 5>that I'd hear it.</v>

4872
02:09:45.191 --> 02:09:48.070
<v Speaker 5>All these people we think it's going to be deal is because he's such a tough</v>

4873
02:09:48.071 --> 02:09:48.490
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>

4874
02:09:48.490 --> 02:09:48.860
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4875
02:09:48.860 --> 02:09:49.780
<v Speaker 5>and Frank Mir is,</v>

4876
02:09:49.781 --> 02:09:51.370
<v Speaker 5>he's the piece of the best submission guy.</v>

4877
02:09:51.371 --> 02:09:53.620
<v Speaker 5>And or back when I was in the UFC,</v>

4878
02:09:53.850 --> 02:09:54.683
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4879
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:56.110
<v Speaker 5>and frank was just coming up,</v>

4880
02:09:56.111 --> 02:09:56.351
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

4881
02:09:56.351 --> 02:09:56.441
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4882
02:09:56.441 --> 02:09:57.550
<v Speaker 5>this guy's the future.</v>

4883
02:09:57.551 --> 02:09:58.390
<v Speaker 5>He's the best.</v>

4884
02:09:58.391 --> 02:09:59.500
<v Speaker 5>He's going to be the greatest.</v>

4885
02:09:59.501 --> 02:10:03.280
<v Speaker 5>And always hearing all this stuff about how Frank Mir is my equal or better.</v>

4886
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:04.743
<v Speaker 5>And I'm just like,</v>

4887
02:10:05.050 --> 02:10:06.550
<v Speaker 5>this shit is over with.</v>

4888
02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:08.021
<v Speaker 5>This is not,</v>

4889
02:10:08.021 --> 02:10:10.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to show you the difference between us,</v>

4890
02:10:10.930 --> 02:10:11.830
<v Speaker 5>between him and me.</v>

4891
02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:13.360
<v Speaker 5>So you were excited about him.</v>

4892
02:10:13.361 --> 02:10:14.530
<v Speaker 5>That was a very important fight.</v>

4893
02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:14.980
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4894
02:10:14.980 --> 02:10:16.370
<v Speaker 5>That was a Travis Brown wasn't it?</v>

4895
02:10:16.371 --> 02:10:17.080
<v Speaker 5>Didn't care.</v>

4896
02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:17.410
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

4897
02:10:17.410 --> 02:10:18.420
<v Speaker 5>That's Kinda crazy.</v>

4898
02:10:18.660 --> 02:10:19.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4899
02:10:19.390 --> 02:10:19.991
<v Speaker 5>that's w well,</v>

4900
02:10:19.991 --> 02:10:21.370
<v Speaker 5>I guess that's a personal thing,</v>

4901
02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:21.611
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4902
02:10:21.611 --> 02:10:23.020
<v Speaker 5>Your own personal motivation,</v>

4903
02:10:23.021 --> 02:10:27.220
<v Speaker 5>like the only person who could decide what fights are up for and when fights or</v>

4904
02:10:27.221 --> 02:10:28.030
<v Speaker 5>not are you?</v>

4905
02:10:28.030 --> 02:10:28.630
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

4906
02:10:28.630 --> 02:10:29.200
<v Speaker 5>Would you be,</v>

4907
02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:30.430
<v Speaker 5>would you be up for a rematch?</v>

4908
02:10:30.431 --> 02:10:32.110
<v Speaker 5>Like if they offered you a rematch with Travis,</v>

4909
02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:33.040
<v Speaker 5>here's the difference.</v>

4910
02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:34.280
<v Speaker 5>If I fight Travis</v>

4911
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:38.330
<v Speaker 2>now I'm going to want to fucking take his head off because he disrespected me in</v>

4912
02:10:38.331 --> 02:10:39.440
<v Speaker 2>the ring after the match.</v>

4913
02:10:39.441 --> 02:10:41.770
<v Speaker 2>He did all this fucking shit and it's like,</v>

4914
02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:42.351
<v Speaker 2>what did they do?</v>

4915
02:10:42.351 --> 02:10:43.880
<v Speaker 2>What did he fucking cut his throat?</v>

4916
02:10:43.881 --> 02:10:44.661
<v Speaker 2>He did all this stuff,</v>

4917
02:10:44.661 --> 02:10:46.430
<v Speaker 2>but don't you do that to you do that all the time.</v>

4918
02:10:46.431 --> 02:10:47.390
<v Speaker 2>I have to do my thing.</v>

4919
02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:49.910
<v Speaker 2>He did it to mock me and I'm just like,</v>

4920
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.331
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

4921
02:10:50.331 --> 02:10:55.331
<v Speaker 2>I've been nice to you and respectful to you from day one and then you go ahead</v>

4922
02:10:55.701 --> 02:10:56.840
<v Speaker 2>and you go and you get a win on me.</v>

4923
02:10:56.841 --> 02:10:57.674
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

4924
02:10:58.070 --> 02:11:01.400
<v Speaker 2>This is your moment to say what you want to say and what you want to do is to</v>

4925
02:11:01.401 --> 02:11:03.980
<v Speaker 2>try and fucking put me down after you win.</v>

4926
02:11:04.730 --> 02:11:06.380
<v Speaker 2>So you feel like by him doing this,</v>

4927
02:11:06.381 --> 02:11:10.160
<v Speaker 2>the thumb across the neck thing and apparently he was very dismissive of me and</v>

4928
02:11:10.161 --> 02:11:11.480
<v Speaker 2>interviews and all this shit and I'm like,</v>

4929
02:11:11.481 --> 02:11:11.691
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

4930
02:11:11.691 --> 02:11:12.280
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

4931
02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:12.900
<v Speaker 2>What do you disagree?</v>

4932
02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:13.733
<v Speaker 2>You're a post,</v>

4933
02:11:13.850 --> 02:11:14.300
<v Speaker 2>post,</v>

4934
02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:14.661
<v Speaker 2>post,</v>

4935
02:11:14.661 --> 02:11:15.081
<v Speaker 2>post,</v>

4936
02:11:15.081 --> 02:11:15.231
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

4937
02:11:15.231 --> 02:11:16.064
<v Speaker 2>Everything is post.</v>

4938
02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Everything was post and I didn't find out about this shit until way after the</v>

4939
02:11:19.431 --> 02:11:19.731
<v Speaker 2>fact.</v>

4940
02:11:19.731 --> 02:11:22.550
<v Speaker 2>I actually saw him backstage and come up and shook his hand and said,</v>

4941
02:11:22.551 --> 02:11:22.851
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

4942
02:11:22.851 --> 02:11:23.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4943
02:11:23.091 --> 02:11:23.271
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4944
02:11:23.271 --> 02:11:24.104
<v Speaker 2>this was your night.</v>

4945
02:11:24.860 --> 02:11:25.610
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

4946
02:11:25.610 --> 02:11:27.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any reason to be a fucking prick,</v>

4947
02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:28.700
<v Speaker 2>especially after I win.</v>

4948
02:11:28.730 --> 02:11:30.800
<v Speaker 2>But you know what a guy wins.</v>

4949
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:32.450
<v Speaker 2>He feels like he's on top of the world.</v>

4950
02:11:32.990 --> 02:11:33.620
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

4951
02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:35.330
<v Speaker 2>That's when you're going to say some shit like that.</v>

4952
02:11:35.331 --> 02:11:37.370
<v Speaker 2>That's when you're going to act out and then,</v>

4953
02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:38.990
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

4954
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.291
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

4955
02:11:39.291 --> 02:11:39.711
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

4956
02:11:39.711 --> 02:11:40.071
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

4957
02:11:40.071 --> 02:11:40.281
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

4958
02:11:40.281 --> 02:11:42.080
<v Speaker 2>If that's the way it's going to be awesome.</v>

4959
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:43.250
<v Speaker 2>If we rematch,</v>

4960
02:11:43.250 --> 02:11:45.230
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be the same dude you fought that night.</v>

4961
02:11:45.231 --> 02:11:46.400
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea.</v>

4962
02:11:46.610 --> 02:11:47.660
<v Speaker 2>You really don't get it.</v>

4963
02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:48.860
<v Speaker 2>You were,</v>

4964
02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:52.210
<v Speaker 2>you will get your ass handed to you because now you made,</v>

4965
02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:55.190
<v Speaker 2>you gave me a reason to want to kick your ass and what would be the difference</v>

4966
02:11:55.191 --> 02:11:57.260
<v Speaker 2>between the way you would perform in this fight?</v>

4967
02:11:57.290 --> 02:11:57.980
<v Speaker 2>The way he performed,</v>

4968
02:11:57.980 --> 02:11:59.160
<v Speaker 2>the first fight I look for,</v>

4969
02:11:59.161 --> 02:11:59.750
<v Speaker 2>for one,</v>

4970
02:11:59.750 --> 02:12:03.140
<v Speaker 2>I would make him pay for all of the big mistakes he makes all the time.</v>

4971
02:12:03.710 --> 02:12:04.071
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

4972
02:12:04.071 --> 02:12:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Big mistakes.</v>

4973
02:12:04.700 --> 02:12:07.400
<v Speaker 2>He's constantly wiffen throwing the biggest shots.</v>

4974
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:12.430
<v Speaker 2>That kid has no stamina because he will always go for the kill and everything he</v>

4975
02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:13.191
<v Speaker 2>does now,</v>

4976
02:12:13.191 --> 02:12:15.410
<v Speaker 2>if that makes him very dangerous to a heavyweight,</v>

4977
02:12:15.411 --> 02:12:18.140
<v Speaker 2>especially because he's athletic and he's got some power,</v>

4978
02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:21.890
<v Speaker 2>but that's why I've heard him took him out because he's missing with all this</v>

4979
02:12:21.891 --> 02:12:24.770
<v Speaker 2>big shit and you're getting picked apart and picked apart and picked apart and</v>

4980
02:12:24.771 --> 02:12:27.950
<v Speaker 2>hung on and hung on and grabbed in separate and picked apart and picked apart.</v>

4981
02:12:29.150 --> 02:12:29.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4982
02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:31.490
<v Speaker 2>why is Varun beating you on the feet?</v>

4983
02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:35.630
<v Speaker 2>Because he broke his hand early in the first round two.</v>

4984
02:12:35.631 --> 02:12:36.590
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why.</v>

4985
02:12:36.650 --> 02:12:36.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4986
02:12:36.921 --> 02:12:38.840
<v Speaker 2>well it's also because he's trying,</v>

4987
02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:42.320
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to swing for the fences constantly.</v>

4988
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4989
02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:44.960
<v Speaker 2>That's why he's gassed and every one of his big fights,</v>

4990
02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:47.360
<v Speaker 2>any fight that's got any kind of distance to it,</v>

4991
02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:48.373
<v Speaker 2>he's gassed.</v>

4992
02:12:48.530 --> 02:12:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

4993
02:12:48.980 --> 02:12:50.690
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the type of fighter he is.</v>

4994
02:12:52.070 --> 02:12:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Does that make them a bad fighter?</v>

4995
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily.</v>

4996
02:12:54.590 --> 02:12:55.530
<v Speaker 2>I would say it doesn't.</v>

4997
02:12:55.580 --> 02:12:56.870
<v Speaker 2>It's just that's who he is.</v>

4998
02:12:56.930 --> 02:12:57.950
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking wild man.</v>

4999
02:12:57.980 --> 02:13:02.980
<v Speaker 2>But that's also why I think he will never be a UFC champion because there's a</v>

5000
02:13:03.141 --> 02:13:05.030
<v Speaker 2>finesse the he doesn't possess.</v>

5001
02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:07.070
<v Speaker 2>But don't you think that that's something you can learn?</v>

5002
02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:07.311
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5003
02:13:07.311 --> 02:13:10.190
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy who is still sort of evolving as a fighter.</v>

5004
02:13:10.191 --> 02:13:11.024
<v Speaker 2>He has him,</v>

5005
02:13:11.210 --> 02:13:11.361
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5006
02:13:11.361 --> 02:13:13.700
<v Speaker 2>he came into MMA fairly late.</v>

5007
02:13:13.730 --> 02:13:15.940
<v Speaker 2>It was a basketball player and what will,</v>

5008
02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:16.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5009
02:13:16.191 --> 02:13:16.850
<v Speaker 2>time will tell.</v>

5010
02:13:16.850 --> 02:13:18.020
<v Speaker 2>It's up to him really.</v>

5011
02:13:18.110 --> 02:13:19.610
<v Speaker 2>And I've got a personal thing with him.</v>

5012
02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:20.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5013
02:13:20.210 --> 02:13:22.970
<v Speaker 2>but here I'm being objective and that is,</v>

5014
02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:24.253
<v Speaker 2>it's up to him.</v>

5015
02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:26.210
<v Speaker 2>If he wants to make those decisions,</v>

5016
02:13:26.211 --> 02:13:27.920
<v Speaker 2>if he wants to change his game,</v>

5017
02:13:27.921 --> 02:13:29.540
<v Speaker 2>if he wants to add different aspects to it,</v>

5018
02:13:29.541 --> 02:13:34.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean all fighters are the true or architects of their own design.</v>

5019
02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:37.050
<v Speaker 2>The coaches can help.</v>

5020
02:13:37.051 --> 02:13:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Edmund can,</v>

5021
02:13:37.770 --> 02:13:42.770
<v Speaker 2>can help him in one way and show him how to strike under these concepts or maybe</v>

5022
02:13:43.321 --> 02:13:47.340
<v Speaker 2>show the same things that he's been taught at Jackson's or someplace else but</v>

5023
02:13:47.341 --> 02:13:50.250
<v Speaker 2>said in a different way so that it becomes more clear to him.</v>

5024
02:13:50.550 --> 02:13:51.383
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5025
02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:53.190
<v Speaker 2>and I think Edmond is a good striking coach.</v>

5026
02:13:53.191 --> 02:13:54.330
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him work with Rhonda.</v>

5027
02:13:54.331 --> 02:13:55.200
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him work with,</v>

5028
02:13:55.201 --> 02:13:55.770
<v Speaker 2>with some of the,</v>

5029
02:13:55.770 --> 02:13:57.600
<v Speaker 2>with the girls and uh,</v>

5030
02:13:57.630 --> 02:13:58.171
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

5031
02:13:58.171 --> 02:14:00.300
<v Speaker 2>and I like what he has to teach.</v>

5032
02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:06.140
<v Speaker 2>I also don't believe that at Greg's that there wasn't that there was any lack of</v>

5033
02:14:06.271 --> 02:14:09.230
<v Speaker 2>striking quality striking training or I,</v>

5034
02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:12.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to say the Edmunds striking training is going to be better than</v>

5035
02:14:12.211 --> 02:14:13.740
<v Speaker 2>whatever was it was Jackson's,</v>

5036
02:14:13.741 --> 02:14:14.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say it's different.</v>

5037
02:14:15.450 --> 02:14:15.871
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

5038
02:14:15.871 --> 02:14:16.800
<v Speaker 2>And I know it's good,</v>

5039
02:14:16.801 --> 02:14:17.041
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

5040
02:14:17.041 --> 02:14:19.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure the Jacksons was good too.</v>

5041
02:14:19.540 --> 02:14:21.090
<v Speaker 2>And to make that change.</v>

5042
02:14:21.091 --> 02:14:25.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean only he knows specifically why he decided to change camps.</v>

5043
02:14:25.530 --> 02:14:25.951
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

5044
02:14:25.951 --> 02:14:26.784
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5045
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.440
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion it's not,</v>

5046
02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:30.840
<v Speaker 2>it's not about being here or there,</v>

5047
02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:33.150
<v Speaker 2>it's about what he does to,</v>

5048
02:14:33.210 --> 02:14:34.680
<v Speaker 2>to affect his game.</v>

5049
02:14:34.681 --> 02:14:34.981
<v Speaker 2>It's what,</v>

5050
02:14:34.981 --> 02:14:37.350
<v Speaker 2>what changes he decides to make in his own head.</v>

5051
02:14:37.351 --> 02:14:41.040
<v Speaker 2>The way he approaches his training and how he tries to take what he's learning</v>

5052
02:14:41.430 --> 02:14:46.140
<v Speaker 2>and apply it to what he does already and apply it in different ways.</v>

5053
02:14:46.590 --> 02:14:46.801
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5054
02:14:46.801 --> 02:14:47.940
<v Speaker 2>that's what it comes down to.</v>

5055
02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:51.720
<v Speaker 2>I think Edmonds given them more individualized attention and really focusing on</v>

5056
02:14:51.721 --> 02:14:56.721
<v Speaker 2>him as an athlete because he only has a small stable of fighters maybe.</v>

5057
02:14:57.060 --> 02:14:57.893
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

5058
02:14:58.230 --> 02:14:59.063
<v Speaker 2>in the end,</v>

5059
02:14:59.190 --> 02:14:59.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5060
02:14:59.610 --> 02:15:02.610
<v Speaker 2>coaches lay the foundation,</v>

5061
02:15:02.611 --> 02:15:02.881
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

5062
02:15:02.881 --> 02:15:03.180
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

5063
02:15:03.180 --> 02:15:04.710
<v Speaker 2>they point you in the right direction,</v>

5064
02:15:05.010 --> 02:15:09.090
<v Speaker 2>but athletes take that information and they make the most of it.</v>

5065
02:15:09.690 --> 02:15:10.710
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

5066
02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:13.290
<v Speaker 2>how much time in a day can you spend with that coach?</v>

5067
02:15:13.650 --> 02:15:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Only so much.</v>

5068
02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:16.740
<v Speaker 2>It's the time that you're not spending with them.</v>

5069
02:15:16.890 --> 02:15:18.390
<v Speaker 2>That really makes a big difference.</v>

5070
02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:20.970
<v Speaker 2>How do you take what they gave you?</v>

5071
02:15:20.971 --> 02:15:23.160
<v Speaker 2>How are you working on that when you're not in the gym?</v>

5072
02:15:23.161 --> 02:15:24.090
<v Speaker 2>How are you thinking about it?</v>

5073
02:15:24.091 --> 02:15:26.850
<v Speaker 2>How are you breaking down your strengths and your weaknesses and,</v>

5074
02:15:26.970 --> 02:15:27.960
<v Speaker 2>and dealing with those?</v>

5075
02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:33.560
<v Speaker 2>How are you then coming back to the gym with that knowledge and then training</v>

5076
02:15:35.191 --> 02:15:36.024
<v Speaker 2>the next day?</v>

5077
02:15:36.180 --> 02:15:40.110
<v Speaker 2>How are you setting your mind for training that day?</v>

5078
02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:40.381
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5079
02:15:40.381 --> 02:15:41.610
<v Speaker 2>you could have the worst day in the world,</v>

5080
02:15:41.611 --> 02:15:42.960
<v Speaker 2>but if your jab got better,</v>

5081
02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:44.093
<v Speaker 2>so what,</v>

5082
02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:44.461
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5083
02:15:44.461 --> 02:15:45.294
<v Speaker 2>It's a success.</v>

5084
02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Does it,</v>

5085
02:15:46.110 --> 02:15:47.910
<v Speaker 2>does it bug you that fine?</v>

5086
02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>

5087
02:15:49.010 --> 02:15:49.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5088
02:15:49.291 --> 02:15:53.160
<v Speaker 2>you look back in the fact that you didn't get up for it and you had that result.</v>

5089
02:15:53.310 --> 02:15:53.671
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

5090
02:15:53.671 --> 02:15:56.010
<v Speaker 2>of course it bugs me and it just,</v>

5091
02:15:56.011 --> 02:16:01.011
<v Speaker 2>as Travis has bugged from losing his fight versus virgin because he had an</v>

5092
02:16:01.801 --> 02:16:03.990
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to fight for the title after that,</v>

5093
02:16:03.991 --> 02:16:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure is the way he saw it.</v>

5094
02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:06.980
<v Speaker 2>And he lost his opportunity here.</v>

5095
02:16:06.990 --> 02:16:07.290
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

5096
02:16:07.290 --> 02:16:08.080
<v Speaker 2>he may feel it was,</v>

5097
02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:09.570
<v Speaker 2>it was hand or you know,</v>

5098
02:16:09.571 --> 02:16:11.370
<v Speaker 2>when he got kicked in the ribs or whatever.</v>

5099
02:16:11.371 --> 02:16:13.110
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really matter what it was.</v>

5100
02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:14.640
<v Speaker 2>We lost.</v>

5101
02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:16.740
<v Speaker 2>We lost in these moments.</v>

5102
02:16:16.890 --> 02:16:17.730
<v Speaker 2>And as a fighter,</v>

5103
02:16:17.731 --> 02:16:19.260
<v Speaker 2>you always should.</v>

5104
02:16:19.860 --> 02:16:20.191
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

5105
02:16:20.191 --> 02:16:25.110
<v Speaker 2>that's something that I know when I don't care if I lost or not,</v>

5106
02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:26.670
<v Speaker 2>that's when I should stop fighting.</v>

5107
02:16:27.210 --> 02:16:28.043
<v Speaker 2>I cared.</v>

5108
02:16:28.050 --> 02:16:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I cared that I lost,</v>

5109
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:33.310
<v Speaker 5>I cared a lot more when I got disrespected over it,</v>

5110
02:16:33.311 --> 02:16:35.770
<v Speaker 5>which I felt was completely unnecessary.</v>

5111
02:16:35.771 --> 02:16:36.460
<v Speaker 5>That's just suck.</v>

5112
02:16:36.460 --> 02:16:37.120
<v Speaker 5>That was like,</v>

5113
02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:37.691
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

5114
02:16:37.691 --> 02:16:38.290
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

5115
02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:38.801
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

5116
02:16:38.801 --> 02:16:39.840
<v Speaker 5>Why did you have to do that?</v>

5117
02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:41.530
<v Speaker 3>So if you got you can't,</v>

5118
02:16:41.531 --> 02:16:43.360
<v Speaker 3>you have a hard time getting up for Travis.</v>

5119
02:16:43.390 --> 02:16:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Why do you not have a hard time getting up for Roy Nelson?</v>

5120
02:16:45.940 --> 02:16:46.780
<v Speaker 3>Because</v>

5121
02:16:47.170 --> 02:16:48.003
<v Speaker 5>for one,</v>

5122
02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:49.113
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5123
02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:50.240
<v Speaker 5>I've had some time to,</v>

5124
02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:55.150
<v Speaker 5>to just do other stuff and get that fire wanting to get back in the ring too.</v>

5125
02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:56.171
<v Speaker 5>I'm not looking at,</v>

5126
02:16:56.171 --> 02:16:56.831
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at funding.</v>

5127
02:16:56.831 --> 02:16:57.730
<v Speaker 5>Roy's fighting Roy.</v>

5128
02:16:57.940 --> 02:17:02.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm not looking at fighting Roy as I'm fighting Roy so that I can prove that I</v>

5129
02:17:02.321 --> 02:17:07.210
<v Speaker 5>can fight Joe Smith next so that I can fight whoever and then get a title shot.</v>

5130
02:17:07.690 --> 02:17:08.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing that.</v>

5131
02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:10.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm fighting Roy because I'm fighting Roy.</v>

5132
02:17:11.050 --> 02:17:11.591
<v Speaker 5>Me and Roy,</v>

5133
02:17:11.591 --> 02:17:12.370
<v Speaker 5>you're going to fight.</v>

5134
02:17:12.370 --> 02:17:12.851
<v Speaker 5>So you have a,</v>

5135
02:17:12.851 --> 02:17:14.590
<v Speaker 5>just a different mindset than you had before.</v>

5136
02:17:14.591 --> 02:17:15.180
<v Speaker 5>The trout was for.</v>

5137
02:17:15.180 --> 02:17:15.820
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

5138
02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:17.770
<v Speaker 5>And with Roy,</v>

5139
02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:20.890
<v Speaker 5>he's been around a very long time himself.</v>

5140
02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:23.140
<v Speaker 5>And so I've heard things here and there,</v>

5141
02:17:23.410 --> 02:17:23.651
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5142
02:17:23.651 --> 02:17:28.651
<v Speaker 5>really one time it was on a big rant online on Twitter about people being ranked</v>

5143
02:17:29.801 --> 02:17:30.880
<v Speaker 5>over him and why,</v>

5144
02:17:30.881 --> 02:17:31.570
<v Speaker 5>why is that?</v>

5145
02:17:31.570 --> 02:17:31.931
<v Speaker 5>So he's,</v>

5146
02:17:31.931 --> 02:17:35.470
<v Speaker 5>he's arguing with all these major journalists and then he starts adding my name</v>

5147
02:17:35.471 --> 02:17:35.771
<v Speaker 5>into it.</v>

5148
02:17:35.771 --> 02:17:38.620
<v Speaker 5>Like literally putting my handle and I'm just like,</v>

5149
02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:40.230
<v Speaker 5>why do you give a fuck about,</v>

5150
02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:41.590
<v Speaker 5>in my only response was,</v>

5151
02:17:41.591 --> 02:17:42.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5152
02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:44.680
<v Speaker 5>finding wants to talk about how he thinks he's better than me or whatever.</v>

5153
02:17:44.681 --> 02:17:45.514
<v Speaker 5>Who Cares?</v>

5154
02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:48.010
<v Speaker 5>My only response was who gives a shit?</v>

5155
02:17:48.011 --> 02:17:49.240
<v Speaker 5>What other people think about you?</v>

5156
02:17:49.570 --> 02:17:51.100
<v Speaker 5>Why are you even including me in this?</v>

5157
02:17:51.101 --> 02:17:51.934
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>

5158
02:17:52.090 --> 02:17:52.531
<v Speaker 3>Was there anything,</v>

5159
02:17:52.531 --> 02:17:54.450
<v Speaker 3>he's just trying to drum up fight or whatever.</v>

5160
02:17:54.451 --> 02:17:55.231
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

5161
02:17:55.231 --> 02:17:57.090
<v Speaker 3>It looks at list of potential opponents.</v>

5162
02:17:57.300 --> 02:17:58.860
<v Speaker 3>It feels he matches up well with you.</v>

5163
02:17:58.861 --> 02:18:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Throw your name into the mix.</v>

5164
02:18:00.001 --> 02:18:00.460
<v Speaker 3>Use Your,</v>

5165
02:18:00.460 --> 02:18:02.940
<v Speaker 3>you're at Shell Barnett,</v>

5166
02:18:03.090 --> 02:18:03.670
<v Speaker 5>you know at,</v>

5167
02:18:03.670 --> 02:18:04.231
<v Speaker 5>at the time,</v>

5168
02:18:04.231 --> 02:18:06.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't even think I was in the UFC so it's not like we could have fought</v>

5169
02:18:06.361 --> 02:18:07.194
<v Speaker 5>anyways.</v>

5170
02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:07.841
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5171
02:18:07.841 --> 02:18:10.240
<v Speaker 3>he probably knew you were coming over from Strikeforce.</v>

5172
02:18:10.241 --> 02:18:10.750
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5173
02:18:10.750 --> 02:18:11.110
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

5174
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:12.750
<v Speaker 3>Everybody thought you were coming over a few,</v>

5175
02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:13.593
<v Speaker 3>not work out the deal.</v>

5176
02:18:13.900 --> 02:18:14.081
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5177
02:18:14.081 --> 02:18:15.850
<v Speaker 3>you were always a top level guy,</v>

5178
02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:16.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5179
02:18:16.350 --> 02:18:20.710
<v Speaker 3>It's sub someone that a lot of different fighters wanted to have as a potential.</v>

5180
02:18:20.860 --> 02:18:21.301
<v Speaker 3>You were,</v>

5181
02:18:21.301 --> 02:18:21.481
<v Speaker 3>hi,</v>

5182
02:18:21.481 --> 02:18:22.150
<v Speaker 3>my name,</v>

5183
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:22.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5184
02:18:22.510 --> 02:18:23.350
<v Speaker 3>high marquee.</v>

5185
02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:27.730
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't that long ago that anybody ever started actually calling me out.</v>

5186
02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:29.080
<v Speaker 5>Like most of my career.</v>

5187
02:18:29.081 --> 02:18:29.771
<v Speaker 5>No one's ever said,</v>

5188
02:18:29.771 --> 02:18:30.640
<v Speaker 5>I want to fight that guy.</v>

5189
02:18:32.310 --> 02:18:32.930
<v Speaker 5>So what,</v>

5190
02:18:32.930 --> 02:18:33.850
<v Speaker 5>what do you attribute it to?</v>

5191
02:18:34.060 --> 02:18:34.361
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5192
02:18:34.361 --> 02:18:34.991
<v Speaker 5>I'm older.</v>

5193
02:18:34.991 --> 02:18:35.890
<v Speaker 5>I had a bad loss,</v>

5194
02:18:35.891 --> 02:18:36.730
<v Speaker 5>my last match.</v>

5195
02:18:36.731 --> 02:18:36.911
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5196
02:18:36.911 --> 02:18:38.320
<v Speaker 5>maybe they think that they see it's,</v>

5197
02:18:38.321 --> 02:18:38.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5198
02:18:38.950 --> 02:18:40.390
<v Speaker 5>it's more worthwhile to do that.</v>

5199
02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:43.870
<v Speaker 5>But even guys that had gotten wins over me went through fucking hell to do it.</v>

5200
02:18:44.530 --> 02:18:46.040
<v Speaker 5>So there isn't,</v>

5201
02:18:46.100 --> 02:18:46.933
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

5202
02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:47.893
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't make sense.</v>

5203
02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:49.113
<v Speaker 5>I don't blame them.</v>

5204
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5205
02:18:49.810 --> 02:18:50.643
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

5206
02:18:50.890 --> 02:18:52.000
<v Speaker 5>if I see a guy,</v>

5207
02:18:52.810 --> 02:18:56.110
<v Speaker 5>if I have a fighter and I can avoid having a fight that's winnable,</v>

5208
02:18:56.410 --> 02:18:58.030
<v Speaker 5>but it's going to be fucking really tough.</v>

5209
02:18:58.280 --> 02:18:58.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5210
02:18:58.620 --> 02:19:00.690
<v Speaker 5>I would try not to make that fight happened.</v>

5211
02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:03.340
<v Speaker 5>I would try to get them a fight where it may be,</v>

5212
02:19:04.650 --> 02:19:05.483
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5213
02:19:05.510 --> 02:19:06.700
<v Speaker 5>a more dangerous fight,</v>

5214
02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:07.930
<v Speaker 5>but much more,</v>

5215
02:19:08.460 --> 02:19:09.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5216
02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:11.290
<v Speaker 5>skews in the way of once you get going,</v>

5217
02:19:11.291 --> 02:19:12.430
<v Speaker 5>you can put them away,</v>

5218
02:19:12.940 --> 02:19:15.340
<v Speaker 5>but you got to watch out because this guy can put you away.</v>

5219
02:19:15.341 --> 02:19:20.341
<v Speaker 5>Versus this guy's going to make you fight and scratch and claw for every inch of</v>

5220
02:19:20.441 --> 02:19:22.210
<v Speaker 5>every second of this fucking match.</v>

5221
02:19:22.390 --> 02:19:23.860
<v Speaker 5>Whether he's winning and he's losing,</v>

5222
02:19:23.890 --> 02:19:25.840
<v Speaker 5>he'll just never fucking quit like that.</v>

5223
02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:26.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5224
02:19:26.770 --> 02:19:27.560
<v Speaker 5>And that's you.</v>

5225
02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:27.920
<v Speaker 5>I will,</v>

5226
02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:32.090
<v Speaker 5>I break my hand and 23 seconds finding Cormier and I still hit him with it.</v>

5227
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:33.103
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

5228
02:19:34.420 --> 02:19:38.530
<v Speaker 3>And this is a type of fight that you think would be that kind of dog fight.</v>

5229
02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:39.393
<v Speaker 3>You and Roy?</v>

5230
02:19:39.470 --> 02:19:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5231
02:19:39.790 --> 02:19:39.971
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5232
02:19:39.971 --> 02:19:40.990
<v Speaker 3>he's hard to put away.</v>

5233
02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:41.990
<v Speaker 3>He is hard to find.</v>

5234
02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:42.853
<v Speaker 3>I'm a finisher.</v>

5235
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:46.590
<v Speaker 3>She's just crisis fight with Alistair Overeem was crazy to watch him.</v>

5236
02:19:46.610 --> 02:19:47.311
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see it,</v>

5237
02:19:47.311 --> 02:19:47.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5238
02:19:47.500 --> 02:19:49.600
<v Speaker 3>but I heard this kicks to the body,</v>

5239
02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:51.180
<v Speaker 3>saw walk,</v>

5240
02:19:51.220 --> 02:19:52.390
<v Speaker 3>saw walk.</v>

5241
02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:52.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5242
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Alistair was just laying into him.</v>

5243
02:19:54.580 --> 02:19:55.840
<v Speaker 3>He had kicked him,</v>

5244
02:19:56.200 --> 02:19:56.710
<v Speaker 3>he hit,</v>

5245
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:58.420
<v Speaker 3>he kicked the shit out of his legs.</v>

5246
02:19:58.421 --> 02:20:00.070
<v Speaker 3>And Roy just keeps coming forward.</v>

5247
02:20:00.460 --> 02:20:02.300
<v Speaker 3>Alice just says it was like the incredible hulk.</v>

5248
02:20:02.301 --> 02:20:06.070
<v Speaker 3>Like he just got angrier and angrier and angrier and see his eyes get crazy.</v>

5249
02:20:06.100 --> 02:20:07.600
<v Speaker 3>He's a wild motherfucker Roy.</v>

5250
02:20:07.780 --> 02:20:08.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5251
02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Hard to believe that he didn't even start striking training till 2009.</v>

5252
02:20:11.740 --> 02:20:12.810
<v Speaker 3>That's when he started striking try.</v>

5253
02:20:12.820 --> 02:20:13.630
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

5254
02:20:13.630 --> 02:20:14.450
<v Speaker 3>That's what he said.</v>

5255
02:20:14.450 --> 02:20:14.680
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

5256
02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:15.950
<v Speaker 3>He had to come food background too.</v>

5257
02:20:16.420 --> 02:20:17.253
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5258
02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:18.533
<v Speaker 3>did it really?</v>

5259
02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5260
02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:19.261
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5261
02:20:19.261 --> 02:20:19.990
<v Speaker 3>but what does it,</v>

5262
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.823
<v Speaker 3>what does that</v>

5263
02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:21.940
<v Speaker 5>look?</v>

5264
02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:24.040
<v Speaker 5>He know he knew about throwing a punch like this.</v>

5265
02:20:24.041 --> 02:20:26.010
<v Speaker 5>I saw him overhand.</v>

5266
02:20:26.011 --> 02:20:26.291
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5267
02:20:26.291 --> 02:20:27.280
<v Speaker 5>A guy and knock them out.</v>

02:20:28.780 --> 02:20:29.290
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

5270
02:20:29.290 --> 02:20:29.650
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

5271
02:20:29.650 --> 02:20:30.400
<v Speaker 5>Costa Rica.</v>

5272
02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:30.670
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

5273
02:20:30.670 --> 02:20:31.503
<v Speaker 5>You guys drunk.</v>

5274
02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.691
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>

5275
02:20:34.691 --> 02:20:35.350
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5276
02:20:35.350 --> 02:20:39.100
<v Speaker 5>we were hired to go down there to provide protection for something.</v>

5277
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.943
<v Speaker 5>I'm just kidding.</v>

5278
02:20:40.600 --> 02:20:41.433
<v Speaker 5>What was it?</v>

5279
02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:44.710
<v Speaker 5>Oh dog dog when he was fighting.</v>

5280
02:20:44.740 --> 02:20:45.190
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5281
02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:46.960
<v Speaker 5>2007.</v>

5282
02:20:46.990 --> 02:20:51.130
<v Speaker 5>Eight dog was a fucking interesting little scenario,</v>

5283
02:20:51.131 --> 02:20:51.640
<v Speaker 5>wasn't it?</v>

5284
02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:52.210
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>

5285
02:20:52.210 --> 02:20:52.600
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

5286
02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:56.500
<v Speaker 5>I actually really liked watching it because their production in terms of,</v>

5287
02:20:56.940 --> 02:20:57.773
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5288
02:20:58.390 --> 02:21:00.450
<v Speaker 5>setting up each individual fight.</v>

5289
02:21:00.470 --> 02:21:00.551
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5290
02:21:00.551 --> 02:21:01.001
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

5291
02:21:01.001 --> 02:21:06.001
<v Speaker 5>which is funny because my buddy Clint doll did this thing called venom way back</v>

5292
02:21:06.341 --> 02:21:09.130
<v Speaker 5>in the day and it was not legal in California.</v>

5293
02:21:09.131 --> 02:21:10.900
<v Speaker 5>So what they did is they rented out a soundstage.</v>

5294
02:21:10.930 --> 02:21:11.680
<v Speaker 5>I was there.</v>

5295
02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:12.300
<v Speaker 5>You were at Vienna?</v>

5296
02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:13.133
<v Speaker 5>I was at venom.</v>

5297
02:21:13.230 --> 02:21:14.063
<v Speaker 5>So you remember them?</v>

5298
02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:14.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5299
02:21:14.890 --> 02:21:15.420
<v Speaker 5>Tell us.</v>

5300
02:21:15.420 --> 02:21:19.390
<v Speaker 5>It explained the whole soundstage and he hires John,</v>

5301
02:21:19.391 --> 02:21:23.170
<v Speaker 5>Sally and Steven Quadros to be the announcers.</v>

5302
02:21:23.620 --> 02:21:28.300
<v Speaker 5>He's got all these fights set up that they're all going to film in one or two</v>

5303
02:21:28.301 --> 02:21:33.190
<v Speaker 5>days and then they're going to prepackage it to go to sell it elsewhere.</v>

5304
02:21:33.340 --> 02:21:35.620
<v Speaker 5>He set up roving cams,</v>

5305
02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:36.670
<v Speaker 5>hard Cam's,</v>

5306
02:21:36.671 --> 02:21:37.840
<v Speaker 5>he set up all this stuff.</v>

5307
02:21:37.900 --> 02:21:41.260
<v Speaker 5>He had all these people just show up as extra to just stand around.</v>

5308
02:21:41.261 --> 02:21:43.000
<v Speaker 5>Which I guess you were there hanging out too.</v>

5309
02:21:43.001 --> 02:21:44.860
<v Speaker 5>They ordered pizzas for people to eat if the,</v>

5310
02:21:44.861 --> 02:21:45.694
<v Speaker 5>at one point,</v>

5311
02:21:46.270 --> 02:21:48.970
<v Speaker 5>and they call this thing a production,</v>

5312
02:21:48.971 --> 02:21:49.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5313
02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:51.040
<v Speaker 5>in terms of a film,</v>

5314
02:21:51.370 --> 02:21:51.880
<v Speaker 5>it's a film.</v>

5315
02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:52.713
<v Speaker 5>It's a movie.</v>

5316
02:21:52.780 --> 02:21:53.950
<v Speaker 5>So he had these people fight,</v>

5317
02:21:54.160 --> 02:21:55.870
<v Speaker 5>pretending that it was like acting.</v>

5318
02:21:55.930 --> 02:21:56.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5319
02:21:56.260 --> 02:21:58.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean while they were fighting for real.</v>

5320
02:21:58.150 --> 02:21:58.481
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5321
02:21:58.481 --> 02:21:59.560
<v Speaker 5>But they just had it,</v>

5322
02:22:00.010 --> 02:22:00.341
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

5323
02:22:00.341 --> 02:22:03.610
<v Speaker 5>it's acting sparring as actors or something.</v>

5324
02:22:04.090 --> 02:22:06.910
<v Speaker 5>They tried some wacky loophole and it worked.</v>

5325
02:22:06.970 --> 02:22:08.980
<v Speaker 5>And so did they get in trouble though?</v>

5326
02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:09.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

5327
02:22:09.971 --> 02:22:11.530
<v Speaker 5>It's just that it never went anywhere.</v>

5328
02:22:11.710 --> 02:22:12.461
<v Speaker 5>To my understanding,</v>

5329
02:22:12.461 --> 02:22:17.461
<v Speaker 5>Sally was supposed to get it to the Fox people and I don't know what happened</v>

5330
02:22:17.651 --> 02:22:18.220
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

5331
02:22:18.220 --> 02:22:18.641
<v Speaker 5>It never,</v>

5332
02:22:18.641 --> 02:22:20.680
<v Speaker 5>it never took off either way.</v>

5333
02:22:20.980 --> 02:22:21.431
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

5334
02:22:21.431 --> 02:22:25.560
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people got their start there and nobody even knows it to.</v>

5335
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:26.813
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

5336
02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:29.670
<v Speaker 5>what they did is the way they filmed all the fighters,</v>

5337
02:22:29.700 --> 02:22:31.410
<v Speaker 5>they had all of their bio's,</v>

5338
02:22:31.411 --> 02:22:33.510
<v Speaker 5>these backstories they had Mike,</v>

5339
02:22:33.570 --> 02:22:33.961
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5340
02:22:33.961 --> 02:22:34.681
<v Speaker 5>what's his face?</v>

5341
02:22:34.681 --> 02:22:39.681
<v Speaker 5>Mike seal from New Mexico who was a bank robber in Mexico and he got in trouble</v>

5342
02:22:40.501 --> 02:22:41.970
<v Speaker 5>for that and came Amy.</v>

5343
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:43.920
<v Speaker 5>So there's all these stories about these guys.</v>

5344
02:22:44.190 --> 02:22:47.040
<v Speaker 5>And so how Bodog got a hold.</v>

5345
02:22:47.250 --> 02:22:51.570
<v Speaker 5>They use the same format partially because one of the duties it was pro</v>

5346
02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:56.340
<v Speaker 5>producing Bodog have venom from way back in the day and basically just took the</v>

5347
02:22:56.341 --> 02:23:00.140
<v Speaker 5>whole concept of how they would produce it and use it for Botox.</v>

5348
02:23:00.400 --> 02:23:03.420
<v Speaker 5>Would they would put on fights on the beach and close to regrow loans,</v>

5349
02:23:03.421 --> 02:23:05.730
<v Speaker 5>hot chicks around best ring girls.</v>

5350
02:23:05.731 --> 02:23:06.550
<v Speaker 5>Just about everyone.</v>

5351
02:23:06.550 --> 02:23:08.740
<v Speaker 5>My God is that paper view.</v>

5352
02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:09.600
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember.</v>

5353
02:23:09.601 --> 02:23:11.630
<v Speaker 5>I remember watching on TV,</v>

5354
02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:12.460
<v Speaker 5>it was on TV,</v>

5355
02:23:12.460 --> 02:23:14.250
<v Speaker 5>so they shot it as a TV product.</v>

5356
02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:18.270
<v Speaker 5>They would shoot all these fights over four days and then they would chop it up</v>

5357
02:23:18.271 --> 02:23:20.510
<v Speaker 5>and the TV episodes and uh,</v>

5358
02:23:21.230 --> 02:23:21.620
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

5359
02:23:21.620 --> 02:23:24.120
<v Speaker 5>it looked really fucking cool because they just run out of money.</v>

5360
02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:25.740
<v Speaker 5>They basically,</v>

5361
02:23:25.741 --> 02:23:25.980
<v Speaker 5>the Ph,</v>

5362
02:23:25.980 --> 02:23:30.600
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot of people involved in Bodog that were basically just robbing the</v>

5363
02:23:30.601 --> 02:23:31.860
<v Speaker 5>coffers while the king sleeps.</v>

5364
02:23:31.861 --> 02:23:34.950
<v Speaker 5>They were just running it dry thinking it was just going to be a failure who</v>

5365
02:23:35.010 --> 02:23:38.370
<v Speaker 5>just get all you can while you can and just fuck it over.</v>

5366
02:23:38.371 --> 02:23:38.940
<v Speaker 5>And they did.</v>

5367
02:23:38.940 --> 02:23:40.710
<v Speaker 5>They used to do those billboards,</v>

5368
02:23:41.070 --> 02:23:41.551
<v Speaker 5>Calvin,</v>

5369
02:23:41.551 --> 02:23:45.870
<v Speaker 5>I or presents Bodog so it'd be handled dog fights like on a throne.</v>

5370
02:23:45.900 --> 02:23:49.020
<v Speaker 5>It'd be him with like a beautiful suit on his face.</v>

5371
02:23:49.021 --> 02:23:51.570
<v Speaker 5>Like nobody's buying the fights to look at you.</v>

5372
02:23:51.850 --> 02:23:52.651
<v Speaker 5>You didn't make any sense.</v>

5373
02:23:52.651 --> 02:23:53.490
<v Speaker 5>It was such a vanity.</v>

5374
02:23:53.491 --> 02:23:53.851
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

5375
02:23:53.851 --> 02:23:54.090
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

5376
02:23:54.090 --> 02:23:55.980
<v Speaker 5>it was definitely retarded in that way.</v>

5377
02:23:55.981 --> 02:23:56.814
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

5378
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:58.380
<v Speaker 5>but I have really was down there.</v>

5379
02:23:58.381 --> 02:24:02.280
<v Speaker 5>He fought a Mario Renaldi knocked them out with and ride out with an overhand</v>

5380
02:24:02.281 --> 02:24:02.431
<v Speaker 5>rule.</v>

5381
02:24:02.431 --> 02:24:03.390
<v Speaker 5>He always could punch.</v>

5382
02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:04.710
<v Speaker 5>I just don't think he was training it.</v>

5383
02:24:05.550 --> 02:24:05.931
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5384
02:24:05.931 --> 02:24:06.764
<v Speaker 5>according to him,</v>

5385
02:24:06.930 --> 02:24:08.880
<v Speaker 5>I don't buy that list.</v>

5386
02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.490
<v Speaker 5>He also used to weigh like two 20,</v>

5387
02:24:11.491 --> 02:24:12.324
<v Speaker 5>two 15.</v>

5388
02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:12.770
<v Speaker 5>Anything.</v>

5389
02:24:12.770 --> 02:24:13.603
<v Speaker 5>Frank Mir and uh,</v>

5390
02:24:13.650 --> 02:24:14.610
<v Speaker 5>grappling contest.</v>

5391
02:24:14.670 --> 02:24:15.330
<v Speaker 5>Remember that?</v>

5392
02:24:15.330 --> 02:24:15.451
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5393
02:24:15.451 --> 02:24:15.781
<v Speaker 5>What did it,</v>

5394
02:24:15.781 --> 02:24:17.970
<v Speaker 5>what happened was he from near was all over him.</v>

5395
02:24:17.971 --> 02:24:19.110
<v Speaker 5>Like fucking white on rice,</v>

5396
02:24:19.250 --> 02:24:21.960
<v Speaker 5>got tired and then Roy just outscored them.</v>

5397
02:24:22.290 --> 02:24:22.921
<v Speaker 5>But what happened?</v>

5398
02:24:22.921 --> 02:24:23.250
<v Speaker 5>Why did it,</v>

5399
02:24:23.250 --> 02:24:23.640
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

5400
02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:27.690
<v Speaker 5>what did Roy do that made them gain all that weight and keep it on while he's</v>

5401
02:24:27.691 --> 02:24:28.470
<v Speaker 5>getting in shape?</v>

5402
02:24:28.470 --> 02:24:29.400
<v Speaker 5>That's what I don't understand.</v>

5403
02:24:29.401 --> 02:24:29.701
<v Speaker 5>I don't think,</v>

5404
02:24:29.701 --> 02:24:30.810
<v Speaker 5>it's not what he did.</v>

5405
02:24:30.811 --> 02:24:32.100
<v Speaker 5>It's what he never stopped doing.</v>

5406
02:24:32.101 --> 02:24:32.610
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5407
02:24:32.610 --> 02:24:33.443
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

5408
02:24:33.690 --> 02:24:36.540
<v Speaker 5>I just don't know how you could be in good enough shape.</v>

5409
02:24:36.810 --> 02:24:40.770
<v Speaker 5>We can go three hard five minute rounds and not lose that gut.</v>

5410
02:24:41.430 --> 02:24:41.970
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno,</v>

5411
02:24:41.970 --> 02:24:43.200
<v Speaker 5>you had a fuel that God,</v>

5412
02:24:43.201 --> 02:24:44.070
<v Speaker 5>that God has got to be.</v>

5413
02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:46.170
<v Speaker 5>He said he's working on that thing there.</v>

5414
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:51.230
<v Speaker 5>Maybe there's a little tape forms in there and use an engine inside that just</v>

5415
02:24:51.241 --> 02:24:51.931
<v Speaker 5>keeps them going.</v>

5416
02:24:51.931 --> 02:24:52.051
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5417
02:24:52.051 --> 02:24:52.920
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of padding.</v>

5418
02:24:52.921 --> 02:24:54.060
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you that c eight,</v>

5419
02:24:54.061 --> 02:24:56.040
<v Speaker 5>those fucking Alistair Overeem potty kicks.</v>

5420
02:24:56.041 --> 02:24:57.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't even think that pattern can make that big.</v>

5421
02:24:57.980 --> 02:24:58.350
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

5422
02:24:58.350 --> 02:25:02.180
<v Speaker 5>That's just being strong and tough shit.</v>

5423
02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:03.113
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5424
02:25:03.210 --> 02:25:04.110
<v Speaker 5>Well that'll be a good fight,</v>

5425
02:25:04.111 --> 02:25:04.440
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

5426
02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:05.460
<v Speaker 5>I would like to see that fight.</v>

5427
02:25:05.690 --> 02:25:06.360
<v Speaker 5>I you still do.</v>

5428
02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:08.490
<v Speaker 5>I think it'll be entertaining if it'll actually happen yet.</v>

5429
02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:09.120
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

5430
02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:09.960
