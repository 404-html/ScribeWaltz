67
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 1>As time goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As he's looking at me,</v>

68
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>he's going to have a few comments that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just getting my God dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just looking at me.</v>

70
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

71
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Look at people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

72
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.030
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know the effect it has on</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>

73
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.820
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck do you go from being a rock</v>
<v Speaker 1>star to being a rock star slash wine</v>

74
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.840
<v Speaker 1>maker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the,</v>

75
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:53.120
<v Speaker 1>it was just a whim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you have this idea?</v>

76
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.720
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest hurdle there you have to get</v>

77
00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 1>over is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever really been a</v>

78
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually dabbled in the rock star</v>

79
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:01.624
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

80
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.823
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

81
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.810
<v Speaker 3>Allah American psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

82
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.780
<v Speaker 3>for the most part it was just kind of me</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting it on.</v>

83
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.700
<v Speaker 3>I've always kind of been a small town</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid,</v>

84
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>working in the garden.</v>

85
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.890
<v Speaker 1>So you think of yourself as just a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being who likes to do things that are</v>

86
00:03:15.891 --> 00:03:17.450
<v Speaker 1>interesting and this is what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to you.</v>

87
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done things over the years and just</v>

88
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get inspired and do more things and then</v>

89
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 3>all sudden accidentally over along the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way somewhere you,</v>

90
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 3>you make a few dollars on something and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just go home,</v>

91
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I can do more stuff.</v>

92
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.890
<v Speaker 1>But even the way you did this is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>uniquely you,</v>

93
00:03:33.891 --> 00:03:34.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't,</v>

94
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.480
<v Speaker 1>you didn't do it in Sonoma county.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't take an established orchard</v>

95
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.960
<v Speaker 1>orchard rather than in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:03:39.961 --> 00:03:41.210
<v Speaker 1>and take over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

97
00:03:41.211 --> 00:03:44.060
<v Speaker 1>you went to a weird place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went to fucking Arizona.</v>

98
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think of Arizona,</v>

99
00:03:45.471 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>you think of kidnappings and in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

100
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.440
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think of Nice tea.</v>

101
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think of wine vineyards.</v>

102
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

103
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.580
<v Speaker 1>a historic</v>

104
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.413
<v Speaker 3>glee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost,</v>

105
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.390
<v Speaker 3>almost every state that could actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>sustain grapes,</v>

106
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vinifera.</v>

107
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.660
<v Speaker 3>So European grapes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost every state had vineyards and</v>

108
00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:09.390
<v Speaker 3>Haley and prohibition just threw a</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrench,</v>

109
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.310
<v Speaker 3>stuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>told him monkey wrench in that.</v>

110
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.950
<v Speaker 3>And we can go down the whole conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 3>theory regarding,</v>

111
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

112
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>prohibition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

113
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful one.</v>

114
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

115
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.250
<v Speaker 1>It's still working today with marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

116
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 1>And same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same people.</v>

117
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.833
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

118
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.260
<v Speaker 3>so that pretty much what that did is it</v>
<v Speaker 3>just interrupted our appreciation for</v>

119
00:04:27.261 --> 00:04:27.330
<v Speaker 3>what</v>

120
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.140
<v Speaker 1>wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

121
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.240
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a daily part in Europe.</v>

122
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:33.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's why European wines became so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more popular than American wines.</v>

123
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

124
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.820
<v Speaker 1>but they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have</v>

125
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.640
<v Speaker 3>some places in Europe have had thousands</v>
<v Speaker 3>of years to develop what's going on on</v>

126
00:04:40.641 --> 00:04:42.590
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that particular spot.</v>

127
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.390
<v Speaker 3>They've had like just decades and</v>
<v Speaker 3>centuries of notes,</v>

128
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether on the terrain,</v>

129
00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:51.110
<v Speaker 3>on the results,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the process.</v>

130
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.860
<v Speaker 3>So they're so far ahead of us in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of just understanding those things and</v>

131
00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:55.940
<v Speaker 3>it's part of their culture.</v>

132
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.580
<v Speaker 1>It's the ground and the soil and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>minerals and story with people who have</v>

133
00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:04.110
<v Speaker 1>not had any experience with farming</v>
<v Speaker 1>might not know,</v>

134
00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:06.510
<v Speaker 1>but they vary wildly from place to</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

135
00:05:06.511 --> 00:05:10.710
<v Speaker 1>How do you find the right spot if it</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't had a vineyard there before?</v>

136
00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Or do you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a good spot?</v>

137
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Let's you know,</v>

138
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.980
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you join the military,</v>

139
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.180
<v Speaker 3>you get out of the military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you form a band,</v>

140
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>take $1 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go dump that million dollars into a</v>

141
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>fucking black hole in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere and then go,</v>

142
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:31.720
<v Speaker 1>well that was the wrong hole and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>move over here and you're digging</v>

143
00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:33.520
<v Speaker 1>another hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many times did you do?</v>

144
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

145
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>she did a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

146
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just our working what we've tried.</v>

147
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's basically it to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

148
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 1>get a printer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can actually print money that looks</v>

149
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 1>real and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure you keep changing the</v>

150
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>cartridges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did you have to buy new land</v>

151
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.110
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up,</v>

152
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you just have to pick the right</v>

153
00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 1>variety for that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're pretty,</v>

154
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>if you have</v>

155
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.620
<v Speaker 3>a pretty good idea that an area</v>
<v Speaker 3>consisting good grapes there that are</v>

156
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.463
<v Speaker 3>going to make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

157
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of wine you want to drink,</v>

158
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's a matter of figuring out what</v>

159
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 3>varietals going to work best there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

160
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 3>we're not trying to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not trying to grow wine and grow</v>

161
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 3>grapes in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Alaska.</v>

162
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to really hard</v>

163
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 3>pressed to find the right volume that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alicia grow their,</v>

164
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.961
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

165
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 3>we have Canadian ice wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have like a lot of the American</v>

166
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 3>hybrids to like vet all Blanca and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Norton and knows kind of grapes that</v>

167
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 3>will grow in that extreme cold</v>
<v Speaker 3>temperatures.</v>

168
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a lot of daylight.</v>

169
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

170
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 3>it really ripe in the Vinifera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in our area we have everything is</v>

171
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 3>that everything's there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's set up.</v>

172
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 3>So it's just a matter of finding in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular location that you dumped all</v>

173
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 3>your money into this land.</v>

174
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.920
<v Speaker 3>Like it figured out what grows there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to be,</v>

175
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 3>it's probably not going to be what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>think is going to grow.</v>

176
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be something else and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to take a lot of trial and</v>

177
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 3>error and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$40,000 an acre to find out.</v>

178
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 3>So you have to try different grapes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then go through a full season and then</v>

179
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:02.520
<v Speaker 3>test the results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

180
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

181
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 3>it's more like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more like just looking at the soil</v>

182
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that and that particular terrain and</v>

183
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:11.090
<v Speaker 3>where it is and how it's oriented north,</v>
<v Speaker 3>south,</v>

184
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 3>east,</v>
<v Speaker 3>west and then try to pick the right</v>

185
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 3>grape for that site before you put</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything on the ground,</v>

186
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 3>figure out what great might work there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this is a natural resource process</v>

187
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it something that you knew about</v>

188
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 3>already?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you were interested in it or did</v>

189
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 3>you have to learn all this as you went</v>
<v Speaker 3>along and had to learn?</v>

190
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 3>I learned the hard way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know when you put the vine in the</v>

191
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:33.740
<v Speaker 3>ground you don't know for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you might,</v>

192
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 3>if it comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

193
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.540
<v Speaker 3>if it sticks around the next year</v>
<v Speaker 3>within,</v>

194
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 3>you know you're at least you've got that</v>
<v Speaker 3>part,</v>

195
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.980
<v Speaker 3>then you know I'd actually grew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you've got to figure it up.</v>

196
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 3>It's going to get the point where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can actually train it to start,</v>

197
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>setting fruit on it.</v>

198
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 3>So you're not going to see fruit on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>vine.</v>

199
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 3>You can probably push it and get some</v>
<v Speaker 3>fruit on there the third year.</v>

200
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:54.500
<v Speaker 3>But if you really want quality fruit and</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to just let the plant really</v>

201
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 3>sinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find its way,</v>

202
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 3>get the root system to get the whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of it a happy and healthy and</v>

203
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 3>then set fruit on it on the fourth year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you make the wine out of that</v>

204
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 3>fruit in the fourth year and then get to</v>
<v Speaker 3>try it like in its fifth year.</v>

205
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 3>So five years down the road after having</v>
<v Speaker 3>planted those vines,</v>

206
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:11.930
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

207
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 3>that wine sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man,</v>

208
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.140
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

209
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.790
<v Speaker 3>And there's no other way you can do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

210
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:24.740
<v Speaker 3>There's no other like high tech DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not necessarily determine lens,</v>

211
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

212
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.350
<v Speaker 3>If you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have,</v>

213
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.850
<v Speaker 3>like if you're in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Napa Valley and you've got a vineyard</v>

214
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:31.880
<v Speaker 3>over here and a vineyard over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chances are the vineyard right here in</v>

215
00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:34.880
<v Speaker 3>the middle is probably going to do okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you'll know what to grow by,</v>

216
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.830
<v Speaker 3>what everyone around you is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a history,</v>

217
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 3>but we have no history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

218
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're guessing you're,</v>

219
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.090
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're finding now through trial and</v>

220
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:45.740
<v Speaker 3>error and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

221
00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:48.800
<v Speaker 3>many dollars later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're finding that the Italian and</v>

222
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Spanish and varietals and southern Rhone</v>
<v Speaker 3>varietals are doing pretty well.</v>

223
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.680
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the motivation to do this in</v>

224
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:55.514
<v Speaker 3>such,</v>

225
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

226
00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning manner,</v>

227
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:00.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

228
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.030
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went at it about as his most</v>

229
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>difficult path as possible to creating a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wa to creating a wine.</v>

230
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.750
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

231
00:09:08.751 --> 00:09:12.320
<v Speaker 4>it was where I lived and just having</v>
<v Speaker 4>traveled around the world,</v>

232
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:17.210
<v Speaker 4>seeing other regions that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>resembled those regions and uh,</v>

233
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:18.523
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Kinda,</v>

234
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm the on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

235
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.350
<v Speaker 4>the contrarian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

236
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.540
<v Speaker 4>say one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go the other way just to</v>

237
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.810
<v Speaker 4>balance things out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just looking at that place,</v>

238
00:09:26.811 --> 00:09:28.580
<v Speaker 4>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

239
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.030
<v Speaker 4>I have an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're looking off your back porch.</v>

240
00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:33.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

241
00:09:33.081 --> 00:09:33.914
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

242
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this sounds like a,</v>

243
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.510
<v Speaker 4>I want to try this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause how many other vineyards are in</v>

244
00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:39.860
<v Speaker 4>Arizona?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

245
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.110
<v Speaker 4>well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are now,</v>

246
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.430
<v Speaker 4>when I first started there was about 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe 18 bonded wineries.</v>

247
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.170
<v Speaker 4>Now there's about 50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

248
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.480
<v Speaker 1>You model yourself after them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would look at like what soil they're</v>

249
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.140
<v Speaker 1>using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's similar to yours.</v>

250
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Did you have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

251
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.300
<v Speaker 1>anything to go on?</v>

252
00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.480
<v Speaker 4>Not really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

253
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a guy from a UC Davis come out and</v>

254
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.370
<v Speaker 4>kind of chase his tail a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at it and go,</v>

255
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.710
<v Speaker 4>luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

256
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.780
<v Speaker 4>do you have to treat the soil in any</v>
<v Speaker 4>way?</v>

257
00:10:07.781 --> 00:10:10.750
<v Speaker 4>Do you have to mulch it or not</v>
<v Speaker 4>necessarily you and you have to make</v>

258
00:10:10.751 --> 00:10:12.910
<v Speaker 4>some soil adjustments if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if really needed.</v>

259
00:10:12.911 --> 00:10:14.200
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a perfect world,</v>

260
00:10:14.201 --> 00:10:16.690
<v Speaker 4>you don't do any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just let it be what it's going to be.</v>

261
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.580
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you want to really express that</v>

262
00:10:18.581 --> 00:10:21.730
<v Speaker 4>place as much as you can and you want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

263
00:10:21.731 --> 00:10:23.060
<v Speaker 4>you want to help,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

264
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 4>the mines along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there,</v>

265
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.590
<v Speaker 4>if there is some nutrient deficiencies</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you go,</v>

266
00:10:26.591 --> 00:10:29.020
<v Speaker 4>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll notice right away in the vines,</v>

267
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.430
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're paying attention,</v>

268
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.140
<v Speaker 4>but you can also test for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

269
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.170
<v Speaker 4>they did little petioles tat and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ends of the vine,</v>

270
00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.540
<v Speaker 4>you'd send a man who just see what's in</v>
<v Speaker 4>them and what's not in them.</v>

271
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:42.040
<v Speaker 4>So there'll be able to tell you roughly</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of a wine it'll produce.</v>

272
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.110
<v Speaker 4>A No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll just let you know whether the</v>

273
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.780
<v Speaker 4>plant is healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

274
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.640
<v Speaker 4>so what needs nutrients?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

275
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.480
<v Speaker 4>whether or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we could plant,</v>

276
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.381
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

277
00:10:50.381 --> 00:10:54.640
<v Speaker 4>we can plan American hybrids there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll do great thrive look,</v>

278
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.890
<v Speaker 4>look awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the wine's crap.</v>

279
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:57.923
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

280
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wine made out of Norton this,</v>

281
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:04.240
<v Speaker 4>it's very rare that you have somebody</v>
<v Speaker 4>who will impress you with a glass of</v>

282
00:11:04.241 --> 00:11:06.280
<v Speaker 4>Norton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what Norton is.</v>

283
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.070
<v Speaker 4>Manischewitz it's equivalent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first time I ever heard about an</v>

284
00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:14.470
<v Speaker 4>area making things taste differently</v>
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

285
00:11:14.471 --> 00:11:16.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend who was really in Cuban</v>

286
00:11:16.211 --> 00:11:17.460
<v Speaker 4>cigars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tommy,</v>

287
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.440
<v Speaker 4>you have this Vl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

288
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.960
<v Speaker 4>I forget what the name of this one area</v>
<v Speaker 4>of tube is,</v>

289
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.930
<v Speaker 4>but it's a small area,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

290
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.160
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a few hundred acres or something</v>

291
00:11:27.161 --> 00:11:27.490
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

292
00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.100
<v Speaker 4>And in that few hundred acres,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they produce all the worlds,</v>

293
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.670
<v Speaker 4>Cuban cigars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's just whatever's in that soil,</v>

294
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.410
<v Speaker 4>just making it up that much about</v>
<v Speaker 4>cigars.</v>

295
00:11:35.411 --> 00:11:37.270
<v Speaker 4>But I know I've had people hand me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

296
00:11:37.271 --> 00:11:39.700
<v Speaker 4>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's three different cigars,</v>

297
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.620
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that have the little thing.</v>

298
00:11:41.621 --> 00:11:45.460
<v Speaker 4>He repped off it and try them out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know who I liked that one Cuban.</v>

299
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.970
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing how strong they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

300
00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:50.470
<v Speaker 4>Like what it actually does to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's a fucking drug.</v>

301
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.550
<v Speaker 4>Like if you have a good solid cigar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

302
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.351
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

303
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:55.520
<v Speaker 4>like I'm high right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a real,</v>

304
00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.750
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get motivated to do things.</v>

305
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.490
<v Speaker 4>We had a guy in here yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rob Wolf was a nutritionist.</v>

306
00:12:01.491 --> 00:12:02.530
<v Speaker 4>She was telling us that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

307
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.640
<v Speaker 4>creativity is enhanced by nicotine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gum,</v>

308
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 4>nicotine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually not bad for you.</v>

309
00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:08.380
<v Speaker 4>It's bad for you is all the shit that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>in cigarettes.</v>

310
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.570
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the nicotine itself actually,</v>

311
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so a positive drug,</v>

312
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.860
<v Speaker 4>just hard for us to wrap our heads</v>
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

313
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:15.850
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

314
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:16.850
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

315
00:12:16.851 --> 00:12:21.070
<v Speaker 4>you found this spot and how many years</v>
<v Speaker 4>did it take you to you producing what</v>

316
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:23.050
<v Speaker 4>you have here today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have two wines here today.</v>

317
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

318
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.353
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

319
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.210
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

320
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 4>the rosacea that I brought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the Lelea Nebbiolo Rosé.</v>

321
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.010
<v Speaker 4>This is from our southern Arizona</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vineyard that we actually purchased.</v>

322
00:12:32.011 --> 00:12:33.700
<v Speaker 4>It was an existing vineyard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

323
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.980
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

324
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Graham County area.</v>

325
00:12:36.341 --> 00:12:39.160
<v Speaker 4>It's called Bonita springs been here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I've been,</v>

326
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:39.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with my,</v>

327
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.620
<v Speaker 4>cause I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well three,</v>

328
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.230
<v Speaker 4>three wineries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a caduceus and American vineyards or are</v>

329
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.170
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my label,</v>

330
00:12:47.171 --> 00:12:50.590
<v Speaker 4>I make these wines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then Arizona stronghold is my sister</v>

331
00:12:50.591 --> 00:12:53.440
<v Speaker 4>company and I'm an investor and Co</v>
<v Speaker 4>founder of that company.</v>

332
00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:56.810
<v Speaker 4>And that company bought these two</v>
<v Speaker 4>existing vineyards.</v>

333
00:12:56.811 --> 00:12:57.700
<v Speaker 4>Dennis Southern Arizona.</v>

334
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.600
<v Speaker 4>So there's the Arizona strong open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your coachees county out and Wilcox and</v>

335
00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:03.370
<v Speaker 4>then the Benita springs vineyard in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Graham County.</v>

336
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:07.000
<v Speaker 4>So this is most of your focus right now</v>
<v Speaker 4>is making wine.</v>

337
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.270
<v Speaker 4>When do you just very well when it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to harvest time,</v>

338
00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:11.470
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where I have to be.</v>

339
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.510
<v Speaker 4>Cause there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no other way around it.</v>

340
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.270
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

341
00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife runs the lab and I make the</v>

342
00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:18.910
<v Speaker 4>wine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when it's harvest time,</v>

343
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Monday,</v>

344
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 4>so starting Monday you gather up the</v>
<v Speaker 4>grapes and then start the process of</v>

345
00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:28.440
<v Speaker 4>turning them into wine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a,</v>

346
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.171
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll,</v>

347
00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:30.460
<v Speaker 4>it'll go on through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

348
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.900
<v Speaker 4>we'll see our first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

349
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.050
<v Speaker 4>we'll see our first white's probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>around the first week of August.</v>

350
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.250
<v Speaker 4>So I had to basically be back there to</v>
<v Speaker 4>just get ready and getting everything</v>

351
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:40.660
<v Speaker 4>ready.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the process,</v>

352
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.800
<v Speaker 4>the fermentation process?</v>

353
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.990
<v Speaker 4>I know you gather up the wine or you</v>
<v Speaker 4>gather up the grapes,</v>

354
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:45.970
<v Speaker 4>rather you smash them and then what</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens?</v>

355
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.983
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it depends on,</v>

356
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.760
<v Speaker 4>depends on how you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how you do it.</v>

357
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 4>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some people that,</v>

358
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do the harvest,</v>

359
00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:54.640
<v Speaker 4>you bring them in and you actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>destem the grapes.</v>

360
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.790
<v Speaker 4>You put him into December and it's kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of like a big tumbler and the grapes</v>

361
00:13:57.791 --> 00:14:00.300
<v Speaker 4>fall through these holes and these</v>
<v Speaker 4>little paddles and knock the stems out</v>

362
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 4>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they'll fall into either a</v>

363
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 4>crusher that just kind of pop them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>puts them into the bin.</v>

364
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:10.510
<v Speaker 4>And you now they're pumped them into a</v>
<v Speaker 4>tank or you put them in a bin and your</v>

365
00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:12.580
<v Speaker 4>friend in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or has it just stemmed,</v>

366
00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:15.450
<v Speaker 4>you just leave them whole berry and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's carbonic masturbation.</v>

367
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.860
<v Speaker 4>And so that's more like a peanut Anwar</v>
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>

368
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.830
<v Speaker 4>So the produce different results,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether they have a stem or not.</v>

369
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.720
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think personally it might,</v>

370
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.610
<v Speaker 4>my choices,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do all my wines,</v>

371
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.490
<v Speaker 4>all the reds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do them a carbonic masturbation with</v>

372
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:28.750
<v Speaker 4>the whole berry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

373
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.870
<v Speaker 4>cause I feel like just in the results</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you crush him,</v>

374
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.280
<v Speaker 4>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>depending on the region,</v>

375
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

376
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.390
<v Speaker 4>the skins and the stems and the seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

377
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seeds and the seeds and skins mainly</v>

378
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.120
<v Speaker 4>when you crush them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we actually have more exposure to those</v>

379
00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:45.610
<v Speaker 4>kind of like negative tannins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of like a green,</v>

380
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.650
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tannins and bitter that don't quite,</v>

381
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't necessarily precipitate out.</v>

382
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.990
<v Speaker 4>How did you get involved in all this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this something you've always been</v>

383
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:58.670
<v Speaker 4>fascinated with or did you just one day</v>
<v Speaker 4>get into it and never looked back?</v>

384
00:14:59.020 --> 00:14:59.691
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

385
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:01.130
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

386
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:01.841
<v Speaker 4>I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

387
00:15:01.841 --> 00:15:05.130
<v Speaker 4>working in fruit orchards and my dad had</v>
<v Speaker 4>a garden and uh,</v>

388
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.150
<v Speaker 4>so I think it's just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of fall into it a little bit,</v>

389
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>reluctantly back then.</v>

390
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 4>Of course you hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to weed,</v>

391
00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 4>you know what to look for the cut or if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to like do all that</v>

392
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:16.300
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then when you look back on you</v>

393
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.160
<v Speaker 4>actually that was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was pretty cool.</v>

394
00:15:18.161 --> 00:15:19.810
<v Speaker 4>It's hands on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

395
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.770
<v Speaker 4>when you see what's the food on your</v>
<v Speaker 4>table,</v>

396
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a teenager you don't get it,</v>

397

<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's sweet.</v>

407
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.940
<v Speaker 4>Bears are moving into Detroit.</v>

408
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.920
<v Speaker 4>So can we try some of this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

409
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes to smell it.</v>

410
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.580
<v Speaker 4>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can try it here.</v>

411
00:15:58.581 --> 00:15:59.900
<v Speaker 4>I'll call you one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

412
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:02.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you still do a lot of art?</v>

413
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.930
<v Speaker 4>Because I knew you went to college for</v>
<v Speaker 4>art and a lot of your,</v>

414
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.950
<v Speaker 4>your videos are very art based.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

415
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.570
<v Speaker 4>do you personally do any arts still or</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

416
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.710
<v Speaker 4>or were you really ever into doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was more like the director or</v>

417
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.680
<v Speaker 4>producer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

418
00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.020
<v Speaker 4>I was kind of into the coordinating of</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting artists in a room to do things.</v>

419
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:21.470
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

420
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.750
<v Speaker 4>as far as the actual talent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

421
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.880
<v Speaker 4>I can't play piano.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't play guitar.</v>

422
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 4>I can barely draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did you become the lead singer of a</v>

423
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:34.070
<v Speaker 4>band then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Accidentally I was the loudest asshole</v>

424
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:35.870
<v Speaker 4>in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were the most bold.</v>

425
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.960
<v Speaker 4>That was a guy who thought I had</v>
<v Speaker 4>something to say.</v>

426
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:40.221
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

427
00:16:40.221 --> 00:16:41.180
<v Speaker 4>Doug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your music man.</v>

428
00:16:41.181 --> 00:16:44.210
<v Speaker 4>But of course like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I really became a fan when I read</v>

429
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:45.920
<v Speaker 4>this piece that you wrote on Hixon</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gracie.</v>

430
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:48.110
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

431
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>

432
00:16:49.501 --> 00:16:53.580
<v Speaker 4>you just nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nailed the whole balance of the balance</v>

433
00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:55.190
<v Speaker 4>article and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

434
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.270
<v Speaker 4>And Hixon himself was a fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

435
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.020
<v Speaker 4>he's a very few people that I've met</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you,</v>

436
00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:04.070
<v Speaker 4>you meet him and like right away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

437
00:17:04.071 --> 00:17:05.630
<v Speaker 4>there's something different about this</v>
<v Speaker 4>cat.</v>

438
00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.930
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hixon is incredibly intense guy.</v>

439
00:17:08.931 --> 00:17:12.230
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so rare you find a real martial</v>

440
00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:16.370
<v Speaker 4>arts master.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So sort of a cliche term that we,</v>

441
00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:16.851
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

442
00:17:16.851 --> 00:17:17.860
<v Speaker 4>we think of an,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

443
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.100
<v Speaker 4>terms of like movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one man who is the master who has it</v>

444
00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:23.400
<v Speaker 4>all in control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

445
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:28.160
<v Speaker 4>not to take anything away from Hixson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've actually learned more from</v>

446
00:17:28.161 --> 00:17:31.430
<v Speaker 4>training with boiler boilers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What amazing.</v>

447
00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:32.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.280
<v Speaker 4>cause we got to travel around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

450
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.660
<v Speaker 4>I can't train consistently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I can't just walk into a Dojo and</v>

451
00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:45.290
<v Speaker 4>just throw my gay and expect not to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>my ass handed to me and then not be able</v>

452
00:17:45.291 --> 00:17:46.220
<v Speaker 4>to do the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

453
00:17:46.221 --> 00:17:46.790
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

454
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:47.271
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

455
00:17:47.271 --> 00:17:48.980
<v Speaker 4>I was just do privates and I just do</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

456
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.943
<v Speaker 4>The guys who</v>

457
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.510
<v Speaker 3>are as old or older than me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they don't have anything to prove.</v>

458
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.181
<v Speaker 3>So it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

459
00:17:54.181 --> 00:17:55.800
<v Speaker 3>let's just have some fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

460
00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:57.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather than trying to put a notch in</v>

461
00:17:57.871 --> 00:17:59.250
<v Speaker 3>their belt with my blood,</v>

462
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of the older guys would do that</v>

463
00:18:03.441 --> 00:18:04.101
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

464
00:18:04.101 --> 00:18:05.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the,</v>

465
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you get to the black belt</v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

466
00:18:07.071 --> 00:18:09.320
<v Speaker 1>no one's trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very cool about it.</v>

467
00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.080
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't just walk into a room and just</v>

468
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.850
<v Speaker 3>dive into a class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

469
00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.220
<v Speaker 3>Not at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not at the age of 48 going on 50.</v>

470
00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Did you used to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you take classes</v>

471
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.710
<v Speaker 3>earlier on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's how I got injured.</v>

472
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.300
<v Speaker 3>You walk into the wrong place that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>think for some reason you're,</v>

473
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenging their manhood and all of a</v>

474
00:18:24.581 --> 00:18:25.960
<v Speaker 3>sudden it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

475
00:18:25.961 --> 00:18:28.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At that point I only weighed like one</v>

476
00:18:28.031 --> 00:18:30.640
<v Speaker 3>35.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're rolling into any,</v>

477
00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.620
<v Speaker 3>any Dojo we're rolling into a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

478
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might as well be somebody's child.</v>

479
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:39.390
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is that a blue belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purple belt stage where you're just</v>

480
00:18:39.391 --> 00:18:43.100
<v Speaker 1>trying to get as many kills as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like anyone that comes in,</v>

481
00:18:43.101 --> 00:18:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll look at this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's only 140 pounds.</v>

482
00:18:44.851 --> 00:18:46.410
<v Speaker 1>So that's a kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get this one.</v>

483
00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:47.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not ignoring you.</v>

484
00:18:47.431 --> 00:18:50.400

<v Speaker 1>can prove that I actually did that.</v>

485
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:52.483
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>an impact on martial arts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>teaching some silly form of something.</v>

508
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.340
<v Speaker 3>Had A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who was working with a</v>

509
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.560
<v Speaker 3>band and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

510
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.970
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

511
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.860
<v Speaker 3>a solid practitioner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

512
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:07.320
<v Speaker 3>finally got his black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

513
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.780
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't even,</v>

514
00:20:09.781 --> 00:20:12.810
<v Speaker 3>he did security.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's doing mainly a director of security</v>

515
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.260
<v Speaker 3>and for these different tours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this particular one,</v>

516
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't doing any martial arts.</v>

517
00:20:18.061 --> 00:20:21.000
<v Speaker 3>I've just like doing his job and</v>
<v Speaker 3>directing what was going on.</v>

518
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.590
<v Speaker 3>And then one of the artists was flying</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy in and paying them all this</v>

519
00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:29.640
<v Speaker 3>money to do this Kung Fu stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

520
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.710
<v Speaker 3>he's being respectful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just letting that like,</v>

521
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.340
<v Speaker 3>and not my place to even insert into</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

522
00:20:35.341 --> 00:20:36.390
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

523
00:20:36.391 --> 00:20:40.260
<v Speaker 3>he's would always like to angle into</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting an opportunity on the road</v>

524
00:20:40.261 --> 00:20:42.630
<v Speaker 3>because when you're traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to train and try to do this stuff</v>

525
00:20:42.631 --> 00:20:44.340
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost impossible.</v>

526
00:20:44.341 --> 00:20:45.570
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to do.</v>

527
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:46.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

528
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's any way he can work into at</v>

529
00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:52.420
<v Speaker 3>least getting to train with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be great.</v>

530
00:20:52.421 --> 00:20:53.380
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

531
00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:55.000
<v Speaker 3>whenever the opportunity presented</v>
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>

532
00:20:55.001 --> 00:20:55.421
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

533

<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it wasn't responding to him.</v>

539
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.300
<v Speaker 3>So he's like finally went,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm on my way to trips kind of</v>

586
00:22:55.321 --> 00:22:56.880
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to Chinatown.</v>

587
00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.240
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

588
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.740
<v Speaker 1>it was secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a hustle for a long time.</v>

589
00:23:00.741 --> 00:23:04.280
<v Speaker 1>All you had to do was pretend you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to like throw some techniques that</v>

590
00:23:04.281 --> 00:23:06.890
<v Speaker 1>you learned from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could watch a John Claude van</v>

591
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Damme movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of get a good idea how he's moving</v>

592
00:23:09.141 --> 00:23:12.650
<v Speaker 1>his body and sort of recreate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you are really crazy,</v>

593
00:23:12.651 --> 00:23:14.270
<v Speaker 1>next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have a school where you're</v>

594
00:23:14.271 --> 00:23:17.810
<v Speaker 1>teaching your own style of self defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's completely ineffective.</v>

595
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.120
<v Speaker 3>I want to do when it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

596
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>practical fighting where you're</v>

597
00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:22.650
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

598
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.360
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be in a bar so you might</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well be drunk.</v>

599
00:23:24.361 --> 00:23:28.170
<v Speaker 3>So we called it dear son dough and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just show up and immediately kind a six</v>

600
00:23:28.171 --> 00:23:29.004
<v Speaker 3>pack and then we start.</v>

601
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:31.560
<v Speaker 1>That's a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

602
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.680
<v Speaker 1>We've got to throw your chair away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's dead.</v>

603
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:37.580
<v Speaker 1>I think lunch you grab one of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>other ones that don't get used as much.</v>

604
00:23:37.581 --> 00:23:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Don't squeak as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

605
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was his back.</v>

606
00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:43.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but imagine if it was,</v>

607
00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:47.420
<v Speaker 1>that would be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be one of the worst feelings</v>

608
00:23:47.421 --> 00:23:49.550
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you dedicated a massive amount of</v>

609
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:53.060
<v Speaker 1>your life to some bullshit and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just exposed in front of you like that</v>

610
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.280
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens to a lot of martial artists,</v>

611
00:23:55.281 --> 00:23:56.900
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met a lot of people who,</v>

612
00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was taekwondo or whatever,</v>

613
00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:03.350
<v Speaker 1>traditional martial art that had a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>hole in it and they didn't even realize</v>

614
00:24:03.351 --> 00:24:04.171
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

615
00:24:04.171 --> 00:24:05.420
<v Speaker 1>it's the same with my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

616
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.080
<v Speaker 1>he was a black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

617
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.300
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo and he will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he rolled into a,</v>

618
00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:12.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

619
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Rodrigo Bodgie his place in Saint Louis</v>
<v Speaker 1>and went,</v>

620
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.040
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

621
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.140
<v Speaker 1>whatever this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just show you.</v>

622
00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.550
<v Speaker 1>And he just had his ass handed to him</v>
<v Speaker 1>like repeatedly.</v>

623
00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

624
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

625
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.440
<v Speaker 1>It was a black belt in taekwondo before</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever did.</v>

626
00:24:27.441 --> 00:24:29.380
<v Speaker 1>You did so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I first did Jujitsu,</v>

627
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:33.260
<v Speaker 1>there was this kid that I'll never</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget this purple belt kid my age,</v>

628
00:24:33.261 --> 00:24:38.261
<v Speaker 1>my size is nothing special about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's just maul me.</v>

629
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Every class he would maul me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like I was a baby.</v>

630
00:24:42.021 --> 00:24:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Like I couldn't do anything to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't defend myself.</v>

631
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I'd be exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just fucking strangle me and I have</v>

632
00:24:47.721 --> 00:24:51.650
<v Speaker 1>to tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just so humiliating and humbling.</v>

633
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.060
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking,</v>

634
00:24:53.061 --> 00:24:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was walking around,</v>

635
00:24:54.741 --> 00:24:57.500
<v Speaker 1>not even knowing somebody my size could</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that to me.</v>

636
00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.070
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really had no idea.</v>

637
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.350
<v Speaker 1>So living in a completely delusional</v>
<v Speaker 1>world of martial arts,</v>

638
00:25:03.351 --> 00:25:04.111
<v Speaker 1>proudness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

639
00:25:04.111 --> 00:25:08.450
<v Speaker 1>we have to remember that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that we're a hair at all is</v>

640
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.760
<v Speaker 1>at some point during our human</v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

641
00:25:10.761 --> 00:25:12.580
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

642
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.460
<v Speaker 1>instinctively and just accidentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized that we can't rely on our</v>

643
00:25:16.461 --> 00:25:17.360
<v Speaker 1>strength or speed.</v>

644
00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.350
<v Speaker 1>We had to rely on our brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cause it,</v>

645
00:25:20.351 --> 00:25:22.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't just run out and grab the line</v>

646
00:25:22.101 --> 00:25:25.010
<v Speaker 1>and rip its head off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We either run from it and find a stick</v>

647
00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:28.220
<v Speaker 1>and sharpen it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go out in teams and you know,</v>

648
00:25:28.221 --> 00:25:31.120
<v Speaker 1>take down the elephant with five guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

649
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:33.530
<v Speaker 1>so that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you think of martial arts in</v>

650
00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:37.100
<v Speaker 1>that manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to realize how important the</v>

651
00:25:37.101 --> 00:25:39.740
<v Speaker 1>mental game is as opposed to just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical game.</v>

652
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in Jujitsu,</v>

653
00:25:40.971 --> 00:25:44.660
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the rare martial arts were</v>
<v Speaker 1>technique is really the most important</v>

654
00:25:44.661 --> 00:25:45.650
<v Speaker 1>aspect of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

655
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.700
<v Speaker 1>of the practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you get a really big strong</v>

656
00:25:49.701 --> 00:25:52.310
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a disadvantage for a</v>

657
00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:56.120
<v Speaker 1>strong guy to learn Jujitsu because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best technical guides are always small,</v>

658
00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:58.700
<v Speaker 1>weaker guys cause they have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>technical.</v>

659
00:25:58.701 --> 00:26:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Then there's nothing they can muscle or</v>
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>

660
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the big guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can get away with some sloppy shit</v>

661
00:26:04.401 --> 00:26:05.990
<v Speaker 1>because of the fact that they're big and</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>

662
00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:09.020
<v Speaker 1>So they're really hindering themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>by using strength.</v>

663
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no sport like that and no</v>

664
00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:14.820
<v Speaker 1>martial art even like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean technique is very important.</v>

665
00:26:14.821 --> 00:26:17.660
<v Speaker 1>And kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but athleticism and speed is equally</v>

666
00:26:17.661 --> 00:26:18.441
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

667
00:26:18.441 --> 00:26:20.570
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're very technical but slow,</v>

668
00:26:20.571 --> 00:26:22.250
<v Speaker 1>it really won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Jujitsu,</v>

669
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:23.290
<v Speaker 1>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

670
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.100
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the saddest thing about rolling with</v>

671
00:26:25.101 --> 00:26:27.440
<v Speaker 1>someone like a Hixon or as John John</v>
<v Speaker 1>Machado,</v>

672
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like they don't even try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

673
00:26:29.751 --> 00:26:32.780
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they're straining and</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving hardly to slowly,</v>

674
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.790
<v Speaker 1>oh my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

675
00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:36.380
<v Speaker 1>you're on your back again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

676
00:26:36.381 --> 00:26:38.540
<v Speaker 1>you better protect this arm because this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the one,</v>

677
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.110
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight and seven.</v>

678
00:26:42.111 --> 00:26:43.290
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's he going to do?</v>

679
00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:45.660
<v Speaker 1>And then he does it and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

680
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Hixon would do that to black belts who</v>
<v Speaker 1>would pick an arm and tell them,</v>

681
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get your right arm in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>arm bar.</v>

682
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.680
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no fucking way.</v>

683
00:26:52.681 --> 00:26:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it want to chicken my in this</v>

684
00:26:54.481 --> 00:26:57.210
<v Speaker 1>mother fucker arms over there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how are you going to get me in an</v>

685
00:26:57.211 --> 00:26:58.740
<v Speaker 1>arm bar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden he's over there and</v>

686
00:26:58.741 --> 00:27:00.490
<v Speaker 1>you're tapping out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

687
00:27:00.491 --> 00:27:02.040
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that there was something</v>

688
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:03.120
<v Speaker 1>like that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>

689
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:05.450
<v Speaker 1>once you understand like how technical</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is,</v>

690
00:27:05.451 --> 00:27:08.840
<v Speaker 1>it really become so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh Waitzkin is a,</v>

691
00:27:08.841 --> 00:27:12.930
<v Speaker 1>a famous chess player.</v>

692
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Fisher was based on him and he sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>got disillusioned with Chaz after a</v>

693
00:27:17.571 --> 00:27:21.510
<v Speaker 1>while I got bored with it and devoted</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same energy to Jujitsu and he's one</v>

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.870
<v Speaker 1>the website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has it broken down the way you would</v>

701
00:27:39.871 --> 00:27:40.770
<v Speaker 1>break down chess.</v>

702
00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Like he breaks down moves and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

703
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different transitions,</v>

704
00:27:44.761 --> 00:27:46.460
<v Speaker 1>different moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can look at it,</v>

705
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:49.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and much more may be analytical and you</v>

<v Speaker 1>a calculated move,</v>

707
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.210
<v Speaker 1>move way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you would,</v>

<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Chin talked shoulders up,</v>

743
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:23.550
<v Speaker 1>move to your right side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he's throwing the left first doc on</v>

744
00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:24.960
<v Speaker 1>de,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then go for a single.</v>

745
00:29:24.961 --> 00:29:28.080
<v Speaker 1>The single does not work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You transitioned to a double have water,</v>

746
00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.840
<v Speaker 1>three deep breath and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this guy knows exactly what I'm supposed</v>

749
00:29:36.571 --> 00:29:38.340
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I could just listen to this guy,</v>

750
00:29:38.341 --> 00:29:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy world.</v>

751
00:29:41.351 --> 00:29:46.310
<v Speaker 1>The world of intelligence and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and risk and martial art and that's what</v>

752
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:49.150
<v Speaker 1>w you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like for the wrong reasons.</v>

753
00:29:49.151 --> 00:29:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Associate martial arts and especially</v>
<v Speaker 1>associate competition with meatheads</v>

754
00:29:53.531 --> 00:29:54.730
<v Speaker 1>assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dummies.</v>

755
00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:58.960
<v Speaker 1>But the most brilliant minds and some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting people that I've</v>

756
00:29:58.961 --> 00:30:00.730
<v Speaker 1>ever met when martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 1>practitioners,</v>

757
00:30:00.731 --> 00:30:04.540
<v Speaker 1>because there's a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculation you have to do.</v>

758
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.140
<v Speaker 1>While under extreme duress and pressure</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a risk involved.</v>

759
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.950
<v Speaker 1>The risk is like physical health and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those together created an incredible</v>

760
00:30:11.951 --> 00:30:14.530
<v Speaker 1>ward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're successful in the reward is</v>

761
00:30:14.531 --> 00:30:17.770
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the downside is like mad for most</v>

762
00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:20.260
<v Speaker 1>people that the down is too low and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid it.</v>

763
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:25.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's the people that can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can make their way through those waters.</v>

764
00:30:25.271 --> 00:30:27.220
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strongest salmon who get up that</v>

765
00:30:27.221 --> 00:30:29.980
<v Speaker 1>waterfall to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the most interesting people that</v>

766
00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I've ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

767
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I would have to agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

768
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I got out of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>

769
00:30:34.391 --> 00:30:35.590
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy gets it.</v>

770
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:36.280
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

771
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.660
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing the essence of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what this is all about.</v>

772
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:42.220
<v Speaker 1>How long have you been doing Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

773
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.710
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started in the mid to late nineties.</v>

774
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.400
<v Speaker 4>I got injured right around 2000 and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>have only done it,</v>

775
00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on and off now whenever I can,</v>

776
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.500
<v Speaker 4>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're doing your wines,</v>

777
00:30:55.501 --> 00:30:58.530
<v Speaker 4>it must be like 16 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My must be.</v>

778
00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:59.290
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

779
00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.123
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty,</v>

780
00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:02.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty organized so I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

781
00:31:02.921 --> 00:31:06.480
<v Speaker 4>I make sure that whatever I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever I can bring to the table as far</v>

782
00:31:06.481 --> 00:31:09.720
<v Speaker 4>as making things easier and smoother and</v>
<v Speaker 4>not getting in my own way,</v>

783
00:31:09.721 --> 00:31:11.760
<v Speaker 4>like just a lot of logistics and</v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding.</v>

784
00:31:11.761 --> 00:31:15.360
<v Speaker 4>Like if I do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have to undo this and five</v>

785
00:31:15.361 --> 00:31:17.460
<v Speaker 4>moves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I always like,</v>

786
00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:19.620
<v Speaker 4>I've laid things out in a manner that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

787
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the winery around 6:00 AM six 30</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm wrapping it up around eight</v>

788
00:31:24.421 --> 00:31:26.570
<v Speaker 4>o'clock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're a black belt in winemaking,</v>

789
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.080
<v Speaker 4>sweating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to say I'm a black building</v>

790
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.210
<v Speaker 4>logistics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blackbelt logistics,</v>

791
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.540
<v Speaker 4>just understanding the process and not</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting in my own way.</v>

792
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:37.580
<v Speaker 1>And then when you go from that mode into</v>
<v Speaker 1>musician mode,</v>

793
00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.920
<v Speaker 1>do you just do it on based on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule?</v>

794
00:31:39.921 --> 00:31:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Like whenever your time becomes free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

795
00:31:41.781 --> 00:31:42.411
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

796
00:31:42.411 --> 00:31:43.244
<v Speaker 1>starting in</v>

797
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.270
<v Speaker 4>it's October or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit more emotion,</v>

798
00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:49.420
<v Speaker 4>a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a random this with that.</v>

799
00:31:49.421 --> 00:31:50.051
<v Speaker 4>With that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

800
00:31:50.051 --> 00:31:52.330
<v Speaker 4>you kind of have to kind of ride those</v>
<v Speaker 4>waves a little bit.</v>

801
00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:54.940
<v Speaker 4>But in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have enough time under your</v>

802
00:31:54.941 --> 00:31:58.360
<v Speaker 4>belt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can kind of force the situation.</v>

803
00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.620
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

804
00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:03.310
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times I just get in my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my truck and I got a decent stereo on</v>

805
00:32:03.311 --> 00:32:05.140
<v Speaker 4>the truck and I got the tracks and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

806
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.770
<v Speaker 4>that way nobody can mess with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't get a phone call and they'll be</v>

807
00:32:08.771 --> 00:32:12.160
<v Speaker 4>knocking on the door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just go park somewhere and turn the</v>

808
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:14.080
<v Speaker 4>music up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the notepad and start writing,</v>

809
00:32:14.081 --> 00:32:16.080
<v Speaker 4>cause nobody now you're in your world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he might,</v>

810
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.030
<v Speaker 4>if I'm in my house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the phone's going to ring.</v>

811
00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:22.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to check my email,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try to ask a question.</v>

812
00:32:22.751 --> 00:32:24.850
<v Speaker 4>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>males in,</v>

<v Speaker 4>So much for writing.</v>

847
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.080
<v Speaker 4>it only took a little bit of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

848
00:33:48.081 --> 00:33:49.340
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get me wrong,</v>

849
00:33:49.341 --> 00:33:51.130
<v Speaker 4>I got a lot out of this town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things,</v>

850
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>odd things happen for me.</v>

851
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.930
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just kind of set the ball in</v>

852
00:33:56.931 --> 00:33:57.764
<v Speaker 4>motion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

853
00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was doing a lot of things,</v>

854
00:33:59.391 --> 00:34:01.530
<v Speaker 4>we'll buy life before I moved to La.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

855
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.010
<v Speaker 4>and there's a lot of achievements and</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that I'd,</v>

856
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.900
<v Speaker 4>that I'd kind of done for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

857
00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then it wasn't until I was actually</v>

858
00:34:08.931 --> 00:34:12.770
<v Speaker 4>in la in a band where somebody who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>profiting on my decision making that you</v>

859
00:34:12.771 --> 00:34:13.610
<v Speaker 4>actually heard about me.</v>

860
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.750
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

861
00:34:14.751 --> 00:34:16.700
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of things that I was kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of doing before I got here.</v>

862
00:34:16.701 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 4>And then I fell into the band thing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of got popular.</v>

863
00:34:20.661 --> 00:34:21.494
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

864
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.500
<v Speaker 4>that was my actually stuck here for as</v>
<v Speaker 4>long as I did.</v>

865
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.840
<v Speaker 4>Cause I just within like a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

866
00:34:26.841 --> 00:34:28.400
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not for me.</v>

867
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:29.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to be in a small town.</v>

868
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:33.290
<v Speaker 4>When it got to a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have the fame of tool,</v>

869
00:34:33.291 --> 00:34:36.320
<v Speaker 4>you could pretty much have done whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to anyway because you're mostly</v>

870
00:34:36.321 --> 00:34:38.540
<v Speaker 4>just touring and you just had to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>around the people when you were</v>

871
00:34:38.541 --> 00:34:39.740
<v Speaker 4>rehearsing and preparing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

872
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:40.873
<v Speaker 4>Kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

873
00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.500
<v Speaker 4>I think a little bit more hands on than</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

874
00:34:42.501 --> 00:34:43.334
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

875
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:44.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the most part,</v>

876
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

877
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.400
<v Speaker 4>that was the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

878
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:49.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then been been from 95 to 2000.</v>

879
00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.700
<v Speaker 4>I kind of bounced back and forth a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit from Arizona to here just</v>

880
00:34:52.701 --> 00:34:53.990
<v Speaker 4>because of the work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

881
00:34:53.991 --> 00:34:55.670
<v Speaker 4>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're recording and doing stuff,</v>

882
00:34:55.671 --> 00:34:57.940
<v Speaker 4>he had to kind of be there for Nda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

883
00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:02.660
<v Speaker 4>You're on the road for pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that in those days it was easily six</v>

884
00:35:02.661 --> 00:35:04.100
<v Speaker 4>months out of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a year traveling.</v>

885
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.650
<v Speaker 4>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're younger than you can handle it.</v>

886
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:09.470
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The area you're out,</v>

887
00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:11.720
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like a haunted wild west town,</v>

888
00:35:11.721 --> 00:35:12.650
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an old,</v>

889
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.720
<v Speaker 4>it's an old copper mining town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

890
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:19.220
<v Speaker 4>it's like a billion dollar copper mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It had this huge or body underneath this</v>

891
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:23.420
<v Speaker 4>side of this hill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>$1 billion worth of copper.</v>

892
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:24.550
<v Speaker 4>And that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

893
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:27.110
<v Speaker 4>1920s,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1930s billions.</v>

894
00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.420
<v Speaker 4>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a huge or body,</v>

895
00:35:29.421 --> 00:35:32.570
<v Speaker 4>like big enough to put a cathedral in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hole in the ground that they took</v>

896
00:35:32.571 --> 00:35:33.404
<v Speaker 4>all the copper up.</v>

897
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:38.430
<v Speaker 4>And did you pick this area because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>just seemed like an area or you don't</v>

898
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.840
<v Speaker 4>really like the vibe of it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

899
00:35:39.841 --> 00:35:41.040
<v Speaker 4>I am at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a dream.</v>

900
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.810
<v Speaker 4>I was supposed to be out of fucking la.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got it.</v>

901
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just kept having this recurring</v>

902
00:35:46.651 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 4>dream and it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

903
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:52.410
<v Speaker 4>it was a very specific images and place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

904
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.240
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

905
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.630
<v Speaker 4>for some reason I thought it was Arizona</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a,</v>

906
00:35:57.631 --> 00:35:59.940
<v Speaker 4>I remember talking to Hicks about it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go on,</v>

907
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:01.770
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was supposed to be in</v>

908
00:36:01.771 --> 00:36:03.610
<v Speaker 4>Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

909
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:06.580
<v Speaker 4>I mentioned that to Tim Alexander and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

910
00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:07.710
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been to Phoenix,</v>

911
00:36:07.711 --> 00:36:08.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not having it.</v>

912
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.270
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I described the dream and Tim went,</v>

913
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.070
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what that is.</v>

914
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.130
<v Speaker 4>See Cause he's from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's from Arizona.</v>

915
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.420
<v Speaker 4>And so he went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

916
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:20.760
<v Speaker 4>I have to take you some place.</v>

917
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.370
<v Speaker 4>We drove up there and like rolling into</v>
<v Speaker 4>that valley just going,</v>

918
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.920
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

919
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:27.990
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I got up to the town,</v>

920
00:36:27.991 --> 00:36:30.330
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no shit.</v>

921
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:34.320
<v Speaker 4>Do you interact with the town's folks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because to me that's the hardest thing</v>

922
00:36:34.321 --> 00:36:35.730
<v Speaker 4>about moving to anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

924
00:36:37.501 --> 00:36:40.670
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am the absolute troublemaker in that</v>

925
00:36:40.671 --> 00:36:41.790
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It comes in,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

929
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.620
<v Speaker 4>they kind of turned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of that went away.</v>

930
00:36:47.621 --> 00:36:49.630
<v Speaker 4>It's like 20,000 people in this town at</v>
<v Speaker 4>one point.</v>

931
00:36:49.631 --> 00:36:52.260
<v Speaker 4>And we'd have working the mind like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the Clarkdale area and to</v>

932
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.780
<v Speaker 4>Cottonwood area and draw Mary work in</v>
<v Speaker 4>his mind,</v>

933
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:55.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

934
00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to dry it up and you know,</v>

935
00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.510
<v Speaker 4>there was the depression and the World</v>
<v Speaker 4>War One and doing all that kind of</v>

936
00:37:00.511 --> 00:37:00.930
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

937
00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.790
<v Speaker 4>It kind of shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It dropped down to like,</v>

938
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 people in this small town.</v>

939
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.780
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then of course,</v>

940
00:37:06.781 --> 00:37:08.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 70,</v>

941
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:08.831
<v Speaker 4>60,</v>
<v Speaker 4>70,</v>

942
00:37:08.831 --> 00:37:12.450
<v Speaker 4>so the draft Dodgers and the people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>just wanted to do what they wanted to</v>

943
00:37:12.451 --> 00:37:13.700
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

944
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.810
<v Speaker 4>moved into this basically in abandoned</v>
<v Speaker 4>town.</v>

945
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:18.150
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone new Bisbee no.</v>

946
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.610
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure we're Bisbee is,</v>

947
00:37:20.611 --> 00:37:21.940
<v Speaker 4>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's more on the,</v>

948
00:37:21.941 --> 00:37:24.090
<v Speaker 4>on the edge of the state and somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very weird,</v>

949
00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.280
<v Speaker 4>but a very similar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very similar scenario.</v>

950
00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.680
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the trust fund babies and the hippies</v>

951
00:37:28.681 --> 00:37:31.490
<v Speaker 4>moved in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of took over the town and uh,</v>

952
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.060
<v Speaker 4>there for them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

953
00:37:33.061 --> 00:37:36.510
<v Speaker 4>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that moved into the town are</v>

954
00:37:36.511 --> 00:37:39.060
<v Speaker 4>not the kind of people that built the</v>
<v Speaker 4>town,</v>

955
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.860
<v Speaker 4>not the kind of visionary as it came in</v>
<v Speaker 4>and went,</v>

956
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.070
<v Speaker 4>I think there's copper under this thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then did all this stuff.</v>

957
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm more like those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm kind of the enemy because I</v>

958
00:37:47.251 --> 00:37:49.020
<v Speaker 4>do stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

959
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:51.480
<v Speaker 4>heaven forbid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

960
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.300
<v Speaker 4>so how you a trouble maker and the town</v>
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>

961
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.280
<v Speaker 4>anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

962
00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they fear change.</v>

963
00:37:55.381 --> 00:37:58.680
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we came here to retire and then not do</v>

964
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:01.590
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you make too much noise or too</v>

965
00:38:01.591 --> 00:38:04.170
<v Speaker 4>strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just stuff I'm just doing stuff,</v>

966
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:05.610
<v Speaker 4>bringing by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

967
00:38:05.611 --> 00:38:09.060
<v Speaker 4>by discovering the terroir there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>making wine there.</v>

968
00:38:09.061 --> 00:38:12.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm bringing people to town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're what you're bringing people on.</v>

969
00:38:12.061 --> 00:38:14.730
<v Speaker 4>We went on to new people in town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're telling how they going to pay</v>

970
00:38:14.731 --> 00:38:18.720
<v Speaker 4>for your pipes in your electric and how</v>
<v Speaker 4>are going to make your streets be safe.</v>

971
00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:21.090
<v Speaker 4>It's a municipality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a camping ground.</v>

972
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.440
<v Speaker 4>You need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he need funding.</v>

973
00:38:24.441 --> 00:38:26.330
<v Speaker 4>You need tax dollars to fix your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

974
00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.910
<v Speaker 4>the best way to really fix your town is</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have something that's unique to</v>

975
00:38:29.911 --> 00:38:32.580
<v Speaker 4>your town and export,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you will.</v>

976
00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:34.740
<v Speaker 4>I found it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How dare I?</v>

977
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.140
<v Speaker 4>So you're doing well for the town and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just don't like anything moving or</v>

978
00:38:38.141 --> 00:38:40.060
<v Speaker 4>anyone to make them feel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a handful of people that are</v>

979
00:38:40.061 --> 00:38:42.100
<v Speaker 4>like the hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a handful of people that are</v>

980
00:38:42.101 --> 00:38:43.290
<v Speaker 4>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're their mos.</v>

981
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 4>You just lay in the street and if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can move them,</v>

982
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:47.230
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can kind of go down the street.</v>

983
00:38:47.231 --> 00:38:48.610
<v Speaker 4>But if you can't move them and you give</v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

984
00:38:48.611 --> 00:38:52.330
<v Speaker 4>they win and you just kind of sail tail</v>
<v Speaker 4>between your legs and you leave.</v>

985
00:38:52.331 --> 00:38:55.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to move stuff.</v>

986
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 4>That's my problem with La is that La is</v>
<v Speaker 4>where my friends are and if I had to</v>

987
00:38:59.411 --> 00:39:02.260
<v Speaker 4>move to another place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to deal with a bunch of fucking</v>

988
00:39:02.261 --> 00:39:04.900
<v Speaker 4>people and all their nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

989
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.410
<v Speaker 4>unless you bring everybody with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is also going to start a</v>

990
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:09.263
<v Speaker 4>complicated.</v>

991
00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:10.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get all Kuresh on it.</v>

992
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:13.050
<v Speaker 4>Do you have friends out in Jerome?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

993
00:39:13.051 --> 00:39:15.010
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you have them already?</v>

994
00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.230
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amy,</v>

995
00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.590
<v Speaker 4>I made a lot of friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just some really,</v>

996
00:39:17.591 --> 00:39:20.140
<v Speaker 4>really awesome artists in that town,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really good people.</v>

997
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:21.790
<v Speaker 4>And they all mean well that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get me wrong,</v>

998
00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:24.130
<v Speaker 4>all of every single person in the talent</v>
<v Speaker 4>means well,</v>

999
00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.650
<v Speaker 4>and they're all good people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1000
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:29.470
<v Speaker 4>that's just personalities and small town</v>
<v Speaker 4>politics,</v>

1001
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:35.320
<v Speaker 4>but still better than the insane buzz of</v>
<v Speaker 4>this hive this fall.</v>

1002
00:39:35.321 --> 00:39:36.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>with our people and in Jerome over</v>

<v Speaker 4>stopped cars and you crawl into your</v>

1010

<v Speaker 4>This is just,</v>

1013
00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:08.230
<v Speaker 4>we're just banking on nothing going</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong ever in a place where the earth</v>

1014
00:40:08.231 --> 00:40:09.520
<v Speaker 4>moves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:40:23.231 --> 00:40:26.350
<v Speaker 4>when like you go to Denver and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>that area where almost everybody's</v>

<v Speaker 4>missing an eye and arm or in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>wheelchair or a walker.</v>

1023
00:40:29.611 --> 00:40:30.444
<v Speaker 4>That's like a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1024

<v Speaker 4>It's right on that 16th street promenade</v>

1033
00:40:53.891 --> 00:40:56.680
<v Speaker 4>area right there in no sin in the center</v>
<v Speaker 4>of town there.</v>

1034
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:58.580
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1035
00:40:58.830 --> 00:40:59.401
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1036
00:40:59.401 --> 00:41:01.720
<v Speaker 4>you're there for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're there for longer than 12</v>

1037
00:41:01.721 --> 00:41:02.554
<v Speaker 4>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>start going,</v>

1038
00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.880
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>

1039
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:07.870
<v Speaker 4>Is there like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1040
00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.820
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they testing out these things.</v>

1041
00:41:09.821 --> 00:41:11.350
<v Speaker 4>Are they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are these people actually in them?</v>

1042
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.900
<v Speaker 4>I've never noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I picked Denver because it's got a</v>

1043
00:41:13.901 --> 00:41:16.720
<v Speaker 4>strong medical marijuana community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then so once you get used to,</v>

1044
00:41:16.721 --> 00:41:20.890
<v Speaker 4>the way they have it set up in La is you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't deal with the nonsense of dealing</v>

1045
00:41:20.891 --> 00:41:23.260
<v Speaker 4>with drug dealers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just become so stupid.</v>

1046
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:28.390
<v Speaker 4>But Denver set up pretty much exactly</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Ella is Denver in boulder.</v>

1047
00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.030
<v Speaker 4>There's places everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a,</v>

1048
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:31.780
<v Speaker 4>I think they call it broad stir.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>

1049
00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 4>When they have one area where it's</v>

1050
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Broadway,</v>

1051
00:41:35.211 --> 00:41:36.170
<v Speaker 1>there was this like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1052
00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.110
<v Speaker 1>bakery shops and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal.</v>

1053
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.410
<v Speaker 1>It's got a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to like a sensible liberal</v>

1054
00:41:42.411 --> 00:41:43.340
<v Speaker 1>vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1055
00:41:43.341 --> 00:41:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Denver in a Boulder's a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 1>radical,</v>

1056
00:41:45.801 --> 00:41:48.920
<v Speaker 1>but Denver has a sensible openminded</v>
<v Speaker 1>vibe.</v>

1057
00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Like they support guns and they support</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and they support outdoors</v>

1058
00:41:52.791 --> 00:41:55.430
<v Speaker 1>activities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also in favor of gay</v>

1059
00:41:55.431 --> 00:41:58.200
<v Speaker 1>marriage and they're also in favor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>not discriminating.</v>

1060
00:41:58.201 --> 00:41:58.821
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

1061
00:41:58.821 --> 00:42:00.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I picked it,</v>

1062
00:42:00.801 --> 00:42:03.020
<v Speaker 1>but Arizona always scared me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1063
00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.330
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely a scary place when,</v>

1064
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:05.850
<v Speaker 1>in terms of</v>

1065
00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:07.800
<v Speaker 3>all those things you just mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's,</v>

1066
00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.370
<v Speaker 3>I think all that stuff's kinda changing</v>
<v Speaker 3>there because you can't have something</v>

1067
00:42:11.371 --> 00:42:16.260
<v Speaker 3>that's so far one way and not have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushback and have and have and have a</v>

1068
00:42:16.261 --> 00:42:18.600
<v Speaker 3>community that's just the complete polar</v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite.</v>

1069
00:42:18.601 --> 00:42:22.440
<v Speaker 3>And it's absolutely there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So eventually it'll just kind of come</v>

1070
00:42:22.441 --> 00:42:23.274
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

1071
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.160
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of living in cities,</v>

1072
00:42:25.161 --> 00:42:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one day not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary anymore.</v>

1073
00:42:28.491 --> 00:42:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I think we needed it because everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to be on top everybody.</v>

1074
00:42:31.911 --> 00:42:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's where you worked and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1075
00:42:33.291 --> 00:42:35.690
<v Speaker 1>in order to communicate with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now because of the Internet,</v>

1076
00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:36.920
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1077
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:39.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people's jobs that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to be in,</v>

1078
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.550
<v Speaker 1>in the swarm.</v>

1079
00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of,</v>

1080
00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:45.330
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely a lot of just change</v>
<v Speaker 3>in general happening with the,</v>

1081
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:46.960
<v Speaker 3>just the way we think about stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1082
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about you,</v>

1083
00:42:48.611 --> 00:42:52.930
<v Speaker 3>but I've had like a had a week there</v>
<v Speaker 3>about two months ago or it's just,</v>

1084
00:42:52.931 --> 00:42:57.670
<v Speaker 3>everything just seemed like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gyroscopes were off and I couldn't,</v>

1085
00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.970
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get anything right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like I'd forgotten how to do the</v>

1086
00:43:00.971 --> 00:43:02.490
<v Speaker 3>most simple things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1087
00:43:02.491 --> 00:43:03.610
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1088
00:43:03.611 --> 00:43:04.750
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the perfect example.</v>

1089
00:43:04.751 --> 00:43:09.751
<v Speaker 3>I got to walk outside to change a tire</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've got like a carrot and a candle.</v>

1090
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1091
00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:11.453
<v Speaker 3>well</v>

1092
00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:13.090
<v Speaker 1>one lane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a cycle,</v>

1093
00:43:13.091 --> 00:43:14.710
<v Speaker 1>like a vibe or I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

1094
00:43:14.711 --> 00:43:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I still kind of feel a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1095
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:16.990
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1096
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:19.000
<v Speaker 3>I kind of called a friend who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1097
00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:21.070
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1098
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:22.450
<v Speaker 3>she's as crazy as I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really,</v>

1099
00:43:22.451 --> 00:43:23.310
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1100
00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.120
<v Speaker 3>she does a complete Kundalini Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1101
00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.770
<v Speaker 3>unless she wakes up at 4:00 AM to watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sunrise and do the breath of fire.</v>

1102
00:43:29.771 --> 00:43:31.300
<v Speaker 3>And so she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1103
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:33.730
<v Speaker 3>how the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a complete Kook and I'm an,</v>

1104
00:43:33.731 --> 00:43:35.920
<v Speaker 3>I drank the Koolaid or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or we're onto something here.</v>

1105
00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.173
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1106
00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.133
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

1107
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:41.250
<v Speaker 3>she said just being a funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should ask that because that's kind</v>

1108
00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:43.930
<v Speaker 3>of what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what she's seeing in her world,</v>

1109
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.660
<v Speaker 3>how everything's done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1110
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:48.100
<v Speaker 3>the gyroscopes or just kind of off and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1111
00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.610
<v Speaker 3>and the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the biggest thing she was</v>

1112
00:43:51.611 --> 00:43:53.760
<v Speaker 3>suggesting and has kind of done some</v>
<v Speaker 3>reading on it as well,</v>

1113
00:43:53.761 --> 00:43:56.950
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just more a matter of paying</v>

1114
00:43:56.951 --> 00:44:01.390
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not letting it get to you,</v>

1115
00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:03.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not being like all,</v>

1116
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tony Robbins and get all,</v>

1117
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:06.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive greeny guy,</v>

1118
00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:07.540
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1119
00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:09.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like know that it's all gonna work</v>

1120
00:44:09.341 --> 00:44:12.550
<v Speaker 3>out and don't let the petty shit get you</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1121
00:44:12.551 --> 00:44:16.000
<v Speaker 3>Don't let the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dark stuff sink in because it's</v>

1122
00:44:16.001 --> 00:44:19.480
<v Speaker 3>almost like you're in a record groove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in the light groove,</v>

1123
00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.930
<v Speaker 3>and if you let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've flop over to the dark groove,</v>

1124
00:44:22.931 --> 00:44:26.170
<v Speaker 3>you kind of get stuck in that groove and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a downward spiral.</v>

1125
00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:29.950
<v Speaker 1>So one thing that I've found it's most</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to deal with when you deal</v>

1126
00:44:29.951 --> 00:44:34.080
<v Speaker 1>with a large city or a large as you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly getting other people's</v>

1127
00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:37.440
<v Speaker 1>energy in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sometimes hard to dictate your own</v>

1128
00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:39.780
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what she was saying</v>

1129
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:43.680
<v Speaker 3>because I think in a way you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of just not hang out on a fear.</v>

1130
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of settle in calmly and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're talking about what the</v>

1131
00:44:48.991 --> 00:44:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy,</v>

1132
00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:51.540
<v Speaker 3>he's big and he's strong and he's got</v>
<v Speaker 3>technique,</v>

1133
00:44:51.541 --> 00:44:55.920
<v Speaker 3>but you just had to take a deep breath</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some level know that one way or</v>

1134
00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:59.550
<v Speaker 3>another it's all gonna work out as</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kundalini Yoga people are fascinating.</v>

1135
00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.110
<v Speaker 3>A buddy of mine has a friend that does</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same thing</v>

1136
00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:05.300
<v Speaker 1>every morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She does the breath of fire and she</v>

1137
00:45:05.301 --> 00:45:08.570
<v Speaker 1>claims to achieve psychedelic states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says that,</v>

1138
00:45:08.571 --> 00:45:10.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of all her years of practice,</v>

1139
00:45:10.251 --> 00:45:12.260
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like as if she's taking heavy</v>

1140
00:45:12.261 --> 00:45:14.750
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes to other worlds and</v>

1141
00:45:14.751 --> 00:45:18.080
<v Speaker 1>communicates with entities and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and has,</v>

1142
00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:20.450
<v Speaker 1>what she describes is indescribable</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

1143
00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:22.850
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I told you what I could do just with</v>

1144
00:45:22.851 --> 00:45:25.670
<v Speaker 1>my own breath exercises and couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daleney Yoga,</v>

1145
00:45:25.671 --> 00:45:26.504
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't believe me.</v>

1146
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.440
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1147
00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.430
<v Speaker 3>most of my friends that are in into that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

1148
00:45:29.431 --> 00:45:31.350
<v Speaker 3>into that deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't talk about it just because</v>

1149
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.890
<v Speaker 3>it's such an individual experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1150
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.320
<v Speaker 3>and I had another friend who I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to similar,</v>

1151
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:41.070
<v Speaker 3>a similar path and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she kind of grew up in the,</v>

1152
00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:42.720
<v Speaker 3>in the 60 was everybody's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1153
00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.960
<v Speaker 3>doing acid and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1154
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.890
<v Speaker 3>she had mentioned that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1155
00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.600
<v Speaker 3>it was Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was cool for the,</v>

1156
00:45:48.601 --> 00:45:52.530
<v Speaker 3>the jumpstart for people to kind of get</v>
<v Speaker 3>into that consciousness and be thinking</v>

1157
00:45:52.531 --> 00:45:54.570
<v Speaker 3>on that level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>

1158
00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:56.790
<v Speaker 3>they didn't really do the work to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1159
00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.520
<v Speaker 3>So they really didn't understand what it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was they were experiencing.</v>

1160
00:45:59.521 --> 00:46:02.520
<v Speaker 3>So when away she called it spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 3>theft,</v>

1161
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.230
<v Speaker 3>but you got like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden you're just right in</v>

1162
00:46:04.231 --> 00:46:06.060
<v Speaker 3>the middle of this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't really have any business</v>

1163
00:46:06.061 --> 00:46:06.860
<v Speaker 3>being there.</v>

1164
00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.730
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't really process what it is that</v>

1165
00:46:08.731 --> 00:46:11.370
<v Speaker 3>you're experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Recreational mushroom trips.</v>

1166
00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:12.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1167
00:46:12.241 --> 00:46:13.260
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so you're like,</v>

1168
00:46:13.261 --> 00:46:14.280
<v Speaker 3>here you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1169
00:46:14.281 --> 00:46:15.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for most people that just,</v>

1170
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:19.920
<v Speaker 3>that's lights out for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be a little mark the</v>

1171
00:46:19.921 --> 00:46:22.620
<v Speaker 3>rest of their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I kind of agree with that.</v>

1172
00:46:22.621 --> 00:46:25.950
<v Speaker 3>I think that some of the work taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>that time and really taking your time,</v>

1173
00:46:25.951 --> 00:46:29.880
<v Speaker 3>getting to those states are in just in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life in general and doing anything.</v>

1174
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:31.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1175
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.880
<v Speaker 3>it's really difficult for most people</v>
<v Speaker 3>these days because they want what they</v>

1176
00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:39.150
<v Speaker 3>want when they want it because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>so used to getting whatever the fuck it</v>

1177
00:46:39.151 --> 00:46:41.550
<v Speaker 3>is they want when they want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't get it.</v>

1178
00:46:41.551 --> 00:46:43.590
<v Speaker 3>They lose their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1179
00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Which is exactly opposite of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experience.</v>

1180
00:46:46.551 --> 00:46:48.020
<v Speaker 1>What it would teach you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1181
00:46:48.021 --> 00:46:48.731
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1182
00:46:48.731 --> 00:46:52.190
<v Speaker 1>the approach is so important and doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work and saying,</v>

1183
00:46:52.191 --> 00:46:55.500
<v Speaker 1>doing the work is so important because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're treating whatever this experience</v>

1184
00:46:55.501 --> 00:46:57.500
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be with a,</v>

1185
00:46:57.501 --> 00:47:01.430
<v Speaker 1>a deep amount of respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unless you do that,</v>

1186
00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:03.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're,</v>

1187
00:47:03.111 --> 00:47:04.910
<v Speaker 1>you're really going to get the most out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

1188
00:47:04.911 --> 00:47:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just go into it and try to just,</v>

1189
00:47:07.611 --> 00:47:11.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it cure you or let it figure you out</v>

1190
00:47:11.001 --> 00:47:13.010
<v Speaker 1>or let it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to be too blown away</v>

1191
00:47:13.011 --> 00:47:15.680
<v Speaker 1>with the whole thing to really absorb</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of it.</v>

1192
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing the work.</v>

1193
00:47:17.691 --> 00:47:19.880
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I really</v>

1194
00:47:19.881 --> 00:47:23.780
<v Speaker 1>appreciated about the people that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into Kundalini Yoga is they all seem</v>

1195
00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.900
<v Speaker 1>legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't met anybody who claims the</v>

1196
00:47:26.901 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic states who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't really like a humble person.</v>

1197
00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:34.330
<v Speaker 1>It really seemed like there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never any weird ego shit or you</v>

1198
00:47:34.331 --> 00:47:34.970
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>

1199
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:36.720
<v Speaker 1>a trace of bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1200
00:47:36.721 --> 00:47:39.850
<v Speaker 1>it seems like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just what they do.</v>

1201
00:47:39.851 --> 00:47:41.350
<v Speaker 1>And they'll tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to you about it and they'll</v>

1202
00:47:41.351 --> 00:47:43.660
<v Speaker 1>describe it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they say it's not about the,</v>

1203
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.670
<v Speaker 1>it's not about the psychedelic state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1204
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.030
<v Speaker 1>It's all about just like a sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1205
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:51.640
<v Speaker 1>it's about knowing that it's going to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>in knowing that it's all gonna work out.</v>

1206
00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1207
00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:56.850
<v Speaker 3>and we might not even be included in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this form that we're in and how it's</v>

1208
00:47:56.851 --> 00:47:59.190
<v Speaker 3>gonna work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you can let go of the fear of</v>

1209
00:47:59.191 --> 00:48:01.140
<v Speaker 3>worrying about whether that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen or not.</v>

1210
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.510
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you can just let go of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear and just,</v>

1211
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:04.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1212
00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:07.470
<v Speaker 1>let go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just appreciate what is,</v>

1213
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:10.290
<v Speaker 1>appreciate what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about what Ken,</v>

1214
00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:13.800
<v Speaker 1>what would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what may appreciate what is and know</v>

1215
00:48:13.801 --> 00:48:17.790
<v Speaker 1>that even if it doesn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to work out cause it's all</v>

1216
00:48:17.791 --> 00:48:20.520
<v Speaker 1>works out even if it doesn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1217
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:24.540
<v Speaker 1>It's too hard for us to wrap our heads</v>
<v Speaker 1>around how big the whole picture is.</v>

1218
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:25.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you realize that,</v>

1219
00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:27.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the,</v>

1220
00:48:27.441 --> 00:48:29.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1221
00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.530
<v Speaker 1>the Woodstock song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are stardust.</v>

1222
00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:34.020
<v Speaker 1>We are golden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are billion year old carbon.</v>

1223
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Well we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really are fucking Joni Mitchell.</v>

1224
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joni Mitchell,</v>

1225
00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:41.660
<v Speaker 1>who was the Crosby stills they covered</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what it was.</v>

1226
00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:42.570
<v Speaker 1>That's her song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1227
00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant Song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so true.</v>

1228
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.620
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing that people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

1229
00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Human beings actually made because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>star Burns out,</v>

1230
00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:52.320
<v Speaker 1>explodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it has to happen.</v>

1231
00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:55.410
<v Speaker 1>If it doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't make those materials and human</v>

1232
00:48:55.411 --> 00:48:57.000
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon based life forms don't,</v>

1233
00:48:57.001 --> 00:48:57.601
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't exist.</v>

1234
00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:59.940
<v Speaker 1>So even if it doesn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works out right.</v>

1235
00:48:59.941 --> 00:49:00.421
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1236

<v Speaker 1>that we're in and you know,</v>

1237

<v Speaker 1>this</v>

1238
00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.790
<v Speaker 3>real tactical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tactical,</v>

1239
00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:07.900
<v Speaker 3>tactical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1240
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.090
<v Speaker 3>existence that we live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1241
00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.530
<v Speaker 3>you get caught up with the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1242
00:49:10.531 --> 00:49:12.020
<v Speaker 3>you kind of get into the fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1243
00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:12.920
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1244
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.760

<v Speaker 3>Super easy.</v>

1245
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:15.900
<v Speaker 3>So it's okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>wrapped up in it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1248
00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:20.420

<v Speaker 3>it's almost like intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>people because I knew a bunch of other</v>

<v Speaker 4>The fault lies only in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1275
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:36.260
<v Speaker 4>abused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one and no thing for abuse turns the</v>

1276
00:50:36.261 --> 00:50:38.870
<v Speaker 4>wise ones into fools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Rob's a spirit of its division.</v>

1277
00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:43.940
<v Speaker 4>When it comes your time to die being out</v>
<v Speaker 4>like those whose hearts are filled with</v>

1278
00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:46.940
<v Speaker 4>fear and death so that their time comes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they weep,</v>

1279
00:50:46.941 --> 00:50:49.450
<v Speaker 4>they pray for more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little time and live their lives again</v>

1280
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:53.900
<v Speaker 4>over and over in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead sing near death song and die</v>

1281
00:50:53.901 --> 00:50:57.140
<v Speaker 4>like a hero going home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking beautiful.</v>

1282
00:50:57.510 --> 00:51:00.090
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so of course all my friends are like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>please don't say it's l,</v>

1288
00:51:11.751 --> 00:51:16.670
<v Speaker 4>Ron Hubbard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would be my luck like Adolf Hitler.</v>

1289
00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:20.140
<v Speaker 4>Well it sounds like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>

1290
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:22.660
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually found it online and it's</v>

<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He died in 18,</v>

1294
00:51:30.771 --> 00:51:32.750
<v Speaker 4>13.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1295

1296
00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:38.270
<v Speaker 1>more cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I thought it was some new age</v>

1297
00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:41.030
<v Speaker 1>douchebag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably pilfered some stuff off the</v>

1298
00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:43.000
<v Speaker 1>internet and pieced it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1299
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:44.080
<v Speaker 1>that's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1300
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I agree with everything you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except for Megan.</v>

1301
00:51:47.031 --> 00:51:47.864
<v Speaker 1>Front of religion.</v>

1302
00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:51.461
<v Speaker 4>You go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>girl.</v>

1303
00:51:51.461 --> 00:51:54.920
<v Speaker 4>Other than that it's got me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think religion has to be made fun of</v>

1304
00:51:54.921 --> 00:51:55.040
<v Speaker 4>it</v>

1305
00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.670
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't make fun of things that are</v>

1306
00:51:58.671 --> 00:52:00.500
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're missing out on a big part of</v>

1307
00:52:00.501 --> 00:52:02.800
<v Speaker 1>what's fun about this life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions.</v>

1308
00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous respect it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but made fun of it,</v>

1309
00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:05.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1310
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>

1311
00:52:07.131 --> 00:52:12.131
<v Speaker 1>I'm down town with the Shawnee warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had thought that was great that he,</v>

1312
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:14.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says some homeless dude while we</v>

1313
00:52:14.961 --> 00:52:18.110
<v Speaker 1>lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lost such a massive chunk of what</v>

1314
00:52:18.111 --> 00:52:22.910
<v Speaker 1>those people had learned about living</v>
<v Speaker 1>this life of nomadic life,</v>

1315
00:52:22.911 --> 00:52:26.180
<v Speaker 1>of following animals and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>following,</v>

1316
00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:31.160
<v Speaker 1>following herds of buffalo around and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and learning about the connection</v>

1317
00:52:31.161 --> 00:52:31.761
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1318
00:52:31.761 --> 00:52:32.930
<v Speaker 1>you gotta think about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1319
00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:37.430
<v Speaker 1>the deep respect native Americans had</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the animals that they killed.</v>

1320
00:52:37.431 --> 00:52:38.860
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1321
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:41.960
<v Speaker 1>it's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interesting way of life.</v>

1322
00:52:41.961 --> 00:52:45.050
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kept up for so long while most of</v>

1323
00:52:45.051 --> 00:52:47.630
<v Speaker 1>the Western world had already moved on</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1324
00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:52.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>riding horses and Kingdoms and houses</v>

1325
00:52:52.041 --> 00:52:56.180
<v Speaker 1>and agriculture and these people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>just traveling around and living off the</v>

1326
00:52:56.181 --> 00:52:58.850
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says so much wisdom we could have</v>

1327
00:52:58.851 --> 00:53:00.620
<v Speaker 1>learned from those people and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>wiped out.</v>

1328
00:53:00.621 --> 00:53:01.454
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1329
00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:03.470
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird time too when you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

1330
00:53:03.471 --> 00:53:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Just that was just a couple of hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

1331
00:53:05.301 --> 00:53:08.900
<v Speaker 1>a blip in human civilization and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was these nomadic people,</v>

1332
00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:10.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in this area.</v>

1333

1344
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:41.630
<v Speaker 3>exhilarating feeling of like this black</v>

<v Speaker 3>drop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1364
00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:38.200
<v Speaker 3>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got hit with Frost really hard and,</v>

1365
00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early 2011,</v>

1366
00:54:40.421 --> 00:54:44.020
<v Speaker 3>so we didn't have a lot of Arizona fruit</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our vineyards to work with.</v>

1367
00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:46.120
<v Speaker 3>So I panicked and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1368
00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.313
<v Speaker 3>is this one yours here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

1369
00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:50.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I sourced some fruit from right over</v>

1370
00:54:50.741 --> 00:54:52.900
<v Speaker 3>the border from our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our vineyards right down on the,</v>

1371
00:54:52.901 --> 00:54:53.890
<v Speaker 3>on the border,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1372
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:56.830
<v Speaker 3>on the 10 as you're heading toward New</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexico,</v>

1373
00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.880
<v Speaker 3>it's in Wilcox in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So right over that border,</v>

1374
00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:02.130
<v Speaker 3>like another hour or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just pass.</v>

1375
00:55:02.131 --> 00:55:06.130
<v Speaker 3>Wilcox is a New Mexico vineyard and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy's out there,</v>

1376
00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:09.190
<v Speaker 3>great grower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got all these fantastic Italian</v>

1377
00:55:09.191 --> 00:55:11.520
<v Speaker 3>varietals growing there and there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1378
00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:13.450
<v Speaker 3>there's a historic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a pretty old vineyard there.</v>

1379
00:55:13.451 --> 00:55:16.140
<v Speaker 3>So I picked these all these grapes up</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1380
00:55:16.141 --> 00:55:17.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not much.</v>

1381
00:55:17.081 --> 00:55:18.500
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did this blend.</v>

1382
00:55:18.501 --> 00:55:20.750
<v Speaker 3>It's Sangiovese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd dual Choate over phospho and</v>

1383
00:55:20.751 --> 00:55:23.140
<v Speaker 3>premed Tivo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a straight up the Italian blend.</v>

1384
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:26.590
<v Speaker 3>It's delicious from New Mexico grapes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

1385
