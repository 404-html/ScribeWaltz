1
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.320
Is that your new thing?
Yeah.
Oh,
okay.

2
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.540
Well this podcast is already been sponsored.

3
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.940
This shit is just no beginning,
no music,
Brian.

4
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.560
There's nothing.
Didn't need it to be done.
Yeah,
that's it.
Launch.

5
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.670
I'm tweeting sounds right now.

6
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.110
Boom.
So if you heard the news,
what's that?
Uh,

7
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.410
you're just hoping you knew something interesting.
Talk about.

8
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.000
<v 2>Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No one's have you,
uh,</v>

9
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.323
<v 1>whatever.</v>

10
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.000
<v 3>Dude,
I'm addicted to toilets now.</v>

11
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.900
I've been looking all over these Japanese toilets that we experienced in Japan.

12
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.660
And I,
it's funny because it's,

13
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.210
if you don't know what it is that they're heated already.

14
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.530
And so like when you sit down,
I,
it's uh,
it's like,

15
00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:56.890
it feels like somebody else has sat and sat down and taking a massive ship

16
00:00:56.891 --> 00:00:58.390
before you,
yeah.
Like,
you know what I mean?

17
00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.650
Like it's weird and inviting and then you take a shit and then you push a
button.

18
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.610
There's three buttons.
Like one is like hot water,
like me,

19
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.500
like a missile getting shot up your ass hot water.
And it feels really good.

20
00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.730
Like I tried to position my asshole

21
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.080
<v 2>Ms. One of them has big day wasn't the big day is like the blast of water that</v>

22
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:22.570
cleans your butt and then there's a mild spray and then as a whole

23
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.220
<v 3>wash it.
See Awesome.</v>

24
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.630
All of them seem pretty good and it seemed one was a little hotter than normal,

25
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.510
but like I didn't want to do the and also headed air dryer.

26
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:33.080
I don't know if you noticed that but I didn't want to sip,
wait for that.

27
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.100
Yeah that seemed to gay but yet meet trying to like move to have water in my ass

28
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:41.100
for 20 minutes.
I think I sat there,
I might at one point just trying to,

29
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.300
it felt really good.

30
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.960
<v 2>It does.
It does feel good.</v>

31
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.900
You never realize how little attention your asshole gets,

32
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.570
especially when it comes to pleasure devices and America.

33
00:01:49.571 --> 00:01:50.680
We have a problem with that.

34
00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:53.050
Like you can get something that massages your neck no problem.

35
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.620
But to have like a warm stream of water that constantly pummels your asshole

36
00:01:56.621 --> 00:01:59.740
would love just sudsy love.
Uh,

37
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.220
for us it like seems gross that you would clean your asshole that way.

38
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.810
<v 3>And it seems like the more you think about it,</v>

39
00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:08.320
it seems like the Japanese people are clean,
not only for their ass,

40
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.370
<v 2>whole city seemed clean,
like they seem like really clean,
very clean,</v>

41
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.630
but just the fact that that technology exists.
Yeah.
Everyone should be using it.

42
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.660
Why aren't we using it?
Yeah,
it's ridiculous.
Every home should have one of these,

43
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.300
you know,
instead of having a big TV,
you should have something that really,

44
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.330
really cleans your ass.
If it came down to that choice,
either one,

45
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.940
I would say get your ass clean first and save up for a TV.

46
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.000
<v 3>And it wasn't just like expense or rich people like the,</v>

47
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.850
the bathrooms and all the places we went to head that.

48
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.390
<v 2>Yeah.
So it's just standard.
It's normal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Either way they're smart.</v>

49
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.490
They mean they figured out a lot of things.
You know,

50
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.090
they're such incredible innovators.
I love Japan now.
Amazing place.

51
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.000
Fascinating place man.
When it comes to like the way they behave and how the PR,

52
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.850
how polite they are.
So for a lot of people,
like the vibe of it is so like,
uh,

53
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.470
so like more so much more toned down than America and American behavior.

54
00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:00.430
Like for a lot of people it's like,
wow,
this place feels really good.

55
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.460
It's nice to know that everywhere you go,
generally speaking,

56
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:07.670
most people are very polite,
you know,
it's unusual,
you know?
Yeah.

57
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.070
Even security at the arena.
So polite and so nice

58
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.240
<v 3>in a one,
one weird thing that somebody said to me,
I want to say who it was,</v>

59
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:20.080
but he,
he,
he,
he goes to Japan,
I lie.
And he said,
you know,

60
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.550
the sad thing is,

61
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:26.290
is that if you really wanted to hook up with any girl that you meet here,

62
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.660
all you have to do is tell him like,

63
00:03:27.661 --> 00:03:32.620
like you're friends with like lady Gaga or something like that.
And no one lies.

64
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.560
Like most people don't lie in Japan,
so they're not used to it.

65
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.000
And so they'll believe you.
They automatically believe you.
And like,

66
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.380
and then he said that third leg,
less people lie there.
Yeah.

67
00:03:43.381 --> 00:03:47.470
So statistically Google thing,
that's what he said.
He said,
that's how the,

68
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.660
there they are the,
that they're,

69
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:53.440
those people are that they're very innocent people and they don't like,

70
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.730
and then they're also very pushed over.
He said like,

71
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.870
like he would order something from the front desk and they're like,
sorry,

72
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.890
you know,
the chef went home and stuff like that goes,
no,
I want this and the rex.

73
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.150
Uh,
okay,
uh,
can,
can you come downstairs and pick it up?
And then he'll be like,
no,

74
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.960
you're bringing it to my room.
And it was really weird.

75
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:15.760
Like he was saying like how,
how it's kind of sad that,
that they,
uh,
they,

76
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.290
how nice they are and what they did to that food for gum.
Oh yeah.

77
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.660
Oh yeah,
yeah.
They put it up.

78
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.950
<v 2>Hi.
Mole's the draw their asshole offer,
but you're fucking food.
Yeah.
Ooh.</v>

79
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.220
<v 3>But it did seem like that,
it seemed like everywhere you went,</v>

80
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:34.170
everyone was just insanely nice,
like super innocent and Nice,

81
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.360
very

82
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.320
<v 2>polite people there.
It was,
it's an interesting culture.
You know,</v>

83
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:42.710
when you think about what Japan went through for a long time,

84
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:46.280
when they had like Ronins and when they were the sale essentially it went

85
00:04:46.281 --> 00:04:49.070
through a long period of like civil war.
You know,

86
00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:50.900
they went through a lot of crazy shit.

87
00:04:50.901 --> 00:04:53.900
And the fact that it's the birthplace of martial arts for the most part,

88
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.260
like the,
the early successful martial arts,
the core,

89
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.590
the core components of mixed martial arts.
Uh,
three of them come from Japan.
Yeah.

90
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.490
Judo,
karate and Jujitsu all come from Japan.
I mean,
it's really amazing.

91
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:08.301
I mean,
did they fade?

92
00:05:08.301 --> 00:05:12.170
They figured out how the science of launching people through the air with their

93
00:05:12.171 --> 00:05:14.330
bodies and slamming him on the ground.
I mean,

94
00:05:14.331 --> 00:05:16.220
judo for a lot of people don't like,

95
00:05:16.221 --> 00:05:18.890
you've never watched it and they don't have an appreciation for it.

96
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.340
The watching the intricacies of the moves and people like hoist each other

97
00:05:22.341 --> 00:05:25.850
through the fucking air,
slam each other on their back.
It's amazing to watch.

98
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:26.720
It's a crazy,

99
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.590
I mean they're really technical thing that they figured out how to do like all

100
00:05:30.591 --> 00:05:32.810
the shit they remember.
Like you'd watch like an old,

101
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.680
like a Batman movie where a guy could just flip a due to the air boom.

102
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.430
Well a real judo guy can do that.
They really can grow.

103
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.700
If you're wearing like a winter coat and you get in an argument with a judo guy,

104
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.210
like you're fuck that guy's going to hoist Jude's through the air by your jacket

105
00:05:47.211 --> 00:05:50.690
and slam you in the head.
You know,
it's a,
it's a crazy martial art.

106
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.360
And that emanated from Japan.
They figured that out.

107
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.280
They figured out kicking like,
like all the straight kicks from Japan.

108
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.040
I believe like a karate style kicks,
you know,
the,

109
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.970
the Koreans like revamped a lot of shit and in my opinion made a lot of

110
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:08.090
techniques better.
They put a little bit more power to it,

111
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:11.030
but they can't deny that karate is like,
you know,

112
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.110
one of the core tenants of,
of martial arts.
I mean it's a,

113
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:16.100
it's a good thing to learn.

114
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:19.910
There's a lot of good techniques and karate came from Japan.
You know,

115
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:23.150
it's a Ma Jujitsu,
you know,
w what,
what originally,
you know,

116
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:26.450
became Brazilian Jujitsu,
started off as you know,

117
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:30.080
Japanese judo and Japanese judo submissions.
It's amazing.

118
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:31.870
All that shit comes from Japan,
you know?

119
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.120
I mean people have innovated it and then changed it a bit,
but the,

120
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:38.810
the core idea of it,
trying to figure out how to strangle people on the ground,

121
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.930
all that shit came from Japan.
All those submissions and armbars.

122
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.930
It's amazing how much shit came from there.
Yeah.

123
00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.690
<v 3>And yet that they [inaudible] UFC was kind of interesting seeing people that</v>

124
00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:54.000
were from Japan that were big and pride and stuff like that.

125
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.540
Then fighting Americans and seeing what the outcome was.
It was kind of shocking.

126
00:06:57.541 --> 00:07:00.810
I was,
there was a couple that was one of the most amazing UFC,

127
00:07:00.811 --> 00:07:01.630
so it's an amazing,

128
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.900
<v 2>yeah,
I think,
yeah.
Yeah.
There was,</v>

129
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.530
there was a lot of guys who got the guy who beat kid Yamamoto.

130
00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:11.080
A is not from a America though.
Oh,
I'm going to,

131
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.780
I'll look up his name because it was important

132
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.190
<v 3>by the way.
He did,
what's his name?
Yama Mota.</v>

133
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.660
He looked like a video game character his back and his muscles were insane.

134
00:07:21.301 --> 00:07:24.320
That was that.
It looks you're saying live Akiyama Akiyama that's all right.

135
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.030
You raise
no,
but he looks like a video game player.

136
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.190
I was waiting for him to fly.
Start shooting fireballs out of his hands.

137
00:07:32.191 --> 00:07:33.750
Like street fighter.
Yeah.

138
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.260
He's a bad motherfucker and he's a bad motherfucker like a musician,
right?

139
00:07:37.261 --> 00:07:41.700
He sells out arenas like for his music and stuff.
Have you heard his music right?

140
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.520
<v 2>Yeah.
Well I've,
I've watched him sing on a,</v>

141
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.330
on a youtube clip and this is like fucking 30,000 people.
It's nuts.

142
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.480
It's like boy band type shit.
Really?
It's amazing dude.

143
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.320
<v 3>Is it like that,
that,
that fun Japanese like okay.</v>

144
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.400
<v 2>Yep.
Von [inaudible] was the gentleman that fought kid Yamamoto.</v>

145
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.660
Von [inaudible] was the,
uh,
he's not from America.
He's,
I believe he's England.

146
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.620
I should probably check that real quick cause I don't want to give some country

147
00:08:05.621 --> 00:08:09.490
credit for this guy.
But he submitted kid Yamamoto Melatonin.
It was,
fuck yeah.

148
00:08:09.491 --> 00:08:12.220
Birmingham,
Birmingham,
England.
There you go.
Well,
von Lee.
Yah,

149
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.450
he submitted kid Yamamoto after.
It was a wild ass fucking fight.

150
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.710
Kid Yamamoto clipped him at one point in time and he clipped Kent Yama Motel.

151
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:21.880
When kitty are clipped him,

152
00:08:21.881 --> 00:08:25.960
he like stayed real calm and composed and kid Yamamoto was like jumping all over

153
00:08:25.961 --> 00:08:29.470
him and the kid kept it together.
And then,
uh,
uh,
von Lee,
uh,

154
00:08:29.471 --> 00:08:33.670
eventually it went down to the ground and von Lee went form a triangle to an arm

155
00:08:33.671 --> 00:08:38.500
bar submission,
a chain.
It was fucking beautiful man.
The way he hit it was like,

156
00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:41.110
it was so tight and kid Yamato,
first of all,

157
00:08:41.111 --> 00:08:44.130
he's struggling from the triangle struggling from the triangle and the Judaizers

158
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.840
vap just flipped it over and switched it.
Nice.

159
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.410
Really got his hips deep into it and finished that arm bar.
I was like,
wow,

160
00:08:50.411 --> 00:08:54.670
that kid is fucking bad ass.
And I'd seen him fight one other time in the UFC,

161
00:08:54.671 --> 00:08:58.410
but that kid Yamamoto people don't understand what a killer that guy used to be.

162
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:03.660
He was.
He knocked out,
I think it was cow uno and the boiler Gracie in one night.

163
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.800
He knocked out both of them.
He was,
uh,
in his prime.

164
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:12.300
He was a beast,
you know,
but I don't know.
Maybe it's the,
I don't know.

165
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:16.620
Either he has declined to bid or the sport has passed him by.

166
00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:19.360
I don't know what it is but he can't seem to.
But the other guy was what?

167
00:09:19.361 --> 00:09:23.160
Victory 34 and he was 38 or something like that.
Or an age difference.

168
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:27.030
I think he's only 34 I think kid Yamato's 34 which is still leaves them in his

169
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:31.320
athletic prime.
Right.
You're like Anderson is a 37 I believe.

170
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.060
And you know Anderson's son,
the fucking absolute,
his prime,
you know.
But it's,

171
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.010
it's also like as you get older,
like the good fighters,

172
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:40.020
the really technical fighters like Anderson,

173
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.320
like they just get better because they're,
everything is based on technique.

174
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:45.570
As long as they keep their fitness up and they have good discipline,

175
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:49.530
which Anderson does,
you know,
like Bernard Hopkins,
the same,
same thing.

176
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.610
They can compete like well,
well,
well into their forties where,
you know,

177
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:57.390
so Anderson is like in his fucking prime right now in my opinion,

178
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.280
37 years old is not the same as 37 years was just like 10 or 20 years ago.

179
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.180
A guy like him is,
you know,
might take them a little longer to read,

180
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.090
to heal from shit,

181
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:09.660
but the way he can move and the wake and performance pretty fucking and past

182
00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:14.460
energy and like I could get hurt in the past or something like that.

183
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.440
What's that?
Did he get hurt in the past and I can knock out?
No,
no,

184
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.020
he's never been knocked out.
And he's been a,

185
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.260
he's been stopped in fights by submissions.
He,
um,
tried to say injury back,

186
00:10:24.261 --> 00:10:25.094
couldn't say sir.

187
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.950
He's been tapped a couple of times once when he was younger in his career and

188
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:31.200
another time,
um,
by Rio,
Shona and,

189
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:35.700
and one of the most spectacular a submission attacks ever.
He dove on,

190
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:39.720
I'm like pro wrestling style in a flying scissors.
Hold,
caught him by the legs,

191
00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:43.230
took him to the ground and got him in a heel hook like that.
It was amazing.

192
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.140
I mean it was like one of the most beautiful,

193
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:48.990
like almost like it looks fake submission attempts ever.

194
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:53.440
And especially considering he did it on Anderson Silva,
you know,
so Anderson's,

195
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.540
he's a human,
he's just the best,
you know,
he's human,

196
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.990
but he's the best.
So you didn't rewatch the,
that,
that,
no,

197
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.900
I haven't watched him fight.
A lot of people think that a Frankie Edgar,

198
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:11.400
um,
one at three rounds to two rounds,
um,
when,
when it was over,

199
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.780
I was pretty sure that Henderson had probably gotten a decision.

200
00:11:15.781 --> 00:11:20.420
But man,
it's hard to tell sometimes what other people are seeing.
And uh,

201
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.990
I really believe it.
Sometimes the best view is from the Monitor,

202
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.890
you know,
cause sometimes I'm looking up and you know,

203
00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:33.450
where our heads are basically where the fighters feed our ad,
you know,
and,
um,

204
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.140
we're,
we're looking up and it's,
I mean,
it's the perfect view really.
I mean,

205
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:39.180
it's an amazing fucking place to watch a fight,

206
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.430
but to be like super critical about a fight.

207
00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:45.490
I always wonder if maybe the best way to do it would be debt,
you know,
to,

208
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.440
to be able to watch the television screen.
Right.
You know,

209
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.900
I mean it sounds ridiculous because you want to watch it live,

210
00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:55.720
but like there's a cage in your,
you know,
there's posts in your way sometimes.

211
00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:57.730
Like sometimes because of the,
the cage,

212
00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:00.820
I miss shit that's like really critical in a fight.

213
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.710
Like Roy Nelson took this giant swing at Barbary silver dome and virgin got his

214
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:08.110
back like that.
And I don't know what happened.
I don't know how he went.

215
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:09.730
I had to go back and watch it in the,

216
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:14.170
and the replays to see how a resale got his back because while it was happening,

217
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:16.870
it all took place behind a pole.
So it's like you,

218
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.630
you see it happen and then you got to look down and by the time he looked down,

219
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:24.310
man,
Fabrizio is such a fucking Ninja.
He had taken that guy's back so quickly.

220
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.443
It was incredible.

221
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.840
And that that's like one of those fights where you see how legit Roy Nelson is

222
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:33.130
too because Roy Nelson like survived have for resale for doom on his back.

223
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:33.990
You know,

224
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.260
<v 3>I also think there should be certain fights where you look at the final outcome</v>

225
00:12:37.261 --> 00:12:39.170
of them,
the person himself and eat.

226
00:12:39.171 --> 00:12:41.700
Like I saw the press conference like afterwards and they,

227
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.200
there was like somebody compared the photos of Henderson and him and like,

228
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.680
you know,
after the fight and just looking at the faces,

229
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:54.250
you look at look at that and if it's still going on here and like that,

230
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.690
that looks horrible.
I think you know there's is,
here's the thing,

231
00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:01.380
there's a thing called fight metric.
Okay.
And the fight metric is a,
you know,

232
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.380
the idea of there's a bunch of different versions of it.
Kill your fucking cat.

233
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.800
Well yeah,
you kind of going off,
um,

234
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.830
there's a bunch of different versions of it that's not a real cat.

235
00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:13.440
We're talking about an electronic check in case I have canceled

236
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.690
<v 2>Jesus Christ completely throw me off.</v>

237
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.340
<v 3>We've even talking about scoring something,
scoring like,
like,</v>

238
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:29.080
like I hope you were saying something like,
like,
like damn,
it goes like this.

239
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.440
Like if I go like this,
this counts,
right?
This is point,
point,
point,
point,
point.

240
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.230
Think no,
it should be the same.
Again,
strikes,

241
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.130
<v 2>differences.
One guy,</v>

242
00:13:37.131 --> 00:13:41.300
significant strikes do not equal the amount of damage done by the other guy.

243
00:13:41.301 --> 00:13:42.170
Significant strikes.

244
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:47.530
So if one guy is a power puncher and he's landing super clean and the other guy

245
00:13:48.351 --> 00:13:52.010
doesn't hit as hard and he's not quite landing as clean or not quite landing as

246
00:13:52.011 --> 00:13:55.670
hard,
the guy who hits your harder is the one is really ultimately winning.

247
00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:00.260
And when you look at like how many punches were landed,
you know,

248
00:14:00.261 --> 00:14:04.760
and how many strikes were landed?
Man,
you know,
I bet Frankie Edgar lender,

249
00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:08.500
a lot of solid strikes,
but he never seemed to like really rock them.
He never,

250
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.640
there was one time when he knocked him down with a right hand,

251
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.850
but Henderson that was at the end of the fight where Henderson want him getting

252
00:14:13.851 --> 00:14:16.620
on top and he was,
he was pounding on him at the end.
Remember.
Right.

253
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.020
So it was like,
you know,
he had done,
I mean,

254
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:24.590
I think that a Frankie Edgar had done a lot.
It's,
it's conceivable that he,

255
00:14:24.591 --> 00:14:29.030
you know,
easily people watching it at home could have thought that he won.
Um,

256
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.210
just by virtue of the fact that,
you know,
it's an amazing thing,

257
00:14:32.211 --> 00:14:35.000
but he always does.
He gets hurt and he comes back and he can't stop.

258
00:14:35.001 --> 00:14:37.670
The guy's hard.
I mean,
it's really a,
you root for the guy.

259
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.800
That's absolutely for sure.
You know,

260
00:14:39.801 --> 00:14:43.460
Frankie Edgar has the biggest heart of any fighter I've ever seen fight ever.

261
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:47.270
That guy has zero quit in him and there's a lot of people who would have taken

262
00:14:47.271 --> 00:14:48.950
their check and fucking,
you know,

263
00:14:48.951 --> 00:14:52.100
there's a few shots that he's taken where a of people would've have been like,

264
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:53.480
you know,
and I don't think I can go on,

265
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.930
but that dude always finds a way to go on.
Not just go on,

266
00:14:56.931 --> 00:15:00.200
but he seems to go after you right after you do that to him and he wants to get

267
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:02.810
you,
you know,
he's unbelievably competitive,

268
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.920
but that other dude did a lot more damage.
That's,
that's for sure.
He,

269
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:10.640
that Ben Henderson is a really,
really good fighter.

270
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.180
It's not just that Ben Henderson was bigger than him.
It's Benson.

271
00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:18.800
Henderson is really good at almost everything.
His,
his Jujitsu's nasty,

272
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:22.820
his wrestling's nasty.
He's super strong.
He's always in great condition.

273
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.190
He can fucking kick like Bruce Lee,

274
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.910
that crazy shit he did when Frankie Edwards grabbing his foot and he jumped up

275
00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:32.630
in the air and swung that foot over his head.
That was wild.
I mean,

276
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:35.510
that's a matrix shit,
you know.
I mean,
the only reason,
I mean,

277
00:15:35.511 --> 00:15:39.440
what would have happened if that thing landed,
I mean,
Frankie Edgar is sell fast.

278
00:15:39.441 --> 00:15:41.870
It's hard to catch him with anything like that.
I mean he's just,

279
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.650
especially in the early rounds,
that dude moves like,
you know,
he,

280
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.570
he moves like nobody else in the business

281
00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.360
<v 3>I got to sit at have really awesome seats.
Thank you so much.</v>

282
00:15:51.361 --> 00:15:54.210
I mean it was so amazing.
I have to sit right behind Joe.

283
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:58.920
But one thing I was so amazed by it was that the photographer that UFC

284
00:15:58.921 --> 00:16:01.920
photographer,
he said,
I don't know if he does every single UFC,

285
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:05.430
but just watching him work like he has like this,
like a camera on both sides.

286
00:16:05.431 --> 00:16:09.860
He's just double like 0.1,
like a gun superfast Josh the shot together.

287
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:14.550
Look at that shot.
That is just fucking amazing.
He got that perfect.

288
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.080
Eh,
I,
I'm just amazed by his work.
Uh,

289
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.430
just watching him work and everything was that,
that,

290
00:16:20.431 --> 00:16:24.150
that it was so quiet in Japan because everyone's being as polite except there

291
00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:27.750
was some like English people here and there that was like screaming and making

292
00:16:27.751 --> 00:16:31.440
al noises.
And stuff,
but it was awesome hearing the fight sounds.

293
00:16:31.441 --> 00:16:33.200
That's one thing that,
that uh,

294
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:35.940
I think not many people have probably got to experience,

295
00:16:35.941 --> 00:16:39.990
but hearing it in Japan where it's super quiet and hearing those punches,

296
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.580
that was scary almost.

297
00:16:41.581 --> 00:16:45.420
That was like monster in the woods because it was like you could feel how

298
00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:48.020
horrible that would have felt if that happened to yourself.
Whoa.

299
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.500
<v 2>Things are always better when people around you shut the fuck up and just enjoy</v>

300
00:16:51.501 --> 00:16:53.780
the things.
But most people when they get to a crowd,

301
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.450
they just want to yell and scream and sometime that's awesome.

302
00:16:56.451 --> 00:16:57.050
Sometimes it didn't.

303
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.240
It enhances a fight when you're around people in everybody's screaming and

304
00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:00.170
something crazy is going on.

305
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.380
Faded enhances me when I'm watching a fight and I'm around a bunch of people

306
00:17:03.381 --> 00:17:06.520
going,
Oh shit.
Oh Shit.
To me that's like,
it makes it crazy.

307
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:09.230
It makes it so there is something to that.

308
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:12.420
<v 3>Would you prefer it to be quiet,
like the Japanese style?</v>

309
00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.050
I think that would be my ideal.
Pretty

310
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.110
<v 2>bad ass.
It is pretty bad ass.
I went to see a that band honey honey last night.</v>

311
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:22.100
Oh yeah.
How was that?
There were awesome.
Um,
but one of the things that it was,

312
00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:24.710
I mean,
they were really,
they're really,
you're in love with really good.

313
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.130
They're really fucking good man.
So,
um,

314
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.970
one of the things it was weird though was that it was in a crowd where,
uh,

315
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:30.321
you know,

316
00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:32.960
a bunch of people sitting around drinking and they're watching music and some

317
00:17:32.961 --> 00:17:37.820
people were just having full on like yelling conversations with themselves,

318
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.790
with each other,
you know,
while this band was playing.

319
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:45.170
And then then some songs,
everyone,
one would shut the fuck up.

320
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:49.970
And it was amazing.
It was like,
you know,
there was some like really good about,

321
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.860
<v 4>it's not even that man,
it wasn't that those were the good songs.</v>

322
00:17:52.861 --> 00:17:54.960
It was like you just catch them when they're done talk out.
Right.

323
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.260
Because people just get tired of talking about shit,
but they,

324
00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.850
bands don't seem to mind like they seem,

325
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.600
it seems to be okay to talk in certain settings.

326
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:06.450
I'm sure it's just like practice round,
you know,
that's like there.

327
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.680
They like that kind of where they can kind of play around a little more than

328
00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:13.890
normal.
We're in instead of going like on tour.
They,

329
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.660
I mean did you see them in like a huge set?
Oh No,
no.

330
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.080
It was a really intimate environment.
It was really intimate.

331
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.410
There's probably like their open mind.
Yeah,
well for sure that,

332
00:18:22.411 --> 00:18:24.510
well I don't think it was an open,
I mean everyone was there to see them,

333
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.400
but it was,

334
00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.100
it was like some free show that they were doing and they had to do it under an

335
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:32.130
assumed name.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Kind of funky.
It was like,

336
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:36.510
I don't think I have some things in El coming off so they can promote it.

337
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.170
You know,
like what does that thing up in Indio,
Coachella.
Oh yeah,

338
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.470
that's what they're on that.
So like I said,
no,

339
00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:47.520
I forgot what it was.
I not,
yes.
Yeah.
They haven't announced it yet.

340
00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.350
What are you talking about?
It's online.
Fuck you dare you.

341
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.830
No one who would care anyway,
I just got the scoop.

342
00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:02.180
Why would,
why is it bad to know about something early and Holy Shit,
it got out.

343
00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.480
She got out early,
especially in the case of something like that.

344
00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:09.210
Someone put insider trading probably,
but they were,
um,

345
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.680
there were some songs where no one talked at all and you know,

346
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.610
it was fucking incredible.
It's amazing.

347
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:19.080
Live music is so different than live comedy.
It's so inspirational.

348
00:19:19.081 --> 00:19:22.140
It's so inspirational to go and see something that someone's doing this

349
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:25.260
completely different than anything that you do,
but it's still performing.

350
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.160
You know?
I really enjoy the shit out of it.
I don't get a chance to do it.

351
00:19:29.161 --> 00:19:33.480
Fuck that.
I don't start taking guitar lessons time.
I have no time.

352
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.450
Certain Guitar and then you don't have to leave your family.

353
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:41.670
Nobody would Jujitsu.
You want a world where no one I know protect themselves.

354
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:45.860
Everyone's a big ball of Jello.
Someday it will happen that you will be like,

355
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:50.140
Brian,
I'm not doing Jujitsu anymore.
We wanted to live with Marissa said setback.

356
00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.530
Uh,
why,
why would I stop doing Jujitsu?

357
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.660
Because you're like throw your hip out cause you're 80 or something and be like,

358
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.700
I got to stop this.

359
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:03.450
Well when that happens I'll definitely stop.
So what would you say I would do?

360
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.640
I know,
what am I supposed to do after that?
I don't remember.
I got too stoned.

361
00:20:06.641 --> 00:20:08.730
Do that.
That fucking weep before you even got here,

362
00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:11.670
he was like well smoke and so we've been smoking and now I'm just,

363
00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.910
I'm pretty much gone.
Yeah,
be real with site from Cypress Hill.

364
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.050
Just smoked pot with us.

365
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.000
I want to get him and Doug Benson together and just see like how that podcast

366
00:20:21.001 --> 00:20:25.290
goes.
He seems to handle it really well.
Be Real.

367
00:20:25.291 --> 00:20:26.310
Did I mean he just like,

368
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.590
he never like fades or gets weird or you know he's a,
he's a really nice guy,

369
00:20:31.591 --> 00:20:34.710
man.
Always been a really nice guy.
Just always has a good vibe around them.

370
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.590
Can have sex that he couldn't stay longer cause I wanted to hear like I wanted

371
00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:40.800
to know,
I heard there was some weird stuff with him and Everlast at one point.

372
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.320
Oh really?
Was there.
Oh,
don't go to TMZ and all.
I think they,

373
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.760
I think their friends now.
I think there's just like old long,

374
00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.970
I will then don't bring it up.
Let me go find out about it online.
You know,

375
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.090
who knows why you leave something,
you know,

376
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.830
people still send me negative Mencias a shit dice come at,
they sent me a text.

377
00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.430
I'll read diocese text.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What,
what happened there?

378
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.150
I'll tell you right now.
No,
he's not mad at me.
Oh,
I love ties.

379
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.970
I dice is one of those guys.
I don't care how,

380
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.170
how crazy you say dices,
you know,
and you know,

381
00:21:11.171 --> 00:21:15.190
I don't care how much people say like,
Oh,
you know,
sometimes he's a jerk.

382
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:19.420
He won't take pigs.
What lesson?
In my book there's only a few comedy deities.

383
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.140
It's only few of them.
George Carlin's not around,
but die still is.

384
00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.440
And it sounds ridiculous,
but when I was a kid,
man,
when,
when,

385
00:21:26.441 --> 00:21:30.970
when dice clay first started blowing up dice clay to me was like,
you know,

386
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.190
I mean,
it's not the most complicated comedy in the world.

387
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.890
The shit was hilarious.
Well,
we were kids.

388
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:42.480
There's no denying the funny that was in,
you know,
a dice clay album,

389
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.710
you know those,
uh,
those,
those first ones,
I w I listened to them on cassette.

390
00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.410
God Damn.
They were good.
They were hilarious.

391
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.470
And who you would like stop your car parked and everyone in the car would be

392
00:21:52.471 --> 00:21:57.360
fucking a howling listening to the cassette.
So this is what he says.

393
00:21:58.550 --> 00:21:59.260
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

394
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.580
<v 4>Sorry.
I,
this is the first fucking text ice has ever sent me.</v>

395
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:07.500
So Cock sucker MNC now stills Titus food specials.

396
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:12.630
Carlos rules.
Yes.

397
00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:16.110
The pay and trust me,
he will.
By the way,

398
00:22:16.111 --> 00:22:20.970
this is dyce hope.
Good doing good.
That's the tags.

399
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.390
That's awesome to me to get a text like that from dice clay.

400
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.380
That is a fucking honor.
That to me is an honor.
That's awesome.

401
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.770
The first text I ever got from dice club,
that's really cool.

402
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.690
You should print it out.
I love that guy.
When I was a kid,

403
00:22:36.691 --> 00:22:40.080
man,
I fucking thought that was the funniest shit I've ever heard in my life.

404
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:44.960
And I told you when,
uh,
when we've talked about it with,
um,
uh,

405
00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:49.360
who was on which,
which show wasn't on when we talked about the DYFS thing.
Oh,
uh,

406
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:53.190
oh,
Amy Schumer.
Schumer.
Yes.
It was right.
Yeah,
for sure.
She's a fan.
Of course.

407
00:22:53.191 --> 00:22:55.380
She was so cool dude.
That was one of my favorite part.
It was amazing.

408
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.350
And Amy Schumer was,
we were talking about the day the laughter died.

409
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.800
Well apparently a lot of people started buying it after we set it.
All right.

410
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.230
I got so many tweets saying how fucking funny is if you're like a real comedy

411
00:23:04.231 --> 00:23:08.610
fan and you want to see a guy go up and do two hours of just fucking around.

412
00:23:08.611 --> 00:23:10.860
I don't have,
I'm not trying to make any money off the day.
The laughter died,

413
00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:15.310
but it's God damn work of art.
But just buy it through doug.com now she's fine.

414
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.160
She's a fine.
Did you uh,

415
00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:21.510
a email inform you when you got back that you would've been making emails from

416
00:23:21.511 --> 00:23:26.050
Japan?
No.
What are you talking about?
Um,

417
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:31.590
I have some sophistication set up behind my email so that it lets me know if

418
00:23:31.591 --> 00:23:36.380
somebody hacks into my shit.
Try to email somewhere.
I was like,

419
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.300
listen man,
someone's tapped in new shit in Japan.

420
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.950
I was really off the grid in Japan cause I was so scared that like that texts

421
00:23:43.951 --> 00:23:48.230
that you got on your phone that says,
you know,
one megabyte of data is 24 95.

422
00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:51.050
I'm like Oh nope.
No data,
turn off data.
You know,

423
00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:53.990
I didn't want to use my phone at all.
I was scared with text messages.

424
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.100
It's funny how they can do that.

425
00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:58.190
Just charge you a fuck load as if like what you're doing over there as more

426
00:23:58.191 --> 00:24:02.660
expensive.
Yeah.
It's all the same fucking network.
Just process it.

427
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:05.450
Can you guys just agree that it in the computer,

428
00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.960
can you agree that oh well someone comes over and uses our stuff.

429
00:24:08.961 --> 00:24:09.771
What's your rain?
Okay,

430
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:12.530
we'll accept your rate and you just pay what their normal rate is.

431
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.920
Not this wacky $5 a fucking megabyte bullshit.
Like,
when does that,

432
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.130
where are you coming up with that nobody's paying that much switch to an email

433
00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:22.100
based system where you don't have phone numbers anymore,
you just have emails,

434
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.330
you know like I want to call your email,
whatever.
You know what I mean?
Like,
like,

435
00:24:26.331 --> 00:24:30.560
like when we go overseas it was like zero Zeros or country code eight,
seven.

436
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:31.460
That's not the issue.

437
00:24:31.461 --> 00:24:34.970
The issue is you need a new service provider everywhere you tap in.
Yeah.

438
00:24:34.971 --> 00:24:37.480
It shouldn't be like the issue.
So you're,
you're saying is that the,

439
00:24:37.481 --> 00:24:41.090
it should be one universal with Skype provider for the whole world and that's

440
00:24:41.091 --> 00:24:45.010
how we talk to each other.
Like an email.
Skype is Skype,
right?

441
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:49.610
G mail chat.
Even then somebody has to provide the backbone for the Internet,

442
00:24:49.611 --> 00:24:53.900
right?
Yeah.
But it's already done and there's already the internet.

443
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.431
Yeah.
But to be able to,

444
00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:58.490
I mean what you're saying is you want the phone to be like that.

445
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.930
It should be based on Wifi or the Internet should be everywhere and it shouldn't

446
00:25:02.931 --> 00:25:05.630
be cellular signals anymore.
I don't know what I'm saying.

447
00:25:05.631 --> 00:25:08.390
Anymore dry and you're too high.
You know what I think,

448
00:25:08.391 --> 00:25:12.000
I think the government should have wifi towers and the that,

449
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.560
that the whole telephone system and everything like that should be based off

450
00:25:15.561 --> 00:25:19.610
like a government based.
You know like there,
there shouldn't be a t and t,

451
00:25:19.611 --> 00:25:23.540
there shouldn't be a,
you know the cell phone services.
It should just be all,

452
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.240
nevermind.
I don't know what I'm digging myself.
I know what you're saying.

453
00:25:26.241 --> 00:25:26.781
I know what he's saying.

454
00:25:26.781 --> 00:25:30.320
He's saying communication should all be really simple as yeah,
it should.

455
00:25:30.321 --> 00:25:31.700
It shouldn't have country codes.

456
00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:36.701
It shouldn't cost $24 if I'm on one side of this piece of water as the have to

457
00:25:37.311 --> 00:25:41.840
have like local people have to profit from the infrastructure,

458
00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.220
you know that that's set up right.

459
00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:48.140
So the people that have created it in Japan or whoever owns wherever you're at,

460
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.400
whoever owns the towers that display or the send out the information that you're

461
00:25:52.401 --> 00:25:56.390
riding on that you're roaming on.
Whoever built that shit and made investments,

462
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.930
I can understand why they would want a service fee.

463
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.740
I can understand like if you want to come over here and use our internet,

464
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.240
you can use it at our rate.

465
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:09.740
Plus you have to pay $25 you know like a 24 hour users fee.

466
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:14.150
Yeah,
but it was so ridiculous.
The one megabyte is 24 95 it is.

467
00:26:14.151 --> 00:26:15.140
But I mean if you pay,

468
00:26:15.141 --> 00:26:19.340
if you let people pay at a reasonable rate and then have that same exchange

469
00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:22.400
going on with their company so that if someone knows over in America and you're

470
00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:23.031
from overseas,

471
00:26:23.031 --> 00:26:26.930
you know you can use at and t and it won't be any more ridiculous for you to

472
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:27.201
yeah,

473
00:26:27.201 --> 00:26:31.250
but it shouldn't be like I accidentally sent you a photo by text message and it

474
00:26:31.251 --> 00:26:34.250
costs $250 and you know,

475
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.180
somebody sent me back one and it costs 125 and I couldn't say stop,

476
00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:41.660
don't want to have imaged automatically downloads that possible that it would

477
00:26:41.661 --> 00:26:45.960
cost that much money though.
24 95 a mega mega megabyte.

478
00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:50.580
A photo is like what,
three megabytes on an iPhone,
something like that.

479
00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.340
Like one of those android phones.
And the crazy cameras.
Yeah.

480
00:26:53.341 --> 00:26:57.060
It's something like that.
Have some like eight and 10 mega pixel camera phones.

481
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.830
Don't think.
Yeah,
that's amazing.

482
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:04.180
That's fucking iPad three March 7th I'm not ready.
I didn't even use the APP.

483
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:09.000
How to love the iPad one.
I liked the kindle.
You know,
I,
I,
you know,

484
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.910
laptops or a kindle.
You know what I like about the kindle,
man?

485
00:27:11.911 --> 00:27:14.610
I liked the way the paper looks.
I don't like the way it's not glossy.

486
00:27:14.611 --> 00:27:15.600
It looks like paper.

487
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.590
It's like that technology I think is really pretty fucking bad ass.

488
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.650
I don't use the IPAD for any of the ounce.
Maybe watching TV shows.

489
00:27:22.651 --> 00:27:23.484
It's good for that.

490
00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:26.450
It's good for when you're getting tattooed and he watched TV shows where he's

491
00:27:26.451 --> 00:27:26.860
saying that,

492
00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.690
<v 5>Eh,</v>

493
00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.630
<v 4>it helps the time go by and when someone's drilling in your arm,</v>

494
00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.990
I think surfing the net on it,
I think it's perfect.
Do you find that there's,

495
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.320
how many websites do you come across to her flash supported that you can act?
Oh,

496
00:27:38.321 --> 00:27:39.940
nowadays everything's iPad.

497
00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:45.840
I never run into switch over old comedians.
I bet a lot of flashlights.
Yeah,

498
00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.780
that's a good thing.
My shit was always flash based.
Yeah.

499
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:53.500
I didn't know the flash was at wonky.
Yeah,
it's always been kind of wonky.

500
00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:57.570
I mean like that's the problem we recover.
That's the problem with websites.
Like,

501
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.433
like we,

502
00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:03.450
I use wordpress for most of my shit nowadays because the reason being is it's

503
00:28:03.451 --> 00:28:07.770
just got to a point where like chrome war would work a certain way with html and

504
00:28:07.771 --> 00:28:09.550
like another browser we're working different way.

505
00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:12.190
So you would make a website for somebody and then,

506
00:28:12.191 --> 00:28:14.560
and then like different operating systems,

507
00:28:14.561 --> 00:28:17.050
like you'd log on the windows and then compare it to Mac.

508
00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:20.350
It's not the same like shit's all fucked up on the Mac version.

509
00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:24.040
So then you have to find out how to fix that.
And there's just too many browsers,

510
00:28:24.041 --> 00:28:25.150
too many operating systems.

511
00:28:25.151 --> 00:28:28.360
There's too many mobile devices that go on the Internet nowadays it seems like

512
00:28:28.361 --> 00:28:29.194
they've almost,

513
00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.370
nowadays you just want the most simplest thing like a wordpress or a blogger or

514
00:28:33.371 --> 00:28:35.800
even have it be something else.
Like a tumbler.

515
00:28:35.801 --> 00:28:40.060
You just have your dotcom link to a tumbler nowadays is just to make it easy.

516
00:28:40.061 --> 00:28:44.830
Let somebody else deal with all that fucking cross platform bullshit of design

517
00:28:44.831 --> 00:28:48.550
and stuff.
They ideas just to get your message out to people,
you know,
get your,

518
00:28:48.551 --> 00:28:49.270
you know,

519
00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:52.660
so you should [inaudible] dot com go to a tumbler site and that's what I'm

520
00:28:52.661 --> 00:28:57.550
almost thinking nowadays.
Tumbler really that popular.
Is that the Tumblr?
Yeah,

521
00:28:57.551 --> 00:29:02.190
Tumblr.
Tumblr probably could be the next Twitter thing.
Yeah,

522
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.510
you should.
You should definitely get a tumbler.

523
00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:08.170
And nowadays nowadays your tumbler just links to Twitter.
Sorry,

524
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.310
I used to write blog entries.
I should,
if I was going to Redo them,

525
00:29:12.311 --> 00:29:14.860
I should write them on Twitter or I read them on Tumblr or something like that.

526
00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.050
Yeah,
that's what I think nowadays it's,
cause I,

527
00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.840
I just spent a bunch of money for this,

528
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:24.730
like a wordpress stuff for desk squad and you know,
it's still,
it's,
it's buggy.

529
00:29:24.731 --> 00:29:25.570
It's fucked up.

530
00:29:25.571 --> 00:29:29.710
Like I tried it and like a different browser and it was a little bit off then I

531
00:29:29.711 --> 00:29:33.760
wanted it.
I'm like,
you know,
this is stupid.
Why if I,
why do I go to like,

532
00:29:33.761 --> 00:29:38.080
you know,
like a,
a live journal.com our Facebook,

533
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.030
it pretty much works exactly the same model.
Like what you're,

534
00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:46.130
are you thinking as long as it was set up somewhere where it's preserved in case

535
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:49.510
like tumbler gets hit with some crazy virus or some bullshit,

536
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.200
like all your stuff,
they're all backed up so well nowadays.
Yeah.

537
00:29:53.201 --> 00:29:56.980
Cause it's almost like a reliability that is it possible that you could have it

538
00:29:56.981 --> 00:30:00.490
like that where you know you would have your site update,
um,

539
00:30:00.491 --> 00:30:03.370
when you update your site it updates your tumbler as well.
Yeah.

540
00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:05.830
I mean I think you should,
you could store it.
Yeah.

541
00:30:05.831 --> 00:30:09.050
I think like linking it to your Twitter,
linking it to your Facebook,

542
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.360
make it so you just do it one.

543
00:30:10.361 --> 00:30:14.780
But it does separate branch off to all the different things.
What if,
um,

544
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:18.760
when you go to my site,
there's two options.
One branches you off to the Tumbler,

545
00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:22.630
the other branches,
you're off to podcast.
Now you can do that.

546
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.350
You might not be a good,
a bad idea.
No,
no.

547
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:29.030
You can do that all you want your website to be as a pretty much a bookmark for

548
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.690
with all your different links.
Like here's your Twitter,
here's your Tumblr,

549
00:30:31.691 --> 00:30:34.990
here's you have it all be like,

550
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.620
I definitely think that I could do something cool with my website.

551
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.470
I know I need to make it easier to find my old writing.

552
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.820
I got to figure out a better,

553
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:47.870
you know you needed to do to take all that shit and go to a tumbler and re blog

554
00:30:49.061 --> 00:30:53.770
it for you.
You know,
I mean five time consuming is the tumbler,

555
00:30:53.771 --> 00:30:57.970
is it really that sphere?
Is it really that good to do?
Yeah,

556
00:30:57.971 --> 00:31:00.840
but you could cut and paste that into four different things.
You know,

557
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.580
you can cut paste it onto your Facebook page,
you can cut,

558
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:07.300
put it on your a tumbler,
you can put,
but it's the idea,

559
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:11.320
the idea that I'm in doing it like that or you do it and do some big public

560
00:31:11.321 --> 00:31:13.090
platform like some my space type thing.

561
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.240
They you're just going to get a lot more eyes on it.
Yeah,
more community,

562
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.440
definitely more community.

563
00:31:17.441 --> 00:31:21.790
And the other option is that keeps you from having to worry about bullshit.
Yeah,

564
00:31:21.791 --> 00:31:24.310
exactly.
Seitzer how seeing it.
Yeah.

565
00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:27.550
Because I have a sites I go to in safari and then I go to them and chrome,

566
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:28.840
they're totally different.
Yeah.

567
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:33.110
It's just a pain in the ass to maintain that little frames.
Yeah.

568
00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.690
And you have to move the frames around.

569
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.210
A lot of people spend a lot of money on web designers.

570
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:42.100
They design like an awesome website.
A year later there's a new update and flash,

571
00:31:42.101 --> 00:31:45.250
there's an update and something that throws off the coding a little bit.

572
00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:48.550
So you have to have somebody maintain it all the time.
It's a pain in the ass.

573
00:31:48.551 --> 00:31:52.630
Let somebody else do that now.
I mean,
if it's about getting a blog out,
why,

574
00:31:52.631 --> 00:31:56.080
why not have a community of,
people are like,
you know that smart,

575
00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:58.990
but I just don't trust it.
Someone's going to try to sell iPads from it.

576
00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.520
They can already do that.
Somebody got hacked.
Oh my Goldberg got hacked.

577
00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.753
Some of the,
uh,

578
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.590
hacked into his shit and was trying to sell something you said hacked or hacked?

579
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.560
His Twitter got hacked.
My aunt got hacked to Mike.
Yeah,

580
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:15.190
Mike got Hacked twice in a row or something like that on Twitter.
Did he really?

581
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.400
That's funny.
By his daughter.

582
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:22.740
[inaudible] daughter goes and takes his tweets towel.
Really?
Yeah.

583
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:26.410
That's hilarious.
People,
man.
I told them,
don't get mad.
They're just Satan.

584
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.370
He'll get down there and fight with them.
You know,

585
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.920
my Kohlberg's doesn't want to take any bullshit from people and he'll get mad.

586
00:32:32.921 --> 00:32:35.350
Maybe he's got a cocktail in them.
You sons of bitches.

587
00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:38.470
Hardy had a lot with Mike Boeck Goldberger over the weekend.
He's a good dude.

588
00:32:38.471 --> 00:32:39.980
That was a good,
he's a very good

589
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.740
<v 2>dude.
He's a,
you know,</v>

590
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.230
Mike Goldberg spin around sports like his whole fucking life.

591
00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:48.100
He's always been around savages.
You know,
his whole life he's been,

592
00:32:48.101 --> 00:32:51.440
I don't like hockey players and animals.
It's just a fun guy.

593
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.000
Fun Guy to be around.
Yeah.
Japan.

594
00:32:56.001 --> 00:33:00.260
It was a fucking great time,
man.
That was a really interesting culture.

595
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.110
You know what I'm getting sick of,
man.
How come I can't joy something.

596
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:06.260
We were talking about how Brazil was beautiful and amazing and talking about how

597
00:33:06.261 --> 00:33:09.640
much I enjoy Japan.
I get these fucking emails from people go years,

598
00:33:09.641 --> 00:33:14.250
you look too much.
Why don't you fucking move there?
I would move that,
not email,

599
00:33:14.251 --> 00:33:18.560
excuse me,
Twitter messages.
I've gotten only Twitter messages.
It's so silly.

600
00:33:18.561 --> 00:33:22.160
How can we can't just enjoy certain aspects of another country.

601
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.650
I'm not saying that Japan is better than America.

602
00:33:24.651 --> 00:33:28.640
I definitely enjoy America more than Japan.
There's some things about Japan.

603
00:33:28.641 --> 00:33:29.474
I didn't alike,

604
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:32.660
but I didn't like the fact that had to cover up my tattoos when I went to
places.

605
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.690
Yeah.
When I went to the gym,
they made me cover up my tattoos.

606
00:33:35.691 --> 00:33:38.840
They actually gave me a shirt to wear.
Why is that?
And sleep shirt?

607
00:33:38.841 --> 00:33:41.520
Because they have a yakuza thing.
Jeff Current,

608
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.660
one of the guys were fights in the UFC,
said he was on Twitter.

609
00:33:44.661 --> 00:33:49.430
He said he was doing squats and a lady came over and started taping up a tattoo

610
00:33:49.431 --> 00:33:53.230
on his leg in the middle of his squatting.
She's like wrapping his,

611
00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:56.900
his tattoo up while he's squatting.
Why?
What was the reason it's covered?

612
00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.910
No,
no.
Yakuza gangs type shit.
Oh,

613
00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.500
they're worried about organized crime.

614
00:34:03.501 --> 00:34:05.450
They're worried about the perceptions and their culture.

615
00:34:05.451 --> 00:34:09.870
The tattoos have a very different feeling than they do in this culture and the,

616
00:34:09.871 --> 00:34:12.120
you know,
like in their culture,
it's,

617
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:15.950
if you have like tattoos all over your body like you are,
you know,

618
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.850
it's very possible you're connected to the Yakuza.
That's the initial,

619
00:34:19.851 --> 00:34:22.970
that's originally like the guys who wore the body suits.

620
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:27.000
Those were like the Japanese gangsters.
There's no tattoo calls or Japan,
right?

621
00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.940
Well,
there's definitely tattoo parlors because it's,

622
00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:31.220
and it's not all of them because there's some of them that are,
you know,

623
00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:34.040
obviously there's some of them that are artists and some of them that are just

624
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.340
young people like tattoos.
A lot of Japanese fighters have tattoos.
Kid,

625
00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:40.790
y'all modot has crazy tattoos all over the place.
You know,
it's not,
I mean,

626
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:43.010
there's people that fight that social restriction,

627
00:34:43.011 --> 00:34:45.800
but you're not allowed to go into a public swimming pools.

628
00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.530
If there's a swimming pool at the hotel,
they won't let you get in the water.

629
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.920
If you have tattoos,
you have to leave you.

630
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:53.900
If you want to go in the gym and you have to wear a long sleeve shirt.

631
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:56.030
I was just how they are.
I mean,

632
00:34:56.031 --> 00:34:58.980
I guess in their culture just means something different.
It means,
you know,
it's,

633
00:34:58.981 --> 00:35:00.950
it's like people don't want to feel uncomfortable.

634
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.170
They don't want to go somewhere and have someone,
you know,

635
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:05.450
and I kind of see their point.
You know,
you don't know.

636
00:35:05.451 --> 00:35:08.660
You see someone all tattooed up that's looks kind of creepy.
You know,

637
00:35:08.661 --> 00:35:10.980
you're there with your kids or something.
And what if this person is like a,

638
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:15.170
an aggressive,
angry person,
you know,
that seems like a weird message to send.

639
00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.140
You know,
that's their perception.
I totally understand it.
It's,

640
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:22.320
they're so fucking nice there.
It doesn't even bother you.
I mean,
even she,

641
00:35:22.321 --> 00:35:26.540
you know,
she's like,
thank you for understanding.
Thank you for understanding.
Wow.

642
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:28.320
Yeah.
She was very nice about it.

643
00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:32.570
She wasn't judgemental if that had happened like in someplace,
you know,
some,

644
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:35.060
some fucking weird place,
you know when you like,

645
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.180
you know if you were in like if you had like [inaudible] type place.
Yeah.

646
00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.590
If you had like Satan tattooed on your arm.
Right.

647
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.530
You know you went to Kentucky and tried to use Jim's keys,

648
00:35:43.531 --> 00:35:47.160
me weed out with allows Satan to work out in this gym.

649
00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:51.690
So if you want to come in here cause threatened all these people with your site

650
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:53.820
and Tattoo,
I could see that happening.

651
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.340
It would just kick you out and yell at you.
But this lady was so nice.

652
00:35:56.341 --> 00:36:00.570
I'll study when you have to cover tattoos.
He's I'm okay.

653
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.020
We uh,
we have a short for you or your,
you have a shirt for me,

654
00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.520
we will get that shirt for you.
I go,

655
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:07.920
well I could just go back up to my room and put a shirt on,

656
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:08.931
put a long sleeve shirt on.

657
00:36:08.931 --> 00:36:13.350
I just don't know what size and I started a large extra large,
whatever you got.

658
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:14.640
She comes back with a large,

659
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:18.840
I put it on and to put it on right there for it going,
wow,
I cover up.

660
00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.940
<v 4>That's great.
I'm glad I didn't bust out my waterfall tattoo.
I was like,</v>

661
00:36:21.941 --> 00:36:24.040
what the fuck man,
this is weird.

662
00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:28.580
<v 2>You know,
it was a really weird huh.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

663
00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.670
but that's their culture.
You know,

664
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:34.640
<v 4>again,
you know,
it was also weird,
like I went to a couple of the nightclubs,</v>

665
00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:38.960
we and like there when the Russians walked in,
the Russian women,

666
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.410
Russian women were really popular in Japan.

667
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:46.730
And so these really beautiful like in a runway kind of beautiful way.

668
00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.820
Like they're slightly weird looking,
but you can tell that their models,

669
00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:53.480
but they would walk in and immediately this weird energy,
like light,

670
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:57.710
they were up to something or they just seem to evil.
What's funny,
the Japanese,

671
00:36:57.711 --> 00:37:01.550
the Russians have always had some sort of a connection in Japan with mixed

672
00:37:01.551 --> 00:37:05.060
martial arts because the Japanese,
uh,
always,
you know,

673
00:37:05.061 --> 00:37:09.420
like when they ran pride and they always had like bad ass Russian guys like Igor

674
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:13.310
of,
of Changsha in came down and of course fade or came down fate or his brother,

675
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.761
you know,

676
00:37:13.761 --> 00:37:17.870
there's a bunch of different guys like Badass dudes that came from Russia.

677
00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:22.500
It's really funny that like connection of Russia and in Japan,
you know,
in,

678
00:37:22.501 --> 00:37:26.870
in mixed martial arts.
So when you're out at a club and then the model world,

679
00:37:26.871 --> 00:37:30.610
the connection between Japan and Russia must be pretty intense as well.

680
00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.660
Those girls are everywhere,
right?
It's what they like,
right?
Yeah.
They,

681
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.650
and they seem like,

682
00:37:36.651 --> 00:37:39.440
I asked a lot about them because every time they would walk in there at all,

683
00:37:39.441 --> 00:37:42.860
I would just get the vibe,
the same vibe every time I saw him.
And I guess,

684
00:37:42.861 --> 00:37:43.694
you know,
they,
they get,

685
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.880
they come out feeling like they're going to be the next best thing because they

686
00:37:46.881 --> 00:37:49.070
come out there to actually be lip be logit models.

687
00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:52.820
But then they slowly turn into like hookers and stuff like that.
So,

688
00:37:52.821 --> 00:37:55.820
but allegedly,
allegedly.
But the,
the,
the,

689
00:37:55.821 --> 00:37:59.480
the first batch of them is what you would always see out at the clubs.

690
00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.900
And it was just weird because I don't know why I think that I'm just very

691
00:38:02.901 --> 00:38:06.020
intimidated by Russian women kind of freaked me out.
Like they're,

692
00:38:06.021 --> 00:38:10.050
they're very beautiful and they have this weird look or vibe to them that this

693
00:38:10.051 --> 00:38:13.040
is,
some of them are very nice,
don't,
oh yeah,
totally.

694
00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.690
Obviously there's some of them that are very nice.

695
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:18.320
There's a lot of people in Russia that it lived a hard life,
you know?
And,

696
00:38:18.321 --> 00:38:19.940
and people that lived a hard life,
girls,

697
00:38:19.941 --> 00:38:23.480
I've seen some shit that maybe you haven't seen it maybe like their perceptions

698
00:38:23.481 --> 00:38:26.690
of death and life and crimes and what you got to do to get by.

699
00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.660
Maybe it's different than yours and maybe they happen to be beautiful as well.

700
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:33.500
I think it's the beautiful,
they're beautiful and they grew up in a,
in a place,

701
00:38:33.501 --> 00:38:36.070
you know,
who knows?
I mean,
but if a girl's,
you know,
essentially a sex

702
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.630
<v 2>worker,
most likely,
yeah,</v>

703
00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.780
most likely she did grow up in some really fucked up place.
You know,

704
00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:44.590
I mean a lot of these girls that,
that do become like escorts,
you know,

705
00:38:44.591 --> 00:38:47.590
I mean think about that.
Would you imagine if that could,
you know,

706
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:48.820
imagine if that was your daughter.

707
00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.790
Imagine if that was your child that grew to become some,
uh,

708
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.440
some woman who would fly around the world.
And

709
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:59.760
<v 3>yeah,
it was also weird was that when you're walking down this one street,</v>

710
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.160
I got lost in Japan a lot by the way.

711
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:04.920
Cause like you had to do a lot of work are you wanted to work out and stuff.

712
00:39:04.921 --> 00:39:08.520
I would like take weird walks because it felt so safe to walk there at night.

713
00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.090
And one time I walked like four hours the wrong direction.
And I had,

714
00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:17.240
I was completely like,
but yeah,
you,
you went fucking nutty one night,
man.
I did.

715
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.300
My thought is always when I come to a place like I better be,
uh,

716
00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.850
I would like watching the fights better.

717
00:39:23.851 --> 00:39:26.900
I feel like I'm more focused when I get some fucking sleep,
right.

718
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:30.660
So I forced myself to get some sleep and you were like,
well I'm in Japan.

719
00:39:30.661 --> 00:39:33.700
I got to make this happen.
And it was weird cause the,

720
00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.560
the every three blocks at this one street was just awesome because I think it

721
00:39:37.561 --> 00:39:41.340
was the red light district or something and every three like steps I would take

722
00:39:41.341 --> 00:39:44.610
there would,
somebody grabbed me like he went massage,
massage,
massage.

723
00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.090
And so I finally went,
I went with one of them.
I was like,
you know what?

724
00:39:48.091 --> 00:39:48.661
I'm going to try,

725
00:39:48.661 --> 00:39:53.640
I like massages and what she's saying to me converting my head was like $40 or

726
00:39:53.641 --> 00:39:56.460
something like that.
So I was like,
I'll take you up on it cause your sugar,

727
00:39:56.461 --> 00:39:59.700
you're just,
you know,
really hot Asian woman,
woman.

728
00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.240
And so like we go up to this weird like room,
it was super weird,

729
00:40:03.241 --> 00:40:06.960
but there's this curtain and then she leaves the room and this older Asian woman

730
00:40:06.961 --> 00:40:11.430
comes out and then I was like,
I got a massage from a really scary Asian women.

731
00:40:11.431 --> 00:40:14.490
Then at the end of this,
the first time that's ever happened,
and then she goes,

732
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.130
ah,
you weren't happy ending.
And I'm like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
That's okay.

733
00:40:17.131 --> 00:40:21.030
And like I had to talk myself out of not getting a happy ending because it was

734
00:40:21.031 --> 00:40:24.150
that,
I mean,
you would think like,
yeah,
why not?
No one's gonna know.

735
00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:28.890
But it was that creepy of an Asian admitted that you would be Dell for a happy

736
00:40:28.891 --> 00:40:32.810
ending under the right circumstances.
I think that's what he just did Sunday.

737
00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.580
Got To be more capital works.
And I know I would never say that.

738
00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:38.280
Of course you wouldn't.
Why are you talking about massage on your Dick?

739
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:41.840
Cause it's not appropriate.
Our society does not condone it or allow it.
Brian,

740
00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.940
you can get a massage on your neck.
You can get your nose played with.

741
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.520
That's totally illegal.
You're,
you're right.

742
00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:48.990
I'm just something really gay about that.

743
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.430
<v 2>Imagine if there was like a guy and that's what he would do.</v>

744
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:52.900
He's just rubbing kiss your nose.

745
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.990
<v 3>This does this business.
You know,
some people do neck massage is,</v>

746
00:40:57.991 --> 00:40:59.840
some people are into like reef icology.

747
00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.830
What does that reflexology when they play with your feet?
It's not really,

748
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:05.580
it's not real is it?
Is that real?
I think there's something to it.

749
00:41:05.581 --> 00:41:08.610
When they have like the Meridians of the foot,
is it really?
I think that's real.

750
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.920
Okay.
I don't know.

751
00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:13.560
But I would say cause I mean when they play with certain parts of your face,

752
00:41:13.561 --> 00:41:17.910
you know that that's again,
different pressures of your face.
That's,
you know,

753
00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:20.790
you can feel it.
Especially when it's around the third eye.

754
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.820
You ever feel that when they play with your face?
Yeah.

755
00:41:23.821 --> 00:41:28.140
Where they take hot oil on your third eye right here and then the middle and

756
00:41:28.141 --> 00:41:29.310
they just kind of slowly rub it.

757
00:41:29.311 --> 00:41:33.380
You can feel that the release of some kind of tension in your head.
You know

758
00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:36.200
<v 2>what?
What the fuck do you think does Brian,</v>

759
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:39.860
I don't know what you're talking about besides his nice massage or your deck.

760
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:42.470
Just as nice.
It's really that simple.
You know?

761
00:41:42.471 --> 00:41:44.840
No one wants to look at it that way because you don't want your wife going to

762
00:41:44.841 --> 00:41:46.700
someplace and getting fingered.
It was awesome.

763
00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:50.660
<v 3>Weird seeing the Africans and in Japan because they would be like the people</v>

764
00:41:50.661 --> 00:41:51.040
that would work.

765
00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.770
<v 2>Did you,
did you know,
I want him to say this before I forget because uh,</v>

766
00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:57.650
what we're talking about going to doctors getting fingered,
you know,

767
00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:00.880
that is what women used to do.
Yes.
The women,

768
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.440
the idea of women being hysterical,

769
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:06.520
hysterical is connected to like hysterectomy.

770
00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:10.180
It's connected to your fucking losing your fucking mind because you're not

771
00:42:10.181 --> 00:42:13.300
coming.
A lot of women would go to doctors.

772
00:42:13.301 --> 00:42:17.140
It's a long time ago and the doctor would actually manipulate them to orgasm.

773
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.090
Yes.
It was a common thing.
Common thing.
You don't do it anymore.
Nope.

774
00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:26.710
They don't do it anymore.
But man,
who stopped the these oppressed,
you know,

775
00:42:26.711 --> 00:42:28.490
fucked up sexual woman that the,

776
00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:33.260
the thing to do scientifically was to stimulate them to orgasm.
That's hilarious.

777
00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.010
Yeah.
When did that stop?
I don't know.
I don't know any of the history on it.

778
00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:40.330
I should probably Google it while we're sitting here talking because it's a

779
00:42:40.331 --> 00:42:42.970
really,
I should substantiate it because I'm pretty sure it's true.

780
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.460
Who was the cock blocker on that to some fucking,

781
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:49.000
probably some religious guy that wanted to fuck man,
you know?

782
00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:49.551
<v 3>Yeah.
It was weird.</v>

783
00:42:49.551 --> 00:42:53.270
The Africans in Japan where the guys that were like supposed to be the bad ass

784
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:56.480
kids are going to come up like,
hey man,
come on.
Come in this bar man.
Come on,

785
00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.230
you can do it.
Come on.
You want some weed?
And somebody did offer me weed,

786
00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.590
which I guess is super crazy illegal in Japan.
So I was like,
no,

787
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.620
as much as I wanted to smoke,
I don't feel like going to jail for a year.

788
00:43:06.621 --> 00:43:09.950
I guess it was like the minimum of getting weed in Japan.

789
00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:14.290
<v 2>Is it really that much?
Something like that.
He was saying,
I just had a guy we,</v>

790
00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:16.500
sorry.
Yeah,
there's a whole book on this subject.

791
00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:21.060
The technology of orgasm hysteria,
the vibrator and women's sexual satisfaction.

792
00:43:21.061 --> 00:43:25.590
It's a John Hopkins study in the history of technology.
Yeah.

793
00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:30.540
Pretty crazy man.
So listen to this.
Um,
from,
from the time of Hippocrates,

794
00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:35.520
since the 1920s massaging female patients to orgasm was a staple of medical

795
00:43:35.521 --> 00:43:37.380
practice amongst western physicians.

796
00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:41.790
And the treatment of hysteria and ailment once considered both common and

797
00:43:41.791 --> 00:43:46.791
chronic and women doctors low this time consuming procedure for centuries and

798
00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.393
uh,

799
00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:53.220
what doctors low this time consuming procedure and for centuries relied on

800
00:43:53.221 --> 00:43:58.200
midwives and later they substituted the efficacy of mechanical devices including

801
00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:02.850
the electric vibrator invented in the 1880s.
And the technology of orgasm,

802
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.110
Ralph mains offers or reading reader's at stimulating surprising and often

803
00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:10.140
humorous account of this hysteria and its treatment throughout the ages.

804
00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:10.973
So this has been like,

805
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:15.570
that's like a standard treatment for a long time and they just stopped doing it.

806
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:19.140
What makes sense man?
Just like it makes sense that men need to get jerked off.

807
00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:22.050
Like for women or ideally you would want your husband to do it.

808
00:44:22.051 --> 00:44:23.850
Ideally you'd want your,
you know,
your boyfriend,

809
00:44:23.851 --> 00:44:27.570
your love or whatever you would want that the person that you engage in sex with

810
00:44:27.571 --> 00:44:32.150
to get you off.
But if that's not happening,
you're probably your shit and you,

811
00:44:32.151 --> 00:44:33.060
you know,
you become,
uh,

812
00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:38.250
a less effective functioning Mather method or a member of society rather that

813
00:44:39.091 --> 00:44:43.260
method of relieving the tension than just the physical tension.
If nothing else.

814
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.460
That's all it is,
is there's a physical tension in your body.
You manipulate it.

815
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:49.200
Ah,
it doesn't mean there's no love involved there.
There's nothing.

816
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.480
It's just you have a buildup,
you know?

817
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:55.740
It's like blowing your nose except the doctors finger you.
I just,

818
00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:58.950
yeah,
I think the doctor should,
shouldn't do that.
I would hate that doc.

819
00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:03.550
That dr still to your girl.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's why you're not doing work that like,

820
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:06.950
no,
I don't want,
I know my wife to talk to her,
wiping my daughters,

821
00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:08.850
but either I want to be able to,
you know,

822
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.010
you want to be able to do your job as a parent.
Your girlfriend be like,
ah,

823
00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:15.000
I'm going to the doctor again.
You want to be able to do your job as a man.

824
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.130
You want to be able to do your job as a man.
If you'd gone,

825
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:18.870
if your girls going to the doctor,
get her finger,

826
00:45:18.871 --> 00:45:23.380
bang her a little pussy with a mechanical device because the doctors could have

827
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.580
maybe the doctor's hot.
Maybe he's eating her ass while you listen.

828
00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.800
I'm just going to eat your ass.
We do flood.
I can't believe you're doing this.

829
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.050
Is this in the,
you really supposed to be doing this.

830
00:45:31.051 --> 00:45:35.380
I'm just actually pleasing you.
That's what my job is.
Let me ask.
Okay.

831
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:38.640
Would you be upset if you like,
this is so crazy.

832
00:45:38.641 --> 00:45:42.840
I went to the doctor to get my weekly hysteria release,
you know?

833
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.790
I mean they recommended it.
I have to go,

834
00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:46.860
especially since you can't get it up anymore.

835
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:51.510
And while in the middle of the hysteria release he just starts eating my ass and

836
00:45:51.511 --> 00:45:55.530
I'm like,
okay,
is this part,
I mean is that cheating?
Is that cheating?

837
00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.000
Cheating if he's fingering her?
But if he starts eating her ass,
is that cheating?

838
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:01.680
He's just being a doctor.

839
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.780
He said I come quicker when he eats my ass and he doesn't have time to just keep

840
00:46:06.781 --> 00:46:09.990
fingering me.
If you were really,
if you were going to finger someone,

841
00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:13.320
the best way to do it is to really just go crazy.
What gets her off?

842
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.110
Is it eating your asshole?
So his body,
his finger and he's probably like,

843
00:46:16.111 --> 00:46:19.980
what's Mrsa?
Mrsa.
Rockhold I don't know how to bring this up.
I'll,

844
00:46:19.981 --> 00:46:24.570
so I'll just be blunt.
Is there a better way to for me to be fingering new here?

845
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:26.550
If I eat your ass do you think you will come quicker?

846
00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:29.220
Cause my hand's getting tired and there's a lot of people after you in line.

847
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:32.580
If you ever got print hands from fingering a girl,
I don't think it happens.

848
00:46:32.581 --> 00:46:33.320
I think there's like a,

849
00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:38.320
an alien like slippery slimy stuff that's inside the woman's body and it doesn't

850
00:46:39.331 --> 00:46:42.230
interact with your body like water unless your girls,

851
00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:46.860
unless your girl is pissing on your hands so much that they prune up.
It happens.

852
00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:50.550
That was cause your girl shoots right?
It doesn't.
She have that knowledge.

853
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.950
I just not her blowhole now

854
00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.870
could you imagine if that was normal?

855
00:46:57.871 --> 00:47:01.260
If every man and woman and a blow hole and their back and they just shot fucking

856
00:47:01.261 --> 00:47:02.740
water up in the air everywhere we were,

857
00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.180
you drink water but you could shoot it up there so that you could do both.

858
00:47:06.181 --> 00:47:09.900
You could like swim in the ocean and you could also like live on the ground.

859
00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:13.230
If we had a blowhole,
why would that hurt us?
An actual little hole.

860
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.940
We could be both.
We could be like aqua man.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

861
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:21.680
We could swim around.
No problem.
We have a shit design.
You know,

862
00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:24.480
this is one of the theories is that human beings actually evolved the water.

863
00:47:24.481 --> 00:47:26.160
It's called the aquatic ape theory.

864
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.950
The idea is that we're the only animal that has its babies have so much fat on

865
00:47:29.951 --> 00:47:33.250
them.
And then uh,
some of that might have been so that they were more buoyant.

866
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.170
I can case they fell into the water.

867
00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:39.070
You could catch them quicker and like that's like w we were born with this layer

868
00:47:39.071 --> 00:47:43.390
of fat all over and eventually will become like a smaller version of ourselves.

869
00:47:43.391 --> 00:47:45.580
But chimps like as they're born,
the little babies,

870
00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:49.180
a little muscle bound little babies,
they're not all fat chubby like our babies.

871
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:50.920
Our babies are all fat and Chubby.

872
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:54.380
<v 3>What have like thousands and thousands,
thousands of years ago before caveman,</v>

873
00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:58.050
before everything,
we were just like really,
really fat and just lived in puddles.

874
00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:01.050
And so it'd be just like we'd still talked the,
hey,
what's going on?

875
00:48:01.051 --> 00:48:04.140
But we just like lay in the huddles and we couldn't move cause we couldn't

876
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:04.960
<v 2>walk yet.</v>

877
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:08.170
Well maybe we found some food that was so awesome that goes in the puddles.

878
00:48:08.171 --> 00:48:09.930
That was all we needed to do.
You know,

879
00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.550
it just tasted like chocolate cake and it was the best thing for your body.

880
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:15.610
And so it's like the best way to get at it.
Just eat it all day and just,

881
00:48:15.611 --> 00:48:19.600
we just laid in puddles and eight fungus.
There's chocolate cake,

882
00:48:19.601 --> 00:48:23.800
fungus to tasted awesome.
What a creepy visual.
Yeah.

883
00:48:23.801 --> 00:48:25.660
What could we visual Floyd visual,
you know,

884
00:48:25.661 --> 00:48:26.950
it really creeped me out the other day,
man,

885
00:48:26.951 --> 00:48:29.800
I was watching something on volcanoes and uh,
you know,

886
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:32.380
they were showing all the different towns.

887
00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:36.720
Apparently they have discovered a whole volcanic um,
uh,

888
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.080
like a,
an entire forest.
I believe it's in China under a,

889
00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:42.010
under a volcano,

890
00:48:42.011 --> 00:48:45.160
like hundreds of millions of years old and they're going to like dig down into

891
00:48:45.161 --> 00:48:46.690
this and this and like a whole,

892
00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.780
like forest had been covered by volcanic ash and shit.

893
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:53.400
They look at their sort of just discovering it and I'm piecing it now and you

894
00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:57.490
realize when you see shit like that that at any point in time these Jeez giant

895
00:48:57.491 --> 00:49:01.360
natural disasters that have happened so many times over the history of the

896
00:49:01.361 --> 00:49:05.110
planet.
Like we haven't got that wired yet.
We don't know when they're coming.

897
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:09.370
We don't know what,
what to do when they hit or if we can do anything.

898
00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.480
Like the big ones,

899
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:13.360
like the super volcanoes and the shifting of the polar ice caps,

900
00:49:13.361 --> 00:49:17.140
like all that stuff's coming.
Like that's how the planet works.

901
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.380
Like it almost seems like it's designed that way.

902
00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:21.950
Like there's a little reset button,

903
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.210
it goes on to Yale and play the game for so long and then pat time's up.

904
00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:27.040
Next civilization,
you know,

905
00:49:27.041 --> 00:49:29.560
you've got to bring in the next people that play the game.
You know?

906
00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.530
I mean it almost really say,
could you imagine?
I mean,

907
00:49:32.531 --> 00:49:33.880
if that's what civilization is,

908
00:49:33.881 --> 00:49:36.550
I mean we really realistically humans in this form.

909
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:38.290
How long have you been around?
How long a monkey's been around it?

910
00:49:38.291 --> 00:49:39.280
How many millions of years?

911
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:43.390
Let's just get crazy and just say 65 million years ago when the dinosaurs got

912
00:49:43.391 --> 00:49:44.440
hit by that big meteor,

913
00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:47.200
let's say there was no monkeys back then because I'm pretty sure there weren't

914
00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:52.000
so just in 65 million years,
which is nothing.
All this shit has happened.

915
00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:55.360
You know,
all this shit has happened.
Who knows?
This couldn't have happened.

916
00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:57.130
What if this happened already?

917
00:49:57.490 --> 00:50:00.910
What if the whole thing had been started from the beginning to the end?

918
00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:03.760
People had to figure things out.
There was,
you know,

919
00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:07.870
an advanced civilization and it got hit by a fucking media and then it had to

920
00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:10.150
start all over again from scratch,

921
00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:15.550
from scratch with Amoebas and things that survived with the bottom of the sea to

922
00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:16.830
eventually,
intelligently.

923
00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.410
How many times could that happen in the course of a son?
You know,

924
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:25.150
all that shit's possible week.
This could end for us at any moment,
any moment,

925
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.450
boom,
the sky turns and that's the end.
Cause a hyper Nova,

926
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:32.780
a couple million light years away blew up on us.

927
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:37.460
<v 3>God Damn,
I'm scared.
I was.
I was kinda scared of flying back.</v>

928
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:42.490
I started if I kept on falling asleep and then waking up thinking about could we

929
00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:46.130
are flying over the ocean and was the first time I ever flew or the ocean and

930
00:50:46.131 --> 00:50:49.400
that really,
if you think about it while you're flying over the ocean,

931
00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:53.140
it's really creepy to think about like when you were sober too.
Yeah.

932
00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.980
You were actually a little drunk stove.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was definitely not.

933
00:50:56.981 --> 00:51:00.260
And you're not really.
Yeah,
I know when you're hammered,
but,

934
00:51:00.261 --> 00:51:03.800
but it was like I was thinking like if there was an emergency landing,

935
00:51:03.801 --> 00:51:04.820
you needed to get these

936
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.370
and then I was thinking about like how you going to give you get you by the way.

937
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:11.390
Yeah.
That's the thing.

938
00:51:11.391 --> 00:51:13.130
If something goes down in the middle of the middle of the ocean,

939
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.950
they don't send in a plane to land and we'll get it.
Okay.

940
00:51:15.951 --> 00:51:20.810
They have to bring in boats.
Fishermen get the sharks.
That body out of some boat.

941
00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:21.240
Yeah,

942
00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:25.730
<v 2>somewhere near you where it happened.
They send that out.
Fuck that.</v>

943
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.560
Fuck that and dude,
but we're going to do it again.

944
00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.160
<v 3>Stay home.
I don't know.
Japan.</v>

945
00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:32.780
Don't think of it when you're flying in the ocean that I kept on thinking about

946
00:51:32.781 --> 00:51:34.260
it.
I couldn't stop thinking about it was freaking me out.

947
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:40.100
<v 2>Yeah.
Our forms of transportation are quite frightening when you think about what</v>

948
00:51:40.101 --> 00:51:41.180
happens when they go wrong.

949
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.420
But what's really fascinating is what does the future hold?
You know,

950
00:51:44.421 --> 00:51:47.690
200 years ago when people were first putting together railroads,

951
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:52.340
they would've never,
ever believed that we could get to the point we are today.

952
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:55.280
The 200 years ago,
before there was no cars 200 years ago,
right?

953
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:59.510
In 1811 there was no cars.
So imagine that.

954
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:04.580
Imagine that amount of time and imagine what has taken place and now think about

955
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.040
what that amount of time in the future is gonna hold.

956
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:10.580
We're gonna admit it's going to be like people miss.
If you don't get there,

957
00:52:10.581 --> 00:52:14.840
you just splatter into fucking billion particles and blow off in the wind.

958
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:15.740
That's what's going to happen.

959
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:19.400
We're going to make like some sort of a star track replica thing where you beam

960
00:52:19.401 --> 00:52:22.200
yourself places and Shit's going to go wrong sometimes.

961
00:52:22.201 --> 00:52:23.390
So there's going to be like terrorist.

962
00:52:23.391 --> 00:52:26.870
It's that set up mirrors so that as you tried to beat herself up at fucking

963
00:52:26.871 --> 00:52:30.920
scatters your app,
your essence all throughout the universe.
You know,
who knows,

964
00:52:30.921 --> 00:52:35.921
who knows what kind of crazy time travel teleportation shit that's going to,

965
00:52:36.111 --> 00:52:38.810
they're going to be able to figure out.
As far as like travel,

966
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:39.920
I think it's going to 200 years.

967
00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:43.110
<v 3>I think it's going to have something to do with traveling back from Japan to La</v>

968
00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:46.470
back and forth so many times until you start going back in time.

969
00:52:46.471 --> 00:52:47.400
More and more and more.

970
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:55.590
How weird is that though?
Like we relive this same morning twice.
Pretty

971
00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:59.430
<v 2>crazy,
but do you think that at a certain point in time when you know,
if they've,</v>

972
00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:03.330
I know they've done things with particles where they've managed to teleport

973
00:53:03.331 --> 00:53:07.230
particles,
but I don't quite understand that shit.
I don't understand if they're,

974
00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:09.240
I don't know what's really going on there,

975
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:13.680
but you got to assume that if they could figure out a way to transport anything,

976
00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:15.270
anything,
even an email,

977
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:18.960
even the idea that something's going through a fucking going through a wifi

978
00:53:18.961 --> 00:53:20.370
network in space,

979
00:53:20.371 --> 00:53:23.850
it's in the air and it lands in your fucking laptop and you're just sitting

980
00:53:23.851 --> 00:53:28.851
there wirelessly connected to the universe and then something comes in a big

981
00:53:29.221 --> 00:53:33.240
file,
a big piece of information.
And now the fact that you can do that,

982
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:37.350
you start thinking about what if you could figure out a way to break a person

983
00:53:37.351 --> 00:53:39.540
down to ones and Zeros.
You know what?

984
00:53:39.541 --> 00:53:41.490
If you could break a person down to a program,

985
00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:44.220
if you commit to being a program in our intranet,

986
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:47.880
we offer you a lifelong creative adventure.

987
00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:50.940
You can decide what you want to do with your life.

988
00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:55.140
You'll be living online and your consciousness will be in the hand of trusted

989
00:53:55.141 --> 00:54:00.141
engineers that were responsible for such amazing movies as Lord of the rings and

990
00:54:01.201 --> 00:54:05.610
King Kong.
And you could just have you get to sign up for this shit.

991
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:07.380
And as long as your credit holds out,

992
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:12.660
they just connect you and your essence to a computer and they throw you into a

993
00:54:12.661 --> 00:54:16.410
computer simulation and you're just a plug in the wall.

994
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:19.770
You already like the Matrix.
Is it possible?
We already are.

995
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.820
What is that guy's name?

996
00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:26.660
The Guy who decided he was going to give up Joe Biden?
No,
no,

997
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:30.180
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
In the Matrix.
He was a very famous,

998
00:54:30.181 --> 00:54:34.110
like he was always in those gangster movies.
Joey pants,
Joe Pantalone,

999
00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:38.460
you know,
you know what I'm talking about.
Yeah.
Very good actor.
Anyway,
he was,

1000
00:54:38.461 --> 00:54:42.390
he's the one who was in the Matrix and he decided that he was going to give up

1001
00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.270
and he was going to join the other side.
He was like one of the good guys,

1002
00:54:45.271 --> 00:54:47.730
one of the parts of the resistance,
but he couldn't,
he couldn't hack it anymore.

1003
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:48.780
Right.
He's getting tired of it.

1004
00:54:48.781 --> 00:54:50.960
So he's going to give up Morpheus and he was getting,

1005
00:54:50.961 --> 00:54:53.730
and they were like in a restaurant with him and he's eating steak and he was

1006
00:54:53.731 --> 00:54:56.250
like telling him that he wants to be like a good looking guy.

1007
00:54:56.251 --> 00:54:58.170
Like an important person.
Maybe a movie star.

1008
00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.020
<v 3>Oh right,
right,
right.
You remember that?
Yeah.</v>

1009
00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.750
<v 2>That was pretty wild.
Yeah.</v>

1010
00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:04.450
Cause you know there'd be people like that if that really,

1011
00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.810
if that became really presented itself,
like here's what you can do.

1012
00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:11.590
You can either continue what you're doing or be the baddest motherfucker in the

1013
00:55:11.591 --> 00:55:14.990
world in the Matrix and you won't be able to discern whether it's really not.

1014
00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.900
A lot of people would take that.
Yeah.

1015
00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:21.250
What a what a weird choice and a real possibility.

1016
00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:24.700
You know when you stop and think about what an incredible movie that was,

1017
00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:28.530
that that movie presented,
this idea,
you know,
and the,
the,

1018
00:55:28.531 --> 00:55:30.490
the fact that as technology moves forward,

1019
00:55:30.491 --> 00:55:33.130
that might one day become a possibility.

1020
00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:38.310
Some sort of a computer neuro interface that projects a created reality into

1021
00:55:39.281 --> 00:55:43.600
your own head and hijacks all your senses and has all your senses feeling and

1022
00:55:43.601 --> 00:55:46.770
smelling and it has your Dick at and hard and you really think you're fucking,

1023
00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:49.120
you think everything's going on.
You're the king of the God damn world.

1024
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:53.320
You're Conan the barbarian,
you're slaying dragons.
You never even die.

1025
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:54.970
Every time you want to win,

1026
00:55:54.971 --> 00:55:58.990
you win and you just fucking bitches everywhere over the bodies of your enemies.

1027
00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:01.420
<v 3>It probably is going to be something like that.</v>

1028
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:03.980
We're going to wake up from the program.
I didn't go,
Oh yeah,

1029
00:56:03.981 --> 00:56:07.280
we started this program a long time ago,
you know,

1030
00:56:07.281 --> 00:56:09.470
that were somewhere else and we're like,
oh,
we forgot it.
Oh,

1031
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:12.770
we're just in a buggy version.
Yeah,
you don't like it.

1032
00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:15.080
Like when you wake up from like getting anesthesia or something like that and

1033
00:56:15.081 --> 00:56:19.760
you're like,
wait,
what the fuck?
Oh yeah.
I had the operation I,
I was knocked out.

1034
00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:22.910
But what if we wake up from life like that where we were like,
Oh,

1035
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.460
I started this program

1036
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:28.070
<v 1>is life program hack on my phone.
Somebody just knocked on the door.
Yeah,</v>

1037
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:32.500
that was car accident.
Oh.
Um,
this is what I was going to talk about,

1038
00:56:32.501 --> 00:56:34.180
the very beginning of the podcast.
What I went,
oh,

1039
00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.800
let's get some time in before to talk about this.
There's a,

1040
00:56:38.801 --> 00:56:43.120
a a fighter apparently that's on this season of the ultimate fighter that uh,

1041
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:48.290
allegedly they're saying was in a gay porn.
Why?
Yeah.

1042
00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:52.370
I allowed to talk about this.
I don't know.
I don't know if it's real.
Um,

1043
00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:55.930
hold on fighter on all to,

1044
00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.170
I wouldn't even say his name because I don't know if it is real.

1045
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:03.820
That's pretty cool.
Yeah.
But what I will say is,

1046
00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:05.353
<v 6>MMM,</v>

1047
00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:09.380
<v 1>I'll say two things.
One,
the WHO gives a shit?
Jesus Christ is always that way.</v>

1048
00:57:09.381 --> 00:57:10.550
But anyway,
right.
You know,

1049
00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.900
I mean the dude's gay and he just sticks to what it is,
is,

1050
00:57:13.901 --> 00:57:15.750
is training and fighting.
There is something different.

1051
00:57:15.751 --> 00:57:18.830
We were rolling around with some guy.
That's only if he's fuck no,

1052
00:57:18.831 --> 00:57:21.560
because I've rode with women and it's never been sexual in any way,

1053
00:57:21.561 --> 00:57:25.190
shape or form.
Not Porn Stars.
We rolled with porn stars.
No.
But I rolled with,

1054
00:57:25.191 --> 00:57:27.740
I've rolled with pretty girls before.
It's been a few times.

1055
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:30.800
And you know what man?
First of all,
you gotta be careful cause if they're good,

1056
00:57:30.801 --> 00:57:32.740
like you rolled it out like corn,
it's pretty shitty.

1057
00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:35.720
Or someone like that or Ronda Rousey,
like I'll fucking strangle you.

1058
00:57:35.721 --> 00:57:39.200
Like a dude will too.
But you got to watch your ps and qs.
But it's never,

1059
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:43.130
you know,
it's never that.
It's always,
it's always rolling.
You know,

1060
00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.860
anybody who's rolling is rolling.
Nobody's rolling,
grinding their Dick on,

1061
00:57:45.861 --> 00:57:48.590
you know,
if they are,
they getting choked out.
It just doesn't last.

1062
00:57:49.310 --> 00:57:53.750
You just don't want to think that.
Yeah,
you don't,
don't you don't.

1063
00:57:53.751 --> 00:57:56.810
But I know I've rolled with gay guys.
Absolutely.
100% for sure.

1064
00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:00.530
There's more than one of rolled with more than one gay guy guys who were openly

1065
00:58:00.531 --> 00:58:04.930
gay.
I've rolled with guys who I,
I'm pretty sure were gay.
You know,
it's not,

1066
00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:07.140
it's just who gives a fuck if you're wrong,

1067
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:10.730
was the person is not as long as the person is not inappropriate with you or

1068
00:58:10.731 --> 00:58:14.660
they don't.
They don't do Sean you.
But same way with men and women together,
man.

1069
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:17.810
Can you imagine if men and women shared one fucking locker room everywhere in

1070
00:58:17.811 --> 00:58:20.270
life,
you know,
and women just have deals,
guys,

1071
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:24.200
Douche anonym have you ever rode with somebody and their boners really hard and

1072
00:58:24.201 --> 00:58:25.280
he fell it,
the hall

1073
00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.140
just push back on it just to set up a submission,
you know?

1074
00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:32.720
Well you've got to distract him with your bud hall.
Just Rub.

1075
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:33.890
You could feel the tip of the cock.

1076
00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:36.460
You have to develop a feeling for the tip of the cock.

1077
00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:39.470
You got to know how far you can push it before he's actually raping you

1078
00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:43.240
feel it on your back.
No.
And you're like,
ah,

1079
00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:47.060
that's definitely you gotta think man,
if you're a gay guy and you were,
you know,

1080
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:50.360
really into like fighting for your pussy.

1081
00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.340
If you wanted to fight for your boy pussy,

1082
00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:55.610
you know you want to go do battle and then fucker guy take them down,

1083
00:58:55.640 --> 00:59:00.440
mount them tickets back and then just get in that extra hook.
Some dudes,

1084
00:59:00.441 --> 00:59:02.570
that's what they're looking for as long.
Listen,

1085
00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.520
as long as any guy doesn't do that,

1086
00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:07.580
as long as you don't go rape and other guys you're training with,
you know,

1087
00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:11.240
but was getting is the thing that why I wonder,
you know,

1088
00:59:11.241 --> 00:59:13.200
I don't know if the guy actually did this as we,

1089
00:59:13.201 --> 00:59:14.450
which is why I'm not saying anything,

1090
00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:18.490
but I would wonder if he was honest about it.
If I get anybody who asked,

1091
00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:22.070
I would do.
I would assume that that's like a part of a contract,
right?
Yeah.

1092
00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:24.710
<v 2>Like there's certain stuff that we don't want you to have done.</v>

1093
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:28.040
<v 3>You never need to say it.
At least.
At least you think.
Yeah,</v>

1094
00:59:28.041 --> 00:59:32.360
I do because I would not want to roll with somebody that used to do gay porn.

1095
00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:33.320
That's my personal choice.

1096
00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.180
<v 2>Okay.
If you wrote with a guy who,
because it had,
because when you're rolling,</v>

1097
00:59:37.181 --> 00:59:39.130
who was gay who had gay sex.
Is that okay?

1098
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:43.770
<v 3>I don't know.
No,
I don't think so.
Really.
I just,
cause I think when you're,</v>

1099
00:59:43.771 --> 00:59:44.970
that's the last,
I don't,

1100
00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:48.440
I don't think it's the last frontier that's the last frontier.
You're assholes.

1101
00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:51.420
The last of the Mohicans,
right?
I think it's the same way.
It's like when you,

1102
00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:53.760
when you get pulled over from a girl cop,
you get a,

1103
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.660
or a guy cop and your girl and you need to be pat down.

1104
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:58.740
You think they have to get a girl cop.
Same reason.

1105
00:59:58.741 --> 01:00:02.870
I don't want fucking to be wrong.
Your Dick Armey if you like.
It's

1106
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:05.240
<v 2>different because in that situation you have to be subservient.</v>

1107
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:08.910
And that situation where a cop is there that like you have to stand still while

1108
01:00:08.911 --> 01:00:10.640
the cop essentially molest shoe.

1109
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:13.760
But that's why people have a hard time with that.
I don't know though,

1110
01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:17.270
but it's really interesting because,
um,
you know,
I mean,

1111
01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:19.160
do demand have that same option.

1112
01:00:19.161 --> 01:00:22.730
Like if a woman like no men don't have like a a woman,
can't pat a man down.

1113
01:00:22.731 --> 01:00:26.540
Is that true?
I don't think they can write a man has to pat a man down.
Correct.

1114
01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:31.610
So what you can't like be humiliated by a woman either,
right?
I think,
I think,

1115
01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:35.990
think yeah,
unless you as men,
I don't think men can pat women down,

1116
01:00:35.991 --> 01:00:39.410
but I do know that there was one crazy video online where a woman got arrested

1117
01:00:39.411 --> 01:00:41.540
for something,
turned out to be totally innocent by the way.

1118
01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:45.710
And these cops were giving her a strip search and she's fucking screaming,

1119
01:00:45.711 --> 01:00:47.450
they're holding it and she really did nothing.

1120
01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.490
And it's the craziest video to watch.

1121
01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:52.010
The cops just fucked up and went way too far with it.

1122
01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:56.090
But they held this girl down and like strip searched her and it turned out she

1123
01:00:56.091 --> 01:01:00.320
did nothing,
man.
It was just all fucked up.
It was just,
just,

1124
01:01:00.321 --> 01:01:02.030
they just told her to do it.
She wouldn't.

1125
01:01:02.031 --> 01:01:04.920
And then it got out of hand and then you know,
when people think that they're,

1126
01:01:04.921 --> 01:01:08.840
they're being disrespected or their,
their authorities not being,
you know,

1127
01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:13.310
re accurately represented,
you know,
they'll,

1128
01:01:13.311 --> 01:01:16.250
they'll step in and take things to a horrible place.

1129
01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.330
And that's what I think probably happen.
But it's a,

1130
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:20.290
it's a terrible thing to watch because he watched the tape.

1131
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.150
That could be my sister,
you know,
that could be my,
my mom,

1132
01:01:23.151 --> 01:01:25.310
that could be my wife that could,
you know,
and these,

1133
01:01:25.311 --> 01:01:27.860
these guys are holding her down for her that she's not a fucking terrorist.

1134
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:30.770
Like what are you doing man?
Why are you holding her down and strip search her?

1135
01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:31.910
Look,
this is what you do.

1136
01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:35.120
Just push her in a room and ask her some questions for a few minutes before you

1137
01:01:35.121 --> 01:01:38.390
fucking check inside her asshole for bombs,
you know,
how about you do that?

1138
01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:42.290
And then you would find out,
oh this is a big mistake.
Someone's fucked up.
Okay.

1139
01:01:42.291 --> 01:01:45.380
You're not a danger to society,
man.
It was just someone that can drive you home.

1140
01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.980
Sorry,
we didn't have to look inside your butthole at all.

1141
01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:52.910
So there was just a big mistake.
I mean,
that's what they do.
Do they do,

1142
01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:57.380
did they check your naked body for a woman that's so humiliating to be in a room

1143
01:01:57.381 --> 01:02:00.260
with men,
they're holding you down there checking your naked body.
I mean,

1144
01:02:00.261 --> 01:02:03.620
essentially that's like a rape,
a power move.
I mean,
it really is.
You know,

1145
01:02:03.621 --> 01:02:06.200
that's not a dangerous woman.
She's not shooting anybody.

1146
01:02:06.201 --> 01:02:09.550
She's not trying to blow up the fucking world.
She's just some lady and mood,

1147
01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:11.510
whether she's drunk or crazy or what.

1148
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:14.330
You don't have to be stripping her down like that.
That's nuts.

1149
01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:17.990
But you give people the option,
give,
give people the ability to do that.

1150
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:22.530
People get out of hand.
That's why tasers are fucked up.
Tasers are great.

1151
01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:25.590
If every cop was awesome,
but every cop's not awesome.

1152
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:28.560
So the idea that you just randomly giving tasers,

1153
01:02:28.561 --> 01:02:31.830
so all these dudes and some of them,
I've seen some of the moves where people,

1154
01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:35.400
Taser people,
I've seen some of the shit that happens and it's fucking wrong man.

1155
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:39.210
And it's a salt and it's a crime and they should take the fucking tasers away

1156
01:02:39.211 --> 01:02:41.190
from those guys and they should lose their jobs.
Yeah,

1157
01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:43.050
but what if it's like Taser versus gun,

1158
01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:46.190
where in most instances people probably got shot by a gun?
Was it a,

1159
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.620
if a is in any sort of a situation where a guy is threatening to him,

1160
01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:52.800
then the guy should get tased?
Absolutely.

1161
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:56.790
If they're in any situation where it looks like the guy is trying to physically

1162
01:02:56.791 --> 01:02:59.520
harm them and they can taste that guy,
fuck yeah,

1163
01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.170
that's not what I'm talking about,
man.

1164
01:03:01.171 --> 01:03:04.650
I'm talking about people that have bad days.
It just Taser people.

1165
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:08.430
But you don't use a lot of that Carly taken off.
No,
no.

1166
01:03:08.431 --> 01:03:10.800
It's a good weapon for honest cops.

1167
01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:13.530
But the problem is there's too many people that use it just cause they get

1168
01:03:13.531 --> 01:03:16.110
pissed off or they want immediate respect.

1169
01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:19.620
You know this guys that get out of control with any kind of fucking any piece of

1170
01:03:19.621 --> 01:03:24.600
power,
anything,
whether they're your landlord or your boss or a cop or anything,

1171
01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:29.160
there's certain dudes that just cannot handle where they get to be the guy in

1172
01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:30.480
control.
They can't handle it.

1173
01:03:30.481 --> 01:03:33.090
They go on ego trips are not satisfied enough with their own life.

1174
01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.400
Well most of them can.
You know,

1175
01:03:35.401 --> 01:03:39.020
you just got to figure out a way to weed out the shithead cops and then tasered

1176
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.810
would be awesome while I'm looking at photos of that guy that you're talking

1177
01:03:42.811 --> 01:03:47.740
about,
the gay guy cause he got him fucking guys.
Whoa.

1178
01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:54.690
Let it all be a big Photoshop.
Could be a big Photoshop scandal for sure.

1179
01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.000
Now that's crazy.
I say who cares man,

1180
01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:00.090
it gives you extra motivation and not let that guy beat your ass.

1181
01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:04.440
That's what I say.
I say good for him man.
But you know,

1182
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:06.210
don't ever talk shit on and wonder,

1183
01:04:06.211 --> 01:04:09.450
you know what's going to happen as far as like sponsors and shit liquid.

1184
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:10.303
If that guy's a,

1185
01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:13.890
that would be interesting to see if like a sponsors got homophobic and didn't

1186
01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:16.680
want a sponsor when he was having fights,
you know,

1187
01:04:16.681 --> 01:04:19.050
that would be kind of interesting.
You know,

1188
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.450
they've never had that in the female side either.
Heather,

1189
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:23.160
they ever had a female porn star.

1190
01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:26.280
It turned out that she was like a lesbian porn star and she was fucking bitches

1191
01:04:26.281 --> 01:04:30.900
up.
Have you ever had that?
I don't think so.
What's that one d girl with a penis?

1192
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:34.980
Uh,
China.
China.
Did she do that?
She didn't do MMA now,

1193
01:04:34.981 --> 01:04:39.000
but she did WWF.
It didn't share,
but then she did porn afterwards.
Oh,

1194
01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:42.500
I thought it was,
I never mind.
You're right.
Yeah,
she's doing support.

1195
01:04:42.501 --> 01:04:46.110
And so if you feel like beaten off to that,
go right ahead.
You can go crazy.

1196
01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:50.310
You can go get that.
I think it was,
um,
like a,
like,
like a high end movie too,

1197
01:04:50.311 --> 01:04:53.340
right?
Like I'll live it or something like that,
right?
Probably.
Yeah.

1198
01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:58.650
Some along those lines.
I think deep inside China or some shit,
you know,

1199
01:04:58.651 --> 01:05:03.390
it's always some silly name Tepe in China.
Yeah.

1200
01:05:03.391 --> 01:05:06.270
But she never,
she never had an MMA fights.
I don't know.

1201
01:05:06.271 --> 01:05:09.980
I don't think she was a lesbian either.
Panda X,
x xpress.
Yeah,

1202
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:12.930
she became a porn star after her success as a wrestler.

1203
01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:16.170
It's fucking hard businessman getting thrown around like that.

1204
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.470
There's probably very few jobs out there.
The tax your body like a pro wrestler.

1205
01:05:20.830 --> 01:05:22.630
He wants those dudes fucking slamming chairs.

1206
01:05:22.631 --> 01:05:26.320
You knew each other and shit like holy fuck,
that does not look fun.

1207
01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:30.790
That looks like that's fucking nutty man.
Yeah brother.

1208
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:36.840
All those dudes have like fake hips now and fucking disk repaired discs and you

1209
01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:40.660
know like,
like whole Hogan,
that poor guy.
He's had a whole bunch of surgeries.

1210
01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.390
He's just,
just the size of him.

1211
01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.470
You would think it would be difficult to live life like the weight and just

1212
01:05:47.471 --> 01:05:49.390
walking around with all that.
He's enormous.

1213
01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:53.920
Like people don't realize how big Hulk Hogan is.
That's a fucking giant man.

1214
01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:57.280
I met him the first time I ever met him.
Dude,
he had cowboy boots on.

1215
01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.350
He was out in front of the cigar.

1216
01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:03.640
There's like a Havana room in Beverly hills and I guess he was into cigars and I

1217
01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:06.190
pass by him on the street and dude,

1218
01:06:06.191 --> 01:06:09.460
he's a fucking mountain of a man.

1219
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:12.220
Just carrying all that weight around.
It's got to be brutal.

1220
01:06:12.221 --> 01:06:15.700
And your in your back and your,
your knees,
not,
nevermind,

1221
01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:20.550
let people throw in you through the fucking air.
No,
thank you.

1222
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:23.920
Huge in Japan by the way.
Pro Wrestling's enormous.
Yeah.

1223
01:06:23.921 --> 01:06:26.950
Ariel Helwani was going to hang out with us one night but before he went out he

1224
01:06:26.951 --> 01:06:30.640
wanted to go and check out some uh,
some uh,
pro wrestling thing.

1225
01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:33.310
And by the time he came out I was already asleep,

1226
01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:38.530
but it was the local pro wrestling.
They're like really into this leg,

1227
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:41.110
like crazy,
wild pro wrestling style.

1228
01:06:41.111 --> 01:06:45.670
And they have American MMA fighters come over and do matches like they had Tim

1229
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:47.260
Sylvia had a match with Jerome Le Banner.

1230
01:06:47.261 --> 01:06:51.730
They have a pro wrestling match and it's almost like they're really fighting

1231
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:56.380
choreographed fights but they have to eat shots like drum the banner like kicked

1232
01:06:56.381 --> 01:06:59.200
him Sylvia and the stomach.
Like it's like real shit,
man.

1233
01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:02.620
They're really hitting each other to,
not full blast but enough.
So you're like,

1234
01:07:02.621 --> 01:07:05.560
Holy Shit,
this is like,
this is hard stuff.

1235
01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:08.710
And they use like real submission holds,
you know,
it's pretty wild.

1236
01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:12.880
Like a lot of the guys that do like pro wrestling also fight.
It's kind of crazy.

1237
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:14.820
Like that's where I guess soccer,

1238
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:17.650
who's one of the most famous Japanese mixed martial artists ever.

1239
01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:22.100
He actually has a roots.
His roots are in pro wrestling,
you know,
just,

1240
01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:25.750
but he could really fight,
you know,
so he would do all that,
you know,

1241
01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.740
choreograph shit.
But he could do it to you if you want it to as well.
You know,

1242
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:33.550
you think rampage is done?
No think I have a knee injury.
Apparently.

1243
01:07:33.610 --> 01:07:36.250
Apparently his doctor had told him not to fight.
Look,
you know,

1244
01:07:36.251 --> 01:07:40.960
people want to poo poo this and you,
you don't know,
you know,
people would say,
oh,

1245
01:07:40.961 --> 01:07:41.920
you just push it out.

1246
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:44.020
He puts you down and look like you just want to get a paycheck.

1247
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:48.580
I heard a lot of different things like that and I disagree entirely.
I think he,

1248
01:07:48.581 --> 01:07:52.900
uh,
he was in a situation where he wanted to put on a great show.

1249
01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.630
I know that it was like super important for him to fight in Japan.

1250
01:07:55.930 --> 01:08:00.430
So if he fought,
regardless of the fact that he hurt his knee like that,
you know,

1251
01:08:00.431 --> 01:08:01.630
and you look at how he made it,

1252
01:08:01.631 --> 01:08:04.930
all the pieces point to that he was 211 pounds at weigh in.

1253
01:08:05.110 --> 01:08:08.500
So that means something was wrong that he couldn't train something was wrong and

1254
01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:11.290
that's why he couldn't cut the weight because you need to do it when you're

1255
01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:12.700
cutting a lot of weight,
like rampage,

1256
01:08:12.701 --> 01:08:15.650
she's going down from like two 30 sometimes.
And when you're doing that,

1257
01:08:15.651 --> 01:08:18.740
you got to do that over a period of time where you're really smart about your

1258
01:08:18.741 --> 01:08:22.040
calorie intake and you're really smart about the amount of cardio you do and
you,

1259
01:08:22.041 --> 01:08:24.620
you know,
you got to,
there's a lot of getting in shape.
There's,

1260
01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.520
that's a big part of that.
You know,
sometimes guys,
when they come in heavy,

1261
01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:32.480
the camp becomes more about losing the weight than it does about improving

1262
01:08:32.481 --> 01:08:35.160
skills.
And that's why I like guys like Anthony Johnson,
they,

1263
01:08:35.190 --> 01:08:38.930
they'll do better actually.
And they look better when they go up a weight class,

1264
01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.351
you know,
uh,

1265
01:08:39.351 --> 01:08:42.560
my opinion because then all of a sudden they're not cutting nearly as much and

1266
01:08:42.561 --> 01:08:47.060
now they get to focus their entire training camp on actual skills.
But that said,

1267
01:08:47.061 --> 01:08:51.750
you know,
it's,
it's um,
you know,
it's saying it's,
it's an open debate.
You know,

1268
01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.790
there's different people know how to do it better than other people do it.
So,

1269
01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:55.881
you know,
the,
the I,

1270
01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:59.870
the idea of one person having it figured out universally for every person who

1271
01:08:59.871 --> 01:09:02.390
competes,
that's never gonna happen,
you know?

1272
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.840
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1273
01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.610
<v 4>It's wild.
Watching fights in Japan though,
isn't it?</v>

1274
01:09:05.670 --> 01:09:09.030
I loved it when you to go back there,
I really like,

1275
01:09:09.031 --> 01:09:12.570
I'm thinking about like going back,
just,
just,
uh,
well there's so much right

1276
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:15.240
<v 2>where we were at,
like with the fights took place at the site,</v>

1277
01:09:15.241 --> 01:09:17.610
Thomas Subaru arena.
There's so much history there,
man.

1278
01:09:17.611 --> 01:09:22.050
That place was like the place for all these fucking huge pride events,
man.

1279
01:09:22.410 --> 01:09:25.950
Just like the biggest,
most historic ones ever.

1280
01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:27.840
Like most of them went down there.

1281
01:09:28.050 --> 01:09:31.610
There were some amazing fight it took place there.
Like if you're like,
uh,
uh,

1282
01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:36.120
martial arts historian,
like I'm,
I'm not,
I'm a geek,
you know,
martial arts geek.

1283
01:09:36.121 --> 01:09:39.960
But you know,
like going back and looking at old prides and shit,

1284
01:09:39.961 --> 01:09:43.710
when Nogueira was on top,
I still watch those.
To this day I still would like,

1285
01:09:43.711 --> 01:09:44.940
to me that's like,
you know,

1286
01:09:44.941 --> 01:09:48.000
that they're like movies that like our welcome old movies to watch.

1287
01:09:48.001 --> 01:09:49.860
Like it's a work of art.
Then I'm looking at,
you know,

1288
01:09:49.861 --> 01:09:53.040
and I watch like some of the old pride fights,
they were fucking awesome.

1289
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:54.570
That was so fun.

1290
01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:55.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1291
01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:58.770
<v 2>You know,
sort of be there and that place where all those fights went down.</v>

1292
01:09:58.771 --> 01:10:02.760
I was like,
Holy Shit,
this is a part of like,
to me like one of the,

1293
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:07.500
my favorite things to,
to watch and be a part of mixed martial arts.
This is like,

1294
01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:08.800
<v 0>okay,</v>

1295
01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.150
<v 2>a historical event to me,
you know,
this is like holy shit,</v>

1296
01:10:13.151 --> 01:10:17.410
like word in the site,
Tama,
Super Rena in Japan where it all went down,
you know.

1297
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:21.190
So it was,
it was,
it had a definitely an extra charge because of that.

1298
01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:24.410
<v 4>Should we call her?
That arena actually expands it.</v>

1299
01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:29.400
You can make it bigger or smaller or comes up to rise.

1300
01:10:29.610 --> 01:10:33.570
The uh,
the sides expand.
Yeah.
It's like super fucking high tech man.

1301
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:37.620
It was also weird seeing all the animation like I had said like,
look,

1302
01:10:37.621 --> 01:10:39.720
keep your eye out for the animation or is animation everywhere.

1303
01:10:39.721 --> 01:10:41.190
I know he's like everywhere,
everywhere.

1304
01:10:41.191 --> 01:10:43.470
Everywhere you looked there was the little cartoons.
Yeah.

1305
01:10:43.471 --> 01:10:46.110
Well you should say cartoons on animation.
Yeah,
that makes sense.
Motion.

1306
01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:50.700
But everywhere where people have businesses,
they have like a cartoon pickle.

1307
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:55.170
Yeah.
You know,
that runs their business or a kitty cat or cats or cats.

1308
01:10:55.410 --> 01:10:58.970
Bears like teddy bears like that run you in,
you know your,
your,

1309
01:10:58.971 --> 01:11:01.580
your company is represented by a big smiley teddy bear.
Yeah.

1310
01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:03.540
And even like the description on the toilet,

1311
01:11:03.541 --> 01:11:06.780
like you know shit like a kid like reaching in there and there'd be like this

1312
01:11:06.781 --> 01:11:11.280
cartoon of the character crying and stuff with the cartoon and telling you not

1313
01:11:11.281 --> 01:11:14.550
to like stick your mouth on the toilet seat where the water comes out.

1314
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.210
They don't want anybody hovering their head over and just drinking this shit

1315
01:11:18.211 --> 01:11:21.510
water.
Oh God.
Yeah,
because who knows?

1316
01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:25.710
I mean if you take a giant dump on the jets,
just some monster dump,
you know,

1317
01:11:25.711 --> 01:11:29.430
maybe some of that shit's still sticks to the little little hose.

1318
01:11:29.431 --> 01:11:31.230
It doesn't quite got it all off.

1319
01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.050
And then your kids in their Jenkin and out of it like a fountain and they get

1320
01:11:34.051 --> 01:11:38.370
some horrible disease is awesome having your poop in their mouth.

1321
01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:41.300
It's also weird seeing it that that Starbucks cups,

1322
01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.050
like everything was smaller in Japan,

1323
01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:47.970
like the Venti iced coffee in America,
you know,
he's like,
I don't know,

1324
01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:52.770
it's like a size 20 ounces or 20 ounces.
Yeah,
they're,
the Vinci was a small,

1325
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.850
what we have as a small event,
he coffee is just fucking crank.

1326
01:11:56.851 --> 01:12:00.150
You might as well just go take crank.
You get a Venti Starbucks.

1327
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:03.270
Somebody might as well just give you a line.
I don't even,
I get Trenta.

1328
01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.970
I could turn to add shots every day.
Every single day.

1329
01:12:06.971 --> 01:12:10.470
So Trent is 30 ounces of ice coffee and with shot two shots.

1330
01:12:10.471 --> 01:12:13.500
Usually every day you're like numb to caffeine.
Huh?

1331
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:16.830
I just did that once and that wastes me right the fuck up.

1332
01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:20.250
That groggy part in the morning.
I want to be awake.

1333
01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:22.010
I wouldn't be able to drink a beverage and be like,
alright,

1334
01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:26.330
you know what you should do just out man.
Perform a series of exercises,

1335
01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:27.750
forced yourself to do chin ups,

1336
01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:31.940
push ups and body weight squats every morning you'll wake right the fuck up in

1337
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:33.570
Jujitsu with a gay guy.
You don't have to

1338
01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.730
Chesney,
you just do a little bit at 30 minutes.

1339
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:42.540
Gj Etsy with a gay guy or make sure you keep your base,

1340
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:47.370
make sure you don't want to take you back.
I kept on thinking,
oh wait,

1341
01:12:47.371 --> 01:12:50.540
we already talked about this and now what?
Never mind.
We'll deal.
Tell me now.

1342
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:51.940
I want to say it now.

1343
01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:56.540
It was really cool having that dude from house of pain and they're,

1344
01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:00.270
my friends growing up were just huge house of Payne fans.
That's all.

1345
01:13:00.271 --> 01:13:03.530
They listened to it nonstop and smoked weed.
Like he's very connected with the,

1346
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:08.190
the weed.
Uh,
uh,
what do you think?
Are you talking about?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1347
01:13:08.191 --> 01:13:12.630
I meant Berio.
Oh,
did I say a pain?
Oh,
you meant Cypress.
Cypress Hill.
I'm sorry.

1348
01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:16.800
Yeah,
you silly fucked are not the same.
I know.
I get them confused and racist.

1349
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:19.110
I get them.
Why do you get them confused?
I don't know.
They just,

1350
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:23.170
same timeline when they can kind of came at the same time.
The kind of had that,

1351
01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:25.890
they used to have the kind of the same sounds,
you know,

1352
01:13:25.891 --> 01:13:29.640
like I used to mix them up a lot.
I've done that before with Blake,

1353
01:13:29.641 --> 01:13:32.660
one 82 and someone else,
I forget who the other bands,
like

1354
01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:38.490
green day,
they're all together.
To me,
just the names.
I don't know what it it was.

1355
01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:40.410
Obviously,
I know they've totally different music,

1356
01:13:40.411 --> 01:13:42.360
but the names every now and then for whatever reason,

1357
01:13:42.361 --> 01:13:44.160
you have a a misfire and your brain,

1358
01:13:44.161 --> 01:13:48.210
you've connected someone with the wrong person for like a couple of months and

1359
01:13:48.211 --> 01:13:50.130
then you have to relearn it and when you relearn it,

1360
01:13:50.131 --> 01:13:53.550
sometimes it doesn't take like,
what about Ho?
Okay.
Oh yeah,
that's the,

1361
01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.290
that's the other band.
That's the other band.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
What's the other band?

1362
01:13:58.291 --> 01:14:02.700
That band that used to sing out?
Take me past the breakers.
Watch through.

1363
01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:07.950
Oh yeah,
we can.
Oh Man,

1364
01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:11.710
I'm fucking dying over here.
They were great.
That was a song.

1365
01:14:11.711 --> 01:14:13.530
Santa Monica Everclear

1366
01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:17.800
<v 1>on it.
Everything.
I got him mixed up with Everlast alive.
Oh yeah.</v>

1367
01:14:17.801 --> 01:14:19.150
Well I can see how that would happen.

1368
01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:23.530
That guy had some bad ass fucking music though.
I love that guy.
Where's that guy?

1369
01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:27.010
And I know he bleached his hair a lot though.
I wonder if he's still bleaches.

1370
01:14:27.011 --> 01:14:30.220
It probably overdosed on Pussy.
That song was too good for a man like that.

1371
01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.430
She's out there with that fucking awesome song in the world.
You know,

1372
01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:34.900
out of nowhere,
boom,

1373
01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:40.180
a tsunami of hot pussy comes at you because if you're wonderful music probably

1374
01:14:40.181 --> 01:14:42.370
couldn't handle it.
Who could blame the Fella?

1375
01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:47.950
That's what I always assume when anything happens in a dude gets off track.

1376
01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:50.380
You know like someone who you really used to enjoy it and they get off track.

1377
01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:54.070
You always feel like it's some Jen Michael Vincent tsunami of Pussy.

1378
01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:58.120
I just threw them off track.
Partied way too hard,

1379
01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.690
go way too fucked up.
You know,

1380
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:06.730
that's the argument that the people that are in counseling and in rehabilitation

1381
01:15:06.731 --> 01:15:10.780
for alcohol and drugs,
that's the argument that these people will always use.

1382
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:15.990
So people that fall apart is the people that take whatever and just blow their

1383
01:15:16.361 --> 01:15:17.350
fucking heads out.

1384
01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:23.050
What they're missing is how many people are making life so much more
interesting.

1385
01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:27.670
Can you imagine how much less interesting life would be if you were sober all

1386
01:15:27.671 --> 01:15:29.980
the time?
Do you not understand?
Like,

1387
01:15:29.981 --> 01:15:34.981
it's just some people that have never had a drunk fuck with their ex girlfriend

1388
01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:40.000
or you're like 23 years old and you text her in the middle of the night and she

1389
01:15:40.001 --> 01:15:43.120
responds and you're like,
what are you doing?
You dirty bitch.

1390
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.970
And she responds back,
I'm waiting for you to come over here and fuck me.

1391
01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:50.860
And you're like,
oh shit,
it's on.
And you go there and you're like,
you know,

1392
01:15:50.861 --> 01:15:54.070
you probably been broken up for a long time.
You never expected a fuck her.

1393
01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:58.030
And on top of it,
she's just as drunk as you.
I need this.

1394
01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:59.860
And this doesn't mean anything.
No,
it's telling me nothing.

1395
01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.990
It's not mean we're getting back together.
Nope,
nope,

1396
01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:06.220
we're just doing this right and boom,
you don't do that without being drunk.

1397
01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:08.410
That's one of the most beautiful moments in life.

1398
01:16:08.411 --> 01:16:10.180
And you don't even get there without being drunk.

1399
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.330
Cause if you're not drunk and you go this and she's just not for what I'm

1400
01:16:13.331 --> 01:16:14.470
looking for right now.

1401
01:16:14.471 --> 01:16:16.510
And even though my emotions are telling me to go visit her,

1402
01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:19.960
my rational mind is saying,
this is just,
this is not a smart move.

1403
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.960
I got to just move on.
I've got to be positive.
I'm got to get my shit done.

1404
01:16:23.170 --> 01:16:27.580
You have a couple shots of Jack Daniels.
You start fucking thinking crazy.

1405
01:16:27.581 --> 01:16:31.090
You have a Tequila.
You want to do one more with Tequila.
I'm not scared.

1406
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:34.780
And that Fourth Tequila hits.
Boom.
Let me just text this pitch real quick.

1407
01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:39.700
Do you have any,
people would not have that moment if it wasn't for alcohol.

1408
01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:41.680
So how could you say?
Just because a few people die.

1409
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:44.020
The rest of us shouldn't live awesome.
Alives

1410
01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:50.200
flavored by alcohol.
You know a lot of the fun shit that happens,

1411
01:16:50.201 --> 01:16:53.620
it's flavored by alcohol.
People need to accept it.
It's a great drug.

1412
01:16:53.621 --> 01:16:55.600
It's not the best.
No it's not.

1413
01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:58.780
But it's good for a lot of shit and it makes things fun sometimes.

1414
01:16:58.870 --> 01:17:02.030
It definitely opens up doors that you normally wouldn't open because here,

1415
01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:06.610
whatever reason,
that's why you're dancing.
I'm fabbing a fucking great time too,

1416
01:17:06.611 --> 01:17:09.980
by the way.
Dancing,
having a great time,
you know,

1417
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:15.110
<v 4>laughing your ass off high five and your friends,
you know,
hammered.
It's not bad.</v>

1418
01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:18.350
It's not bad.
You gotta be careful of your health.
Okay?

1419
01:17:18.351 --> 01:17:19.770
You've got to drink a lot of water.
You've got gotta.

1420
01:17:19.771 --> 01:17:22.790
Make sure you don't do it too often.
You don't want to jolt your system.

1421
01:17:22.791 --> 01:17:25.550
You want to give yourself plenty of time to recover.
Take your vitamins.

1422
01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:29.780
But every now and then,
don't be a pussy.
Have a drink.
Come on man.

1423
01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:33.000
Just a little shoddy pool here or there.

1424
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:37.790
One of the things I always respected about Anthony Bordain quit heroin to equip

1425
01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:42.650
booze.
I blacked out in Japan every night.
I was there.
I think I fucking,

1426
01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:48.230
I went super deep.
I got disciplined son.
I know how to use it.

1427
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:51.020
I know when it's time for me to get drunk.

1428
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:54.140
I was doing the robot and then packed night club in your hand just because I

1429
01:17:54.141 --> 01:17:59.060
knew no one would say shit to me.
I,
uh,

1430
01:17:59.130 --> 01:18:01.790
my,
my time was so,
I was so fucked up.

1431
01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:05.000
Like we just got in for folks who don't realize we've got an yesterday.

1432
01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:09.560
We're the only last time.
I didn't feel it going there,
but I feel it coming back.

1433
01:18:09.561 --> 01:18:13.910
Like I was talking yesterday.
I just couldn't.
I woke up today at 7:00 AM.
Yeah,

1434
01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:18.080
it's completely confusing.
Your brain is like,
what is going down here?
It takes,

1435
01:18:18.081 --> 01:18:20.090
you know what's helped,
what helps Melatonin.

1436
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:24.230
Melatonin is great for resetting you.
It's a,
it's a natural thing.

1437
01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:29.320
It's natural but don't go to Dubai with it cause you being arrested sleeping's

1438
01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.570
thing.
Yeah,
both.
It's a natural supplement.
I don't know how they make it.

1439
01:18:32.571 --> 01:18:33.980
I say it.
I'm saying it's a natural supplements.

1440
01:18:33.981 --> 01:18:35.750
If I fucking looked into it deeply,

1441
01:18:35.751 --> 01:18:38.570
but quite honestly I've just used it as green tea extract,

1442
01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:44.060
but that has caffeine in it.
Brian White series for relaxation.

1443
01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:48.020
Do you really for sleeping but okay.
You relaxed with caffeine.

1444
01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:49.580
You just drink so much caffeine.

1445
01:18:49.581 --> 01:18:53.000
The caffeine that's in green tea like can't fuck with the shit that you get from

1446
01:18:53.001 --> 01:18:57.220
a 30 ounce Starbucks.
Green tea extra.
What's it called?
It's not green tea.

1447
01:18:57.230 --> 01:19:00.680
It's the,
it's the other one.
It's,
uh,
some leaf,

1448
01:19:00.681 --> 01:19:04.580
some leaf green leaf x.
You don't even know where you'd take.

1449
01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:07.670
He just grabbed things and barely stay awake and just take them.

1450
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:10.010
I buy my shit on Amazon and just keep on rebuying it.

1451
01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:12.590
Have you ever thought it would get none like Adderall or some shit just to see

1452
01:19:12.591 --> 01:19:16.960
if it's for you Adderall now I don't think I need that.
Well,

1453
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.480
I might need it a little bit,
but I,
I've tried Adderall before and it just was,

1454
01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:24.710
it just felt like cocaine to me.
Really?
Yeah.
I didn't help anything.

1455
01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:30.530
If you went to a doctor though,
I bet they'd give it to you.
Yeah.
But see you,

1456
01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:34.720
you've experienced me mostly super stoned out of your mind.

1457
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:39.160
Like retarded stone.
I just smoked like,
I don't know how much weed.
Well,

1458
01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:42.630
we had to,
we had to hold up.
I mean,
when you're willing to represent we,

1459
01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:46.250
we were having a podcast with be real from cyber sale.
There's,
I'd love be real.

1460
01:19:46.251 --> 01:19:47.084
He's,
he's,

1461
01:19:47.170 --> 01:19:50.600
he and we had classic stoner conversation and talking about things that scared

1462
01:19:50.601 --> 01:19:55.010
the fuck out of us talking about a crazy animals.
And other countries.

1463
01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.780
Where are you going fella?
Oh,
well you just got up in the middle of his talking.

1464
01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.400
Didn't even say I'm going to go get some water.

1465
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:04.670
So for folks who are tuned into this and like what happened to the other part of

1466
01:20:04.671 --> 01:20:08.070
the podcast,
the be real podcasts accidentally got

1467
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:12.000
<v 1>onto red bands channel,
you know,
no big deal.</v>

1468
01:20:12.001 --> 01:20:16.830
He just fucked up again.
But it's all right.
And um,
it,

1469
01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.390
so it's,
but it's totally going to be available.
It just,
you,

1470
01:20:19.391 --> 01:20:22.950
you can't watch it live obviously cause it's over.

1471
01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:28.170
But it'll be available on the Ustream page and then also be available on the

1472
01:20:28.171 --> 01:20:32.550
Vimeo page,
which is a whatever it is.

1473
01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:36.480
What does it Vimeo slash calm Joe Rogan.
Just go to your website.

1474
01:20:36.481 --> 01:20:38.010
That's where you find all the videos.
Yeah.

1475
01:20:38.011 --> 01:20:39.900
Go to jail rather gun that you can find everything.
Um,

1476
01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:44.780
we hung out with the starter and a owner and a way.
I mean,
what does he have?

1477
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.560
He's a founder of Ustream.
Yeah,
he was cool.
Yeah.
Brad was an Ohio state Buckeye.

1478
01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:53.610
Yeah.
Very good dude.
He was.
He was,
he was fun guy to hang out with.

1479
01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:57.000
Wish we had more time to hang out with them.
It was cool.
I wish I had more time.

1480
01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:00.720
We'll meet him again.
He's think so.
Wow.
That'd be awesome.

1481
01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.370
I also don't want to say you.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
What secrets?
No.

1482
01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:09.120
Can I smoke some weed from this new bond?
No,
I'm scared.

1483
01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:12.660
That's the jet pipe thing.
Why would you want more weed right now?
What?

1484
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:15.200
That doesn't even make sense unless you're trying to do some product
endorsement.

1485
01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:19.320
The send it.
We'll just tell everybody about it.
Then the jet water pipe,

1486
01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:22.080
this is a bond that these two guys that are,

1487
01:21:22.081 --> 01:21:25.050
I think two guys are friends and they decided to start a company and so they

1488
01:21:25.051 --> 01:21:27.530
made this,
we talked about before it made like a tight,

1489
01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:30.330
a Dyson vacuum cleaner type bong.

1490
01:21:30.331 --> 01:21:33.360
Like meaning they just engineered it really well and like when you hit it you

1491
01:21:33.361 --> 01:21:35.370
don't take pull it.
You like push it down.

1492
01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.460
Well what it is is you don't have to put your finger over a whole anymore.

1493
01:21:38.461 --> 01:21:43.230
They've figured out a way to do it.
Like mechanically with a little spring.

1494
01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:46.610
The only question that I had was that the bowl was made out of,
uh,

1495
01:21:46.650 --> 01:21:50.340
what does that stuff,
what is the stuff that bowls made out of?
I don't know.

1496
01:21:50.341 --> 01:21:53.730
It's interesting.
It's acrylic,
right?
It's something weird.
Yeah.

1497
01:21:53.731 --> 01:21:58.200
I would say acrylic was that all came to light on fire and smoke.
I would wonder.

1498
01:21:58.410 --> 01:22:02.370
I'm sure probably figured that out.
I would hope,
but I don't know.
You know,

1499
01:22:02.371 --> 01:22:06.390
you never know.
And the other one,
the other question would be if they didn't,

1500
01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:09.660
would it be possible to make something that would fit in there that was made out

1501
01:22:09.661 --> 01:22:13.860
of glass where you wouldn't have that issue because somebody brought that up.

1502
01:22:13.861 --> 01:22:16.170
I didn't even think about it.
It's only brought it up on the message board.

1503
01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:20.290
Why wait?
Why wait?
Acrylic,
be bad.
Delight them.

1504
01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:24.540
It's plastic.
Or why would it be good or the melted plastic?
Well,

1505
01:22:24.541 --> 01:22:27.270
I don't think it melts.
I think that's the point of what God,

1506
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:30.480
but what if it gets some sort of a chemical residue on your marijuana?

1507
01:22:30.481 --> 01:22:33.700
Is that possible?
I think it is.
Choose that.
If it was you,

1508
01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.460
I would say they wouldn't either.
But you know,

1509
01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:38.880
sometimes it takes a long time before people find out things do fucked up things

1510
01:22:38.881 --> 01:22:40.920
to them.
Like for instance,

1511
01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:44.980
it took them a while before they figured out that if you have um,

1512
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:50.030
plastic bottles of water and they are in the sun that it actually can or you

1513
01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:54.840
like doing that on camera so that you uh,
so what I got a license.
They look cool.

1514
01:22:55.010 --> 01:22:55.300
No,

1515
01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:58.570
I was just showing the release thing so I didn't have to pull out the pipe like

1516
01:22:58.610 --> 01:23:03.000
a nice I normal bomb what he's saying it for the folks that are only listened to

1517
01:23:03.001 --> 01:23:06.400
this on audio instead it's got some sort of a thing in the bottom where you can

1518
01:23:06.401 --> 01:23:08.930
clear out the whole bong by hitting a little pull down.

1519
01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:13.720
She got a little little lever.
But,
um,
I mean I would assume that if it,
if,

1520
01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:16.270
if sun and bottled water,

1521
01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:20.530
if the the plastic and admit chemicals and then it gets in your bottled water

1522
01:23:20.531 --> 01:23:21.610
when you leave it in the sun,

1523
01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:27.210
then I would think that if you're heating up we'd over some plastic or acrylic,

1524
01:23:27.581 --> 01:23:30.760
whatever.
I mean a technically plastic.
I guess it is what it is.

1525
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:33.010
I don't know what it is either but I would think that that's not good.

1526
01:23:33.610 --> 01:23:34.443
I didn't even think of it

1527
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:39.200
<v 3>by the way that the company on their website says that uh,
that the,</v>

1528
01:23:39.230 --> 01:23:42.150
the bowl is ceramic code in and it works fine with the f.

1529
01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:47.220
You could also have 14 millimeter glass on glass attachments so that they tell

1530
01:23:47.681 --> 01:23:49.270
you that the size of the attachment,

1531
01:23:49.271 --> 01:23:51.630
you can actually put glass attachments on there if you want to do

1532
01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:53.450
<v 1>problem solved.
There you go.
Yeah.</v>

1533
01:23:53.451 --> 01:23:55.880
I would think that glass would be the way to do it cause you know the glass is

1534
01:23:55.881 --> 01:23:59.240
not going to melt into some residue.

1535
01:23:59.330 --> 01:24:01.340
It's an amazing that they make glass with fucking heat.

1536
01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.650
Think about how God damn hot it has to be.
You know,

1537
01:24:03.651 --> 01:24:06.710
when's the last time you saw a glass milk?
Cause you had a,
a candle over it,

1538
01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:10.310
you know,
it would be hot as fuck to melt glass.

1539
01:24:12.170 --> 01:24:15.260
<v 3>Oh and I was thinking about the amino acid found in green tea earlier that I</v>

1540
01:24:15.261 --> 01:24:19.520
take.
It's I think,
I mean so it's an extract.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1541
01:24:19.950 --> 01:24:21.600
<v 1>that's what I was thinking.
I'd never heard of that.</v>

1542
01:24:21.601 --> 01:24:23.610
But melatonin and apparently there's a woman,

1543
01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:26.730
I think she was a executive of Brillstein gray,
something like that,

1544
01:24:26.731 --> 01:24:29.770
some big like production company or something like that.
And she was uh,

1545
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:35.390
going over to Dubai for business and she got arrested for having Melatonin in

1546
01:24:36.151 --> 01:24:36.990
her suitcase.

1547
01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:42.500
Like they viewed Melatonin as a drug and another guy got arrested cause there

1548
01:24:42.511 --> 01:24:45.570
was some sort of an issue,
um,
with his visa.

1549
01:24:45.571 --> 01:24:50.550
So they made him take a drug test and he tested positive for poppy seeds because

1550
01:24:50.551 --> 01:24:55.320
he had a Bagel,
a poppy seed Bagel.
And that's testing positive for heroin,

1551
01:24:55.730 --> 01:24:59.910
poppy and heroin.
Like you can be arrested.
Poppy seed.

1552
01:24:59.950 --> 01:25:02.820
<v 3>Yeah.
Having it like this.</v>

1553
01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.130
I forget the lady who got some Olympic Cic,

1554
01:25:06.131 --> 01:25:10.420
I think I where she ate like two or three bagels a day or something like that.

1555
01:25:10.421 --> 01:25:11.780
And that's why she came up for that.

1556
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:14.180
<v 1>True.
Brian.
I think the new sophisticated tests,</v>

1557
01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:18.650
well this was like 10 years ago when this happened.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
But anyway,

1558
01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:19.401
whatever it happened,

1559
01:25:19.401 --> 01:25:23.060
this guy got in trouble for a poppy seed Bagel and then another guy got arrested

1560
01:25:23.061 --> 01:25:26.930
because he had a particle of weeds stuck to the bottom of his shoe and they

1561
01:25:26.931 --> 01:25:30.790
detected it.
Some Rastafarian looking dude and they,
they,
uh,

1562
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:33.050
arrested him like he do not fuck around.

1563
01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:35.360
And some countries when it comes to their drug laws,

1564
01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:38.210
so don't be going over there with Melatonin.

1565
01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:41.140
<v 3>Isn't it weird that like we don't take off our shoes.</v>

1566
01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:44.420
Like we walk around and we step on shit.
We step on weed,
we step on needles,

1567
01:25:44.421 --> 01:25:47.000
we stepped on everything and then we go and step on our carpet and then we have

1568
01:25:47.001 --> 01:25:50.960
our kids climb on that carpet with no nothing on it.
That crazy.

1569
01:25:50.961 --> 01:25:54.020
That's why Japanese take off their shoes and their houses are smarter than their

1570
01:25:54.021 --> 01:25:54.331
house.
I mean,

1571
01:25:54.331 --> 01:25:58.460
well they're all walking around with masks on and that's smarter is it?
Yeah,
no.

1572
01:25:58.461 --> 01:26:00.320
Do you know why?
Remember?
Yeah,
yeah.

1573
01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:03.830
But for folks who don't know because they road works with us,
um,

1574
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.380
<v 4>they planted a lot according to our driver.
This is,</v>

1575
01:26:06.381 --> 01:26:09.380
and we've done no outside research whatsoever,

1576
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:11.930
but he said the reason why all these people were wearing surgical masks,

1577
01:26:11.931 --> 01:26:15.680
a big part of it was hay fever that they got from Cedar Allergies,

1578
01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:18.500
like Hay fever or some sort of a cedar allergy.

1579
01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:23.740
And that Cedar trees were introduced to Japan after World War II and 30% as many

1580
01:26:24.981 --> 01:26:27.920
as 30% of Japanese people are allergic to Cedar.

1581
01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:30.890
And that's because they burn in the ward.

1582
01:26:30.891 --> 01:26:34.430
They burned down in their houses and you had the big fire of Japan and they had

1583
01:26:34.431 --> 01:26:35.980
to rebuild other houses.
I think they,

1584
01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:39.800
they planted those trees did because they had too many houses to,
to read,

1585
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:41.600
to make and people are allergic to Cedar.

1586
01:26:41.601 --> 01:26:44.780
It's really crazy also that it was because,
uh,

1587
01:26:44.781 --> 01:26:46.970
they also feel that like if you have a code,

1588
01:26:46.971 --> 01:26:49.320
like if you are going to work sneezing Alito,

1589
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:52.910
that you should wear one that's your responsibility and it's,
it's uh,

1590
01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:55.850
it's rude if you sneeze without one of these on.

1591
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:57.810
So that's why it's weird walking around.

1592
01:26:57.850 --> 01:27:02.270
It's like probably 30 or 40% of the people look like they just had this mass on.

1593
01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:06.290
Oh yeah.
There was a weird,
it was very different than us.
They're like,
again,

1594
01:27:06.291 --> 01:27:07.640
their,
their culture is like,

1595
01:27:07.641 --> 01:27:09.920
you have to take care of your own shit and you're much more polite.

1596
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:14.150
We saw no homeless people whatsoever.
None.
Zero.
It was really interesting.

1597
01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:17.330
And the cops are on these little stations and they just sit at a desk,

1598
01:27:17.331 --> 01:27:18.200
like a help desk.

1599
01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:21.020
Like kind of like when you go to a mall and they have like that little desk

1600
01:27:21.021 --> 01:27:23.340
where you can,
you know,
that's kind of like,
I got lost at one,

1601
01:27:23.341 --> 01:27:26.840
one point and I wasted,
went to this cop and he drew me a map.

1602
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:28.190
He spoke no English.

1603
01:27:28.191 --> 01:27:32.060
I spoke no Japanese and he knew what I was trying to do and sent me to the wrong

1604
01:27:32.061 --> 01:27:35.060
hotel and I walked two extra miles.
But uh,

1605
01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:39.590
he still spent the time to draw me a map to the wrong hotel at least.
Yeah.
No,

1606
01:27:39.591 --> 01:27:44.120
they're super helpful.
It's different.
Why don't you fucking move to,
I would,

1607
01:27:44.121 --> 01:27:48.950
I wouldn't move to Japan.
You won't gave floaters and you want to live in Japan.

1608
01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:53.270
Go Big in Japan.
We met a lot of podcast fans that lived in Japan,

1609
01:27:53.271 --> 01:27:56.120
which has a lot of people that came to the fights.

1610
01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:59.090
That's one of the coolest things about the podcast.
It's available everywhere.

1611
01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:02.660
It's free.
Get,
it's not,
you know,
it's not a reach.

1612
01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.610
We will make it as available as possible.

1613
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:07.370
So glad that we did that because it totally turned out to be the right move.

1614
01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:09.020
My mom saw me on TV.

1615
01:28:09.021 --> 01:28:12.860
My mom was flipping through the channels and just happened to me on the fights

1616
01:28:12.861 --> 01:28:17.810
and the audience on like spike or not affects,
what is it on now?
Yeah,
FX.
Fx.

1617
01:28:17.811 --> 01:28:20.300
And she went,
my mom's like,
Holy Shit.
That's Brian Wright on the TV,

1618
01:28:20.301 --> 01:28:23.720
and so she watched me.
But what's so funny is how quiet it was,

1619
01:28:23.721 --> 01:28:26.180
and it's one of the fans though,
red band,

1620
01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.220
and it was like everybody could hear it in the whole place.

1621
01:28:28.221 --> 01:28:31.700
He goes all of garden and the whole thing.
Everyone heard that.

1622
01:28:31.730 --> 01:28:34.880
That's how quiet was it?
Yeah,
you don't really,
you,

1623
01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:38.210
you could not imagine if you've never been to a Japanese sporting event,

1624
01:28:38.211 --> 01:28:41.870
how quiet it can be while the fight is going on,
how respectful they are.

1625
01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:46.040
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
I love,
would you,
do you want to go back to Japan?

1626
01:28:46.041 --> 01:28:49.020
I would do it,
but I like Brazil too,
man.
Brazil,
they go nuts.
We,

1627
01:28:49.021 --> 01:28:53.000
I did lots of wild too.
I don't know,
man.
Brazil was fun.
People were very nice to,

1628
01:28:53.001 --> 01:28:57.350
food was fantastic.
People were really fun and friendly.
It was a total opposite.

1629
01:28:57.351 --> 01:29:01.980
As far as like the outgoingness people are very outgoing and although very

1630
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:06.780
<v 2>friendly as well in Brazil,
just much more outgoing and loud and having fun,</v>

1631
01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:11.430
laughing a lot.
I might have more fun in Brazil than in Japan.
I'm on team Japan.

1632
01:29:13.530 --> 01:29:13.861
Brazil,

1633
01:29:13.861 --> 01:29:16.560
they're not going to make you cover every tattoos if you want to go swimming.

1634
01:29:16.561 --> 01:29:17.880
You know what I'm saying?
They're more laid back.

1635
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:21.840
It's more of my kind of place and although Japan was amazing,
you know,

1636
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:23.970
but the overall look overall,

1637
01:29:23.971 --> 01:29:26.430
one of the things about traveling and one of the things that I find that when I

1638
01:29:26.431 --> 01:29:30.870
come back,
it's America is the shit,
what a great place to live.

1639
01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:33.960
There's so much cool stuff here as far as like cool,

1640
01:29:33.961 --> 01:29:37.650
like bands to see cool art,
to see cool comics,

1641
01:29:37.651 --> 01:29:40.440
to see cool movies every way you go.
By the way,

1642
01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:43.230
they're fucking American movies that are dubbed over in other countries.

1643
01:29:43.231 --> 01:29:45.150
I mean in Japan we went to the movie theater.

1644
01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:48.720
It was like four out of five movies were American movies that had been dubbed

1645
01:29:48.721 --> 01:29:51.750
over in Japanese and all the posters were slightly changed.
Like,

1646
01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.660
like the mission impossible poster looks slightly changed.

1647
01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:57.720
I think that would make it look more like he was Japanese and stuff.

1648
01:29:57.721 --> 01:30:01.390
It was awesome.
Well it was a little bit in the shadows a little bit,
but he like,

1649
01:30:01.890 --> 01:30:06.570
it's fucking awesome.
Awesome hanging out there.
No doubt.

1650
01:30:06.690 --> 01:30:09.690
But America is my favorite fucking country ever.

1651
01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:13.410
Even though it's fucked up and corrupt and filled with Conn's at the very top

1652
01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:16.950
what it embodies as far as like what we're capable of producing.

1653
01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:22.170
You know America produces some fucking fun shit.
A lot of fun art man.

1654
01:30:22.190 --> 01:30:23.730
Like,
like I told you when I see,

1655
01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:26.580
when I saw honey honey last night I was like God damn,
this is like a,

1656
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:31.020
they're like such an American bad ass creative band.
But it's,

1657
01:30:31.021 --> 01:30:35.130
it's so like the style is so American,
you know,

1658
01:30:35.131 --> 01:30:38.460
there's so many good parts of this country,
you know,

1659
01:30:38.461 --> 01:30:42.000
as far as like as like standup comedy goes and it's like,
you know,

1660
01:30:42.001 --> 01:30:46.020
movies and art work
stop that fine.

1661
01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.620
But we're run by cons.

1662
01:30:51.210 --> 01:30:53.550
It's like you've got to figure out a way to balance that out.

1663
01:30:53.730 --> 01:30:58.200
I wonder if that's the only way you can get so many crazy wild creative people

1664
01:30:58.201 --> 01:31:02.340
in a spot.
You have to have it be run like cuts and the cuts that run it,

1665
01:31:02.341 --> 01:31:06.390
they suppress everybody and every art just blossoms out of that suppression left

1666
01:31:06.391 --> 01:31:08.220
and right.
Because when I go to a place like Japan,

1667
01:31:08.221 --> 01:31:12.630
it's so polite and so nice and they so they're so disciplined and I'm like,
man,

1668
01:31:12.631 --> 01:31:14.310
yeah,
but when was the last time,
you know,

1669
01:31:14.311 --> 01:31:18.000
you saw like how many people were lining up for Japanese standup comedy?
I mean,

1670
01:31:18.001 --> 01:31:20.550
is it,
is it really popular all over the world,
you know,

1671
01:31:20.551 --> 01:31:25.320
is there like master Japanese musicians that we don't know about?
You know,

1672
01:31:25.321 --> 01:31:28.500
I mean is why is it everywhere we're going,
we're listening to American music.

1673
01:31:28.770 --> 01:31:32.250
Is it that the way to get really popular,

1674
01:31:32.610 --> 01:31:36.830
really exciting artwork is to suppress the,
the,

1675
01:31:36.831 --> 01:31:38.310
the youth early on.

1676
01:31:38.311 --> 01:31:41.310
So they're fighting against it and that's where rock and roll comes from a

1677
01:31:41.311 --> 01:31:42.900
rebellion.
And that's where the,

1678
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:46.110
the truth that very few people would have the balls to say.

1679
01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.160
Is that where it comes from?

1680
01:31:47.161 --> 01:31:50.760
Does it come from fighting against someone who suppressing you and does it not

1681
01:31:50.761 --> 01:31:54.060
come naturally when everybody is respectful?
Like the Japanese?
I don't know.

1682
01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.170
I'm just asking.

1683
01:31:55.171 --> 01:31:57.690
I'm just trying to be like a social scientist checking this all out.

1684
01:31:57.691 --> 01:31:59.950
But it is fascinating when you see like

1685
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:03.100
<v 1>there's no way of making a Joey d as in Japan.
You know what I'm saying?</v>

1686
01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:04.323
That would be kind of

1687
01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:08.090
<v 4>Cortisiaga a cock sucker.</v>

1688
01:32:09.810 --> 01:32:14.630
Yeah,
I left not lesson.

1689
01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:17.080
What is the,
we don't care if it's illegal down to your cock sock.

1690
01:32:17.081 --> 01:32:18.930
I know you got it.
No,

1691
01:32:18.970 --> 01:32:22.960
it's 2012 nobody surviving and what are we dog?
Nobody.

1692
01:32:22.961 --> 01:32:24.190
Not any spot on the globe.

1693
01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:31.930
Nice.
Polite as possible.
I'm here to help you.

1694
01:32:32.650 --> 01:32:35.890
That would be funny if he went to a different sounding high,

1695
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:40.540
like his voice got really high to me
as it goes on.

1696
01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:41.261
Yeah.

1697
01:32:41.261 --> 01:32:45.040
That's really sucks that Joey can't go to other countries because of his record

1698
01:32:45.041 --> 01:32:47.030
when he was young.
Can you imagine him in Japan?
That would be

1699
01:32:47.730 --> 01:32:50.460
<v 1>bring him to England.
They would never have them in England and they can't.</v>

1700
01:32:50.461 --> 01:32:54.600
They wouldn't have them in Canada.
No Way.
Cannabis really strict.

1701
01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:59.370
You know Canada is like a boat over a sea of Douche bags,
you know?

1702
01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:03.900
I mean,
and again,
ladies and gentlemen of America,

1703
01:33:03.901 --> 01:33:06.630
I just told you how much I love America.
America is not all Douche bags.

1704
01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:09.270
It's a small percentage,
but there's a lot of us.

1705
01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:10.830
So if there's 300 million people in,

1706
01:33:10.831 --> 01:33:12.870
10% of the people are douchebags do the math.

1707
01:33:12.871 --> 01:33:15.000
That's a lot of Goddamn Douche bags,
you know?

1708
01:33:15.001 --> 01:33:18.630
Would you want that bubbling underneath you sneaking across the borders to fuck

1709
01:33:18.631 --> 01:33:22.140
your woman light things on fire then sneak back over in the night.

1710
01:33:22.890 --> 01:33:23.723
<v 6>No.</v>

1711
01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:27.690
<v 1>Got To check out people's fucking records and anybody even remotely shady.</v>

1712
01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:32.370
Canada's like,
Nah,
we're good.
We're good.
Drunk driving nap,
nap.

1713
01:33:32.371 --> 01:33:37.230
We're good.
I only did it once.
Yep.
That's okay.
Bye Bye.
I go back home.

1714
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:39.810
Get out of here.
You did your,
you're a crazy person.

1715
01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:44.750
You're affiliated with crazy activity.
You've fucked something up.
Too Bad.

1716
01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.190
We couldn't do comedy in Japan would have been fascinating,

1717
01:33:47.191 --> 01:33:50.400
but we might've got arrested when we started talking about flinging Lowe's on

1718
01:33:50.401 --> 01:33:55.200
the hotel.
Which hotel?
You know,
you talk,

1719
01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:57.270
all the people would be thinking like,
oh my God,

1720
01:33:57.271 --> 01:34:00.030
what if I'm staying in the hotel with this guy's fleeing loads in the walls,

1721
01:34:01.050 --> 01:34:04.800
right?
Breast.
You don't say that,
Brian.

1722
01:34:05.490 --> 01:34:10.200
Oh No,
I'm responsible for you taking care of your fucking hotel realm.

1723
01:34:10.230 --> 01:34:14.880
It's undermined credit card.
Don't go around Saturday and spine deep file.
Okay.

1724
01:34:14.881 --> 01:34:17.670
Will you make it clear that you didn't cause it goes out on the Internet?

1725
01:34:17.671 --> 01:34:21.060
I definitely did not.
Spiderman in Japan.
Don't ever do that.

1726
01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:25.530
Now when you're staying with me I want to get arrested to the maid walks in at

1727
01:34:25.531 --> 01:34:27.600
the exact moment and she has her.

1728
01:34:27.601 --> 01:34:31.410
I open when your load falls from the ceiling and she doesn't expect and it drops

1729
01:34:31.411 --> 01:34:36.270
right in her eye and she gets I aid street.
Yeah.
Cheat for my face.

1730
01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:41.300
She gets some I aids from your dirty rotten com six hour km long dead sperms.

1731
01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.230
How long has this berms live outside the body and you should find that can

1732
01:34:46.231 --> 01:34:49.950
choose your load on a girl's tits and could she stuffed it in her pussy and get

1733
01:34:49.951 --> 01:34:51.830
pregnant?
Yeah.
See I always wondered about,

1734
01:34:52.230 --> 01:34:56.100
there was definitely times where like in the past where like I would have sex

1735
01:34:56.101 --> 01:34:57.600
and then we need to find that out.
I like,

1736
01:34:57.601 --> 01:35:00.380
I would like take off the condom and just throw it on the ground or something

1737
01:35:00.381 --> 01:35:03.020
like that.
And then I thought like,
I just left her house.

1738
01:35:03.021 --> 01:35:06.170
What if she took that calm and she wanted a baby so much that she just like

1739
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:09.830
starts stuffing it in her pussy and my girl who did that.
Really?
Yeah.

1740
01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:13.110
It was a sister of a girl that I knew.
Yeah.

1741
01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:16.800
<v 2>Did that.
She saved the condom and she uh,</v>

1742
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:20.520
she tried to stuff it back inside of our body.
How long does it last?

1743
01:35:20.521 --> 01:35:23.760
She stuffed it back in and she told her sister she was stopped at her on her

1744
01:35:23.761 --> 01:35:26.690
body after the guy left.
Wow.
Um,

1745
01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:29.940
how long does sperm live after ejaculation?
Let's find out,
shall it?

1746
01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:34.080
It says the lifespan of sperm after ejaculation depends on environmental

1747
01:35:34.081 --> 01:35:34.621
conditions.

1748
01:35:34.621 --> 01:35:38.190
Permit Jack played into a woman's vagina can live in a woman's reproductive

1749
01:35:38.191 --> 01:35:43.150
track for up to five days or perhaps even longer days.

1750
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:47.610
Fertilization is possible as long as the sperm remains alive.

1751
01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:49.180
I need to make bird call.

1752
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:54.450
Jackie waited outside the body may only survive minutes to a few hours,

1753
01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:57.240
may survive only minutes to a few hours.

1754
01:35:57.540 --> 01:36:01.290
So if you've got some crazy survivorman sperm,

1755
01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:05.880
they might be able to last for hours and she could scoop it out of her condom

1756
01:36:05.881 --> 01:36:09.270
and stuff it in her box.
And then you got a baby,
whether you like it or not.

1757
01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:12.890
All she needs is a Turkey baster.
Stick it up in their little twat and,

1758
01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:17.610
and that's it.
So you got to tie up your sperm.
You know what you should do,

1759
01:36:17.611 --> 01:36:19.800
your stove a sacrifice.
You should bring lighter fluid everywhere.

1760
01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:23.510
Every time you fuck.
So it'd be such a bad ass move.
After you fuck a girl,

1761
01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:26.580
you pull a condom off,
he tied at the end,
you throw in the sink,

1762
01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:29.400
lighter fluid on it,
and you'd throw a match on it.

1763
01:36:29.401 --> 01:36:31.170
You walk away with your back to it

1764
01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.490
<v 1>or tie it into the entire night in the condom and just bite it and burst in your</v>

1765
01:36:35.491 --> 01:36:37.470
mouth.
You got to turn your back.
Like that scene in Wolverine,

1766
01:36:37.471 --> 01:36:39.840
we blew up the car behind him.
The explosion,

1767
01:36:39.841 --> 01:36:43.000
like the fear factor demos where they had me like standing there and this

1768
01:36:43.001 --> 01:36:46.200
explosion behind me and I was supposed to look like no big deal.

1769
01:36:46.230 --> 01:36:48.750
That's just an explosion behind me.
Dot.

1770
01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:53.850
I part of what the things that I was doing when I was,
um,
uh,
doing those promos,

1771
01:36:53.851 --> 01:36:55.920
I was doing a couple of them.
I was thinking,
God,

1772
01:36:55.921 --> 01:36:59.790
I can't wait cause if this show gets cancelled,
I have so much new material.

1773
01:37:00.090 --> 01:37:03.930
My God,
it's one of the reasons why I can't wait for two things.
One,

1774
01:37:03.931 --> 01:37:08.090
I can't wait until I start my new special because,
uh,
um,

1775
01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:13.140
on April 20th in Atlanta,
I'm going to,
I've decided I'm going to do that.
Um,
um,

1776
01:37:13.170 --> 01:37:16.290
my,
my special where I'm going to film it.
Yeah.
It should be fun.

1777
01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:19.680
And when I decided that I decided well,

1778
01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:24.600
as soon as fear factors officially fucking totally,
absolutely.

1779
01:37:25.230 --> 01:37:27.060
When will you know it?
When I think it is,

1780
01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:30.240
I think I've gotten an email from them saying that it is,

1781
01:37:30.241 --> 01:37:32.850
but I don't know if I can talk shit about it yet.
I don't know.

1782
01:37:32.851 --> 01:37:37.680
Probably like a three year cause no,
I have to find out and it wouldn't be shit.

1783
01:37:37.710 --> 01:37:40.170
I mean negative shit,
but it would be,
uh,

1784
01:37:40.230 --> 01:37:44.410
there's so many interesting things to talk about
though.

1785
01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:47.940
It was a fascinating thing to do that this,

1786
01:37:47.941 --> 01:37:51.660
this was one of the weirder seasons.
Like while I was doing a lot of things,

1787
01:37:51.661 --> 01:37:53.670
I was like,
wow,
I can't wait to talk about this.
This one's,

1788
01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:58.350
this is fucking nuts behind the scene.
That's all of it.
Just weird.

1789
01:37:58.950 --> 01:38:03.570
So fucking weird gig man.
To do it again after five years was so surreal.

1790
01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:06.720
And if it's not cancer,
it's not canceled.

1791
01:38:06.721 --> 01:38:09.120
I'm going to be forced to do more of them.
You know,

1792
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:13.920
I'd be happy just to have everybody back together and do a show that I think

1793
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:17.520
some people liked.
But if it doesn't do it,
I'm happy with that too.
I actually,

1794
01:38:18.330 --> 01:38:20.370
even though it's a great job,
it's still a job.

1795
01:38:20.371 --> 01:38:22.380
Like there's such a difference between doing a podcast,

1796
01:38:22.381 --> 01:38:27.360
doing standup comedy and doing the UFC and then going and doing a job.
You know,

1797
01:38:27.361 --> 01:38:30.330
when you go and do a job,
it's like,
it's awesome to have this job.
Like Holy Shit,

1798
01:38:30.331 --> 01:38:32.070
what a great job.
But man,

1799
01:38:32.071 --> 01:38:35.760
there's nothing like live in a life where you just follow your passions.

1800
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:38.930
And one of the things I started realizing when I started doing Fairfax,

1801
01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:42.720
I was like,
damn,
I heard he had it nailed.
I already had it where I was like,

1802
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:47.250
everything I was doing I enjoyed.
I wasn't really working.
I was just at my time,

1803
01:38:47.251 --> 01:38:51.300
was committed doing all this cool stuff,
but in fact,
none of it was working,

1804
01:38:51.570 --> 01:38:55.440
you know?
Although I,
you know,
I take my job at the UFC very seriously and I,

1805
01:38:55.441 --> 01:38:58.440
it's an honor to work then I love calling fights.
I don't even,

1806
01:38:58.650 --> 01:39:03.000
I don't even like other sports.
That's how much I love doing it.
It's still,

1807
01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:08.280
when,
when,
when I get there and do it,
it never feels like work.
Never.

1808
01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:10.360
It's,
it's like it,

1809
01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:13.500
there's never a moment when like a fight about to begin where I wish I was

1810
01:39:13.501 --> 01:39:17.940
somewhere else.
It's so fucking fun and crazy,
you know?

1811
01:39:17.941 --> 01:39:21.390
So to be able to do that.
That's a job.
And then stand up comedy.
Same thing.

1812
01:39:21.391 --> 01:39:24.810
I mean,
how much fun is stand up,
you know?
It's that you're doing it now.

1813
01:39:24.811 --> 01:39:29.760
You know what it's like.
It's fun as hell.
The,
the act of making people laugh,

1814
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:33.000
you're making them feel better.
You're making them happy,

1815
01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:36.840
you're giving them like a charge of good energy,
you know?

1816
01:39:36.930 --> 01:39:40.650
And I'm addicted to it too,
but there's nothing more fun than watching.

1817
01:39:40.651 --> 01:39:45.060
Like your friends kill and you're fucking howling at some new bit and you're

1818
01:39:45.061 --> 01:39:49.290
like,
oh shit.
Did you hear his new bit?
Like Dunkin fucking floor to me?

1819
01:39:49.291 --> 01:39:50.550
I don't want to say the bit,

1820
01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:53.970
I don't want to say the bit because I want people to see it this weekend and I

1821
01:39:53.971 --> 01:39:55.980
want to,
I don't want to even give up the premise because it's one of those,

1822
01:39:55.981 --> 01:39:58.620
when you start giving up the premise,
you give up a lot of the power of the joke,

1823
01:39:59.010 --> 01:40:02.280
but God damn,
I heard it and I was like,
holy fuck,
that's good.

1824
01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:07.380
I love comedy.
So most fun fucking thing.
It really is.

1825
01:40:07.381 --> 01:40:11.430
We're so lucky.
It makes you wonder for in the Matrix,
it makes you wonder,

1826
01:40:11.670 --> 01:40:12.001
you know,

1827
01:40:12.001 --> 01:40:16.410
maybe we're like Joey pants and we just made some fucking crazy deal to have.

1828
01:40:16.730 --> 01:40:20.610
All right.
I want to work,
but I want everything to be cool.
Everything I do,

1829
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:23.700
it's gotta be fun.
No,
no,
no jobs.
It's suck.

1830
01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:28.200
It's impossible for everybody to do that though.
That's a real problem.

1831
01:40:28.201 --> 01:40:33.090
You can't have a society based on everybody doing awesome shit.
Unless what?

1832
01:40:33.091 --> 01:40:35.910
Everybody's awesome shit varies,
right?
Like some people,

1833
01:40:35.911 --> 01:40:40.050
it's gotta be awesome to work at in and out Burger,
you know what I mean?

1834
01:40:40.770 --> 01:40:41.551
Or No,
right.

1835
01:40:41.551 --> 01:40:46.200
Because that's like part of the process of becoming whoever the fuck you want to

1836
01:40:46.201 --> 01:40:48.690
become.
You have to go through some shit,
menial jobs.

1837
01:40:48.691 --> 01:40:52.600
Cut An understand what Labor's really like or find it or find out what you want

1838
01:40:52.601 --> 01:40:55.720
to do.
I think that that's more of it.
Like I grew up most of my life,

1839
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:59.290
like what do I want to do?
Really like I like to draw.
That's all I like to,

1840
01:40:59.770 --> 01:41:01.780
that's all I can say.
You know,

1841
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:05.290
I have to thank a fucking high school art teacher for being a Douche bag.

1842
01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.210
Cause if it wasn't for him being a Douche bag,

1843
01:41:07.211 --> 01:41:10.570
I probably never would've became a fighter or a comic.
You know,

1844
01:41:10.571 --> 01:41:14.760
I wanted to be an artist but my,
my high school art teacher.
Imagine lamb.

1845
01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:17.950
Imagine rewinding your life and you live in your life as an artist.

1846
01:41:17.951 --> 01:41:21.070
You what if you were like bad ass crazy artists?

1847
01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:24.340
I would have enjoyed it just to look.
I think I would enjoy life period.

1848
01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:28.030
But I definitely would have,
I think one of the most important things for me,

1849
01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:32.470
for my body type,
my brain type is to find some exertion,

1850
01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:35.950
martial arts.
Something where physically exert myself.
Yoga,

1851
01:41:36.190 --> 01:41:40.210
something where I you I figure out something to center my body.

1852
01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:43.950
The only thing that I would ever worry about doing something like,
you know,
uh,

1853
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:47.390
being an artist is a,
you're,
you're sitting at a desk a lot of hours.
Sure.

1854
01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:52.270
All upside down.
No,
stop it.
I feel it when I write,

1855
01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:55.630
when I write for like a a couple of days in a row when I'm like working on some

1856
01:41:55.631 --> 01:41:56.560
shit.
You know,

1857
01:41:56.561 --> 01:41:59.440
I feel like after sitting in front of a computer for a long period of time,

1858
01:41:59.441 --> 01:42:00.580
I feel super uncomfortable.

1859
01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:05.410
My next starts fucking crack and I started moving and pop and shit just not

1860
01:42:05.411 --> 01:42:07.780
healthy.
You remember when we were coming back,

1861
01:42:07.781 --> 01:42:12.640
we were looking at these guys at a,
in La when you land,
you know there's the Tsa,

1862
01:42:12.641 --> 01:42:15.970
they have a Goddamn laboratory out where they're checking your food.

1863
01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:19.090
You know the,
the contrast between the way they are in Japan,

1864
01:42:19.091 --> 01:42:22.690
the way they are in America is really stark.
It's really obvious.

1865
01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:27.900
They had like microscopes and shit and beakers and for refrigerators and I mean

1866
01:42:28.421 --> 01:42:29.570
it was really nuts.
They were,

1867
01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:33.400
they were testing things and the pulling people's strawberries apart,

1868
01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:36.430
chopping them up and throwing them into some fucking blender,

1869
01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:38.710
pouring things on them.
I don't know if it was a blender,

1870
01:42:38.711 --> 01:42:41.500
I think it was like some kind of light that they were seeing how it reacts to

1871
01:42:41.501 --> 01:42:44.020
like a light to see if there's any growth on something or,
yeah,

1872
01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:47.440
there was a little of that,
there were babies for the solution on it too.

1873
01:42:47.441 --> 01:42:49.510
I don't know what the solution was,
but you know,

1874
01:42:49.511 --> 01:42:52.170
everybody's like super suspicious.
Like they're,
they,

1875
01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:56.280
they opened up every little piece of all these little people's luggage,
you know,

1876
01:42:56.290 --> 01:43:01.290
and it was always people for they look small or brownish sort of people that

1877
01:43:01.481 --> 01:43:04.000
looked like,
you know,
they came from somewhere like South America may be,

1878
01:43:04.001 --> 01:43:07.990
or Mexico or something like that,
or Miami or could be Miami,
Miami,

1879
01:43:07.991 --> 01:43:12.460
they're tall and Tan.
Then,
uh,
as compact.
These are like compact,

1880
01:43:12.461 --> 01:43:15.570
like hardworking people.
And they were checking their fruit.
You know,

1881
01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:17.350
they wanted to bring home some goddamn fruit,

1882
01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:18.760
but I don't think you're allowed to.
Yeah,

1883
01:43:18.761 --> 01:43:21.620
they were cutting the fruit up and looking at every single piece.

1884
01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:23.860
So we just so weird that we have fucking,

1885
01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:26.810
I mean it's important I guess because the rest of the world's kind of wacky and

1886
01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:29.530
there's a lot of spots that like we were talking about Africa early or,

1887
01:43:29.531 --> 01:43:33.340
and you know any part of the world.
It's in turmoil right now.
This is,
you know,

1888
01:43:33.341 --> 01:43:34.420
you gotta,
you gotta check,

1889
01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:37.480
make sure you're allowing good people to come over here.

1890
01:43:37.481 --> 01:43:40.270
You don't want a bunch of fucking nut bags come over here and ruin what we've

1891
01:43:40.271 --> 01:43:45.220
got,
which is pretty sweet.
But man,
what a stark contrast it is to Japan,

1892
01:43:45.490 --> 01:43:48.790
Japan.
They're so happy to see you.
Hello?
Hello.
You're like,
yeah,

1893
01:43:48.791 --> 01:43:52.570
I'm not a criminal.
You're right.
I'm just coming here to work.
Thank you.
Oh,

1894
01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:56.690
it's okay.
Yeah.
My papers are in order.
No,
I don't.
I don't have any fruit.

1895
01:43:56.691 --> 01:44:01.340
Come on man.
Have a good day.
Everybody's Super Nice.

1896
01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:05.810
What would you go move there and so Golar Dixon peace sign,
bro.

1897
01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:07.490
Fucking love it.

1898
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:12.490
I want to go back that flight smile member crew member tea milk or what did I

1899
01:44:13.401 --> 01:44:15.940
drink?
Oh yeah,
no,
no cheat.

1900
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:20.210
He grabs something that looked like Thai iced coffee.
Yeah,
tires.

1901
01:44:20.211 --> 01:44:22.580
Coffee's delicious.
Delicious.
It looked like that.

1902
01:44:22.581 --> 01:44:25.940
It looked like this is probably like a Chocolatey,
delicious sort of coffee.

1903
01:44:25.941 --> 01:44:28.360
Sweet.
No ass.
Yeah.

1904
01:44:28.770 --> 01:44:33.610
When I say it tastes like straight up mulchers leaves.
Oh,

1905
01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:38.210
a hundred percent leave.
Remember window.

1906
01:44:38.211 --> 01:44:42.440
We went and got Sushi.
We had like the freshest,
most radioactive Sushi.

1907
01:44:43.610 --> 01:44:46.090
It was delicious.
At first we were like all scare,
like great,

1908
01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:49.520
don't eat fruits and vegetables.
All right.
Yeah,
let's not do that.
I was like,

1909
01:44:49.521 --> 01:44:51.920
listen man,
I'm just eating whatever the fuck I eat.

1910
01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:55.220
I take some potassium iodine and I'll be good.

1911
01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:58.730
He showed us also day or drivers showed us that Tokyo Tower is crooked at the

1912
01:44:58.731 --> 01:45:01.160
very top.
It was crooked from the,
well,

1913
01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:04.310
there's wires to support it because the earth earthquake you started falling

1914
01:45:04.311 --> 01:45:08.630
over so they had a support it with wires.
So yeah,
it's pretty fucking crazy.

1915
01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:12.260
The earthquake move,
that thing know they have a lot of earthquakes there.

1916
01:45:12.261 --> 01:45:15.230
That is something that they have to deal with and Tokyo and Mount Fiji.

1917
01:45:15.550 --> 01:45:17.360
Bryan count told me may or may not patrol,

1918
01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:20.420
but Brian Cowen told me and totally makes sense that the reason why they had,

1919
01:45:20.421 --> 01:45:23.600
they used to have paper houses there is because they have so many months hoons

1920
01:45:23.601 --> 01:45:24.220
and typhoons.

1921
01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:27.110
He didn't want your fucking house falling on you and killing you in the middle

1922
01:45:27.110 --> 01:45:30.140
of the night because they had no accurate way of predicting the weather.

1923
01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:33.500
So what they would do is they would just create very light houses.

1924
01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:35.600
So if you get hit in the head with some Balsa Wood and paper,

1925
01:45:35.601 --> 01:45:39.140
you're going to live and that wakes you up,
you know,
and then you're like,
oh,

1926
01:45:39.141 --> 01:45:40.910
I gotta get Outta here.
And then you,
you know,

1927
01:45:40.911 --> 01:45:43.250
go to an underground location or some shit is that way.

1928
01:45:43.251 --> 01:45:44.960
Japanese girls like have sex.
Like,

1929
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:49.620
because you didn't know how they have to find these curls,
have some porno.

1930
01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:53.090
But because,
because the walls are so thin,

1931
01:45:53.091 --> 01:45:55.910
they had to sound like chipmunks or something outside because you would hear

1932
01:45:55.911 --> 01:45:56.780
people have sex.

1933
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:59.720
I was in my hotel room and I was flipping through the channels and it was really

1934
01:45:59.721 --> 01:46:02.300
interesting because it was all Japanese television and,

1935
01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:06.710
but there was English menus and one of the,
one of the menu items said pay.

1936
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:08.840
So I said,
all right,

1937
01:46:08.841 --> 01:46:12.980
well this either how to pay my hotel bill or it's movies.

1938
01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:18.020
And so I click on pay and it immediately opens up with a dude with an Anana

1939
01:46:18.021 --> 01:46:23.021
anonymous mask banging a check and everything below the hips is blurry.

1940
01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:27.560
Like you can't see her,
her pussy,
you can't see his deck.

1941
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:32.510
There's this a mass of blurriness there.
And he's just like,
he's like hitting it,

1942
01:46:32.511 --> 01:46:35.580
but he's,
he's not hitting it.
Like he's got a big deck.
He sit and eat,

1943
01:46:35.581 --> 01:46:38.330
like he's got a little Dick.
So he's hitting it hard,

1944
01:46:38.450 --> 01:46:42.710
but the strokes are super small.
But he was just like this and he had a mask on.

1945
01:46:42.711 --> 01:46:47.030
So he's this mask on and he's like,
that's pay.
And that was on my bill.

1946
01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:50.340
I saw that was on my bill pay pay movie.
Yeah,

1947
01:46:50.850 --> 01:46:52.480
<v 4>I paid for that.
I didn't know what it was.
I,</v>

1948
01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:54.450
that's how I would get a menu when I went,

1949
01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:57.420
when I go through the menu and it says,
you know,
here's your options.
This,
this,

1950
01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:01.980
maybe there's some good movies you have to pay for.
So I clicked.

1951
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:06.020
It doesn't say adults that just says,
hey.
Yeah,
so,
uh,

1952
01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:08.030
I wound up watching this guy with an anonymous,

1953
01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:11.800
I only watch it for a few seconds for it come all over herself.

1954
01:47:11.850 --> 01:47:14.940
That's a screaming like a fucking Apache on a warpath.

1955
01:47:18.110 --> 01:47:19.260
I watched it.

1956
01:47:19.261 --> 01:47:23.550
I'd set the TV at an angle and I set up a day on and I just beat off and hit the

1957
01:47:23.551 --> 01:47:27.450
ceiling.
No,
I only watch it for,
I wasn't looking for,

1958
01:47:27.451 --> 01:47:31.740
I get that on the Internet.
Well,
I want to wash their strap to fit so crappy.

1959
01:47:32.010 --> 01:47:33.270
It was terrible.
They couldn't,
you couldn't,

1960
01:47:33.271 --> 01:47:35.520
you're not allowed to look at pussies.
It's like somehow or another,
they,

1961
01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:38.310
somebody tricked them into thinking that the thing that you want to look at is

1962
01:47:38.311 --> 01:47:41.520
bad,
but you can know what they're doing.
But it all has to be all blurry down.

1963
01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:42.720
They're like,
wait a minute.

1964
01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:46.290
Pixelation was pixelation the green light for pornography.

1965
01:47:46.291 --> 01:47:49.800
Didn't they have pornography before pixilation was available?
What did they do?

1966
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:51.690
Did they just never focused on the pussy?

1967
01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:55.020
Did one girl not like the way her pussy looked and she talks him fucking emperor

1968
01:47:55.021 --> 01:47:57.720
and to making it so it's a law.
You can't see a girl's pussy.

1969
01:47:57.780 --> 01:47:59.400
I think it's just disrespectful.
Is it?

1970
01:47:59.401 --> 01:48:02.970
Or is it dudes that are really ashamed of their tiny little decks and so they

1971
01:48:02.971 --> 01:48:07.190
just want it all blurred out.
It could be my jack had,
could be gin.

1972
01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:11.030
You know what I did watch this weekend?
It was pretty giant.
The,
Oh,

1973
01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:14.010
I saw the Kim Kardashians sex tape.
Somebody put it up on the message board.

1974
01:48:14.050 --> 01:48:17.400
I'd actually never seen it before.
It's great.
I never watched it.
Pretty powerful.

1975
01:48:17.570 --> 01:48:20.430
Well,
what's powerful is the size.
That guy's cock.
Holy Shit.

1976
01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:21.900
Cause she really got fucked in it.

1977
01:48:21.901 --> 01:48:24.920
That's what I like about that young man has a goddamn weapon.
Yeah,

1978
01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:27.780
he's got a big duck,
but she wasn't doing such a good job of sucking it.

1979
01:48:27.930 --> 01:48:31.560
She's mostly hands,
trickery,
supposedly trickery.

1980
01:48:32.190 --> 01:48:35.940
Why do you like blow job videos?
Why do you care what anybody likes?
You weirdo.

1981
01:48:35.941 --> 01:48:38.590
You get upset if somebody likes something that you don't like.

1982
01:48:41.150 --> 01:48:44.010
Blowjobs Oh,
do you understand?

1983
01:48:44.770 --> 01:48:47.010
Do you understand that for most men,

1984
01:48:47.011 --> 01:48:51.800
blow jobs are like the epitome of pleasure.
I never blow job.
They liked it.

1985
01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:55.410
Why is that?
Why is that weird?
Why 70% cockies you're like,

1986
01:48:55.411 --> 01:48:57.240
why is that weird when you're watching guys,
fuck.

1987
01:48:57.300 --> 01:48:59.010
Do you only like concentrate on the woman?

1988
01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:03.450
Like I like seeing the girl definitely get fucked.
But like with a blowjob video,

1989
01:49:03.451 --> 01:49:07.850
it's all about this like looking around it and cleaning it and it's not really

1990
01:49:07.870 --> 01:49:09.570
all about pretending it's your dick stupid.

1991
01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:11.790
You got a shitty way of looking at it either way.

1992
01:49:11.791 --> 01:49:15.690
That's not you fucking that girl either.
Do you see him whimpering?
No,

1993
01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:19.860
that's not you.
Do you see him?
Just three strokes and out of breath.

1994
01:49:19.890 --> 01:49:20.880
And that's how you,
you know,

1995
01:49:20.881 --> 01:49:23.940
there's nothing like watching a guy have a girl fingers Bible.

1996
01:49:24.730 --> 01:49:25.920
Why watch guys fuck it all.

1997
01:49:26.010 --> 01:49:29.390
Why not just all watch only lesbian porno and so managed.

1998
01:49:29.391 --> 01:49:34.391
If Dad was waiting for me on a planet somewhere and I was the only man and they

1999
01:49:34.591 --> 01:49:38.520
would all be mine,
they would fight over me while she's using the plastic.

2000
01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:43.200
Just waiting,
waiting for you to land on your little raft.

2001
01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:47.990
Isn't that like a,
what is

2002
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:50.100
<v 1>that?
What you got there?
You got to a desk.</v>

2003
01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:54.190
They look it's brass knuckles on one side and then a dildo on the other one.

2004
01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:57.940
What is the brass knuckles are made out of plastic,
Huh?
Yeah.

2005
01:49:57.941 --> 01:49:59.350
So there's two different types of plastic.

2006
01:49:59.351 --> 01:50:03.750
There's a softer plastic that goes into a box.
Hard accident.
Is it bad?
It's not.

2007
01:50:03.751 --> 01:50:06.650
It's hard rubber.
But then you,
you like just fuck her placing.

2008
01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:09.070
Where did you get this?
I bought it,

2009
01:50:09.370 --> 01:50:12.880
but where I'm not just saying in Japan.
No.

2010
01:50:14.590 --> 01:50:18.480
So,
um,
you,
you've got to use that on a Rodin.
No,

2011
01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:21.700
you have two girls do it for you.
Oh,
and you stick it up your ass.

2012
01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:23.940
Is that what you're saying?
I know you just,
you want to soccer.

2013
01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:25.630
What do you want to do now?
You just,
you know,

2014
01:50:25.631 --> 01:50:28.570
slap in the face with you want to get slapped while you're doing it.
Oh,
okay.

2015
01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:29.793
So you,

2016
01:50:30.010 --> 01:50:32.440
you slapped him in the face where your Dick while you pretend you're fucking

2017
01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:36.190
with a giant bark fucking each other with that.
Oh,
okay.
That seems silly.

2018
01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:38.470
It seems like you're missing the point of sex.

2019
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:42.070
You let letting some big rubber dick take over your turf.

2020
01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:44.920
The Rubber Dick is getting late and you're just slapping girls' in the face with

2021
01:50:44.921 --> 01:50:48.280
your cock.
That's ridiculous.
The best thing is to get laid,
Brian.

2022
01:50:48.281 --> 01:50:50.710
And you've given that to a plastic deck you've like,
yeah,

2023
01:50:50.711 --> 01:50:52.420
well I know that it can never be as good as that.

2024
01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:56.980
So just let her use the fake Dick and I'll just get my pleasure off on her face.

2025
01:50:57.630 --> 01:50:58.840
Is that what it is now?

2026
01:51:00.010 --> 01:51:04.120
I just get them all worked up until they need a real dick.
Oh really?

2027
01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:05.530
So what's this all about?

2028
01:51:05.531 --> 01:51:09.910
Foreplay that giant fake Dick just gets them worked up thinking about,
man,

2029
01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:13.290
there's a diff out there.
There's this big as this.
I need to find that dig.

2030
01:51:13.291 --> 01:51:15.430
It becomes like Indiana Jones.
And the last Dick,

2031
01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:20.770
when a women find out that it's possible that that giant Dildo could be on a
man,

2032
01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:25.150
she's like,
maybe I could love him.
Maybe it's like my dream,
man.

2033
01:51:25.151 --> 01:51:28.570
I don't even know.
I'm just wasting my time with this average Dick Loser.

2034
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:32.830
<v 3>It makes it easier for them to have a baby and they appreciate you fucking them</v>

2035
01:51:32.831 --> 01:51:34.720
with that and stretching it out for them.

2036
01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:37.650
<v 1>Hmm.
I don't think so.
I don't think any girl looks at it like that.</v>

2037
01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:41.440
I think she wishes it was a real dick.
That's what she thinks she wishes.

2038
01:51:41.490 --> 01:51:42.330
God dammit.

2039
01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:46.800
It's probably some genetic thing inside their body that must feel so much better

2040
01:51:46.801 --> 01:51:48.780
when the JIC his dick is just gigantic.

2041
01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:52.410
That's why people have to say shit like size doesn't matter.
That's ridiculous.

2042
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:56.340
Of course it matters.
How could you say that?
It's so foolish?
I think foolish,

2043
01:51:56.430 --> 01:51:59.850
foolish to say,
well,
it's something that creates more frictions.
Larger,

2044
01:52:00.030 --> 01:52:00.870
it wouldn't be better.

2045
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.940
<v 3>Well,
I,
I do say that there is something to a certain point,</v>

2046
01:52:03.941 --> 01:52:08.941
I don't think there's much of a difference if it's fat and to a certain point,

2047
01:52:08.951 --> 01:52:13.450
I think it hits a certain spot.
Even if it's larger.
It doesn't need to be larger,

2048
01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:16.630
especially the girl in the butter.
Some girls do.
You're crazy.

2049
01:52:16.750 --> 01:52:20.440
I think I'm sure that's not even an option.
I mean like,
like if it's like,

2050
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:21.131
like hey,

2051
01:52:21.131 --> 01:52:25.480
do you want eight inches or do you want 14 I think they would rather say eight

2052
01:52:25.481 --> 01:52:26.770
inches.
Yeah.
That's a good point.

2053
01:52:26.771 --> 01:52:30.670
That there's a certain point where it starts hurting.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

2054
01:52:30.671 --> 01:52:33.190
There's some girls that don't enjoy having sex with guys cause they're just

2055
01:52:33.191 --> 01:52:35.470
slamming into their cervix.
Yeah.
So the end,

2056
01:52:35.471 --> 01:52:38.830
they were like trying to stretch out their fucking,
their drama at the end ball,

2057
01:52:38.831 --> 01:52:41.350
the meat drum at the end of slamming into it.

2058
01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:44.260
That's why you have cock rings and you know that's like washers for the girls.

2059
01:52:44.261 --> 01:52:46.310
Assholes so stops you at a certain point,

2060
01:52:46.311 --> 01:52:49.700
like a doorstop so you won't hurt their per girl.
Your lover.

2061
01:52:49.701 --> 01:52:52.250
You've got to find how many rings you need.
Good move.

2062
01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:55.640
<v 2>Cock ring stoppers.
Yeah,
washers,</v>

2063
01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:58.220
washers live on that part of your deck would always be sad.

2064
01:52:58.730 --> 01:53:01.370
That party of Dick would always be sad like what about us?

2065
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:02.780
What squirts do you still in there?

2066
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:06.520
The whole Dick wants in on the action and the PR.

2067
01:53:06.590 --> 01:53:10.190
Apparently the deepest part of your Dick is oftentimes the most sensitive,

2068
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:13.490
which is why it's camped out next to your balls.
It's like super sensitive,

2069
01:53:13.491 --> 01:53:14.324
just like your balls.

2070
01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:18.010
That's why it feels so good to go all the way in there and what it is is is

2071
01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:21.080
mother nature trying to set you up so that you definitely have kids,

2072
01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:25.670
Mother Nature trying to pitch the sperm as close to the eggs as possible.

2073
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:30.260
Knowing that these Rambo spermatozoa does have a five day lifespan.

2074
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:34.280
If they're the like the best navy seal type hold their breath sperm ever.

2075
01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:38.050
<v 3>That's crazy.
About five days because sometimes I'd be like,
all right baby,</v>

2076
01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:41.200
since you're on your period,
I'm going to come in you,
you know,

2077
01:53:41.201 --> 01:53:44.060
and then you're like,
wait,
she in five days she might be offered period.

2078
01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:45.510
There might still be commonary.
She hasn't.

2079
01:53:48.450 --> 01:53:49.870
<v 2>Yeah.
That's why the the rhythm method,</v>

2080
01:53:49.871 --> 01:53:53.220
it's very tricky and shooting the load inside of chick cause you're pretty sure

2081
01:53:53.221 --> 01:53:55.780
she's not ambulating.
Ooh,
that's tricky son.

2082
01:53:56.190 --> 01:53:59.970
That's why Irish people have so many kids.
It's a lot of it.
The rhythm method,

2083
01:54:00.030 --> 01:54:03.450
those are the,
for Real Irish Catholic,
you know,
Catholics,

2084
01:54:03.451 --> 01:54:06.450
Catholics aren't supposed to use birth control.
Birth control is not good,

2085
01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:08.760
<v 0>Huh?</v>

2086
01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:10.800
<v 2>Yeah.
Isn't that funny?
It's hilarious.
I mean,</v>

2087
01:54:10.801 --> 01:54:14.940
think about all these overpopulated places in Latin America,
Mexico,
Catholics,

2088
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:16.800
you know,
and they don't want to use birth control.

2089
01:54:17.730 --> 01:54:18.300
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2090
01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:19.230
<v 2>It's pretty ridiculous.</v>

2091
01:54:19.231 --> 01:54:23.760
That's a bunch of hate or bullshit stop and guy from using a condom.
How dare you

2092
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:27.130
<v 3>like it.
Like if you come on something and then it girl sits on it,</v>

2093
01:54:27.550 --> 01:54:29.890
are you responsible for that child?
It's a good question.

2094
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:30.833
<v 2>A bet you are.</v>

2095
01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:34.240
I bet if you came on a table and she scooped it up and stuffed in there snatch,

2096
01:54:34.270 --> 01:54:37.930
I bet she could probably say,
you know,
hey,
you know,
this is what he wanted.

2097
01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:40.840
This fantasy was for me to get pregnant by stealing his berm.

2098
01:54:41.730 --> 01:54:45.120
<v 3>That seems as crazy that you have to have responsibility for liquid.
Well,</v>

2099
01:54:45.121 --> 01:54:48.330
it's crazy that you have to have responsibility for a chemical process that

2100
01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:50.880
results in our life.
When if you,

2101
01:54:50.881 --> 01:54:54.690
if someone stole your sperm or if he just like,
you know,

2102
01:54:54.691 --> 01:54:58.980
like comed on a bed and then you had a friend over and she took off her clothes.

2103
01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:02.670
It wasn't your intention to get a girl pregnant.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2104
01:55:02.671 --> 01:55:03.660
You shouldn't be responsible,

2105
01:55:03.661 --> 01:55:07.340
but then you would have to have like a transcript so that night to approve or

2106
01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:11.600
you didn't actually just come inside of her and just go,
oh in the,
yeah,

2107
01:55:11.630 --> 01:55:13.080
that should be proved either way.

2108
01:55:13.410 --> 01:55:17.310
You know meaning like if you're going to say that you had sex,

2109
01:55:17.311 --> 01:55:18.570
you have to have proof for that.
Awesome.

2110
01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:22.050
Instead of half time when people have sperming and once cause they had socks.

2111
01:55:22.051 --> 01:55:22.741
Pride.
Yeah.
I know.

2112
01:55:22.741 --> 01:55:25.290
It seems to be the thing that you shouldn't have to prove in court though.

2113
01:55:25.291 --> 01:55:27.080
You think or you would have to prove it either way.

2114
01:55:28.050 --> 01:55:30.720
That's doesn't seem fair to the girl.
How's she gonna prove that?

2115
01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:33.210
Then girls would just start to setting up cameras.
Hidden cameras.

2116
01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:37.140
Guys prove that.
She just sat on your comment where it was on her bed.

2117
01:55:37.650 --> 01:55:38.760
<v 2>Well,
you'd have to have a video.</v>

2118
01:55:38.761 --> 01:55:41.580
You ejaculate on the bed and then like some hidden camera.

2119
01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:44.160
<v 3>We should have be able to us having sex then</v>

2120
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:46.710
<v 2>for the same reason.
Well,
imagine if it comes down to that.</v>

2121
01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:49.020
Imagine comes down to every time you have sex you have to record it.

2122
01:55:49.021 --> 01:55:51.270
Just so everybody knows that no rape crimes took place.

2123
01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:52.680
Nothing creepy took place.

2124
01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:56.280
So the government would have just like a massive database of people fucking just

2125
01:55:56.281 --> 01:55:58.560
make sure,
look,
we had some behind closed doors,

2126
01:55:58.561 --> 01:56:02.190
rapes going on and we had to stop them because of like 10 rapes in a city.

2127
01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:07.020
Everybody has to get their self film while they fuck no purposes.

2128
01:56:07.021 --> 01:56:07.854
You're allowed to view.

2129
01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:10.730
And could you imagine if you had one of those clips on that you were,
you know,

2130
01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:13.800
that fit clip thing that you were?
Imagine if it's like,
you know your,

2131
01:56:13.801 --> 01:56:16.620
your heartbeat gets jacked up like 160 beats per minute.
They're like,

2132
01:56:16.621 --> 01:56:19.620
okay Mr Ryko,
are you having sex or you at the gym?

2133
01:56:19.650 --> 01:56:22.800
Please respond like you gotta make sure you're not fucking dude.

2134
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:25.200
Cause if you're not fucking,
no one can watch.
How come,

2135
01:56:25.230 --> 01:56:26.370
how come you fucking in the dark?

2136
01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:29.280
You're supposed to be in front of the camera now,
sir.
You're fit clips has it.

2137
01:56:29.281 --> 01:56:32.670
Your heart rate is elevated.
That's funny.
Yeah.
Every,
all the fucking you do.

2138
01:56:32.671 --> 01:56:36.930
You can ever rape anybody in the closet.
No,
no,
no,
no.

2139
01:56:37.770 --> 01:56:39.150
That's,
that's gonna be the next thing.

2140
01:56:39.151 --> 01:56:41.910
There's going to be a way to monitor your state of consciousness,

2141
01:56:41.911 --> 01:56:45.120
your heart rate,
your,
your,
your blood sugar levels,
all that shit.

2142
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:49.770
You gotta be able monitor it constantly on a person's body.
Just makes sense.

2143
01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:51.030
Like some sort of an implant.

2144
01:56:51.150 --> 01:56:55.080
So the implant will just read the various variables in your body and then

2145
01:56:55.081 --> 01:56:57.420
interface with some sort of a computer.
You'll walk in front of,

2146
01:56:57.421 --> 01:57:00.120
somebody will scan it and it'll just read back the information.

2147
01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:03.360
You think about how small computers are now compared to how big they were when

2148
01:57:03.361 --> 01:57:05.280
NASA launched the Apollo missions.

2149
01:57:05.281 --> 01:57:07.170
And then think of how small they are going to be in the future.

2150
01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:08.370
They're going to be injectable,

2151
01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:11.220
going to have a computer that you can inject into your fucking ass.

2152
01:57:11.370 --> 01:57:14.690
Just a little,
like a hard,
like it would be like a tiny,

2153
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:18.540
tiny half size grain of rice,
half a grain of rice.

2154
01:57:18.570 --> 01:57:20.180
It's already been putting in your ass.
Yeah.

2155
01:57:20.190 --> 01:57:23.400
Doctors had been paid to give it to you.
That's what people think of.

2156
01:57:23.401 --> 01:57:26.640
Believe in aliens.
You know,
believes in aliens.
Edgar Mitchell,

2157
01:57:26.820 --> 01:57:28.890
former astronauts guy walked on the moon,

2158
01:57:29.650 --> 01:57:33.450
<v 7>so he believes in aliens whom some big fucking press conference.</v>

2159
01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:36.840
<v 2>I think there's not a press conference,
but an interview.</v>

2160
01:57:36.990 --> 01:57:39.810
He did an interview where he was saying that,
uh,
he,
um,

2161
01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:44.960
he knows that the government has access to information and that he can prove or

2162
01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:46.760
lease.

2163
01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:51.530
He believes to the best of his knowledge that the government is a received

2164
01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:54.360
transmissions from aliens.
Been in communication with them.

2165
01:57:54.361 --> 01:57:57.750
They know that they're watching us.
They know that they're hovering around earth.

2166
01:57:57.970 --> 01:58:01.470
It was kind of interesting watching this guy with his fucking dog is like his

2167
01:58:01.471 --> 01:58:04.470
dog sitting in his lap.
It's Kinda cute.
Here's a little terrier,

2168
01:58:04.471 --> 01:58:05.460
and he's talking about,

2169
01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:11.090
it's talking about Ufo woes and all these different things that the government

2170
01:58:11.091 --> 01:58:13.220
knows exists and you're like,
whoa,

2171
01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:17.300
is this kind of lost his marbles or is he telling the truth?
And he's like,

2172
01:58:17.301 --> 01:58:20.930
I don't give a fuck anymore.
I got my dog here.
I'm 18 fucking years old.

2173
01:58:21.140 --> 01:58:23.840
I'm just going to tell people and no one's probably going to believe me,
but hey,

2174
01:58:23.841 --> 01:58:25.850
whatever.
You know when your thing,

2175
01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:31.350
<v 3>there was a really cool dog breeding at that's in Japan.</v>

2176
01:58:31.351 --> 01:58:35.700
I've been researching a lot now because it's,
you only really see it in Japan.

2177
01:58:35.850 --> 01:58:38.520
But I saw one on the street and it looks so weird.

2178
01:58:38.521 --> 01:58:43.090
It looks like a Fox mixed with the cat and it was a bred to hunt,

2179
01:58:43.150 --> 01:58:46.750
uh,
bears by the Japanese and it's a cold,

2180
01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:51.310
I think it's called Sheebu.
He move or something like that.

2181
01:58:51.311 --> 01:58:52.330
She will hold on,

2182
01:58:52.740 --> 01:58:56.520
<v 2>you know,
that's my,
one of my dogs.
My dogs is half sheet.
Yeah,</v>

2183
01:58:56.730 --> 01:59:00.190
he's got a little bit of content him.
He's a nice,
he's a sweet ed,
but he's,
he's,

2184
01:59:00.191 --> 01:59:03.240
he's confused.
He's a sweetheart.
But he's confused cause he's half bull dog.

2185
01:59:03.241 --> 01:59:05.580
Half she will,
you know,
so he doesn't know what the hell he is.

2186
01:59:05.670 --> 01:59:09.090
He doesn't know whether to be lazy or whether it be like a little cunty.
Yeah,

2187
01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:12.330
he's a sweetheart though.
Like he's really like really nice.

2188
01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:14.100
Like it's as far as like when you come out to him,

2189
01:59:14.101 --> 01:59:18.210
he always wants to be pat is that he's a nice dog but he gets a little snappy

2190
01:59:18.211 --> 01:59:19.010
with people.

2191
01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:19.221
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2192
01:59:19.221 --> 01:59:22.820
I guess that the breed is kind of like very protective of just the family but

2193
01:59:22.821 --> 01:59:26.640
also like,
you know,
they're just like,
he like complete assholes but it's,

2194
01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:28.760
we're really weird facial expressions.

2195
01:59:28.761 --> 01:59:31.760
Like this chick that was walking the dog in Japan,

2196
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:35.060
she was like about to turn this corner and the dog wouldn't go.

2197
01:59:35.061 --> 01:59:37.340
Just stopped and looked at her at this face like,
hey,

2198
01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:40.910
I need to go take a shit over there.
And immediately he,
she was like,

2199
01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:42.560
oh I'm sorry.
And she said sorry.

2200
01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:46.550
And then we like went to the grass and he took a ship.
But it was weird.
The face.

2201
01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:47.800
Well animated

2202
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:52.900
<v 2>dogs or the dogs that are a,
usually the smartest,
you know the,
the,</v>

2203
01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:55.550
the smartest dogs.
The dogs go,
hey,
hey,
hey,
you got a problem here.

2204
01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:57.950
You know like German shepherds and Shit,
wolves,

2205
01:59:58.190 --> 02:00:00.290
those dogs does it smart as fuck man.

2206
02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:03.200
And they're the ones that a lot of times cause problems.
They escape a lot,

2207
02:00:03.230 --> 02:00:04.700
you know,
cause they get bored.

2208
02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:08.910
<v 3>What's that Brita dog at my friend Pete has this dog,</v>

2209
02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:13.170
that one word that there's a thing down its back that grows the opposite

2210
02:00:13.171 --> 02:00:15.400
direction.
The hair grows.
The yeah.

2211
02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:20.160
Is a ridgeback and manage things intimidating to be around as it really has a

2212
02:00:20.161 --> 02:00:24.840
solid dog.
Like I'm more scared of that dog than I am pimple.
Wow.
That's crazy.

2213
02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:29.150
I don't know.
Just some,
some around it.
Like it looks like it's,
it could,
it,

2214
02:00:29.210 --> 02:00:31.830
it looks like a,
check your email real quick.

2215
02:00:31.831 --> 02:00:35.220
I sent you that Edgar Mitchell video.
Oh there they're more of a slender dog man.

2216
02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:37.770
Yeah.
But addition,
written backs,
all muscle.
They're very,

2217
02:00:37.771 --> 02:00:40.410
very athletic guard dog style.

2218
02:00:41.370 --> 02:00:43.100
The scariest dogs are the big ones.
Those,

2219
02:00:43.140 --> 02:00:47.730
those are the ones that can tell you it's huge.
You know,
it's,
it's a hunt lions,

2220
02:00:48.130 --> 02:00:52.680
they're decent bridge back shot up.
Like this thing's humongous.
Let's look up,

2221
02:00:52.681 --> 02:00:54.900
cause I'm pretty sure they only get to be about 80 or 90 pounds.

2222
02:00:54.901 --> 02:00:58.410
Just things stood was taller than me standing up.
It was like Marma Duke,

2223
02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:02.820
our muscles a muscular Marmaduke.
That's what it reminded me of.

2224
02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:09.120
Like a dog that would be in the video.
Can Russian attack?
Really?
Yeah.
That big.

2225
02:01:09.150 --> 02:01:10.290
No Dude,
they're kind of a slender

2226
02:01:10.290 --> 02:01:11.640
<v 2>dog.
I'm looking at him right now,
man.</v>

2227
02:01:12.090 --> 02:01:14.040
I think you're confusing this with somebody.
I think we're,

2228
02:01:14.041 --> 02:01:15.810
we're communicating about different dogs.

2229
02:01:15.890 --> 02:01:17.000
<v 3>This is the one that has a,</v>

2230
02:01:17.001 --> 02:01:20.780
a line that goes down at back that goes a different direction.
It ridgeback.

2231
02:01:20.850 --> 02:01:22.080
<v 2>Yeah.
Well there's,</v>

2232
02:01:22.081 --> 02:01:24.930
I guess there's one that's in here that looks kind of muscular,

2233
02:01:25.110 --> 02:01:26.580
but they seem very thin.

2234
02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:28.363
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2235
02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:30.440
<v 2>Um,
so I'm trying to figure out how big they get.</v>

2236
02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:38.400
<v 3>Uh,
does it appearance?
Here we go.
Oh,
they call him the lion hunter.</v>

2237
02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:40.010
70 pounds,
bro.

2238
02:01:41.410 --> 02:01:42.243
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2239
02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:44.500
<v 1>Oh,
okay.
No,
no,
no way.</v>

2240
02:01:44.501 --> 02:01:47.320
About 80 males weigh about 85 pounds.

2241
02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:48.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2242
02:01:48.930 --> 02:01:52.320
<v 1>She'll be 2,102 to too many or much larger.</v>

2243
02:01:52.810 --> 02:01:55.200
Which backs are typical muscular.
Okay.

2244
02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:59.430
So I guess even though some of them are like 85 pounds,

2245
02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:01.530
they're saying some of them get way bigger.
Check this out.

2246
02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:03.600
So I would imagine if you ran into a hundred pounder,
yeah,

2247
02:02:03.601 --> 02:02:07.730
that'd be a big fucking dog.
Check this out.
That's a Rhodesian Brewster,

2248
02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:08.610
amazing dogs

2249
02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:09.840
<v 8>to walk the face of the earth.</v>

2250
02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:14.460
Also known as the African Lion Dog.

2251
02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:19.530
The Rhodesian ridgeback is a large muscular dog bred in southern Africa to hunt

2252
02:02:19.531 --> 02:02:24.000
lions.
Whoa.
You know that term keeping a line at bay?
Well,

2253
02:02:24.001 --> 02:02:26.280
that came from the Rhodesian ridgebacks.

2254
02:02:27.150 --> 02:02:32.150
The breed was created by hot and tots and indigenous people of South Africa and

2255
02:02:32.370 --> 02:02:34.200
early German and Dutch settlers.

2256
02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:38.850
They combined imported mastiffs great Danes,
greyhounds,

2257
02:02:38.970 --> 02:02:42.840
bloodhounds terriers and other breeds,
the heart and top dog,

2258
02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:48.140
a semi wild tribal guarding and hunting dog to create the Rhodesian ridgeback.

2259
02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:53.780
Imagine the type of personality it takes to run after a seven 800 pound cat and,

2260
02:02:55.201 --> 02:02:58.110
and chase it up a tree.
And that's the Rhodesian ridgeback.

2261
02:02:58.260 --> 02:03:02.550
The most unique and defining characteristics of the Rhodesian ridgeback is,

2262
02:03:02.551 --> 02:03:06.870
is rich.
He can thank the wild hot and Todd dog for that.

2263
02:03:07.710 --> 02:03:11.340
It's basically hair going in the opposite direction of the hair that grows down

2264
02:03:11.341 --> 02:03:14.640
the rest of their body.
The Ridge should be clearly defined.

2265
02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:17.700
It's like an empire dogs back.

2266
02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:19.740
Do you remember where we ran into that girl

2267
02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:22.570
<v 1>who works with the UFC who has a dog like my dog?</v>

2268
02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:27.330
Only 50 fucking pounds bigger.
Yeah,
that 200 pound.
Massive.

2269
02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:29.410
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

2270
02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:34.300
That dog was so ridiculous and really sweet and were there.
They're really sweet,

2271
02:03:34.301 --> 02:03:36.310
gentle dogs,
but like when I like touch,

2272
02:03:36.311 --> 02:03:38.710
the dog just wanted me to take a picture with him.
I put my arm around him,

2273
02:03:38.711 --> 02:03:41.910
I was like next to him and he would like move a little like bump into me and I'd

2274
02:03:41.911 --> 02:03:46.000
be like,
oh Jesus.
Like you're standing,
you're standing next to a giant animal.

2275
02:03:46.001 --> 02:03:47.140
It's really big.

2276
02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:51.700
It's bigger than me and it's a dog and it's these enormous fucking head on him.

2277
02:03:51.970 --> 02:03:56.320
Oh my God.
That thing was ridiculous.
200 pounds and she flies.

2278
02:03:56.321 --> 02:03:58.300
It goes in a plane.
Wow.

2279
02:03:58.310 --> 02:04:01.630
Isn't the cargo holds somehow or another with this giant box?
It stays it.

2280
02:04:01.650 --> 02:04:05.020
That's so rude to fly with animals.
I think dog didn't seem to give a fuck.

2281
02:04:05.470 --> 02:04:07.480
I think she did it so often.
He was just used to it.

2282
02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:10.930
Have you ever been around somebody that their ears pop during a flight?
Yeah.

2283
02:04:11.170 --> 02:04:12.100
That's so great.
Well,

2284
02:04:12.101 --> 02:04:15.370
you know what else else happens if you have any sort of a sinus infection,

2285
02:04:15.610 --> 02:04:18.880
it's unbelievably painful in your ears when you get to high altitude,

2286
02:04:19.330 --> 02:04:21.970
when you coming down and when you're coming down somehow or another,

2287
02:04:21.971 --> 02:04:25.990
that's when your ears start popping and it's excruciating fucking pain.

2288
02:04:27.330 --> 02:04:30.840
Sinus pain that that deep ear sinus pain when you're all,

2289
02:04:30.850 --> 02:04:35.530
your whole inside is clogged and affected.
Ooh,
that's not good on a plane.

2290
02:04:36.700 --> 02:04:37.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2291
02:04:37.410 --> 02:04:38.970
<v 1>Planes are fucking freaky dude.</v>

2292
02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:42.210
What's going to be next though is they're going to be like the ever going to be

2293
02:04:42.211 --> 02:04:43.110
a Concord again.

2294
02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:46.890
They're ever going to go with supersonic travel or is it just too dangerous?

2295
02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:49.140
I don't know.
I just don't like flying over the ocean.

2296
02:04:49.330 --> 02:04:52.020
And when you go that fast in birds even get out of your way,

2297
02:04:52.050 --> 02:04:55.080
do they even have time to get out of your way?
Yeah.
So if you slam it a birds,

2298
02:04:55.081 --> 02:04:56.840
is that a wrap?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2299
02:04:57.420 --> 02:05:01.740
If you like taking off off the fucking lax and you're in a Concorde and you're

2300
02:05:01.741 --> 02:05:06.060
launching through the fucking air,
you hit like supersonic speeds.
Berg.

2301
02:05:06.190 --> 02:05:08.300
That pursuit dad is fuck right.
Yup.

2302
02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:10.680
And you'd probably have to take off really fast with those things too.

2303
02:05:10.681 --> 02:05:12.810
It's not like you have the option to take off slow.
Right.

2304
02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:17.140
The wants the coast is clear.
Then you rock it,
dude.
No,

2305
02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:20.220
I think you have to take off fast at the beginning.
That's amazing though.

2306
02:05:20.221 --> 02:05:22.230
Have you ever watched him in the footage of the Concorde?
Yeah,

2307
02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:23.460
they were washed it.
Yeah.

2308
02:05:23.670 --> 02:05:26.400
It's incredible to pull up the video of the Concord so we could see what it

2309
02:05:26.401 --> 02:05:30.540
looks like.
Not a Concorde exploding though.
That's shit's depressing.
Oh,

2310
02:05:31.290 --> 02:05:34.770
that's what happened.
A bunch of them exploded.
Why?
Well,

2311
02:05:34.771 --> 02:05:39.240
one of them hit a tire than another.
A plane had left behind on the runway,

2312
02:05:39.241 --> 02:05:43.770
so as it was accelerating it hit a tire and the tire kicked up and slammed into

2313
02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:49.020
the plane and cause it to be on fire as they were in the air.

2314
02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:52.700
Look at that fucking thing,
man.
That's what a lot of people thought.

2315
02:05:52.701 --> 02:05:57.680
I think they came out in the 80s is that correct?
I think so,
yeah.
Let me see.

2316
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:58.970
I'm pretty sure.
I'm sorry.

2317
02:06:03.150 --> 02:06:03.983
<v 0>I don't</v>

2318
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:09.980
<v 1>Concord's creep was they did them for a little while and then it got to a point</v>

2319
02:06:09.981 --> 02:06:14.750
where you know too many people there were malfunctioning to march over the last

2320
02:06:14.751 --> 02:06:17.240
one.
I think it was really expensive to do in the last one.

2321
02:06:17.241 --> 02:06:21.890
Killed a lot of rich mother fuckers.
They did it for 27 years.

2322
02:06:21.891 --> 02:06:24.890
Wow,
that's amazing.
Yeah,

2323
02:06:24.891 --> 02:06:28.220
so at first flight was in 1969 that's amazing.

2324
02:06:28.460 --> 02:06:32.810
They were going supersonic speeds and 69 that is a credible,

2325
02:06:35.050 --> 02:06:36.160
is it?
Here's where it goes.

2326
02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:42.090
<v 9>It's on the runway right now.
It looks so bad ass too.</v>

2327
02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:45.150
Apparently they're loud as fuck too,
and they take off.

2328
02:06:48.090 --> 02:06:50.970
Right now it's just rolling.
Built up speed.

2329
02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:54.990
This looks totally like a regular plain right here.

2330
02:06:55.410 --> 02:06:56.243
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2331
02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:07.720
<v 9>isn't it the nose?
It's down.
It's pointed down.
So weird.</v>

2332
02:07:09.010 --> 02:07:11.350
I hope the side,
no,
it's up.
No,

2333
02:07:11.351 --> 02:07:14.740
it's not blowing up cause the other one blew up as it was in the air like wet

2334
02:07:14.741 --> 02:07:18.910
when it took off.
It's imagine if they hit that.

2335
02:07:19.180 --> 02:07:21.790
It looks so sick though.
Look at the shape of it.

2336
02:07:24.410 --> 02:07:29.150
God Damn.
I would've liked to fun and one of those Richard Branson.

2337
02:07:29.210 --> 02:07:32.780
<v 1>I know you're out there.
Figure out a way just to make a better one.
Yeah.</v>

2338
02:07:33.070 --> 02:07:36.250
See if you find one to actually take you off though.
That one was boring as fuck.

2339
02:07:36.850 --> 02:07:40.240
<v 2>I want to see a Concorde going fast.
See Concorde go fast.</v>

2340
02:07:41.590 --> 02:07:42.423
Go fast

2341
02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:46.113
<v 9>down.</v>

2342
02:07:48.390 --> 02:07:53.040
We don't see this brand very badly.
Oh Shit.

2343
02:07:53.310 --> 02:07:55.170
Bring that back to the beginning so everybody could see that.

2344
02:07:55.710 --> 02:07:57.950
Oh cheese indicator.

2345
02:07:59.130 --> 02:08:04.010
It takes off as it takes of it.
Hit something very badly.

2346
02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:05.940
Oh my God,
it's scary.

2347
02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:14.440
Oh,
speed indicator.
So fake.
That is

2348
02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:18.933
the ideal.

2349
02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:29.100
How can they,
when that's happened to me,

2350
02:08:29.101 --> 02:08:31.540
there's no way to stop at reception of a fellow marker.

2351
02:08:35.730 --> 02:08:39.060
Can you turn around?
There's so not mobile.

2352
02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:45.220
<v 4>The fuck are,
we don't know.</v>

2353
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:49.060
What's a weird sort of a reenactment someone's doing like post-fight.
Yeah.

2354
02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:51.950
<v 2>Commentary.
This one's 2 million.</v>

2355
02:08:53.570 --> 02:08:57.680
That's fucked up.
So apparently a lot of rich people died on that dude.
Cause the,

2356
02:08:57.880 --> 02:08:59.720
the tickets were stupid expensive,

2357
02:09:00.380 --> 02:09:02.780
but I guess he could get to Europe and like two hours.

2358
02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:07.710
<v 4>Wow.
That'd be weird.
I don't,
I don't mind flying when,
when,
when it like,</v>

2359
02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:11.020
it's nicer that the planes that go overseas seem to be a little bit bigger

2360
02:09:11.050 --> 02:09:14.410
because I couldn't imagine being like on a southwest flight or not a southwest

2361
02:09:14.411 --> 02:09:17.410
flight,
but one those Delta flight or whatever,
where it's like super tight.

2362
02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:20.170
There's 12 hours.
Planes are just rude.

2363
02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:23.200
There's sometimes when they pack people in there,
you're like,
this is just rude.

2364
02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:28.120
This is like human cattle.
Yeah.
Inhumane.
Slightly inhumane.
Yeah.

2365
02:09:28.121 --> 02:09:28.990
But I mean that's the,

2366
02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:32.910
<v 2>well people will be there.
They're willing to pay,
you know,</v>

2367
02:09:32.911 --> 02:09:34.080
to be transported.

2368
02:09:34.081 --> 02:09:35.850
They're willing to be uncomfortable as long as they don't have to pay a

2369
02:09:35.851 --> 02:09:38.220
ridiculous amount of money.
And when you think about it that way,

2370
02:09:38.221 --> 02:09:39.510
then it becomes really reasonable.

2371
02:09:39.570 --> 02:09:42.840
Cause if you can pay a couple hundred bucks and fly across the country,

2372
02:09:42.841 --> 02:09:45.510
which you can,
if you get a good deal,
that's amazing.

2373
02:09:45.570 --> 02:09:49.170
Someone's going to take you and bring you across the whole country and like a

2374
02:09:49.170 --> 02:09:51.360
few hours in a day and it's going to cost you a few hundred bucks.

2375
02:09:51.630 --> 02:09:55.140
Just pay the man to be uncomfortable for a few hours.
Jesus Christ.

2376
02:09:55.350 --> 02:09:59.460
It's worth it in that sense because otherwise I'm not starting to fucking pilot

2377
02:09:59.850 --> 02:10:02.700
airplane business,
are you?
You're not starting to pilot airplane.

2378
02:10:02.970 --> 02:10:06.150
Who's gonna fly people?
Who's going to,
how are we going to get there?

2379
02:10:06.180 --> 02:10:08.220
We're not going to get there.
What if there was no airlines?

2380
02:10:08.250 --> 02:10:11.640
Who is the government going to run the airlines?
Yeah.
Good.
Fucking luck.

2381
02:10:11.641 --> 02:10:14.010
It will be even more fucked up.
That'd be terrible.

2382
02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:18.900
Bunch of government workers flying into the ocean crashing shit.
You know,

2383
02:10:18.930 --> 02:10:23.130
it's,
it's um,
you,
you better hope the fucking airline.
Stay in business.

2384
02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:25.440
Pay Your money,
be uncomfortable.

2385
02:10:25.470 --> 02:10:27.420
Deal with it because I don't think they're making much money.

2386
02:10:27.450 --> 02:10:29.670
It seems like they're hurting.
You know?

2387
02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:33.040
It wouldn't be a good time to start up an airplane business at all.
Right.

2388
02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:34.130
Air travel

2389
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:38.380
<v 1>is tough and flights are expensive because oil is fucking expensive.</v>

2390
02:10:38.650 --> 02:10:40.080
So jet fuel's expensive.

2391
02:10:40.300 --> 02:10:41.350
<v 4>Fuck.</v>

2392
02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:45.400
And how much money it must cost to fly a plane across the ocean.

2393
02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:50.080
How much money is that in?
Gas must be a stupid amount of money.
I would think so.

2394
02:10:50.081 --> 02:10:52.180
I mean,
it's so fucking big,
but I don't know.

2395
02:10:52.330 --> 02:10:54.520
It's incredible that people were doing that in the 60s though.

2396
02:10:55.090 --> 02:10:58.900
the 60s those stupid fucks didn't have access to anything but books.

2397
02:10:59.590 --> 02:11:02.140
There was no phones.
If you weren't talking to anybody,

2398
02:11:02.141 --> 02:11:05.260
if you wear it right in front of them or you get them on a land line,

2399
02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:08.170
you know there was no cell phones,
then we'll just drive it around.

2400
02:11:08.171 --> 02:11:12.190
Calling the people no matter where you are and looking up facts on Google.
No,

2401
02:11:12.250 --> 02:11:14.380
but yet they were flying all over the country.

2402
02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:16.570
They were going all over the world.
You know,

2403
02:11:16.660 --> 02:11:19.600
I wonder if we're going to see like an alternative power source that's strong

2404
02:11:19.601 --> 02:11:22.300
and have to be able to fly planes,
but that fuel,
you know,

2405
02:11:22.301 --> 02:11:25.870
where you're almost like on a collider or electric car of an airplane.

2406
02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:26.733
You know what I mean?

2407
02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:31.540
<v 1>If the idea is that if Tesla's inventions had ever come to fruition,</v>

2408
02:11:31.570 --> 02:11:36.500
one of them being wireless electricity that could have been shooting low reality

2409
02:11:36.510 --> 02:11:40.860
airplane.
Yeah.
We could have developed some sort of a,
I don't understand it,

2410
02:11:40.861 --> 02:11:42.690
so I can't even comment on how they would do it.

2411
02:11:42.810 --> 02:11:44.490
I don't know how you broadcast electricity,

2412
02:11:44.491 --> 02:11:47.430
but the idea was that he would do it almost like you'd be able to pull it out of

2413
02:11:47.431 --> 02:11:50.760
the air,
like on a radio signal.
That'd be cool.
Yeah,
I guess.

2414
02:11:50.761 --> 02:11:53.640
Or it would be terrible because then an air flight would never work because

2415
02:11:53.641 --> 02:11:57.090
people would be fucking exploding in your planes because you're running into an

2416
02:11:57.091 --> 02:11:58.470
electrical circuit.
Like right.

2417
02:11:58.471 --> 02:12:00.630
When some kids shutting off his light bulb or something,

2418
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:05.520
the larger started sends a short up the wire and you know up to that through the

2419
02:12:05.521 --> 02:12:08.670
air and the electricity in the air and Zaps your playing.
Who knows?

2420
02:12:08.910 --> 02:12:10.740
Obviously that's not how electricity works,

2421
02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:15.060
but with any sort of a breakthrough discovery,

2422
02:12:15.061 --> 02:12:19.800
like you know air,
electricity,
you're going to have some,
some more problems.

2423
02:12:19.890 --> 02:12:20.723
Right.

2424
02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:24.300
Especially now the Tesla is dead if they tried to using his information without

2425
02:12:24.301 --> 02:12:25.134
his brain.

2426
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:29.490
You know how many people are capable of like brain Tesla's inventions to

2427
02:12:29.491 --> 02:12:31.020
fruition even today.

2428
02:12:31.450 --> 02:12:34.430
<v 4>I know I keep on thinking about the band test lead and just makes it,
yeah,</v>

2429
02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:37.980
isn't it funny?
The Band Tesla,
they,

2430
02:12:37.981 --> 02:12:41.380
they were kind of lame and they hijacked one of the greatest women's history.

2431
02:12:41.810 --> 02:12:46.010
Ego check.
Tick somebody way too cool for yourself.
Yeah.
That's kind of silly.

2432
02:12:46.850 --> 02:12:50.810
I guess they were fans of his,
that's why they did it,
but you know what?

2433
02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:53.090
I'm a fan of his too.
I don't call myself Tesla.

2434
02:12:53.091 --> 02:12:56.910
I know who isn't come up with your own band name,
man.
You hijack that dude's leg.

2435
02:12:56.911 --> 02:13:00.430
It's like almost like saying I'm Godzilla or I'm something like that.

2436
02:13:00.460 --> 02:13:04.640
You know the band?
Yeah.
Do your phone's going off kitty cat again

2437
02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:09.710
way over three hours?
No.
Would not.
Well I mean the two podcasts.

2438
02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:13.630
Oh if you put them together.
Yeah.
But we're not doing that are we?

2439
02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:16.280
I was going through part one and part two.
Okay.
Do you wanna put them together?

2440
02:13:16.530 --> 02:13:19.810
I was trying to,
let's get crazy bro.
Let's get crazy.
Wow.

2441
02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:22.520
How long was the first one?
Uh,
I think like an hour.

2442
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:26.510
<v 1>We do it just like they do it.
That's how like regular people do podcasts.</v>

2443
02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:30.500
If you look at it like the regular podcasts,
most podcasts are an hour.
True.

2444
02:13:30.530 --> 02:13:32.130
We're the only ones wander on

2445
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:33.470
<v 2>hours and hours.</v>

2446
02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:35.910
But the problem with us is sometimes we get to a spot we don't know in the

2447
02:13:35.911 --> 02:13:40.350
fucking end,
they know how to end.
They know at time to bring this baby around.

2448
02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:42.690
They know,
they know how to end.
We don't know how to end Brian.

2449
02:13:43.530 --> 02:13:45.270
Sometimes we're lost in a world of not ending.

2450
02:13:46.710 --> 02:13:47.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2451
02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:51.830
<v 2>Imagine if you had your own Concorde Cardigan space cause they essentially</v>

2452
02:13:51.831 --> 02:13:54.200
reached space.
They're like right at the edge of space.

2453
02:13:54.620 --> 02:13:57.890
Like a little higher and their it space cause I think they fly like way higher

2454
02:13:57.891 --> 02:14:02.320
than a regular jet.
Would you ever get on a hot air balloon new?
Not Interested.

2455
02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:06.410
Terrified of that.
You should be.
Fuck that.

2456
02:14:07.250 --> 02:14:07.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2457
02:14:07.590 --> 02:14:12.090
<v 2>Yeah.
Hot Air balloons are fucked up,
man.
That's a,
that's a,</v>

2458
02:14:12.150 --> 02:14:15.150
that's a tough thing to control.
No,
I don't think that's like,

2459
02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:18.000
I wonder how many of you will die every year and hot air balloon accidents,

2460
02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:21.750
but it happens sometimes the buildings catch on fire.
Oh Shit.

2461
02:14:23.010 --> 02:14:26.010
I think just the feeling of standing in a basket to,

2462
02:14:26.011 --> 02:14:28.560
I'm feeling like the wicker underneath your feet.
You know,

2463
02:14:28.590 --> 02:14:33.420
I'm trying to find an altitude here.
Let me see something else.
Services.

2464
02:14:40.050 --> 02:14:43.330
Dad doesn't say what their altitude is.
I'm trying to find out how,

2465
02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:47.350
how high these things went.
So,
oh here it is.

2466
02:14:47.410 --> 02:14:52.000
Oh my God,
you ready for this?
A regular plane is like,
what?

2467
02:14:52.001 --> 02:14:56.140
30,000 feet occasionally.
34,000 feet,
something like that.
Right.

2468
02:14:56.380 --> 02:15:00.040
Occasionally the pilot to come on and say,
we've reached 35,000 feet.

2469
02:15:00.041 --> 02:15:02.080
Our cruising level,
cruising altitude,

2470
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:07.210
Concord's maximum cruising altitude was 60,000 feet.

2471
02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:09.893
<v 0>Dude,</v>

2472
02:15:11.150 --> 02:15:12.110
<v 2>what the fuck?</v>

2473
02:15:12.111 --> 02:15:17.111
Sixty thousand sixty thousand feet sub sock airliners typically cruise below

2474
02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:22.880
40,000 feet above 50,000 feet.

2475
02:15:22.881 --> 02:15:27.881
The lack of air pressure would give a time of useful consciousness in even a

2476
02:15:28.581 --> 02:15:32.750
conditioned athlete of no more than five to 10 seconds.

2477
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:36.320
Isn't that nuts?

2478
02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:43.210
So apparently you can do it only because I,

2479
02:15:43.230 --> 02:15:47.610
that's incredible.
Is it?
Because of that,
the way the plant is built,

2480
02:15:47.950 --> 02:15:50.430
Concorde is out to the air.
Density is very low.

2481
02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:54.840
A breach of cabin integrity would result in a loss of pressure severe enough so

2482
02:15:54.841 --> 02:15:59.700
that plastic emergency oxygen mass installed on other passenger jets would not

2483
02:15:59.701 --> 02:16:04.701
be effective and pastures would quickly suffer from hypoxia despite quickly

2484
02:16:05.931 --> 02:16:07.040
donning the masks.

2485
02:16:07.041 --> 02:16:10.610
Concorde was equipped with smaller windows to reduce the rate of loss in the

2486
02:16:10.611 --> 02:16:12.590
event of a breach.
Wow.

2487
02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:17.720
A reserve air supply system to augment cabin pressure and a rapid descent

2488
02:16:17.721 --> 02:16:22.580
procedure to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude.
Holy Shit.
It just dives down.

2489
02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.860
Oh my God,
that was be horrifying.

2490
02:16:25.070 --> 02:16:28.850
Could you imagine if your shit breached and you just felt the plane point down

2491
02:16:28.851 --> 02:16:33.610
at earth and just,
yeah,
just straight down.
Oh my God.

2492
02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:36.810
<v 0>God.
Wow.</v>

2493
02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:42.720
<v 2>So they stopped flying,
I guess in the eighties or excuse me,</v>

2494
02:16:42.721 --> 02:16:46.740
2003
that's amazing,
man.

2495
02:16:47.100 --> 02:16:50.820
That must've been a fun fucking thing to do.
You mean your 60,000 feet up?

2496
02:16:50.821 --> 02:16:54.750
I think it's dark out.
Even when it's daytime.
I think you're in space.

2497
02:16:55.780 --> 02:16:59.410
No,
I think it's 60,000 feet.
You're like,
you're really close to space.

2498
02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:00.670
You know like it doesn't,

2499
02:17:00.671 --> 02:17:04.090
the sky doesn't look like the blue sky that you see in a normal jet when you're

2500
02:17:04.091 --> 02:17:05.500
just floating above the clouds.

2501
02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:07.840
You know that beautiful feeling when you're in a jet,

2502
02:17:07.841 --> 02:17:10.960
you look out the window and it's just smooth sailing and you're above the
clouds.

2503
02:17:10.961 --> 02:17:14.710
Like wow,
that's so peaceful and beautiful.
I guess you're way above that shit.

2504
02:17:14.740 --> 02:17:19.120
You're where it becomes dark.
Right?
Ooh,
that'd be cool to see that.
Ooh,

2505
02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:23.200
that'd be awesome,
man.
It'd be awesome if we all had fighter jets to,
I mean,

2506
02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:27.640
you know,
I,
I just do that bit about being in an FAA 18 what does this thing,
man,

2507
02:17:27.770 --> 02:17:30.780
no trouble.
Oh,
hot air balloon accident.

2508
02:17:31.710 --> 02:17:33.210
Oh No.

2509
02:17:33.370 --> 02:17:36.160
<v 8>The balloon check out that picture there.
You can see it was ripped open.</v>

2510
02:17:36.161 --> 02:17:38.620
It fell to the ground from about 500 feet.

2511
02:17:38.770 --> 02:17:42.100
Oh my three people suffered only minor injuries.
Amazingly,

2512
02:17:42.101 --> 02:17:46.950
the paraglider had non life threatening head and spinal injuries.
That's crazy.

2513
02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:51.340
<v 2>Snaps on.
That's not good.
Hey,
let's wrap this thing up.</v>

2514
02:17:51.550 --> 02:17:56.080
Brian Reichel this weekend the Braya Improv,

2515
02:17:56.390 --> 02:17:59.980
we'll be doing it with a Ari Shaffir end.

2516
02:18:00.370 --> 02:18:03.700
Duncan Trussell and this will be the first time that Dunkin is performing with

2517
02:18:03.701 --> 02:18:06.370
Ari in quite a while.
I think it's going to be fascinating,

2518
02:18:06.650 --> 02:18:11.180
especially considering,
well,
whatever.
Anyway,

2519
02:18:11.181 --> 02:18:12.300
we're going to have a good time frame.

2520
02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:15.170
Probably most likely it's going to sell out.
I go,
yes,
yes.

2521
02:18:15.171 --> 02:18:19.250
I am doing a lot of new shit.
Yes.
I have a lot of the,
uh,
I'm,
I'm performing,

2522
02:18:19.550 --> 02:18:23.360
I'm getting ready rather tightening up my shit for April 20th cause it looks

2523
02:18:23.361 --> 02:18:26.330
like April 20th in Atlanta is what I'm going to shoot my next special.

2524
02:18:26.331 --> 02:18:30.240
I got to get going.
I've had the same material that I've been winning.

2525
02:18:30.270 --> 02:18:32.810
We'll looking to put down on DVD for a long time now.

2526
02:18:32.811 --> 02:18:37.190
It's been like I think two years since my last recording.
So I got a lot of shit.

2527
02:18:37.191 --> 02:18:41.440
I gotta get it out there and then start fresh,
which is terrifying.
Uh,

2528
02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:42.250
but we'll do it.

2529
02:18:42.250 --> 02:18:45.500
A lot of those start fresh shows here at the Pasadena Ice House cause it's such

2530
02:18:45.501 --> 02:18:48.710
an intimate environment.
It's great for coming up with new shit.
So that's my,

2531
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:50.300
that's my mission right now.
I'm on a mission.

2532
02:18:50.510 --> 02:18:54.410
My mission is to get out this special and then come up with a whole new hour in

2533
02:18:54.590 --> 02:18:55.840
a couple of months.
So I'll do,

2534
02:18:55.910 --> 02:19:00.680
I'm going to do a lot of shows after April in May,
June,
July before.

2535
02:19:01.010 --> 02:19:05.540
So I'll have like a few months before the special comes out when it gets edited

2536
02:19:05.541 --> 02:19:08.360
and all that Shit.
And in this in the months before,

2537
02:19:08.450 --> 02:19:10.250
I'm going to have to come up with a whole new hour.

2538
02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:14.810
So that should be fascinating.
So I'll be doing a lot of shows.
Um,
and um,

2539
02:19:15.290 --> 02:19:19.970
that's it.
Thanks to uh,
the fleshlight for sponsoring the program.

2540
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:24.380
Thanks to um,
them.
You can buy a flashlight at a discount.

2541

sponsored by on it on it.com.
What is on it Joe Rogan?

2544
02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:39.680
Weight on it is on his God's company,
my friend.

2545
02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:42.980
We're here for you.
What Brian?
Pay Attention.

2546
02:19:43.310 --> 02:19:44.750
What are you doing holding your pipe up?

2547
02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:48.020
Is that the photo that everybody's saying?
It's silly.
Fucking pipe.
No kill.

2548
02:19:48.021 --> 02:19:51.440
You know,
you can see what I'm your son.
Love.
You light it up.

2549
02:19:51.470 --> 02:19:55.350
You know you want to,
it's ceramic infuse.
You don't have to worry anymore.
Um,

2550
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:57.490
thank you to see two.
Oh,
coconut water too.

2551
02:19:57.540 --> 02:20:00.920
They just sent me a bunch of fucking bad ass coconut water.

2552
02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:04.140
This is the most delicious.
It's from Thailand.
They're not even paying me.
Um,

2553
02:20:04.220 --> 02:20:08.600
thank you to [inaudible] dot com they are go to [inaudible] dot com o n n I t

2555
02:20:12.381 --> 02:20:15.260
shroom,
tech,

new mood.
All good stuff.

2556
02:20:15.261 --> 02:20:18.620
All explained at [inaudible] dot com all stuff that I endorse and I use.

2557
02:20:19.050 --> 02:20:23.590
All right.
Tomorrow the powerful Greg Fitzsimmons will be joining us.
Greg is,

2558
02:20:24.110 --> 02:20:28.160
Greg is my buddy from,
uh,
literally like we started out like within the first,

2559
02:20:28.190 --> 02:20:30.170
within the same month of each other.

2560
02:20:30.171 --> 02:20:32.750
I think we're like maybe a week or two apart from each other.

2561
02:20:32.751 --> 02:20:35.860
So we've known each other a long time.
We've got a lot of fun,
crazy story.

2562
02:20:35.861 --> 02:20:40.310
She's hilarious.
He's a great dude.
And uh,
he'll be here tomorrow,
so.

2563
02:20:40.311 --> 02:20:42.320
Well that's it.
We've got a lot of shit coming up,
honey.
Honey,

2564
02:20:42.321 --> 02:20:46.370
he's got to do the podcast next week as is Sam Harris.
Holla.

2565
02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:50.840
Atcha boy.
So I'll see you dirty freak soon.
Thank you for tuning in.
As always.

2566
02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:54.080
We appreciate you very much.
And,
uh,
this podcast,
you know,

2567
02:20:54.081 --> 02:20:57.130
a lot of people come up to us and talk to us on Twitter and say that,
you know,

2568
02:20:57.140 --> 02:20:58.670
this is a huge part of your life now and it's,

2569
02:20:58.910 --> 02:21:02.360
it's so much fun and you grow from it and you learn things from it.
We do too,

2570
02:21:02.390 --> 02:21:02.810
you know.

2571
02:21:02.810 --> 02:21:06.590
But forcing myself to do something like this and doing it so often and exposing

2572
02:21:06.591 --> 02:21:09.050
myself to all these cool conversations with all these cool people,

2573
02:21:09.051 --> 02:21:13.760
I am benefiting just as much as you are.
And I appreciate you guys to no end.

2574
02:21:13.790 --> 02:21:17.860
It is the coolest thing in the world to work at a place and then have the wait

2575
02:21:17.861 --> 02:21:21.590
staff and everyone say,
man,
do your fans are so nice.

2576
02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:25.820
And I hear it all the time and I just want you guys to know that I appreciate

2577
02:21:25.850 --> 02:21:28.820
that more than anything.
I'm proud of that more than anything.

2578
02:21:28.821 --> 02:21:30.650
I think it's the coolest fucking thing in the world.

2579
02:21:30.860 --> 02:21:34.670
And I think if you put something out there,
it's like it's proof positive.

2580
02:21:34.671 --> 02:21:39.110
Be a cool person and be a nice person.
Try to at best times,

2581
02:21:39.111 --> 02:21:43.790
always at every turn,
tried to be as cool about something as he can.

2582
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:45.890
Well,
no one's perfect.
We're all going to fuck up.

2583
02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:50.840
But if you go through life with that sort of a motto,
don't be a con.

2584
02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:55.280
Try to keep moving forward.
Get your shit together.
Be Nice to people.

2585
02:21:55.700 --> 02:21:58.580
How hard is that?
It's not that hard,
right?
Brian?
Have a good time.

2586
02:21:58.610 --> 02:22:01.340
This shit is temporary.
It's not gonna last.

2587
02:22:01.610 --> 02:22:06.050
You got to wake the fuck up and realize that time to enjoy this fucking thing

2588
02:22:06.051 --> 02:22:09.950
for the mad lunacy of what it really is.
The Times right now,

2589
02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:12.710
enjoy this fucking thing.
Enjoy the shit out of it.

2590
02:22:12.860 --> 02:22:15.980
Cut Out those people in your life that you're not enjoying negative people.

2591
02:22:15.981 --> 02:22:19.670
Vampires.
Cut them out.
Cut.
Cut Out all the bullshit that's holding you down.

2592
02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:24.890
Scam and scheme and plot away to get out of your job.
Do it all.

2593
02:22:25.320 --> 02:22:26.153
Don't get me wrong.

2594
02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:29.160
<v 1>Find out a way to do what you really want to do.
You can.</v>

2595
02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:34.380
This fucking is getting way too.
Um,
now I'm like,
no,
I'm a motivational speaker.

2596
02:22:34.590 --> 02:22:36.330
I've gotten Anthony Robbins on everybody.
Look,

2597
02:22:36.331 --> 02:22:38.130
