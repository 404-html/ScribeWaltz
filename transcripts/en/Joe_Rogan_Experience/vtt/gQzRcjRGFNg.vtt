<v Speaker 1>Very nice to meet you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to meet you.</v>

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're live.</v>

4
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just to give everybody a good way to</v>

5
00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:14.630
<v Speaker 2>start this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a book.</v>

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.030
<v Speaker 2>A book is called the desert in the sea</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have one of the most disturbing</v>

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.760
<v Speaker 2>and craziest stories I think I ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>read.</v>

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.200
<v Speaker 2>You were kidnapped by Somali pirates and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were held hostage for more than two</v>

9
00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:31.034
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.910
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck was that like and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it feel like to be a free man now?</v>

11
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 2>After all that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding?</v>

12
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:41.870
<v Speaker 2>It feels great in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wandering around the valley,</v>

13
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.690
<v Speaker 2>the valley where I was born and raised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

14
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.590
<v Speaker 2>are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.020
<v Speaker 2>this is the first time I've been back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the valley for a couple of years now.</v>

16
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.183
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

17
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.030
<v Speaker 2>what happened and how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did it happen?</v>

18
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Long Story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>so I went to Somalia in the first place</v>
<v Speaker 1>to write a book,</v>

20
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:02.660
<v Speaker 1>a very different books about Somali</v>
<v Speaker 1>pirates right in front of me.</v>

21
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.440
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

22
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was working in Berlin at the time and</v>

23
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:12.921
<v Speaker 1>I had followed a very long trial of 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somali pirates in Germany in Hamburg for</v>

24
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 1>about a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of 2011.</v>

25
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.160
<v Speaker 1>And before that I had already thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>about going to Somalia because the</v>

26
00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:23.190
<v Speaker 1>pirate story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting and all sorts of ways</v>

27
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>that I thought other writers weren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting to.</v>

28
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.220
<v Speaker 1>And I had met another journalist to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary maker named Ashwin Romano</v>

29
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.510
<v Speaker 1>who also wanted to go to Somalia for his</v>
<v Speaker 1>own project.</v>

30
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we talked about going for a long time</v>

31
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>and by the end of 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the middle of the trial.</v>

32
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>We all are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plans came together and we wound up</v>

33
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:49.761
<v Speaker 1>going in January of 2012 and we had</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 10 days of good research.</v>

34
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we both got pretty good material and we</v>

35
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>were in a part of Somalia where other</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists had gone.</v>

36
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>So we weren't doing something that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally off the map,</v>

37
00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:58.884
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

38
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the 10th day Ashwin flew off to</v>

39
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Mogadishu and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>I went with him to the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw him off.</v>

41
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.860
<v Speaker 1>And it was on the way back from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>airport that um,</v>

42
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>a truck was waiting for our car and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truck,</v>

43
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.820
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a technical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a battle wagon with a candidate in</v>

44
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>the back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped us,</v>

45
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>aim the cannon through the windshield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overpowered my Gourd and 12 guys with</v>

46
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Kalashnikovs pulled me out of the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was gonna put me in another car and</v>

47
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>we drove off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from that moment on,</v>

48
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:33.594
<v Speaker 1>I was a captive</v>

49
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.100
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they were obviously trying to get</v>

50
00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:40.070
<v Speaker 2>some hostage.</v>

51
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

52
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.170
<v Speaker 1>it was about money and I think they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping for both of us,</v>

53
00:02:44.171 --> 00:02:46.870
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Ashwin feels very lucky that he</v>

54
00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:49.300
<v Speaker 1>didn't get captured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had planned this.</v>

55
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were probably waiting for our</v>

56
00:02:50.981 --> 00:02:54.700
<v Speaker 1>car earlier in the morning when it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just Ashwyn's good luck that we took a</v>

57
00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:58.240
<v Speaker 1>different route to the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much money were they asking for the.</v>

58
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the first they asked for me was</v>

59
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>$20,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was after the first week.</v>

60
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>So I went for a week without having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone call home.</v>

61
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that period seals rescued two</v>

62
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>other hostages from another part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>central Somalia,</v>

63
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.930
<v Speaker 1>including Jessica Buchanan in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>American and I think nine Somali guards</v>

64
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:24.421
<v Speaker 1>died in that raid and they had some Klan</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to some of the guys holding</v>

65
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the guy's holding me were very</v>

66
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>upset and I think that's why they asked</v>
<v Speaker 1>for $20 million and help more</v>

67
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>importantly held onto that demand for so</v>
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

68
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>what they held onto it for almost a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

69
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>that specific number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't budge.</v>

70
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>So they were in negotiations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

71
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>there were negotiations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were,</v>

72
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phoning negotiations in some sense</v>

73
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Speaker 1>because the Somalis weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't really negotiating.</v>

74
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.260
<v Speaker 2>So for some background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people that are unfamiliar with the</v>

75
00:03:51.261 --> 00:03:54.320
<v Speaker 2>situation in Somalia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somalia,</v>

76
00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:59.321
<v Speaker 2>if you correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that area was traditionally fishermen</v>

77
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.450
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

78
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.400
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually the point of the</v>

79
00:04:04.401 --> 00:04:07.830
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually one level of the title</v>

80
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:09.530
<v Speaker 1>of the desert in the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's uh,</v>

81
00:04:09.531 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

82
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.300
<v Speaker 1>you get the idea from things that Somali</v>
<v Speaker 1>pirates like to say,</v>

83
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.420
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're just frustrated fishermen.</v>

84
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only part of the story.</v>

85
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.640
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very important premise in the</v>

86
00:04:22.641 --> 00:04:23.474
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

87
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.620
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

88
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.010
<v Speaker 1>fishing communities on the coast and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're being hard hit definitely by</v>

90
00:04:31.011 --> 00:04:34.100
<v Speaker 1>illegal ships that come in to steal the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>

91
00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:35.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a problem up and down in</v>

92
00:04:35.781 --> 00:04:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that problem,</v>

93
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.770
<v Speaker 1>once Somalia had no government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no navy navy to defend the</v>

94
00:04:44.961 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 1>coastline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

95
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.410
<v Speaker 1>local sort of clan leaders would send</v>
<v Speaker 1>out militia boats with militiamen and</v>

96
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>hold fishing boats for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.890
<v Speaker 1>$50,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ransoms over 24 hour periods,</v>

98
00:04:57.891 --> 00:04:59.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really nothing very much.</v>

99
00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:02.720
<v Speaker 1>And they called it a license fee and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you did business in Somalia</v>

100
00:05:02.721 --> 00:05:04.640
<v Speaker 1>in the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't hear about that.</v>

101
00:05:04.641 --> 00:05:07.460
<v Speaker 1>It was too small time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started to hear about it when they</v>

102
00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:10.190
<v Speaker 1>graduated to capturing cargo ships.</v>

103
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.820
<v Speaker 2>What I'd heard was that there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal dumping that wasn't just</v>

104
00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:15.654
<v Speaker 2>fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

105
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.823
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

106
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.150
<v Speaker 2>And that they initially called</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves the people's coast guard of</v>

107
00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Somalia or the voluntary coastguard one</v>
<v Speaker 2>or</v>

108
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.020
<v Speaker 1>a pirate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

109
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.700
<v Speaker 1>gangs tried to call themselves that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a point,</v>

110
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.070
<v Speaker 1>there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one else patrolling the coast,</v>

111
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.140
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't really what was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

112
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.993
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

113
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I was captured on land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

114
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.770
<v Speaker 1>every other Qa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hostage I met was a fisherman.</v>

115
00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:43.980
<v Speaker 1>A poor fishermen captured hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles from the Somali coast.</v>

116
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.360
<v Speaker 1>So that's not protecting the cost.</v>

117
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.700
<v Speaker 2>So what role does this stuff called cat</v>
<v Speaker 2>k,</v>

118
00:05:50.701 --> 00:05:55.701
<v Speaker 2>h a t this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a plant that they chew and it has</v>

119
00:05:56.281 --> 00:05:57.970
<v Speaker 2>like a stimulant effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

120
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit like coca leaf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think actually it's a narcotic</v>

121
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.650
<v Speaker 1>gets you high at first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

122
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 1>and then you crash and you wake up</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and you need more.</v>

123
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these guys,</v>

124
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 1>every single pirate I met was addicted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

125
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.400
<v Speaker 1>and they wound up having to sit in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these piles of cut every afternoon</v>

126
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>just to get high enough for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction.</v>

127
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then like I said,</v>

128
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would crash at night and then do it</v>

129
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my case,</v>

130
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were guards 24 hours a day,</v>

131
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:32.040
<v Speaker 1>which meant there was also a shift that</v>
<v Speaker 1>slept during the day to cut at night and</v>

132
00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then crash in the morning.</v>

133
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 1>What did you try any of that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

134
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kept offering it to me.</v>

135
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like they know take like two</v>
<v Speaker 1>or three stems with three or four times</v>

136
00:06:43.631 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

137
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Not much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it changed your mood,</v>

138
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be depressed and you'd feel</v>

139
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 1>better or you can be a little bit sick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just wouldn't feel it anymore.</v>

140
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't want to get addicted to it,</v>

141
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:57.730
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't keep pushing it.</v>

142
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Speaker 1>It's that addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

143
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>

144
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:02.570
<v Speaker 1>I saw how addictive it could be with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guards.</v>

145
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 1>a little bit on an afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't make me want to keep doing it</v>

147
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:08.140
<v Speaker 1>necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every,</v>

148
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.220
<v Speaker 1>every now and then I did it just for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sake of my mood.</v>

149
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.120
<v Speaker 2>That's always in the narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This cat stuff,</v>

151
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.330
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are some how or another unhinged</v>

152
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.830
<v Speaker 2>because they're on this stuff all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

153
00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can get really unhinged in</v>

154
00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:22.510
<v Speaker 2>the sense that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you're wired on it,</v>

155
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.370
<v Speaker 1>you're easily sort of upset and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys would have sometimes have</v>

156
00:07:26.371 --> 00:07:27.990
<v Speaker 1>fistfights in front of me and that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

157
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.520
<v Speaker 1>We're not all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

158
00:07:29.521 --> 00:07:31.920
<v Speaker 1>they would get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would get hopped up,</v>

159
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.190
<v Speaker 1>they would just get jittery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very dangerous with</v>

160
00:07:35.191 --> 00:07:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Kalashnikovs lying around.</v>

161
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.040
<v Speaker 2>So their culture somehow or another has</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved to this point where it's</v>

162
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:47.670
<v Speaker 2>insanely common to kidnap people to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>point where if you,</v>

163
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.970
<v Speaker 2>if you talk about Somali pirates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

164
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.060
<v Speaker 2>the very few countries were pirates go</v>
<v Speaker 2>after their name so easily.</v>

165
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

166
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.740
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

167
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.500
<v Speaker 1>kidnapping became part of the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

168
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 1>But pirate bosses which are not so</v>
<v Speaker 1>active now off the coast,</v>

169
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm also have other businesses that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get involved in.</v>

170
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.740
<v Speaker 1>And so I've written about this in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>meantime to they they get involved in a</v>

171
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.750
<v Speaker 1>gun smuggling and also even people</v>
<v Speaker 1>smuggling on the Horn of Africa.</v>

172
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.190
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

173
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.470
<v Speaker 1>whatever it takes that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment,</v>

174
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suv,</v>

175
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Kalashnikovs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap food.</v>

176
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.510
<v Speaker 1>When you say people smuggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

177
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good story.</v>

178
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.300
<v Speaker 1>I found out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

179
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the person that proved that on the</v>

180
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:33.850
<v Speaker 1>route between Somalia to Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

181
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.740
<v Speaker 1>some former pirate bosses were active</v>
<v Speaker 1>and moving people,</v>

182
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.540
<v Speaker 1>so in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somalis who want to go to Libya will put</v>

183
00:08:41.541 --> 00:08:43.640
<v Speaker 1>themselves in the hands of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>traffickers and some of those</v>

184
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:45.020
<v Speaker 1>traffickers might be x pirates,</v>

185
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.640
<v Speaker 2>but w w go there as far as just being</v>
<v Speaker 2>transported willingly,</v>

186
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.080
<v Speaker 2>willingly at first.</v>

187
00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:53.760
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

188
00:08:53.761 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 1>there's always a place in Sudan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shifts from being willing to being</v>

189
00:08:58.381 --> 00:08:59.214
<v Speaker 1>unwilling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

190
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 1>this is an issue that's been going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya recently.</v>

191
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you saw the most recent slave</v>

192
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 1>auctions that were videotaped and put on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>

193
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:10.010
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories are awful.</v>

194
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I've heard this firsthand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

195
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.400
<v Speaker 1>insanely disturbing that you're watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>a video tape of slave auctions in 2018</v>

196
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.630
<v Speaker 1>as well as more than disturbing it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>revival of what was going on when</v>

197
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 1>slavery was legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

198
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where the,</v>

199
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.730
<v Speaker 1>where the Somalis are involved up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

200
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.950
<v Speaker 1>to the Libyan border is one story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the story I've covered.</v>

201
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens in Libya is a different</v>

202
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:41.700
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The clans and the roots that migrants</v>

203
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 1>take through Libya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clans they put themselves in the</v>

204
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:49.281
<v Speaker 1>hands of 'em are still the same as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>clans and the routes that we used during</v>

205
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:51.234
<v Speaker 1>the slave trade.</v>

206
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>

207
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 1>there's almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a historical memory there of</v>

209
00:09:57.361 --> 00:10:00.240
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what went on and it's the same thing</v>

210
00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:01.074
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

211
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.660
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

212
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I suspect a lot of migrants don't quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>know how bad it can get a,</v>

213
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the route up until Libya is probably</v>

214
00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:14.760
<v Speaker 1>easier than Libya itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya itself sounds like a horror show</v>

215
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.760
<v Speaker 1>for the migrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

216
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's particularly,</v>

217
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those bizarre things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a horrible dictator like Walmart</v>

218
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Kadafi and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

219
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.250
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a good thing to get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy.</v>

220
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

221
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.710
<v Speaker 1>when you get rid of them then you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>this power vacuum and apparently it's a</v>

222
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:33.960
<v Speaker 1>failed state now and it's gotten even</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

223
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.440
<v Speaker 1>It's going in the direction of Somalia</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now in there,</v>

224
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 1>a couple of rival governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a little bit more stable,</v>

225
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 1>a than Somalia was after their dictator</v>
<v Speaker 1>fell,</v>

226
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:45.240
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's similar.</v>

227
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.070
<v Speaker 1>There's a similar thing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

228
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

229
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Gaddafi was a bad guy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was also a bulwark and he knew</v>

230
00:10:55.351 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 1>that and he used that to his advantage</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a bulwark against,</v>

231
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.310
<v Speaker 1>against migration paths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard that expression.</v>

232
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bulwark,</v>

233
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.220
<v Speaker 1>bulwark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what does that mean?</v>

234
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 1>A roadblock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

235
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:08.370
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

236
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.930
<v Speaker 1>when you were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you decided to take 10 days and</v>

237
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 1>you'd done all this research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

238
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.660
<v Speaker 1>what did you expect when you went there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what was different?</v>

239
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we were careful about finding</v>

240
00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:22.500
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found,</v>

241
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Somali elder in Berlin who could offer</v>

242
00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:31.170
<v Speaker 1>the protection of his clan in Somalia</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had done it with another</v>

243
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.550
<v Speaker 1>journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist,</v>

244
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:36.180
<v Speaker 1>a German journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he took us out from Galkayo,</v>

245
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:40.040
<v Speaker 1>which is a town in central Somalia out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the coast to hope you,</v>

246
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.520
<v Speaker 1>which is a pirate town you might have</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard of.</v>

247
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.340
<v Speaker 1>And Hybrid town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Natural Pirate town.</v>

248
00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all pirates.</v>

249
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.183
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in,</v>

250
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.380
<v Speaker 1>it's in the control of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pirates.</v>

251
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government that sits in Galkayo has</v>

252
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:55.560
<v Speaker 1>no influence there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

253
00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.170
<v Speaker 1>the pirates are the ones with who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can have the say.</v>

254
00:11:59.171 --> 00:11:59.600
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

255
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.640
<v Speaker 2>So what is their business like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

256
00:12:01.641 --> 00:12:04.850
<v Speaker 2>when you say it's like a pirate town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the pirates are essentially in</v>

257
00:12:04.851 --> 00:12:07.310
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like what else is going on there?</v>

258
00:12:07.311 --> 00:12:08.144
<v Speaker 2>If you've got</v>

259
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.160
<v Speaker 1>control?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

260
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.810
<v Speaker 1>normal Somali life is going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

261
00:12:11.811 --> 00:12:12.644
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

262
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the police force would be</v>

263
00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:17.220
<v Speaker 1>pirates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

264
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean when we got there it was pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet and we didn't see much normal life</v>

265
00:12:21.771 --> 00:12:25.970
<v Speaker 1>and we had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very organized interview and</v>

266
00:12:25.971 --> 00:12:27.450
<v Speaker 1>lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

267
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:31.430
<v Speaker 1>one afternoon with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a guy who turned out to be a real</v>

268
00:12:31.431 --> 00:12:32.920
<v Speaker 1>pirate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

269
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.330
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we,</v>

270
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.910
<v Speaker 1>we left around sundown and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was it.</v>

271
00:12:37.911 --> 00:12:39.420
<v Speaker 1>We didn't spend a whole lot of time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope you</v>

272
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.890
<v Speaker 2>when you were there and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

273
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.540
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eventually got captured and taken</v>

274
00:12:47.541 --> 00:12:48.740
<v Speaker 2>hostage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

275
00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.720
<v Speaker 2>what was the initial experience like?</v>

276
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when that happened with the,</v>

277
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.190
<v Speaker 1>with the technical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the truck at first,</v>

278
00:12:57.191 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 1>my mind actually recoiled from what was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

279
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually was in denial for a couple of</v>

280
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:02.320
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

281
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:03.800
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a roadblock,</v>

282
00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.290
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

283
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:09.100
<v Speaker 1>but once they captured me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought this is gonna be really hard</v>

284
00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:13.370
<v Speaker 1>on my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus and they,</v>

285
00:13:13.371 --> 00:13:14.204
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

286
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 1>they beat me with their guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They broke my wrist,</v>

287
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.860
<v Speaker 1>they bloodied my scout a and they broke</v>
<v Speaker 1>my glasses.</v>

288
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.640
<v Speaker 1>So that's the other thing I noticed</v>
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

289
00:13:22.641 --> 00:13:23.750
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

290
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about uh,</v>

291
00:13:25.781 --> 00:13:27.540
<v Speaker 1>your odds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm nearsighted,</v>

292
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good</v>

293
00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.770
<v Speaker 2>and this is like initial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right away?</v>

294
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:34.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

295
00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:37.290
<v Speaker 1>It happened in that first skirmish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

296
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.930
<v Speaker 1>So your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wrist was broken right away because</v>

297
00:13:39.931 --> 00:13:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to hold the car door closed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they pounded on it with their gun</v>

298
00:13:43.741 --> 00:13:44.574
<v Speaker 1>barrels.</v>

299
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

300
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.073
<v Speaker 2>is it hard to talk?</v>

301
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

302
00:13:51.711 --> 00:13:55.220
<v Speaker 1>because now I've written the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have been able to do this</v>

303
00:13:55.221 --> 00:13:58.820
<v Speaker 1>before writing the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but reading the book familiarized myself</v>

304
00:13:58.821 --> 00:13:59.950
<v Speaker 1>with my own memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

305
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.950
<v Speaker 1>it made me fluent with this material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your physical state seems to shift</v>

306
00:14:03.951 --> 00:14:05.150
<v Speaker 1>when you discuss it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

307
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.223
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe</v>

308
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.170
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

309
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.330
<v Speaker 2>your shoulders have risen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

310
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.610
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

311
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a question of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

312
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.290
<v Speaker 2>it's just not pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine.</v>

313
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

314
00:14:17.221 --> 00:14:21.090
<v Speaker 2>it must have been just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

315
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.450
<v Speaker 2>so you said there was a long period of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time before.</v>

316
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Were your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they contacted anybody,</v>

317
00:14:27.001 --> 00:14:28.230
<v Speaker 2>who do they contact?</v>

318
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

319
00:14:29.921 --> 00:14:34.921
<v Speaker 1>So it was a week and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had a grant reporting grant from</v>

320
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:38.110
<v Speaker 1>the Pulitzer Center on crisis reporting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should've called them.</v>

321
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had all my notes stolen,</v>

322
00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:46.051
<v Speaker 1>which means all my phone numbers too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when they finally brought me up</v>

323
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:49.480
<v Speaker 1>to a bluff with a little cell phone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

324
00:14:49.481 --> 00:14:50.470
<v Speaker 1>call somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

325
00:14:50.471 --> 00:14:51.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring me my notes.</v>

326
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:52.910
<v Speaker 1>I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

327
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.380
<v Speaker 1>find the right phone number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

328
00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:55.280
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just call someone.</v>

329
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.980
<v Speaker 1>So I called my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

330
00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what happened by that.</v>

331
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.000
<v Speaker 1>By that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the FBI had informed her,</v>

332
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.530
<v Speaker 1>had actually come to her door and</v>
<v Speaker 1>briefed her a little on what to say on</v>

333
00:15:09.531 --> 00:15:10.550
<v Speaker 1>the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

334
00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:12.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was ready for the phone call,</v>

335
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd been sitting around for days</v>

336
00:15:15.651 --> 00:15:17.360
<v Speaker 1>wondering when she was going hear from</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

337
00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

338
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.210
<v Speaker 1>but that was also true about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pulitzer Center was also true about my</v>

339
00:15:23.211 --> 00:15:24.950
<v Speaker 1>colleagues that should be go online in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Berlin.</v>

340
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.020
<v Speaker 1>It was also true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my family in Germany,</v>

341
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:31.670
<v Speaker 1>everyone had been briefed a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

342
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Were they waiting for a specific reason?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did they wait a whole week until</v>

343
00:15:35.671 --> 00:15:37.190
<v Speaker 1>they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good question.</v>

344
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I kept asking for a phone call and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>

345
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.360
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting there kind of in a panic</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

346
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were they saying to you during this</v>

347
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.091
<v Speaker 1>week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

348
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

349
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.260
<v Speaker 1>You have a broken arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

350
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.100
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously,</v>

351
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:51.130
<v Speaker 1>you're in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't see anymore.</v>

352
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in,</v>

353
00:15:52.361 --> 00:15:53.194
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>

354
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.300
<v Speaker 1>first they took me to a Bush camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they took me with a couple of other</v>

355
00:15:56.301 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Speaker 1>hostages to a prison house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

356
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:02.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my wrist in a sling and um,</v>

357
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.970
<v Speaker 1>it just was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was painful.</v>

358
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.380
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was confusing.</v>

359
00:16:09.381 --> 00:16:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't know what was going on.</v>

360
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.450
<v Speaker 1>And then slowly they brought a doctor in</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at the wrist and then slowly</v>

361
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:17.960
<v Speaker 1>they took us out into the bush and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally they do put me on the phone.</v>

362
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.710
<v Speaker 1>So you got medical treatment for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrist?</v>

363
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Sort of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

364
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.780
<v Speaker 1>The Guy said it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably a livestock doctor,</v>

365
00:16:26.781 --> 00:16:29.540
<v Speaker 1>but the guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a very sympathetic old,</v>

366
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.930
<v Speaker 1>older man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he said your wrist is not broken and</v>

367
00:16:32.931 --> 00:16:34.480
<v Speaker 1>he put a splint on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was it.</v>

368
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.240
<v Speaker 1>It was broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Broken in half,</v>

369
00:16:38.241 --> 00:16:39.660
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But definitely correct.</v>

370
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.750
<v Speaker 1>I felt I felt bones moving around in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

371
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.780
<v Speaker 1>It's been rearranged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been reshaped.</v>

372
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Did you eventually get medical treatment</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get home for you?</v>

373
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.841
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

374
00:16:49.841 --> 00:16:51.590
<v Speaker 1>I got home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the surgery,</v>

375
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.180
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years and eight months later it was,</v>

376
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.470
<v Speaker 1>it was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

377
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Sense of functioning restaurant.</v>

378
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

379
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.690
<v Speaker 1>it's set wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a functioning risk.</v>

380
00:16:58.691 --> 00:17:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Did you get an x Ray?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so you could see how weird it</v>

381
00:17:00.651 --> 00:17:01.970
<v Speaker 1>looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even bother.</v>

382
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now when you're there,</v>

383
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:08.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you get the initial phone call,</v>

384
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.070
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the process like after that?</v>

385
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Are they there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they talking to you about what they</v>

386
00:17:12.141 --> 00:17:13.030
<v Speaker 1>want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

387
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.711
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

388
00:17:13.711 --> 00:17:16.100
<v Speaker 1>do you have to demand $20,000,000 from</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mother?</v>

389
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I must have smirked or</v>

390
00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:20.110
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said it's not funny.</v>

391
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually it is.</v>

392
00:17:21.431 --> 00:17:23.120
<v Speaker 1>That's not a serious demand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

393
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was their opening gambit.</v>

394
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.670
<v Speaker 1>20 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was specifically 20 million?</v>

395
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:33.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are the first two hostages I was</v>

396
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:36.740
<v Speaker 1>held with to say Wa fishermen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

397
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.690
<v Speaker 1>the rent and for them was also 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>

398
00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:41.270
<v Speaker 1>but that's 10 million each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe they were just doubling it for</v>

399
00:17:41.271 --> 00:17:42.104
<v Speaker 1>the American.</v>

400
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:47.830
<v Speaker 1>There was a time where they told you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if people showed up for you that</v>

401
00:17:48.261 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>you were going to be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

402
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:52.530
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said that right away because by the</v>

403
00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:57.531
<v Speaker 1>time the phone call had happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the raid for Jessica Buchanan and Poltis</v>

404
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.230
<v Speaker 1>dad had already happened too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

405
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they even mentioned that to me and of</v>

406
00:18:03.301 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 1>course I had no idea what they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

407
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:06.240
<v Speaker 1>I had no news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

408
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.600
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

409
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.650
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned it to my mother on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

410
00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:13.200
<v Speaker 1>I said they're talking about a rate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying if somebody else comes</v>

411
00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:14.490
<v Speaker 1>from me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get shot dead.</v>

412
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:15.340
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

413
00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.370
<v Speaker 1>those are already the terms of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kidnapping.</v>

414
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.240
<v Speaker 1>That was not a big change in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

415
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my mom could tell me very little on</v>

416
00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:26.010
<v Speaker 1>the phone about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the rescue,</v>

417
00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:29.100
<v Speaker 1>but she had something positive than your</v>
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>

418
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:29.671
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

419
00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:32.190
<v Speaker 1>the rescue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that doesn't sound like</v>

420
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.220
<v Speaker 1>the pirates of course told me the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hostages had been killed.</v>

421
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Like that doesn't sound like it went</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

422
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.370
<v Speaker 1>but it was still another month and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>half or something before I found out the</v>

423
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.204
<v Speaker 1>full story.</v>

424
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Two and a half years is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know two years and eight months.</v>

425
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.570
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you ate with them,</v>

426
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.620
<v Speaker 1>you got used to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you almost become friends with them?</v>

427
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became friends with,</v>

428
00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have friends with,</v>

429
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:03.800
<v Speaker 1>with about half the pirate guard group</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was with me at that point,</v>

430
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.310
<v Speaker 1>so I was held a number of places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also placed me on a tuna ship.</v>

431
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I was placed on a ship hijacked by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somali pirates for about five months and</v>

432
00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:17.400
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm the only western writer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know life on a ship like that.</v>

433
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Five months for the full spring and</v>
<v Speaker 1>summer of 2012.</v>

434
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.710
<v Speaker 1>And then it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was after that that was held on land.</v>

435
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm alone with the guards and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I got to know the guards.</v>

436
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.370
<v Speaker 1>You must've had this feeling like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're never going to find me.</v>

437
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.530
<v Speaker 1>They're moving me around and putting me</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a ship.</v>

438
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.600
<v Speaker 1>That was a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once the.</v>

439
00:19:39.601 --> 00:19:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Especially when they put me on the ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

440
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I felt like any progress the military</v>
<v Speaker 1>had made in finding my location would've</v>

441
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.850
<v Speaker 1>been completely reset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

442
00:19:50.851 --> 00:19:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I was terribly depressed when they first</v>
<v Speaker 1>put me on the ship.</v>

443
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were there for five months?</v>

444
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once I was on the ship,</v>

445
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I felt better because there were 28</v>
<v Speaker 1>other hostages,</v>

446
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.680
<v Speaker 1>the crew of the ship and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

447
00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

448
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.290
<v Speaker 1>it's always better to have company when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a accounting.</v>

449
00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

450
00:20:09.381 --> 00:20:11.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other people that were running the</v>

451
00:20:11.371 --> 00:20:13.380
<v Speaker 1>ship when they captured it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were there as well.</v>

452
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a crew of 20th guys from</v>

453
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.220
<v Speaker 1>East Asian and Southeast Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they speak English?</v>

454
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Only five of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so five of them were from the</v>

455
00:20:23.491 --> 00:20:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Philippines and we got along with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

456
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else we had to get to know</v>

457
00:20:29.701 --> 00:20:32.430
<v Speaker 1>somehow and the ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't speak to each other either</v>

458
00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:34.770
<v Speaker 1>because they had who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tower of Babel on the ship.</v>

459
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.800
<v Speaker 1>And so they've developed their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigeon,</v>

460
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.140
<v Speaker 1>which is what sailors have done for</v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries,</v>

461
00:20:40.141 --> 00:20:42.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a pigeon mixture of English and</v>

462
00:20:42.781 --> 00:20:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Chinese and a few other words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

463
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was fascinating.</v>

464
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could imagine now as a writer,</v>

465
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.720
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to be sort of like halfway torn.</v>

466
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:53.111
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

467
00:20:53.111 --> 00:20:55.840
<v Speaker 1>if I get out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a fucking story.</v>

468
00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

469
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

470
00:20:57.761 --> 00:20:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

471
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 1>living through interesting things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering good material,</v>

472
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after at least a year or so in</v>

473
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.300
<v Speaker 1>captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped hoping that I was going to get</v>

474
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:10.870
<v Speaker 1>out alive.</v>

475
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things were going so badly as far as the</v>

476
00:21:13.331 --> 00:21:16.420
<v Speaker 1>negotiation was concerned that I thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really the,</v>

477
00:21:16.421 --> 00:21:19.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm really in deep shit now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that standard for them to hold people</v>

478
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:21.790
<v Speaker 1>for that long?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

479
00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes and no.</v>

480
00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was held longer than any</v>

481
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:32.311
<v Speaker 1>westerner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the men on that ship didn't get out</v>

482
00:21:32.321 --> 00:21:36.010
<v Speaker 1>for an hour for a total of five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just under five years they were held.</v>

483
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they did get out.</v>

484
00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Eventually they did get out in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

485
00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And I was privileged enough to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nairobi and see them there.</v>

486
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I took him by surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

487
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.710
<v Speaker 1>So you flew out to meet them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

488
00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I was still living in Berlin and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>following the,</v>

489
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.180
<v Speaker 1>the case very closely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

490
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.940
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I helped raise some money.</v>

491
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.660
<v Speaker 1>The lawyers who were running it slow me</v>
<v Speaker 1>down there.</v>

492
00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was really nice.</v>

493
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:04.210
<v Speaker 1>And it was nice for the guys to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were obviously confused,</v>

494
00:22:04.211 --> 00:22:07.990
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing but very well meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but completely anonymous people around</v>

495
00:22:07.991 --> 00:22:08.824
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

496
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.550
<v Speaker 1>and then they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of came out of the terminal in</v>

497
00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Nairobi and they were still obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>still sort of a little bit confused and</v>

498
00:22:17.031 --> 00:22:19.270
<v Speaker 1>they're tapped one of them on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder and he recognized me and it was</v>

499
00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:20.760
<v Speaker 1>pandemonium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

500
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was wound up on Reuters video.</v>

501
00:22:23.771 --> 00:22:27.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it's available now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you eventually get fried?</v>

502
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

503
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.620
<v Speaker 1>So my mom raised a ransom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

504
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.280
<v Speaker 1>she raised it with help from family and</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and also some magazines.</v>

505
00:22:36.281 --> 00:22:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I'd worked for some institutions in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>US and in Germany.</v>

506
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:46.170
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she talked the pirates down to one</v>

507
00:22:47.141 --> 00:22:50.980
<v Speaker 1>point 6 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I got out for some reason at the</v>

508
00:22:50.981 --> 00:22:53.920
<v Speaker 1>very end the pirates came down</v>
<v Speaker 1>precipitously.</v>

509
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.120
<v Speaker 1>The very end after two years they</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding on for like,</v>

510
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I think they went down to four or $5</v>
<v Speaker 1>million or something like that.</v>

511
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:04.060
<v Speaker 1>And then at the very end that came down</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what was on offer.</v>

512
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:09.910
<v Speaker 1>No explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really accept that from my point of</v>

513
00:23:09.911 --> 00:23:10.744
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

514
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.830
<v Speaker 1>there were labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a labor unrest stirring among</v>

515
00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:16.030
<v Speaker 1>the guards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

516
00:23:16.031 --> 00:23:19.570
<v Speaker 1>the guards were sick of holding me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

517
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day towards the very end,</v>

518
00:23:22.811 --> 00:23:23.860
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

519
00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:26.140
<v Speaker 1>a few weeks before I got out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the guards actually said,</v>

520
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might go on strike like Detroit got,</v>

521
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.250
<v Speaker 1>do you need some help with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go on a hunger strike if you want.</v>

522
00:23:33.251 --> 00:23:35.740
<v Speaker 1>They're like slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow now.</v>

523
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.430
<v Speaker 1>There was one thing that I read were a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guarded left.</v>

524
00:23:39.431 --> 00:23:44.260
<v Speaker 1>You alone with a loaded rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened more than once.</v>

525
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.190
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the thought process there in your</v>

526
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:50.140
<v Speaker 1>mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

527
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:50.930
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

528
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:55.190
<v Speaker 1>especially after the first year or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And until how many guards you talking</v>

529
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:58.100
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about seven to 15 at any</v>

530
00:23:58.101 --> 00:24:00.090
<v Speaker 1>given point in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

531
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.070
<v Speaker 1>how many bullets are in the gun the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

532
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.000
<v Speaker 1>it was a Kalashnikov sis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A minimum of 16.</v>

533
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not enough.</v>

534
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

535
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.910
<v Speaker 1>and there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>

536
00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 1>there were always a few guards who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>asleep.</v>

537
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:20.210
<v Speaker 1>A few go to awake and so you go through</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing in your head,</v>

538
00:24:20.211 --> 00:24:21.044
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

539
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 1>I can grab the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can kill a few guys,</v>

540
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:29.890
<v Speaker 1>but it would be suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I went through various scenarios in</v>

541
00:24:30.861 --> 00:24:32.510
<v Speaker 1>my head all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

542
00:24:32.511 --> 00:24:34.970
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a very big temptation because</v>

543
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.370
<v Speaker 1>the guns just lay around like junk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

544
00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was,</v>

545
00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.530
<v Speaker 1>that was a dark period because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>question was not just can I blast my way</v>

546
00:24:45.531 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 1>out and live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also should I just take care of it,</v>

547
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:54.140
<v Speaker 1>right and kill myself now because I knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was causing a whole lot of</v>

548
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:57.740
<v Speaker 1>trouble for my family at home and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're probably military plans to come</v>

549
00:24:57.741 --> 00:25:00.410
<v Speaker 1>get me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would put seals at risk or a</v>

550
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:01.730
<v Speaker 1>special operators at risk.</v>

551
00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:06.790
<v Speaker 1>And so it's better to just check out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was on my mind often.</v>

552
00:25:08.121 --> 00:25:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Especially during the second year.</v>

553
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Were they sympathetic characters in any</v>
<v Speaker 2>way?</v>

554
00:25:14.001 --> 00:25:14.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you,</v>

555
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:19.670
<v Speaker 2>when you were around them for long</v>
<v Speaker 2>periods of time and you're taking into</v>

556
00:25:19.671 --> 00:25:22.550
<v Speaker 2>consideration this life that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>thrust upon them,</v>

557
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.840
<v Speaker 2>that this is the environment there grew</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in and this is the mean you,</v>

558
00:25:26.841 --> 00:25:29.990
<v Speaker 2>you had to have at least in some way</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten to know them?</v>

559
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went there thinking,</v>

560
00:25:31.611 --> 00:25:32.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

561
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell their stories somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

562
00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:36.810
<v Speaker 1>did you tell them that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

563
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.990
<v Speaker 1>But by the time I was captured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't matter.</v>

564
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:40.683
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

565
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.680
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they,</v>

566
00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:45.560
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones who wanted to talk</v>

567
00:25:45.561 --> 00:25:46.880
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they were sympathetic.</v>

568
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the poor people.</v>

569
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:54.110
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's not true that most pirates</v>

570
00:25:54.111 --> 00:25:57.440
<v Speaker 1>are frustrated fishermen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably only about 20 percent of them</v>

571
00:25:57.441 --> 00:25:58.360
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

572
00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.040
<v Speaker 1>all of them report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them need jobs and that's why</v>

573
00:26:01.041 --> 00:26:02.810
<v Speaker 1>they became pirates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

574
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.320
<v Speaker 1>you have to layer on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it caught habit is</v>

575
00:26:06.321 --> 00:26:09.680
<v Speaker 1>extremely ruinously expensive and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somalia,</v>

576
00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.170
<v Speaker 1>where does that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cut.</v>

577
00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Comes from highlands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it has to be grown in the mountains</v>

578
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:17.000
<v Speaker 1>of Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenya and flown in fresh.</v>

579
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be grown in a flat hot desert</v>

580
00:26:20.931 --> 00:26:22.190
<v Speaker 1>region like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Somalia,</v>

581
00:26:22.191 --> 00:26:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Yemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's where it's popular,</v>

582
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.060
<v Speaker 1>especially among Muslims who can't drink</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>

583
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.560
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

584
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this whole trade in that region</v>

585
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.950
<v Speaker 1>of the world and most of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time it's legal.</v>

586
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.220
<v Speaker 1>I think they only illegal illegalized it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Britain,</v>

587
00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:39.380
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2014.</v>

588
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.083
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

589
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's illegal here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

590
00:26:42.471 --> 00:26:43.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trade,</v>

591
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.210
<v Speaker 1>it just flows like water in that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula.</v>

592
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 1>So the voluntary coastguard of Somalia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we've been led to believe that this</v>

593
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:56.430
<v Speaker 1>is how it all started out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did that narrative get established?</v>

594
00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.060
<v Speaker 1>So once they started to capture big</v>
<v Speaker 1>ships,</v>

595
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:04.140
<v Speaker 1>they fell back on that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had been true up until then,</v>

596
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.750
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is defending our coastline from</v>

597
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.640
<v Speaker 1>fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it started that way.</v>

598
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.190
<v Speaker 1>So did that know that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

599
00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:12.120
<v Speaker 1>And the roots of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

600
00:27:12.121 --> 00:27:14.330
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'd heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'd heard is that it would,</v>

601
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.570
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it started because,</v>

602
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.050
<v Speaker 1>not just because people were fishing out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there because they were dumping toxic</v>

603
00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:20.160
<v Speaker 1>waste also.</v>

604
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.143
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

605
00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.770
<v Speaker 1>And that was also true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

606
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.200
<v Speaker 1>the Mafia was dumping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a,</v>

607
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.020
<v Speaker 1>had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mafia,</v>

608
00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:28.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>

609
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:33.270
<v Speaker 1>there were actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been sort of uncovered by Italian</v>

610
00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:36.930
<v Speaker 1>journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Italian mafia had found a way to</v>

611
00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:41.931
<v Speaker 1>bring waste for a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money down to someplace where they</v>

612
00:27:42.841 --> 00:27:44.980
<v Speaker 1>thought nobody would see it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

613
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:50.060
<v Speaker 1>and that some of it washed ashore in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2004 with the Indonesian tsunami that</v>

614
00:27:51.661 --> 00:27:54.420
<v Speaker 1>actually reached that part of East</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

615
00:27:55.730 --> 00:28:00.540
<v Speaker 1>So some of those big things that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italians dumped over the side of their</v>

616
00:28:00.541 --> 00:28:03.660
<v Speaker 1>boats wound up on the beach and Somalia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

617
00:28:03.661 --> 00:28:07.410
<v Speaker 1>so an actual physical vat or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can see what it was.</v>

618
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.030
<v Speaker 1>And I saw one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

619
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:09.923
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

620
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.480
<v Speaker 1>What was in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

621
00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:16.950
<v Speaker 1>but it was a great big sort of orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great big leg,</v>

622
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.360
<v Speaker 1>weirdly shaped cube.</v>

623
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.370
<v Speaker 1>How large?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A taller than me.</v>

624
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:25.490
<v Speaker 1>So at least eight feet square and it had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been used to contain some sort of toxic</v>

625
00:28:25.531 --> 00:28:27.300
<v Speaker 1>waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what my fixer told me.</v>

626
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:29.640
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had seen pictures,</v>

627
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.010
<v Speaker 1>similar pictures in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

628
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.920
<v Speaker 1>documentaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it was probably true,</v>

629
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.390
<v Speaker 1>it's described in the book just briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

630
00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the kind of thing that happened.</v>

631
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

632
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Italians were not,</v>

633
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:47.690
<v Speaker 1>or the mafia was not being very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

634
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.040
<v Speaker 1>they were being criminals too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

635
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.220
<v Speaker 1>that's the third business business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

636
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:58.580
<v Speaker 1>did you watch the Tom Hanks movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched 45 minutes at the Tom Hanks</v>

637
00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:02.220
<v Speaker 1>movie in Somalia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Somalia.</v>

638
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:03.570
<v Speaker 1>While you're captive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

639
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that like?</v>

640
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

641
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that I knew Captain Phillips was</v>

642
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:13.260
<v Speaker 1>going to be a movie when I left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was already clear,</v>

643
00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.190
<v Speaker 1>had already announced it or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had announced it when you left</v>

644
00:29:17.191 --> 00:29:19.920
<v Speaker 1>and you got to watch it when Somalia.</v>

645
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because by the time,</v>

646
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.800
<v Speaker 1>this is towards the end of my captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a shortwave radio,</v>

647
00:29:24.801 --> 00:29:28.440
<v Speaker 1>so I was listening to the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time it came out and went to the</v>

648
00:29:28.441 --> 00:29:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Oscars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all over the BBC.</v>

649
00:29:29.941 --> 00:29:31.350
<v Speaker 1>So I knew about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it was out.</v>

650
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:32.011
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

651
00:29:32.011 --> 00:29:34.130
<v Speaker 1>so I'm missing Captain Phillips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

652
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:39.150
<v Speaker 1>wonder what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one day all the guards got new</v>

653
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.350
<v Speaker 1>smartphones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty fancy,</v>

654
00:29:41.351 --> 00:29:43.420
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were apparently loaded with a</v>

655
00:29:43.421 --> 00:29:46.900
<v Speaker 1>new collection of films and music and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever to keep them occupied.</v>

656
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.830
<v Speaker 1>One afternoon I saw two guards just</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely wrapped by some sort of film</v>

657
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.440
<v Speaker 1>on the phone and I heard some American</v>
<v Speaker 1>voices.</v>

658
00:29:56.441 --> 00:29:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering what this film is.</v>

659
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.340
<v Speaker 1>And finally I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck me.</v>

660
00:30:00.341 --> 00:30:04.360
<v Speaker 1>That's Tom Hanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I knew what they were watching.</v>

661
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.490
<v Speaker 1>And two weeks later one of the guards</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

662
00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:08.710
<v Speaker 1>she handed me the phone and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

663
00:30:08.711 --> 00:30:09.544
<v Speaker 1>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>

664
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.730
<v Speaker 1>And so I saw about 45 minutes of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

665
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.260
<v Speaker 1>And of course when he handed me the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

666
00:30:14.261 --> 00:30:16.180
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that went through my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind is like,</v>

667
00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:17.110
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call mom,</v>

668
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.140
<v Speaker 1>just find a way to turn down the volume</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

669
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.270
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and call California.</v>

670
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.510
<v Speaker 1>He took the phone away before I did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

671
00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.510
<v Speaker 1>But I had a whole plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I developed a whole plan while I was</v>

672
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:29.740
<v Speaker 1>watching Captain Phillips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

673
00:30:29.741 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Speaker 1>get on the plane in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan or whatever.</v>

674
00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so atmospherically.</v>

675
00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:38.770
<v Speaker 1>It was a pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty well done movie,</v>

676
00:30:38.771 --> 00:30:40.810
<v Speaker 1>but there were a couple of scenes where</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>

677
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:42.220
<v Speaker 1>it just wouldn't have happened in real</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

678
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:43.840
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

679
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:45.820
<v Speaker 1>So what was inaccurate about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

680
00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:50.910
<v Speaker 1>there was one scene where there was some</v>
<v Speaker 1>selection of pirates on the beach,</v>

681
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.000
<v Speaker 1>so in public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

682
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:53.861
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

683
00:30:53.861 --> 00:30:54.730
<v Speaker 1>how did they get that?</v>

684
00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:55.540
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

685
00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I've never even heard of that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought about it and thought</v>

686
00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.560
<v Speaker 1>and realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

687
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.720
<v Speaker 1>that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually wouldn't happen like that in</v>

688
00:31:01.721 --> 00:31:03.940
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was just for dramatic purposes.</v>

689
00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

690
00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:08.440
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was invasive their material at first</v>

691
00:31:08.441 --> 00:31:09.730
<v Speaker 1>and then I realize now that I made that</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

692
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so things like that,</v>

693
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.450
<v Speaker 1>but the pirates were fascinated to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like them and in some cases</v>

694
00:31:16.451 --> 00:31:20.770
<v Speaker 1>they're friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm portrayed on screen and even though</v>

695
00:31:20.771 --> 00:31:21.900
<v Speaker 1>we all know how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

696
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.820
<v Speaker 1>the movie ends very badly for Somali</v>
<v Speaker 1>pirates.</v>

697
00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.270
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they knew about the story that was</v>

698
00:31:28.271 --> 00:31:29.104
<v Speaker 1>based on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

699
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.490
<v Speaker 1>no question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

700
00:31:30.491 --> 00:31:34.210
<v Speaker 1>but one of them said that he was friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>with one of the pirates involved and I</v>

701
00:31:34.211 --> 00:31:37.780
<v Speaker 1>believe him actually he had the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>clan affiliation for that.</v>

702
00:31:37.781 --> 00:31:39.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite possible.</v>

703
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:44.640
<v Speaker 1>What was it like to see them watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>their story being depicted on the other</v>

704
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:45.700
<v Speaker 1>side of the planet?</v>

705
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what was weird is that they,</v>

706
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.590
<v Speaker 1>they were so fascinated by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

707
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:54.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise they didn't necessarily like</v>

708
00:31:54.101 --> 00:31:57.430
<v Speaker 1>to talk about bad news for pirates or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

709
00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.300
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the hostages were released,</v>

710
00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or rescued in the first few days of my</v>

711
00:32:04.031 --> 00:32:05.650
<v Speaker 1>captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

712
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I kept hearing that the hostages had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been killed.</v>

713
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:13.010
<v Speaker 1>So they like to spin things in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a good way for,</v>

714
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:14.690
<v Speaker 1>for pirates in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

715
00:32:14.691 --> 00:32:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I just would have assumed they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>just ignore captain phillips because it</v>

716
00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.500
<v Speaker 1>been so badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just fascinated.</v>

717
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.310
<v Speaker 1>They really were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what was daily life like for you?</v>

718
00:32:24.311 --> 00:32:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ate with them?</v>

719
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I separately,</v>

720
00:32:28.001 --> 00:32:33.001
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes in the same room they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made very bad food,</v>

721
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.140
<v Speaker 1>boiled beans and flavorless boiled goat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that kind of thing.</v>

722
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they would eat from a communal</v>

723
00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:47.280
<v Speaker 1>platter is sort of elsewhere within</v>
<v Speaker 1>sight.</v>

724
00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to eat from the same</v>

725
00:32:48.981 --> 00:32:52.280
<v Speaker 1>platter as they eat by hand by hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

726
00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very common in that part of the</v>

727
00:32:55.341 --> 00:32:56.091
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

728
00:32:56.091 --> 00:32:57.920
<v Speaker 1>it really is because utensils just</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't,</v>

729
00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.840
<v Speaker 1>aren't that common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they really liked spaghetti so they</v>

730
00:33:00.841 --> 00:33:02.630
<v Speaker 1>sort of wrap the spaghetti around your</v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers.</v>

731
00:33:02.631 --> 00:33:04.430
<v Speaker 1>And I had done that as a free man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

732
00:33:04.431 --> 00:33:07.910
<v Speaker 1>I sort of sat with Somalis in and eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

733
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.530
<v Speaker 1>But as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a hostage,</v>

734
00:33:09.531 --> 00:33:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I was in no mood to be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

735
00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:13.860
<v Speaker 1>that friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

736
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.250
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave me a fork and I could eat my</v>

737
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:19.370
<v Speaker 1>on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how,</v>

738
00:33:19.371 --> 00:33:22.640
<v Speaker 1>like what kind of physical state were</v>
<v Speaker 1>you in after two and a half years of</v>

739
00:33:22.641 --> 00:33:23.090
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

740
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.040
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was my,</v>

741
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my immune system,</v>

742
00:33:27.141 --> 00:33:30.800
<v Speaker 1>it started to fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't go into detail too much about</v>

743
00:33:30.801 --> 00:33:35.510
<v Speaker 1>this in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had a staph infection and my skin</v>

744
00:33:35.511 --> 00:33:39.740
<v Speaker 1>and some other kind of infection in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>ear and I was just something in my</v>

745
00:33:39.741 --> 00:33:40.190
<v Speaker 1>lungs.</v>

746
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.200
<v Speaker 1>I was just not very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sick,</v>

747
00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was sick constantly for several</v>

748
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.660
<v Speaker 1>months before I got out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I knew something had really changed</v>

749
00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.930
<v Speaker 1>and I think the pirates were aware of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that too slowly.</v>

750
00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that probably possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>contributed to them lowering your ransom</v>

751
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.050
<v Speaker 1>possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

752
00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:59.030
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

753
00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.180
<v Speaker 1>not that they were sympathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

754
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:04.520
<v Speaker 1>it's possible they saw me sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaching,</v>

755
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.830
<v Speaker 1>reaching my physical limit slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

756
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a for.</v>

757
00:34:09.891 --> 00:34:11.720
<v Speaker 1>It's actually can get you pretty quickly</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

758
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they wound up just being that,</v>

759
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.470
<v Speaker 1>but it was raising boils on my skin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew about that.</v>

760
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:22.010
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not that long ago.</v>

761
00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 12 to 2014 was when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

762
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:27.470
<v Speaker 1>when that was released and had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>infection.</v>

763
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean four years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing.</v>

764
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Pushing four years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

765
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.730
<v Speaker 1>what does it feel like now to be free to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

766
00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you still have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

767
00:34:38.541 --> 00:34:41.990
<v Speaker 1>have ptsd from it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you get um,</v>

768
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.430
<v Speaker 1>well now I can be happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the day I was released I was</v>

769
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.760
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt better in stages,</v>

770
00:34:49.761 --> 00:34:53.190
<v Speaker 1>but w it wasn't sudden euphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

771
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.830
<v Speaker 1>now I can be really be happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took me about a year to get back to</v>

772
00:34:57.831 --> 00:35:02.831
<v Speaker 1>full strength and the symptoms of Ptsd</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I showed when I first got out,</v>

773
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:07.100
<v Speaker 1>which included like hyper hyper</v>
<v Speaker 1>vigilance.</v>

774
00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:12.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm went away slowly as I got physically</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong hypervigilance being like wake up</v>

775
00:35:12.441 --> 00:35:14.730
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nightmares that will,</v>

776
00:35:14.731 --> 00:35:18.080
<v Speaker 1>that nightmares only happened within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first year.</v>

777
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm waking up in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

778
00:35:20.421 --> 00:35:22.160
<v Speaker 1>That still happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still don't sleep too well.</v>

779
00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Hypervigilance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean out in public,</v>

780
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.860
<v Speaker 1>too many people around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

781
00:35:27.861 --> 00:35:28.850
<v Speaker 1>like you hear with vets.</v>

782
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was aware of that as a symptom and</v>

783
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:35.060
<v Speaker 1>I felt at first when we were out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>public in Nairobi and I turned to the</v>

784
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:37.470
<v Speaker 1>FBI psychologist who was with me and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

785
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:39.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I hypervigilant?</v>

786
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.460
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

787
00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you here because you know,</v>

788
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I might have ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

789
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.880
<v Speaker 1>we don't like to put a label on</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

790
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:52.050
<v Speaker 1>And that was his attitude towards me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the attack he took.</v>

791
00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.860
<v Speaker 1>And in my case at least it was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually he said,</v>

792
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.530
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't I be treated for PTSD or</v>

793
00:35:58.531 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't I be going to regular talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy or something like that.</v>

794
00:36:00.841 --> 00:36:01.920
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

795
00:36:01.921 --> 00:36:04.650
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to pathologize anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

796
00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:07.710
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to create mentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>another condition for you,</v>

797
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.540
<v Speaker 1>for you to recover from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

798
00:36:09.541 --> 00:36:12.930
<v Speaker 1>it's enough work for your mind and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body to recover quite naturally.</v>

799
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:16.620
<v Speaker 1>They know how to do it from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that trauma.</v>

800
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:20.040
<v Speaker 1>That's very interesting because I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard people talk about that with other</v>

801
00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:21.870
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly with war,</v>

802
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:26.310
<v Speaker 1>that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're better off not deciding what you</v>

803
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:30.360
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not being told what you have in my</v>

804
00:36:30.361 --> 00:36:31.194
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

805
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

806
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.920
<v Speaker 1>I think ptsd can be so complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

807
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pharmaceutical solutions in that</v>

808
00:36:38.011 --> 00:36:41.880
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body of my know how to recover.</v>

809
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:44.010
<v Speaker 1>So you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to let them.</v>

810
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Do they give you techniques to recover</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in instead of explaining or</v>

811
00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:54.420
<v Speaker 1>discussing what the issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they give you techniques to feel</v>

812
00:36:54.421 --> 00:36:58.560
<v Speaker 1>better or to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to establish more normal existence?</v>

813
00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I know I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

814
00:37:00.011 --> 00:37:02.870
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get a checklist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the psychologist would say,</v>

815
00:37:02.871 --> 00:37:03.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something's bothering you,</v>

816
00:37:03.961 --> 00:37:04.970
<v Speaker 1>write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

817
00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:06.450
<v Speaker 1>but he knew I was a writer.</v>

818
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.820
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made sure they knew that I had a</v>

819
00:37:10.821 --> 00:37:14.670
<v Speaker 1>loving family around me when I got back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a great circle of friends in Berlin.</v>

820
00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really important.</v>

821
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody finds their own way.</v>

822
00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was weak.</v>

823
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just physical,</v>

824
00:37:23.461 --> 00:37:24.380
<v Speaker 1>like a race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

825
00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.580
<v Speaker 1>when I got out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much weight did you lose?</v>

826
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:30.440
<v Speaker 1>I lost about 40 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

827
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:34.260
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first came out and walked around</v>

828
00:37:34.261 --> 00:37:35.790
<v Speaker 1>in Berlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Berlin's a walking city,</v>

829
00:37:35.791 --> 00:37:39.330
<v Speaker 1>so I tried to lead like normal day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

830
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:43.830
<v Speaker 1>my knees swelled up in my ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swelled up and they were really painful.</v>

831
00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.250
<v Speaker 1>So it was like I just played a game of</v>
<v Speaker 1>football or something.</v>

832
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.580
<v Speaker 1>You weren't moving while you were there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

833
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:50.940
<v Speaker 1>not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did yoga,</v>

834
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.080
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't go for a jog around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>room or something like you sometimes</v>

835
00:37:55.081 --> 00:37:56.070
<v Speaker 1>hear for prisoners.</v>

836
00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:58.410
<v Speaker 1>And if I'd done that I think they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been social to startle the,</v>

837
00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.240
<v Speaker 1>they would've shot me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

838
00:38:00.241 --> 00:38:05.241
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not in any kind of shape for,</v>

839
00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.410
<v Speaker 1>for normal life when I got out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact one day when I got back from</v>

840
00:38:10.411 --> 00:38:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Berlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to run for a street car.</v>

841
00:38:11.941 --> 00:38:13.950
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't have the musculature for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

842
00:38:13.951 --> 00:38:17.200
<v Speaker 1>I simply didn't have a stride to run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not run well,</v>

843
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

844
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:22.560
<v Speaker 1>but one of the doctors who tested me</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

845
00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:24.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a protein deficiency.</v>

846
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:30.030
<v Speaker 1>And once I started to take care of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I went consciously to the gym and</v>

847
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.670
<v Speaker 1>made sure I got stronger and also put on</v>
<v Speaker 1>more muscle.</v>

848
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mental things sort of took care of</v>

849
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.930
<v Speaker 1>themselves too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that body mind connection was</v>

850
00:38:37.931 --> 00:38:38.764
<v Speaker 1>really important</v>

851
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 2>and when they're telling you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have a protein deficiency that</v>

852
00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:44.770
<v Speaker 2>you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

853
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:47.560
<v Speaker 2>you should exercise and take care of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

854
00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:53.140
<v Speaker 2>And this is improving is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they giving you guidelines like this</v>

855
00:38:53.141 --> 00:38:55.780
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is probably a good idea to try to</v>

856
00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.580
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

857
00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.400
<v Speaker 2>are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there any strategies that people</v>

858
00:39:00.401 --> 00:39:04.630
<v Speaker 2>have to deal with coming out of long</v>
<v Speaker 2>term incarceration?</v>

859
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not specific ones.</v>

860
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it was clear to everyone that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was easily overwhelmed.</v>

861
00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:11.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

862
00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one point my family sat down with me</v>

863
00:39:15.261 --> 00:39:18.350
<v Speaker 1>with all the paperwork that had to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken care of and I could only deal with</v>

864
00:39:18.351 --> 00:39:20.780
<v Speaker 1>that for like an hour at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

865
00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:22.880
<v Speaker 1>and the debrief paperwork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

866
00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:27.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm bank things to sign and that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

867
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how so?</v>

868
00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just let,</v>

869
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:33.230
<v Speaker 1>all my affairs were in somebody else's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands when I was for the two and a half</v>

870
00:39:33.231 --> 00:39:34.280
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two and a half years.</v>

871
00:39:34.281 --> 00:39:36.710
<v Speaker 1>And so we had to sort of rectify a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

872
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

873
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't plow through it and then an</v>
<v Speaker 1>afternoon or in a week I had to do it in</v>

874
00:39:41.841 --> 00:39:45.770
<v Speaker 1>stages and it was the same thing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a debriefing with the FBI,</v>

875
00:39:45.771 --> 00:39:49.280
<v Speaker 1>which I did for three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't always do it for the entire</v>

876
00:39:49.281 --> 00:39:50.150
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happen?</v>

877
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:54.350
<v Speaker 1>My brain would like to actually seize</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

878
00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean I actually would just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

879
00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:00.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean you said earlier when I talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

880
00:40:00.951 --> 00:40:04.520
<v Speaker 1>I go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My whole body would like constrict and I</v>

881
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:07.610
<v Speaker 1>would simply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of me would just shut down.</v>

882
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:08.390
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

883
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:11.270
<v Speaker 1>you've leveled off now physically like</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shoulders,</v>

884
00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:14.000
<v Speaker 1>but I'm looking at you right now from</v>
<v Speaker 1>our conversation.</v>

885
00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:14.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't feel</v>

886
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:17.590
<v Speaker 2>when you started talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your shoulders,</v>

887
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.920
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like started to almost visibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>rise up</v>

888
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.070
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

889
00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:27.150
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying when I first got out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must have been much more exact cause</v>

890
00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:28.070
<v Speaker 1>paralytic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

891
00:40:28.071 --> 00:40:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

892
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.470
<v Speaker 1>something inside me just shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

893
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.050
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

894
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:35.340
<v Speaker 1>it just wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

895
00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:38.840
<v Speaker 1>You just didn't have the capacity to sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and concentrate on anything.</v>

896
00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:42.440
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't concentration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a sense of overwhelm.</v>

897
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

898
00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.200
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on too many things at</v>
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>

899
00:40:45.201 --> 00:40:48.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it was also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was also overwhelmed by too many</v>

900
00:40:48.291 --> 00:40:49.020
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

901
00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:52.010
<v Speaker 1>too many people in the room because too</v>
<v Speaker 1>many social cues to read.</v>

902
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.340
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have that with the pirates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was real clear.</v>

903
00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I was the hostage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were the guards in some sense we</v>

904
00:40:59.271 --> 00:41:03.260
<v Speaker 1>were enemies and that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we had real simple things to say to</v>

905
00:41:03.261 --> 00:41:05.420
<v Speaker 1>each other and that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was my life for,</v>

906
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.190
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of years after the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

907
00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.770
<v Speaker 1>after the ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not complex.</v>

908
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:14.690
<v Speaker 1>And so when I got out the complexities</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a more comfortable life,</v>

909
00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:15.970
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

910
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:19.190
<v Speaker 1>more elaborate life were really</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

911
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.320
<v Speaker 1>You're obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were aware of the time that you were</v>

912
00:41:21.321 --> 00:41:23.720
<v Speaker 1>struggling with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were aware that it was difficult,</v>

913
00:41:23.721 --> 00:41:26.990
<v Speaker 1>real clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what were you confused by that</v>

914
00:41:26.991 --> 00:41:27.824
<v Speaker 1>difficulty?</v>

915
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:30.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not confused.</v>

916
00:41:30.771 --> 00:41:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't sure how it was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>recover,</v>

917
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:35.060
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew to take it slow and taking it</v>

918
00:41:35.061 --> 00:41:37.090
<v Speaker 1>slow as important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

919
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:40.470
<v Speaker 1>How did you ultimately recover the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

920
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:42.080
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day at a time like that.</v>

921
00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:44.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've consciously got better</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically.</v>

922
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to consciously did yoga and</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to,</v>

923
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:49.450
<v Speaker 1>went to the gym consciously eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well My,</v>

924
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:52.220
<v Speaker 1>my um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my doctor said don't follow a vegetarian</v>

925
00:41:52.221 --> 00:41:56.180
<v Speaker 1>diet but eat a full diet and make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get enough protein.</v>

926
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Why not have a vegetarian diet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need protein,</v>

927
00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:01.200
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a lot of protein,</v>

928
00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.930
<v Speaker 1>animal protein specifically</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

929
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:10.720
<v Speaker 2>what is your situation now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that you said you still,</v>

930
00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:15.780
<v Speaker 2>you still have a hard time sleeping and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it a nightmare issue or is it an</v>

931
00:42:16.871 --> 00:42:18.160
<v Speaker 2>anxiety issue?</v>

932
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:19.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not nightmares,</v>

933
00:42:19.201 --> 00:42:22.620
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason when it gets so in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somalia,</v>

934
00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.850
<v Speaker 1>when it came time to go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least for a long period,</v>

935
00:42:26.851 --> 00:42:30.930
<v Speaker 1>they would chain up my feet and I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to lie on a mattress under a</v>

936
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:33.780
<v Speaker 1>mosquito net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was it for 12 hours.</v>

937
00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.260
<v Speaker 1>So now when it comes time to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

938
00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:41.760
<v Speaker 1>instead of tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get anxious and then it's possible</v>

939
00:42:41.761 --> 00:42:43.260
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might wake up,</v>

940
00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully awake after only four hours.</v>

941
00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:48.480
<v Speaker 1>So I take Melatonin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing,</v>

942
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.510
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't take hard drugs to sleep,</v>

943
00:42:51.511 --> 00:42:54.210
<v Speaker 1>but I take a little assistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

944
00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:55.523
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

945
00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Now this book that you wrote of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>desert in the sea,</v>

946
00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:02.760
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how difficult was it to sit down in</v>

947
00:43:02.761 --> 00:43:07.320
<v Speaker 2>front of a computer and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>recapture these thoughts</v>

948
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.410
<v Speaker 1>and transcribe them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

949
00:43:09.411 --> 00:43:11.720
<v Speaker 1>they're well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was also sort of blood and</v>

950
00:43:11.721 --> 00:43:15.080
<v Speaker 1>sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The research was blood,</v>

951
00:43:15.081 --> 00:43:16.880
<v Speaker 1>sweat and tears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was the writing.</v>

952
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:22.360
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did know at least this the facts of</v>

953
00:43:22.461 --> 00:43:26.270
<v Speaker 1>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I put those down first and then we</v>

954
00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:31.271
<v Speaker 1>went back and did how it felt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the putting everything down,</v>

955
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:32.960
<v Speaker 1>which a writer likes to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

956
00:43:32.961 --> 00:43:36.650
<v Speaker 1>all at once in one sort of great active</v>
<v Speaker 1>creation,</v>

957
00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:37.683
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

958
00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.050
<v Speaker 1>that would have been a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming.</v>

959
00:43:39.051 --> 00:43:41.960
<v Speaker 1>So I did it in layers and that was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to go.</v>

960
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:47.120
<v Speaker 1>What were you like before this and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you like now and what's different?</v>

961
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I think my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my basic self is the same,</v>

962
00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.450
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

963
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm more patient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

964
00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm more grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just getting out alive,</v>

965
00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:02.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made me certainly grateful to be around.</v>

966
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.970
<v Speaker 1>It was great to see my family and</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends again and if I ever start to</v>

967
00:44:07.971 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 1>feel ungrateful for something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this well of memory that can go</v>

968
00:44:11.871 --> 00:44:14.630
<v Speaker 1>back to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's essential.</v>

969
00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think in Somalia I also learned to</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgive,</v>

970
00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:19.930
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

971
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:23.930
<v Speaker 1>not an easy process and it's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's something very</v>

972
00:44:23.931 --> 00:44:26.870
<v Speaker 1>essential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How so how'd you learn to forgive?</v>

973
00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we talked about picking up a</v>

974
00:44:29.581 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Kalashnikov.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to do that.</v>

975
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I thought about doing that and it was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>internal debate for really long time</v>

976
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:41.640
<v Speaker 1>until one point where I'm actually heard</v>
<v Speaker 1>something on the radio from the pope,</v>

977
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:46.790
<v Speaker 1>the new pope I'd never even seen before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he gave a very good homily about</v>

978
00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:51.930
<v Speaker 1>what forgiveness meant and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>resonated and at some point I made a</v>

979
00:44:51.931 --> 00:44:54.540
<v Speaker 1>conscious decision to forgive the guards</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were around me,</v>

980
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:56.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the lowest lowest ranking</v>

981
00:44:56.881 --> 00:44:59.010
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were making my life miserable</v>

982
00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:04.610
<v Speaker 1>and I made a conscious decision to</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgive them and I had to do that over</v>

983
00:45:05.251 --> 00:45:08.760
<v Speaker 1>and over and that made my mind a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot more,</v>

984
00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:14.010
<v Speaker 1>more stable and suddenly settled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that unless I had done that,</v>

985
00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I probably would have picked up a gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>and killed myself,</v>

986
00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:18.240
<v Speaker 1>if not them or both.</v>

987
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:24.270
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating that a speech by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pope could resonate so strongly with you</v>

988
00:45:24.271 --> 00:45:28.320
<v Speaker 1>while you were in captivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just forgiveness.</v>

989
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Forgiveness wouldn't have had to be by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pope,</v>

990
00:45:31.021 --> 00:45:32.130
<v Speaker 1>but he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was pretty good.</v>

991
00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:36.650
<v Speaker 1>That's something that people play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay lip service to and you know,</v>

992
00:45:36.651 --> 00:45:39.380
<v Speaker 1>you hear people saying you should live a</v>
<v Speaker 1>life of forgiveness.</v>

993
00:45:39.381 --> 00:45:43.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's healthier for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one can really understand that</v>

994
00:45:43.341 --> 00:45:45.520
<v Speaker 1>the way you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me it was life and death.</v>

995
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

996
00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:50.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to read your book.</v>

997
00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:56.190
<v Speaker 1>It is a crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doesn't mean.</v>

998
00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:01.490
<v Speaker 1>It's just such an insane experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that your,</v>

999
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:07.030
<v Speaker 1>your just your well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of experiences like what you can draw</v>

1000
00:46:07.791 --> 00:46:11.440
<v Speaker 1>upon is so different from most people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're interacting with you.</v>

1001
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:15.890
<v Speaker 1>It must almost feel like you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>through life interacting with privileged</v>

1002
00:46:15.891 --> 00:46:17.900
<v Speaker 1>children sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>

1003
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.500
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very happy to be back in.</v>

1004
00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the world I grew up in.</v>

1005
00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.910
<v Speaker 1>So that's the main thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1006
00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.140
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes up.</v>

1007
00:46:27.141 --> 00:46:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people complain about things,</v>

1008
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:31.440
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1009
00:46:31.441 --> 00:46:32.900
<v Speaker 1>it's so fucking Horny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1010
00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should try hot in Somalia prison</v>

1011
00:46:37.371 --> 00:46:38.980
<v Speaker 1>where you're shackled to a bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1012
00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1013
00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:43.920
<v Speaker 1>We're idiots and traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a much more patient drive and so is</v>

1014
00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.220
<v Speaker 1>my mother by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1015
00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so happy to get her son,</v>

1016
00:46:47.241 --> 00:46:48.450
<v Speaker 1>but right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1017
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:50.960
<v Speaker 1>She's the heroine of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she really,</v>

1018
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:52.400
<v Speaker 1>she really took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1019
00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:56.030
<v Speaker 1>the</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous amount.</v>

1020
00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:58.100
<v Speaker 1>So is it like to see her after two</v>
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

1021
00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.140
<v Speaker 1>It was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1022
00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was obviously she was on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and all my friends and family were</v>

1023
00:47:03.501 --> 00:47:06.890
<v Speaker 1>on my mind while I was in Somalia and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to see somebody that I'd been</v>

1024
00:47:06.891 --> 00:47:09.440
<v Speaker 1>thinking about all this time and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of hypothetical way,</v>

1025
00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:13.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again in real life and the way that I</v>

1026
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:16.650
<v Speaker 1>really thought I wouldn't was</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming.</v>

1027
00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.570
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fantastic.</v>

1028
00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Now had you gone to dangerous places for</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalism before Somalia?</v>

1029
00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Where did you go on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1030
00:47:26.391 --> 00:47:28.910
<v Speaker 1>so for my second book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweeten some.</v>

1031
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:31.820
<v Speaker 1>I surfed in Gaza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1032
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd been to northern Iraq and some</v>

1033
00:47:34.811 --> 00:47:37.810
<v Speaker 1>other places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this was easily the most dangerous</v>

1034
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.460
<v Speaker 1>thing you do in Gaza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1035
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:43.330
<v Speaker 1>W I went to see the Gaza Surf Club and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually went surfing with them.</v>

1036
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:46.210
<v Speaker 1>The Gaza Surf Club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This exists.</v>

1037
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

1038
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a group of Palestinians who</v>

1039
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:53.640
<v Speaker 1>liked to surf but who don't have enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>surfboards.</v>

1040
00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:57.820
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they organized into a club first to</v>

1041
00:47:57.821 --> 00:48:00.640
<v Speaker 1>share a couple of surf boards that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had found.</v>

1042
00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:03.400
<v Speaker 1>And managed to manage to buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1043
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:07.450
<v Speaker 1>and also to receive donations from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of surfers and Tel Aviv who</v>

1044
00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:11.230
<v Speaker 1>thought these guys should have boards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a relationship.</v>

1045
00:48:11.231 --> 00:48:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Grew up between a group in Tel Aviv</v>
<v Speaker 1>called surfing for peace and the Gaza</v>

1046
00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Surf Club.</v>

1047
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:20.970
<v Speaker 1>So Jews in Tel Aviv or donating</v>
<v Speaker 1>surfboards to Palestinians.</v>

1048
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely wonderful.</v>

1049
00:48:23.351 --> 00:48:26.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a grassroots peace initiative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1050
00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:30.910
<v Speaker 1>it's been going on for years now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm one of the eloquent things that</v>

1051
00:48:30.911 --> 00:48:32.370
<v Speaker 1>the leader of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1052
00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:36.460
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the surfing for pease group said was</v>

1053
00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.340
<v Speaker 1>we're not getting anywhere on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>official level so we better do something</v>

1054
00:48:39.341 --> 00:48:42.070
<v Speaker 1>on sort of a grassroots level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's marvelous.</v>

1055
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1056
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.030
<v Speaker 1>what do you do now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1057
00:48:46.031 --> 00:48:49.300
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So seeking out danger was never the</v>

1058
00:48:49.301 --> 00:48:50.110
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1059
00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:52.480
<v Speaker 1>I tried not to shrink from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was not,</v>

1060
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:54.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a thrill seeker and that's not</v>

1061
00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:57.550
<v Speaker 1>the what I'm trying to base my career on</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that.</v>

1062
00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now I'm writing a novel,</v>

1063
00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:04.540
<v Speaker 1>so that should keep me seated for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it about a two bedrooms,</v>

1064
00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:05.943
<v Speaker 1>drones.</v>

1065
00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:13.410
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't sound peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what I'm not gonna say anymore</v>

1066
00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:14.643
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1067
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1068
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:20.250
<v Speaker 1>do you ever anticipate yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling for journals and began?</v>

1069
00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel.</v>

1070
00:49:21.461 --> 00:49:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just nothing like this.</v>

1071
00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1072
00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:27.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to do dangerous travel</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime soon.</v>

1073
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:28.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1074
00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people just want to jump right back</v>

1075
00:49:31.061 --> 00:49:32.590
<v Speaker 1>into the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1076
00:49:32.591 --> 00:49:35.110
<v Speaker 1>that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was not the point in the first</v>

1077
00:49:35.111 --> 00:49:36.010
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1078
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.920
<v Speaker 1>What was the point like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you hope to get out of this</v>

1079
00:49:38.921 --> 00:49:40.180
<v Speaker 1>trip to Somalia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1080
00:49:40.181 --> 00:49:43.240
<v Speaker 1>so when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that I noticed while I was</v>

1081
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.820
<v Speaker 1>watching the trial and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1082
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:50.320
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Hamburg was this clash between a</v>

1083
00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.420
<v Speaker 1>modern liberal state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what Germany is.</v>

1084
00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.300
<v Speaker 1>And so it was America by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1085
00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:00.840
<v Speaker 1>and in our case at crime and Germany in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact is newer than the United States in</v>

1086
00:50:02.921 --> 00:50:06.370
<v Speaker 1>the sense that its constitution was</v>
<v Speaker 1>written in 1949 when nobody was thinking</v>

1087
00:50:06.371 --> 00:50:07.204
<v Speaker 1>about piracy.</v>

1088
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:10.430
<v Speaker 1>So the laws against piracy or extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>lenient in,</v>

1089
00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:13.480
<v Speaker 1>in German law in a way that they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish or American law,</v>

1090
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:16.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have laws that date back to when it</v>

1091
00:50:16.631 --> 00:50:20.620
<v Speaker 1>was a capital crime</v>
<v Speaker 1>and basically the Germans didn't know</v>

1092
00:50:20.621 --> 00:50:24.130
<v Speaker 1>how to deal with these guys and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was fascinating in the</v>

1093
00:50:24.131 --> 00:50:28.910
<v Speaker 1>first place that this ancient crime had</v>
<v Speaker 1>revived after a couple of centuries of</v>

1094
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:30.230
<v Speaker 1>relative quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1095
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:34.790
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that tension on its own was</v>

1096
00:50:34.791 --> 00:50:37.850
<v Speaker 1>interesting and that was worth a book</v>
<v Speaker 1>because nobody was quite approaching it</v>

1097
00:50:37.851 --> 00:50:39.020
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1098
00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that tension is still interesting and</v>

1099
00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:46.760
<v Speaker 1>that tension is still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's certainly threats to modern</v>

1100
00:50:46.761 --> 00:50:48.350
<v Speaker 1>liberal states going on around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1101
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:50.960
<v Speaker 1>So what were the trials in Berlin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1102
00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:54.410
<v Speaker 1>there was a trial in Hamburg and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back and forth from Berlin.</v>

1103
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:59.800
<v Speaker 1>It was 10 guys from Somalia who I tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hijack a cargo ship that belonged to</v>

1104
00:51:00.441 --> 00:51:01.580
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1105
00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:06.640
<v Speaker 1>a German ship ship company that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>based in Hamburg A.</v>

1106
00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.710
<v Speaker 1>I think they were overpowered by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch navy,</v>

1107
00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.900
<v Speaker 1>but the Dutch handed him over to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans.</v>

1108
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:14.120
<v Speaker 1>In fact the Dutch said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1109
00:51:14.121 --> 00:51:17.720
<v Speaker 1>we'll do this as long as we don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try them because everyone knew from</v>

1110
00:51:17.721 --> 00:51:20.570
<v Speaker 1>the outset that there was going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1111
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying Somalis will.</v>

1112
00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.610
<v Speaker 1>In what way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1113
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.210
<v Speaker 1>in Europe in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but especially in Germany,</v>

1114
00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:34.211
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a actually a law against</v>
<v Speaker 1>shipping them back to Somalia because</v>

1115
00:51:34.431 --> 00:51:37.240
<v Speaker 1>it's considered not a safe place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1116
00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.200
<v Speaker 1>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them,</v>

1117
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:40.920
<v Speaker 1>even for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's nuts.</v>

1118
00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Once they were convicted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they should have been deported</v>

1119
00:51:43.131 --> 00:51:45.350
<v Speaker 1>after they served their time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so bizarre.</v>

1120
00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:47.330
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they were shipped back to</v>

1121
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:48.770
<v Speaker 1>Somalia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would they be treated?</v>

1122
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the government like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somalia?</v>

1123
00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:53.570
<v Speaker 1>And good question sanely corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked some of my parents about that.</v>

1124
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:55.630
<v Speaker 1>It is corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1125
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:57.770
<v Speaker 1>it's either corrupt or nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

1126
00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:02.360
<v Speaker 1>the government is Somalia are focused</v>
<v Speaker 1>around Mogadishu and it just doesn't</v>

1127
00:52:02.361 --> 00:52:04.760
<v Speaker 1>have that much power in the provinces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was in one of the,</v>

1128
00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:09.050
<v Speaker 1>one of the provinces and because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>provinces don't get a whole lot of money</v>

1129
00:52:09.051 --> 00:52:11.360
<v Speaker 1>from Mogadishu so that they run their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own businesses,</v>

1130
00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:13.490
<v Speaker 1>wins in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piracy.</v>

1131
00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked one of my guards what would</v>

1132
00:52:16.641 --> 00:52:21.641
<v Speaker 1>happen if a pirate went and got thrown</v>
<v Speaker 1>into jail and some of the country and</v>

1133
00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:24.370
<v Speaker 1>then came back and tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1134
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.560
<v Speaker 1>set up friendships again with his old</v>
<v Speaker 1>pirate buddies or whatever,</v>

1135
00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:29.420
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would he be killed?</v>

1136
00:52:29.421 --> 00:52:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Who would he be in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in dangerous?</v>

1137
00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:31.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1138
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:34.460
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably what you were back in.</v>

1139
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:36.790
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1140
00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:37.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1141
00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:42.930
<v Speaker 1>is there any sort of punishment for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them when they get back to Somalia?</v>

1142
00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Was there any penal system or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially there is.</v>

1143
00:52:46.491 --> 00:52:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're not considered a crime?</v>

1144
00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:49.550
<v Speaker 1>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1145
00:52:49.551 --> 00:52:50.440
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>

1146
00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:54.680
<v Speaker 1>there are laws on the books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the regions and even</v>

1147
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:56.640
<v Speaker 1>prisons for pirates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1148
00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.920
<v Speaker 1>the problem is that clan relationships</v>
<v Speaker 1>are a lot more important than newly</v>

1149
00:53:00.921 --> 00:53:02.280
<v Speaker 1>written laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1150
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:06.170
<v Speaker 1>and so even prior to go to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was true about one boss.</v>

1151
00:53:06.171 --> 00:53:08.240
<v Speaker 1>In my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm might cut out again.</v>

1152
00:53:08.241 --> 00:53:10.620
<v Speaker 1>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy who was a pirate Boston,</v>

1153
00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:14.990
<v Speaker 1>my case wound up in jail while I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>still captive for one month in Mogadishu</v>

1154
00:53:14.991 --> 00:53:17.600
<v Speaker 1>and wound up walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1155
00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was captive for piracy I think</v>

1156
00:53:21.891 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 1>for having weapons that the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't expect to see in one of his</v>

1157
00:53:26.101 --> 00:53:26.934
<v Speaker 1>houses.</v>

1158
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:32.870
<v Speaker 1>So a is something off to the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's this really sketchy system of</v>

1159
00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:37.520
<v Speaker 1>bartering and payoffs and let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1160
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:39.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who you're related to.</v>

1161
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.970
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other prisons for,</v>

1162
00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:44.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low ranking pirates and Puntland and</v>

1163
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:47.960
<v Speaker 1>also in Galkayo where I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1164
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:50.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a crap shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much time those guys are going to</v>

1165
00:53:50.551 --> 00:53:53.970
<v Speaker 1>spend in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happened with the people in</v>

1166
00:53:53.971 --> 00:53:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got a total of seven years I think,</v>

1167
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:01.020
<v Speaker 1>or an average in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Germany.</v>

1168
00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:03.150
<v Speaker 1>And then what happened when they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>released?</v>

1169
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1170
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole separate story,</v>

1171
00:54:07.951 --> 00:54:11.190
<v Speaker 1>which I haven't even started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Started to address,</v>

1172
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.800
<v Speaker 1>but as it turned out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few of them went back to Somalia.</v>

1173
00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably went right back into the</v>

1174
00:54:16.111 --> 00:54:21.111
<v Speaker 1>business a well or something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No illicit or profitable or whatever.</v>

1175
00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a wide variety of people</v>

1176
00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:26.280
<v Speaker 1>that they target.</v>

1177
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:29.220
<v Speaker 1>They target people and individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>crafts.</v>

1178
00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:32.490
<v Speaker 1>The target large boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial vessels.</v>

1179
00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1180
00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.580
<v Speaker 1>they did all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1181
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:37.740
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met hostages from all of those from</v>

1182
00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:39.780
<v Speaker 1>the whole range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So somebody hostage.</v>

1183
00:54:39.781 --> 00:54:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Did you meet over the two years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight months?</v>

1184
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:43.790
<v Speaker 1>A total of 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

1185
00:54:43.791 --> 00:54:47.160
<v Speaker 1>the crew on the fishing ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tune of vessel was 28.</v>

1186
00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:51.520
<v Speaker 1>And then I met [inaudible] fishermen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two guys from the Seychelles.</v>

1187
00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:54.660
<v Speaker 1>We're small time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they weren't just on a small craft.</v>

1188
00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Would it say shells in the Seychelles is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chain of islands off Africa.</v>

1189
00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:02.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a country that belongs to Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1190
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:05.320
<v Speaker 1>but it has a French name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1191
00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:09.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys on the tune of vessel,</v>

1192
00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm more from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1193
00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:15.270
<v Speaker 1>relatively big ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guys from the Seychelles,</v>

1194
00:55:15.271 --> 00:55:19.560
<v Speaker 1>we're from a small private craft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was an example of someone captured</v>

1195
00:55:19.561 --> 00:55:23.830
<v Speaker 1>on land and these people that were from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the small private craft,</v>

1196
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.580
<v Speaker 1>who were they trying to get money from?</v>

1197
00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Just anyone who knows them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how they do this?</v>

1198
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

1199
00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.760
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they asked from the</v>

1200
00:55:32.761 --> 00:55:34.380
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the government doesn't always pay</v>

1201
00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:37.610
<v Speaker 1>the given government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1202
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

1203
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:42.900
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole system seems so insane that</v>

1204
00:55:42.901 --> 00:55:44.000
<v Speaker 1>they've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1205
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:49.790
<v Speaker 1>the key people for years and years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have just a whole collection of</v>

1206
00:55:51.001 --> 00:55:53.760
<v Speaker 1>them and they're trying to extract money</v>
<v Speaker 1>from people that know them.</v>

1207
00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1208
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:56.460
<v Speaker 1>as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not very good at it.</v>

1209
00:55:56.461 --> 00:55:58.230
<v Speaker 1>So pirates are in the kidnapping</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

1210
00:55:58.231 --> 00:55:59.550
<v Speaker 1>but they don't always know what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

1211
00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1212
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:05.940
<v Speaker 1>the bosses I think got used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm demanding a lot of money from</v>

1213
00:56:05.941 --> 00:56:10.500
<v Speaker 1>shipping companies and finding out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hold a ship stubbornly for a long</v>

1214
00:56:10.501 --> 00:56:11.470
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1215
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:14.490
<v Speaker 1>you got a lot of money from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance company or whatever.</v>

1216
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1217
00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.720
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that calculation doesn't work with human</v>

1218
00:56:18.721 --> 00:56:20.730
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

1219
00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:25.140
<v Speaker 1>everyone else on earth who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who for a human being expects of the</v>

1220
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:28.590
<v Speaker 1>person's price to go down as the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1221
00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:32.320
<v Speaker 1>wears on and it took a while for parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand that.</v>

1222
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:35.870
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it,</v>

1223
00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:37.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're dealing,</v>

1224
00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:39.690
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>

1225
00:56:39.691 --> 00:56:44.691
<v Speaker 2>what is it like on your psyche when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting two years in two and a</v>

1226
00:56:45.351 --> 00:56:47.280
<v Speaker 2>half years in and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1227
00:56:47.281 --> 00:56:49.910
<v Speaker 2>you have some sort of light at the end</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the tunnel.</v>

1228
00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.510
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it feel like?</v>

1229
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know there was light at the end</v>

1230
00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:57.400
<v Speaker 1>of the tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm two years in.</v>

1231
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:59.320
<v Speaker 1>That's where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1232
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was either forgive the guards or,</v>

1233
00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:06.460
<v Speaker 1>or self destruct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was also by then I had also</v>

1234
00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:13.470
<v Speaker 1>deliberately given let go of having any</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of hope so that,</v>

1235
00:57:13.471 --> 00:57:16.270
<v Speaker 1>that was the second survival strategy I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to.</v>

1236
00:57:16.271 --> 00:57:19.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hope that I was going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1237
00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:21.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because hoping was,</v>

1238
00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:25.690
<v Speaker 1>had a downside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cycle of hope and despair was</v>

1239
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:30.691
<v Speaker 1>extremely damaging my mental wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the after going through that cycle a</v>

1240
00:57:31.241 --> 00:57:32.074
<v Speaker 1>few times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1241
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I have to find a different way.</v>

1242
00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:40.240
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I've gotten out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of travel is I think it is your view of</v>

1243
00:57:42.381 --> 00:57:45.470
<v Speaker 2>the world changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see the way people are living</v>

1244
00:57:45.471 --> 00:57:49.310
<v Speaker 2>in different places you use your</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum expands.</v>

1245
00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:51.500
<v Speaker 2>You start recognizing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1246
00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:56.450
<v Speaker 2>I might be used to southern California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is not how they do things in</v>

1247
00:57:56.451 --> 00:57:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not how they do things in Italy.</v>

1248
00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:04.150
<v Speaker 2>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you go as far as being a captive in</v>

1249
00:58:06.651 --> 00:58:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Somalia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your your spectrum is massive.</v>

1250
00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:16.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean your view of the world being</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrenched in that life and being with</v>

1251
00:58:16.251 --> 00:58:19.970
<v Speaker 2>those people while they're chewing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>narcotic and carrying around coalition</v>

1252
00:58:19.971 --> 00:58:24.971
<v Speaker 2>of coughs and yelling at each other in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign language and watching fistfights</v>

1253
00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:28.700
<v Speaker 2>and realizing like they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything either.</v>

1254
00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:32.990
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much has that changed you as a human</v>

1255
00:58:32.991 --> 00:58:37.190
<v Speaker 2>being and your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your view of human life on earth?</v>

1256
00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think enormously.</v>

1257
00:58:38.511 --> 00:58:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

1258
00:58:40.251 --> 00:58:43.460
<v Speaker 1>it expanded my range and my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my understanding of,</v>

1259
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:47.930
<v Speaker 1>of what other people think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They obviously come from a completely</v>

1260
00:58:47.931 --> 00:58:52.931
<v Speaker 1>different perspective and Somalia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only are they Muslim and African,</v>

1261
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:57.080
<v Speaker 1>but they're also very isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Somalia as a,</v>

1262
00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:00.950
<v Speaker 1>as a rule has always been difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 1>penetrate for outsiders.</v>

1263
00:59:00.951 --> 00:59:04.880
<v Speaker 1>That was true when Richard Burton was</v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the 19th century to um,</v>

1264
00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:08.420
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a closed culture and um,</v>

1265
00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:13.820
<v Speaker 1>they have their own way of thinking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>also the also the language is not</v>

1266
00:59:13.821 --> 00:59:15.560
<v Speaker 1>related to most other languages you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard,</v>

1267
00:59:15.561 --> 00:59:17.330
<v Speaker 1>unless you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're familiar with languages in</v>

1268
00:59:17.331 --> 00:59:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you learn any of it?</v>

1269
00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:19.873
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

1270
00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:22.563
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1271
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:25.720
<v Speaker 1>I resisted learning it from the guards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1272
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.190
<v Speaker 1>when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about it like,</v>

1273
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:29.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1274
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:34.450
<v Speaker 1>in Berlin you realize that a lot of east</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans when during the communist era</v>

1275
00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:40.460
<v Speaker 1>were taught Russian in school and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them hated it and I was not in a mood</v>

1276
00:59:40.461 --> 00:59:43.080
<v Speaker 1>to learn Somalia Somali once I was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>captive.</v>

1277
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:45.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1278
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:47.090
<v Speaker 1>it was similar to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1279
00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:50.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned a few words,</v>

1280
00:59:50.391 --> 00:59:54.320
<v Speaker 1>but I never had a good teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course when I was a journalist I</v>

1281
00:59:54.321 --> 00:59:55.550
<v Speaker 1>was relying on translators.</v>

1282
00:59:56.410 --> 01:00:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that as a writer that</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum,</v>

1283
01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.940
<v Speaker 2>the expansion of the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although there's no way you would ever</v>

1284
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:09.150
<v Speaker 2>barter it off or bargain to have those</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences to broaden your spectrum it,</v>

1285
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:14.950
<v Speaker 2>it has to have changed the way you put</v>
<v Speaker 2>pen to paper and view the world and</v>

1286
01:00:16.181 --> 01:00:18.790
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ability to describe things.</v>

1287
01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you,</v>

1288
01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:26.740
<v Speaker 1>you realize that each individual has</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain certain boundaries,</v>

1289
01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:31.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and certain certain self definitions and</v>

1290
01:00:31.001 --> 01:00:35.550
<v Speaker 1>those self definitions can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1291
01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.830
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distance between one individual and</v>

1292
01:00:38.831 --> 01:00:42.820
<v Speaker 1>another can be enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in some sense also they're</v>

1293
01:00:42.821 --> 01:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>superficial distinctions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1294
01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1295
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:49.890
<v Speaker 2>they're inescapable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reality is so alien in comparison to</v>

1296
01:00:49.891 --> 01:00:52.230
<v Speaker 2>someone who lives in Bel Air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1297
01:00:52.231 --> 01:00:54.090
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just this,</v>

1298
01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:59.120
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just that contrast between this world</v>

1299
01:00:59.521 --> 01:01:03.930
<v Speaker 2>that you were so deeply entrenched in</v>
<v Speaker 2>for two in two years and eight months</v>

1300
01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.610
<v Speaker 2>like that has got to change the way you</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at human life.</v>

1301
01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the Gulf and wealth is so</v>

1302
01:01:12.211 --> 01:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1303
01:01:13.201 --> 01:01:17.090
<v Speaker 1>they can't imagine that the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money it takes to live in Bel Air and,</v>

1304
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>and the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1305
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very difficult for someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>in California to imagine how little you</v>

1306
01:01:22.291 --> 01:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>can get by on and how close to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

1307
01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Some most people on the planet live</v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

1308
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:29.910
<v Speaker 1>There's a statistic</v>

1309
01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:34.260
<v Speaker 2>that I read once that I repeat all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time because it still baffles me that if</v>

1310
01:01:34.261 --> 01:01:37.920
<v Speaker 2>you make more than $34,000 a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the one percent of the world</v>

1311
01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:38.701
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1312
01:01:38.701 --> 01:01:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1313
01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:46.310
<v Speaker 2>And that is probably magnified manyfold</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Ethiopia.</v>

1314
01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Ethiopia and Somalia.</v>

1315
01:01:48.161 --> 01:01:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

1316
01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:52.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1317
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:56.320
<v Speaker 1>in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they want money all the time,</v>

1318
01:01:56.321 --> 01:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1319
01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money that we're used to sort of</v>

1320
01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:06.670
<v Speaker 1>greasing our path through life around</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is just not available.</v>

1321
01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.650
<v Speaker 1>It's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not part of the reality.</v>

1322
01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:10.750
<v Speaker 1>What do they do with money when they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

1323
01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends if,</v>

1324
01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>if they're pirates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they splash out on fancy car or fancy</v>

1325
01:02:18.761 --> 01:02:20.220
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1326
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was placed in fancy cars.</v>

1327
01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

1328
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:23.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1329
01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:26.390
<v Speaker 1>pirates had great cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1330
01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.990
<v Speaker 1>expensive suv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1331
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>weapons that they had bought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1332
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>from abroad and maybe a weapons bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mogadishu or something like that.</v>

1333
01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not cheap either.</v>

1334
01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.150
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1335
01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>they bragged about how the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bullets cost like a dollar each one</v>

1336
01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might've been wearing a band of 500</v>

1337
01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:45.820
<v Speaker 1>bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1338
01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.400
<v Speaker 1>and the cut is expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so lots of things costs an enormous</v>

1339
01:02:50.401 --> 01:02:52.060
<v Speaker 1>amount of money in Somalia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're,</v>

1340
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a very ordinary Somali,</v>

1341
01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Somali,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting by on less than a dollar</v>

1342
01:02:58.921 --> 01:02:59.700
<v Speaker 1>a day.</v>

1343
01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:04.700
<v Speaker 2>So there's the ordinary Somalis who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not criminals or not pirates at least.</v>

1344
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.460
<v Speaker 2>And then you asked the majority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority,</v>

1345
01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:12.000
<v Speaker 2>and then you have these pirates that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially</v>

1346
01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:16.020
<v Speaker 2>running through the streets and Mercedes</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benz,</v>

1347
01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>they're like gangsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like gangsters.</v>

1348
01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually how one Somali,</v>

1349
01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>who had some connection to Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm described them to me,</v>

1350
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:24.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1351
01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>he was wandering around and got kyle</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was his hometown in some way</v>

1352
01:03:27.551 --> 01:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>or his ancestral ancestral town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had met some.</v>

1353
01:03:30.671 --> 01:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>This was before I got captured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like they were,</v>

1354
01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had wrapped them being from the</v>

1355
01:03:34.451 --> 01:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>SUV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they really?</v>

1356
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>American rap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>

1357
01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.180
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of actually good African</v>

1358
01:03:40.181 --> 01:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>rap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1359
01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Senegalese Rep.</v>

1360
01:03:43.310 --> 01:03:44.900
<v Speaker 2>have you ever ever heard west African</v>
<v Speaker 2>rap?</v>

1361
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Because I love music that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the words too.</v>

1362
01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1363
01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.240
<v Speaker 2>I can send you some band names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please do.</v>

1364
01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although when I write,</v>

1365
01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I like to listen to the stinky things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't understand because I can</v>

1366
01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.230
<v Speaker 2>still write and not think about their</v>
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>

1367
01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1368
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:05.540
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're around these gangsters and</v>

1369
01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:07.700
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get this sense of like,</v>

1370
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>

1371
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:11.750
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need this money like this.</v>

1372
01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.530
<v Speaker 2>They want to keep this going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to need more money funnel.</v>

1373
01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.330
<v Speaker 2>This is just a never ending cycle.</v>

1374
01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.300
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's obviously how it seemed.</v>

1375
01:04:19.301 --> 01:04:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the.</v>

1376
01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:22.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some of the guards,</v>

1377
01:04:22.541 --> 01:04:26.080
<v Speaker 1>some of the lower ranking and maybe some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the gentler guards,</v>

1378
01:04:26.081 --> 01:04:27.960
<v Speaker 1>the ones who got along with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1379
01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>did not necessarily want to be gangsters</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of their lives.</v>

1380
01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:36.810
<v Speaker 1>So I think for some people the plan was</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a bunch of money and get out,</v>

1381
01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1382
01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:41.890
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an operation,</v>

1383
01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just needed,</v>

1384
01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>there was no limit to the money they</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed or wanted.</v>

1385
01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the end the real motivation is not</v>

1386
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>illegal fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but greed.</v>

1387
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:57.670
<v Speaker 2>And do they have any sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It initially started with illegal</v>

1388
01:04:57.741 --> 01:04:58.610
<v Speaker 2>fishing though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1389
01:04:58.700 --> 01:04:59.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1390
01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:02.630
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have any sort of ultimate goal?</v>

1391
01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:06.020
<v Speaker 2>Like one day I'm going to retire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a mansion in the</v>

1392
01:05:06.021 --> 01:05:06.580
<v Speaker 2>hills.</v>

1393
01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think individually they do and some</v>

1394
01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>bosses get a mansion and a big compound</v>
<v Speaker 1>and live large and then they,</v>

1395
01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:17.380
<v Speaker 1>they try and hire younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger pirates and that of thing.</v>

1396
01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about piracy and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism.</v>

1397
01:05:20.471 --> 01:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>So Al Shabaab is the Al Qaeda aligned</v>
<v Speaker 1>group in Somalia.</v>

1398
01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Al Shabaab and pirates are the two main</v>

1399
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.480
<v Speaker 1>corporate structures in Somalia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

1400
01:05:31.481 --> 01:05:33.460
<v Speaker 1>if you're a young man and you know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use a gun,</v>

1401
01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>those are the places you join up with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be upwardly mobile,</v>

1402
01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:43.290
<v Speaker 1>if you want to impress somebody and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>promotions and make money and,</v>

1403
01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:48.670
<v Speaker 1>and marry a wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those were the most available options.</v>

1404
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1405
01:05:50.141 --> 01:05:54.480
<v Speaker 1>you had scarce jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some frustrating sheep herding or,</v>

1406
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:58.990
<v Speaker 1>or fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a more interesting jobs in the</v>

1407
01:05:58.991 --> 01:06:02.770
<v Speaker 1>cities but not very many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe a pretty well paid you</v>

1408
01:06:02.771 --> 01:06:03.690
<v Speaker 1>end job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1409
01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:04.563
<v Speaker 1>if you're lucky.</v>

1410
01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:07.090
<v Speaker 1>So that these things are very tempting</v>
<v Speaker 1>for young,</v>

1411
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:11.650
<v Speaker 1>young Somalis and even if the pirate</v>
<v Speaker 1>bosses are no longer capturing ships on</v>

1412
01:06:11.651 --> 01:06:14.680
<v Speaker 1>the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fallen off quite a bit in the last</v>

1413
01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.750
<v Speaker 1>few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've still got other businesses going</v>

1414
01:06:16.751 --> 01:06:17.560
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including,</v>

1415
01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.870
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human smuggling and gun smuggling.</v>

1416
01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody have aspirations to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>

1417
01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you run into anybody that</v>

1418
01:06:24.821 --> 01:06:28.060
<v Speaker 1>understands that the rest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there are opportunities to live in</v>

1419
01:06:28.061 --> 01:06:32.500
<v Speaker 1>a place where you don't have this kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of systemic violence and crime?</v>

1420
01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

1421
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:34.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1422
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:36.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't necessarily understand the</v>

1423
01:06:36.401 --> 01:06:39.130
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they know that somebody is in</v>

1424
01:06:39.131 --> 01:06:41.740
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of people wanted to get out</v>

1425
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:44.530
<v Speaker 1>and some of the guards to talk to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>about wanting to go to Europe,</v>

1426
01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:49.240
<v Speaker 1>but one of them who did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I described him in the book,</v>

1427
01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:51.250
<v Speaker 1>he wound up getting married in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mogadishu.</v>

1428
01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:53.110
<v Speaker 1>I found it so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1429
01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I wound up with a wedding photograph</v>
<v Speaker 1>from him.</v>

1430
01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he ended up not going,</v>

1431
01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.510
<v Speaker 1>which was smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't touch with them,</v>

1432
01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:04.730
<v Speaker 1>not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One guy</v>

1433
01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.170
<v Speaker 1>found me on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course Jesus Christ.</v>

1434
01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:13.750
<v Speaker 1>One of your captors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the guards know that one of the</v>

1435
01:07:13.790 --> 01:07:14.990
<v Speaker 1>gentler guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys,</v>

1436
01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:19.460
<v Speaker 1>like when you get a message on facebook</v>
<v Speaker 1>from someone who held a gun to you.</v>

1437
01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:24.640
<v Speaker 1>At first I didn't want to answer him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but slowly I realized that I could get</v>

1438
01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:30.341
<v Speaker 1>good information from him on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not friends.</v>

1439
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:32.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've explained this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not.</v>

1440
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:36.890
<v Speaker 1>We didn't become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't let him into my life on</v>

1441
01:07:36.891 --> 01:07:38.360
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

1442
01:07:38.361 --> 01:07:39.920
<v Speaker 1>we messaged each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

1443
01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.790
<v Speaker 1>You set limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1444
01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Still do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you said that you,</v>

1445
01:07:47.490 --> 01:07:50.660
<v Speaker 1>you had forgiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was very important.</v>

1446
01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you express that to him?</v>

1447
01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1448
01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.310
<v Speaker 1>at least in my tone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

1449
01:07:57.550 --> 01:07:59.410
<v Speaker 1>he was one of the easiest people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgive.</v>

1450
01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:00.700
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

1451
01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.610
<v Speaker 1>he was never obnoxious or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or violent towards me.</v>

1452
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for belonging to this violent,</v>

1453
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.780
<v Speaker 1>violent gang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was personally never,</v>

1454
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:12.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1455
01:08:12.611 --> 01:08:14.560
<v Speaker 1>as obnoxious as some of the other guards</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>

1456
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Did you try</v>

1457
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:19.760
<v Speaker 2>to communicate to him that the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is different?</v>

1458
01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Did you try to communicate to him what</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like where,</v>

1459
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:29.960
<v Speaker 2>where you grew up and then your</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience as a human being is so wildly</v>

1460
01:08:29.961 --> 01:08:30.770
<v Speaker 2>different?</v>

1461
01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:31.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not.</v>

1462
01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.300
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't our topic of conversation.</v>

1463
01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever think of introducing that?</v>

1464
01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I got some of that information from him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>

1465
01:08:43.071 --> 01:08:46.220
<v Speaker 1>He told me a little bit about his</v>
<v Speaker 1>background and it was military as a</v>

1466
01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:48.350
<v Speaker 1>matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is typical.</v>

1467
01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.150
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them are trained gunman.</v>

1468
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1469
01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:56.770
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't anxious to share a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information with them,</v>

1470
01:08:56.830 --> 01:08:58.280
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he reads my book,</v>

1471
01:08:58.281 --> 01:09:00.370
<v Speaker 1>he'll learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a lot of personal background in</v>

1472
01:09:00.371 --> 01:09:01.204
<v Speaker 1>the book.</v>

1473
01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1474
01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:08.560
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to even imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1475
01:09:08.561 --> 01:09:10.210
<v Speaker 2>there's some people that tell you things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

1476
01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.590
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can kind of imagine that,</v>

1477
01:09:12.130 --> 01:09:17.130
<v Speaker 2>but your story is so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost impossible to even imagine</v>

1478
01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:22.360
<v Speaker 2>so unique in that you grew up in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly western world,</v>

1479
01:09:22.361 --> 01:09:22.950
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1480
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:24.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first world,</v>

1481
01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:30.100
<v Speaker 2>you're in Germany and then you go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somalia and get captured and stay there</v>

1482
01:09:30.101 --> 01:09:31.480
<v Speaker 2>and alters your reality.</v>

1483
01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did.</v>

1484
01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.570
<v Speaker 1>It really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

1485
01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:36.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot more fucked up than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>expected to be.</v>

1486
01:09:36.521 --> 01:09:37.720
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

1487
01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:40.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have wished for this.</v>

1488
01:09:40.751 --> 01:09:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have wished for this on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>family either.</v>

1489
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1490
01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Do you think about Somalia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think about what,</v>

1491
01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:55.480
<v Speaker 2>what it must be like to be a person</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's stuck there that lives there?</v>

1492
01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had plenty of opportunity to think</v>

1493
01:09:57.411 --> 01:09:58.030
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1494
01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:59.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was obviously behind what,</v>

1495
01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:02.060
<v Speaker 1>what my guards were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1496
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:06.080
<v Speaker 1>so that was on my mind quite a lot and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1497
01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:09.500
<v Speaker 1>that's where he realized that actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the world lives quite poor.</v>

1498
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:12.320
<v Speaker 1>The Somalia is one of the poorest</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

1499
01:10:12.321 --> 01:10:16.280
<v Speaker 1>so it's even under the average line for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1500
01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:17.870
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm,</v>

1501
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:18.980
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clear that</v>

1502
01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.450
<v Speaker 1>most of the world doesn't live like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we do in the West.</v>

1503
01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.550
<v Speaker 2>What was a day like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1504
01:10:25.551 --> 01:10:28.940
<v Speaker 2>what did you typically do other than be</v>
<v Speaker 2>shackled to sleep and.</v>

1505
01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it depended where I was if I was on</v>

1506
01:10:32.631 --> 01:10:35.940
<v Speaker 1>the ship then there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1507
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.350
<v Speaker 1>we slept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I slept in the cabin along with 10 other</v>

1508
01:10:39.351 --> 01:10:42.430
<v Speaker 1>hostages and then we came out to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deck in the morning and heck,</v>

1509
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:45.830
<v Speaker 1>instant coffee and something for</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast.</v>

1510
01:10:45.831 --> 01:10:48.200
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the food was not bad because it was</v>

1511
01:10:48.201 --> 01:10:53.201
<v Speaker 1>still an operating fishing vessel and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>got piles of rice and basically Chinese</v>

1512
01:10:54.801 --> 01:10:57.500
<v Speaker 1>food from the kitchen as long as</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplies lasted,</v>

1513
01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1514
01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:03.740
<v Speaker 1>once I was on land and then I just woke</v>
<v Speaker 1>up alone under a mosquito tent and</v>

1515
01:11:03.741 --> 01:11:05.250
<v Speaker 1>wondered what to do that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1516
01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I had to live in my head quite a bit if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have paper and pen to write</v>

1517
01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:11.000
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1518
01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:12.830
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't for at least a year and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1519
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:15.810
<v Speaker 1>I had to sort of right in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1520
01:11:15.811 --> 01:11:17.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually composed paragraphs in my</v>

1521
01:11:17.581 --> 01:11:19.800
<v Speaker 1>head and went through them and memorize</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1522
01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.220
<v Speaker 1>And eventually I had a two hour routine</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning where I just lay,</v>

1523
01:11:24.330 --> 01:11:26.220
<v Speaker 1>lay still and went through these words</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my head.</v>

1524
01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:30.660
<v Speaker 1>That was one way to keep saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you remembered the individual</v>

1525
01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:35.661
<v Speaker 1>paragraphs and you put them in an order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was revising books in my head.</v>

1526
01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:37.410
<v Speaker 1>So I would go through and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1527
01:11:37.411 --> 01:11:38.970
<v Speaker 1>this needs work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1528
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:42.990
<v Speaker 1>might as well get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would compose a paragraph,</v>

1529
01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:45.840
<v Speaker 1>refine it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memorize it all in my head,</v>

1530
01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that do comedy that way.</v>

1531
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:52.170
<v Speaker 1>They don't really write only right in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their head,</v>

1532
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:55.070
<v Speaker 1>but they still call it writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1533
01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.280
<v Speaker 1>I found that interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

1534
01:11:56.281 --> 01:11:57.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the best way for me to</v>

1535
01:11:57.601 --> 01:11:59.490
<v Speaker 1>constantly remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1536
01:11:59.491 --> 01:12:00.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1537
01:12:00.031 --> 01:12:01.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what I had to do.</v>

1538
01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Commit it to memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you sat down there and when you</v>

1539
01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:09.951
<v Speaker 1>were going over the material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a purposeful strategy in order</v>

1540
01:12:10.351 --> 01:12:12.930
<v Speaker 1>to keep your sanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give herself some,</v>

1541
01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:18.020
<v Speaker 1>some order and keep my mind occupied and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I and I would memorize that.</v>

1542
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.810
<v Speaker 1>And then I also had like a list of names</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the ship to memorize.</v>

1543
01:12:21.811 --> 01:12:24.660
<v Speaker 1>So I had written all their names down</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the proper spellings.</v>

1544
01:12:24.661 --> 01:12:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was still optimistic when I,</v>

1545
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:28.410
<v Speaker 1>when I was on the ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1546
01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:32.730
<v Speaker 1>and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had an incredibly complex list of</v>

1547
01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.590
<v Speaker 1>names from the crewman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1548
01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.800
<v Speaker 1>which I lost and so lost them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost the list between the ship and</v>

1549
01:12:40.051 --> 01:12:44.190
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So remembering their names became part</v>

1550
01:12:44.191 --> 01:12:48.630
<v Speaker 1>of my morning routine to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is obviously phonetic,</v>

1551
01:12:48.631 --> 01:12:50.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're dealing with Asian</v>

1552
01:12:50.011 --> 01:12:52.390
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had learned to spell them though A.</v>

1553
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Luckily when I got out I got a list of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the women's names from the FBI.</v>

1554
01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:59.683
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1555
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did this book come out?</v>

1556
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just came out last week and uh,</v>

1557
01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:08.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a few years in the making.</v>

1558
01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Is it difficult to do conversations like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

1559
01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:12.450
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

1560
01:13:12.451 --> 01:13:14.430
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier now that I've written it,</v>

1561
01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:18.060
<v Speaker 1>so I'm fluent with this material now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I first got out I wouldn't have</v>

1562
01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.430
<v Speaker 1>been able to talk about it like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have,</v>

1563
01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I would've just bumped up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have known where to start.</v>

1564
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:28.530
<v Speaker 1>What do you anticipate doing once this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1565
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:31.240
<v Speaker 1>once the dust settled and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1566
01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:34.050
<v Speaker 1>for firmly established and you're done</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the promos?</v>

1567
01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm,</v>

1568
01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on a new book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1569
01:13:37.621 --> 01:13:38.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1570
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:42.960
<v Speaker 1>the novel moving onto the drone on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>novel and I'm following the story,</v>

1571
01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.170
<v Speaker 1>a couple of stories in the meantime to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

1572
01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:49.820
<v Speaker 1>some journalism and I worked for hostage</v>
<v Speaker 1>us at the moment too,</v>

1573
01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:53.130
<v Speaker 1>which is a good nonprofit that supports</v>
<v Speaker 1>families</v>

1574
01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:59.990
<v Speaker 1>that might have somebody in captivity</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and the US government as it</v>

1575
01:14:00.361 --> 01:14:03.870
<v Speaker 1>turns out helps families in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in really good ways,</v>

1576
01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:06.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the ways that they can't,</v>

1577
01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:10.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of just letting the families</v>

1578
01:14:10.471 --> 01:14:13.270
<v Speaker 1>know what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to expect and what might be going</v>

1579
01:14:13.271 --> 01:14:15.130
<v Speaker 1>on with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people,</v>

1580
01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:17.920
<v Speaker 1>a hostage us can step in and help.</v>

1581
01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:22.290
<v Speaker 2>I think your story is really important</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's not just important in</v>

1582
01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:24.200
<v Speaker 2>terms of like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1583
01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:29.290
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you've had an incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep view of what it's like to live</v>

1584
01:14:29.551 --> 01:14:31.770
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that you,</v>

1585
01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.040
<v Speaker 2>you've got your life back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1586
01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:39.770
<v Speaker 2>And in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this experience of no hope and sorrow</v>

1587
01:14:40.741 --> 01:14:44.700
<v Speaker 2>and captivity and all the various</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggles that you went through,</v>

1588
01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:47.850
<v Speaker 2>you've experienced something that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1589
01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:52.500
<v Speaker 2>very few human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the 7 billion people on this</v>

1590
01:14:52.501 --> 01:14:56.040
<v Speaker 2>planet and all their struggles and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trials and tribulations,</v>

1591
01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.660
<v Speaker 2>there's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what small handful have been held</v>

1592
01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:04.980
<v Speaker 2>captive by Somali pirates and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>managed to live</v>

1593
01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.320
<v Speaker 1>well there's a network of former</v>
<v Speaker 1>captives and that's what hostage us is</v>

1594
01:15:09.321 --> 01:15:11.270
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1595
01:15:11.271 --> 01:15:14.300
<v Speaker 1>how many people have been held captive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>owe more than you realize.</v>

1596
01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:19.420
<v Speaker 1>But there were several of us are still</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive and so it's the best people for me</v>

1597
01:15:21.861 --> 01:15:25.850
<v Speaker 1>to talk to when I first got out was</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people who've been captive David</v>

1598
01:15:25.851 --> 01:15:29.210
<v Speaker 1>road who was held hostage by the Taliban</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was working for the New York</v>

1599
01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was also on the board of the Pulitzer</v>

1600
01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Center when I got captured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he followed my story.</v>

1601
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Talking to him after I got out was</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>

1602
01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:39.070
<v Speaker 1>It was better than a psychologist and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was aware of.</v>

1603
01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.040
<v Speaker 1>He escaped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1604
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:42.410
<v Speaker 1>so I was aware of his story when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1605
01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.390
<v Speaker 1>So we were thinking about each other in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way,</v>

1606
01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:45.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're friends now.</v>

1607
01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:50.860
<v Speaker 1>It's great talking to someone who's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>through it is psychologically the best</v>

1608
01:15:51.021 --> 01:15:51.854
<v Speaker 1>thing</v>

1609
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:53.850
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the numbers in terms of how</v>

1610
01:15:53.851 --> 01:15:57.020
<v Speaker 2>many people who've been held captive by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Somalis?</v>

1611
01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:57.983
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biosimilars</v>

1612
01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:00.610
<v Speaker 1>currently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1613
01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.160
<v Speaker 1>It's down to about four radian</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishermen.</v>

1614
01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:04.540
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1615
01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:07.360
<v Speaker 1>And then a couple of who were actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>captured by pirates and then a couple</v>

1616
01:16:07.361 --> 01:16:08.110
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1617
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Kenyon too I think were handed over to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pirate game.</v>

1618
01:16:10.810 --> 01:16:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's much reduced,</v>

1619
01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:14.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>

1620
01:16:14.501 --> 01:16:17.020
<v Speaker 1>in the home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three crew when they got out was the</v>

1621
01:16:17.021 --> 01:16:19.270
<v Speaker 1>last big crew that was being held by</v>
<v Speaker 1>pirates.</v>

1622
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:22.540
<v Speaker 1>They got out in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the pirate era,</v>

1623
01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:24.920
<v Speaker 1>you might say is sort of tapering off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1624
01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:26.410
<v Speaker 1>but why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1625
01:16:26.411 --> 01:16:30.160
<v Speaker 1>because I'm white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was while I was there,</v>

1626
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:34.360
<v Speaker 1>pirate stopped being so active on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water and I slowly gleaned that from,</v>

1627
01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the BBC or whatever I was listening</v>

1628
01:16:37.601 --> 01:16:39.220
<v Speaker 1>to and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1629
01:16:39.221 --> 01:16:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I came here and write a story about</v>
<v Speaker 1>pirates.</v>

1630
01:16:41.051 --> 01:16:42.160
<v Speaker 1>And now it's not even a story.</v>

1631
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:47.140
<v Speaker 1>You've become this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became the story,</v>

1632
01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:48.970
<v Speaker 1>it was not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1633
01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:54.020
<v Speaker 1>but it fell off in 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even a little earlier,</v>

1634
01:16:54.050 --> 01:16:57.760
<v Speaker 1>late 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because the boss has shifted</v>

1635
01:16:57.761 --> 01:17:02.680
<v Speaker 1>their focus to other businesses and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>found it less profitable to hold people</v>

1636
01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.800
<v Speaker 1>have probably also because of my case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in my,</v>

1637
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:10.340
<v Speaker 1>my case wasn't moving along and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mainly because,</v>

1638
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:13.610
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this still has to be true to keep piracy</v>

1639
01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:17.600
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cargo ships sail now with,</v>

1640
01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:19.100
<v Speaker 1>with our teams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1641
01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:20.690
<v Speaker 1>contractors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1642
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:24.680
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out a spatter of gunfire in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water can keep a skift from coming</v>

1643
01:17:24.681 --> 01:17:25.720
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1644
01:17:25.730 --> 01:17:28.520
<v Speaker 1>that's enough and it should be enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

1645
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.970
<v Speaker 1>that's really the main,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main defense,</v>

1646
01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.290
<v Speaker 1>the naval teams that still cruise off</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somalia,</v>

1647
01:17:35.291 --> 01:17:37.790
<v Speaker 1>there is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very important formality,</v>

1648
01:17:38.210 --> 01:17:42.710
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they practically stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual cases the way in our team</v>

1649
01:17:42.711 --> 01:17:43.400
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

1650
01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.740
<v Speaker 1>And there was a lot of fear about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>beforehand.</v>

1651
01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:50.760
<v Speaker 1>A lot of fear about putting weapons on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilian cargo ship or a merchant ship.</v>

1652
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few people thought there would be like</v>

1653
01:17:54.681 --> 01:17:57.570
<v Speaker 1>an arms race in the water and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1654
01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.900
<v Speaker 1>pirates would come on with heavier</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons or whatever.</v>

1655
01:18:00.230 --> 01:18:02.720
<v Speaker 1>It turns out not to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1656
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:04.970
<v Speaker 1>what did the bosses shift their</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to?</v>

1657
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1658
01:18:07.281 --> 01:18:11.120
<v Speaker 1>probably some human smuggling drugs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons smuggling,</v>

1659
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:12.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>

1660
01:18:12.170 --> 01:18:15.440
<v Speaker 1>they have portfolios,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have other businesses and they just</v>

1661
01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:19.100
<v Speaker 1>roll it over into something else if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if piracy becomes too difficult.</v>

1662
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:23.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the precautions that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shipping industry now takes,</v>

1663
01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1664
01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.510
<v Speaker 1>have been enough to make it too</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult for the bosses.</v>

1665
01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Did you take any consideration or do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>anticipate in any way a cure for what</v>

1666
01:18:33.891 --> 01:18:34.724
<v Speaker 1>ails them?</v>

1667
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

1668
01:18:35.751 --> 01:18:38.240
<v Speaker 1>that was another idea that sent me</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1669
01:18:38.241 --> 01:18:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to investigate the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1670
01:18:42.730 --> 01:18:47.270
<v Speaker 1>of just joining a legitimate business in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somalia because America went through the</v>

1671
01:18:47.271 --> 01:18:49.190
<v Speaker 1>same cycle three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 years ago.</v>

1672
01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had pirates when we're colonials.</v>

1673
01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:54.830
<v Speaker 1>We had pirates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very savage ones who sailed from the</v>

1674
01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:57.830
<v Speaker 1>eastern seaboard out to Africa actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to the Horn of Africa.</v>

1675
01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:01.730
<v Speaker 1>And they were very brutal to Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was reversed and um,</v>

1676
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000
<v Speaker 1>we recovered from it by becoming a</v>
<v Speaker 1>country and becoming responsible for our</v>

1677
01:19:07.251 --> 01:19:08.530
<v Speaker 1>own economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1678
01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in Somalia now it's a</v>

1679
01:19:10.671 --> 01:19:13.730
<v Speaker 1>lot of illicit business activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as business activity,</v>

1680
01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:17.870
<v Speaker 1>you turn it into something listed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>give people jobs.</v>

1681
01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:20.330
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to be pirates anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1682
01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:22.760
<v Speaker 1>and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are ways to do that and I think</v>

1683
01:19:22.761 --> 01:19:26.780
<v Speaker 1>slowly people who have power in Somalia</v>
<v Speaker 1>or figuring that out,</v>

1684
01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:30.920
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still a lot of criminals that have</v>

1685
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:33.110
<v Speaker 1>too much power in Somalia.</v>

1686
01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to touch a book until I</v>

1687
01:19:36.861 --> 01:19:40.630
<v Speaker 2>met you wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to somehow or another have a</v>

1688
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:43.820
<v Speaker 2>fresh conversation and get your</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective on this.</v>

1689
01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:47.870
<v Speaker 2>But I think your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your view of the world is very valuable</v>

1690
01:19:47.871 --> 01:19:49.430
<v Speaker 2>and it's just very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different.</v>

1691
01:19:49.431 --> 01:19:52.130
<v Speaker 2>And I'm so happy that you got out and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>

1692
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:56.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm so happy he wrote this book and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't wait to check it out.</v>

1693
01:19:56.391 --> 01:19:58.880
<v Speaker 2>It's available now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The desert and the sea.</v>

1694
01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:01.470
<v Speaker 2>And just thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for being here.</v>

1695
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:02.640

<v Speaker 2>really appreciate it.</v>
