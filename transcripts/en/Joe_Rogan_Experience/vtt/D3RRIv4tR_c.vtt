1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.390
Start.
It can be.
Yeah.

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.513
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.270
<v 2>Chris Ryan and I have decided that for my friend Steve Run is easy.</v>

4
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.950
Who just admitted that he lied about working in the September 11th,

5
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.450
uh,
the twin towers during September 11th.
That we're just going to lie all day.

6
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.610
So this podcast is all bullshit.

7
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.530
Everything we say psychologically it,
fuck this.
This is a,

8
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.310
this is a tough one for me cause I really liked Steve.
He's a good friend.

9
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.040
I really liked that guy.
See Him at the comedy store all the time.

10
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.750
I've known him for years.

11
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.580
I really like him and then I see this and I'm just like,
Jesus Christ,

12
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.650
you know what,
what gets me,

13
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.840
it gets me when someone does something like this is I imagine what it would be

14
00:00:55.191 --> 00:01:00.191
like to be them to have told some sort of a crazy line and got stuck telling it

15
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.300
where you're repeating it over and over again and then you just got,

16
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.400
it just becomes like,
it's,
it's locked in.
It's like how do you erase it?

17
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.800
How do you go back and get a lie away?

18
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.070
<v 0>Especially if you transition from like a regular guy who just bullshits with his</v>

19
00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:23.320
friends to a public figure.
Like I guess this guy got famous at that point.

20
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.780
Right.

21
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.160
So then you've got your lies that all your friends think are true and now you're

22
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:31.340
doing interviews with the fucking Wall Street Journal or whatever.

23
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.950
And if that comes up,
what do you do?

24
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:37.910
You stick to your guns or you humiliate yourself,

25
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.080
you know in your private circle.
You know,
cause you got a,
there's that,

26
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.110
well apparently

27
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.210
<v 2>did humiliate himself in his private circle.</v>

28
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.330
He pulled Ari and up few guys aside years ago and told them that it wasn't true.

29
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.300
No Shit.
Yeah.
Oh that's interesting.
Yeah.

30
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:57.150
I mean I guess it just been fucking with them forever,

31
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.780
<v 0>you know.
Good for him.
He's coming out of the closet.</v>

32
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.850
Although he got pulled out of the closet.

33
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:05.770
I think that you have pulled out by the New York Times.

34
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.420
<v 2>The New York Times got them.
You know,</v>

35
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.810
they do their research and they found out that he didn't really work for Merrill

36
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.621
Lynch.
You know,

37
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:15.200
he said he worked for Merrill Lynch for like a year and a half as an account

38
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.390
manager.
Didn't really work with Maryland.

39
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.940
<v 0>Well,
as you were saying before,
the Mikes.
Why not like what a dumb ass lie.
Oh,</v>

40
00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.820
Merrill Lynch Account Manager.
Well how,
let me suck your Dick.

41
00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:28.090
Like who gives a shit?
You don't need to work for my,
Hey,

42
00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:30.370
I used to be an accountant baby.
You know,

43
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.150
like I like how lies for Chris Ryan immediately translate it.

44
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.210
Why else?
Why else would you like nothing else is worth it,

45
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.290
you know?
I guess to get a better job or something.
Maybe that would be something.

46
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:45.220
I don't want a job.

47
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.260
My entire life has been about avoiding ever having a job other than blow job

48
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.120
writing books.
Even just like,
God,

49
00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:57.730
let me just get this out of the way so I don't have to have a job.
Dude.

50
00:02:57.731 --> 00:03:01.540
I don't ever want to write another book in my life even that I'm trying to get

51
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:06.250
out of.
That's hilarious.
But you're an author,
you're in luck.

52
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:09.310
Stablish this successful author and you're like,
fuck,

53
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:10.870
I don't even want to do that,
dude.

54
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:15.430
I wrote a book and suddenly was running a business.

55
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.700
Like I never wanted to have a business.
I'm not a business guy.

56
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.520
What is the business,
Chris Ryan ink and yeah.

57
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.010
You know what it's like if you're in the paper,

58
00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:31.011
suddenly managers are calling you and lawyers and you've got account,

59
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.950
you've got the sort of parasite infrastructure they'd gloms onto you.

60
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:38.350
Like you know those things on the bottom of boats,
you know,

61
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.420
and it's like no offense to any accountants who are parasites,

62
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.040
but you know what I mean?
And I mean,
you know,

63
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.500
Joe Rogan enterprises is a huge thing,
you know,

64
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:54.490
and you must be a mistake a lot of time,
a lot of attention.
And so even in my,

65
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:58.380
you know,
micro scale,
it's just a giant pain in the ass.
It certainly

66
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.860
<v 3>can be.
Fortunately for me,</v>

67
00:04:00.861 --> 00:04:04.600
I don't think of anything that I'm doing as like really work work.
Yeah.
You know,

68
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:09.140
it's just stuff I enjoyed doing.
That happens to be an occupation rather than,

69
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.300
<v 0>but yeah,
I mean what you're doing,</v>

70
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:15.570
you're at a level where you can afford to hire good people to help you.

71
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.140
[inaudible] I'm not,
and my wife is useless,

72
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.910
so I mean,
she's a wonderful woman,
don't get me wrong.

73
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.920
And she's very good at certain things,
but you know,
producing a podcast,

74
00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:32.370
editing a book,
right?
You know,
this kind of stuff I need someone to do.

75
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.030
I mean I have to answer her emails,
you know,
she can't be bothered

76
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.020
<v 3>when you,
when you hear a guy like this rent as easy story,
when you hear a lie,</v>

77
00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:42.510
does that,
does it freak you out?
And you know what,

78
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:45.510
here's the thing that freaks me out and it freaks me out.

79
00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:49.710
Like even like the Jared from subway thing or when I read something about some

80
00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:53.290
guy who was messed up,
I forget what the article was about.

81
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:54.510
I think what the article was about,

82
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.250
a guy who was friends with the guy who turned out to be a murderer and it's

83
00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:00.600
about a guy who got messed up.

84
00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:05.601
And and gotten involved in some rough sex with some prostitute and killed her

85
00:05:05.851 --> 00:05:09.810
and then solder up and left her fucking body and bags and shit.

86
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.800
It could've been an accident.

87
00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:15.801
What whenever I hear about anybody who's just gone completely off the rails like

88
00:05:17.161 --> 00:05:21.300
that,
I always say,
okay,
if I was that guy,

89
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.470
if I was born in his shoes,
if I lived his life,

90
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:26.970
would I have been that fucking guy?

91
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.590
Like how much of what we are is determinism.
You know,

92
00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:34.590
how much of what we are is based on the events that took place,
that have,

93
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.880
that are completely outside of our control about how much of it is how we were

94
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:39.481
raised.

95
00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:43.830
I mean we've all heard people tell like terrible stories about how their parents

96
00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:44.664
raised them.

97
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.690
Terrible stories about the environment they're forced into and you always wonder

98
00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:51.870
like how much of who each one of us is.

99
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.820
It is based on a bunch of shit that's completely outside of your control and how

100
00:05:56.821 --> 00:05:58.340
much of these events

101
00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.173
<v 2>that take place,</v>

102
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.950
whether it's the Jared from subway thing or I had my friend Barry Crimmins on

103
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:04.400
who's this,

104
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.400
a great comedian and a real icon in Boston and Bobcat Goldthwait did a film on

105
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:14.420
him about his horrific childhood sexual abuse.

106
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.750
He was raped when he was four years old by his babysitters boyfriend and it was

107
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:24.050
this horrific,
horrific story.
And you know,

108
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.470
this is something completely outside of this guy's control and how much of who

109
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:32.471
he is now is based on how well he's like in his fifties and this is like still

110
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:37.940
some things he's dealing with from when he was four.
You know,
it's just you,

111
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.390
you are now is like this series of these series of events that have kind of,

112
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.250
a lot of them just laid out in front of you without you having any control over

113
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:53.660
it at all.
Now here you are.

114
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.800
And when I see a guy that does something really crazy,

115
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.180
I mean this is like minorly crazy.
We're not talking about a horrific crime,

116
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:05.940
like a bill Cosby thing or something like that.
We're back to the comedian.

117
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.520
The comedian.
Yeah.
Thought the chopped up process.
I mean,

118
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.160
Steve Run is easy.
My friend,
you know,

119
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.300
w w w it's what he did was just doesn't make any sense.

120
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.730
Like,
and you just wonder like what?

121
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:24.470
It must be like fuck to be that guy who's done that.

122
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:27.200
It was just like said this thing for no fucking reason.

123
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:31.910
That doesn't make any sense.
And then it has to stick with it.
Just I don't,

124
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.500
I mean that's my angle on these things instead of getting upset about me.

125
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.970
Especially this one.
But how does that relate to what you're saying?

126
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:41.810
Do you feel like if you may,
if you were in the position he was in,

127
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:45.380
you might've done something similar?
I always worry that,
yeah.
I always,

128
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:49.160
whenever I see someone do anything crazy like murder or craziness or anything,

129
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:49.994
I always say,
well,

130
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:55.090
how much of who you are is because of your life experiences with a lot of them

131
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.960
outside of your control,
your genetics,
your parents,
the,

132
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.440
the environment that you were raised up in,

133
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:02.660
the people that you came in contact with when you were younger,

134
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.730
how much of that is who you are today in 2015 I think it's,
God damn it.

135
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:12.530
I think it's a lot.
Yeah.
And so I see this guy,
you know,

136
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.720
my friend,
and again,
Steve,
Ron is easy.
What he did was just dumb.
It's not evil.

137
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.350
It's not,
nobody got hurt,
you know?
I mean,
he might've hurt someone's feelings.

138
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:25.460
People that actually were survivors of nine 11 and the pretend that's

139
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:28.640
potentially possible.
But you know what I mean?
He didn't rape anybody.

140
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:33.350
He didn't murder anybody.
It's just fucking what happened.

141
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.520
How does that,
how's the brain gets so sick?
Fucking tweaked.

142
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.870
So in of the lies,
he's been busted for the,

143
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.040
I was in the twin towers at nine 11 is the one that everyone's focused on.

144
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.890
And no one gives a fuck about lying about working for Maryland.
Right.

145
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.570
Although I don't understand why you would write,
like you said.
And also like,

146
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.040
you know,
I,
I

147
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.930
<v 4>would argue that anyone who was a survivor of nine 11 who was actually there has</v>

148
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.970
bigger issues think about than social media and is,

149
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.420
so I would argue he didn't really hurt anyone except himself now that he's

150
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:14.700
busted rationally.
Yeah,
you're right.
So who gives a shit?
You know,

151
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:18.240
and everybody,
everybody in public life is lying on some level,
right?
You're,

152
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:22.560
you've got a persona and you have to be true to that persona even.

153
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.641
I mean,

154
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:28.020
I remember when I first sat down with this producer to talk about doing a TV

155
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:29.970
show and,
um,

156
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.560
which ultimately never got made like most TV shows.
But,
um,

157
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.790
when we were like putting together the,
the whole,
um,
uh,
Cha,

158
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.090
the summaries of the episodes and all this stuff,
he said,
so what's your,

159
00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:45.690
you're on air,
who are you going to be on the show?
And I said,

160
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:48.940
what do you mean it's like a,
I'm just going to be me.
He said,
no,

161
00:09:48.941 --> 00:09:51.840
are you going to be like the funny guy you're going to be?
They're really smart,

162
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:55.410
Pref,
professorial guy.
You know,
what's your image,
your persona going to be?

163
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:57.800
I said,
I'm just going to be me.
He said,
oh you're,

164
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:02.790
you're going to be authentic with with air quotes.
I said,

165
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:06.030
what the fuck is that?
No,
I'm going to be authentic.
He's like,
no.

166
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.120
On TV you can't be really authentic the most.

167
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:14.121
You can be as quote authentic because you have to be the same every fucking

168
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:18.360
episode and if you come in one day and you're feeling pissed off cause you just

169
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:22.790
had a fight with your wife or you know you got diarrhea or whatever the,

170
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.150
whatever your issue is,

171
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.260
you can't express that you have to be the same guy you were last week.

172
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.860
But why is that?
Cause that's just didn't,
well it's entertainment medium.

173
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:37.070
The medium is just so limiting in that way that people expect that every week.

174
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.920
That's the one of the cool things about a podcast is that they kind of don't,

175
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:44.190
like when you do 10,
generally speaking,
you can kind of like,

176
00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:48.060
oh thank you bu nice.
Yeah,
I tried to but,

177
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.170
but still I am conscious of the,

178
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.570
did the distinction between who I really am and who people are getting the

179
00:10:57.571 --> 00:10:58.440
impression I am.

180
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.680
And I try to be like just a last episode I did a,

181
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.720
in the intro I did a little thing about,
um,

182
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.790
cause people were writing to me and saying like,

183
00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:13.791
what's it like to go from like some nobody in Barcelona to Ted talks and Grogan

184
00:11:14.491 --> 00:11:18.990
show and all this stuff.
Right.
What's that like?
Did you like feel it happening?

185
00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:20.490
Did you expect it?
Did you,

186
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.820
is it like being on a river and it was just flowing that way or were you

187
00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:25.100
swimming toward it?
You know,

188
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:30.120
and so I tried to address it a little bit and what I said was in my very

189
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:31.440
minuscule experience,

190
00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:36.441
fame is like wine that tastes really good and can only get you drunk.

191
00:11:36.871 --> 00:11:40.890
Well,
it's in your mouth,
so you swallow it quickly.

192
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.400
I know it's not the best thing.
I think the other metaphor,
I thought it was like,

193
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.480
oh,
I can't.
Okay.
So if it's in your mouth,
it gets you junk,
but if you swallow it,

194
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:53.220
you're fine.
Fine.
Right.
Okay.
So you,
um,

195
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.980
I mean,
you

196
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.830
<v 0>know what I'm talking about.
Someone comes up to you and like,</v>

197
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.440
they're like nervous and like,
oh my God,
it's Joe Rogan,
right?
And you're like,

198
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.900
yeah,
I'm just,
I'm just me.
Right?
I mean,

199
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.120
you know the truth and you're just the guy,

200
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.420
but they're reacting to what they think you are,

201
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:12.070
which is so much more than what you actually,
what anyone is.
You know,

202
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.450
that's the nature of fame.

203
00:12:13.451 --> 00:12:18.450
It's this bullshit thing that only has the value that people apply to it.
Right.

204
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.970
And they're applying more to it than you are because you're,
you.
Right.

205
00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:24.550
And you know what it's like behind the curtain.
So,

206
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.540
but you don't want to disrespect them either.
Right.

207
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.590
And you don't want to disrespect what it is that they're experiencing in that

208
00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:32.410
moment,
even though it's complete bullshit.
Right,
right,
right.

209
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.970
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking.

210
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.960
<v 3>No,
no,
you're making sense.
Cause it,
it,
it's,</v>

211
00:12:36.961 --> 00:12:39.790
it's very confusing to people that don't know it,
but it's,

212
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.930
it's like a magic trick that,
um,
if it tricks the magician,

213
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:48.520
he's a fucking idiot.
You know what I mean?
It's like you have some magic look,

214
00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:51.550
I pull it up out of my hat.
You know,

215
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:54.220
there was no fucking dove and the doves and your sleeve ass hole,

216
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:56.920
you're hiding the dove.
I see what you're doing,
you know what you're doing.

217
00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:57.910
But if you say,

218
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.870
I have this amazing ability to make doves appear out of nowhere and you really

219
00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:04.150
believe it,
well you're a moron.
You know,

220
00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:07.480
it's like you have a magic trick and being on television or being,
you know,

221
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.670
on the radio or in movies or whatever it is,

222
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.860
whatever it is that people get attracted to you by your work,
by your,

223
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.720
by you being an author,
whatever it is,

224
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:21.250
that thing makes you different than another person.

225
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:25.570
Instead of just like,
I appreciate talent,
like very much so,

226
00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:30.070
and I can kind of be like a little star struck when I meet someone that I really

227
00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:34.330
appreciate or that I really am,
uh,
admiring of their work,

228
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.850
but I kind of know what it is.

229
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.820
It's like I've seen it enough times that I will go,
hey,

230
00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:43.780
there's that guy that fucking sings out.
Awesome Song.
Hey,
I love your shit,
man.

231
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.620
It's like,
it's a good thing,
but it's not,
I don't think of them as,

232
00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:48.640
other than a human being.

233
00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:51.820
But I remember one of the first times ever met a famous person or the first

234
00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:53.050
times I ever met famous people.

235
00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:55.480
I couldn't believe I was seeing them in real life.

236
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.990
One of the first guys that ever met,
I was in Harvard Square in Cambridge.

237
00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:00.190
I don't even remember the dude's name,

238
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.000
but he had been in a bunch of like television dramas,
Fleming,
and I was like,

239
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:06.210
you're that guy from that show.
And he like,

240
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.350
tell me what the show is asking a question.
You're like,

241
00:14:08.351 --> 00:14:10.930
want to know what the t stop was?
You know,
we could,
uh,

242
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.260
catch public transportation.
You know,
he approached you.
He just,
he was just,
yeah,

243
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.840
he asked a question,
asked.

244
00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:20.500
I don't know if I asked him if he was that guy first or if he asks me,

245
00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:22.840
but he didn't give a fuck.
He was like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

246
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:25.120
I'm that guy from that show.
Did you guys know where this thing is?

247
00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:28.270
And we told them where it was and like,
wow,
we just saw that guy.

248
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:33.310
I still to this day,
don't remember who the fuck he was.
It's funny.

249
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.870
And when I was little,

250
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.740
my uncle used to work for Howard marks advertising.

251
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.090
My uncle Vinny is a,
an artist and he,
uh,

252
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.240
worked for the company that drew the album covers for kiss.

253
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:50.980
So when I was like Paul,
I guess I was like eight or nine years old maybe,

254
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.040
I don't know how,
somewhere in

255
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.720
<v 2>that age I met,
uh,</v>

256
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.810
ace freely who was the lead guitarist to kiss and he always wore makeup and I

257
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:03.890
met him with no makeup on and uh,
you know,
he would come by and like he,

258
00:15:03.891 --> 00:15:08.150
it was a great hustle.
They had,
they wore makeup when they were on stage,

259
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.090
but then offstage,
no one knew who the fuck they were.

260
00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:16.220
Huge superstar selling out arenas,
stars.

261
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.850
But they were just completely in Cognito others.

262
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.810
So this guy just walks into the office and my uncle knew him because they were

263
00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:26.780
friends and he's like,
Oh hey,
what's up?
How are you doing?

264
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.990
And I was so confused.
I was like,
is that,
is that what he looks like?

265
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.920
Like you can,
cause he couldn't even see them.
Like they,

266
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.900
this was obviously pre internet,

267
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:39.560
but there was no photos of them available without their makeup.

268
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.040
It was like maybe one photo with like a hand in front of them or something like

269
00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:45.050
that.
Well,
you really couldn't see clearly,

270
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:49.400
but to see him in the flesh moving around and walking and talking,
I was like,

271
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:52.520
what the fuck?
I thought about that for years.

272
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.520
It's a pretty cool thing because they,
I mean I don't,

273
00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:59.840
I don't know anything about kiss.
Like if they were in masks from the beginning,

274
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:02.540
like with the makeup from plan clothes and stuff.

275
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:08.000
So like were they anticipating like wow,
if we get famous,
you know,

276
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:10.310
we don't want to be recognized that the whole foods,

277
00:16:10.311 --> 00:16:12.230
like they see that shit come in.

278
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.030
They saw whole foods and trader Joe's.
It's all out there.

279
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.930
I don't think so.
I think there was a style of,

280
00:16:20.931 --> 00:16:22.760
I think they used to call it Glam rock.

281
00:16:22.761 --> 00:16:25.880
Is that what they used to call it with David Bowie and all that?
Yeah,

282
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:29.990
I mean I think that's what it's called,
but I think it was just a hook.

283
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.530
I think their hook was that they were going to wear face paint,
you know,

284
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:37.430
and have these designs in their face.
Like Paul Stanley was the star child,

285
00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:41.330
so he had the star over his face and gene Simmons was the demon used to spit

286
00:16:41.331 --> 00:16:44.510
blood and blow fire on stage and they have,
you know,

287
00:16:44.511 --> 00:16:48.710
Pete or Chris was the cat and the ace freely was,
you know,
he had a,

288
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:53.630
he was like the space man and they have this persona that they had adopted like

289
00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:57.050
these characters and no one knew what they were.

290
00:16:57.051 --> 00:16:59.090
And all their names were fake too.
I'm pretty sure.

291
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:04.480
So like who they were when they were on stage and it was sort of taken even

292
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:10.250
further into fantasy land by this makeup and these crazy costumes that they
wore.

293
00:17:10.251 --> 00:17:14.030
Like they were boots like gene Simmons,
boots had teeth on the bottom of them.

294
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:18.140
Like these.
It's just all so nutty.
So bringing it back to your buddy,

295
00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.040
imagine you know your kiss and you're trying to pick up a woman in a bar and

296
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:25.220
you're like,
you know,
I'm gene Simmons,
the Fuck Outta here.

297
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.800
You probably work at Merrill Lynch.

298
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.260
I think they probably had so many girls coming up to them.

299
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:37.370
They never went to a bar and tried to meet people.
They never went.
Yeah,

300
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:42.430
I mean there was probably just trying to think how many can I fuck in a day and

301
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.620
how many do I have to say no to because it's just not going to work out as you

302
00:17:46.621 --> 00:17:50.020
get tot do that for you.
Probably.
Yeah,
they probably had like

303
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.230
<v 0>handlers,
handlers wranglers.
I heard an interview the other day with,</v>

304
00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:57.900
um,
uh,
I'd have him forget his name,

305
00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:02.610
but he's one of the main guys of iron maiden and a,
which has a band,

306
00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:04.430
I don't know,
but I know they're huge.
Right.

307
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:09.510
And he's a jet pilot and he flew commercial airlines for years.

308
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:14.250
So he was like,
you know,
nobody knew it was me up there,
you know,
and I just be,

309
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.190
you know,
flying,
you know,
London to New York or whatever.

310
00:18:17.191 --> 00:18:20.880
Like this is your pilot and we're reaching out to cruising altitude and then

311
00:18:20.881 --> 00:18:22.620
he'd go like play a Gig in New York.

312
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.960
So he would fly as a commercial air pilot and then do a Gig and then they bought

313
00:18:27.961 --> 00:18:31.980
it jet,
you know,
seven 47 or something to fly the band around.

314
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:35.100
So now he flies the bands to gigs.

315
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.200
How fucking strange didn't John Travolta fly commercially for Quantus?

316
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:44.390
That rings a bell.
Yeah I know he's an accomplished pilot.
Yeah.

317
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.270
I'm pretty sure he did.
A friend of mine went flying with Tom Cruise.

318
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:53.190
He's got like a one of those biplanes stunt plane.
Wow.

319
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:56.550
It was like loop de loop and she said man I almost puked on him cause she was in

320
00:18:56.551 --> 00:18:56.850
front of,

321
00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:01.110
you know the pilots and back and she was like I was this close to to Ralph and

322
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:05.630
all over time.
Great.
So the pilot goes in back and the passengers in front.
Right.

323
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.960
How strange.
Yeah.
Those old planes man.
When you,
it kind of,

324
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.480
when you see what it is,

325
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:17.690
this like wire frame with this like very thin coding outside of its sold.

326
00:19:18.761 --> 00:19:22.110
The cable is going out to the flaps and stuff.
Yeah.

327
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.460
And they used to have to manipulate the flaps with handles in order to make it

328
00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:29.520
go up and down and move on.
Right.
Oh God.

329
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.010
And they fought with those things.

330
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.340
You remember the kink old King Kong King Kong one with a King Kong on top of the

331
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.530
World Trade Center was the World Trade Center was the empire state building back

332
00:19:40.531 --> 00:19:42.540
down.
Lied about the Ham.
Fucking liar.

333
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.350
He's climbing up the empire state building and they're shooting at and went

334
00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:47.230
those planes.

335
00:19:47.231 --> 00:19:52.231
So some old Ricky world war one is pre world war two because King Kong I believe

336
00:19:53.521 --> 00:19:56.330
was the thirties the original case early,

337
00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:00.350
I want to say like 33 or something like that.
It was a talkie,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

338
00:20:00.351 --> 00:20:01.890
It was a tall one.
Early Talkies.

339
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:07.040
We went over that yesterday that the first movies were actually 18 hundreds for

340
00:20:07.861 --> 00:20:11.640
silent movies.
There's late 18 hundreds with the horses.

341
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.530
The first one to show that the horses,

342
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.890
all the horses feet came off the ground at once.
No,
no.
That story.
Yeah.

343
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:21.840
I think that was the first motion picture.
I know a French guy.
Yeah.

344
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.250
There was a bet that it's a long time since I,
I may be full of Shit here,

345
00:20:26.251 --> 00:20:29.580
but I'm sure people are googling it even as we speak,
but there was a,

346
00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:32.690
I think it was the first motion picture was um,

347
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:36.840
that they were trying to determine whether all of the horses feet came off the

348
00:20:36.841 --> 00:20:39.180
ground at once.
So he set up,

349
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.560
I don't know if it was like a bunch of cameras in a bank that sequentially shot,

350
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.830
well,
they have a video of it.
Actually we go an 89 there you go.

351
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.260
Yeah.
And the second frame you can see all the horses feet are off the ground.

352
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:54.603
Yeah.

353
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.840
What was the first movie ever made of the first movie?

354
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:03.610
A Thomas Edison in 1889 oh really?
Thomas Edison.

355
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.420
That's what this is saying.
It's too bad.
He was such a prick.

356
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.620
I apparently he was right.
He stole a Tesla's ideas.
Yeah.

357
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:16.390
It's hard to tell though.
That could be like one big,
he said,
she said thing,

358
00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:19.600
but obviously Tesla was a super genius.

359
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:24.630
N Edison electrocuted a fucking elephant for fun to show to scare people.

360
00:21:25.871 --> 00:21:30.370
Yeah.
Against DC,
which is hilarious.
Well against ACDC,

361
00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.130
against alternating current like DC was what was the standard,
right.

362
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:39.270
And ACDC alternating current was what Tesla had invented so that you could plug

363
00:21:39.641 --> 00:21:42.910
in all sorts of different devices that we need less power.
Oh,

364
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.550
I'm pretty sure the Edison already had a business thing.

365
00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.600
And even though Tesla's idea was better,
more efficient.
Yeah.

366
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.180
Well Tesla was a weird,
weird,
weird guy,
man.

367
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.430
But you kinda have to be,

368
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.030
to be that fucking smart and figure out that many different things.

369
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.590
So that brings us back a little bit to what we were talking about before with

370
00:22:05.591 --> 00:22:07.210
the,
you know,
the persona.
I've,

371
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:12.270
I've got this idea that most of the people who rise to positions of prominence

372
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:18.280
in Western society are troubled in some way.

373
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.660
So like,
you know,
you're talking about geniuses like you,

374
00:22:22.661 --> 00:22:27.370
you have to be a genius is a certain kind of distortion.

375
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.690
Right,
right.
Um,
I think Einstein said that the,

376
00:22:31.691 --> 00:22:36.190
a smart man controls his mind,
did geniuses controlled by it.
Right?

377
00:22:36.191 --> 00:22:38.920
So you're,
there's an obsessive quality to it.

378
00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:44.080
And I wonder if you know,
the extent to which our,
you know,
this,

379
00:22:44.081 --> 00:22:47.530
this is the soul book that I'm writing is it seems that if,

380
00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.970
if you say the underlying structure of civilization is essentially pathological,

381
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.580
then it makes sense that the,
the leaders,

382
00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:58.600
the people who rise to prominent positions within that society will

383
00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:03.850
predominantly be pathological.
Is that necessarily true?

384
00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:07.630
Like is Zuckerberg like a guy who creates something like Facebook?

385
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.780
Is that kind of pathological?
Well,
you know,
you would,

386
00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.270
I would look at him and say,
I don't know the guy.

387
00:23:13.271 --> 00:23:17.300
Of course I just saw the movie that's as close as I got to him.
But uh,

388
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.810
does he seem like a balanced,
uh,

389
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.820
healthy character to me?
You know,

390
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.440
it seems like a lot of,

391
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:31.470
a lot of what's created is created by sexually frustrated adolescent men or boys

392
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.600
and he would probably fit into that area.
You know what I mean?

393
00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:41.200
It wasn't the whole thing like a dating,
a way to meet chicks at Harvard.

394
00:23:41.201 --> 00:23:45.590
Wasn't that the origins of it?
I think it was a dating,
I don't really know.

395
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.460
I don't remember.

396
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.330
<v 2>It was in the movie.
Makes sense though.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So anyway,</v>

397
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:53.420
I read Freud talked about this in civilization and its discontents that

398
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.140
civilization is built on deflected sexual energy.

399
00:23:57.141 --> 00:23:59.390
And if we were all just getting laid as much as we want it,

400
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:02.330
nobody would do anything.
That's,
that's a good point.

401
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:07.331
And also if you really concentrate on what is healthy in quotes was healthy,

402
00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:12.620
his friendship and fun.
None of those really stack up points,

403
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:17.980
you know,
as far as like monetary,
you know,
if you can wait,

404
00:24:17.981 --> 00:24:19.440
you can put in your bank account,
right.

405
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.910
What you can show as far as like your real estate holdings and right.

406
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:26.390
The look at my fancy stuff.
Yeah.
You know,
like that,

407
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:31.010
that's really what people look to when they look for the gauge of success.

408
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:34.370
The gauge of success is almost always attached to money and that's it.

409
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:39.130
And if you get to the point where you see through money or fame or power these,

410
00:24:39.131 --> 00:24:43.730
these Burton,
these metrics that are socially accepted,

411
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.890
then you become,
you know what the Jesus figure,
the Buddha,
the,
you know,

412
00:24:48.891 --> 00:24:53.810
you sorta check out to in turn on drop out.
Right?
Yeah.
And then you're a loser.

413
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.200
You're a loser.
Exactly.
And you're not influencing,
uh,

414
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.340
the direction as society.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's weird.

415
00:25:01.341 --> 00:25:05.750
Like it's weird about our ideas,
like knowing the temporary nature of life.

416
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.080
It's weird that our idea of success is based almost entirely on the possession

417
00:25:12.351 --> 00:25:13.730
of things.
Yeah.

418
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.990
And that of course feeds into the powers that be right.

419
00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:22.910
The consumerist change,
the change in nature into plastic,

420
00:25:22.911 --> 00:25:24.680
you know,
which seems to be what we're about.

421
00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.620
I have a weird theory about this that I've repeated before.

422
00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:32.420
So in interest of saving the,
the attention span of the people that listen,

423
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:37.070
I think that the reason why people are hooked on materialism and the reason why

424
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:40.700
it's so attractive is because ultimately what it's doing is propelling

425
00:25:40.701 --> 00:25:45.320
technology and innovation and that the more we become obsessed with acquiring

426
00:25:45.321 --> 00:25:50.000
the newest,
latest,
greatest things,
the more it will push innovation,
these newest,

427
00:25:50.001 --> 00:25:50.960
latest,
greatest things.

428
00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:55.490
And the reason for that is we're ultimately creating an artificial life.

429
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.900
And I think that we are the technological caterpillar that becomes some

430
00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:01.760
artificial intelligent butterfly.

431
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:06.020
And that what we're doing is creating a new life form.
We just,
we're so,

432
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:08.710
we're so arrogant that we're,

433
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.020
we think that we're the only life and this is the only life it's possible.

434
00:26:12.021 --> 00:26:15.370
But meanwhile,
what we're doing is we,
we,

435
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:19.250
we have been born into these inefficient,
um,

436
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.680
these biological entities,

437
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:27.340
these shells that how's our imagination and that we eventually will escape them

438
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.970
or create something that makes us obsolete more likely.
The latter.

439
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:37.490
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm grappling with these very issues right now at the end of this book.

440
00:26:37.491 --> 00:26:42.200
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Have you ever read a Kevin Kelly or heard of him?
No.
He's,

441
00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:44.220
um,
uh,
very deep

442
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.590
<v 4>thinker and,
and,
um,</v>

443
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.290
artificial intelligence and the Internet and all that kind of stuff.

444
00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:50.570
Very interesting guy.
And,

445
00:26:50.571 --> 00:26:55.571
and systems like how systems self organize and like,

446
00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:58.380
you know,
like,
uh,

447
00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:03.480
they take 'em high speed film of flocks of birds and they see that the

448
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:09.930
individual birds are reacting to other birds.
Um,

449
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.770
the flock is reacting quicker than individual birds can,
can react.

450
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:18.430
There's there,
there's what they call phase change,
um,

451
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:22.500
where you shift from a group of birds to a flock of birds or a bunch of fish to

452
00:27:22.501 --> 00:27:26.460
a school of fish where the,
where everything starts functioning very differently.

453
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:31.290
Right.
And,
um,
like for example,
did you know that uh,

454
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:35.120
locus and grasshoppers are the same animal?
Yeah,
I did.

455
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:40.290
Completely crazy.
That gets to your earlier point.
Yeah.
Well,
yeah,
when,

456
00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:44.760
when it rains and so then there's a lot of food they replicate,
you know,

457
00:27:44.761 --> 00:27:46.440
they reproduce really quickly.

458
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.090
So now you've got the population density and then the food starts to dissipate

459
00:27:51.091 --> 00:27:56.091
because the water is going and now they get very tight population density and

460
00:27:56.401 --> 00:27:59.880
they become locus,
which their brains change,
their legs change,

461
00:27:59.881 --> 00:28:03.600
the coloring changes,
their behavior changes and they start swarming.

462
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.110
So till with less food,
they swarm.
Yeah.
When the,

463
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:11.220
well the food is restricted so they get into,
um,
you know,

464
00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:12.780
like a oasis or something.

465
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:17.530
So they get into smaller areas because the water from the rain,
first it rain,

466
00:28:17.531 --> 00:28:22.230
so you get lots of them,
then the water,
uh,
starts to disappear.

467
00:28:22.231 --> 00:28:27.000
Right.
It evaporates over a few days or whatever,
and the food is less and less.

468
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.130
So they're concentrated and it's when they're packed tightly that they shift

469
00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:35.200
into locus and that's when they swarm and they go out,
you know,

470
00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:36.840
and wipe out anything they can find,

471
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.870
but then they can shift back to grasshoppers again.

472
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:44.970
So I'm sort of arguing in this book that civilization is when our species

473
00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:49.710
shifted to locus of a phase shift into a locust form.

474
00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:52.680
And we swarmed and we've been swarming ever since.

475
00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.510
But we're about to run out of material and you know,

476
00:28:57.511 --> 00:29:00.680
like the fish stocks are down,
the water's gone.
Everything's,

477
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.720
we're in the age of no more.
You know,

478
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:05.230
<v 3>it's hard to argue.
You know,</v>

479
00:29:05.231 --> 00:29:08.440
I was watching this documentary the other day about the 1970s when they were

480
00:29:08.441 --> 00:29:12.460
talking about the 1970s there was 100 million less people in America,

481
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.600
in America and America,
and the world population was aliens.

482
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.290
That's stunning.
Yeah,
100 million.
I mean,

483
00:29:20.291 --> 00:29:23.110
think about if 100 million people died today in America,

484
00:29:23.111 --> 00:29:26.500
it would be a fucking enormous tragedy of epic proportion.

485
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:31.600
But that was just the numbers a few decades ago.
Yeah.
Four decades ago,

486
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:35.320
whatever it was,
you know,
whatever,
you know,
pick a number.
Yeah.

487
00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.200
That's fucking crazy.
That's crazy.

488
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:41.980
To 100 million people is a lot gather in

489
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.570
<v 0>inside of 50 years.
Yeah,
that's,
that's really remarkable.</v>

490
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:48.161
And yeah,

491
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:53.161
and we're still talking as if growth is the natural and you know,

492
00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.890
it's the way to,
it's the only way to be right.
We need growth.

493
00:29:56.891 --> 00:29:59.740
We need growth there.
They're worried that,
uh,

494
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:03.490
reproduction levels are below zero in Japan,

495
00:30:03.491 --> 00:30:06.940
in Spain and some other countries.
Why are we worried?
That's great.
I mean,

496
00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:10.600
short term it's a problem because you don't have enough young people to work and

497
00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:13.760
pay for the old people,
whatever.
But long term,

498
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:18.010
I imagine how great the fucking earth would be if there were 1 billion people on

499
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:18.910
earth.
You know,

500
00:30:18.911 --> 00:30:23.320
that was something that came to Mckenna in a mushroom trip.

501
00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:24.580
He,

502
00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:29.580
he asked the mushroom how to save the human race and they said every couple

503
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:34.720
reproduce only with one child and the human race will be saved.
That's it.

504
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.530
It's all we'd have to do it significantly lower population and you know,

505
00:30:38.531 --> 00:30:42.760
with mortality and accidents and natural causes and all the other jazz take

506
00:30:42.761 --> 00:30:47.320
control.
Actually this is going to be historic.
I am a little,
I,

507
00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.430
I'm at the end of the book,
right where I,

508
00:30:49.431 --> 00:30:53.740
I the publisher requires a prescriptive like what's next?
You know,

509
00:30:53.741 --> 00:30:56.650
what did we do with all of this kind of chapter,
which I hate doing,

510
00:30:56.651 --> 00:30:58.960
but I'm doing it.
You have to like have a,

511
00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:03.610
a solution take away their phrase that they love is what's the takeaway

512
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.800
takeaway?
Got To have a takeaway
that's of a final lap.

513
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.230
Mr. Ryan.
Yeah,

514
00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.430
there's the gun's been on the mantle piece through the whole play.

515
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.230
Somebody's got to get,

516
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:18.600
you can't end the movie like no country for old men or just can't just,

517
00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.740
the guy just wanders off and like,
what the fuck?
Where's the resolution?
Um,

518
00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.590
but you know,

519
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.850
I've been reading Kevin Kelly reading other stuff and I've come around a,

520
00:31:27.851 --> 00:31:31.780
you and Duncan and I have always had this sort of three way debate about the

521
00:31:31.781 --> 00:31:35.800
future of humanity and all that.
And I see three scenarios,

522
00:31:35.801 --> 00:31:40.801
one of which is the one you just outlined where we are a transitional life form

523
00:31:40.931 --> 00:31:45.931
that gives birth to techno intelligence and spreads out into the universe in

524
00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:50.830
whatever.
Um,
and uh,

525
00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:55.860
the another is sort of apocalyptic collapse and mad men.

526
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:59.220
They're not mad,
mad,
Mad Max mad,

527
00:31:59.221 --> 00:32:02.260
but that'll be come advertise different outfits.

528
00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:08.350
I didn't lapels a lot of smoking.
Uh,
and uh,

529
00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.250
but the other one,
which I'm actually,
you know,
if I were a betting man,

530
00:32:12.251 --> 00:32:15.600
I probably wouldn't put my money on this,
but I'm,
I'm,

531
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:20.110
I'm encouraged to think about it.
I read a book recently called future perfect.

532
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:23.890
Uh,
don't remember the author.
Steven Johnson is the author,

533
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.220
another Internet Tech Web guy.
Right.

534
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:31.210
And he makes us a really strong case,
which I've heard you make.

535
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:36.070
You've made it to me actually,
that the Internet is,
first of all,

536
00:32:36.071 --> 00:32:40.040
it's very,
very early days for the Internet and it opens up

537
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.880
<v 4>revolutionary possibilities like beyond anything that's happened to our species</v>

538
00:32:46.821 --> 00:32:47.654
in the past.

539
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:52.220
The fact that you and I right now are talking to hundreds of thousands of people

540
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:56.990
with no sponsor telling us,
don't say that.
Don't say this,
that I can,
you know,

541
00:32:56.991 --> 00:33:00.530
we can talk shit about Monsanto,
we can talk shit about the u s government.

542
00:33:00.531 --> 00:33:04.970
We can do whatever we want.
That is really revolutionary.

543
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:09.740
And the effects of that are impossible for us to really predict.

544
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:15.080
And it's international,
right?
It doesn't respect national borders.
It anyone,

545
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:19.940
anywhere.
It's archived.
It,
you know,
it,
it functions vertically and horizontally.

546
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:21.830
That's really something.

547
00:33:21.831 --> 00:33:25.760
And one of the examples he uses in his book is Kickstarter.

548
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:31.370
In two years after they launched,
Kickstarter was already,

549
00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:36.200
um,
spending more supporting artists than the National Endowment for the arts.

550
00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.770
Wow.
Two years.
And now it's like three times that.

551
00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.260
That's amazing,
right?

552
00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:45.080
Who would have thought that there were so many people who are like,

553
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:49.790
I'll give 20 bucks to that guy.
I'll support that.
And you know,

554
00:33:49.791 --> 00:33:52.850
this just with this technology,
you're able to do stuff.

555
00:33:52.851 --> 00:33:57.160
I was reading about this tribe in the Amazon the other day who are,
um,

556
00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:01.340
basically have taken over defense of their land because of the government's

557
00:34:01.341 --> 00:34:05.180
useless and do so they've got legally they're completely justified,

558
00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:07.190
but the loggers keep coming in and you know,

559
00:34:07.191 --> 00:34:11.710
invading and so they've set up like gps units all around and,

560
00:34:11.711 --> 00:34:14.940
and motion controlled cameras and uh,

561
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:20.050
they're using technology to try to defend their land and document in incursions

562
00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:21.740
and stuff.
And I was thinking like,

563
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:26.960
what did it be cool to set up a crowdfunded thing where you could send 20 bucks

564
00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:32.150
to this tribe in the Amazon to help them buy a fucking motion detected camera or

565
00:34:32.151 --> 00:34:36.260
a drone?
Why not?
Right.
You know about Kiva?
No.

566
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.820
Kiva is micro loans.
Um,

567
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.630
and it's just a website like Kickstarter where you go in Kiva,

568
00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:46.040
you put a hundred bucks in and um,
you,

569
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:50.540
they've got all these people who have applied for loans and you pick a country

570
00:34:50.541 --> 00:34:54.140
El Salvador,
okay.
You go through,
you look at all the pictures and like,
okay,

571
00:34:54.141 --> 00:34:59.141
I need 150 bucks to buy a goat cause I make goat yogurt and sell it in the

572
00:34:59.601 --> 00:35:03.470
village.
Okay,
give her 25 bucks.
She pays it back there.

573
00:35:03.471 --> 00:35:08.471
Their repayment rate is over 99% because they've got people in country who

574
00:35:08.511 --> 00:35:12.320
verify that everything's cool and this is a real thing and whatever.

575
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:17.600
So then the money gets paid back to your account after they get their goat and

576
00:35:17.601 --> 00:35:18.890
they sell enough yogurt and they,

577
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.870
and then you can either take your money out or you can recycle it and like go to

578
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:25.760
Uganda and let's find somebody in Uganda.

579
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:30.761
We can help them put a new roof on the shop rite and it's completely you to

580
00:35:31.011 --> 00:35:34.540
them.
And the,
the company just,
you know,
is that,

581
00:35:34.541 --> 00:35:38.190
it's like Tinder or anything else.
It's,
it's just a way to connect

582
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:43.010
<v 0>really cool.
You know,
and it's your money and if you don't want to do it anymore,</v>

583
00:35:43.011 --> 00:35:44.550
you take your money and you're out.
Yeah.

584
00:35:44.551 --> 00:35:49.551
These sort of non capitalistic ideas are one of the most beautiful things about

585
00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:50.520
the internet.

586
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:55.520
Like these sort of organically created ideas like Kickstarter or crowdfunding

587
00:35:56.290 --> 00:36:01.020
couchsurfing.
Yeah.
You know,
like,
uh,
yeah,
all this sharing economy,
he calls it,

588
00:36:01.021 --> 00:36:03.030
it's,
his term is pure progressive's.

589
00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:07.350
And so then like what's going to happen if,
you know,

590
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:08.670
we can get the,

591
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:12.990
the all the guards out of the way and make Internet direct voting.

592
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:15.570
That's the ultimate future,
right.

593
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:19.380
Internet direct voting where it's not no longer electorial college,

594
00:36:19.381 --> 00:36:21.540
we don't look at things is in terms of states,

595
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:26.610
but we look at terms of the mass of the race or the mass of the human organism.

596
00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:27.960
How does what benefit?

597
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.950
The problem is there's been people that have been candy fed,

598
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:36.600
they'd been baby fed for so long that it's almost like they're,

599
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:40.350
it's like taking a person who's been in solitary confinement,

600
00:36:40.351 --> 00:36:44.700
locked up like a veal and then forcing them to run an ultra marathon.
It's like,

601
00:36:44.701 --> 00:36:48.240
are you just writing?
You're not prepared for this.
You're not conditioned for it.

602
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:53.450
You don't have the resources to pull off a and informed version of the future,

603
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.610
you know?
Yeah.
But you know the,
and again,

604
00:36:59.611 --> 00:37:03.390
it's really weird that I'm the,
I'm arguing the hopeful side here,
but hey,

605
00:37:03.391 --> 00:37:07.910
what the fuck?
We said this is going to be a bullshit.
I ain't [inaudible] lie.

606
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:11.070
We're fucked.
I don't believe any of those.
Um,

607
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:14.700
the one thing I would say about human nature,
cause I get asked a lot,

608
00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:15.990
what's human nature?
You know,

609
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:21.080
I think the strongest thing I can say about human nature is humans want to do

610
00:37:22.201 --> 00:37:25.560
what everyone else is doing.
That's what we're really good at.

611
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:29.180
We're not good at thinking it through,
but like,
oh,
everyone else's killing Jews.

612
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.960
Well I guess I'll kill some Jews then.
You know,

613
00:37:30.961 --> 00:37:33.810
like everyone else hates black people then I hate black people.

614
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:39.810
Gay Marriage is cool.
Okay.
Gay Marriage is cool.
Like,
look how fast that change.

615
00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:43.380
Yeah.
I was going to bring that up when you were talking about the birds,

616
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:48.530
like the birds moving in a flock in a way where they're moving in such harmony

617
00:37:48.571 --> 00:37:51.170
that they couldn't possibly be reacting to each other.
Right.

618
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:55.890
Is that what happens with mob mentality?
I guess so.
Yeah.
And I,
and I think,

619
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:58.140
you know,
in humans it's mob mentality.

620
00:37:58.141 --> 00:38:02.640
It's fan like that hysteria,
Beatles,
the Beatles.

621
00:38:02.641 --> 00:38:06.780
That's what I was thinking.
Yeah.
Like just insanity.
Yeah.
I mean,

622
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:11.130
there is,
you know,
the greater than the sum of its parts,
right?

623
00:38:11.131 --> 00:38:15.720
That phenomenon.
Like there's no,
you know,
I mean,
geese are a different thing,

624
00:38:15.721 --> 00:38:18.750
but most flocks of birds,
there's,
you know,
starlings,

625
00:38:18.751 --> 00:38:22.920
you see doing that thing at night.
There's no leader,
right?
There's nobody saying,

626
00:38:22.921 --> 00:38:24.570
hey,
let's go to the left now and now we're going to,

627
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:28.990
there's no choreography mimics and fish as well.
Right?
Sure.
Fish in,

628
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:33.930
in swarms of locusts.
And in fact,
in one of these books by Kevin Kelly,

629
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.770
um,
he talks about how they were doing the,

630
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:41.680
the artificial,
uh,
the guys who did the Batman,

631
00:38:41.681 --> 00:38:45.010
one of the Batman movies and they were doing the special effects and I guess

632
00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:49.600
they were bats.
There were flocks of bats that they needed to,
um,

633
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.300
replicate on screen.
And they,
they,

634
00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:58.260
they just set up a logarithm where each bat would react to the other bats in,

635
00:38:58.391 --> 00:39:03.310
near it,
in certain,
according to certain,
um,
uh,
variables.

636
00:39:03.311 --> 00:39:04.780
Calculate calculations,

637
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:09.960
and then they just set it loose and it formed a flock.
Oh.

638
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.980
So it's like,
it doesn't even have to be alive.
It just has to have certain,

639
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:19.570
uh,
consistent responses.
Wow.
Yeah.

640
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.900
So what the fuck are we talking about?
Well,

641
00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:25.870
we're talking about human beings that we're moving in a mob mentality,

642
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.450
or do you think that we're a c?
I think,

643
00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:33.120
I think the evidence is that we're a super organism more than,

644
00:39:33.121 --> 00:39:37.430
than we're in an individual.
Yeah.
We'll see what I did in,
in the book.
And,

645
00:39:37.431 --> 00:39:40.690
and you know,
I hope this is making people want to read it when it comes out.

646
00:39:40.691 --> 00:39:43.060
Not like,
yeah,
I already heard all this shit.
But you know,

647
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:45.640
what I did was I started by saying,

648
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.850
your individuality is itself an illusion,
right?

649
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.350
Because 90% of your weight,

650
00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:58.640
once you get the water out is made of no,
no,

651
00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:59.260
not your way.

652
00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:04.260
90% of your DNA of the DNA that can constitutes your body is not your DNA.

653
00:40:05.021 --> 00:40:09.410
It's the DNA of microorganisms that live on an in you.

654
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:14.080
Right?
So I got into the whole,
the,
the whole,
um,
uh,

655
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.980
ecosys intestinal Fonda and you know,
and all that.
Yeah.
And it's,

656
00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:22.600
so you couldn't exist without that.
So each of us is a community,
right?

657
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.310
So,
and then you go to the higher level and it's just the same thing.
You know,

658
00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:31.150
the,
we,
each of us constitutes an organism as well.

659
00:40:31.151 --> 00:40:36.151
We are part of this thing that we can't really see because you know,

660
00:40:36.731 --> 00:40:40.630
we're part of it.
It's,
it's hard to,
it's like fish don't think about water,

661
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.361
you know?
Right.

662
00:40:41.361 --> 00:40:43.930
And it's not considered because we always like to think of ourselves as

663
00:40:43.931 --> 00:40:44.591
individuals,

664
00:40:44.591 --> 00:40:48.700
but the evidence is there that we get insanely lonely when we're by ourselves.

665
00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:51.160
Oh yeah.
I mean,
we can find me.

666
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:54.400
It's the worst thing you can do to someone in jail.
I mean,
it's really crazy.

667
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.930
And if you think about human beings like being isolated and being lonely,

668
00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:03.931
and then the incredible joy that they have when they find civilization or people

669
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.140
like someone alone on a raft,
they're not thinking about while I'm alive,

670
00:41:08.141 --> 00:41:10.900
at least let me just think about my life.
And I know they're like,
fuck,

671
00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:14.230
I got to find people.
I have to find people again.

672
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.110
If you have all the food in the world,
if you're floating around on a boat,

673
00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:20.080
lost at sea,
you're incredibly sad.

674
00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:24.510
Like we have this insane intense need for each other to,

675
00:41:24.511 --> 00:41:28.870
to be a United bonded with each other.
And if we're not,
we're,
we're fucked.

676
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:33.980
Yeah.
We're like,
we're some strange sort of super organism.
I

677
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.910
<v 2>made a,
um,</v>

678
00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:39.010
a video when I had my 2005,

679
00:41:39.011 --> 00:41:44.011
a showtime special and I did this video about flying over the earth.

680
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:46.400
And then if you fly into Los Angeles,

681
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.830
and if you look at the earth as a host for life,
and,
uh,
you know,
our bodies,

682
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:56.720
you could certainly say that our bodies are a host for life because of all the

683
00:41:56.721 --> 00:41:58.070
organisms that we just talked about,

684
00:41:58.071 --> 00:42:00.740
that the fact there's more e coli in your body,

685
00:42:00.741 --> 00:42:04.220
then there are people that have ever lived ever.
I mean,
it's,

686
00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.170
it's amazing and all that stuff is important for life.
Yeah.

687
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:12.520
But when you fly in Los Angeles and you're flying over that just gigantic mass

688
00:42:12.771 --> 00:42:16.730
of cities,
like if the earth is an organism,
will what?
What are people,

689
00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:21.620
what's it looks like a growth like Los Angeles looks like a growth.

690
00:42:21.621 --> 00:42:23.780
It looks like a growth on the super organism,

691
00:42:23.781 --> 00:42:26.780
like mold on a sandwich and if you saw mold on a sandwich,

692
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:32.020
you don't think of individual pieces of mold with individual identities and

693
00:42:32.151 --> 00:42:33.860
personalities.
You just see mold.

694
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:39.610
I think the same thing could be said about human beings that were just so close

695
00:42:40.101 --> 00:42:40.790
to it.

696
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:45.290
We can't see the forest for the trees that we don't see ourselves objective.

697
00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:46.550
We don't go,
oh,
we're,

698
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:50.870
we're one thing or one big thing that's making technology.

699
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:53.000
I mean that's essentially what we are.

700
00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:56.990
One big thing is willing to sacrifice the very fucking air.

701
00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:02.380
The very air that we need to stay alive are willing to black in that shit up in

702
00:43:02.421 --> 00:43:06.020
order to produce,
you know,
in industrial goods.

703
00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:11.820
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
It's interesting.
I hope that's not the way it's going,
but it's sore.</v>

704
00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:14.580
It feels that way.
That's the trajectory we're on at the moment.

705
00:43:14.581 --> 00:43:17.550
What I'm hoping is that the,
the Internet,

706
00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:21.420
I mean I look at the gay marriage thing and a lot of this stuff is,

707
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:23.160
is ugly that happens on the Internet,

708
00:43:23.161 --> 00:43:27.180
but the idea that there is for the first time ever,

709
00:43:27.181 --> 00:43:31.170
the potential for an org,
a species mind,

710
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:33.990
you know,
a species level mind,

711
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:39.470
what's the first thing any conscious mind becomes aware of its own mortality.

712
00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:44.430
So maybe maybe what's happening is as the,

713
00:43:44.431 --> 00:43:49.431
these synapses are connected for the first time ever and there's this super mind

714
00:43:49.711 --> 00:43:51.030
for a super organism.

715
00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:56.540
It becomes aware of what is what it's doing and suddenly it's like fuck,

716
00:43:57.001 --> 00:44:01.530
stop this.
This is crazy.
This is crazy.
We're killing ourselves.

717
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:06.570
If we can understand that at a species level then we can change it.
Right?

718
00:44:06.571 --> 00:44:10.710
I mean we,
the the passive technologies there,
we all know how to,
you know,

719
00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.440
anal sex is better,
you know,

720
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.760
let's make anal sex the way to no more reproduction.

721
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.710
Let's all go.
I'm not going to talk about it

722
00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:25.440
<v 2>fucking crazy.
Well no I know,
I know what you're saying.
Yeah.</v>

723
00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:31.310
I think the idea non reproductive sex sodomy is where it's at.

724
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:35.660
You saw tummies where it taught be a good teacher.
It's a lot.

725
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:37.800
There's a lot of protein and come to you know,

726
00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:40.890
doesn't necessarily have to eat chickens by the way.
You were,

727
00:44:40.891 --> 00:44:44.450
I saw your Ronda Rousey interview.
Yeah.
And you,

728
00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:47.610
you really funny you said the,
what is it with lipstick,
you know,

729
00:44:47.611 --> 00:44:51.600
it's like right here.
This is where the Dick goes,
right?
I was thinking,
you know,

730
00:44:51.601 --> 00:44:56.130
that is why and how lipstick was invented.
Egyptian hookers,

731
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:57.820
you know that it was hookers.
Yeah.

732
00:44:57.821 --> 00:45:02.540
It was Egyptian hookers to advertise that they specialized in blow jobs.
Wow.

733
00:45:02.541 --> 00:45:05.490
So if you saw hooker with a red lips is like,
she's uh,

734
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.960
she's the blowjob specialist.
Wow.
How do we know that?
Was that written somewhere?

735
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.780
Probably Hieroglyphics.
You know,
I,
I trust the,

736
00:45:12.781 --> 00:45:15.960
I read it in the history of sex by somebody or other,

737
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:19.800
we lost so much of what Egypt was all about and they burned the library of

738
00:45:19.801 --> 00:45:22.960
Alexandria.
He's lost.
It's incredible because if you,

739
00:45:22.961 --> 00:45:25.530
if you see what they were able to accomplish,

740
00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:30.740
so much of what archeologists and historians do when they go back and they look

741
00:45:31.591 --> 00:45:33.380
at what Egypt,
what they were accomplishing,

742
00:45:33.381 --> 00:45:38.381
it's like we're trying to figure out why and how the fuck all this stuff was

743
00:45:38.911 --> 00:45:42.450
done.
You know what I mean?
All they have is what's left on the walls.

744
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.880
It's so crazy.
All they have,

745
00:45:44.881 --> 00:45:49.440
literally they have the Rosetta stone and they have the hieroglyphs and they

746
00:45:49.441 --> 00:45:50.190
have the,

747
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:55.100
the architecture and then they have to try to like back engineer and decipher to

748
00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:58.290
this day there's like a dozen different theories about how they built the

749
00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:02.040
pyramids.
They just really just guesswork.
It's not aliens.

750
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:05.160
I thought it was aliens.
I don't think that's true.
I don't either.

751
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:10.370
I think it's much more likely the advanced civilization a rise and decline is

752
00:46:10.531 --> 00:46:14.940
much more likely.
And as,
um,
as we're learning more about geologic,

753
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.680
uh,
our,
our,
our,
uh,

754
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:21.240
catastrophes as we're learning more about a asteroidal impacts and things along

755
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:22.074
those lines,

756
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.860
it's way more likely that what you're looking at when you're looking at a lot of

757
00:46:25.861 --> 00:46:29.550
the ancient structures that exist that we can't totally explain was that

758
00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:33.840
something happened that like civilization had reached a very high level and then

759
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:38.190
probably were hit by giant rocks from space and very few people survived.

760
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:43.170
But the people that did survive sort of re figured out all the things over a

761
00:46:43.171 --> 00:46:46.350
course of a few thousand years,
just like we have.
I mean,

762
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.470
you go back a thousand years ago,
okay,
let's just go a thousand years ago,

763
00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:55.380
go back to 1015 people were apes.
I mean,

764
00:46:55.381 --> 00:46:59.550
you're talking about like Genghis Khan,
they're riding horses.
No one's got a car,

765
00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:02.760
this shooting arrows at each other.
No one's got guns.
I mean,
this,

766
00:47:02.761 --> 00:47:06.300
you're talking about craziness.
You're talking about a crazy part of the world.

767
00:47:06.301 --> 00:47:07.740
They have catapults and shit.

768
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:11.100
That was what the world was just a thousand years ago.

769
00:47:11.101 --> 00:47:16.101
So in a thousand years we've gone from Gingiss con to fa,

770
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.280
Elon Musk making Teslas.

771
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:23.850
It's Great Kangaskhan to Elan Musk thousand years and we had essentially a

772
00:47:23.851 --> 00:47:28.530
thousand years.
So Magine what we're talking about when the like,
um,

773
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.980
I've had Randall Carlson on my

774
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.270
<v 3>podcast who is a fascinating guy who is absolutely obsessed with asteroidal</v>

775
00:47:34.271 --> 00:47:37.600
impacts and he studied them his entire life and as time has gone on,

776
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:42.100
more and more of his work has been vindicated,
especially by core samples.

777
00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:47.410
He believes that there is enough proof that the stone that the ice age ended

778
00:47:48.521 --> 00:47:49.900
because of asteroidal impacts.

779
00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.330
And he had thought this way before they had figured out this stuff call,

780
00:47:53.331 --> 00:47:56.280
I think it's called Triton night.
They found evidence of a,

781
00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:59.710
what they call nuclear glass,
all throughout Europe and Asia.

782
00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.980
And it all is around 12,000 years ago.

783
00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:07.240
It's all around the same time the ice age ended and he thinks it was the

784
00:48:07.241 --> 00:48:12.241
catalyst for the end of the ice age and probably wiped out a gigantic chunk of

785
00:48:12.431 --> 00:48:17.431
humanity that there was just massive asteroidal impacts all over the planet.

786
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:22.090
And that the just fucking killed almost everybody or a huge percentage and

787
00:48:22.091 --> 00:48:26.110
everybody who's left sort of how to refigure out how to make buildings where we

788
00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:30.010
figure out how to engineer society.
And then they were left with the skeletons,

789
00:48:30.011 --> 00:48:32.620
the architectural skeletons of the past.
You know,

790
00:48:32.621 --> 00:48:35.380
they would look at Stonehenge or look at,
you know,
uh,

791
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.960
go Beckley Tapi or any of these giant ancient structures and go,

792
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:42.610
what the fuck was,
what's this all about?
Who did this,
how'd they do this?

793
00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:45.250
And they would try to mimic it or create their own.

794
00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.180
And that what you're looking at when you look at many of these ancient

795
00:48:49.181 --> 00:48:49.781
structures,

796
00:48:49.781 --> 00:48:54.781
it's just whatever would be left when a giant chunk of civilization is wiped

797
00:48:55.451 --> 00:48:56.590
down.
People have to start all over,
right?

798
00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:00.900
<v 0>Yeah.
Ever read a book called the world without us.
I've heard of it.</v>

799
00:49:00.901 --> 00:49:02.030
It didn't read it.
It's a good book.

800
00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.290
It's basically taking that same thought pattern and applying it to now.

801
00:49:06.291 --> 00:49:10.040
So what would happen if people all disappeared right now?

802
00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:13.820
And so he,
he talked to engineers in New York for example.
Like,

803
00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:17.420
so what would happen,
like right now,
nobody there,
no people.
What would happen?

804
00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:17.901
Well,

805
00:49:17.901 --> 00:49:21.860
the pumps would stop and there are all these pumps that keep water out of this,

806
00:49:21.861 --> 00:49:26.360
the substructure of Manhattan.
Right.
So then that fills up with water.
Okay.

807
00:49:26.361 --> 00:49:29.440
Then how long does it take for the,
the,
um,
uh,

808
00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:34.520
anchors and the skyscrapers to rot or rust away and corrode?

809
00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:37.610
So the skyscape or start falling.
And so he figures all that out.

810
00:49:37.611 --> 00:49:42.611
Like what animals would go feral and survive versus dogs or fuck that all dogs

811
00:49:42.651 --> 00:49:46.900
would be eaten.
Like immediately.
Cats would survive though.
Oh yeah.

812
00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.430
<v 3>What about feral dogs?
Like they have,</v>

813
00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.980
there's populations of feral dogs that exist even in America today.
Like,
yeah,

814
00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:56.940
they killed some old couple.
I guess they'd beat George.
That makes sense.

815
00:49:57.210 --> 00:50:00.550
Better predators,
right?
Yeah.
More adapted.

816
00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:03.780
Probably damage is done left.
Yeah.

817
00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:09.590
I met a guy in Colorado that is a professional mountain mine hunter and uh,

818
00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:14.310
they get hired,
uh,
oftentimes,
like whether or not you knew it.

819
00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:18.840
California employees,
professional mountain lion killers.
Wow.

820
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:23.870
Because they don't have a hunting season on mountain lions in Colorado or in a

821
00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:28.310
California rather in Colorado they do.
And they,
the the,

822
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.210
the wildlife organization,
they measure the population,

823
00:50:32.211 --> 00:50:37.211
the calculated and they decide how many would be viable to take to keep the

824
00:50:37.611 --> 00:50:38.750
community of them healthy,

825
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:42.530
but to protect the elk population and the deer population.

826
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:46.310
And so then they adjust accordingly and they release tags and tags with the

827
00:50:46.311 --> 00:50:48.950
hunters used to go out and legally kill these animals.

828
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:52.340
Well California doesn't have that.
So in California they have,

829
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:57.430
I think he said three different guys that kill an indeterminate amount of

830
00:50:57.501 --> 00:50:59.450
mountain lions and he trouble mountain lions.

831
00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:03.050
They have all throughout California they just travel around and kill these

832
00:51:03.051 --> 00:51:08.051
fucking things because if you don't then they overpopulate and then they become

833
00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:13.130
a problem with dogs and people and joggers and shit like that.

834
00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:18.550
But there's groups in California in particular like extreme wildlife advocates

835
00:51:18.831 --> 00:51:22.160
that want,
that they want no more hunting.

836
00:51:22.161 --> 00:51:26.210
And what they want to do is reintroduce wolves and grizzly bears to California

837
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:31.580
so that those animals control all the game populations to a sufficient level,

838
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:33.050
which is a really,
like,

839
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:36.800
it's not very well thought out because then no one controls their population

840
00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:38.210
except assassins.

841
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:42.260
They have to hire assassins to go out and kill the grizzly bears that start

842
00:51:42.261 --> 00:51:46.400
encroaching into civilization and the wolves and start moving in on people's

843
00:51:46.401 --> 00:51:49.290
livestock.
They have to hire people to kill them.
But it's,

844
00:51:49.291 --> 00:51:54.160
this is fascinating idea of a animal management that these,

845
00:51:54.161 --> 00:51:56.730
these people are like juggling back and forth with machine.

846
00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.870
The people that are pro hunting and then the people that are,
um,

847
00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:03.890
the conservationists or the wildlife advocates.
It's really fascinating stuff.

848
00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:08.140
<v 0>Yeah.
You remind me of something I just read recently about the Cobra effect.</v>

849
00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:08.801
It's called,

850
00:52:08.801 --> 00:52:13.801
it refers to the unintended consequences of trying to control wild animals.

851
00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:20.020
And it started when the British were in India,
in New Delhi.
Uh,

852
00:52:20.021 --> 00:52:23.650
the local authorities decided to deal with the fact that there were all these

853
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:27.280
cobras living in the sewers and you know,
causing a big problem.

854
00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:32.580
So they instituted a price for each dead Cobra that you would bring in and

855
00:52:32.891 --> 00:52:36.100
they'd pay you a bounty.
Right?
So that worked really well.

856
00:52:36.101 --> 00:52:37.510
They were getting rid of a lot of cobras.

857
00:52:37.511 --> 00:52:40.160
Then people started breeding them to make money.
Absolutely.

858
00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:44.140
So suddenly there are all these covers coming in and they realize they're being

859
00:52:44.141 --> 00:52:47.290
played.
So then they're like,
fuck that.
And they stopped paying the bounty.

860
00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:50.560
So now the breeders have thousands of Cobra as you know.

861
00:52:50.561 --> 00:52:52.360
And so just let them loose.
Oh Jesus.

862
00:52:52.361 --> 00:52:55.490
So you end up with a much bigger problem than you thought you were resolving.

863
00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:56.800
Well,
Australia has done that yet Matt

864
00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.050
<v 3>to Australia had a problem with,
uh,
they,</v>

865
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:04.730
Australia didn't really have large mammals.
Uh,
or rather,

866
00:53:04.731 --> 00:53:07.220
I'm a New Zealand didn't really have large mammals,

867
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.750
but Australia introduced certain predators to try to deal with,

868
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:16.100
introduced animals like rabbits,
right?
Like they introduced rabbits to Australia,

869
00:53:16.101 --> 00:53:18.710
but they didn't have natural predators.
So they brought over foxes.

870
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:23.750
And then the Fox is eight a shitload of rabbits and then got out of control and

871
00:53:23.751 --> 00:53:26.160
started eating ground nesting birds and decimating

872
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.140
<v 0>the population of ground nesting me.
You can't tell,</v>

873
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.490
you can't engineer a fox to only eat rabbits.
Right.

874
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.230
But they never did get ahold of the rabbit population.
The rat,

875
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:38.880
they put up fences to try to stop the rabbits from moving into new areas,

876
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:40.140
but they weren't quick enough.

877
00:53:40.141 --> 00:53:43.500
And the rabbits got through the fences as they were building the fences.

878
00:53:43.501 --> 00:53:47.250
The rabbits fucked their way through to the other side of the fences and just

879
00:53:47.251 --> 00:53:48.930
fucked and made more and more rabbits.

880
00:53:48.931 --> 00:53:51.630
And then they wanted to introduce a fox is over there and then they wanted to

881
00:53:51.631 --> 00:53:54.120
bring in predators to kill off the foxes.

882
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:59.190
Like it's a cluster fuck of human beings trying to somehow or another managed

883
00:53:59.191 --> 00:54:01.530
nature and every time he gets away.
Yeah,

884
00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.780
true predators and especially things like,

885
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:08.100
like a rabbit that can just breed like crazy in an environment where they,

886
00:54:08.101 --> 00:54:10.680
you know,
they did really didn't have a natural enemy.

887
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:15.720
There's a great documentary called cane toads about the same thing in Australia

888
00:54:15.721 --> 00:54:18.030
where they,
there is some grub that was eating,

889
00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:22.410
they're destroying sugar cane and in Hawaii they're able to grow sugar.

890
00:54:22.411 --> 00:54:23.244
And the,

891
00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:28.250
the Grub is under control because they have these big toads that eat the grub.

892
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:33.510
So they brought the cane toads to Australia and introduce them.
And these toads,

893
00:54:33.511 --> 00:54:35.730
they're like that big.
They're,
they're,
I mean,

894
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:40.720
they're like the size of a 16 ounce steak,
you know,
they're massive.
Great.

895
00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:45.270
What a fucking,
that's a frog and they're everywhere or,

896
00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.730
and they've just like gone crazy.

897
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:52.731
And the movie is really funny because it's like these people in their encounters

898
00:54:52.801 --> 00:54:56.400
with these cane toads and they're Australian,
so they're just naturally funny.

899
00:54:56.401 --> 00:55:00.990
And can you eat them?
No,
no.
But they do have boof Latina.
If you look at them,

900
00:55:00.991 --> 00:55:04.650
you can get really high.
Ah,
but if your dog bites one,

901
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:09.780
kill your dog and wow.
Yeah,
there.
So,
yeah.
Yeah,

902
00:55:09.781 --> 00:55:12.960
it's it.
I Dunno man.
It,
it makes you think like,
you know,

903
00:55:12.961 --> 00:55:15.890
the whole super organism idea is one of those.
There you go,
look at that thing.

904
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:20.880
It's bigger than a steak fucking price that it's so big.

905
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:26.130
It's so big.
It does.
It looks like I like a,
a large bass.

906
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:29.670
And the movies,
so funny,
it opens,
there's this scene,

907
00:55:29.671 --> 00:55:33.690
it's like early morning and the,
the,
the fog is sort of,

908
00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:38.250
it's foggy hillside and there's a road and you see this van coming down the road

909
00:55:38.251 --> 00:55:40.030
and it sort of swerving around.

910
00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:45.050
It really is swerving around and gradually realized that he's running over as

911
00:55:45.271 --> 00:55:49.320
many cane toads as he can and they're all over the road and he's like,

912
00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:53.730
he's hitting these gains and he talks about how if you hit it just right where

913
00:55:53.731 --> 00:55:57.750
like where it's facing the van and you seal its mouth,

914
00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:02.500
it pops and there's this big explosion,
right?

915
00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:07.050
Yeah.
I have so many of them that they just run over him and the road,

916
00:56:07.051 --> 00:56:08.250
they're everywhere,
man.
And they,

917
00:56:08.251 --> 00:56:11.730
and it's the same thing as you were talking about.
They don't eat the grubs,

918
00:56:11.731 --> 00:56:14.490
they eat everything else.
They might state rats,

919
00:56:14.491 --> 00:56:17.690
they eat all sorts of shit and they have no natural predators and they're

920
00:56:17.691 --> 00:56:20.520
poisoned and they're poisoning.
That's out of control.

921
00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:24.130
And what's the proposal to try to manage

922
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:25.480
<v 2>that?
I don't know what they're doing now.</v>

923
00:56:25.481 --> 00:56:30.481
I saw this movie like 20 years ago at the Margaret Mead Film Festival in New

924
00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:34.420
York and I've lost track of the cane toad issue since then.
I'm sure.

925
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.300
Do you know what happens with rabbits at every seven years?

926
00:56:37.301 --> 00:56:39.730
Rabbits have a die off.
Oh really?
Yeah.

927
00:56:39.731 --> 00:56:44.530
Rabbits apparently all like farmers and ranchers who tell you they go in these

928
00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.640
great cycles,

929
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:50.650
these seven year cycles and right now the population and a lot of areas is very

930
00:56:50.651 --> 00:56:50.801
high.

931
00:56:50.801 --> 00:56:53.860
Where I was in Colorado th this is where the guy was explaining you were just

932
00:56:53.861 --> 00:56:58.320
there like two days ago or something.
Yeah.
And the guy who I was with,
um,
he,

933
00:56:58.370 --> 00:57:02.380
he explained it to me,
but I had heard it from a few people before that um,

934
00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:06.280
their populations get extremely high and then a disease comes along and wipes

935
00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:08.290
them out and it's clockwork.

936
00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:13.350
It happens every seven years and then you find very few rabbits and then seven

937
00:57:13.541 --> 00:57:15.460
years later it will be a swarm again.

938
00:57:15.461 --> 00:57:19.450
It just takes a few years for them to rebuild back up and then their back.

939
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:21.280
And then the same thing happens again.

940
00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:23.920
A new disease kicks along and maybe the same disease,
I don't know.

941
00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:29.340
But the cycle of die offs of a great population growth and die offs.

942
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.910
And this guy was arguing that I was hanging out with in Colorado.
He was saying,

943
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.841
you know,

944
00:57:34.841 --> 00:57:39.160
it's quite likely that what we're looking at is a natural cycle and that it

945
00:57:39.161 --> 00:57:43.570
could be applied to the human race as well.
Yeah,
there's a beautiful book,

946
00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:47.260
which I've recommended many times called a short history of progress by Ronald,

947
00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:50.720
right.
Canadian scientists and it,

948
00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:55.270
he looks at every civilization that's existed.
Uh,
you know,

949
00:57:55.271 --> 00:58:00.220
the Mayans,
the Sumerians,
a,
the Romans,
the Easter island,

950
00:58:00.221 --> 00:58:04.870
all these different civilizations and he shows that they all follow the same

951
00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:08.050
lifecycle.
It's exactly what you're saying,

952
00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:13.051
that there's an organic rise and then there are certain conditions that happen

953
00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:18.010
that just naturally one follows the next and then the decline.
And you know,

954
00:58:18.011 --> 00:58:22.390
you see it happen again and again and again.
Yeah.
It's like the,
the,
the tide,

955
00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:23.900
you know,
it's in the town.

956
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:29.290
It seems to be like a cycle that exists just in almost everything in nature that

957
00:58:29.291 --> 00:58:30.124
there's,

958
00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:35.280
there's some sort of a balancing factor that occurs with any system where you

959
00:58:35.501 --> 00:58:40.240
get an accumulation of one particular species or one particular thing and then

960
00:58:40.241 --> 00:58:43.150
it dies off and then it comes back.
And I mean,

961
00:58:43.151 --> 00:58:46.840
it could be argued that that's what the asteroid will impact is that it's some

962
00:58:46.841 --> 00:58:49.540
sort of an,
an inoculation from space.
Well,

963
00:58:49.541 --> 00:58:54.350
and also life apparently came from asteroids.
Yeah.
So Burmese.
Yeah.
Yeah,

964
00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:58.060
exactly.
The theory that the building blocks of life,
like simple life,

965
00:58:58.061 --> 00:59:02.020
like the amino acids and all those things came by stars.

966
00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:04.480
And then when you find out that a human being really,

967
00:59:04.481 --> 00:59:08.800
essentially it's made out of star dust,
in order to have carbon based life forms,

968
00:59:08.801 --> 00:59:12.200
you have to have a star explode.
You're going to start singing it.

969
00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:16.710
So it's too crazy,
man.
I started,
uh,
um,

970
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:21.500
it's a fucking shit.
Joni Mitchell.
Yeah.
There's a bunch of them.
Yeah.

971
00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:22.910
Um,
by the way,

972
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:27.940
while we're talking about carbon and got to get back with regard to the guy.

973
00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:34.280
Yeah.
Crosby stills Nash yesterday.
What was his name of that song?

974
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:39.290
Uh,
Woodstock,
Woodstock at the time we got to Woodstock.

975
00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:42.890
We are starting to us.
We are gold and we are a billion year old carbon.

976
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:46.400
We've got to get our way back to the garden.
It's a beautiful song.
It was,

977
00:59:46.401 --> 00:59:50.240
they were hippies.
I loved their son.
Acid.
Dirty feet.

978
00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:52.790
Love the one you're with.
Yeah,
that's a good one.
Uh,

979
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:57.710
it's the theme song to sex at dawn.
It should like,

980
00:59:57.711 --> 01:00:00.170
you should get a CD with the book or something.
It's funny,

981
01:00:00.171 --> 01:00:03.010
I've met quite a few girls who have read your book and uh,

982
01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.870
when they do read your book,
there's one of two reactions.

983
01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:08.540
One reaction is fuck that guy.

984
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:12.350
And then the other reaction is it's time to be a Ho.

985
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.130
It's time to just go out and get your freak on.

986
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:19.340
I was talking to this comic like couple of weeks ago and she was saying,

987
01:00:19.341 --> 01:00:24.290
if you're a read this book,
it's called sex at dawn.
I go,
yeah,
I go to authors,

988
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.830
a good friend of mine,
and she goes,
fucking so right.

989
01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:31.970
It's so right in that immediate like,
oh,
there's a Frigo.
She's a freak.

990
01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.270
Like finally somebody gave her her freak license.
Exactly.

991
01:00:35.271 --> 01:00:39.250
Somebody came along with a phd next to his name and said,
it's okay.

992
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:43.340
Do what you do.
It's all right.
Oh Man.

993
01:00:43.341 --> 01:00:47.270
I've gotten so many beautiful emails from women.
Um,
you know,

994
01:00:47.271 --> 01:00:48.380
I've gotten some anger he wants to,

995
01:00:48.381 --> 01:00:52.490
but some really beautiful ones from women who say,
you know,
like,

996
01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:56.090
and even some of the most moving ones are the ones where they say like,

997
01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.350
I get my mom now.
You know,
that's what really touches me.
You know,

998
01:01:00.351 --> 01:01:04.940
like I get it all right.
She wasn't bad.
She just liked to fuck,

999
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:09.620
you know,
and not funny.
And in those days that was a big problem.
You know,

1000
01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:14.270
it's a weird thing that we,
we have such a conflicted relationship with.

1001
01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:17.120
On one hand,
we sell everything with sex.

1002
01:01:17.121 --> 01:01:22.121
We use it to sell cars and fucking houses and everything is so much so that a

1003
01:01:24.561 --> 01:01:26.720
normal look for a woman,

1004
01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:30.860
normal in a business environment is exposed legs.

1005
01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:36.020
Just think about what kind of a business environment would it be of men walked

1006
01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:40.970
around with thongs.
It wouldn't exist.
I mean it'd be like the fuck are you doing?

1007
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:45.890
Men had like little short skirts that they wore to work where your cock was
just,

1008
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:49.550
you could just lift up the shirt,
the skirt and your cock would be right there.

1009
01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:51.620
That that's not acceptable.

1010
01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:56.740
But we women are so desirable and sex is so desirable that we have accepted this

1011
01:01:58.911 --> 01:02:03.911
idea that a woman's attire could be like the easiest possible thing to fucking

1012
01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:09.470
like literally panties that you just pulled to the side and a skirt.

1013
01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:12.890
You just lift up easy accidents on fun high heels,

1014
01:02:12.891 --> 01:02:17.480
which flips your rear entry,
you know,
and I'll draw what's a bra,

1015
01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.100
you know?
I mean it's like here it is.
It's

1016
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.920
<v 0>a tit show,
tits shelf.
It's,
yeah,</v>

1017
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:26.420
this letting everybody know it's right here.
Come and get it.

1018
01:02:26.421 --> 01:02:29.220
And yet on the other side,
you know,
there,
you know,
and,

1019
01:02:29.221 --> 01:02:31.870
and none of this is to say that women,
uh,

1020
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:35.880
should buy into this if they don't want to or that,
you know,
uh,

1021
01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:40.290
objectifying,
I mean,
objectifying is a,
is a complicated thing.

1022
01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:44.700
I think we all objectify constantly.
Um,
but you know,
like this guy,

1023
01:02:44.701 --> 01:02:48.000
there's a big controversy.
A week or so ago,
some guy,

1024
01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:52.350
a woman sent in a lawyer in England sent,
uh,

1025
01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:57.630
tried to contact a senior lawyer in,
in this firm through Linkedin,

1026
01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:02.730
uh,
to get a job.
And he wrote back and said,
well,
we don't have a job right now,

1027
01:03:02.731 --> 01:03:04.800
but I'll tell you your photo is stunning and you know,

1028
01:03:04.801 --> 01:03:06.300
I'm sure you'll have lots of success.

1029
01:03:06.301 --> 01:03:11.301
And so then she calls him out for sexual exploitation because he said her photo

1030
01:03:11.761 --> 01:03:16.530
was stunning.
That was it.
That's just a compliment.
Yeah.
Is that all he said?

1031
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.340
He didn't like,
not,
not like,
let's have dinner,
nothing.

1032
01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:24.990
Just like your photos thing.
So it became this big deal.
And,
uh,

1033
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:29.070
and the guy like,
you know,
half the people are saying the guy's a creep,
you know,

1034
01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:32.250
and I'll take creep shaming is an interesting thing.

1035
01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:37.830
Like if you're over 50,
you should never,
you shouldn't be sexual.

1036
01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:41.610
You shouldn't be sexual.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You like a 30 year old girl,
you piece of shit.

1037
01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:46.290
You're a pedophile.
Oh,
you creep.
She's 22.
Why would you be attracted to her?

1038
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:49.680
She's a babe.
You Woody Allen,
you discuss,

1039
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.860
you disgust me with your sexual desire.

1040
01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:57.850
A fucking Cialis induced heart on fuck you.
Speaking of,

1041
01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.960
speaking of,
uh,
standing up for people,

1042
01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:04.690
I really appreciated the article you wrote recently.
It,

1043
01:04:04.691 --> 01:04:09.330
where's the men's men's life for?
I don't know about hope.
Some maximum.

1044
01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.450
That was really nicely done,
man.
Thanks man.
Seriously,

1045
01:04:12.451 --> 01:04:16.760
as a guy who's not in great shape,
I appreciate it.
That,
yeah,
the,

1046
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:21.300
the concept,
what they wanted me to write something about the human body,
uh,

1047
01:04:21.301 --> 01:04:22.860
about getting in shape or whatever,

1048
01:04:22.861 --> 01:04:27.720
and it just occurred to me to make the comparison to a human body and sand

1049
01:04:27.721 --> 01:04:29.790
castles and your body's like a sand castle.

1050
01:04:29.791 --> 01:04:33.150
That the reason why sand castles are kind of cool is because you know that

1051
01:04:33.151 --> 01:04:37.530
they're not going to last.
Yeah.
It was really well done.
And it's,
I mean it,

1052
01:04:37.531 --> 01:04:40.500
it called the Mandela,

1053
01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:44.550
the idea of building something beautiful that's going to be washed away as soon

1054
01:04:44.551 --> 01:04:47.580
as you get done with it.
I often think about life that way.

1055
01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:51.630
Not physically so much,
but um,
like I feel,
I,

1056
01:04:51.631 --> 01:04:55.560
I'm in my mid fifties now and I feel like I'm starting to figure it out.
Yeah.

1057
01:04:55.561 --> 01:04:59.190
That is part of the problem.
Right.
By the time you realize the hustle,

1058
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:00.990
the fucking game was almost done.

1059
01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:05.950
It's like I'm learning how to dance and they're turning the lights on sort of.

1060
01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:10.080
Probably also what contributed to all these fucked up civilizations was the

1061
01:05:10.081 --> 01:05:13.920
people and they lived to be like 30,
you know,
if you were really lucky.

1062
01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:18.310
So you're just constantly on momentum like running where you couldn't stop.

1063
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:19.900
<v 2>I go,
ah,</v>

1064
01:05:20.090 --> 01:05:23.980
and then the barbarian hordes cut your head off and then hopefully along the way

1065
01:05:23.981 --> 01:05:28.090
you fucked and left behind some of your genes and then they fucked up and people

1066
01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:30.550
just died off in these giant chunks.

1067
01:05:30.551 --> 01:05:34.430
When rats came into your cities have carried fleas,
it had the play.

1068
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:41.850
And then finally we developed the ability to fight off diseases and Nakia late

1069
01:05:42.311 --> 01:05:47.210
ourselves from certain viruses,
uh,
build up walls to keep out the barbarians,

1070
01:05:47.211 --> 01:05:51.070
build up buildup stockpiles of food so that we didn't have to constantly hunt

1071
01:05:51.071 --> 01:05:53.060
and gather.
And then everybody went,
hmm,

1072
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:57.070
I think if you make something circular,
we can roll it.

1073
01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.000
I'm going to call it a wheel.

1074
01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.850
And then they started pushing things along and then they start,
I mean,

1075
01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:06.090
you could argue that that agriculture and that civilization was the downfall.

1076
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:11.200
But you could also argue it was the beginning of real thought.

1077
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:14.890
It was the beginning of relaxed thought because you had the opportunity to

1078
01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:18.490
innovate well and you had the surplus of food that you could have people who

1079
01:06:18.491 --> 01:06:19.960
thought for a living.
Yeah.

1080
01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:23.710
And then the machines slowly started to plot our demise.

1081
01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:27.130
They started with the guiltless listening.
I could be a wheel man.

1082
01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:31.810
I can carry you to put anything,
make life easier for you.
Hey Dude.
You know,

1083
01:06:31.811 --> 01:06:36.790
if you just fucking make a silo,
you can put all your grain in the silo.
Yeah,

1084
01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:41.230
exactly.
You have stockpiles.
Next thing you know you've got Steve Jobs.
Oh yeah.

1085
01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:41.740
Let me,

1086
01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:45.940
I mean I remember in the must have been the 80s when my boss gave me a beeper

1087
01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:50.230
and I was like,
oh cool.
I get a beeper now and within two days it's like,

1088
01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:53.950
you might as well put a fucking leash around my neck.
You know?
It's like,

1089
01:06:53.951 --> 01:06:56.590
this isn't helping me.
This is for you.
You fuck.

1090
01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.890
How about people that are required to answer emails over the weekends?

1091
01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:05.340
There's a lot of jobs that you're required to answer emails at night over the

1092
01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:08.290
weekend.
You have to constantly be aware and you have to have your funders.

1093
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.800
There are certain companies that require people that are employees to have their

1094
01:07:11.801 --> 01:07:12.310
phone,

1095
01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:15.970
where the notifications are turned on so that an emails come in for the company.

1096
01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:20.320
You have to instantly answer them.
Even when you're not at work,
you're working,

1097
01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:22.060
you,
you,
there's jobs,

1098
01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:25.810
especially when it comes to silicon valley and these really very competitive

1099
01:07:25.811 --> 01:07:27.040
tech industries,

1100
01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:31.990
there's a lot of like debate as to when you should not have to answer an email.

1101
01:07:31.991 --> 01:07:32.920
Like,
when is it okay?

1102
01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:35.890
Like if your boss sends you an email at seven o'clock at night and you don't

1103
01:07:35.891 --> 01:07:38.380
respond till six o'clock in the morning when you wake up or whatever it is,

1104
01:07:38.650 --> 01:07:41.770
you could get in trouble and they're fucking drug testing you.

1105
01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:46.540
That drives me nuts.
You know,
you smoke weed fucking last weekend.
Yeah.

1106
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:50.350
And you come to work and you,
you're like,
are you fucking kidding me?

1107
01:07:50.351 --> 01:07:52.930
This is slavery.
That one's nuts.
That is slavery.

1108
01:07:52.931 --> 01:07:56.980
We're moving back to Spain and you know,
are you oh yeah.
Really?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1109
01:07:56.981 --> 01:07:59.230
I mean,
this was always a,
a temporary visit.

1110
01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:04.590
This was a slow nomadic trip through North American Portland and then Spain.

1111
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:09.820
Well,
it was,
I mean,
first it was Vancouver,
Canada,
and uh,

1112
01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.680
then we were in Nicaragua for the winter,

1113
01:08:11.681 --> 01:08:14.980
then we went back to Vancouver and then we came to la for the winter is when,

1114
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.100
you know,
you and I had Dunkin

1115
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.610
<v 4>started doing the shrimp parade and all that.
I was living in Topanga,</v>

1116
01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.500
but it's always like a slow move.

1117
01:08:21.501 --> 01:08:24.290
And then we went to Portland for a year and a half.

1118
01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.070
And now we're going to go back to Barcelona.

1119
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:32.060
What made you decide to go back?
Yeah,
well we were always planning to go back.

1120
01:08:32.061 --> 01:08:36.470
I mean,
we,
we sort of flirted with maybe staying for a while.

1121
01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:37.281
Um,

1122
01:08:37.281 --> 01:08:41.390
but my wife's a doctor and for her to get a license in the u s would mean like

1123
01:08:41.391 --> 01:08:45.620
going back to medical school essentially,
which she's not going to do.
Right.
Um,

1124
01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:50.300
and she really likes working.

1125
01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:54.500
She hasn't worked in four years while we've been traveling.
So,
you know,

1126
01:08:54.501 --> 01:08:59.050
that's an issue.
Like if she's going to continue practicing.
Um,
but also just,

1127
01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:02.990
we really liked Spain.
You know,
I've lived in Spain most of my life.
Um,

1128
01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.840
I've lived in Barcelona longer than I've lived anywhere else.

1129
01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.650
And what is it about Barcelona that's more appealing in America?
You know,

1130
01:09:09.651 --> 01:09:13.470
when I first got to Spain,
I felt,
I,

1131
01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:17.420
I traveled a lot and I was actually on my way somewhere else,

1132
01:09:17.421 --> 01:09:19.040
but I got robbed and you know,

1133
01:09:19.041 --> 01:09:24.041
I ended up hanging out and the way Spanish people see life,

1134
01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:27.440
uh,
is much closer to the way I see life.

1135
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:30.740
And so even though I was raised in America,

1136
01:09:30.741 --> 01:09:35.090
I never felt like this country never really made sense to me.

1137
01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:39.200
How so?
Well,
like what we're just talking about like work,
materialism,

1138
01:09:39.201 --> 01:09:43.790
materialism,
you know,
it's all about the money.
Spanish people that,
you know,

1139
01:09:43.791 --> 01:09:47.810
the expression is we work to live.
We don't live to work.
Right.
Um,
you know,

1140
01:09:47.811 --> 01:09:51.770
there no,
like Spanish cars.
There's no cup holder.
If you want,

1141
01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:54.380
you want to get a drink,
pull over in a cafe and get a drink.

1142
01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:59.690
They're know to go cups.
You want a coffee,
go to a cafe.
They really,
yeah,

1143
01:09:59.710 --> 01:10:03.740
there's,
it's like someone should tell them about cups and lids on them.

1144
01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:08.520
The fuck is wrong with those tapes.
Crazy on the civilized.

1145
01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:13.340
He then fucking cave people,
um,
sack hops.
You know,
even though Spain is,

1146
01:10:13.341 --> 01:10:15.320
you know,
officially a Catholic country,

1147
01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:19.280
there's so much more chilled out about sex,
about,
uh,

1148
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:23.750
sex outside of marriage,
like,
eh,
whatever.
Just don't tell me about it.

1149
01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:28.760
That's the sort of normal way to deal with it.
Um,
women,
no,

1150
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:32.300
you look,
I've lived in Spain 23 years or something,
right?

1151
01:10:32.301 --> 01:10:34.670
I get accustomed when I see a beautiful woman.

1152
01:10:34.671 --> 01:10:38.810
I look at her and she knows I'm looking at her and she appreciates it and she

1153
01:10:38.811 --> 01:10:40.790
smiles and I smile and everybody's happy.

1154
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:44.250
Come to America and look at a woman like that.
You're fucking rapist,
right?

1155
01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:48.890
You know,
I raping me.
If you heard that my question questions,

1156
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:51.040
I mean,
fuck your micro aggressions.

1157
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:54.080
I don't want to hear if you're not a fucking dwarf.

1158
01:10:54.081 --> 01:10:58.310
I don't want to hear about microaggressions.
Gimme a break.
I mean,

1159
01:10:58.311 --> 01:11:01.900
this country is just nuts,
man.
And like it,

1160
01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:05.180
and I feel bad because they're there.
I love people here.

1161
01:11:05.181 --> 01:11:07.970
I've got great friends here.
There are a lot of things I love about it.
Like,

1162
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:12.770
you know,
work wise,
it's the best place to be.
But um,

1163
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:16.380
lifewise fuck,
I love Spain.
You go out to lunch with a friend,

1164
01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:21.270
it's probably going to go till five or six o'clock did everybody just hangs out

1165
01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.530
the house?
Yeah,
no,
like restaurants,
right?

1166
01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:28.380
I'm sitting in a restaurant and a,
we're talking the waiter,
first of all,

1167
01:11:28.381 --> 01:11:31.680
the waiter's going to come four times and ask,
you know,
how is everything?
Oh,

1168
01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:34.800
are you,
oh,
how's your day going?
Fuck you get away.
I've tried.

1169
01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:39.360
I tried to talk to my friend here right then.
Then they'll come and say,

1170
01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:43.320
are you still working on that?
This isn't work.
This is fucking lunch.

1171
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:48.180
But my work and on that get out of here,
drive me crazy tips,

1172
01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:53.160
20% I go to Portland,
I fucking,
you know,
buy a croissant and a cup of coffee.

1173
01:11:53.161 --> 01:11:57.440
There's a big tip jar I run my credit card did 10% 15% what?

1174
01:11:57.450 --> 01:12:02.310
You just handed me a fucking bag in a cup.
I'm supposed to give you 15% extra.

1175
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:06.060
That's because your boss is to fucking cheap to pay you a decent wage.

1176
01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.630
<v 3>That is true.
That is exactly what it is.
Yeah.</v>

1177
01:12:08.690 --> 01:12:11.060
I like the tip thing because I like being generous.

1178
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:15.440
I like the option to make someone happy by giving them a nice tip.
Right.

1179
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:19.640
But it is kind of fucked it like waiters and waitresses don't even make minimum

1180
01:12:19.641 --> 01:12:23.320
wage.
Right.
That's,
I don't know if that's true anymore.
They're still true.
Yes.

1181
01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:27.800
True.
That's crazy to me that that seems rude.
It seems evil.

1182
01:12:27.801 --> 01:12:29.060
It seems illegal.

1183
01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:33.610
<v 4>It's humiliating now too because they have to like smile and give you all this</v>

1184
01:12:33.611 --> 01:12:36.870
fake cheerfulness.
There was an article that was written recently about that

1185
01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.210
<v 3>that about the emotional toll of,
uh,</v>

1186
01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.720
requiring people to be artificially happy and that it's not productive and that

1187
01:12:46.401 --> 01:12:51.190
like the artificially happy people that answer phones and ask questions and,

1188
01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:55.990
and how are you today,
sir?
And how's everything like requiring people to do that,

1189
01:12:55.991 --> 01:12:58.630
that work for you?
Not only is it not productive,
it,
it,

1190
01:12:58.710 --> 01:13:02.540
it wears them out and it makes them less productive at other things that you

1191
01:13:02.541 --> 01:13:06.020
probably need them to because there's like,
um,
there's a,
a mental,

1192
01:13:06.021 --> 01:13:08.870
there's an energy that you need to do that,

1193
01:13:08.871 --> 01:13:12.320
that you could be doing and directing towards something that's actually

1194
01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:16.430
productive instead of like fake.
Alien is one thing.
You don't want to be rude,

1195
01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:18.710
but just being efficient is enough.

1196
01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:22.670
You don't have to have this like fake sort of smiley bullshit,

1197
01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:26.330
but that fake smiley bullshit people require it.

1198
01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:30.050
Like especially people who are customers.
The customer's always right,

1199
01:13:30.051 --> 01:13:31.730
like that kind of nonsense.

1200
01:13:31.731 --> 01:13:36.731
Like this relationship where the customer has to be like massage and catered to

1201
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:39.470
instead of just appreciate as a fellow human being.

1202
01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:43.880
There's like an established relationship between the customer and the employee.

1203
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:47.870
Your employee is rude,
sir.
I'm sorry.

1204
01:13:47.871 --> 01:13:50.930
Is there any way we can make it up to you?
I don't know.

1205
01:13:50.931 --> 01:13:55.670
I might be taking my business elsewhere,
whereas,
you know what I mean?

1206
01:13:55.671 --> 01:13:58.820
If that was about friendship,
you'd be like,
well go fuck off.

1207
01:13:58.821 --> 01:14:00.020
Make a new friend dickhead.

1208
01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.550
<v 4>And in Spain,
that's the reaction.
You'll get it as well.
That's nice.</v>

1209
01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:07.480
You go into a shop,
but see the in Spain,
I bitch all the time too.
Right.
So yeah,

1210
01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:10.990
I'll take it with a grain of salt.
But um,
I'm from Spain.

1211
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:16.000
Well then where's the fucking waiter?
The people are rude.
It's exactly,

1212
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.500
that is true.
That one,
the opposite.
This service is not as good.

1213
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.850
It's just not,
no,
because they don't get paid tips and they don't give a fuck.

1214
01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.730
What should probably give a fuck.
Like this should be,
oh,

1215
01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:32.230
there's a middle ground there somewhere.
Yeah.
I think that is the middle ground.

1216
01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:32.501
Right.

1217
01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:37.501
I think like in Spain you go into a shop to buy whatever and the woman's on the

1218
01:14:38.531 --> 01:14:39.550
phone with her boyfriend.

1219
01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:44.520
She's going to finish your conversation before she comes to help you.
Right?
Yeah.

1220
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:45.550
But I mean,
for example,

1221
01:14:45.551 --> 01:14:49.480
I went to Spain a few months ago to renew my residency paperwork and all that.

1222
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:54.310
And it was a typically Spanish experience where,
you know,

1223
01:14:54.311 --> 01:14:56.820
this kind of thing in America,
you would,
you know,

1224
01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.800
go online and fill out this thing and you know,

1225
01:14:59.801 --> 01:15:04.150
call the IRS and be on hold and then you get some grumpy ass hole in

1226
01:15:04.151 --> 01:15:07.960
Philadelphia and,
but it would all get done pretty quickly in Spain.

1227
01:15:07.961 --> 01:15:10.060
You go to this office and they're like,
hey,
how are,

1228
01:15:10.061 --> 01:15:13.120
Ya know they're really friendly and nice and all.
No,
it's not this office.

1229
01:15:13.121 --> 01:15:16.140
You have to go to this other office.
Oh sorry.
Okay.
You go to the other office,

1230
01:15:16.141 --> 01:15:18.280
they're really nice,
but that's not the right office either.

1231
01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:19.360
They misinformed you and,

1232
01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:22.570
but nobody's got any like Mile Lha as they say in Spanish,

1233
01:15:22.571 --> 01:15:25.930
which is like bad milk,
literally,
which like bad intentions.

1234
01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:31.150
So it takes three days and it's kind of a pain in the ass,

1235
01:15:31.450 --> 01:15:34.480
but it isn't a painting ass because you're having fun all the time.

1236
01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.080
Everyone's nice.
The women are beautiful,

1237
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:41.650
the cops are nice in Spain,
they're nice guys.

1238
01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:46.150
You can go up to a cop in Spain and be like,
hey man,
you know,
can I park here?

1239
01:15:46.151 --> 01:15:47.080
And he's like,
Eh,

1240
01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:50.890
I remember literally trying to park my motorcycle in the Ramblas and,

1241
01:15:50.891 --> 01:15:54.340
and it's no parking,
but there are motorcycles everywhere.

1242
01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:56.950
And there's this cop standing right there.
So I go over and I'm like,

1243
01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:02.290
I'm a foreigner.
Right?
Can I park my bike here or not?
And he says,
legally,
no,

1244
01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:03.490
but nobody will say anything.

1245
01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:08.930
But can you imagine an American cops and that maybe the 60s when,

1246
01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.350
when would that have ever been said in this catch?

1247
01:16:11.351 --> 01:16:13.680
You'd have to be a long time ago.
And see the,

1248
01:16:13.681 --> 01:16:17.680
the legal system is in Spain.

1249
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:20.620
It's a problem if you're bothering someone,

1250
01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.170
not if you're breaking a law.

1251
01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:27.580
If you're breaking a law and nobody says anything,

1252
01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:32.080
the cops don't give a shit.
So in America,
it's the law.

1253
01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:36.460
It's did you break the law?
Are you growing weed on your terrorists?

1254
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:40.840
We're flying helicopters with infrared detectors to catch you.

1255
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:45.280
Not,
did your neighbors complain or did you shoot somebody?

1256
01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:49.030
Right in Spain,
like,
I grew weed on my terrorist for 20 years.

1257
01:16:49.031 --> 01:16:53.750
Nobody said a fucking word.
Nobody cared less weed,
legal in Spain.
Uh,

1258
01:16:53.751 --> 01:16:58.300
like a lot of things in Spain,
it's Kinda not kinda is.

1259
01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:01.840
And,
and this is a really important,
uh,

1260
01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:06.820
cognitive difference between Spain and the u s is tolerance for ambiguity.

1261
01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:11.540
Like,
like in Spain,
I'll tune in like,
oh,
there's a,
you know,

1262
01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:16.490
Barson Madrid soccer game,
really big deal,
right?
Starts at eight o'clock,

1263
01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.300
I'll turn on the TV at eight o'clock and there's still some fucking sitcom on

1264
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:23.000
what's going on.
Well,
they running late,
you know,

1265
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:27.980
the game will start in 10 minutes or,
you know,
it's just,
can you park here?

1266
01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:30.140
Well,
Eh,
you know,

1267
01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:35.141
there's a lot of ambiguity and no one really cares if it's not causing a

1268
01:17:35.871 --> 01:17:40.820
problem,
whatever,
to get to Ah,
whatever.
You know.
So we'd,
for a long time,

1269
01:17:40.821 --> 01:17:43.100
weed was illegal officially,

1270
01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.000
but the cops didn't care.
Um,

1271
01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:52.010
so like if you're smoking a joint on a playground and a cop walks by,

1272
01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:55.520
he's probably gonna say,
dude,
what the fuck?
Go,
go somewhere else.

1273
01:17:55.521 --> 01:17:59.180
Get away from this playground,
that kids here.
That's what would happen.
That's it.

1274
01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:04.010
That's it.
If you give him shit,
then maybe it'll escalate.

1275
01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.580
But they have quotas.
No,
none of that.

1276
01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:09.530
No quote is no property seizures.

1277
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:14.030
There's none of that stuff that's no minimum mandatory sentencing.

1278
01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:15.330
The property seizures.
Yeah.

1279
01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:20.240
<v 3>People know about it.
They're mean.
I,
they've lessened considerably.</v>

1280
01:18:20.241 --> 01:18:24.910
But those things are horrific.
And what they've done to people is they've,

1281
01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.980
they've dragged people into the legal system oftentimes when they're completely

1282
01:18:27.981 --> 01:18:32.390
innocent.
Yeah.
Property seizures and not necessarily in many states.

1283
01:18:32.391 --> 01:18:34.790
Even a result of them catching you with something illegal.

1284
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:37.100
It's catching them with too much cash.

1285
01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:40.250
Like there's a lot of people that have gotten caught.
Some states,

1286
01:18:40.251 --> 01:18:43.190
I think it was North Carolina or South Carolina,
some states,

1287
01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:47.090
h w w were really bad with it.
They would catch people that would be say like,

1288
01:18:47.091 --> 01:18:48.530
say if you were going to buy a car,

1289
01:18:48.531 --> 01:18:51.080
like you call the guy on the phone how much you want for the car?
10 grand.
Okay,

1290
01:18:51.081 --> 01:18:52.790
I got it.
So you've got your 10 grand,

1291
01:18:52.791 --> 01:18:56.240
your cash and driving over this guy's house to buy the car and you have this 10

1292
01:18:56.241 --> 01:18:58.940
grand,
you get pulled over the cop go,
what are you doing?
10 Grand?

1293
01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:00.230
I'm going to buy a car.
Well,

1294
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:02.540
we don't believe you were going to take that 10 grand.

1295
01:19:02.690 --> 01:19:05.150
And so they would take that 10 grant.
In one case,

1296
01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:10.100
this police department had bought a Margarita machine with a 10 grand that they

1297
01:19:10.101 --> 01:19:13.070
stole from people that they thought were buying drugs.

1298
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:17.690
So they claim to think we're to think,
but just stop and think about that.

1299
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:21.110
They took the Margarita machine by a drug machine,

1300
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:24.830
which is what a Margarita machine is.
I mean a Margarita mixer.

1301
01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:28.190
Like what the fuck man?
Like that kind of corruption,

1302
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:33.020
that kind of sneakiness where you write it down and you make it legal quotes.

1303
01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:37.460
Well it's on the books search,
you know,
acid asset forfeiture be a,

1304
01:19:37.461 --> 01:19:40.880
for people that are suspicious or suspected for selling drugs.

1305
01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:44.480
If you have more than x amount of dollars on you,
we can pull you over for that.

1306
01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.210
And they've just used that over and over again,

1307
01:19:47.211 --> 01:19:52.100
that one law to rip off law abiding citizens and then drag them through the

1308
01:19:52.101 --> 01:19:54.650
legal system for years at their own expense.

1309
01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:58.100
So even if they get their money back,
the amount of time it's cost them.

1310
01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.060
And you know,

1311
01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:02.600
obviously that time a lot of it is you're going to lose work because of that

1312
01:20:02.601 --> 01:20:05.690
time and then hiring lawyers,
legal fees

1313
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:08.160
<v 4>and if you lose,
they just,</v>

1314
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.260
<v 2>they robbed you of time and the money.</v>

1315
01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:12.450
If you can't prove where that money came from,

1316
01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:15.810
like maybe you're just really shitty with your taxes,
you don't pay taxes,

1317
01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:19.380
you work for cash and you've been just like working odd jobs for cash is she

1318
01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:21.240
saved up a bunch of money.
You can't,

1319
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:25.650
you can't prove that that money came from illegal means you're fucked.
Well,

1320
01:20:25.651 --> 01:20:27.090
like everything else in this country,

1321
01:20:27.091 --> 01:20:31.530
it's set up to fuck the person who can't afford to defend them and set up even a

1322
01:20:31.531 --> 01:20:32.251
creepier way.

1323
01:20:32.251 --> 01:20:35.130
That's anti the way this country's supposed to be set up where you're guilty

1324
01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:38.050
until proven innocent.
You have to prove yourself innocent,
right?

1325
01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:40.890
Just by having currency on you,
I mean,

1326
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.440
and it's less than someone makes in a year.

1327
01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:46.950
It's like the idea that you had savings,
get the fuck outta here.

1328
01:20:46.951 --> 01:20:51.720
You don't save anything dummy and see that and some kid who's selling weed and

1329
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:55.710
live in his parent's basement.
If they bust him,
they take the parents' house.

1330
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:58.590
Parents had nothing to do with it.
They'll take your car,

1331
01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:02.640
they pull you over and you got a joint in your car.
They sell your car.
I mean,

1332
01:21:02.641 --> 01:21:05.880
there's been a lot of that going on over the past few decades.

1333
01:21:06.090 --> 01:21:07.950
Ever since that just say no shit.

1334
01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:12.630
When we saw on television with Nancy Reagan that that began the fucking hysteria

1335
01:21:12.631 --> 01:21:13.261
of this stuff.

1336
01:21:13.261 --> 01:21:18.240
And then asset forfeitures just legalized stealing and it's a,
you know,

1337
01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:21.210
a fucking billion dollar industry in this country.
Yeah.

1338
01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:25.020
Legalized stealing and then you've got legalized.
Um,
you know,

1339
01:21:25.021 --> 01:21:27.510
a bribery in the political system.

1340
01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:32.280
That's what lobbyists are.
Those trucks.
Yeah,
super pacs.
I mean,

1341
01:21:32.281 --> 01:21:36.190
the whole of the whole,
I mean,
this country is collapsing right eye.

1342
01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:39.090
You can see it.
If you start reading these books we're talking about,

1343
01:21:39.091 --> 01:21:41.250
you can see the phase that we're in.

1344
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:45.960
We're in a phase now where there are all these different industries that are set

1345
01:21:45.961 --> 01:21:48.690
up to extract the Commonwealth.

1346
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:53.640
Like literally the wealth of the community is being pulled in a war.

1347
01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:56.280
The wars in the Middle East.
What was that serving?

1348
01:21:56.281 --> 01:21:59.700
The only people who benefited from any of that were,
you know,

1349
01:21:59.701 --> 01:22:03.030
Bechtel and Raytheon and Halliburton.
Yeah.

1350
01:22:03.090 --> 01:22:07.470
These guys who do this for a living and Eisenhower himself said,

1351
01:22:07.471 --> 01:22:09.060
you know the military industrial complex,

1352
01:22:09.061 --> 01:22:14.061
when you get people who make a living with bombs and they need to be making

1353
01:22:15.181 --> 01:22:17.370
bombs,
well they're going to blow those bombs up.

1354
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:19.740
They got to find a reason to use those box cars.

1355
01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:23.910
That was one of the creepiest speeches ever and the most fascinating thing about

1356
01:22:23.911 --> 01:22:28.110
it is that it was captured.
I mean it was,
it was broadcast on television,

1357
01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:31.800
but if you didn't listen to at that time it was gone.

1358
01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:36.270
He said it and then it was gone and it was years and years and years later

1359
01:22:36.271 --> 01:22:39.600
before people started actually watching that,
like in the fog of war.

1360
01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:42.460
It wasn't in the fog of war was in that is that the,

1361
01:22:42.461 --> 01:22:46.560
the McNamara movies might not have been in that but,

1362
01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:50.040
but regardless,
it's definitely available on Youtube.

1363
01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:53.760
I mean I've watched it a dozen in the corporation.
Have you seen that film?

1364
01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:56.700
That's a great doctor.
Very good documentary.

1365
01:22:56.701 --> 01:23:00.490
That's a creepy documentary when you realize that when they compare
corporations,

1366
01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:03.450
psychopaths,
and the idea of the infinite growth paradigm,

1367
01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:06.010
it is constantly making new.
Like if you make

1368
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:10.780
<v 3>$1 billion a year,
you go,
wow,
you're successful.
What do you make next year?
Well,</v>

1369
01:23:10.781 --> 01:23:13.270
I'm just going to make a billion again.
What are you a fucking loser?

1370
01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:18.190
You have to make 1,000,000,001 billion to infinite growth.

1371
01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:21.400
Like that is what the stock market's all about,
right?
Yeah.
Consistent,

1372
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:25.630
infinite growth.
Apple consistently makes more money every year.

1373
01:23:25.631 --> 01:23:27.460
They have to make more money at Google every year.

1374
01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:30.880
Every fucking company they have to make more money.
You can't,

1375
01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.740
Chris Ryan enterprises is,

1376
01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:36.090
you have to constantly be in the Black Chris Ryan,

1377
01:23:36.170 --> 01:23:40.560
<v 0>bad news for my shareholders.
We peaked.</v>

1378
01:23:40.610 --> 01:23:44.150
We decided to convert our dollars to whatever the fuck they have in Spain.

1379
01:23:44.151 --> 01:23:48.020
What's the Spain money?
Oh,
they're in euro's now.
Used to be pacet those.

1380
01:23:48.410 --> 01:23:51.680
So what do you do when you go over there?
I still back.

1381
01:23:51.681 --> 01:23:55.610
I left my fucking wife work.
I married a doctor.
Dude,

1382
01:23:55.611 --> 01:24:00.470
I thought I married a doctor.
I'm like,
I am sad.
I am set for life.

1383
01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:02.310
And that's how you were thinking when you married her.

1384
01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:06.370
Well you know a little bit while you love her obviously of course I love there's

1385
01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:09.670
also that added benefit.
The fact that she's in a good business.
Well I,

1386
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:13.370
I mean the thing is doctors in Europe don't make the kind of money doctors

1387
01:24:13.371 --> 01:24:16.940
making the u s right,
but nor do they,
you know,
go out,

1388
01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:21.500
come out of college with 200 grand in debt.
Right.
So practice insurance,

1389
01:24:21.501 --> 01:24:23.720
is that all it's burden?
No,

1390
01:24:23.721 --> 01:24:28.580
I mean the whole thing is so amped up in the u s good doctor.
Like you know,

1391
01:24:28.581 --> 01:24:33.080
normal sort of,
she's a psychiatrist.
The psychiatrist in Spain,

1392
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:36.830
you know,
good experience,
whatever might make 70 grand a year,

1393
01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:41.350
something like that.
You know,
like a decent stable,
you know,
good benefits.

1394
01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:46.010
Everyone in Spain,
everyone in Europe gets at least a month off every year.

1395
01:24:46.670 --> 01:24:50.880
That's cool.
Paid a month.
If you work in a shop,
you get a month off you,
whatever.

1396
01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:53.900
But they have the full 30 days off.
Or do they get like a week here,

1397
01:24:53.901 --> 01:24:56.420
a whole 30 days.
Use it when you want three days in a row.

1398
01:24:56.470 --> 01:25:00.010
Most you can do if you want.
Most people take August the month of August.

1399
01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:04.880
Like nothing is happening in Barcelona is empty really in the month of August.

1400
01:25:04.881 --> 01:25:08.980
Yeah,
it's,
it's amazing.
Um,
but you know,
like the,

1401
01:25:08.981 --> 01:25:13.981
the thing about Spain that I love is that life is about pleasure.

1402
01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:16.730
I mean,
if we had to really boil it down,

1403
01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:21.590
there is no shame in pleasure and in America.
Pleasure is shameful.

1404
01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:25.790
Why do you think that is?
Is why we say it goes back to the puritans,

1405
01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:31.340
the original sort of influence with the puritans and that it got amped up.

1406
01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:33.051
You know,

1407
01:25:33.051 --> 01:25:36.080
like we're talking about the war on drugs and we were talking about the Cobra

1408
01:25:36.081 --> 01:25:39.080
factory and these unintended consequences.
If you look,

1409
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:44.110
it's serve political ends to keep attacking outsiders who did have pleasure,

1410
01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:50.280
black Indians,
uh,
Mexicans,
you know,

1411
01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:53.430
they're coming back again into fashion is the victims,
you know,

1412
01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.810
attack these brown skinned a pleasure,
pleasure.

1413
01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:02.660
You know,
he didn't just cause they're,
they're evil.
They're,

1414
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:04.040
that's all evil shit with their

1415
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.780
<v 4>dance.
Nobody buys that shit in Europe.
Footloose fain anyway.</v>

1416
01:26:07.890 --> 01:26:12.010
<v 2>Yeah.
Fucking flipped Lewis.</v>

1417
01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:16.140
This is how dumb we are in America.
We made footloose again,

1418
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:21.180
they tried to remake footloose box.
That's interesting though.

1419
01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.730
It's also when you look at it,

1420
01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:28.560
America is so overwhelmingly infatuated with productivity.

1421
01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:33.450
Yeah.
You know,
I mean being productive and getting agency.
Yes.
Sufficiency.

1422
01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:36.760
Yeah.
And you know,
look at our workforce,
you know,

1423
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:40.650
will like there's a God damn commercial.
I think it's for like Shell.

1424
01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:42.090
I think it's,

1425
01:26:42.090 --> 01:26:46.290
I think it's a shell commercial and there's a an old band and it's a weirdest

1426
01:26:46.291 --> 01:26:48.120
fucking commercial and it's,

1427
01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:53.010
it's talking about how hard this guy works and this guy,

1428
01:26:53.011 --> 01:26:56.370
he's a farmer and he's like standing like a field of wheat and he's like,

1429
01:26:56.371 --> 01:27:00.330
you work hard.
Not because you have to,
but because it's what you do.

1430
01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:04.080
And the guy smiles and I'm like,
what the fuck are you saying?

1431
01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:07.650
It's almost like you're trying to trick people into working hard so they can

1432
01:27:07.651 --> 01:27:11.730
tell people there it is.
Right the most.
This is the guy.
Can we play this?

1433
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.110
This is play this cause it's just go full screen because it's so fucking
bizarre.

1434
01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:20.110
This is one of the weirdest commercials,
man.
I always weird out.
Can I,

1435
01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:23.670
cause they ere this commercial during hunting shows?

1436
01:27:24.370 --> 01:27:28.620
<v 5>No,
because you have to
know because some boss</v>

1437
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.850
that,
because that's what you were born to do.

1438
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:38.510
<v 2>Now watch this.
They get close on.
This guy serves the best we can do a smiles.</v>

1439
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:40.940
It's what you're born to do.
Thank you.

1440
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:45.830
Thank you for working hard from the number one heavy duty engine oil and
America.

1441
01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:46.820
What the fuck?

1442
01:27:46.821 --> 01:27:51.230
Kind of a commercial is that it's what you were born to do.

1443
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:52.670
<v 4>Now here's what kills me.</v>

1444
01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:57.560
The person who wrote those words doesn't work for Shell.

1445
01:27:57.770 --> 01:28:01.670
He works for an advertising agency that they hired to do that.
Yeah,
that old man.

1446
01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:04.080
He's a fucking actor.
Yes.
Uh,

1447
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:08.860
nobody who works for Shell really had anything to do with that.
You know?
So the,

1448
01:28:08.861 --> 01:28:13.460
the classic commercial,
we here at Chevron,
we believe that when I read Blah,

1449
01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:17.240
and then you see all the people with clipboards and hardhats and various racial

1450
01:28:17.241 --> 01:28:20.420
backgrounds.
None of those people work for fucking Chevron.

1451
01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:24.520
He wrote the words doesn't work.
The guy who was reading the words,

1452
01:28:24.521 --> 01:28:26.180
it doesn't worry.
There is no,

1453
01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:29.610
Chevron is like a is an entity that's,

1454
01:28:29.690 --> 01:28:31.390
there is no there,

1455
01:28:31.391 --> 01:28:36.391
there is a collection of people designed to collect money and it's not even the

1456
01:28:37.121 --> 01:28:39.100
people who matter because the,

1457
01:28:39.101 --> 01:28:43.150
all of those people could quit tomorrow and Chevron would still exist.

1458
01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:44.410
They just hire more people.

1459
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:47.890
So Chevron's like the whirlpool and the people are the water.

1460
01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:51.820
Oh you know that's so that's part of this whole thing I'm writing.

1461
01:28:51.850 --> 01:28:56.380
But did you see that commercial?
Speaking of irritating American commercials,

1462
01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:57.251
there was one,

1463
01:28:57.251 --> 01:29:01.030
I think it was on the Superbowl even where there's like a dude walking through

1464
01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:01.973
house

1465
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:05.610
<v 2>and he's like,
why do I have the best I have the best cause that's what I am.</v>

1466
01:29:05.611 --> 01:29:08.190
And that's what I do.
And he like high fives.
His kid,

1467
01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.310
it was a Cadillac commercial under that.

1468
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:16.080
He'd seen it.
Oh it was so fucking annoying.

1469
01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:20.490
Why do I have the best cause that's what I said too.
I am,
we work harder.

1470
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:24.600
We play harder.
W and it's about America row.

1471
01:29:27.810 --> 01:29:30.600
What happened to bro,
bro used to be cool.

1472
01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:33.420
You know that goes in a frat.
I know,

1473
01:29:33.450 --> 01:29:37.740
but calling someone bro used to be what's up bro.
He used to be okay.

1474
01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:40.320
He used to be like a black thing.
In fact,

1475
01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:42.600
it started out with white people ruined it.

1476
01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:47.250
It's like white guys ruined bro.
What's up bro?

1477
01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:51.930
Like that used to be okay [inaudible] be like,
he called me Bro.
I'm a brother.

1478
01:29:51.931 --> 01:29:56.370
It's short for brother.
But now bro is like a douchey his thing,

1479
01:29:56.371 --> 01:29:57.181
someone could call you,

1480
01:29:57.181 --> 01:30:00.940
he's up in a row or one of the things that people love to throw around is,

1481
01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:04.380
especially in the fitness industry is bro Science.

1482
01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:07.830
It's like when like there's a lot of like really wacky ideas when it comes to

1483
01:30:07.831 --> 01:30:09.450
athletics and uh,
some,

1484
01:30:09.610 --> 01:30:13.890
some people they have these ideas that don't necessarily have any scientific

1485
01:30:13.891 --> 01:30:16.920
background to them and they call it bro Science.
Yeah,
yeah.

1486
01:30:16.921 --> 01:30:21.840
He's full of Bro Science bromance.
Yeah Bro.
Man.
But bromance is,
you know,

1487
01:30:21.841 --> 01:30:24.720
you love a guy.
Like that's like,
oh,
that guy's awesome.

1488
01:30:24.721 --> 01:30:26.310
I got a bromance with that guy.
And there's like,

1489
01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:30.150
not as quite as there's like this,
someone was teaching me the,
what is it?

1490
01:30:30.151 --> 01:30:33.240
The hand shake shoulder one arm.

1491
01:30:33.670 --> 01:30:38.070
There is a definite thing.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
There's like a grip,

1492
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:42.410
like a fucking manly thumb up grip and then the,

1493
01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:47.080
the one thing,
and if you're really,
do she give a couple slaps on the back?
The,

1494
01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:50.680
yeah.
There's a word for that too,
that like,
I'm not gay slapped.

1495
01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:53.670
I've seen people slap each other pretty goddamn hard doing that.

1496
01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:57.180
That doesn't feel good.
Here's another thing I love about Spain.

1497
01:30:57.750 --> 01:31:00.780
You kiss girls always on the mouth when you know,

1498
01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:04.940
when on the cheeks when you meet,
uh,

1499
01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:12.870
you meet a woman,
you kiss,
kiss a,
okay.
Then I come to America and it's like,

1500
01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:17.340
hi,
how are you?
You know,
like keep four feet away from him.
He might be a rapist.

1501
01:31:17.341 --> 01:31:20.700
Your I raping them already.
What are you doing looking at them?

1502
01:31:20.701 --> 01:31:25.530
You fucking create you over 50,
50 looking at a woman.
Shit,

1503
01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:27.390
fuck is wrong with you.

1504
01:31:27.391 --> 01:31:30.840
Don't you have grandchildren or something that's going wait on.
Hey,

1505
01:31:30.841 --> 01:31:32.760
what do you think about about Donald Trump?

1506
01:31:32.761 --> 01:31:35.790
Talking about how hot his daughter is?
Did he say that he did?
Oh,

1507
01:31:35.791 --> 01:31:40.200
you didn't hear about this became a big problem because he said,
uh,

1508
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:45.150
he said,
you know,
Ivanka,
my daughter,
she's one of the hottest,

1509
01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:47.640
most beautiful women alive.
And he said,

1510
01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:52.400
I'll tell you what if I were 30 years younger and not her dad,
Whoa,

1511
01:31:52.410 --> 01:31:56.070
what the fuck does that mean?
Jesus Christ?

1512
01:31:56.430 --> 01:32:00.090
I wonder if he's jerked off to his daughter just saying,
look,
this is just

1513
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:04.110
<v 0>thought no one's getting hurt here.
Me alone in my idea,</v>

1514
01:32:06.670 --> 01:32:09.690
I made her.
Yeah.
I don't know.

1515
01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:12.790
It's a weird thing to say is a weird thing to say,

1516
01:32:12.791 --> 01:32:17.791
but I think it's better to say it than to think it and give it power.

1517
01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:22.720
Right,
right.
I think saying shit,
and this again,
you know,

1518
01:32:22.721 --> 01:32:25.420
back to the whole Spain us thing,
uh,

1519
01:32:25.570 --> 01:32:30.570
in America there is a thought crime and in Spanish,

1520
01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:35.140
I don't think,
you know,
maybe I'm romanticizing span.
I lived there a long time.

1521
01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:38.530
But another thing I really like about living in Spain is that I,

1522
01:32:38.710 --> 01:32:43.270
I speak the language well enough to like,
if I'm paying attention,

1523
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:46.510
I know what everyone's saying,
but if I'm not paying attention,

1524
01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:50.830
it all just becomes Ruben.
I'm born,
I'm blue in the background.
Oh,
nice.
Like jazz.

1525
01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:55.320
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's sort of let her be kind of elevator music.
Yeah.

1526
01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:58.360
Yeah.
When I was in high school,
there was a,

1527
01:32:58.390 --> 01:33:03.130
someone wrote a paper for the,
the,
an article for the local school paper.

1528
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:08.470
And um,
you know,
I don't remember most things from high school so long ago,

1529
01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:13.390
but I remember this one article that this kid wrote about what they make you do

1530
01:33:13.391 --> 01:33:18.010
in the boy scouts,
and it was about the tenants of the boy scouts,

1531
01:33:18.011 --> 01:33:22.780
whatever they were.
But one of them was about keeping your thoughts pure.
Oh yeah.

1532
01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:25.330
And he wrote something that was really cool.
It wasn't,
you know,

1533
01:33:25.331 --> 01:33:29.470
obviously really smart kid.
I wish I remember who it was,
but he wrote,
well,

1534
01:33:29.471 --> 01:33:32.260
why do I have to keep my thoughts pure?
He goes,

1535
01:33:32.261 --> 01:33:35.430
one of the things that I like about my thoughts so that they're mine there.

1536
01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:39.280
I can think whatever I want,
as long as I don't do anything that harms anybody.

1537
01:33:39.490 --> 01:33:43.150
Why do you care what my thoughts are?
And I remember reading that and I was like,

1538
01:33:43.151 --> 01:33:46.570
wow,
that's so right.
Like what?
What does that mean?
Keep your thoughts?

1539
01:33:46.571 --> 01:33:50.830
Pure guy's in jail now,
probably.
Yeah,
he might be.
He might be just a,

1540
01:33:50.831 --> 01:33:52.990
George Carlin did a great thing on that,
you know,

1541
01:33:52.991 --> 01:33:56.050
in terms of Catholicism and how he said like,

1542
01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:00.220
this was like class clown way back,
right?
Yeah.
I remember I was a little kid.

1543
01:34:00.221 --> 01:34:04.810
My Dad got that record and I remember the one of the bits in there was like,

1544
01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:08.800
you know,
in Catholicism,
if you think about sitting,

1545
01:34:09.250 --> 01:34:13.570
you've already sent.
So you're thinking about feeling up Sally at the weekend,

1546
01:34:13.630 --> 01:34:18.430
save your time.
You're,
you're already your sin.
It's done right.
And pure thoughts,

1547
01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:23.470
impure thoughts that straight out of Christianity.
Well,
the also the confession,

1548
01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:27.010
it confessionals one of the most bizarre and ridiculous,

1549
01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:30.030
but his balls on the table,
any religious it.

1550
01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:33.730
And it was invented to make sure that people weren't doing anything wrong.

1551
01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:35.000
I mean,
the,

1552
01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:40.100
the priests would immediately report to any higher ups have any illegal activity

1553
01:34:40.211 --> 01:34:42.070
or stealing or you know,

1554
01:34:42.210 --> 01:34:44.830
adultery or fornication or whatever the fuck it would be.

1555
01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:49.270
[inaudible] about the crazy shit where people were fucking animals in the middle

1556
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:53.800
ages and they would have trials and sometimes the animals would be executed for

1557
01:34:53.801 --> 01:34:58.610
being overly seductive.
You know what?

1558
01:34:58.611 --> 01:35:03.020
Now that you brought this up,
I read something recently about this,
God,

1559
01:35:03.021 --> 01:35:06.690
I can't remember what the story was,
but it was the animal trials.
It was about,

1560
01:35:06.730 --> 01:35:10.810
and we'll try,
they might've been like batteries could be,
I dunno.

1561
01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:14.960
I have a friend who just wrote a book,
the boundaries of desire.
Uh,

1562
01:35:14.961 --> 01:35:19.580
he's a historian who focuses on,
um,
sexuality.

1563
01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:20.690
And,
uh,

1564
01:35:20.690 --> 01:35:25.690
his first book was sex and punishment and it was sort of like from the origins

1565
01:35:26.421 --> 01:35:30.560
of civilization to the end of the 19th century.
And then boundaries of desires,

1566
01:35:30.561 --> 01:35:31.490
the 20th century.

1567
01:35:31.730 --> 01:35:35.660
So he writes about all this crazy legal shit and you know,

1568
01:35:35.661 --> 01:35:39.200
like the Comstock laws that made it illegal to,
to,
um,

1569
01:35:39.650 --> 01:35:42.080
in early 20th century America to,
uh,

1570
01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:44.810
to even teach sex education to women.

1571
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:47.780
Like you couldn't even teach women how they get pregnant.

1572
01:35:47.781 --> 01:35:51.070
That was a legal cause of this crazy fun.
Wow.

1573
01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:55.940
I've always wondered what it is about people that makes them like,

1574
01:35:55.941 --> 01:36:00.740
it's oftentimes like some of the earliest imprinting with pleasure that makes

1575
01:36:00.741 --> 01:36:03.950
people attracted to certain things.
This is where like fetish has come from.

1576
01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:07.370
And I've always wondered like,
like some people are like,

1577
01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:11.000
just overly attracted to extremely overweight women.

1578
01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:15.110
Like for whatever reason that just locks in to them.
That's their thing.

1579
01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:16.580
And I've always wondered like,

1580
01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:21.710
what is it about sexuality that like sexuality is like malleable.

1581
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.880
Like you can kind of,

1582
01:36:22.881 --> 01:36:27.881
it kind of adjusts to like what your earliest impressions of like I've heard

1583
01:36:28.581 --> 01:36:30.230
stories of guys who,
uh,

1584
01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:35.000
caught their mom putting on pantyhose wants when they were like really young and

1585
01:36:35.001 --> 01:36:39.920
then for the rest of their life became like fascinated with a fetish of women

1586
01:36:39.921 --> 01:36:43.430
wearing panty hose and like don't want to jerk off on pantyhose and have

1587
01:36:43.450 --> 01:36:48.110
pantyhose rubbed on their dicks and it becomes this weird sort of a sexual

1588
01:36:48.111 --> 01:36:50.480
imprinting thing.
Right?
Yeah.

1589
01:36:50.481 --> 01:36:55.130
One of the interesting differences between male and female sexual development is

1590
01:36:55.131 --> 01:36:58.490
that women don't seem to have that women appear,

1591
01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:01.040
it's called erotic plasticity.

1592
01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:03.980
Women are plastic throughout their lives,

1593
01:37:03.981 --> 01:37:07.670
so it's easier for them to adapt to different situations.

1594
01:37:07.671 --> 01:37:10.160
Now sometimes that works against them,
right?

1595
01:37:10.161 --> 01:37:14.120
Because they fall in love with an asshole and abusive asshole or whatever.

1596
01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:15.313
But um,

1597
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:20.410
men have a developmental window generally from like five to nine years of age,

1598
01:37:21.501 --> 01:37:24.650
somewhere in there.
And it's exactly as you described it,

1599
01:37:24.651 --> 01:37:28.940
if there's a particular experience that they have during that time,

1600
01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:32.210
it can resonate with them for the rest of their lives.

1601
01:37:32.211 --> 01:37:37.070
And once that window closes,
that's it.
It's done.
So,
you know,
as you say,

1602
01:37:37.071 --> 01:37:40.820
it could be pantyhose,
it could be red,
high heels,
it could be,
you know,

1603
01:37:40.821 --> 01:37:41.690
whatever it is.

1604
01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:46.130
They've got that association and they can never not have it.

1605
01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.960
They'll have it for the rest of their lives.

1606
01:37:48.230 --> 01:37:53.150
Some people argue that pedophilia is a result of this same sort of thing.

1607
01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:56.130
And I've argued not in writing,
but I've,

1608
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:57.900
<v 4>I've mentioned it on the podcast.</v>

1609
01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:01.530
I think that there's a form,

1610
01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:06.270
a manifestation of homosexuality of what we call homosexuality,

1611
01:38:06.271 --> 01:38:10.470
which is really a fetish,
um,

1612
01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:15.270
is more,
is better described as a fetish experienced by a straight man.

1613
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:19.920
And all right,
I'll tell you what I mean by that.
Let's say you,

1614
01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:22.290
you're born straight.
There's,

1615
01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.770
there's definitely a genetic component to sexual orientation,
right?

1616
01:38:25.771 --> 01:38:28.890
It's getting back to where we started.
Like how much is genetic,

1617
01:38:28.891 --> 01:38:30.810
how much is experiment experiential?

1618
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:36.590
So just as a seven year old boy can have an experience with,

1619
01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:41.130
you know,
seeing someone with pantyhose or,
you know,
whatever.

1620
01:38:41.131 --> 01:38:44.640
He's under the table and his mom's friend comes and she's got red high heeled

1621
01:38:44.641 --> 01:38:47.340
shoes and he's got a hard on.
And so he associates the two.

1622
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:53.820
What if that seven year old boy has an experience with another boy or within a

1623
01:38:53.821 --> 01:38:56.880
man or an adolescent or whatever.
Right?
So he,

1624
01:38:56.881 --> 01:38:59.700
this guy sucks his dick or whatever it is.

1625
01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:04.620
And so he's got this very deep association between have,
you know,

1626
01:39:04.621 --> 01:39:08.040
having a man sucking his dick and this incredible pleasure,

1627
01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:13.320
even though he's straight,
he's got that association.
So for the rest of his life,

1628
01:39:13.321 --> 01:39:17.790
he could have that association in the same way that another boy has the

1629
01:39:17.791 --> 01:39:22.110
association with pantyhose or high heeled shoes or whatever.
It's a fetish.

1630
01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:24.000
It's not his orientation.

1631
01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:29.420
So then what you've got is a straight guy who has a fetish for getting a blow

1632
01:39:30.271 --> 01:39:31.290
job from a man.

1633
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:34.620
So every once in a while he goes down to the truck stop and you know,

1634
01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:39.480
has this experience,
he gets caught.
Everyone says,
oh,
you're a closeted gay man.

1635
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:43.080
And He's thinking,
I don't think I am,

1636
01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:47.670
but I don't know what the fuck I am.
All I know is I love my wife.

1637
01:39:47.670 --> 01:39:51.480
I have sex with my wife.
I idea I'm not,

1638
01:39:51.481 --> 01:39:53.220
I could never fall in love with a man.

1639
01:39:53.221 --> 01:39:55.980
I never think about having a relationship with a man.
But man,

1640
01:39:55.981 --> 01:40:00.150
I love it when this guy with a mustache sucks my dick.
So I,

1641
01:40:00.151 --> 01:40:02.760
I've never really wanted to write about this.

1642
01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:07.820
And the reason is that I think it could play into the hands of the Christians

1643
01:40:08.581 --> 01:40:13.140
who are arguing that you can pray the gay away.
Yeah.
You see what I mean?

1644
01:40:13.650 --> 01:40:17.760
Because in a case like that,
I think there could be a therapeutic,

1645
01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:22.480
um,
uh,
solutions,
well solution or,

1646
01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:26.910
or just a re a therapeutic treatment that could have some value.

1647
01:40:27.590 --> 01:40:31.260
Um,
but I mean,
in my case,
I would never say that there's a sickness there.

1648
01:40:31.261 --> 01:40:34.650
I would just say it's a fetish.
Like some people are into latex.
You're into that,

1649
01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.880
you know,
totally makes sense.
I mean,
it's,

1650
01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:43.280
there are weird things that people get sort of bonded to their sexuality gets

1651
01:40:44.701 --> 01:40:48.210
bonded to always men,
almost never women.

1652
01:40:48.570 --> 01:40:53.350
You'll never find a woman who can't come,
you know,
if she's not sniffing latex.

1653
01:40:56.180 --> 01:41:00.490
<v 0>But something about rubber.
I have a friend who's a dominatrix or not.</v>

1654
01:41:00.491 --> 01:41:04.660
She's more than it.
I mean,
she's a humiliate tricks.
Humiliate,
humiliate tricks.

1655
01:41:04.661 --> 01:41:05.830
So she's the next level.

1656
01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:09.490
She specializes in dudes who get off on being humiliated.

1657
01:41:09.491 --> 01:41:13.870
And I had her on the podcast.
Uh,
she's,
she's really smart,
really interesting.

1658
01:41:13.871 --> 01:41:16.900
And it's not her thing.
She just stumbled into this.

1659
01:41:16.930 --> 01:41:20.080
So it's just a business for her.
It's a business.
She's like Shell oil,

1660
01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:25.330
Dick Slapping.
We hear it humiliate tricks.
We Suck Dick.

1661
01:41:25.331 --> 01:41:29.950
Not because we want to.
Oh,
because what we're,
which she never meets the dude's.

1662
01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.620
It's all internet.
One on,

1663
01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:37.640
one of the best things about it is she's got phone lines dedicated to guys who

1664
01:41:38.561 --> 01:41:40.180
get off on being ignored.

1665
01:41:42.710 --> 01:41:47.260
So the phone rings,
she picks it up.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
I'll be right back.

1666
01:41:47.261 --> 01:41:50.230
Puts the phone down and goes about her day.
And it's like,

1667
01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:52.753
yeah,

1668
01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:58.080
guys who get off on being ignored by the Greek to be ignored by a professional.

1669
01:41:59.981 --> 01:42:03.910
Ignore.
She sells her socks,
her panties,

1670
01:42:03.911 --> 01:42:08.380
her old tennis shoes,
her toenail clippings,
her hair,

1671
01:42:08.590 --> 01:42:09.700
her salon.
She,

1672
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:14.910
the way she got into it was she's living in Japan and she was like 17 or

1673
01:42:15.431 --> 01:42:20.431
something and she was a corresponding with some guy online and like he was

1674
01:42:21.011 --> 01:42:23.680
trying to pick her up and she wasn't into it,
but he was funny.

1675
01:42:23.681 --> 01:42:27.120
So she corresponded with them.
And at one point he said,
she said,

1676
01:42:27.130 --> 01:42:30.430
I gotta go take a Piss.
And he said,
Oh,
don't throw it away.
Put it in a bottle.

1677
01:42:30.431 --> 01:42:34.630
I'll buy it from you.
She's like,
come on,
do you're full of shit.
And he's like,
no,

1678
01:42:34.631 --> 01:42:38.080
seriously,
trust me,
I will.
I'll styles,
you know,
200 bucks or whatever.

1679
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:39.071
So she puts it,

1680
01:42:39.071 --> 01:42:43.270
she pisses in a bottle and she sends it and there's 200 bucks shows up in her

1681
01:42:43.271 --> 01:42:46.840
account.
She's like,
wow,
this is interesting.

1682
01:42:48.010 --> 01:42:51.930
There must be more guys like this out there.
So she starts,
you know,

1683
01:42:51.970 --> 01:42:55.690
investigating it and she finds that the world is full of these dudes.

1684
01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:00.550
Seriously check her out.
Sierra Lynch.
It's like,
all right,

1685
01:43:00.551 --> 01:43:04.180
I'm going to write her name,
check out her site.
She's beautiful.
Does she live?

1686
01:43:04.450 --> 01:43:06.010
She lives in Portland and see it,

1687
01:43:06.011 --> 01:43:10.420
but she spells it c e a r a Sierra Lynch.

1688
01:43:11.010 --> 01:43:15.550
Um,
and yeah,
she's got guys,
but she's been on a,

1689
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.500
she was on a show on a,
yeah,

1690
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:24.270
HBO recently show that as some sex show.
I was on it too.
Um,

1691
01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:28.330
she's been profiled.
She's,
you know,
she's a public figure.
That's hilarious.

1692
01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:30.970
Dunkin used to know a girl who would do,

1693
01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:35.080
she is Dunkin used to know a girl humiliate tricks.

1694
01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:37.480
Xtrordinair congratulations young lady.

1695
01:43:38.170 --> 01:43:42.280
You found an excellent niche or niche as it were.
Um,

1696
01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:45.670
Duncan knew a girl who would sell her socks and a,

1697
01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:49.420
she would wear them for days at a time to get them like really stinking and then

1698
01:43:49.421 --> 01:43:53.240
she would sell them to dudes and you know,
like a couple hundred bucks at a time.

1699
01:43:53.241 --> 01:43:54.200
So like that was her thing.

1700
01:43:54.201 --> 01:43:57.020
She's just be wearing socks all the time and then sending them to people.

1701
01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:01.670
It's a good gig.
Gas Getting paid for doing what you're doing anyway,

1702
01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.760
I guess.
I don't know.

1703
01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:08.120
There's just something weird about the idea of being connected to these people

1704
01:44:08.121 --> 01:44:13.070
that are so fucked up.
They want your stinky socks.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1705
01:44:13.071 --> 01:44:17.420
Although as you know,
as things go,
I mean,
getting back to fetishize,
you know,

1706
01:44:17.421 --> 01:44:20.780
it's a relatively harmless,
harmless thing,
you know,

1707
01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:25.781
and the fact that now people can engage these things in a more or less open way.

1708
01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:31.670
I mean,
what worries me with her is she,
she was telling me like,

1709
01:44:31.671 --> 01:44:34.280
there are guys who really get off on being blackmailed.

1710
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:43.270
So these guys would give her like all their bank account numbers,

1711
01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:45.020
passwords,

1712
01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:50.150
and then they would send her photos of like,
you know,

1713
01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:52.670
like me with a dildo up my ass.

1714
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.140
And now her job is to threaten to tell the wife,

1715
01:44:57.620 --> 01:45:00.050
uh,
you know,
I'm going to tell your wife if you don't like,

1716
01:45:00.051 --> 01:45:01.940
give me $500 and oh no,

1717
01:45:01.941 --> 01:45:04.730
please don't tell my wife and you got to go through this whole thing.

1718
01:45:07.230 --> 01:45:11.740
And I mean,
it's kind of crazy,
you know?
And I said to her like,
you know,
well,

1719
01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:13.640
and she said like,
I'd never,
you know,

1720
01:45:13.670 --> 01:45:17.090
I don't contact wives because they haven't agreed to participate in this.

1721
01:45:17.091 --> 01:45:19.780
I'm not going to do that.
Well that's very ethical of her.
Oh,
she's,

1722
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:23.280
she has to be at professional.
She's a pro.
Uh,

1723
01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:26.660
but I said to her,
well,
like,
what about the banking on?
She's like,
no,

1724
01:45:26.661 --> 01:45:29.750
I would never,
you know,
I don't,
I don't,
that would be a crime.

1725
01:45:29.751 --> 01:45:31.220
Even if the guy gave it to me.
And I said,
yeah,

1726
01:45:31.221 --> 01:45:35.480
but what if your email gets hacked?
And she was like,
oh,
I hadn't thought of that.

1727
01:45:36.230 --> 01:45:40.910
Yeah.
Some Russian kid that email.
That's a lot of stuff there.

1728
01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:43.100
Wow.
That's an interesting thing.
Well,

1729
01:45:43.101 --> 01:45:48.020
maybe the guy's a separate humiliation bank account.
I hope so.

1730
01:45:48.230 --> 01:45:51.620
I,
yeah,
I mean,
God,
I mean,
but to get to real rush,

1731
01:45:51.621 --> 01:45:55.700
you'd have to give her your real bank account to get the real full.
Like,
fuck,

1732
01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:57.230
I could be ruining my life.

1733
01:45:57.410 --> 01:46:00.830
I know another woman who specializes in kicking dudes in the balls.

1734
01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:03.950
I've seen that.
I've seen girls step on them.

1735
01:46:04.530 --> 01:46:08.930
It was like step on guys balls like the high heel shoes,
stomp on them.

1736
01:46:09.770 --> 01:46:14.030
You could lose a ball like that by the way.
Super easy.
Yeah,
I would think so.

1737
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:17.480
Oh God.
It's so terrifying.
I'm so boring.
I mean,

1738
01:46:17.481 --> 01:46:20.960
I spent time with all these like really kinky people,
but like

1739
01:46:22.890 --> 01:46:27.490
basic,
you know,
well you're not fucked up.
Sorry.

1740
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.371
But it's,

1741
01:46:30.371 --> 01:46:33.350
it goes back to what we're saying about people being sexually malleable.

1742
01:46:33.351 --> 01:46:34.700
Like what do you think that is?

1743
01:46:34.701 --> 01:46:39.110
Is it because people couldn't have like a very rigid or men rather couldn't have

1744
01:46:39.111 --> 01:46:42.020
a rigid idea of what sexually attractive because it's,
they did,

1745
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:44.870
if their standards are too high,
then they wouldn't reproduce.

1746
01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:49.350
And so in the times of demanding,
you know what,
we're like

1747
01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:54.630
<v 3>John Marco grow,
uh,
who is one of the,
um,
uh,</v>

1748
01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:57.240
lead scholars that was discipling the Dead Sea Scrolls.

1749
01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:01.660
He wrote this book called the Sacred Mushroom and the cross.
And it was,
yeah,

1750
01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:06.180
it's,
it's great book and a,
it was bought up by the Catholic Church actually.

1751
01:47:06.181 --> 01:47:10.020
And the [inaudible] only find it in a [inaudible] for a while.

1752
01:47:10.021 --> 01:47:13.200
You could only find it in,
um,
used form,

1753
01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:17.790
but now a young urban is a republished it and you can,
you can get it again.
Uh,

1754
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:21.150
and he wrote another one called the Christian,

1755
01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:26.100
your sacred mushroom and the Christian sacred mushroom in the cross and

1756
01:47:26.370 --> 01:47:29.340
something Dead Sea Scrolls in the Christian myth.

1757
01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:33.570
And it's essentially about,
uh,
that what the,

1758
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:36.960
it's his after studying the Dead Sea Scrolls for 14 years.

1759
01:47:36.961 --> 01:47:39.840
It's his interpretation that what the,

1760
01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:44.250
what Christianity was really all about was the consumption of psychedelic

1761
01:47:44.251 --> 01:47:45.900
mushrooms and fertility cults.

1762
01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:50.070
And that fertility back then was extremely important.

1763
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:54.270
It's extremely important to breed because we didn't have this luxury that we

1764
01:47:54.271 --> 01:47:57.660
have today of like people say,
oh,
he's your girl on the pill,
man,

1765
01:47:57.661 --> 01:47:59.220
I got her pregnant.
Fuck,
what do I do?

1766
01:47:59.221 --> 01:48:02.940
Like people wanting to get people pregnant because the human population was not

1767
01:48:02.970 --> 01:48:03.810
guaranteed.

1768
01:48:03.811 --> 01:48:07.200
Like there was a very real possibility that you would come into a village that

1769
01:48:07.201 --> 01:48:08.880
was empty because everybody died.

1770
01:48:09.210 --> 01:48:12.870
They died of play or they were invaded or whatever the fuck it was.

1771
01:48:12.871 --> 01:48:15.780
Like they didn't have enough people.
And now there's no one.

1772
01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:20.100
And your name doesn't pass on so that this was like a real possibility.

1773
01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:25.280
So people is the idea of being sexually mallow malleable that people can adapt

1774
01:48:26.281 --> 01:48:29.550
to almost anything to become attracted,

1775
01:48:29.551 --> 01:48:32.520
to just make sure that they are attracted to something,

1776
01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:34.920
that they can come in something and make a person,

1777
01:48:34.921 --> 01:48:37.680
whether it's overweight women or skinny women or this or that,

1778
01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:42.300
that it can move around and that occasionally it gets imprinted.

1779
01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:46.710
That this is like the thing that you're really into and that in times of great

1780
01:48:46.711 --> 01:48:51.040
excess when people are Slovenly and like,
like today,
like,
you know,

1781
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:54.650
you like this idea that [inaudible] guy gets a fetish off being blackmailed.

1782
01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:56.820
Like what is that?
That's a guy with too much fucking free time.

1783
01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:01.320
Clearly much money,
too much money,
too much free time.
He's not starving to death.

1784
01:49:01.321 --> 01:49:03.600
That's not a guy who was out there picking mushrooms trying to find something

1785
01:49:03.601 --> 01:49:05.710
edible to eat.
You know,
this is a guide.

1786
01:49:05.711 --> 01:49:10.500
It's like sitting around trying to figure out way to occupy his fucked up mind

1787
01:49:10.770 --> 01:49:12.140
because you know,

1788
01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:16.180
it's too easy to just live like he doesn't have real survival concern.

1789
01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:20.350
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah.
Well we've eroticized power,
which,</v>

1790
01:49:20.351 --> 01:49:23.650
which ties into that.
Um,
uh,

1791
01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:27.270
I've read that,
uh,
one,

1792
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:33.750
one source of clientele for a lot of these sorts of women is Muslim dudes who

1793
01:49:34.961 --> 01:49:39.670
want to be forced to eat pork.
They get an erotic charge from that.

1794
01:49:41.050 --> 01:49:45.520
Makes Sense.
It makes sense.
Right?
Yeah,
makes sense.
I mean,
I often think like,

1795
01:49:45.550 --> 01:49:49.420
you know,
getting back to like my boring sexuality,

1796
01:49:49.810 --> 01:49:54.810
I think part of the reason that I'm not kinky is that I'm not repressed.

1797
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:58.750
Right.
You know,
and in a way it's like,
it's like a steam engine.

1798
01:49:58.751 --> 01:50:02.470
If you don't have that container and build up the pressure,

1799
01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:07.360
you don't get that explosive release.
So if you're just kind of like,
yeah,

1800
01:50:07.361 --> 01:50:11.950
whatever,
you know,
I get laid sometimes and I like women and yeah,

1801
01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:14.890
like it's great,
but it's,
I mean,

1802
01:50:14.891 --> 01:50:19.891
I wonder if healthy is less exciting than crazy.

1803
01:50:21.190 --> 01:50:25.210
<v 3>Well,
he's crazy exciting to you though because crazy is not exciting to me.</v>

1804
01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:29.920
I don't fight like the humiliate humiliate tricks.
I absolutely believe her.

1805
01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:33.780
I believe that she has like a series of guys that wanted to shit in their face,

1806
01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:38.580
<v 0>whatever the hell it is.
But to me it's silly.
I don't get it.</v>

1807
01:50:38.970 --> 01:50:39.750
Like,
you know,

1808
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:44.370
what are those guys having stronger orgasms than you and me.

1809
01:50:45.090 --> 01:50:46.380
It could be by me

1810
01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:48.950
<v 3>costs.
Yeah,
that's it.
Get it.</v>

1811
01:50:48.951 --> 01:50:52.840
They steal your bank account is shut in your face and you just of like a fucking

1812
01:50:59.110 --> 01:51:03.570
maybe.
What do mean is that that fucking brief experience of coming,

1813
01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:04.710
you know?

1814
01:51:04.710 --> 01:51:08.910
I mean how much it would all you have to do if you want to come really hard,

1815
01:51:08.911 --> 01:51:12.990
it's just not come for awhile.
Right?
You don't really need to have,

1816
01:51:12.991 --> 01:51:15.300
so it kick you in the balls or shit in your hair,

1817
01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:18.390
like things you can do.

1818
01:51:18.690 --> 01:51:21.630
All you have to do is just like go without water.

1819
01:51:21.631 --> 01:51:25.350
Tastes amazing when you haven't had any water for awhile.
And it's true though,

1820
01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:29.010
when you haven't had water for a while,
God,
it's the greatest thing in the world.

1821
01:51:29.011 --> 01:51:31.620
But when you have it all the time,
it becomes normal and you don't even want it.

1822
01:51:31.621 --> 01:51:35.640
You want a diet coke.
Yeah.
But if you were starving or dying of thirst,

1823
01:51:35.641 --> 01:51:39.510
rather you,
you would just love to get that water in your mouth.

1824
01:51:39.690 --> 01:51:41.700
And I think that's kind of the same thing with sex.

1825
01:51:42.090 --> 01:51:45.660
And that's where I think a lot of perverts fucked themselves over cause they're

1826
01:51:45.661 --> 01:51:48.720
just jacking off all day till they get blisters on their Dick and then they have

1827
01:51:48.721 --> 01:51:52.650
to find a new way to hold their Dick where it doesn't hurt as much.
And you,

1828
01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:55.530
when you do come,
it's,
you're chasing the dragon.

1829
01:51:55.531 --> 01:51:59.220
Like it doesn't feel good anymore.
But if you could just take a few weeks off,

1830
01:51:59.670 --> 01:52:03.450
you would be so horny that when you did come it,
your ears would rang.

1831
01:52:03.451 --> 01:52:08.060
You'd be like,
Whoa,
but you can't,
you can't hold off.

1832
01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:12.670
<v 0>And if he,
if you hold off long enough,
then you get to the promised land.</v>

1833
01:52:12.671 --> 01:52:17.350
Which wet dreams.
Oh yeah,
I can get those after three days.

1834
01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:20.350
Seriously,
three days of no sex man.

1835
01:52:20.351 --> 01:52:24.310
Your testosterone levels must be through the roof in their day.
Yeah,

1836
01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:27.190
I've make sure that through the roof I add it.

1837
01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:30.190
Oh I should probably try that now that I help.
I'm a creep.

1838
01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:35.780
Once you reach creep age,
what you need is t well people do,
you know that's a,

1839
01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:39.730
it's like a source of shame for some people.
They don't want to admit that

1840
01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:42.910
<v 3>stastrom replacement therapies,
like a shameful thing.</v>

1841
01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:45.620
Like people have asked me and then I told them,
I go,
yeah,
yeah,

1842
01:52:45.621 --> 01:52:48.270
I take testosterone and they go like,
what?
I'm like,

1843
01:52:48.271 --> 01:52:50.930
could you just tell peaches admitting yet like,
look,
it's,

1844
01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:53.000
it's a chemical component of your body.

1845
01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:57.740
It's like if your body was lacking in blood and you can just simply add blood to

1846
01:52:57.741 --> 01:53:01.430
it,
you feel better wouldn't,
wouldn't you do that?
Yeah.
But for whatever reason,

1847
01:53:01.431 --> 01:53:05.900
testosterone is associated with being a man.
I also have a Hypo thyroidism.

1848
01:53:06.230 --> 01:53:09.770
It's a,
it's called Hashimoto's disease.
It's a genetic,

1849
01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:12.620
my mom has it and other people in my family habit,

1850
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:16.240
so I take the stuff called Armour thyroid.
That is a,

1851
01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:20.600
it's formulated from pigs thyroid and it's great.
It makes me feel way better.

1852
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:22.820
But I was having some real problems before I was taking,

1853
01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:26.000
I get these crazy headaches at night,
like my head was pounding or I thought,

1854
01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:29.030
I thought it was something really wrong with me and I would fall asleep.

1855
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:32.090
Like when I would fall asleep,
it was like I got shot with a tranquilizer dart.

1856
01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:35.420
Like at the end of the day I was just so wiped out.

1857
01:53:35.421 --> 01:53:40.090
I couldn't figure out what it was.
And uh,
so,
uh,
while I was on fear factor,
um,

1858
01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:44.330
I had some real issue with it.
Like I'm fucking,
headaches would be crazy.

1859
01:53:44.331 --> 01:53:48.620
I was be so tired at the end of the day and then I got my blood test done.

1860
01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:53.240
But I tell people that I take thyroid medication and nobody would bat an eye

1861
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:56.120
like,
Oh,
you replaced your thyroid hormone.
Well that's logical,

1862
01:53:56.350 --> 01:53:59.090
but you tell people that you replace your testosterone and they're like,
well,

1863
01:53:59.091 --> 01:54:02.270
what the fuck are you doing that do you have to know?
I definitely don't have to.

1864
01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:03.980
If I take it off,
if I stopped doing it,

1865
01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:07.340
I will have less testosterone than I have now,
but I won't feel as good.

1866
01:54:07.490 --> 01:54:11.450
Is that simple?
It's up to you to not abuse it though,

1867
01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:13.670
because if you abuse it,
like there are guys,

1868
01:54:13.671 --> 01:54:17.600
like especially at some MMA fighters if like tested like these hyper human

1869
01:54:17.601 --> 01:54:21.260
levels that are not even safe.
Like they're really actually kind of dangerous,

1870
01:54:21.330 --> 01:54:21.530
right?

1871
01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:25.040
Because the idea is that more is better and just keep going harder and harder.

1872
01:54:25.041 --> 01:54:28.370
But you really shouldn't do that because then you could develop anxiety.

1873
01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:31.160
There's a lot of different things that happened when you do it like rage and

1874
01:54:31.161 --> 01:54:33.940
stuff,
you can definitely get rage.
You,
um,

1875
01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:38.030
you definitely get more upset at things more easily.
But a lot of people,

1876
01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:40.280
they develop actual anxiety.
Like you,

1877
01:54:40.290 --> 01:54:45.020
you have a anxiety attacks from having,
uh,
an excess of testosterone.

1878
01:54:45.310 --> 01:54:48.200
Start getting paranoid and you can get weirded out about things.

1879
01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:52.610
It's just a matter of going to an ethical doctor that really understands what

1880
01:54:52.611 --> 01:54:56.540
they're doing and then make sure you're,
you're not taking too much of it.

1881
01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:59.990
You're doing it right.
And you just want to stay within like a healthy,

1882
01:54:59.991 --> 01:55:02.150
consistent standard and you'll just feel better.

1883
01:55:02.151 --> 01:55:03.650
Your immune system will function better,

1884
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:05.680
but people don't like to talk about it because it,

1885
01:55:05.681 --> 01:55:10.130
it it like you have to admit that somehow or another you needed that.

1886
01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:14.510
You have to admit that you're aging.
You don't have to write shameful again.

1887
01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:18.800
It's amazing.
They also,
and you're taking it not to like,
you know,

1888
01:55:18.801 --> 01:55:23.150
combat a disease.
You're taking it to feel better,
which is pleasure,

1889
01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:26.180
which is shameful,
shameful pleasure during pleasure.

1890
01:55:26.181 --> 01:55:29.960
You want to feel good all the time.
Well,
that's my issue with marijuana too.

1891
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:32.420
You know,
I tell people like people that,
why do you need pot?

1892
01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:37.010
It's not that I need it.
I enjoy it,
I enjoy it and it gives me more pleasure.

1893
01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:38.810
It gives me more pleasure when I watch movies,

1894
01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:41.780
it gives me more pleasure when I eat food and it gives me way more pleasure when

1895
01:55:41.781 --> 01:55:45.270
I have sex.
It's sex feels way better when you take marijuana,

1896
01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:48.720
but that's an embarrassing thing to admit for some people,
whatever,

1897
01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:53.520
for whatever reason,
I love how the word needs comes in.
Why do you need it,
bro?

1898
01:55:53.521 --> 01:55:58.500
I don't need weed to have fun.
Who the fuck said anyone needed anything here?

1899
01:55:58.550 --> 01:56:01.950
You know,
I don't even need toothpaste.
Moralistic,
don't use toothpaste.

1900
01:56:01.951 --> 01:56:04.500
My teeth will be less clean,
but you know,
I don't need it.

1901
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:09.960
It's a weird,
we were weird,
man.
We're weird.

1902
01:56:09.961 --> 01:56:14.130
And also that we don't want it.
We don't want to factor in our own mortality.

1903
01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:16.530
We don't want to address it.
We don't not want to admit it.

1904
01:56:16.770 --> 01:56:19.890
So anything that you're doing to mitigate that is a weakness.

1905
01:56:20.250 --> 01:56:24.930
Anything you're doing to combat anti aging is just vanity,
you know,
like,

1906
01:56:24.931 --> 01:56:29.490
well I guarantee you I have more energy because of it.
Again,
I know I do.

1907
01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:31.260
I know I feel better.
I can get done,

1908
01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:34.560
I can get more things done and my body works more efficiently,

1909
01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:38.610
especially someone like me that enjoys doing things that are physically active,

1910
01:56:38.611 --> 01:56:42.330
like martial arts,
Jujitsu,
like without the testosterone,

1911
01:56:42.331 --> 01:56:46.020
without growth hormone and thyroid hormone and all these different hormones that

1912
01:56:46.021 --> 01:56:49.290
are functioning at their optimum levels.
Your body's just not gonna work as well.

1913
01:56:49.291 --> 01:56:52.250
It's like having a race car that you don't take care of the spark plugs.

1914
01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:54.480
You don't,
you don't,
you know,
you don't replace the oil.

1915
01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:58.800
He just let it drive it until that fucking engine seizes up and then you're
done.

1916
01:56:58.830 --> 01:57:01.590
That's nature.
That's nature.
But if we need that,

1917
01:57:01.591 --> 01:57:04.740
but that's not nature because why are we getting vaccinated then you know,

1918
01:57:04.741 --> 01:57:06.270
why are we taking vitamins then?

1919
01:57:06.271 --> 01:57:09.120
Why am I going to the doctor and getting checkups?
Why don't I just like cancer?

1920
01:57:09.150 --> 01:57:13.170
Eat My body?
Why get chemo?
Why?
You know,
it's just natural.

1921
01:57:13.410 --> 01:57:18.330
Like we have weird ideas of what you should and all those weird ideas or not

1922
01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:21.090
based on critical thinking and objective analysis.

1923
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:23.460
They're just based on the standards at somehow or another.

1924
01:57:23.461 --> 01:57:26.040
Someone else has set forth Chevron.

1925
01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:32.570
So you were born to work hard because you were born to you.

1926
01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:35.040
I mean,
you get a same thing with like these sex pills.

1927
01:57:35.041 --> 01:57:39.730
Like now the female Viagra and stuff.
It's bad.
It's bad shit.

1928
01:57:39.810 --> 01:57:44.500
Yeah.
Well it doesn't work either because of what we're saying.
No,
because the,

1929
01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:48.420
because of where we were talking about earlier,
the plasticity that women,

1930
01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:53.160
women's sexuality isn't about blood flow,
right?
Men,

1931
01:57:53.161 --> 01:57:57.200
if you make your Dick hard,
you're horny because in,

1932
01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:01.560
in engages nerve endings and you know,
like my Dick's hard,

1933
01:58:01.570 --> 01:58:04.890
I gotta fuck something,
you know.
Well,
even when guys get like a pea boner,

1934
01:58:05.070 --> 01:58:08.280
like when guys like get,
like if women don't know this,

1935
01:58:08.730 --> 01:58:12.680
when men have to urinate and your wake up in the middle of the morning and your,

1936
01:58:12.681 --> 01:58:13.441
your Dick is hard,

1937
01:58:13.441 --> 01:58:16.290
it's not because you're horny a lot of the times it's because you have to pay

1938
01:58:16.291 --> 01:58:18.750
this morning wood.
Yeah.
And that's what morning wood is.

1939
01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:22.530
But you can use that morning wood like you could use like any,

1940
01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:24.150
any regular old boner.

1941
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:27.780
So when a guy wakes up and he has a boner and he did a lot,
oftentimes it's like,

1942
01:58:27.781 --> 01:58:29.730
well I don't want to waste that.
You know,

1943
01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:35.190
it becomes like a hammer that looks like a nail because like this looks like a

1944
01:58:35.191 --> 01:58:37.840
thing to use right here.
Excellent.
Will you,

1945
01:58:37.841 --> 01:58:41.980
you have a on average three erections per night if you sleep

1946
01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:45.300
<v 4>eight hours.
Really?
So while you're sleeping you're getting boners.
Yeah.</v>

1947
01:58:45.301 --> 01:58:49.240
And that's one of the ways they test to see if you're a impotence is

1948
01:58:49.241 --> 01:58:54.190
psychological or physiological.
They'll put like a little piece of paper tape,

1949
01:58:54.370 --> 01:58:58.660
uh,
on your,
on your Dick and in the morning if the tape is torn,

1950
01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:01.450
it means you had an erection at night.
So it means your body,

1951
01:59:01.451 --> 01:59:05.110
your blood flow is fine.
It's a head thing.
Wow.
Weird.

1952
01:59:05.770 --> 01:59:09.790
You have to tie a ribbon around your Dick Tie Ribbon Round Sarah in the middle

1953
01:59:09.790 --> 01:59:13.960
of the night for the hostages.
How strange.

1954
01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:19.150
What a strange thing.
Sex is weird.
I mean you,
you,
you asked a question earlier,

1955
01:59:19.210 --> 01:59:21.160
uh,
about the,
you know,

1956
01:59:21.161 --> 01:59:25.180
what's the purpose of the fetish generation,
you know,

1957
01:59:25.181 --> 01:59:30.010
module in the male brain and all that.
And I was thinking,
well two things.

1958
01:59:30.050 --> 01:59:31.900
Um,
one in sex at dawn,

1959
01:59:31.901 --> 01:59:36.901
we talked about animals cause this appears to be not only a human thing but

1960
01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:41.590
common to male mammals as well of other species.

1961
01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:46.570
Um,
there was one experiment where this guy,
I think he was in Scotland,

1962
01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:48.340
took all the,

1963
01:59:48.910 --> 01:59:52.900
he had a herd of sheep and a herd of goats,

1964
01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:57.970
and when year he took all the babies and he put them with the other species.

1965
01:59:57.971 --> 02:00:01.300
So now all the baby goats are living with the sheep and all the baby sheep are

1966
02:00:01.301 --> 02:00:02.350
living with the goats.

1967
02:00:02.710 --> 02:00:06.790
And he let them live with that species until they reach sexual maturity.

1968
02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.880
At which point they were having sex with the,

1969
02:00:10.090 --> 02:00:13.090
so the goats are having sex with the sheep and the sheep were having sex with a

1970
02:00:13.091 --> 02:00:17.320
goat story.
Then he takes them and puts them back with their own species.

1971
02:00:18.010 --> 02:00:22.690
Okay.
And what happened was the females were like,
all right,
whatever.

1972
02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:26.800
And they were now,
so now the female sheep are having sex with the male sheep.

1973
02:00:27.250 --> 02:00:31.060
Right.
There were switched back,
but the males refused.

1974
02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:34.900
The males who came,
you know,
who had been raised with the other species are like,

1975
02:00:34.901 --> 02:00:38.410
no,
I'm a goat fucker.
Sorry.
Not Interested.

1976
02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:41.320
Because they had been imprinted.
Wow.

1977
02:00:41.321 --> 02:00:45.460
So the females just went with what was there.
The males were like,
no,
no,

1978
02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:49.870
that's not me.
So that's really interesting.
Yeah,
that's really interesting.

1979
02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:52.160
And the testosterone,
and we also talked about that.

1980
02:00:52.190 --> 02:00:55.750
I remember there were some interviews with um,
a guy,

1981
02:00:55.751 --> 02:01:00.010
there was one that was a guy who had a disease where he's body suddenly stopped

1982
02:01:00.011 --> 02:01:03.790
making testosterone and he described,
you know,

1983
02:01:03.791 --> 02:01:07.120
eventually he was diagnosed and started taking supplements,

1984
02:01:07.121 --> 02:01:11.320
but he described it and he would,
and it was like all,

1985
02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:15.850
it wasn't about sex.
It was all pleasure stopped.
It was like,

1986
02:01:15.970 --> 02:01:19.630
I didn't give a shit about music.
I didn't give a shit about food.

1987
02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:21.910
I didn't give a shit about relationships.

1988
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:24.730
I just was like blahzay about everything.

1989
02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:28.510
And then there was another one where we quoted a,

1990
02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:33.490
someone who's going through a sex change from female to male.

1991
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:36.790
And she talked about like when she was a woman,

1992
02:01:36.791 --> 02:01:40.910
she was a lesbian and she lived in Manhattan and she was talking about like,

1993
02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:45.770
yeah,
you know,
I'd be on the subway and I'd see an attractive woman.
And I think,

1994
02:01:45.771 --> 02:01:49.940
Huh,
I wonder what she's like and what kind of food she's into and what she's

1995
02:01:49.941 --> 02:01:53.660
reading.
And there and then when she was transitioning to Male,

1996
02:01:53.661 --> 02:01:58.190
she started taking testosterone and she said,
once I started taking testosterone,

1997
02:01:58.191 --> 02:02:02.000
I'd be on the subway and I'd see the same kind of woman and I'd just be like,

1998
02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:03.073
tats

1999
02:02:04.010 --> 02:02:08.690
<v 2>can't.
And
she said,</v>

2000
02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:10.300
she said,
uh,
I,

2001
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:14.540
it really gave me insight and compassion for adolescent boys.

2002
02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:18.120
Chaz Bono said that.
Oh really?
Yeah,
she said that when,

2003
02:02:18.190 --> 02:02:22.460
well he said that when he transitioned from being female to Male,

2004
02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:26.030
that he understands it now.
Yeah.
For the longest time,

2005
02:02:26.031 --> 02:02:28.520
like he never understood man and it was just alien to them.

2006
02:02:28.521 --> 02:02:31.860
And then once he started taking testosterone and you're like,
oh yeah,

2007
02:02:31.890 --> 02:02:33.710
this is why guys are so fucking creepy.

2008
02:02:34.090 --> 02:02:37.340
It's like they're just overwhelmed by this demon inside of the we call called

2009
02:02:37.341 --> 02:02:41.240
testosterone that you require in order to be happy and to enjoy anything in
life.

2010
02:02:41.590 --> 02:02:41.781
I was,

2011
02:02:41.781 --> 02:02:46.220
one of the things that happens to men with a traumatic brain injuries is the

2012
02:02:46.221 --> 02:02:49.370
pituitary gland gets damaged,
they stop producing testosterone,

2013
02:02:49.371 --> 02:02:50.630
they get deeply depressed.

2014
02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:54.320
And one of the best ways to mitigate that or supplementing them with

2015
02:02:54.321 --> 02:02:58.790
testosterone like that cure is a lot of the depression that a lot of these

2016
02:02:58.791 --> 02:03:02.300
soldiers go through when they come back from the war is traumatic.

2017
02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:06.740
Traumatic brain injury just disrupts the pituitaries uh,
ability to function.

2018
02:03:07.150 --> 02:03:10.030
<v 4>You know,
one of the,
we,</v>

2019
02:03:10.570 --> 02:03:15.190
when you sort of typical situation and get a guy like my dry mid fifties,

2020
02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:16.960
been married a long time,

2021
02:03:16.961 --> 02:03:21.961
monogamous typical midlife crisis has sex with his secretary and then suddenly

2022
02:03:23.531 --> 02:03:28.270
it's like Holy Shit,
you know,
I'm in love.
Right?
Why does he think he's in love?

2023
02:03:28.271 --> 02:03:32.260
Because food tastes better.
The colors are brighter,

2024
02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:34.720
everything's more interesting.
Why is that?

2025
02:03:34.721 --> 02:03:36.670
Because his testosterone levels have gone up.

2026
02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:40.630
One of the only things you can do without supplements to increase testosterone

2027
02:03:40.631 --> 02:03:42.040
is has sex with a new woman.

2028
02:03:42.730 --> 02:03:46.450
Your body responds to you having sex with a new woman with a spike in

2029
02:03:46.451 --> 02:03:50.800
testosterone production.
So he's got this t elevated t levels.

2030
02:03:50.890 --> 02:03:53.110
He thinks he's in love,
he's not in love.

2031
02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:55.780
He's just fucking someone new for the first time in 20 years.

2032
02:03:56.740 --> 02:03:58.060
So he divorces his wife.

2033
02:03:58.061 --> 02:04:01.060
Cause now he's in love with this woman who seems to have the keys to the fucking

2034
02:04:01.061 --> 02:04:03.120
universe that wears off in a couple of

2035
02:04:03.410 --> 02:04:07.390
<v 2>it and now he's,
you know,
even more fucked than he was before.
Well,</v>

2036
02:04:07.391 --> 02:04:11.260
that's also the key to this whole midlife crisis thing where guys buy sports

2037
02:04:11.261 --> 02:04:15.280
cars,
you know,
reports will also sports cars.

2038
02:04:15.281 --> 02:04:19.180
Like literally driving a sports car elevates your testosterone,

2039
02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:22.060
especially when you're quote unquote peacocking.

2040
02:04:22.210 --> 02:04:25.270
Especially if Jay Leno's driving and you're in the passenger seat,

2041
02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:29.920
that was as good episodes actually.
But when you're driving around people,

2042
02:04:29.950 --> 02:04:34.060
especially potential young mates,
females,
they could see you write,

2043
02:04:34.061 --> 02:04:38.460
your testosterone rises when you're in this car.
Right.
And even

2044
02:04:38.490 --> 02:04:43.140
<v 0>talking and flirting with potential young girls that you may,</v>

2045
02:04:43.170 --> 02:04:47.220
you know,
one day have sex with just being around them raises your testosterone.

2046
02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:51.810
Just the possibility.
Yeah.
Well,
I wonder,

2047
02:04:52.050 --> 02:04:53.310
getting back to Sierra,

2048
02:04:53.311 --> 02:04:56.490
I wonder if some of those guys who were buying her panties,

2049
02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:01.060
if they're not getting to start her own surges,
probably they're getting,
well,

2050
02:05:01.090 --> 02:05:04.860
something's happening,
right.
There's getting some kind of dopamine,
Serotonin,

2051
02:05:04.890 --> 02:05:09.370
some sort of a rush.
Yeah,
definitely.
Panties.
Oh,

2052
02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:12.590
hey,
have you ever heard of fecal transplants?
Yes.
Yeah.

2053
02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:14.490
I mean it sort of goes back to the,

2054
02:05:14.491 --> 02:05:17.240
we were talking about a biological thing really interesting.
Well,

2055
02:05:17.241 --> 02:05:20.540
it's fascinating how many things it cures and how many people have like real

2056
02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:25.550
thousand people die from a c difficile infestation every year.

2057
02:05:25.770 --> 02:05:27.450
And with fecal transplant,

2058
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:32.790
98% recovery rate within hours.
Nuts.

2059
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:37.080
It's crazy.
Then hours.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
The biological organism,

2060
02:05:37.081 --> 02:05:39.780
the idea of the biological organism being an individual,

2061
02:05:39.781 --> 02:05:43.530
it's been completely debunked.
Like that's what probiotics are all about.

2062
02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:47.440
I'm a big fan of probiotics.
I drink,
whereas it,
and I'm bringing,

2063
02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:51.270
it must have left in my car.
I drink a Kombucha every day.

2064
02:05:51.271 --> 02:05:54.630
I drink that shit like water.
I drink two or three of them a day.
Well,

2065
02:05:54.631 --> 02:05:59.300
I'm a big fan.
I mean I spent a lot of my younger years traveling,
you know,

2066
02:05:59.301 --> 02:06:04.290
and in Central America and Asia and stuff.
And uh,
like when I'm in America,

2067
02:06:04.291 --> 02:06:08.550
I put on weight now part of it's that,
you know,
the food and I drink beer,

2068
02:06:08.551 --> 02:06:12.660
probably more beer.
The sir,
you know,
here you get a beer.
It's a pint.
Spain,

2069
02:06:12.661 --> 02:06:17.490
you get a beer,
it's about half a pint.
Real.
Yeah,
it's a cognac.
So again,
Spain,

2070
02:06:17.491 --> 02:06:22.320
it's just a different five servings of everything or smaller,
higher quality,

2071
02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:24.540
like really good and tasty but small.

2072
02:06:24.990 --> 02:06:28.750
So you're still allowed grass fed food too.
Like you know,

2073
02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:33.000
you don't get that corn fed fucking Monsanto,
Gmos,
you know,

2074
02:06:33.001 --> 02:06:37.260
that whole thing there.
They're kicked out of a lot of countries.
Um,
but yeah,

2075
02:06:37.261 --> 02:06:38.940
no in pesticides,

2076
02:06:38.941 --> 02:06:43.430
a friend of mine's in the wine importation business and he distributes,
um,

2077
02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:45.890
organic wines and he said he was in,

2078
02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:48.180
I don't know if it was Spain or France and he was like,
you know,

2079
02:06:48.210 --> 02:06:51.960
you guys should get organic certified,
you know,
we could charge more.

2080
02:06:51.961 --> 02:06:54.180
And they're like,
what are you talking about?
Like,

2081
02:06:54.181 --> 02:06:58.560
we would never put pesticides on our grapes,
you know,
like,
that's crazy.

2082
02:06:58.590 --> 02:07:03.360
Like we don't need to say it.
Like nobody would do that.
Right.
So it's a,

2083
02:07:03.361 --> 02:07:06.120
it's a very different culture.
But I think that the,

2084
02:07:06.450 --> 02:07:11.450
because the cheeses and the things are alive there can't import the ham even you

2085
02:07:11.791 --> 02:07:16.500
can't import Spanish.
Uh,
I guess now they've changed it.
You can start.

2086
02:07:17.010 --> 02:07:20.420
Um,
but uh,
yeah,
food is alive.
So the microbiome,

2087
02:07:20.730 --> 02:07:25.290
the microbiome is very different.
Yeah.
I go to India,
I lose weight quickly.

2088
02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:27.330
Part of it's cause I have fucking dysentery.

2089
02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:34.020
Five is because you feel bad cause everybody else is starving.
Yeah.

2090
02:07:34.530 --> 02:07:36.130
There was an article recently about

2091
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:40.150
<v 2>a gray market foods in New York City and um,
I forget,</v>

2092
02:07:40.210 --> 02:07:43.150
oh it was something I read online and a,
it might've been from dig,

2093
02:07:43.180 --> 02:07:45.280
see if you could find it on dig.
I think it is from dig.

2094
02:07:45.670 --> 02:07:49.690
That's where I get a lot of my um,
interesting news stories.
But um,

2095
02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:53.380
they were talking about this one particular type of cheese that is very

2096
02:07:53.381 --> 02:07:55.570
difficult to get and um,
it's,

2097
02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:59.410
it's cured with cheese mites like these,
these mites.

2098
02:07:59.530 --> 02:08:03.850
And if the Mites are of a certain number per cheese,

2099
02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:07.570
it becomes illegal to import into America.
Like,
it's like very sketchy,

2100
02:08:07.571 --> 02:08:11.980
like how you do it,
but over in France or wherever the fuck they grow,

2101
02:08:11.981 --> 02:08:14.140
this cheese where it's really popular,

2102
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:17.560
it just gets fucking lousy with Mike and that,

2103
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:21.730
that's where you get the real flavor of this cheese.
And it's like a nutty,

2104
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:24.460
sort of a sweet taste to this cheese.

2105
02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:27.340
And a lot of it is attributed to the fact that,
first of all,

2106
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:29.200
they don't use homogenizer.

2107
02:08:29.201 --> 02:08:31.810
Pasteurized milk is raw milk when they make their tunes,

2108
02:08:31.811 --> 02:08:33.820
which is the way the make the best cheese,

2109
02:08:33.980 --> 02:08:38.080
he keeps the enzymes in it and then they're not scared of all these funky

2110
02:08:38.081 --> 02:08:41.890
organisms.
Yeah.
This is it.
The gray market foods.
If you scroll down,

2111
02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:43.120
you'll see that cheese.

2112
02:08:43.121 --> 02:08:47.380
It's a sort of a like a orange looking weird fucking cheese.

2113
02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:52.030
That's it right there.
Oh yeah.
That stuff.
And if you,
uh,

2114
02:08:52.090 --> 02:08:55.900
make that a little larger so we can read it.
It's a,

2115
02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:59.530
it's looks really weird,
but this guy was talking about how good it tasted.

2116
02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:05.020
It's a,
the unique way they alter the aging process.
The presence of Mites.

2117
02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:09.190
FDA single does cheese out as a potential public health hazard.

2118
02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:13.370
How do you say it?
[inaudible]

2119
02:09:13.930 --> 02:09:18.930
has been banned and made it illegal for sale in the U and and digit indignant

2120
02:09:20.410 --> 02:09:24.550
consumers.
Staged protests.
Yeah,
it looks cool.

2121
02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:27.410
I like to try piece that.
I've definitely had that.
Yeah.

2122
02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:31.240
It's one of the things we did on fear factor to make things more disgusting was

2123
02:09:31.241 --> 02:09:32.770
we used really expensive cheese.

2124
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:36.310
We mixed really expensive cheese in with some of the stuff to give it this

2125
02:09:36.311 --> 02:09:41.050
horrible fucking rotting smell and there's a expensive cheese,

2126
02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:45.160
what do they call it?
Cheese place.
There's a name for one of those places,

2127
02:09:46.330 --> 02:09:47.163
I don't know what's called,

2128
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:51.880
but they had a cheese place in Beverly hills and so we used to send these people

2129
02:09:51.881 --> 02:09:56.560
that work for fear factor to Beverly hills is super expensive cheese place and

2130
02:09:56.561 --> 02:09:57.940
buy this really expensive,

2131
02:09:57.941 --> 02:10:02.320
hard to get cheese and it's stunk like death and we would pour that onto

2132
02:10:02.321 --> 02:10:05.580
whatever the fuck they had to eat and they would make them more,
more repulse.

2133
02:10:05.590 --> 02:10:09.880
Do you ever have like French people on now?
They'd be like,
Ooh,
la La.
Well,

2134
02:10:09.881 --> 02:10:11.310
Filipinos,
I have,
I've,

2135
02:10:11.311 --> 02:10:14.410
I've a bunch of friends that are Filipino and they would always be like,

2136
02:10:14.411 --> 02:10:17.500
as we serve people balut and Balut is a,

2137
02:10:17.501 --> 02:10:19.660
a a chicken or a duck embryo.

2138
02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:22.730
It's like the full little embryos in there and they'd eat the,

2139
02:10:22.740 --> 02:10:25.930
and they were like,
that's,
we love that.
Like get me a show.

2140
02:10:26.290 --> 02:10:30.370
You have heard of Anthony Bordain on the show?
On this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's cool.

2141
02:10:30.371 --> 02:10:33.620
I'd love to meet him sometime.
He's a great guy.
Yeah,
he's a,

2142
02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:37.460
he's an interesting character.
He'll anything.
Yeah.
Well he's um,

2143
02:10:37.490 --> 02:10:41.630
he's gotten like super into Jujitsu to the point where freight trains every day

2144
02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:46.310
with Hensville.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Every day.
Sometimes twice a day.
Yeah.

2145
02:10:46.370 --> 02:10:51.080
And his wife and his kid,
he's 58 years old.
He started at 58.
Now he's got,

2146
02:10:51.081 --> 02:10:54.050
he just earned his blue belt.
Oh,
it just started recently.
Yeah.

2147
02:10:54.051 --> 02:10:57.770
Like within a year ago.
Oh,
I thought there was a long term thing with,
no,
no,

2148
02:10:57.771 --> 02:10:59.090
it's really recent.
Really.

2149
02:10:59.170 --> 02:11:02.960
Cause when I like risking getting hurt when you start something like that old,

2150
02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:05.990
well it depends on how you do it.
And it depends on who you do it with.

2151
02:11:05.991 --> 02:11:06.860
But absolutely.

2152
02:11:07.690 --> 02:11:11.030
You mean if you have bad training partners you can definitely get hurt,

2153
02:11:11.031 --> 02:11:12.200
but you can definitely get hurt.

2154
02:11:12.201 --> 02:11:15.500
Even with good training partners cause weird shit happens.
You know,

2155
02:11:15.501 --> 02:11:18.620
you roll over on an ankle,
you blow some tendons out and your knee,

2156
02:11:18.621 --> 02:11:22.520
you fuck up disc in your back.
It's all potential.
It's definitely not,

2157
02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:26.450
it's not fucking video games.
You know,
it's,
it's real life.

2158
02:11:26.570 --> 02:11:27.770
It's definitely dangerous.

2159
02:11:27.771 --> 02:11:32.771
Especially for a guy who's 58 who has no background of athleticism at all and

2160
02:11:34.911 --> 02:11:39.020
all of a sudden starts at a very advanced age and becomes completely obsessed

2161
02:11:39.021 --> 02:11:41.330
with it.
Yeah,
it's cool.
Yeah,
it is cool.

2162
02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:45.670
His original show that no reservation show really uh,

2163
02:11:45.890 --> 02:11:50.890
got me into the idea of food as an art form cause I just thought of food is

2164
02:11:50.961 --> 02:11:53.480
being,
well that's good foods.
Good.
This is good.
Right?

2165
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:56.720
That place is good to eat at.
I didn't think of it as like,
oh,

2166
02:11:56.721 --> 02:12:00.230
this guy's making art that you taste like when,

2167
02:12:00.231 --> 02:12:04.690
so when you eat a great meal,
like that experience at central experiences,

2168
02:12:04.691 --> 02:12:06.530
the pleasurable experiences,
art,

2169
02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:10.490
it's like someone's art is giving you pleasure through your taste buds.

2170
02:12:11.140 --> 02:12:14.330
It's three smells.
And you know,
like when you have a really good meal,

2171
02:12:14.331 --> 02:12:16.730
you smell it,
you eat it.
Like there's an art to that.

2172
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:20.210
I never really considered it that way until I watched his show.
And again,

2173
02:12:20.211 --> 02:12:25.170
that's a very European approach to food.
You know America food is fuel.
Yeah.

2174
02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:29.360
Shove that sandwich down your throat and get back to work.
Yeah.
Not In Spain,
man.

2175
02:12:29.420 --> 02:12:32.120
That's that.
Or France or Italy.
Yeah.

2176
02:12:32.690 --> 02:12:35.570
I have a buddy who's an athlete and he just,
he all,

2177
02:12:35.571 --> 02:12:38.270
he thinks about his food is fuel.
He goes,
I don't even care what it tastes like.

2178
02:12:38.271 --> 02:12:41.960
I just eat it.
He goes,
I'm just saying,
just want food is fuel.
And I'm like,

2179
02:12:41.961 --> 02:12:45.140
what soylent?
You heard about that?
Well,

2180
02:12:45.141 --> 02:12:49.070
soylent green or that movie,
they named it after that.
What is it?

2181
02:12:49.190 --> 02:12:52.910
It's these guys in Silicon Valley who are coding you,
right?
And they're like,

2182
02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:55.550
well,
I just want to work 24 hours.
I don't want to stop and eat.

2183
02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:57.710
It's a waste of time.
And so they came up,

2184
02:12:57.711 --> 02:13:01.550
they like developed this food source,

2185
02:13:01.551 --> 02:13:05.840
this Gorp that you just like squeeze out of a tube and it's got everything you

2186
02:13:05.841 --> 02:13:10.370
need and Oh,
one year I'll,
yeah.
Soylent

2187
02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:15.770
warrant.
So it's,
yeah,
you just like drink him.
Be Good for you though.

2188
02:13:16.930 --> 02:13:17.290
Look at that.

2189
02:13:17.290 --> 02:13:21.810
29 bucks a month and modular sweet protein that's going to make you grow to,

2190
02:13:21.811 --> 02:13:26.290
it's exactly the vitamins and minerals.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2191
02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:29.870
But what about,
yeah,
it's just weird.
Where's the pleasure?
There's no pleasure.

2192
02:13:30.170 --> 02:13:32.130
That's just nasty.
It's one

2193
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:34.680
<v 0>thing if you're a fucking astronaut,
you gotta survive in the space station,</v>

2194
02:13:34.681 --> 02:13:37.890
which stuff you squirt in your mouth.
But this is like,

2195
02:13:37.891 --> 02:13:41.610
you have the abundance of the earth and you choose to squirt,

2196
02:13:41.611 --> 02:13:45.600
paste in your mouth instead.
We'll see.
Maybe this is part of,
you know,

2197
02:13:45.601 --> 02:13:47.970
this is this movement you were talking about,
right?

2198
02:13:47.971 --> 02:13:52.971
Because getting us to eat shit that doesn't take up space.

2199
02:13:54.871 --> 02:13:58.590
And we don't need clean air and we don't need healthy oceans.
You know,

2200
02:13:59.130 --> 02:14:03.960
that's two,
that's in the interest of the technology,
right?

2201
02:14:03.961 --> 02:14:07.020
If,
if,
if you see that that's where we're going,

2202
02:14:07.021 --> 02:14:08.550
if you think that that's where we're going,

2203
02:14:08.551 --> 02:14:12.240
then a lot of these things start to fall into place and make sense in a weird

2204
02:14:12.241 --> 02:14:13.530
way.
I mean,

2205
02:14:13.531 --> 02:14:18.531
I read the other day that the tuna stocks in the Pacific Ocean or down like 40%

2206
02:14:19.471 --> 02:14:24.360
in the last 20 years.
Incredible.
The stuff you receipt,
Jiro Dreams of Sushi.

2207
02:14:24.690 --> 02:14:28.320
You know what?
I've got it on.
Someone gave it to,
I haven't seen it,

2208
02:14:28.350 --> 02:14:31.460
but I resisted for a long time.
Can people kept telling me how bad it was.

2209
02:14:31.461 --> 02:14:34.140
I'm like,
whatever.
It's a fucking guy making Sushi who gives a shit.

2210
02:14:34.710 --> 02:14:36.570
But it's great.
It's really great.

2211
02:14:36.630 --> 02:14:41.630
And one of the things that they show in this movie is when he was young,

2212
02:14:42.151 --> 02:14:45.030
what,
what it would be like going to the fish market in Japan,

2213
02:14:45.330 --> 02:14:48.660
just fucking stacks of tuna and the tuna was so abundant.

2214
02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:52.900
And then the over fishing has made a massive impact on the,

2215
02:14:53.010 --> 02:14:55.440
on the fish supplies.
And we've literally,

2216
02:14:55.670 --> 02:14:59.970
I mean you look at how God damn big the ocean is the fact that we put a dent in

2217
02:14:59.971 --> 02:15:02.670
it at all.
It's just shocking.
More than a dent.

2218
02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:07.860
We're collapsing the shoulders of the fucking earth surface is lastic size of

2219
02:15:07.951 --> 02:15:11.970
Texas.
Fuck.
Cause I think it's even bigger than that.
Really?
Yeah.

2220
02:15:11.971 --> 02:15:16.230
And this kid has developed a,
I don't know if it's um,

2221
02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:18.480
it's an actual functional machine,

2222
02:15:18.481 --> 02:15:22.280
but he's developed some sort of advice to clean up the ocean Kimmer kind of

2223
02:15:22.290 --> 02:15:24.470
thing that suck the plastic out.
Well,

2224
02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:28.560
you got to think plastic once it becomes a valuable resource of someone figures

2225
02:15:28.561 --> 02:15:32.220
out how to take it out of the ocean.
If it was gold floating around out there,

2226
02:15:32.221 --> 02:15:36.020
we would have a million ships that are fighting over this to try to get in.

2227
02:15:36.070 --> 02:15:38.880
Like if Russia and the United States found gold,

2228
02:15:39.150 --> 02:15:42.990
gold particles circling around the billions and trillions of dollars worth,
boy,

2229
02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:43.291
they would,

2230
02:15:43.291 --> 02:15:46.680
couldn't wait to plant a flag in the middle of the ocean to suck all this gold

2231
02:15:46.681 --> 02:15:51.000
out of the water because it's plastic.
Or like I got plastic right here,
dude,

2232
02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:54.630
I don't need the ocean plastic.
Well that's why you need the government,
you know,

2233
02:15:54.660 --> 02:15:59.010
cause the government can create those artificial incentives.
Pay For cobras,

2234
02:15:59.610 --> 02:16:03.780
you know,
pay for plastic.
I think that uh,
that's the,

2235
02:16:03.781 --> 02:16:08.400
the government being a solution.
It's a beautiful idea but doesn't really work.

2236
02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:09.900
Yeah.
Yeah.

2237
02:16:09.930 --> 02:16:14.790
Well be nice if the government was completely altruistic and enlightened on the

2238
02:16:14.791 --> 02:16:17.490
balls of thing.
Okay.
Going back to,
we were talking about earlier,

2239
02:16:17.491 --> 02:16:22.491
if we had direct voting and direct taxation where you can say like,

2240
02:16:23.671 --> 02:16:26.310
okay,
I'm paying my taxes this year.
It's 20 grand.

2241
02:16:26.580 --> 02:16:30.160
I won five grand to go to education five grand to,
you know,
helping

2242
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:33.640
<v 4>poor people five grand or whatever,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Nothing to the military.</v>

2243
02:16:33.641 --> 02:16:36.550
If you could actually,
or at least have some,

2244
02:16:36.610 --> 02:16:40.960
some way of registering what people want their money to go toward,

2245
02:16:41.350 --> 02:16:44.440
you know,
you'd have a much more responsive representative government

2246
02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:48.840
<v 3>if they had an educated decision making process.
Yeah.</v>

2247
02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:52.870
You really knew like,
well,
what kind of a threat are we under?

2248
02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:54.400
How much military do we really need?

2249
02:16:54.610 --> 02:16:58.960
Because if we don't need any military at all,
if there's no threat whatsoever,

2250
02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:01.330
well then that would be an appropriate way to respond.

2251
02:17:01.331 --> 02:17:04.910
But what if they couldn't tell us how much threat there really was and what if

2252
02:17:05.140 --> 02:17:09.130
people had this a idealistic idea of how the rest of the world functions,

2253
02:17:09.131 --> 02:17:12.060
but meanwhile,
there really is a need for the military.
Yeah.

2254
02:17:12.340 --> 02:17:14.740
I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle there.

2255
02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:18.700
I don't think that the world is this beautiful place that we need to not worry

2256
02:17:18.701 --> 02:17:21.940
about at all.
And then we don't need any military that just doesn't.

2257
02:17:22.210 --> 02:17:26.560
I watched those isis videos on youtube.
I just,
I'm not believe they're out there.

2258
02:17:26.561 --> 02:17:29.470
This be nasty.
There's a lot of people out there that are fucking crazy.

2259
02:17:29.471 --> 02:17:33.130
There's a lot of nutty fucking people that are killing people and would love to

2260
02:17:33.131 --> 02:17:35.680
kill more.
There's just always going to be that way.

2261
02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:40.660
And I think that like what we're talking about,
I think there's a,

2262
02:17:40.661 --> 02:17:45.160
there's a,
a push and a pull in this life.
And I think like,
you know,

2263
02:17:45.161 --> 02:17:48.100
we were talking about tides coming in and tides going out and population's

2264
02:17:48.101 --> 02:17:52.840
dropping and an increasing,
I think there's a need for resistance in some ways.

2265
02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:57.990
And I think that there's almost a need for bad things in order to inspire good

2266
02:17:58.331 --> 02:18:02.830
things.
Like we have to see the evil of something like isis or something,

2267
02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:06.100
you know,
fill in the blank,
a Joseph Kony,
the,
the,
you know,

2268
02:18:06.101 --> 02:18:09.580
the Congo dictators and evil war lords.

2269
02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:12.090
We need to see things like,
you know,

2270
02:18:12.130 --> 02:18:16.330
EDI mean we need to see horrific things like Pol Pot.
We need to,

2271
02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:20.300
we need to be aware of that in order to almost promote the,

2272
02:18:20.301 --> 02:18:21.610
the opposite of it.

2273
02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:27.030
<v 4>But what I would argue is that every one of those things that you mentioned is a</v>

2274
02:18:29.351 --> 02:18:33.910
response to something earlier.

2275
02:18:34.330 --> 02:18:39.330
Like Pol Pot is a response to the Vietnam War and the destruction of Cambodia by

2276
02:18:40.690 --> 02:18:43.360
Nixon and Kissinger.
And you know,
um,

2277
02:18:43.630 --> 02:18:48.630
Coney is a response to the Congo having been exploited for ivory and then,

2278
02:18:48.671 --> 02:18:51.520
you know,
minerals within our phones.
And you know,

2279
02:18:51.750 --> 02:18:56.750
it's like every one of these things arises out of a colonial exploitation.

2280
02:18:57.340 --> 02:19:01.480
So,
you know,
we're saying,
you know,
Paul Potts,
evil,
well,

2281
02:19:01.481 --> 02:19:06.481
but pull pod is a response to evil that we're not often recognizes as evil

2282
02:19:08.021 --> 02:19:10.420
because it's coming from us coming from our side.

2283
02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:14.890
So I just feel like everybody who does something really nasty,

2284
02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:18.760
they think they're doing good.
You know what I mean?

2285
02:19:18.761 --> 02:19:22.120
Like those guys in Isis,
they think they're good.
Right?

2286
02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:25.530
They're doing it for a law.
Yeah.
Or they're doing it for,
you know,
in,

2287
02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:28.010
in revenge for the bombing

2288
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:31.040
<v 2>or,
right.
I mean,
it's this process.
So,</v>

2289
02:19:31.550 --> 02:19:34.310
so I agree with you.
I mean,
I'm not,

2290
02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:39.170
I'm not an anarchist and I'm not crazy.
So I do feel like,
you know,

2291
02:19:39.171 --> 02:19:44.120
you've gotta be ready to fight to defend yourself.
But on the other hand it,

2292
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:45.680
I sort of agree with,
you know,

2293
02:19:45.681 --> 02:19:49.760
the Gandhis and the Martin Luther King and that whole line civil disobedience,

2294
02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:54.740
the rose great essay that like the only way to really end violence is to just

2295
02:19:54.741 --> 02:19:58.280
not participate in it because the minute you participate in it,

2296
02:19:58.310 --> 02:20:02.210
then it's the cycle.
It's true.
Yeah.
It's unavoidable hands.
Yeah.

2297
02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:05.270
I mean that's sort of inarguable really.
Right.

2298
02:20:05.540 --> 02:20:10.540
But if you do not participate and your loved ones are slaughtered before your

2299
02:20:10.881 --> 02:20:12.410
eyes,
then what?

2300
02:20:12.700 --> 02:20:16.550
Like should you have acted to stop that from happening and is a certain amount

2301
02:20:16.551 --> 02:20:21.551
of violence did justified in order to promote a higher ethical and moral

2302
02:20:22.071 --> 02:20:25.340
standard for the culture to eliminate people who don't abide by those things.

2303
02:20:25.340 --> 02:20:29.000
But you would have to have very strict right interpretations of this and you'd

2304
02:20:29.001 --> 02:20:33.050
have to have very strict rules of engagement.
And we clearly don't have that.

2305
02:20:33.470 --> 02:20:38.120
Yeah.
And I wonder if we ever did it feels like it was better.
Right?

2306
02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:38.571
Doesn't it?

2307
02:20:38.571 --> 02:20:43.340
Like in talks talking about police in the u s like before the war on drugs,

2308
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:48.470
it seems like cops were cool.
They weren't the enemy.
I thought that too.

2309
02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:49.940
But when you talk to cops,

2310
02:20:49.941 --> 02:20:54.170
like it seems like poverty and drugs and crime,

2311
02:20:54.200 --> 02:20:56.210
they're kind of always together.
Desperate.

2312
02:20:56.390 --> 02:20:58.670
There's a great documentary that I'm watching right now called,

2313
02:20:58.700 --> 02:21:02.880
I think it's called the seven five.
I'm Nick Depaulo told me about it.

2314
02:21:02.910 --> 02:21:07.460
He actually talked about on Arusha fears a podcast and then I went and got it.

2315
02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:12.530
Um,
what is it called?
It's called a,
yeah,

2316
02:21:12.531 --> 02:21:17.200
it's called the seven five.
And it's,

2317
02:21:17.201 --> 02:21:21.760
um,
it's all about this really corrupt precinct.

2318
02:21:22.090 --> 02:21:26.410
And I'm in New York City and,
uh,
the 19 I guess,

2319
02:21:26.411 --> 02:21:29.680
I think it's the 1970s,
but it's,
fuck,
that's it right there.

2320
02:21:29.710 --> 02:21:31.270
It's fucking incredible.

2321
02:21:32.530 --> 02:21:35.320
It's so God damn crazy.

2322
02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:39.340
This Guy Michael Dowd,
who I don't know his history,
I need to,

2323
02:21:39.341 --> 02:21:40.840
after the documentary is over,

2324
02:21:40.841 --> 02:21:45.460
I'm going to Google him and find out what his history was.
But he's hilarious.

2325
02:21:45.770 --> 02:21:49.630
He's out now,
I guess he's wearing civilian clothes is not a prisoner.

2326
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.800
And he just,

2327
02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:55.030
he testified about all the corruption that he was involved in and you know,

2328
02:21:55.031 --> 02:21:56.440
all the shit that he was,
and then they,

2329
02:21:56.620 --> 02:21:59.890
they start reenacting it and talking about it in the documentary along with

2330
02:21:59.891 --> 02:22:03.760
facts and the different people in different players involved and like,
Whoa,

2331
02:22:04.090 --> 02:22:06.190
just completely out of control.

2332
02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:11.380
It's a totally out of control crime and corruption and drugs and you know,

2333
02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:15.640
so this is pre war on drugs is 1970s and it just,

2334
02:22:15.641 --> 02:22:17.260
I guess kind of pre war on drugs,

2335
02:22:17.261 --> 02:22:20.180
but Nixon sort of instituted a war on drugs and yeah,

2336
02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:23.340
they really instituted a war on drugs.
Uh,

2337
02:22:23.410 --> 02:22:28.410
essentially when they pass the sweeping psychedelic act of 1970 when they made

2338
02:22:28.861 --> 02:22:30.780
essentially everything psychoactive,
illegal,

2339
02:22:30.781 --> 02:22:35.100
all the different mushrooms and LSD and many people don't even know that.

2340
02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:38.150
But prior to 1970,
all that stuff was legal.
You,

2341
02:22:38.410 --> 02:22:42.060
there was one of the big issues with the term toony and turnout,
you know,

2342
02:22:43.350 --> 02:22:47.450
Timothy Leary's ideas was it was legal,
you could actually be in it.

2343
02:22:47.451 --> 02:22:49.740
And it was effective.
I mean,
Lsd,

2344
02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:55.020
one of my favorite fun facts about Lsd is that it was mostly used,
uh,

2345
02:22:55.050 --> 02:23:00.030
initially by psychiatrists to get insights into what it was like to be

2346
02:23:00.031 --> 02:23:04.650
psychotic.
It was called a psychotomimetic.
And in other words,

2347
02:23:04.651 --> 02:23:07.050
it mimes the effects of psychosis.

2348
02:23:07.380 --> 02:23:11.910
So psychiatrists who dealt with psychotic people is,
my wife does,

2349
02:23:12.090 --> 02:23:16.290
would take LSD to like,
oh,
this is what it must be like to be them.

2350
02:23:16.291 --> 02:23:20.070
This is what it's like to hear voices into lose touch with reality and to have

2351
02:23:20.071 --> 02:23:22.350
all this overwhelming input.
And,

2352
02:23:22.910 --> 02:23:26.490
and then they would go back to their patients with a greater compassion and

2353
02:23:26.491 --> 02:23:29.380
understanding because they were like,
I get it.
I know what you're,
you know,

2354
02:23:29.430 --> 02:23:32.960
what you're going through.
That's fascinating.
Which is what a Shaman does,
right?

2355
02:23:33.010 --> 02:23:34.380
Like in shamanic practices,

2356
02:23:34.381 --> 02:23:38.700
often it's the shaman who takes the drugs in order to change his or her

2357
02:23:38.701 --> 02:23:42.000
consciousness to help you with whatever you're dealing with.
I mean,

2358
02:23:42.001 --> 02:23:45.270
that's such a beautiful sort of noble,

2359
02:23:45.330 --> 02:23:48.350
a approach to healing.
I was,
uh,

2360
02:23:48.390 --> 02:23:53.390
driving yesterday and I drove past a short bus and all those little buses where

2361
02:23:54.120 --> 02:23:57.840
kids are troubled.
And there was this little boy,
uh,

2362
02:23:57.930 --> 02:23:59.280
he looked like he was Indian.

2363
02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:03.060
He looked like he was probably about nine or 10 years old and,
uh,

2364
02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:08.270
he was staring at his hands and he was like moving his hands around and nodding

2365
02:24:09.001 --> 02:24:12.600
and going back and forth.
He was like,
at first I thought it was just playing,

2366
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:17.180
you know,
I thought it was just a kid in a boss who was bored.
And then,
um,

2367
02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:21.660
as I was stuck there at the red light and I'm looking in this window and he was

2368
02:24:21.690 --> 02:24:26.370
making noises and his face and he was moving his mouth around and he was just

2369
02:24:26.371 --> 02:24:30.360
staring at his fingers and I was realizing like,
oh,
this kid's kind of fucked up.

2370
02:24:30.390 --> 02:24:34.080
There's something wrong with them.
And then I started thinking,
man,
I was only,

2371
02:24:34.081 --> 02:24:36.780
it was only for,
you know,
whatever it takes for a light to change.

2372
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:40.530
I was thinking like,
what,
what,
what does this guy seeing?
Like what is he seeing?

2373
02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:44.490
He's obviously not seeing things that normal people see or experiencing it in

2374
02:24:44.491 --> 02:24:47.550
the same way that a quote unquote normal person would.

2375
02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:51.870
But he was moving his fingers around and staring at it and bouncing back and

2376
02:24:51.871 --> 02:24:55.620
forth and like,
what is this kid's trip like?
What does this light for him?
Is it,

2377
02:24:55.880 --> 02:24:59.550
does he have some abnormal levels of neurochemicals?

2378
02:24:59.610 --> 02:25:04.140
Like what is causing him to have this experience?
Whatever in his circuitry,

2379
02:25:04.141 --> 02:25:06.090
like what is it?
But it was,
you know,

2380
02:25:06.270 --> 02:25:10.580
it was sad but fascinating at the same time.
I mean,

2381
02:25:10.581 --> 02:25:14.520
I don't know what he was suffering from,
but it was clearly something,
well,

2382
02:25:14.521 --> 02:25:18.750
my castle does.
Um,
she's really interesting.
She,

2383
02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:23.770
she loves psychotics.
That's her favorite population to work with,
which are,

2384
02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:23.980
you

2385
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:27.250
<v 0>know,
psychotics are the people who have lost touch with reality.</v>

2386
02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:30.430
So that kid may have been having a psychotic break or,
you know,

2387
02:25:30.431 --> 02:25:33.190
who knows what his thing is.
But I,

2388
02:25:33.191 --> 02:25:36.550
the first time I went into her office when I first met her,

2389
02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:40.370
it was like one flew over the cuckoo's nest.
Right.
You know,
like the,

2390
02:25:40.500 --> 02:25:44.380
the double doors,
the locking doors,
the grates over the windows,

2391
02:25:44.420 --> 02:25:49.210
high security people just like,
you know,
completely out of it.

2392
02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:53.650
And she loves those people cause she says they're honest,

2393
02:25:53.740 --> 02:25:56.830
they're completely honest and they don't lie.

2394
02:25:56.890 --> 02:26:00.040
And when she meets them,

2395
02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:03.520
and I've seen this happen in the street and it countless times at this point,

2396
02:26:03.940 --> 02:26:07.660
she laughs,
she just laughs and they,

2397
02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:09.520
cause they know they're crazy.

2398
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:15.150
There's part of them that's observing and they know they're acting ridiculous

2399
02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:17.230
and they're like shouting at,
you know,

2400
02:26:17.231 --> 02:26:19.810
something that they know isn't there but they can't help it.

2401
02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:24.220
So she laughs and it's very friendly,
open way and,

2402
02:26:24.670 --> 02:26:28.290
and they like,
oh,
like you get it,
there's,

2403
02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:29.710
they have this rapport.

2404
02:26:29.711 --> 02:26:32.590
It's a really beautiful thing I've never seen happen before,

2405
02:26:33.070 --> 02:26:36.970
but it's almost like a shamonic kind of connection she has with people.

2406
02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:40.150
But you know,
she,
she sees kids like that and she's just like,
oh,

2407
02:26:40.151 --> 02:26:43.600
I love those kids.
I love how she's not afraid of them at all.

2408
02:26:43.601 --> 02:26:46.930
She's afraid to normal people because we're all lying,
you know,

2409
02:26:47.770 --> 02:26:50.870
she's not good at,
it's a weird thing.
As a psychiatry.

2410
02:26:50.871 --> 02:26:55.150
She's not good at seeing through bullshit.
She,
she smells it,
but she,

2411
02:26:55.390 --> 02:26:59.140
she just like fleas from it.
So she had was rather have it were bullshit.

2412
02:26:59.141 --> 02:27:01.090
It's not even an option.
So even on the towel,

2413
02:27:01.150 --> 02:27:05.110
she wants honesty and like if that means you're drooling and pissing down your

2414
02:27:05.111 --> 02:27:08.320
leg,
that's fine.
It's just that she doesn't care about that.
Lucky for me,

2415
02:27:08.350 --> 02:27:12.640
boy she and outlier.
Yes.
She's,
she's a bit of a nutcase herself,

2416
02:27:14.180 --> 02:27:16.890
you know,
in the best possible way.
I mean,
I often think like a,

2417
02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:19.000
someone who works in,
you know,
I'm a psychologist,

2418
02:27:19.001 --> 02:27:20.770
I spent a lot of time thinking about this stuff.

2419
02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:25.180
Somebody works in mental health is like a lifeguard,
you know,

2420
02:27:25.181 --> 02:27:30.070
and 99% of us are the lifeguard who stands on the beach.

2421
02:27:30.071 --> 02:27:34.300
And if you're in trouble,
they'll like throw you a a ring and wish you luck.

2422
02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:37.300
She dives in,
she goes right into the water,

2423
02:27:37.630 --> 02:27:42.220
which is really dangerous and very rare.
Um,
and one of the reasons,
honestly,

2424
02:27:42.221 --> 02:27:45.970
she's been on a break for a few years because it was blowing her mind there for

2425
02:27:45.971 --> 02:27:47.020
a while.
Wow.

2426
02:27:47.410 --> 02:27:51.370
So it was good to be able to fuck off to America for,

2427
02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:54.580
I would imagine the burden of that would be pretty intense.

2428
02:27:54.850 --> 02:27:58.600
When I was a fucking my fucking off my way through college,

2429
02:27:59.170 --> 02:28:00.270
I shouldn't say fucking my way through.

2430
02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:05.010
I didn't really do much fucking college unfortunately.
But uh,
I got it.

2431
02:28:05.011 --> 02:28:08.640
I went to Umass Boston and uh,

2432
02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:10.570
I basically was wasting my time there.

2433
02:28:10.571 --> 02:28:12.760
I was only really going because I didn't want to be a loser.

2434
02:28:13.270 --> 02:28:17.410
I go there cause I would tell people,
oh,
I'm going to Umass Boston,
you know,

2435
02:28:17.710 --> 02:28:22.040
wasting my time when I was trying to think of what would be a career that

2436
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:23.330
<v 3>I would be interested in.</v>

2437
02:28:23.780 --> 02:28:28.780
Psychology was the only thing that interest me because I thought,

2438
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:31.160
well at the very least,

2439
02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:35.730
at least I kind of understand how to manage my own mind because a,

2440
02:28:35.731 --> 02:28:37.910
I obviously had a lot of troubles.

2441
02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:41.840
There was a lot going on in there that I was trying to always wrestle with

2442
02:28:41.870 --> 02:28:44.540
inside my head and I felt like it,

2443
02:28:44.930 --> 02:28:47.060
at least I do,

2444
02:28:47.061 --> 02:28:50.270
that I will have a greater understanding of my own problems.

2445
02:28:50.540 --> 02:28:51.950
But then I thought about it and I'd be like,

2446
02:28:51.951 --> 02:28:55.820
but I will be dealing with other people's fucking problems all the time.

2447
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:59.630
And I just don't have the patience for that.
I admire people who do,

2448
02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:02.260
but I'm not one of them.
I just,
I,
I,
there's,

2449
02:29:02.450 --> 02:29:07.400
I believe that that shit is contagious.
And I think that negative energy,

2450
02:29:07.970 --> 02:29:11.870
laziness,
slovenly behavior,
all that stuff wears on you.

2451
02:29:11.870 --> 02:29:15.530
Because I think we imitate our atmosphere far more than we want to admit.

2452
02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:20.210
And we become in sync with our atmosphere far more than we care to admit.

2453
02:29:20.211 --> 02:29:23.180
And if you're around a lot of really positive,
really healthy people,

2454
02:29:23.420 --> 02:29:26.690
you tend to gravitate towards positive,
healthy behavior.

2455
02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:30.410
But if you're around people that are constantly self sabotaging,
you'll,
you'll,

2456
02:29:30.470 --> 02:29:34.100
that becomes the standard that becomes the norm.
It's your culture.
It's yes.

2457
02:29:34.130 --> 02:29:36.350
And it's not,
it's not good for you.
And it's very,

2458
02:29:36.351 --> 02:29:39.680
very frustrating to me when I'm around people that are sabotaging themselves.

2459
02:29:39.890 --> 02:29:44.430
I get angry.
I get,
well,
you just fucking stop,
get your fucking shit together.
I,

2460
02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:49.100
which is not really a healthy way to approach them because it doesn't work.

2461
02:29:49.130 --> 02:29:51.110
You can't yell at someone and say,
get your shit together.

2462
02:29:51.111 --> 02:29:54.530
But it's almost like impulsive because I know that it's creeping into my brain.

2463
02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:56.960
Like you're spitting on me.
You fuck,
you're sick,

2464
02:29:57.270 --> 02:30:00.260
you're sneezing with your mouth over your mouth.
You're,

2465
02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:04.580
you're coughing in my face.
And that's what someone's doing when they're filling.

2466
02:30:04.600 --> 02:30:04.880
They're,

2467
02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:08.930
they're sabotaging their life in front of you consistently and continually and

2468
02:30:08.931 --> 02:30:13.280
they drag you into their world.
We'll fucking help me.
Like,
no,

2469
02:30:13.430 --> 02:30:17.900
you are a grown person.
Help yourself.
God Damn it and you get sucked into it.

2470
02:30:17.901 --> 02:30:20.360
You know,
like you,
okay,
I'm going to call you.
I'll call you later.

2471
02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:23.060
Then you have to call and check up on them and they're crying and like,

2472
02:30:23.061 --> 02:30:25.430
what the fuck?
You know,
it's like,

2473
02:30:25.740 --> 02:30:29.790
like when people don't get their shit together,
it becomes contagious.
And I,

2474
02:30:29.791 --> 02:30:34.580
I worry about that when it comes to psychology.
I worry like,

2475
02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:39.260
like people that are constantly dealing with other people's disasters and

2476
02:30:39.261 --> 02:30:43.160
fuckups if that's your day is just every day you're dealing with someone who

2477
02:30:43.161 --> 02:30:46.610
can't stop eating cake or they can't stop jerking off or they can't stop

2478
02:30:46.820 --> 02:30:49.850
whatever it is that they're hung up on.
Whatever craziness.

2479
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:55.100
I always feel like men in trying or even making an attempt to help those people,

2480
02:30:55.101 --> 02:31:00.101
you're sort of giving up a lot of your sovereignty when it comes to your own

2481
02:31:00.411 --> 02:31:05.030
established mental state.
Yeah.
Which is why,
you know,

2482
02:31:05.031 --> 02:31:10.031
concealed has got extremely firm boundaries and when we're like,

2483
02:31:11.170 --> 02:31:13.460
you know,
if we're hanging out with someone,
you know,

2484
02:31:13.461 --> 02:31:15.710
potential friends or whatever,
just people,
whatever,

2485
02:31:16.340 --> 02:31:19.980
if she detects something that's not

2486
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:24.770
<v 4>right,
she's just like,
yeah,
I'm going to go home.
And she's out.
Like,
Eh,</v>

2487
02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:28.470
she's not gonna she,
cause I think it's what you're describing.

2488
02:31:28.471 --> 02:31:33.471
She feels like if this isn't a clinical situation where I'm in charge,

2489
02:31:33.810 --> 02:31:38.580
then I feel she feels contaminated.
Whereas I feel more like,

2490
02:31:38.581 --> 02:31:41.430
yeah,
whatever.
You know,
Pete,
everybody's got their weird shit.

2491
02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:45.840
But then I find myself developing friendships with people and then a year or two

2492
02:31:45.841 --> 02:31:48.200
down the road it's like fuck,
you know,
they,

2493
02:31:48.201 --> 02:31:51.780
they weird out on me and like I didn't see that coming.
And she'll say,

2494
02:31:52.120 --> 02:31:55.910
are you kidding?
I saw that come in the day he met that guy.
Like why?
We just,

2495
02:31:55.920 --> 02:31:57.390
you know,
I tried to warn you,

2496
02:31:58.110 --> 02:32:02.010
<v 3>well there's some people that are undeniably toxic and by toxic it doesn't</v>

2497
02:32:02.011 --> 02:32:04.830
necessarily even mean that they're trying to harm you.
Right?

2498
02:32:04.860 --> 02:32:08.640
They might be toxic just by the fact that they're fucking so self indulgent and,

2499
02:32:08.641 --> 02:32:10.920
and they're,
they're,
they're always like,

2500
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:15.150
there's a lot of people that constantly want to talk about their own problems,

2501
02:32:15.151 --> 02:32:18.240
like their own problems take precedent over everything that's going on.

2502
02:32:18.420 --> 02:32:23.310
And it's just this constant examination of their own faults and they never get

2503
02:32:23.311 --> 02:32:26.000
better.
Those Fox,
those fuckers,
they,
they,

2504
02:32:26.001 --> 02:32:30.180
they constantly repeat the same problems.
And I think that a lot of them,

2505
02:32:30.480 --> 02:32:33.540
they have even addictions and that these addictions,

2506
02:32:33.541 --> 02:32:36.150
whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever the fuck it is,

2507
02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:38.720
those addictions they have are almost like,

2508
02:32:39.260 --> 02:32:43.620
it's like facilitates this need to talk about themselves and then problems,

2509
02:32:43.621 --> 02:32:47.850
they create more problems.
So they're constantly addressing their problems.

2510
02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:53.240
<v 4>Yeah,
I hear that.
And that's why she prefers psychotic.</v>

2511
02:32:53.260 --> 02:32:56.230
<v 3>It's cause they're not doing that.
Make sense?
They're crazy.</v>

2512
02:32:56.231 --> 02:33:00.670
They really are just a pain in the ass.
But psychotics,
they can't help it.

2513
02:33:01.180 --> 02:33:04.240
They're just like that.
They're born that way.
While to wrap it all up,

2514
02:33:04.241 --> 02:33:07.240
Chris Ryan and we fucking doomed.
When is this book coming out,
by the way?

2515
02:33:07.600 --> 02:33:11.080
Probably next summer.
Are you almost done with it or is it the editorial process?

2516
02:33:11.480 --> 02:33:15.110
<v 4>Not yet,
but within,
I'd say within a month I'm gonna,</v>

2517
02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:17.040
I'll turn it in and then fully

2518
02:33:17.130 --> 02:33:18.950
<v 3>the country and then when you turn it in,</v>

2519
02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:23.730
is it a bunch of fucking bean counters start going over your shit and deciding

2520
02:33:23.731 --> 02:33:28.050
which way it should go because you have to give up a little bit of creative

2521
02:33:28.590 --> 02:33:31.530
controlled in order to have it published.
Right.
Is that how it works?

2522
02:33:31.660 --> 02:33:36.490
<v 4>Yeah.
I mean it depends where you are in that world,
you know?</v>

2523
02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:39.850
I mean,
you know,
it's probably the same like with a comic,
right?

2524
02:33:39.851 --> 02:33:43.180
It's your first special.
The producers are going to have a lot to say,

2525
02:33:43.540 --> 02:33:46.930
is someone like you?
You can walk in and say,
no,
I'm going to do it this way,

2526
02:33:47.140 --> 02:33:47.900
take it or leave it.

2527
02:33:47.900 --> 02:33:50.180
<v 3>But even then,
like there was some bits that I like,</v>

2528
02:33:50.181 --> 02:33:53.630
comedy central wouldn't put on my last special.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
They were like,

2529
02:33:53.631 --> 02:33:56.920
you can't do that one touch this one.
We can't put that one on the air.
I'm like,

2530
02:33:57.760 --> 02:33:59.000
yeah,
I'll go love them.

2531
02:33:59.620 --> 02:34:03.280
<v 4>You could do a year in a position with your platform where you could just say,</v>

2532
02:34:03.281 --> 02:34:06.550
all right,
comedy central aisle,
you know what,
I'm going to pay tape,

2533
02:34:06.551 --> 02:34:11.110
it's myself and a small club in La and then distribute it through my podcast and

2534
02:34:11.111 --> 02:34:15.580
cut you guys out.
You could do that.
The earlier regime,
right?
Like

2535
02:34:15.630 --> 02:34:17.740
<v 3>the regime that they have now is really good,</v>

2536
02:34:17.860 --> 02:34:21.100
but they had an earlier regime and several years ago I had a conversation with

2537
02:34:21.101 --> 02:34:21.671
them over the phone.

2538
02:34:21.671 --> 02:34:25.120
We were going over material and in the middle of the conversation went,
stop,

2539
02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:28.150
stop,
stop.
We're done.
We're not going to do this.

2540
02:34:28.180 --> 02:34:30.640
Like they were saying like you've got to do this instead of that,

2541
02:34:30.641 --> 02:34:31.840
you can't say that instead of this.

2542
02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:36.450
And they were telling me as if like we're gonna create some sit-com together.

2543
02:34:36.451 --> 02:34:40.900
Right.
You know like it has I go,
this is like no you did.
That part has to be in,

2544
02:34:41.170 --> 02:34:42.460
because it's the whole point.

2545
02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:46.690
The whole point about telling the story of Noah and the Ark to an eight year old

2546
02:34:46.691 --> 02:34:50.640
retarded boy,
you have to have an 88 year old retired board.
Cause.

2547
02:34:50.641 --> 02:34:52.270
So the eight year old retarded boy goes,

2548
02:34:52.271 --> 02:34:55.690
well there's a lot of holes and neath doors and they were like,

2549
02:34:55.691 --> 02:34:58.380
you can't do that.
I'm just like,
well that's,
it has to be done.

2550
02:34:58.870 --> 02:35:02.310
You can't tell me what I can and can't do.
Like that's the whole point.
Right.

2551
02:35:02.350 --> 02:35:05.110
Are you saying that eight year old retired boys don't exist or are they just,

2552
02:35:05.111 --> 02:35:07.240
you can't ever discuss them?
Which one is it?

2553
02:35:07.270 --> 02:35:09.280
Because I'm not making fun of the eight year old retarded boy.

2554
02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:13.510
I'm saying the eight year old retired to boys too smart to buy the story of Noah

2555
02:35:13.511 --> 02:35:17.430
and the Ark.
Right.
And to them it was just the,
the vehicle was unacceptable.
Like,

2556
02:35:17.460 --> 02:35:19.770
well we're done.
We're done here.
Like,
well like,

2557
02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:22.420
well why don't you have it like an older brother?
I said that the,
the,
the,
the,

2558
02:35:22.430 --> 02:35:24.230
the,
the,
the,
the,
the no,

2559
02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:29.400
you're saying this because you want to save your Gig and your Gig is to like be

2560
02:35:30.311 --> 02:35:35.311
able to somehow or another justify what you've put on the air to the advertisers

2561
02:35:35.351 --> 02:35:39.030
or whoever the fuck is above you.
And like,

2562
02:35:39.490 --> 02:35:43.870
you can't do that with comedy.
Like if you may not,
you homogenize comedy,

2563
02:35:44.110 --> 02:35:46.720
you just develop.
Unless it's your thing,

2564
02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:49.480
like some people like that's how they think,
which is fine,

2565
02:35:49.870 --> 02:35:53.650
but they shouldn't be working in comedy.
Well,
he could be like Jim Gaffigan,

2566
02:35:53.770 --> 02:35:58.450
he's a hilarious guy,
but his comedy is very like anybody could laugh at it.

2567
02:35:58.750 --> 02:36:02.610
Brian Regan,
it's the same thing.
He's Hilarious,
but that is him.
You know,

2568
02:36:02.620 --> 02:36:06.370
there's always going to be pop music and some pop music is really fucking good.

2569
02:36:06.730 --> 02:36:10.720
And then there's always going to be just a dirty fucking nasty,

2570
02:36:11.230 --> 02:36:15.400
like music from the street,
which is also really good.
If that's what you're into.

2571
02:36:16.330 --> 02:36:20.380
You turned me on to Doug.
Stan hope,
talking about someone who just goes,

2572
02:36:20.530 --> 02:36:23.080
he's fantastic.
Yeah,
he's free.

2573
02:36:23.450 --> 02:36:26.770
And he's the opposite of what you're talking about.
Yeah.
He doesn't know.

2574
02:36:26.771 --> 02:36:30.340
You can't tell Doug what to do.
It's just,
it's not,
it's never going to happen.

2575
02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:34.840
He doesn't care.
He does.
All Doug needs is enough money to get by and he's done,

2576
02:36:34.990 --> 02:36:38.290
you know?
I mean,
he lives in this weird fucking town.
Bisbee Arizona,

2577
02:36:38.291 --> 02:36:41.390
seven miles from the border of Mexico.
It's this weird artists,

2578
02:36:41.450 --> 02:36:43.960
communities get this strangely painted house.

2579
02:36:44.170 --> 02:36:48.170
He invites people over his house for Super Bowl party,
like literally the,

2580
02:36:48.171 --> 02:36:52.540
the Internet.
He'll like put out a his address and people just come to his house.

2581
02:36:52.750 --> 02:36:56.260
He said 500 people over his house for Superbowl parties.
You didn't know.

2582
02:36:56.350 --> 02:37:01.060
459 of them.
I mean he's that nuts.
A lot of bean dip.

2583
02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:03.520
His girlfriend completely out of her fucking mind,

2584
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:08.200
like legitimately crazy on pills or names.
Bingo.
She shaves her head,

2585
02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:09.430
the hair that's left,

2586
02:37:09.431 --> 02:37:12.880
she puts blue paint on it and they fucking go out of the house and she's wearing

2587
02:37:12.881 --> 02:37:17.630
like socks on her arms.
She's nuts and that's,
that's his,
that's his reality.

2588
02:37:17.660 --> 02:37:18.110
He's,

2589
02:37:18.110 --> 02:37:22.610
he wears ironic suits and he gets upset because now like more people are wearing

2590
02:37:22.611 --> 02:37:26.150
these ironic suits and he's afraid that he's going to get lumped into these

2591
02:37:26.151 --> 02:37:30.800
categories of these people that are like trying to act as if they're onic by

2592
02:37:30.801 --> 02:37:33.770
wearing,
you know,
ridiculous suits.
He's a,
he's a,

2593
02:37:34.010 --> 02:37:36.230
he's a fucking national treasurer.
He really is.

2594
02:37:36.690 --> 02:37:40.520
It's so hard for someone to go that road.

2595
02:37:40.521 --> 02:37:45.350
So 100% committed that they come out in the other end at Doug's Tahoe most of

2596
02:37:45.351 --> 02:37:47.750
the time,
somewhere along the line they sell out.
Yeah,

2597
02:37:48.370 --> 02:37:53.340
<v 4>yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
But I mean as far as the public publishing thing,</v>

2598
02:37:53.370 --> 02:37:56.310
I'm,
because of the success of sex at dawn,

2599
02:37:56.311 --> 02:37:59.640
I'm think I'm in a position to sort of,
you know,

2600
02:38:00.030 --> 02:38:04.230
I've got leverage and,
and the guy,
the editor who um,

2601
02:38:04.950 --> 02:38:08.790
who acquired the book is the guy who edited sex at dawn.

2602
02:38:09.550 --> 02:38:14.070
He works different publisher.
He,
he quit and left.
He's with someone else.

2603
02:38:14.460 --> 02:38:17.420
So he's cool and he,
we know,
we've known each other for years and

2604
02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:19.870
<v 3>that's nice when you develop a relationship.</v>

2605
02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:21.940
I've heard of authors that have relationships,

2606
02:38:21.941 --> 02:38:25.520
they're editors and it's really great.
Yeah.
I had a book deal for awhile and uh,

2607
02:38:25.540 --> 02:38:27.730
it didn't go well.
It's the same thing as the comedy central thing.

2608
02:38:28.090 --> 02:38:31.450
I wrote some stuff and they were like,
well we want it to be like your stand up.

2609
02:38:31.451 --> 02:38:32.320
We want you to write.

2610
02:38:32.321 --> 02:38:36.610
Like I wrote stuff like that maxim piece where it's not like stand up.

2611
02:38:36.611 --> 02:38:38.980
It's just my thoughts on things and they were like,

2612
02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:42.610
we want it to be like a laugh every minute.
I'm like,
th th th the we'd done,

2613
02:38:42.940 --> 02:38:46.300
we're done.
So I gave them their money back.
I gave them their advanced back.

2614
02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:48.730
My friend Steve Rinella was a writer's like,
do you understand that?

2615
02:38:48.731 --> 02:38:52.510
That's like every writer's dream to give the money back and tell him to go fuck

2616
02:38:52.511 --> 02:38:56.200
off.
We'll see.
I wouldn't give them money back and tell him to go fuck off.

2617
02:38:56.590 --> 02:39:01.590
I think what I'm going to do is eventually decide to sit down and finish it and

2618
02:39:01.691 --> 02:39:05.140
just release it online.
I think that might be the best way to do it.

2619
02:39:05.141 --> 02:39:08.260
Release it as a an audio.
You're not an audio book,

2620
02:39:08.261 --> 02:39:12.010
but a pdf or release it as a book and Ebook.
Yeah,

2621
02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:14.410
or maybe find a publisher.
They're just,

2622
02:39:14.580 --> 02:39:17.250
<v 4>well,
you know what I'm doing,
I'm,
I'm a,</v>

2623
02:39:17.310 --> 02:39:19.050
and I might be getting a little ahead of myself here,

2624
02:39:19.051 --> 02:39:23.820
but I've been talking to a company called misfit.
Very cool guys.

2625
02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:28.380
Interesting story.
They're based in Fargo,
uh,
sorta like busy.
One of the,

2626
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:32.580
and the guy was,
he quit his job.
He was working on Wall Street,
um,

2627
02:39:32.790 --> 02:39:36.620
J D or I can't remember what his name is,
but he was working on Wall Street,

2628
02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:38.880
making a bunch of money late twenties,

2629
02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:43.320
get going to marry his high school sweetheart and I'm,

2630
02:39:43.370 --> 02:39:45.720
they're going to go to The Bahamas or something on their honeymoon.

2631
02:39:45.750 --> 02:39:49.020
And he goes in and he's talking to his boss and his boss says,
oh listen,

2632
02:39:49.021 --> 02:39:53.700
by the way,
I'm sorry it congratulations on the wedding this weekend,

2633
02:39:53.701 --> 02:39:56.700
but you gotta be in here Monday cause we got this from some deals coming up.

2634
02:39:57.160 --> 02:40:01.220
And he's like my honeymoon.
He's like,
man,
uh,
sorry.
You know,
you're,

2635
02:40:01.380 --> 02:40:04.520
it's Wall Street.
You're working for the big boys now.
Oh and uh,

2636
02:40:04.530 --> 02:40:06.360
we're going to give you a bonus,
you know,

2637
02:40:06.361 --> 02:40:11.361
bump up your annual salary now to two 50 instead of the Aad or whatever it was.

2638
02:40:11.851 --> 02:40:16.110
Right?
And so he goes back to his office and he's like,

2639
02:40:16.650 --> 02:40:20.220
I just got a $75,000 raise,
a,

2640
02:40:20.221 --> 02:40:24.180
I'm making a quarter of $1 million on 28 years old and I can't go to The Bahamas

2641
02:40:24.181 --> 02:40:28.950
on my honeymoon.
Fuck this.
And he says,
I got to quit.

2642
02:40:29.670 --> 02:40:31.130
And,
uh,

2643
02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:35.730
it was December 29th and if he had stayed till the end of the year,

2644
02:40:36.090 --> 02:40:39.660
he would have had it his end of year bonus,
which was like 50 grand or something.

2645
02:40:39.930 --> 02:40:43.170
But he said,
if I stay two more days,
I won't do it.
You know,

2646
02:40:43.171 --> 02:40:45.930
it's that moment you're on the edge,
you're either going to jump on or not.

2647
02:40:46.290 --> 02:40:51.000
And he went in,
he said,
sorry,
I'm out.
Quit.
Quit his job.
Right.
Ballsy dude,

2648
02:40:51.001 --> 02:40:55.740
ballsy dude.
Had no money saved because he was,
you know,
living the high life.
And,

2649
02:40:55.741 --> 02:40:59.520
uh,
I was actually in debt and he,
and so they couldn't go to The Bahamas.

2650
02:40:59.521 --> 02:41:03.060
They got married and he and his sweetheart got on the train and just went across

2651
02:41:03.061 --> 02:41:04.680
America on Amtrak.

2652
02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:09.900
And the train stopped in Fargo and he was like,
I love that movie.

2653
02:41:09.901 --> 02:41:12.060
Let's,
let's get off and check this place out.

2654
02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:17.220
And they ended up spending a few weeks there and fell in love with it.
Wow.

2655
02:41:17.250 --> 02:41:19.620
And he started going North Dakota Fargo and he said,

2656
02:41:19.621 --> 02:41:22.920
it's a really cool town and there are all these great artists there and really

2657
02:41:22.921 --> 02:41:27.180
creative people and it's this cause there's nothing for hundreds of miles.

2658
02:41:27.510 --> 02:41:31.910
So like all the interesting people like are in Fargo.
And uh,

2659
02:41:31.950 --> 02:41:33.720
he said it's his great town.
So they,

2660
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:37.780
they opened this business where they sort of do like,
um,

2661
02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:42.330
the branding for cool company.
So the only work with who they want to work with.

2662
02:41:42.810 --> 02:41:43.441
And Anyway,

2663
02:41:43.441 --> 02:41:48.441
so I'm talking to them about putting together a book of excerpts of some of the

2664
02:41:49.561 --> 02:41:52.560
best episodes of my podcast.
Ah,

2665
02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:56.100
that's a great way for people who don't listen to podcasts and for people do

2666
02:41:56.101 --> 02:41:57.900
listen to podcasts to give as a gift,
right.

2667
02:41:57.901 --> 02:42:01.560
To their dad or their with a girlfriend or whatever you,
I mean,

2668
02:42:01.561 --> 02:42:05.130
you guys could put together a fucking encyclopedia.
But anyway,
I mean like,

2669
02:42:05.131 --> 02:42:09.750
why not?
You've got all these great interviews with really interesting people,

2670
02:42:10.050 --> 02:42:13.920
you know,
why not make an Ebook or a physical book or whatever,
you know,

2671
02:42:13.921 --> 02:42:15.060
and stuff like that.
Do

2672
02:42:15.060 --> 02:42:18.750
<v 3>you have people are into reading it instead of listening to it?
I mean,
why not?</v>

2673
02:42:18.890 --> 02:42:20.850
And,
and you know,
and there's some forms,

2674
02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.670
some places where listening to it's not appropriate or not,

2675
02:42:23.710 --> 02:42:26.490
not an option on the toilet.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2676
02:42:26.610 --> 02:42:29.310
I just think there's so many different ways you get information now.

2677
02:42:29.311 --> 02:42:31.110
It's such a cool time.
Yeah.
I just,

2678
02:42:31.220 --> 02:42:36.220
I'm so between podcasting and blogging and people creating little internet

2679
02:42:37.171 --> 02:42:41.610
videos of their own and,
and these,
these youtube content people,

2680
02:42:41.611 --> 02:42:45.810
like I had this Guy Louis on yesterday from unbox therapy and he like reviews,

2681
02:42:45.811 --> 02:42:49.860
technological things on boxes them and he's very educated on them and it really

2682
02:42:49.861 --> 02:42:54.570
explains the ins and the outs and it really educates your,

2683
02:42:54.571 --> 02:42:54.960
you're,

2684
02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:58.650
you're buying options because it gives you a lot of information that's pretty

2685
02:42:58.651 --> 02:43:02.250
unique.
But these guys,
like there was no option like that before.

2686
02:43:02.251 --> 02:43:07.251
There was no like in depth consumer reports that completely uncensored without

2687
02:43:07.441 --> 02:43:12.441
commercials for 10 15 whatever minutes he chooses to upload the video completely

2688
02:43:12.941 --> 02:43:13.774
up to him.

2689
02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:16.840
The same thing as we were talking about the impact of the Internet has,

2690
02:43:16.841 --> 02:43:21.130
what an amazing thing it is because there's never been something like a podcast

2691
02:43:21.131 --> 02:43:21.890
like this.
It's going to,

2692
02:43:21.890 --> 02:43:25.060
this podcast is going to reach a million people and it's got,
I mean there's,

2693
02:43:25.061 --> 02:43:29.530
this one is going to get downloaded by a million people plus and over the course

2694
02:43:29.531 --> 02:43:30.670
of x amount of years,

2695
02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:34.420
who knows how many million it'll be because it's always up available.

2696
02:43:34.421 --> 02:43:35.380
It's always free.

2697
02:43:35.620 --> 02:43:38.650
Anybody can download it and it's available in a bunch of different forms.

2698
02:43:38.830 --> 02:43:40.990
So you can get it from youtube,
you can get it from Vimeo,

2699
02:43:40.991 --> 02:43:44.650
you can get it from Ustream,
you can get it from a stitcher,

2700
02:43:44.651 --> 02:43:45.730
you can get it from iTunes.

2701
02:43:45.731 --> 02:43:48.520
You get it as an MP three it's just available on all these different,

2702
02:43:48.700 --> 02:43:52.510
so it just keep,
and you can say whatever you want and no one's gonna stop you.

2703
02:43:52.590 --> 02:43:54.460
And that,
that never existed before.

2704
02:43:54.490 --> 02:43:56.110
There's never been something like that before.

2705
02:43:56.170 --> 02:43:59.650
That's why I hope we're not fucked.
I don't know if we're fucked,

2706
02:43:59.651 --> 02:44:03.760
but I know that this thing that we have right now is fucked like this set up,

2707
02:44:04.060 --> 02:44:04.893
you know,
the,

2708
02:44:04.980 --> 02:44:09.980
the Congress and the Senate and the fucking lobbyists and the president and the

2709
02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:13.630
diff,
you know,
corporations,
corporations.

2710
02:44:14.330 --> 02:44:17.860
The movement has been,
you think about the focus of power,
right?

2711
02:44:17.890 --> 02:44:22.630
It's been from a hunter,
gatherers dispersed,
egalitarian hunter gathers.

2712
02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:25.390
Then you got despots that came,
you know,

2713
02:44:25.391 --> 02:44:27.880
gathered the power in agricultural societies.

2714
02:44:28.180 --> 02:44:31.120
Then the despots get together and form institutions,

2715
02:44:31.510 --> 02:44:36.040
primarily the church first,
then you've got,
um,
political,
uh,

2716
02:44:36.190 --> 02:44:41.020
institutions.
Then you've got corporate,
Insta,
economic institutions.
What's next?

2717
02:44:41.050 --> 02:44:42.720
There's gotta be a next,
yeah.

2718
02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:48.240
So I'm hoping that the next will be a return to the dispersed power because of

2719
02:44:48.881 --> 02:44:53.860
what we're talking about.
Because now we've got direct connections to everyone.

2720
02:44:54.370 --> 02:44:58.510
It seems entirely possible.
And it seems,
at least if it's not the only option,

2721
02:44:58.511 --> 02:45:02.130
it will be an option.
It'll be like there'll be,
uh,

2722
02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:06.280
corporations that are set up that are more ethical and more connected to people

2723
02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:10.990
and more grounded in their approach to trying to acquire money as opposed to

2724
02:45:10.991 --> 02:45:13.720
like what we've got now.
The infinite growth paradigm,

2725
02:45:13.721 --> 02:45:17.830
which is kind of out of control.
It's just,
he can't ha,
it's not sustainable.

2726
02:45:17.831 --> 02:45:20.770
It doesn't make any sense,
but yet it's the norm.

2727
02:45:21.010 --> 02:45:26.010
Like this nonsustainable idea is the one that everybody pursues as opposed to,

2728
02:45:26.500 --> 02:45:29.830
hey,
everybody isn't $1 billion enough a year.
We're good.
Right?

2729
02:45:30.100 --> 02:45:33.810
We're good right here.
Let's just,
you know,
I mean it's,

2730
02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:38.840
it just seems like these kind of discussions and discussions like this,

2731
02:45:39.281 --> 02:45:42.970
whether it's on social media or what have you,

2732
02:45:43.030 --> 02:45:47.560
and just people's ability to Google and actually get the raw data and kind of,

2733
02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:50.490
it educates understanding and,
and,

2734
02:45:50.491 --> 02:45:55.240
and it just changes the way we view it.
Instead of viewing it as,

2735
02:45:55.730 --> 02:45:56.020
you know,

2736
02:45:56.020 --> 02:46:00.010
this is how it is and that's how you do and you don't wear a card because you

2737
02:46:00.011 --> 02:46:03.640
have to,
you do it because that's what you were born to do.

2738
02:46:03.641 --> 02:46:07.330
And then this actor smiles,
who by the way is not fucking working hard.

2739
02:46:07.510 --> 02:46:10.040
He's an actor and it doesn't even talk.
I mean,

2740
02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:14.500
<v 2>bizarre,
bizarre and ironic.
I mean,</v>

2741
02:46:14.540 --> 02:46:19.160
what an easy job when we come in and close.
Mike,
when we get right here,

2742
02:46:19.161 --> 02:46:22.130
I want you to smile,
but not a,
not a happy smile.

2743
02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:27.280
Like I'm a rugged man with the catalyst hens wearing overalls.

2744
02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:30.380
I mean,
I think we're,

2745
02:46:30.770 --> 02:46:35.150
we're seeing the bullshit better than we've ever seen it before and that's at

2746
02:46:35.151 --> 02:46:39.230
least step one.
That is my hope right there.
Look at you.

2747
02:46:39.231 --> 02:46:42.200
You becoming an optimistic coming.
It's like I have grandkids or something.

2748
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:47.480
Not that I know of.
All right.
Let's wrap it up.

2749
02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:52.190
