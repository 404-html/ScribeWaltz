00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Joe rogan podcast by night all day Weidman was pressing him,</v>

2
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 1>but Anderson was kicking him a lot in the legs and I was looking.</v>

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>like he's kicking his legs a lot.</v>

6
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>He did a lot of times,</v>

7
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>like crazy taunting,</v>

8
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

9
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Weidman did something really slick.</v>

10
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>He did something really slick.</v>

11
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

12
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>He threw a back fist,</v>

13
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>he threw a punch and then he threw a back fist because they understand what's</v>

14
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:27.900
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

15
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.680
<v Speaker 1>He was bobbing and weaving and bobbing and weaving,</v>

16
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.733
<v Speaker 1>moving away from.</v>

17
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>So he figures if the rights coming in the left's comment,</v>

18
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>so he throws a punch.</v>

19
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Mrs then throws it back fist,</v>

20
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>which makes Anderson have to go that way.</v>

21
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.851
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

22
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:42.720
<v Speaker 1>So then when he starts going that way the other way and catches him with a left</v>

23
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>hook,</v>

24
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

25
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful combination.</v>

26
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful combination with a guy,</v>

27
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>moves his head a lot because you forced them because you're not just throwing</v>

28
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>one in that direction.</v>

29
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>You throw in a second one,</v>

30
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>so he's going that way,</v>

31
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>which is like when you throw a left hook,</v>

32
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>he's going that way,</v>

33
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>so he's already going the way to avoid the left hook.</v>

34
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>He's got to come back and when it comes to when it comes back,</v>

35
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.403
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

36
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>He catches him.</v>

37
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.421
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

38
00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:05.780
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

39
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.613
<v Speaker 1>it's brilliant.</v>

40
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.071
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful Time.</v>

41
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>It's the setup before the fucking blow to it looked a little slower than</v>

42
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:13.111
<v Speaker 1>Anderson,</v>

43
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>so he was having a hard time catching them and they understand was staying on</v>

44
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>the outside and kicking his legs a lot.</v>

45
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 1>But they had collided in the first round and he took anderson down and wrapped</v>

46
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>one of his legs up and had them pretty tight.</v>

47
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like you might be getting a leg lock or attempting to leg lock and Anderson</v>

48
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>got out of it.</v>

49
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the fight to where at the,</v>

50
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.930
<v Speaker 1>after the fight where Weidman was like,</v>

51
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>make your decision now you're either on board or you're not.</v>

52
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.031
<v Speaker 1>I think there was no,</v>

53
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:36.910
<v Speaker 1>that was another fight.</v>

54
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.981
<v Speaker 1>Another fight.</v>

55
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>I think that was,</v>

57
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:40.584
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>that was after vituro sick after he beat up beat tour.</v>

59
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.301
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

60
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>pick your title.</v>

61
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:46.651
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

63
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:46.861
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

64
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:47.694
<v Speaker 1>I'm bored.</v>

65
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.421
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

66
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:49.254
<v Speaker 1>Damn Chris,</v>

67
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>you've had up to now to decide.</v>

68
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.343
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good.</v>

69
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

71
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>he's an interesting guy.</v>

72
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>He takes a loss like a fucking champ.</v>

73
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.563
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that.</v>

74
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.090
<v Speaker 1>He lost till Yoel Romero by knockout and then the was sitting on the das</v>

75
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>entering questions later with this aisle all stitched up.</v>

76
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.971
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

77
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:06.804
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

78
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.570
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

79
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 1>he's a stud.</v>

81
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.311
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

82
00:02:10.311 --> 00:02:11.520
<v Speaker 1>if I was hard to do man.</v>

83
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:11.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

84
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

85
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Kao.</v>

86
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.291
<v Speaker 1>And then just answer,</v>

87
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>answer questions with stitches over your eye and you're talking to press people.</v>

88
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some guys real fucked up at perfect composure though.</v>

89
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:21.040
<v Speaker 1>You handled it perfectly.</v>

90
00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>That was at that Gustafson,</v>

91
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones fight where they,</v>

92
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I think they both went to the hospital.</v>

93
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>It was brutal.</v>

94
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.791
<v Speaker 1>Brutal,</v>

95
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>brutal fight where it was a decision.</v>

96
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:33.031
<v Speaker 1>Fine,</v>

97
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

98
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

99
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

100
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Then it was like the,</v>

101
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.890
<v Speaker 1>like they just massacred each other,</v>

102
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>they're just beat the shit out of each other.</v>

104
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>That was a crazy fight.</v>

105
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

106
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>That was a fight where John was talking about it when he was on the podcast was</v>

107
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>talking about how much he partied after that fight for the fight.</v>

108
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.663
<v Speaker 1>Partying a lot.</v>

109
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

110
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

111
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>It was incredible fight.</v>

112
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>I just remember her bloodied.</v>

113
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:55.734
<v Speaker 1>Those guys were.</v>

114
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

115
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:57.054
<v Speaker 1>It was a rough fight.</v>

116
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Gustafson shocked.</v>

117
00:02:58.681 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people.</v>

118
00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

119
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the crowd.</v>

120
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>You could feel the crowd swell.</v>

121
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.170
<v Speaker 1>What I always call mma,</v>

122
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.270
<v Speaker 1>this is the phrase I use all the time,</v>

123
00:03:06.271 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>so maybe it'll start getting annoying too.</v>

124
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like extreme problem solving with dire physical consequences.</v>

125
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's plus shit talking.</v>

126
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.993
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

127
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Throwing that to high stakes talking shit.</v>

128
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

129
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:20.764
<v Speaker 1>High stakes.</v>

130
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>There's an emotions battle whether or not you can keep your emotions.</v>

131
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>How will you handle pressure?</v>

132
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.873
<v Speaker 1>That's giant.</v>

133
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about conor mcgregor more than anything.</v>

134
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

135
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

136
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't say more than anything.</v>

137
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>It's one of many things about them.</v>

138
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty interesting.</v>

139
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 1>One of the most interesting things about him as he handles pressure like nobody</v>

140
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:39.440
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen.</v>

141
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

142
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Like when he fought Aldo for the title,</v>

143
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even look remotely nervous.</v>

144
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>He was super relaxed,</v>

145
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:45.304
<v Speaker 1>super calm,</v>

146
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>but then you start to think though that you go,</v>

147
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.950
<v Speaker 1>how much of what you're seeing is how pressure is manifested through that guy.</v>

148
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.301
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

149
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Like for instance,</v>

150
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>the press conference kind of antics.</v>

151
00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

152
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.303
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

153
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>is that genuine?</v>

154
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Is that an act?</v>

155
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Is that how he handles the pressure of this high pressure situation by doing a</v>

156
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:09.420
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

157
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.151
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

159
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Bang show at the time.</v>

160
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.393
<v Speaker 1>So like it.</v>

161
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.840
<v Speaker 1>But I personally,</v>

162
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I find the guy,</v>

163
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.221
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

164
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:15.971
<v Speaker 1>I think what you want,</v>

165
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>why someone becomes a star,</v>

166
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Speaker 1>a endlessly entertaining on top of being good.</v>

167
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.251
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

168
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:21.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

169
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm tuning into,</v>

170
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>I want to see the fucking show.</v>

171
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 1>He's the best shit talker of all time.</v>

172
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

173
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I've said that before about other people before that I said Chael Sonnen was the</v>

174
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:32.770
<v Speaker 1>best shit talker of all time and I think he was for awhile,</v>

175
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.430
<v Speaker 1>but I think Connor Thompson and also all also as well.</v>

176
00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Connor has an additional significance to a shit-talking because he knocked</v>

177
00:04:42.321 --> 00:04:43.100
<v Speaker 1>people dead.</v>

178
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

179
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:44.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different thing.</v>

180
00:04:44.871 --> 00:04:45.090
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

181
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.360
<v Speaker 1>and not that he's not a fucking animal because Chael Sonnen is an animal and</v>

182
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

183
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.650
<v Speaker 1>he's submitted Shogun who a shell ends,</v>

184
00:04:51.651 --> 00:04:52.910
<v Speaker 1>a very solid grappler,</v>

185
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.550
<v Speaker 1>sure came very close to beating Anderson Silva in their first fight.</v>

186
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.600
<v Speaker 1>So He's a stud.</v>

187
00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.920
<v Speaker 1>But what connor does differently is the isis guys with one punch,</v>

188
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.110
<v Speaker 1>and that's a big factor in fight when you're watching him and he fights Eddie</v>

189
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Alvarez and all of a sudden he things and with the lefthand and catches them a</v>

190
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:10.070
<v Speaker 1>rock some early on you go,</v>

191
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

192
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.260
<v Speaker 1>And he realized he's fighting the guy now at 155 pounds.</v>

193
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.820
<v Speaker 1>And Eddie Alvarez a big one,</v>

194
00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:17.390
<v Speaker 1>55.</v>

195
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.200
<v Speaker 1>He's a big guy,</v>

196
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.250
<v Speaker 1>big muscular guy.</v>

197
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.380
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that he's gonna be able to wrestle connor.</v>

198
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.530
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be able to grab them and grind them out the same way you did with</v>

199
00:05:24.531 --> 00:05:25.364
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Pettis.</v>

200
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.713
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

201
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

202
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Dealing with a totally different animal.</v>

203
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Connor's just got a totally different kind of focus as far as like the way zooms</v>

204
00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:36.320
<v Speaker 1>in on targets and his precision.</v>

205
00:05:36.321 --> 00:05:37.340
<v Speaker 1>It's just speed.</v>

206
00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:40.280
<v Speaker 1>He's just dropping it in there with a 100 percent speed,</v>

207
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.140
<v Speaker 1>like that's a big part of what he's doing.</v>

208
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.830
<v Speaker 1>He's not loading up at all and the ability to stay calm when you load up,</v>

209
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.490
<v Speaker 1>say like if you see someone coming at you and you just go like,</v>

210
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.530
<v Speaker 1>all that's wasted time that's wasted time with connor has is the ability to be</v>

211
00:05:54.531 --> 00:05:56.900
<v Speaker 1>perfectly technical in a firefight.</v>

212
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.360
<v Speaker 1>So like Aldos.</v>

213
00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

214
00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 1>charging Adam.</v>

215
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 1>This is like 13 seconds into the fight.</v>

216
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.910
<v Speaker 1>All those charts and Adam and he knows how to just slide back and blam drops</v>

217
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:08.930
<v Speaker 1>that lefthanded in on it is a striking.</v>

218
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>The strongest part of his.</v>

219
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.821
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

220
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:11.481
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

221
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 1>His ground game is underrated.</v>

222
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 1>He's very good on the ground.</v>

223
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.751
<v Speaker 1>This was very good.</v>

224
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:15.584
<v Speaker 1>Defensively.</v>

225
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>He's got a good sweep sweep.</v>

226
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:17.481
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz.</v>

227
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Their first people forget that.</v>

228
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>He's the kind of guy.</v>

229
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>How much would you love to watch before he was a professional?</v>

230
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I did watch them.</v>

231
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

232
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.810
<v Speaker 1>not before the bar fights though.</v>

233
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.321
<v Speaker 1>Oh Geez.</v>

234
00:06:26.321 --> 00:06:26.661
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

235
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:29.340
<v Speaker 1>he's been in some definite scrap bars,</v>

236
00:06:29.341 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you're allowed to like get 18 in Ireland.</v>

237
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't been in a bar fight.</v>

238
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:34.574
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man,</v>

239
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 1>we're going out tonight lead when you're chatty.</v>

240
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the worst accent ever.</v>

241
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Probably right up there.</v>

242
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

243
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I saw them fight in a</v>

244
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.123
<v Speaker 1>cage warriors.</v>

245
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.220
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted to him in like 2013 before he came to the UFC.</v>

246
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:51.850
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

247
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan man.</v>

248
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Want you to come over and diddy?</v>

249
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

250
00:06:55.901 --> 00:06:56.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

251
00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 1>right after that.</v>

252
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

253
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.701
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

254
00:06:58.701 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>you have seen him.</v>

255
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Totally coincidentally.</v>

256
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I didn't cry.</v>

257
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

258
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:04.510
<v Speaker 1>I definitely probably told anybody listen to me about,</v>

259
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.050
<v Speaker 1>because I'd seen him fight before.</v>

260
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:06.261
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

261
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:06.561
<v Speaker 1>this kid.</v>

262
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Isis people.</v>

263
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

264
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 1>His lefthand,</v>

265
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 1>it's just devastating.</v>

266
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 1>And he's got a crazy style.</v>

267
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.730
<v Speaker 1>He fights.</v>

268
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 1>It was like wide stance and he moves different and he cracks guys.</v>

269
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.121
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

270
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:17.841
<v Speaker 1>this kid's legit.</v>

271
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see him in the UFC.</v>

272
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.910
<v Speaker 1>I never asked you there.</v>

273
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.503
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

274
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 1>that's January of 2013.</v>

275
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 1>So it was almost four years ago.</v>

276
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

277
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 1>did you think,</v>

278
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

279
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 1>I never talked to you about what did you think of all the,</v>

280
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:32.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

281
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 1>the talks of a him floyd mayweather fight.</v>

283
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.220
<v Speaker 1>You fight them.</v>

284
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you he would fight if you think,</v>

285
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:42.320
<v Speaker 1>what kind of match do you think that he's a lot bigger than floyd?</v>

286
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

287
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.261
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

288
00:07:43.261 --> 00:07:46.820
<v Speaker 1>let's just emphasize that he's a lot bigger,</v>

289
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.220
<v Speaker 1>so it'd be a real problem as far as like weight cutting because if they went,</v>

290
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 1>layla conor fight it wherever he wants.</v>

291
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Connor's is going away somewhere around 170 pounds.</v>

292
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

293
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 1>That's where he's at his best.</v>

294
00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Like in his optimum with no weight cutting.</v>

295
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

296
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Floyd's that big.</v>

297
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.043
<v Speaker 1>I think floyd,</v>

298
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.680
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you he's probably not more than one 60.</v>

299
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Floyd's bigger than 1:16.</v>

300
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.493
<v Speaker 1>Real life.</v>

301
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Small Dude.</v>

302
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.663
<v Speaker 1>He's a small guy.</v>

303
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.250
<v Speaker 1>He's really nice.</v>

304
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Short doesn't mean wait,</v>

305
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:16.154
<v Speaker 1>but he's small.</v>

306
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.960
<v Speaker 1>What weight did he begin his career at?</v>

307
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.833
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather.</v>

308
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

309
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge floyd mayweather fan and I think that when it comes to boxing,</v>

310
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.090
<v Speaker 1>I think he's one of the most skillful boxers that's ever lived.</v>

311
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I really do technical,</v>

312
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:30.770
<v Speaker 1>if not the most 1:50.</v>

313
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.731
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

314
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:33.320
<v Speaker 1>that's probably what he lasts.</v>

315
00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Fought at like didn't he make 'em when he met,</v>

316
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.170
<v Speaker 1>when he fought Canelo didn't you make him come down a bit and made them come</v>

317
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 1>down to like 1:54 or something like that?</v>

318
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:41.893
<v Speaker 1>It sounds right.</v>

319
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

320
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I thought they had some sort of a catch weight fight.</v>

321
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.533
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>

322
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And Canelo's fight.</v>

323
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's fighting at one 60 now.</v>

324
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.690
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely bigger.</v>

325
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Or was he fighting at 1:54?</v>

326
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Kinetica Lufkin is one 60,</v>

327
00:08:56.341 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

328
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Is that the.</v>

329
00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Hold up is the two of them because I think I feel like Canelo has been fighting</v>

330
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:01.801
<v Speaker 1>middle way too.</v>

331
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Like he fought Kodo.</v>

332
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:03.211
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>

333
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:04.044
<v Speaker 1>That</v>

334
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 1>wasn't that at middleweight or 1:54?</v>

335
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.513
<v Speaker 1>Alvarez.</v>

336
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Alvarez catch weight 1:50 1:52.</v>

337
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.953
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

338
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:13.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

339
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 1>So he made canelo loose some weight.</v>

340
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:15.840
<v Speaker 1>He just.</v>

341
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Canal is a lot bigger than him.</v>

342
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

343
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:22.140
<v Speaker 1>So canal probably walks around maybe 20 pounds heavier than that.</v>

344
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad motherfucker too.</v>

345
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.080
<v Speaker 1>He's good.</v>

346
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

347
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.120
<v Speaker 1>And me that just boxed him up yet.</v>

348
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.570
<v Speaker 1>What I'm hearing plot all look at that.</v>

349
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Just beautiful technique that's wonder,</v>

350
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

351
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.221
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>

352
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:35.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

353
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

354
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 1>is like connor's skills,</v>

355
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 1>just technical skills match up to somebody like the counter counter defense.</v>

356
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine they would unless they were there.</v>

357
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:47.820
<v Speaker 1>So out of shape.</v>

358
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

359
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Him,</v>

360
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying on top of his game,</v>

361
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:52.620
<v Speaker 1>him on top of his game,</v>

362
00:09:52.621 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to hit him.</v>

363
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:54.880
<v Speaker 1>He's going to know.</v>

364
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to be really top level to catch him.</v>

365
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.400
<v Speaker 1>It's so nuts at that dude is so fast that he,</v>

366
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.150
<v Speaker 1>he box it like nobody's,</v>

367
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

368
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.380
<v Speaker 1>with his lead hand down.</v>

369
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Not even hip level.</v>

370
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Mid Thigh sometimes.</v>

371
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Well it's because that forces his shoulder over.</v>

372
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 1>It's actually an easier way to block a lot of things.</v>

373
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:18.720
<v Speaker 1>If you're skillful with it.</v>

374
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:19.723
<v Speaker 1>You got shoulder.</v>

375
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Heck yeah.</v>

376
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:21.560
<v Speaker 1>You got to be.</v>

377
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.560
<v Speaker 1>It's not just quick.</v>

378
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:23.550
<v Speaker 1>And he's definitely quick.</v>

379
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>It's very quick.</v>

380
00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:26.670
<v Speaker 1>But what floyd has over,</v>

381
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.620
<v Speaker 1>like almost anyone else,</v>

382
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 1>he said he's got this incredible knowledge of what you're going to do before you</v>

383
00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:32.940
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

384
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Like he knows so much about boxing,</v>

385
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.460
<v Speaker 1>about boxing as a science from his brother or his father rather.</v>

386
00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:39.294
<v Speaker 1>And his uncle,</v>

387
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.530
<v Speaker 1>his uncle's Roger May,</v>

388
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:45.300
<v Speaker 1>whether it was a black Mamba who an all time fucking exciting guy to watch.</v>

389
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:46.590
<v Speaker 1>And like the eighties and nineties,</v>

390
00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:47.910
<v Speaker 1>he would starched people,</v>

391
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

392
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.040
<v Speaker 1>dude him on those hbo shows.</v>

393
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.120
<v Speaker 2>They've never had a better comedy than Roger May.</v>

394
00:10:53.121 --> 00:10:53.954
<v Speaker 2>Whether moments.</v>

395
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.090
<v Speaker 2>It's the greatest.</v>

396
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:55.271
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

397
00:10:55.271 --> 00:10:56.560
<v Speaker 2>you mean in between corners?</v>

398
00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

399
00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.650
<v Speaker 2>when they used to do the 24 slash seven,</v>

400
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.060
<v Speaker 2>24 slash seven,</v>

401
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.440
<v Speaker 2>he would fucking massacre lowe's.</v>

402
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.600
<v Speaker 2>The funniest shit I've ever seen.</v>

403
00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:08.690
<v Speaker 2>And they edited him.</v>

404
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.480
<v Speaker 2>So fucking funny.</v>

405
00:11:10.481 --> 00:11:11.920
<v Speaker 2>One of those fights there were fighting,</v>

406
00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:13.600
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was Alvarez or somebody.</v>

407
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.890
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

408
00:11:14.891 --> 00:11:17.410
<v Speaker 2>we got to prepare for Florida and watch his fights.</v>

409
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:18.663
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

410
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.320
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just,</v>

411
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.420
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm just going to have the fight in my life on my hands.</v>

412
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.330
<v Speaker 2>And then they cut to Roy or to,</v>

413
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.410
<v Speaker 2>to Roger Mayweather.</v>

414
00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.110
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

415
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.520
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is Albert is</v>

416
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.943
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

417
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.470
<v Speaker 2>he was pretending he doesn't even know who the guy</v>

418
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:35.310
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

419
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.530
<v Speaker 2>You know that that was a big part of the preparation for.</v>

420
00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:39.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it in the end it was,</v>

421
00:11:39.791 --> 00:11:41.950
<v Speaker 2>but for a long time when they would go like,</v>

422
00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.390
<v Speaker 2>how are you preparing for this fighter?</v>

423
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:44.200
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

424
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.760
<v Speaker 2>his answer and they're legit answer was like they have to prepare for this shit.</v>

425
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.250
<v Speaker 2>We're not preparing for anything.</v>

426
00:11:51.251 --> 00:11:52.910
<v Speaker 2>He better prepare a lot you.</v>

427
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 2>And that's how they would approach</v>

428
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.251
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

429
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:54.401
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

430
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:55.480
<v Speaker 1>we're not studying you.</v>

431
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.480
<v Speaker 1>You need to study this shit right now because it's going to be bad.</v>

432
00:11:58.481 --> 00:11:59.314
<v Speaker 1>What happens to you?</v>

433
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.370
<v Speaker 1>That was points.</v>

434
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

435
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.863
<v Speaker 1>it's a good point.</v>

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:23.981
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>

00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:24.814
<v Speaker 1>it's entertaining,</v>

497
00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.300
<v Speaker 1>but it is like one note he used to hold like bricks and money up to his ear</v>

509
00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:49.264
<v Speaker 1>of his fights.</v>

513
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.033
<v Speaker 1>There's a sense.</v>

514
00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Look at it as he goes.</v>

515

521
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.730

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Y'All chartered jets and we own jets.</v>

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.330
<v Speaker 1>The money team.</v>

546
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.163
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

547
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

548
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.023
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

549
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.863
<v Speaker 1>I think he's rich.</v>

550
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.490
<v Speaker 1>I think he definitely has money,</v>

551
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 1>so he's made a lot of fucking money,</v>

552
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 1>that's for damn sure.</v>

553
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.270
<v Speaker 1>He's excellent at what he does for sure.</v>

554
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.133
<v Speaker 1>Across the board.</v>

555
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

556
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no doubt about it,</v>

557
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.253
<v Speaker 1>but he's also.</v>

558
00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.610
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>

559
00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:14.150
<v Speaker 1>he's 49 and 49 slash 11 and he's the only guy.</v>

560
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 1>He said he hasn't broken rocky Marciano's record yet.</v>

561
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:17.893
<v Speaker 1>He's tied it,</v>

562
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.370
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting.</v>

563
00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Like I wonder if that's on purpose.</v>

564
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he doesn't want to break it.</v>

565
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:23.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

566
00:15:23.211 --> 00:15:27.170
<v Speaker 1>I think as well people talking shit about the pressure of a of a,</v>

567
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:30.140
<v Speaker 1>of it going away is the thing that happens.</v>

568
00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Like as the older you get,</v>

569
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:31.420
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:31.911
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

571
00:15:31.911 --> 00:15:32.300
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

572
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.570
<v Speaker 1>this is a good boxing retirement age for him and it's like,</v>

573
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.680
<v Speaker 1>do you want to do 50?</v>

574
00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:37.131
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

575
00:15:37.131 --> 00:15:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Well it's got to be a meaningful 50.</v>

576
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 1>You can't some scrub for 50.</v>
