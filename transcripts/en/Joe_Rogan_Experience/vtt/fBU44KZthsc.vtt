00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I always think I'm almost through this,</v>

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>so imagine we're the only civilization in the galaxy.</v>

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.480
<v Speaker 1>What a tremendous responsibility there is on us.</v>

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Imagine what that knowledge should do to our political processes,</v>

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 1>the way that we think about ourselves,</v>

7
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>the way that we get on together.</v>

8
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how ridiculous it is to divide our little world up into countries and</v>

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.790
<v Speaker 1>another little war every now and again,</v>

10
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>important nuclear missiles at each other,</v>

11
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>if in fact there's nowhere else in the Milky Way galaxy where anybody thinks</v>

12
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 1>where anybody can look at the styles and think about and have these</v>

13
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:36.804
<v Speaker 1>conversations,</v>

14
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>what a ridiculous way to behave.</v>

15
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

16
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.300
<v Speaker 1>So I think the cosmology is gives a perspective which not doesn't necessarily</v>

17
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>need to be humbling.</v>

18
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 1>It is humbling and that's perhaps a good thing,</v>

19
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.071
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't need.</v>

20
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to be depressed about it.</v>

21
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>It could be quite elating.</v>

22
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.881
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

23
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:54.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:58.610
<v Speaker 1>with what we are according to the evidence and the data at the moment is almost</v>

25
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 1>indescribably special.</v>

26
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>

27
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>our tininess,</v>

28
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>our potential uniqueness,</v>

29
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:10.041
<v Speaker 1>our insignificance in a cosmic scale actually makes us special because we're the</v>

30
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:12.030
<v Speaker 1>only place.</v>

31
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.361
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

32
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>so these,</v>

33
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>these ideas are worth pursuing,</v>

34
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I think because they,</v>

35
00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

36
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 1>they make you think about these issues.</v>

37
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

38
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>It also point to our ego that we think that our biological processes any more</v>

39
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>important than the exploding sons that are required to create carbon life in the</v>

40
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:28.690
<v Speaker 1>first place or,</v>

41
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.110
<v Speaker 1>or any of the processes of the universe.</v>

42
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>The answer that I think is that you're right,</v>

43
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.530
<v Speaker 1>that in,</v>

44
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.363
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

45
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

46
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>in a completely logical sense,</v>

47
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>we're no more important or less important than the stars themselves.</v>

48
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.821
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>

49
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>which is natural objects.</v>

50
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 1>But I would counter by saying that people look for meaning in the universe.</v>

51
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>People like to look for meaning.</v>

52
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>It's this one thing that we've done since we began to look at the stars.</v>

53
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.770
<v Speaker 1>The universe means something to me.</v>

54
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.131
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

55
00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

56
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.791
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

57
00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Meaning exists because it means something to us.</v>

58
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>So we know that it would be ridiculous to say the university is meaningless.</v>

59
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>It means something in my relatives,</v>

60
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.131
<v Speaker 1>our families,</v>

61
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:05.731
<v Speaker 1>we have loved ones,</v>

62
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:06.564
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

63
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that that meaning might be emergent,</v>

64
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>it might appear from the laws of nature.</v>

65
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>And it is almost certainly transient,</v>

66
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>unless we build these self replicating machines,</v>

67
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:17.001
<v Speaker 1>we will.</v>

68
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to last forever as a civilization probably so that to me,</v>

69
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't in any way water down the significance of it.</v>

70
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.751
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

71
00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>I think again,</v>

72
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>cosmology can be,</v>

73
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.980
<v Speaker 1>can be a powerful aid to philosophical thoughts in this sense because we have to</v>

74
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>accept that there's meaning in the universe because it means something to us.</v>

75
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't see why it has to be eternal.</v>

76
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't see why that meaning doesn't imply purpose.</v>

77
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any purpose to the universe,</v>

78
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>brings any point to our existence,</v>

79
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that we exist at all is worth celebrating.</v>

80
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to add anything else.</v>

81
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.261
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

82
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:53.150
<v Speaker 1>you almost did it to me.</v>

83
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>You devalue it.</v>

84
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:54.894
<v Speaker 1>So why would you?</v>

85
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>This is remarkable.</v>

86
00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>We emerged a single celled organisms before that will emerge in some chemical</v>

87
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>reactions in,</v>

88
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>in hydrothermal vents,</v>

89
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>probably down in the deep primordial oceans of ancient earth.</v>

90
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>And over three point 8 billion years,</v>

91
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>we've come to the point where we can sit and think about the styles and have</v>

92
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>conversations like this.</v>

93
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that not enough?</v>

94
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Can we just leave it there?</v>

95
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have to be a point?</v>

96
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>There isn't a point.</v>

97
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's appalling to that,</v>

98
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth celebrating because you don't think about it.</v>

99
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.651
<v Speaker 1>It's out of sight,</v>

100
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:27.191
<v Speaker 1>out of mind.</v>

101
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to look at it.</v>

102
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.230
<v Speaker 1>It's when you look at it and you know,</v>

103
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>kind of like if you had to take a shit,</v>

104
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing you're like,</v>

106
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:34.211
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

107
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to take a shit.</v>

108
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And he'd get on that toilet comes up.</v>

109
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:41.340
<v Speaker 1>But if you had a stuff that shit back in your asshole theater,</v>

110
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>reach in there with rubber gloves on and just pack your own ass,</v>

111
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>repack it.</v>

112
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>That might be one of the worst things you could ever do.</v>

113
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Like taking a shit is amazing</v>

114
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 1>when you hold it in for just a little bit,</v>

115
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>not a long time.</v>

116
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>He'll lecture extra 20 minutes and then you'd get on that toilet just,</v>

117
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

118
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:04.650
<v Speaker 1>you feel those logs just fucking barrel and down the river.</v>

119
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.931
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

120
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

121
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.730
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

122
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.500
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

123
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.281
<v Speaker 2>I went to,</v>

124
00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:09.560
<v Speaker 2>I had took a dump at the mall the other day.</v>

125
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.830
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to eat healthier,</v>

126
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.270
<v Speaker 2>eating more Greens and stuff,</v>

127
00:04:14.271 --> 00:04:16.250
<v Speaker 2>so it came out like very earthy.</v>

128
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

129
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:18.560
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't anything horrible.</v>

130
00:04:18.561 --> 00:04:23.270
<v Speaker 2>It just smelled and I flushed and then the guy came in to clean the restroom and</v>

131
00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:28.271
<v Speaker 2>started choking and I felt so good and he just hear him like trying to clean up</v>

132
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.340
<v Speaker 2>and then he just go at the end.</v>

133
00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:32.030
<v Speaker 2>He just goes,</v>

134
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.140
<v Speaker 2>he was in there about two minutes.</v>

135
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.800
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

136
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.390
<v Speaker 2>it smells like fucking shit.</v>

137
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Like oh yeah.</v>

138
00:04:40.281 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

139
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.200
<v Speaker 2>it was like a highlight of my life.</v>

140
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

141
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Like you scored on him.</v>

142
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>He scored on them fucking shit in a bathroom.</v>

143
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>That guy's got to go in there right after you.</v>

144
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 1>And I had flushed.</v>

145
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.510
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't like it was still sitting there stewing like it was post flush.</v>

146
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Well there's nothing worse than when you have to shit really bad.</v>

147
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 1>And the only option is a Porta potty and you're at a concert and there's 20</v>

148
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:09.230
<v Speaker 1>people behind you and there's a long ass line and you go in there and you plop</v>

149
00:05:09.231 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 1>down and you're shitting on other people's shit that is on top of other people's</v>

150
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

151
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 1>which is on other people's Shit,</v>

152
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 1>which is all in smurf juice.</v>

153
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.860
<v Speaker 1>And you just drop dropping logs on top of preexisting logs and just gagging.</v>

154
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile the band's playing your favorite song.</v>

155
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Freebird No.</v>

156
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.823
<v Speaker 1>Fuck</v>

157
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.030
<v Speaker 2>did you.</v>

158
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I saw this online.</v>

159
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 2>They had a thing about the Porta potties,</v>

160
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.710
<v Speaker 2>like the whole point of him is you're supposed to close the lid and then that</v>

161
00:05:39.711 --> 00:05:42.770
<v Speaker 2>will take the scent out up through this funnel,</v>

162
00:05:42.771 --> 00:05:45.170
<v Speaker 2>like this tube and release sent up there.</v>

163
00:05:45.171 --> 00:05:48.590
<v Speaker 2>But the reason Porta potty smells so bad is because everyone just leaves the lit</v>

164
00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:48.770
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

165
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:49.640
<v Speaker 2>No one wants to touch it.</v>

166
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.541
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

167
00:05:50.541 --> 00:05:51.374
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

168
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Dylan bullshit.</v>

169
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.603
<v Speaker 1>It stinks.</v>

170
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking confined space.</v>

171
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:56.370
<v Speaker 1>You're shitting in a phone booth.</v>

172
00:05:56.371 --> 00:05:57.204
<v Speaker 1>It's not going.</v>

173
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>That's smells everywhere.</v>

174
00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Think as a society.</v>

175
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>We could try it.</v>

176
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 1>If it's still going to snake,</v>

177
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>we can at least give it a shot.</v>

178
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.221
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

179
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:05.060
<v Speaker 1>I wish they movies.</v>

180
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Movies are like kids.</v>

181
00:06:06.421 --> 00:06:06.621
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

182
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:06.921
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>

183
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:07.754
<v Speaker 1>do you have a favorite?</v>

184
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

185
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:09.620
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to tell you.</v>

186
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.041
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

187
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:10.500
<v Speaker 1>like that's,</v>

188
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.670
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing with kids.</v>

189
00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like every parent,</v>

190
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit what they say.</v>

191
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 1>I love them all equally.</v>

192
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>No you don't because some kids are just assholes.</v>

193
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 1>You can't possibly,</v>

194
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.370
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

196
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 1>and some of them are screw ups in life life children.</v>

197
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.011
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

198
00:06:23.011 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

199
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

200
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.590
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of love them all equally because I think when kids feel like</v>

201
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 1>there's a part of it that's your fault,</v>

202
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that people feel guilty.</v>

203
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 1>You're saying guilt compensates for the lighter,</v>

204
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.650
<v Speaker 1>raises the love because you feel that they need more love because you screwed</v>

205
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:41.961
<v Speaker 1>them up.</v>

206
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 1>You're responsible for there being a dog that killed one of my other dogs.</v>

207
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.860
<v Speaker 1>I love the dog that she killed,</v>

208
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.730
<v Speaker 3>but I loved her just as much and it was very sad.</v>

209
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:52.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

210
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.980
<v Speaker 3>obviously I have loved the dog that got killed more because she wasn't a cunt,</v>

211
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.130
<v Speaker 3>she wasn't an asshole that was out there killing the other dogs,</v>

212
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.870
<v Speaker 3>but this dog was a sweetie and I picked her up at the pound and she lived at</v>

213
00:07:03.871 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

214
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.700
<v Speaker 3>she was in one of those no kill shelters for like eight months.</v>

215
00:07:06.701 --> 00:07:08.230
<v Speaker 3>And when I was young,</v>

216
00:07:08.231 --> 00:07:10.360
<v Speaker 3>man I had a real problem in that.</v>

217
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.330
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to talk about I guess</v>

218
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.230
<v Speaker 3>where I felt like,</v>

219
00:07:17.231 --> 00:07:17.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

220
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.570
<v Speaker 3>I felt I had always had this,</v>

221
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:20.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

222
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.080
<v Speaker 3>this need to help strays and I think I had this need to help strays because I</v>

223
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:28.190
<v Speaker 3>felt like a stray and when I would see a,</v>

224
00:07:28.191 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 3>a dog in a pound or a click,</v>

225
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.610
<v Speaker 3>I bought a cat from a fucking pet store because it hissed at me,</v>

226
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

227
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.950
<v Speaker 3>because I felt his poor fucking cat,</v>

228
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 3>like scared of me.</v>

229
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:37.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm not scared of me.</v>

230
00:07:37.841 --> 00:07:38.674
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>

231
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.460
<v Speaker 3>And I felt that way about this dog,</v>

232
00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:43.020
<v Speaker 3>this poor dog.</v>

233
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.690
<v Speaker 3>I used to call her squeaky because when I picked her up she couldn't even talk.</v>

234
00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:49.150
<v Speaker 3>She couldn't bark because she barked so much,</v>

235
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:51.490
<v Speaker 3>so often in this pound that her voice was gone.</v>

236
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.350
<v Speaker 3>So when she was barking in the pound,</v>

237
00:07:53.351 --> 00:07:53.651
<v Speaker 3>she'd be like,</v>

238
00:07:53.651 --> 00:07:54.484
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

239
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.520
<v Speaker 1>it was like this squeak.</v>

240
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:57.921
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

241
00:07:57.921 --> 00:07:59.180
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is wrong with her voice?</v>

242
00:07:59.181 --> 00:07:59.660
<v Speaker 3>And I realized,</v>

243
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.141
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

244
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:03.140
<v Speaker 3>she's barking all day and she doesn't have a voice anymore.</v>

245
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 3>And then when I took her home and took care of her,</v>

246
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:09.230
<v Speaker 3>she eventually got her voice back and she barked like a normal dog.</v>

247
00:08:09.231 --> 00:08:11.930
<v Speaker 3>But that dog fucking loved people.</v>

248
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.070
<v Speaker 3>She loved people.</v>

249
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:14.680
<v Speaker 3>She was so happy to be out of that shit,</v>

250
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.300
<v Speaker 3>but she didn't like other dogs because the dogs came near her.</v>

251
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 3>She felt like it was a competition for love.</v>

252
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 3>Like if you came near another dog,</v>

253
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.780
<v Speaker 3>that other dog was going to get that love.</v>

254
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 3>So she would get upset at that dog for stealing love from her and she would try</v>

255
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:28.244
<v Speaker 3>to attack it.</v>

256
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.150
<v Speaker 3>So I loved her too.</v>

257
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:29.631
<v Speaker 3>Equally,</v>

258
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 3>even though she was an idiot,</v>

259
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

260
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.040
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

261
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't her fault that she was an idiot.</v>

262
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

263
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

264
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:34.990
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

265
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

266
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.420
<v Speaker 3>I realized from then on I will never get a dog that's not a puppy,</v>

267
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 3>that you got to raise them from the time they're puppies because then you don't</v>

268
00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:42.920
<v Speaker 3>have any,</v>

269
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.080
<v Speaker 3>they don't have any phobias or weirdness.</v>

270
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.600
<v Speaker 3>You get a chance to,</v>

271
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.380
<v Speaker 3>to raise them around people and raise them around other dogs and socialize them.</v>

272
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 3>And it's an important aspect of humans just like it's an important aspect.</v>

273
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.820
<v Speaker 3>Any other animal that's in our culture.</v>

274
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.661
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

275
00:08:57.661 --> 00:08:58.494
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

276
00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

277
00:08:59.250 --> 00:08:59.401
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

278
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:03.410
<v Speaker 3>you can love your fucking shitty kids just as much as you love your good kids</v>

279
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.250
<v Speaker 3>because it's partly your fault that they're shitty.</v>
