00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.590
What's up everybody?
Hey,
welcome to the podcast.

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.640
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by nature
box.

3
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.271
Now,

4
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:17.271
this is the first time we're ever opening up this nature box in the office is a

5
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.960
tremendous apple freaks.
My kid loves him,
which was your favorite here.

6
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.880
What naturebox is,
if you don't know,
uh,

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.500
it's a healthy snacks they shipped to you.
There's a third option,

8
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.070
snack smarter in 2014 with nature box.
Um,

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.800
the idea is when 3:00 PM hunger pangs hit,

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.150
you can tough it out and get cranky and lightheaded or you can hit the vending

11
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:41.040
machine and pack on the pounds.

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.740
The idea is that they're bringing you the option of healthy snacks delivered to

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.090
French toast,
Granola,
salted Carmel,
Pretzel pops,

14
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.220
dark cocoa almonds and more nutritionalist approved.

15
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.760
Nutritionalist approved your fat.
Fucking you want to lose weight.
Yeah.

16
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.040
Zero Trans fats,
zero folk doors,

17
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.860
no high fructose corn syrup and nothing artificial.

18
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.260
Very delicious nature ships for free.

I love the,
uh,
the Lonestar snacks as good to apple fig.

24
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.020
Uh,
the Apple Pie.
Fig Bob,
my daughter loves them.
The best things they have.

25
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:34.410
Have those rights.
The sesame sticks,
a rice sticks to black and white.

26
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:38.070
Granolas delicious.
The uh,
the uh,

27
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.230
they have something else that's out of this world.

28
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.740
I mean they have some great stuff.
It's healthy.
It has a sealer patch.

29
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:46.530
You could close them right back up and eat in the morning.
You know,

30
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:50.100
they have just great stuff,
man.
I'm eating harvest rice.
They're not bad.

31
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.600
They're not bad at all.
It's actually delicious.
No,
I know.
But the cocoa almonds,

32
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:56.430
we'll put you over the fucking top.

33
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.590
That cocoa almonds does it late night with law and order type thing.

34
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.180
It's really cool cause they have like the options,

35
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.010
like if you're Vegan or if you might lactose free sway free.

36
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:07.650
You choose what you want and it shows you what their options and then mail them

37
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:10.950

44
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.780
They have over a hundred thousand copies.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.170
They have everything you could ever want to download and listen to whether it's

46
00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:47.640
educational fiction,
nonfiction,
comedy podcast,
stand up.

47
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.400
They have just audio entertainment,

48
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.440
entertainment that you would use if you were on a plane or if you were in

49
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.870
traffic and it,
I've said it time and time again,

50
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:02.560
but so many people don't utilize this as a way to just be entertained.

51
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.310
Like you won't mind being in your car stuck in traffic.

52
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.770
If you're listening to a really good audio book,

53
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.580
I've sat in my car for like an extra minute because I wanted to like a chapter

54
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:15.070
to be over.
It's pretty fucking bad ass.

55
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.130
It really does transform the experience of commuting and it's a way to stimulate

56
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:24.040
your mind while you're in the middle of doing something else.
Jim Norton,

57
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.610
happy endings taste the tales of a meaty breasted.
Zilch.

58
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.380
He reads it himself,
so it's gotta be awesome.

It's an outstanding resource for audio entertainment and they are a sponsor of

62
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:48.100
the podcast.
We're also sponsored by Ting.

63
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.530
That's the last one you have to do to a ting is uh,
first of all,

64
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:55.690
just see the thing about tink slashing their prices.

65
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.270
<v 1>Yeah.
Who does that?
Who,
who may,</v>

66
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.390
who gives you guys who ever takes money off of the bill?
That's ridiculous.

67
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:02.980
They cut their data plan.

68
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.640
<v 0>Yeah.
Ridiculously.
They cut it in half.
They cut their data plan.</v>

69
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.970
They're fucking nuts,
man.
I don't know what they're doing.

70
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.100
They slashed their data prices on the two year anniversary and they did it

71
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:14.260
permanently,
which I don't know how you do.
How do,

72
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.460
how can you say you do a permanently cause like imagine if you're,

73
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:20.760
like you said you were selling TVs and you were like,
uh,

74
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.550
Brian's TV service is going to sell TVs for $100 permanently.

75
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:25.630
We're going to slash prices.

76
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.530
You can't say permanently cause a thousand years from now TV's going to be

77
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:32.410
expensive as fuck.
And you'd be like,
what about that permanent shit son?

78
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.100
You don't have to start your own new business because you fucked yourself with

79
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:38.960
your whole,
all that permanent nonsense.
Uh,

80
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.430
that said whatever they're doing it,
I don't know how they're doing it.

81
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.570
It says on the two year anniversary of its launch,
shockingly likable,

82
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:48.190
mobile phone service,
Ting,

83
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.140
a division of two cows incorporated surprise its customers with a big drop in

84
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:57.820
data pricing and then a beautiful definition or description,
shockingly likable,

85
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:02.310
mobile phone service.
That's a really good way to describe it.
Um,
we've been,
uh,

86
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.580
sponsored by Ting for a long time now and everybody that goes to tank saves

87
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:07.414
money.

88
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.900
All the people that I've sent over there with Chris Ryan or any of the other

89
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:15.901
friends that we've sent over to ting ting is a mean.

90
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.480
They've saved them.
I think they said that as many as 98%.

91
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:20.710
That's what it says on their website.
Right?

92
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.910
<v 1>It's crazy.
Like they're,
they,
they even knocked the per megabyte.</v>

93
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:26.590
When you go over your plan,
uh,

94
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.610
buy for $2 and 25 cents to $1 and 50 cents.

95
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.090
<v 0>Um,
having no contract I think is a good thing too.
There's a,</v>

96
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.290
there's a way that you can,
um,
there's a way that you can do it.

97
00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:41.450
Like I think on the other providers,
you have to buy a phone.

98
00:05:41.451 --> 00:05:44.840
It is possible on Psalm to have no contracts and they're starting to open that

99
00:05:44.841 --> 00:05:49.700
up.
Now.
Uh,
I think that's a,
that's something that people are sort of a demanding.

100
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.590
And as the mobile phone companies become more and more competitive,

101
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.410
I think that,
uh,
they're going,
uh,

102
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.630
probably embrace that as an option in the future.

103
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.460
[inaudible] has been doing that all along.

104
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.660
Ting has it set up so that they sell the top end android devices.

105
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.620
And what they do is they buy time on the sprint network and uh,

106
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.310
you can use a sprint network just like someone who uses sprint does.

107
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:15.380
So if any place where you get service with sprint,

108
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:20.300
you would get service with Ting and just stupid cheap data prices and dope

109
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:24.050
phones.
I don't like saying dope cause I'm almost 50,
but dope.

110
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.370
Um,
they just have the coolest android phones,
which I've switched over to.

111
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.040
I use an android phone now.
So,
uh,

112
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.050
rogan.ting.com go there and save 25 bucks at any of their new devices.

113
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.340
Check it out,
enjoy it and uh,
and check into all the different phones they have.

114
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:43.430
The HTC one is another pretty dope android phone.

115
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:46.880
If you're a person that's been like an iPhone person your whole life and you're

116
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:50.780
like,
man,
I just fucking,
I don't know if I could make this jump.

117
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.330
You can make the jump.
Trust me.
I did it.
It's easy.

118
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.210
Then the android phones are pretty commensurate now.
They're pretty bad ass.

119
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.470
Notice how you use the word commensurate as if I use it all the time anyway.

120
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.210
rogan.ting.com why Fako round mad flavor

121
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.580

124
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.070

Boom.
Dropping it on your head.
I shouldn't say bitches.

125
00:07:20.071 --> 00:07:22.220
When you deal with the company,
it's unprofessional.
Joe Diaz.

126
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.080
Enough with the commercials on it.
Dot Com.

127
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.000
Use a codeword Rogan and save 10% off any and all supplements.

129

Just totally fucked up.
What happened?
I don't know what happened here.
This is

130
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.813

<v 0>Hey,
here we are back in the house again.</v>

134
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.150
Showed Dheas the new blue cigarettes spokesperson.

135
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:06.010
Stephen Dorff is out and you're in and Jenny Mccarthy could suck my dick.
No,
no,

136
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.120
no.
Just keep her,
keep her,
keep her eyes.
She's so pretty.

137
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:10.130
I just like to look at her.
She is getting prettier.

138
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.350
She really is beautiful that that check.
And as she's gotten older,
I mean,

139
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.981
you know,

140
00:08:15.981 --> 00:08:19.520
everybody gets mad at her and they're down on her for what they called the

141
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.920
pseudo science about a vaccination.

142
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.620
She's like a real strong opponent of vaccinations and you know,

143
00:08:27.621 --> 00:08:30.260
a lot of people felt like she had no business doing that.

144
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:34.450
She didn't understand the science behind it.
She didn't understand like,
you know,

145
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.670
how many people are saved by vaccinations and how dangerous it is.

146
00:08:37.671 --> 00:08:40.520
So to this day I see people taking free shots at her,

147
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:45.140
but you know,
all that aside,
you know,

148
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.160
misguided,
non scientific approach to vaccines on the side.

149
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.990
See her personality is great.
She's great,
she's sweet.
Even have autism no more.

150
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.980
No.
Well now some I

151
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.340
<v 4>don't,
you know,
I don't know what he had,
what,
how he was diagnosed.</v>

152
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:00.900
I don't understand autism.

153
00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.920
They don't understand that she was pissed about Jim Carrey.

154
00:09:02.921 --> 00:09:04.610
We don't call it a kid no more.
You're not sucking his dick.

155
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.250
And if you're not looking at this,
nothing,
no more.
Wasn't going to call the kid.

156
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.520
You'd have to call the kid.
Well,
you don't have to.

157
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.740
Why you were talking about you got different relationships and you move on.

158
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:15.870
You know,
what are you going to do?
And it's why it's a,

159
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:18.630
if maybe if he called the kid,
then Jenny get on the phone and say,
Jim,

160
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:21.300
when can I suck your Dick Again?
And he would avoid it.
You don't know.

161
00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:25.620
You don't know what's going on.
But the kids still like,
what do we give a shit?

162
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:30.270
What are we TMZ over here?
I just,
she's nice.
She's pretty.
She's got a child.

163
00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:32.340
She's beautiful.
She's beautiful.
She's got banging.

164
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:35.950
Tetsy what's baby good to see everybody.
Red Band in the house.
My main man.

165
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.660
What is that photo that you put up?
Oh,
it's a picture of her new show.

166
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:43.760
Jennifer kept McCarthy's new show and Tiffany Haddish in it also.
So Bell.

167
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.690
That's Paula Bell.
All right,
Paul.

168
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.200
Paul bells fucking whole sequence or something dirty.
And what do they do?

169
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:57.090
They do something at night?
Um,
Shit.
I don't know what that is.
It red band.

170
00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.590
I got a call her dirty,
sexy,
funny.
It's a TV show.

171
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.820
It's a view panel list kind of thing.
I guess Paul A.

172
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.340
Bell is a fucking hilarious comments.
She's a monster.
She sees the lane.

173
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.800
She's at that point where she's,

174
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.090
she gets on the stage and she just fucking kills him.
She's become a guide.

175
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.480
That's why.
Yeah,
she's got the mentality like a guy,
like when you talk,

176
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.470
like sometimes I tweet and she'll tweet shit back at me.
Jam.

177
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.280
Paul also like wash your pussy and she'll tell me,
wash my dick.
You know?

178
00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.630
So when you have that mental,
once you've gone through everything in La,

179
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:32.700
you suck the Cox.
I'm not saying she's a cock sucker,

180
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.090
I'm just saying that once you suck the cock,
you've taken the lunches,

181
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.180
you grow and you grow as a standup and one day you go,
you know what?
This guy,

182
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:42.240
nothing to do with what I got to do.
I'm just going to rock every fucking state.

183
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:45.840
And that's what she does.
Well,
she's just,
she's just,
she just knows the,

184
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.170
that she's really funny.
She's really fun,
always working,

185
00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:53.280
always see on the airport.
And I was complaining,
always friendly,
you know,

186
00:10:53.281 --> 00:10:56.430
very sweet.
I really got,
it's always,
you know,

187
00:10:56.431 --> 00:11:00.210
there's some nights I go out to do comedy and you bump into 18 douche bags and

188
00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:00.481
you go,

189
00:11:00.481 --> 00:11:02.970
you do your set and you get in your car and you come home and there's some

190
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.980
nights that you go out and you see people,
you haven't seen the,
you hug.

191
00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:07.600
If you have a fucking,
you know,

192
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.500
you go outside to smoke a number and you go home and you're like,

193
00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:13.530
that was fucking great.
You know that these guys are still doing comedy.

194
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.660
They're on some other circuit.
Like last night I saw more curvy,
you know,

195
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.590
every time I see Mark Curry it's 15 minutes about the store and he makes me

196
00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:25.140
laugh.
He genuinely makes on,

197
00:11:25.141 --> 00:11:27.780
I bumped into him at Ralphs and that's how the whole relationship,

198
00:11:27.781 --> 00:11:30.870
so I said he's a great guy.
I have in the valley called flap is,
Nah,

199
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.080
you're just trying to do comedy.
You just want to get up and do spots.

200
00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:35.490
You've already had the TV show.

201
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.270
He's on another TV show as it really family with Chachi.

202
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.260
He's one of the guys in that.
Scott Bales got a show.
I'm like,
you know,

203
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.280
Nickelodeon and nick at night or something,

204
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.360
he's plays one of the black guys on the show.
Oh really?
Yeah,
but that,
hey,

205
00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:53.530
listen here,
he showed me off the air for 20 fucking years.

206
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:56.070
He's a very underrated,
oh,
he's on fire,
Bro.

207
00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:01.350
Area underrated how he writes a joke now that he listens to his joke and his

208
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:07.531
earphones and he walks to these clubs and he sees ways to make the joke better

209
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:09.520
in his head while he's listened to a very,
you know,

210
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:14.410
like you listen to yourself sometimes and I turned it off and fucking want to do

211
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:19.030
heroin.
Shut that off.
Oh,
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.
Um,

212
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:20.510
I,
uh,
I,

213
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:24.280
I recorded all my sets and I listened to most of them unless I didn't have to,

214
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.730
like I knew what,
what,
what trends.

215
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.260
By listening to them taking a chance and every time I do,

216
00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:33.580
I get that much stronger.
Yeah.
Every time I watch a video,
I get that much strong.

217
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.430
It's like watching game tape.
Yeah.
You got to analyze yourself.

218
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:39.040
Got To analyze yourself.
I just can't,
if you look like me,

219
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:41.770
you don't want to look at yourself.
I don't want to hear my fucking voice,

220
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.430
you know?
It's very hard for me to go to a movie that I'm in.

221
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.810
I want fucking cringe when my role comes on or something.

222
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.370
I don't like that stuff.
There's people that are great with it.
I just don't,

223
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.960
I don't want to hear my fucking voice when I'm hearing what I'm hearing my tapes

224
00:12:55.961 --> 00:12:58.210
from the night,
like when I go to laugh at,
when you go to the ice house,

225
00:12:58.211 --> 00:13:00.040
they always give you a set from before.

226
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.040
When I fucking put that on at the house or something,

227
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:04.930
I get sick to my fucking stomach.
You know,

228
00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:08.110
I don't focus on the material I'm focusing on May look at the size of my fucking

229
00:13:08.111 --> 00:13:08.944
head.

230
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.800
You're the size of my stomach fucking nose and that.

231
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:19.210
Well that's what we,
we hide from a lot of times,
but I do know that if you do it,

232
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.300
you just become that much better.
It's like watching game tape,
you know?

233
00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:24.040
It's like really watching game tape.

234
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:28.150
And I'll tell you when it gets really interesting when you do a weekend at a

235
00:13:28.151 --> 00:13:30.630
club,
but you do Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday,

236
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.160
Minneapolis and your tape all three nights.

237
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:38.340
That's very interesting to watch it when you leave that to see how you evolve or

238
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:42.370
three nights and mannerisms you made don't what mannerisms you want to take off.

239
00:13:42.371 --> 00:13:44.290
And especially for a new bit.
Yeah.

240
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:48.670
And it's amazing what habits we get that you try to break.
You know?

241
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.420
Like I always say,
do you know what I'm saying?
And that's a fucking ugly habit.

242
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:56.290
And I don't even know I'm saying it,
but I'm saying a lot of people say like,

243
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.380
like so it's very rough.
When you listened to yourself,

244
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.170
you see these little nuances that you're like,
God damn,

245
00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:05.410
I didn't hear myself say that.
You know when people should listen to themselves,

246
00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:07.000
the Moses,
when they say fuck too much,

247
00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.240
they don't realize you see it all the time.
I said,
well,
the fee,

248
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:13.000
but the extra fucks they extra fucks where it's like this fucking guy with his

249
00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:14.810
fucking thing with the fucking when you do that.

250
00:14:14.811 --> 00:14:17.480
But when you do that takes away from the word.
The word doesn't mean anything.

251
00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:19.980
He just wanted to fuck you crush the,
the,

252
00:14:19.981 --> 00:14:22.510
the power of it because you have overused it.

253
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.910
Like that was something they taught me in Boston.
That was a big,

254
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.420
big thing and bossy and breaking the Fuck Meta.
He's breaking up.
Fuck Meta.

255
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.490
It's uh,
it's really wild.
When you were in Denver,

256
00:14:33.491 --> 00:14:38.170
when you were coming up and not there,
nothing that,
nothing,
no art to it know,

257
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.550
like,
no.

258
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.560
Well that hadn't been Matt woods that wrote for Roseanne and a and a bunch of

259
00:14:44.561 --> 00:14:48.490
the guys.
And he did something on Tuesday nights before the open mic.
You know,

260
00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:51.100
it's really weird what happened with him and I,
he liked,

261
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.780
he was from Long Island and the first night I ever got on stage,
he was,
you know,

262
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.770
the comedy works doesn't open Mike on Tuesday.

263
00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.640
And then the last guys are real headlines,
does 45 minutes.

264
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:06.620
And my first time on stage,
June 18th,
1993 he was the headliner.

265
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.910
I had never seen a live standup show before.
And I went and I,

266
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:12.920
that's the night I knew I was going to get onstage.

267
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.910
I went with my ex wife and we went and I got on stage and he was the headliner.

268
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.240
So he came up to me right after when he goes,
dog here,
we don't stick with this.

269
00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:24.470
You're crazy.
He goes,
you got to write,
but you can,
as you've got 60% down,

270
00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:27.050
you've got the presence down.
And that's part of it.
He goes,
you got to right.

271
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:30.080
So we became friends,
you know,
and I would go and then one day I got a call,

272
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.620
like two years later he started a writing thing before the open Mike.
Well,

273
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.700
I was really fucked up then.

274
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.420
I used to work at the sports betting service and I'd have to take a bus from

275
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.650
boulder to Denver and I'd go pick up an eight ball and then called the club and

276
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:47.360
cancel.
I'm not going to fucking Denver by bus when I got an eight ball at home.

277
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:50.450
And sometimes I would do it,
but literally I had something.

278
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.540
And after a couple months,
one day he came up to me,
he's like,
let me ask you,

279
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.870
I had a t shirt on,
I had a white t shirt on it.
He came up and it was,

280
00:15:56.871 --> 00:15:59.720
can I talk to him about something?
He goes,
listen man,
you come here,

281
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.690
obviously you don't give a fuck.
He cause he funny,
funniest motherfucker.
Hey,

282
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.400
without even trying.
He goes,
could you imagine if he wrote,
he goes,

283
00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:11.510
half the time you cancel and you don't go to my classes.
He goes,

284
00:16:11.511 --> 00:16:15.410
why do you do this?
And Go,
I was going to punch this guy in the fucking mouth.

285
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.740
You don't want somebody who's like calling you out.
You're like,

286
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.050
what the fuck did I do to deserve this?
I could see if I said something,

287
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.740
but he kept going.
He was like,
you know,
you shouldn't even come here no more.

288
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.040
You are really talented,
but you're wasting your time.

289
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.160
I know you're doing wake up calls it huge.

290
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.800
I left there with my hands clenched and I walked to the bus stop and I walked

291
00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:37.040
back to clobber and I never wanted to see him again.

292
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.790
Never wanted to see him again.
But those words sank inside of me.

293
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:42.260
I didn't even go home and do the coke that night.

294
00:16:42.261 --> 00:16:45.590
He depresses me so much because he was right when somebody is right,

295
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.100
you can't raise your hand to them.
Sometimes you get mad,

296
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:50.560
but you're like the motherfuckers right.

297
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.930
And at least he had the balls to not call me out.
And for 20 people,

298
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.270
he pulled me aside and said these things,
he's from long island.

299
00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.830
He knew how to do it and he just read me the riot act.
So I never see him again.

300
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.970
I moved to La and I'm trying to get into a room.

301
00:17:03.971 --> 00:17:06.740
Do you know the first 90 days like getting out of Rehab when you moved to La,

302
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.930
you've got to get up.
You've got nothing happens at the couch.

303
00:17:08.931 --> 00:17:13.670
You've got to get out libraries,
coffee shops,
you know the Spanish rooms.

304
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.780
And one night I finally,
Rudy wouldn't return my calls.

305
00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:19.960
That's how I met Rudy Mourinho.
He wouldn't return my calls.
I should fuck it.

306
00:17:19.961 --> 00:17:23.060
I'm going down there,
you know,
wash bro.
I'm old school comic.

307
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.660
You're not remember returning my calls.
I'm going down there.
The Spanish room.

308
00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:27.890
I'm Spanish.
What the fuck?

309
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.260
I walk in and really sees me cause I go up and I had to follow that guy that

310
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:37.100
used to be the detective and don't like my women.
How I like my coffee.

311
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.560
Dwight's Carlos as,
no,
no,
not a lot.
Is Rocky.

312
00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:43.430
The guy in the,

313
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:47.570
in the late eighties and nineties that would go on stage with detective jacket

314
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.480
and a hat.
He would do the Improv when he would play that,
that stick from the,

315
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.960
I went to my office,
I smoked a cigarette was what was his name.
So I'm like,
God,

316
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.880
I'm there red band and I got to follow this fucking monster.

317
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.480
He had been on all the evening at the Improv,
all those shows.

318
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:05.520
But you could tell he was getting old.
The Rudy had him down at,

319
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:11.100
I grew up on fucking stage and I ripped that room apart.
You know,

320
00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:14.490
like when you're fired up about something,
you're mad.
Seven minutes.

321
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:17.100
I went up to caught the wave.
Just that room apart,

322
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:19.580
followed that guy like he was buddy.
You know when you get warm,

323
00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.410
got knife and you stick it in a Carvel cake and it goes right the fuck drew.

324
00:18:23.411 --> 00:18:26.910
It was just,
I just Heister that room when I got off stage.

325
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:30.600
Who Do you think was there?
Matt Woods in the back with Brian Dunkelman.
You guys.

326
00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:35.490
Brian Duncan.
He was on the first season of American idol and then he blew it.

327
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:39.450
They gave him $3 million and he fucking told,
what's his name,
the suck his dick.

328
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.980
So now he's,
he's doing the American idol and the Casino and some Indian casino,

329
00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:48.170
but he was there with him.
Matt Woods,
the guy who told me off with,

330
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.060
told me to get my life together and sort of hold those things to me.

331
00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:55.830
So when I walked off,
I saw him,
the Guy Tommy Sledge,
that was him.

332
00:18:55.831 --> 00:18:59.640
I had a follow Tommy Sledge.
So when I get off stage,
Matt Woods sees me.

333
00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:02.700
I killed and I walked up to him and I go,
Bro,

334
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.540
you have no idea how close you came to dying that night.
And he goes,

335
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.900
I know I could see it in your eyes,
but it did something to it.

336
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.100
And ever since that time we became tight friends.
Well,

337
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.610
I lost my communication about five years ago.

338
00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:18.120
His brother got sick in New Mexico and we lost numbers.

339
00:19:18.121 --> 00:19:21.510
But I always look on my Facebook because that guy sent me straight about common.

340
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:26.070
He pushed my buttons so much,
Bro.
In those days I was so fucked up,

341
00:19:26.071 --> 00:19:28.650
I would've killed him.
Seriously.
I would have fucked him up,

342
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.000
but he wasn't lying to me.
Right.
Every time I want to punch him,
I'm like,

343
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.960
he's not lying.
He's not fucking line.
So if Matt Woods is listening,

344
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.320
when they really knows how they got woods telling to thank you for making me a

345
00:19:40.321 --> 00:19:43.920
fucking man,
that's what he's good people can tell you things that wake you up,

346
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.950
changes.
Yada.
Didn't raise my hand for that guy.

347
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.680
Thank God I wouldn't have been the same fucking person.
Thank God.

348
00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:54.650
<v 0>Yeah,
no kidding.
Right.
I had a guy tell me that I started out really good,</v>

349
00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:58.520
but now I kind of dwindled off and I realized he was right.
He was another comic.

350
00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.570
Uh,
I believe his name is Jonathan McGuire.
He's a real nice guy.

351
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.090
He was one of the guys we all started out with together.

352
00:20:05.091 --> 00:20:07.000
There was a whole group of us,
uh,

353
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:11.240
in Boston and about six months in Maryland I was still fighting and I was kinda

354
00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.100
like half ass in comedy,
you know.

355
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.100
And he said that we were all like waiting in line to sign up for us,

356
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.370
open Mike night.
But he's just matter of factly about it.

357
00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.460
It's like you started off really good but you just kind of dwindled off and I

358
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.020
just sat there.
I didn't even respond to them.

359
00:20:24.021 --> 00:20:28.360
I just sat there and I immediately was like,
shit,
he's right.
He's right.

360
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:33.230
Say something.
It's my friends,
so I never got angry at him.
He just was right.

361
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.140
I mean,
he wasn't even saying it to be mean.
He wasn't a dick at all.

362
00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.940
He was just kind of being honest.
He's like,

363
00:20:37.941 --> 00:20:41.330
you started off really good with any kind of whittled off.
I was like,
fuck,

364
00:20:41.331 --> 00:20:44.480
I did and so then I realize like I got to quit fighting.

365
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.100
I got to quit martial arts.
I got to,
I can't just half this.
If I'm going to try

366
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.280
<v 5>to be a comedian,
I can't try to do two things at the same time.
It's too hard.</v>

367
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.370
That guy was like one of the main reasons why I made that choice,

368
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.600
that that experience where I knew I was just confronted with undeniable truth.

369
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.020
I don't think that people could do that anymore because there's a PC in those

370
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:06.300
comics still do it to each other.
It's important,
man.
Someone,

371
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.160
somebody tell you that bit sucks,
Dude.
That bits all fucked up.

372
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.470
Like what'd he say?
Like,
come on man.
The bid is like,

373
00:21:11.471 --> 00:21:13.840
there's a piece of this and that bit.
I didn't even think of that.
Yeah,

374
00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:17.500
I remember that.
This part of that,
that's this guy's thing.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

375
00:21:17.501 --> 00:21:19.150
yeah.
Fuck.
That happens.

376
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:21.780
Like you got to have a guy come up to you and tell you like you might be on,

377
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:22.990
you might forget.

378
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.350
Like I had a buddy of mine forgot that he had heard a joke and then started

379
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:29.980
repeating it and then I said to this Dennis Miller's joke,
it's like shit.

380
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.080
You could see in his face like,
fuck,

381
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.290
if someone's not there for you to tell you that bid socks,

382
00:21:34.291 --> 00:21:37.900
so that bit stolen or that bit's hack,
you might accidentally fuck up.

383
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:41.690
It's possible.
You know you need,
you need guys to be able to tell you no,

384
00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.860
I'm very happy that Matt,
which called me out that night.
It was,

385
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:48.880
I still remember going there with a fucking future it onto the comedy works.

386
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.940
It was one of the best clubs in the country.
Tuesday night,

387
00:21:51.941 --> 00:21:53.840
this 200 people middle watching open mic.

388
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.760
I'd go up there and kill just by talking three minutes because it's Denver.

389
00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:01.780
Just my accent kills.
Just the accent kills.
Just me going up there.

390
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.470
Just talking about the Broncos being friendly and being friendly kills,
you know,

391
00:22:05.471 --> 00:22:10.300
it's just,
uh,
it really was a,
he really and,
and him and all those guys.

392
00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:14.860
Matt Woods,
Matt Berry,
Matt Barry ended up selling like six shows to NBC.

393
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.860
Big Time writers still around.
Well,

394
00:22:17.861 --> 00:22:20.920
it's also important for someone to cut you down to size because when you're

395
00:22:20.921 --> 00:22:24.190
starting out you have a really distorted perception of how good you are.

396
00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.410
You think you're way better than you really are.
Well,

397
00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:28.750
that's what the comedy for that was.
That's what the comedy store,

398
00:22:28.751 --> 00:22:33.670
original rooms for the comedy store,
original room.
I love going in on a Sunday.

399
00:22:33.671 --> 00:22:36.100
When you come back from someone,
you just kill for four days,

400
00:22:36.101 --> 00:22:40.120
his shit and you're like,
watch this bitch and you go up there and often happen.

401
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:44.740
Nothing,
nothing.
And you'll eat dick.
I just destroyed it.

402
00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:49.300
Minneapolis for three nights and here I am on a Sunday night die and unfair

403
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.680
during the early show,

404
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:54.130
like the seven and nine where you would see that on Sunday nights especially

405
00:22:54.131 --> 00:22:57.970
cause guys would do weekend somewhere else and do really well and come in and

406
00:22:57.971 --> 00:22:59.110
just get humbled.

407
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:04.930
It is really the devil's room man.
Devil's room.

408
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.810
He'd make you sell your soul.
That's how he make you sell your soul,

409
00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:09.090
but he was seeing your bomb in there.

410
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.900
It was good for both of us as a transitionary period,
but that type of room,

411
00:23:13.901 --> 00:23:17.410
like especially high conflict,
no crowd control,

412
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.530
that becomes like you develop a more hostile style.

413
00:23:20.531 --> 00:23:23.860
Then it's kind of necessary because of that.
Sometimes that can be really funny.

414
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.240
You know both of us,

415
00:23:25.241 --> 00:23:29.440
I think a lot of our style develop because of the hostility of that room I have,

416
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:30.940
I am thankful.

417
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:36.450
I am thankful because one night I got a call maybe eight years ago and it was a

418
00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:38.710
Thursday night in Houston,
a Wednesday night and Houston,

419
00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:43.711
they had maybe 20 people in the audience and Johnny Sanchez fucking destroyed

420
00:23:44.051 --> 00:23:46.010
the room,
destroyed

421
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.860
<v 4>the room.
To the point where Pete called me drunk and he goes,</v>

422
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.910
I saw something tonight.
I only saw two people do.
He goes,
well,
you could.

423
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:57.950
Every one of my Wednesdays is dead.
The eye line is bomb.
There's only two people.

424
00:23:57.951 --> 00:24:00.350
There was only one who could kill with 20 people in the room.

425
00:24:00.351 --> 00:24:02.780
That was you two I saw Johnny Sanchez.

426
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.530
Johnny Sanchez called me the next day and said that to me.
He goes,

427
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:09.500
it's really hard to believe that people don't do this.

428
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.850
We do this every night at the comedy store.
Yeah.

429
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.350
What we did every night at the fucking comedy store,
eight people,

430
00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.320
cause I went up at 1245 bro.
You know,

431
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.860
there's eight people and they've already heard every premise,

432
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.550
every joke,
every fucking newsline.

433
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:30.230
So you have to go up there and just come out,
you know?
Yeah.

434
00:24:30.231 --> 00:24:33.620
You got to come out like John Jones on the fucking floor come.
That crawling

435
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:37.850
<v 0>big part of why Kennison became Kennison Tennyson was the cleanup batter.</v>

436
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.300
Kennison would go on at like one o'clock or 12 o'clock at night depending on,

437
00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:42.101
you know,
whatever night was,

438
00:24:42.101 --> 00:24:46.100
he was like the Kinison spot was the late spot at night and you know,

439
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:49.520
all these different comics had worked out already.
The audience,

440
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:52.520
you could start an audience at the comedy store at eight o'clock you could sit

441
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:54.680
down at eight o'clock and stay there till two o'clock in the morning.

442
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.960
Nobody kicks you out.
The show just keeps going.

443
00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.550
So Kennison would go up after who knows how many hours and hours and hours of

444
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:04.330
premises is setups and punchlines and he would,
yeah.

445
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:09.280
<v 6>Oh,
reset the whole room.
I love it.
I love it.</v>

446
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.870
I was married for two fucking years.
Hell will be like club med.

447
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:23.120
<v 0>This is fat and fucking sweaty with an overcoat on like everything was off.</v>

448
00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.750
He had sneakers on and a t shirt with an overcoat and it was like,

449
00:25:26.751 --> 00:25:29.240
what is this guy doing?
What's the flux going on in here?

450
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:34.510
Screaming with the power of a preacher with a head injury when he was a preacher

451
00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:38.690
with a head injury.
Greatest comic of all time

452
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:44.660
came out of a head injury.
Is that what it was?
Yeah.
You ever read his book?

453
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:46.970
Brian actually gave it to me.
I already have it.

454
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.250
Brian gave it to me for Christmas.
It's out there in the,

455
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.520
in the front it's called brother Sam.
Yeah,
Joey actually once I read it,

456
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.350
<v 4>I read it all to me in Seattle.</v>

457
00:25:54.351 --> 00:25:56.300
I haven't read it since [inaudible] 95 when they used to.

458
00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.320
That's the one when they talk about Houston walking down to a bar and then they

459
00:26:00.321 --> 00:26:02.600
would talk about going to the comedy store and eat and the condiments

460
00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.750
<v 0>and my brother Sam is the cherries and the brother wrote it.
A big,</v>

461
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:11.160
big part of it that keeps sticking with me was that he was like this really

462
00:26:11.161 --> 00:26:14.310
normal quiet kind of kid and then he got hit in the head.

463
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:19.700
He got like hit by a car and he got really fucked up and when he recovered he

464
00:26:20.161 --> 00:26:24.990
became this reckless fucking maniac.
He became Kennison.
So you know,

465
00:26:24.991 --> 00:26:29.940
a big part of what made him so amazing might have been an accident.

466
00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:31.800
Like that happens sometimes.

467
00:26:31.801 --> 00:26:34.530
Like there was a story recently about a guy who got hit in the head.

468
00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.560
He had some sort of a head injury and then he came out of it and he could play

469
00:26:37.561 --> 00:26:41.710
music.
Like there's weird things that happen sometimes with

470
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:44.550
<v 4>the school,
with a girl that had it injury and the,
she got huge</v>

471
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.700
<v 5>tits and I'm not trying to be funny.
I wish I was lying to you.</v>

472
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:51.660
This chick was flat chest with his fuck.
Got a head injury her freshman year.

473
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:56.940
By the time she was a junior hood Titsworth fucking ginormous and should become

474
00:26:56.941 --> 00:27:01.350
like this sex fucking crazy chick.
Like I went to grammar school with her.

475
00:27:01.351 --> 00:27:04.050
I knew she wasn't a sex fiend and a,

476
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.530
I bumped into like when she was a senior and she was fucking nuts.

477
00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:09.300
I was a junior.
I was like,
Jesus,

478
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.560
why he fucking tits and just wanting to fuck.
Just,
just,
you know,

479
00:27:13.561 --> 00:27:16.350
like if this guy doesn't fuck me,
y'all gonna fuck me.
And I'm like,
ah.

480
00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:21.000
I don't think,
think it was not that you said that.

481
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.230
She's on Facebook and now she won't talk to me.
Now.
She made up,
I,

482
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.970
my buddy of mine bumped into her and she goes,
I don't talk to that motherfucker.

483
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.080
Listen,
talk to me.
Because she wasn't,
you wouldn't fuck her.

484
00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:34.260
I don't know what it was.
And I,
and I had in the freshmen,

485
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.780
that's the girl I got left back over.
Oh Wow.

486
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.090
In the seventh grade for meeting a pussy and shit like that.

487
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.390
She wouldn't let me bang her.

488
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.110
I just dry hump and suck the teddies and stuff like that.

489
00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:46.710
Then she had a head injury when she was a freshman.
I was a single stop.
Brian,

490
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:51.000
an eighth grader,
teenager credits,
musical talent to head injury.

491
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.120
We'll play this cause it's pretty crazy shit.
That's amazing.

492
00:27:54.121 --> 00:27:59.040
So she became a free from a head injury and injury.
I'm not shocked man.
You know,

493
00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:01.830
we had a guy on the podcast,
Dr. Mark Gordon,

494
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:04.170
who is a specialist in traumatic brain injuries,

495
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.100
dealt with soldiers and athletes and all these different people.
And you know,
he,

496
00:28:08.101 --> 00:28:09.330
the way he talks about it,
man,

497
00:28:09.331 --> 00:28:14.331
it makes you really fucking question how smart it is to get hit in the head on a

498
00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:18.540
regular basis because when this guy starts talking to me about what can happen,

499
00:28:18.541 --> 00:28:20.610
like he was talking about like water skiing,

500
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:24.860
water scheme that jumping up and down on water skis can fuck your brain up,

501
00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.930
give you brain damage because your brain is sloshing around inside your skull.

502
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.440
I never even thought of that.
He was like,
it wouldn't even be a concussion.

503
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:36.830
Like you would be damaging your brain by just your brain sloshing inside like

504
00:28:36.871 --> 00:28:40.170
headbanging.
Like there might be a reason why headbangers are so fucking goofy.

505
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:45.450
One of the reasons where they by mistake and your offer a death in the shower

506
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.710
coming up that handle with the salt.

507
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.800
Like I banged my head one time that I was off for two fucking days.
I was off.

508
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:56.750
I was a,
what do I mean by off?
I didn't get voices or just didn't feel,

509
00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:01.200
you feel me.
You know what?
I got a concussion my freshman year playing football.

510
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:05.790
Think about it now.
Yeah,
I felt a little off for a few days.
You're not yourself.

511
00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:07.110
Well,
you know Ryan Parsons,

512
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.320
Ryan Parsons got hit in the head with a golf ball and he told me he wasn't the

513
00:29:10.321 --> 00:29:14.760
same for six months.
He said he got hit with a line drive,

514
00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:15.990
cracked him right in the head.

515
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.020
He said he went down like a meteor came from this guy.
I mean,

516
00:29:19.021 --> 00:29:23.610
he hit him right in the fucking head,
like really bad.
That's a dangerous thing.

517
00:29:23.611 --> 00:29:25.920
A golf ball to the fucking head.
Like people think that's funny.

518
00:29:25.921 --> 00:29:28.380
You're laughing at you.
Have you like Ryan and you're laughing.

519
00:29:28.381 --> 00:29:30.870
I like them because we'll get to at night with a guy who was playing golf,

520
00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:36.590
playing golf.
He's playing golf.
Oh No,
fuck you don't be playing fucking golf.

521
00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:38.940
Easy to cop and a headgear.
Did you go,

522
00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.160
did you hear about the foreign accent syndrome where the woman

523
00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:47.290
<v 0>just turned into like a Japanese lady and she's never even heard of?
Well,</v>

524
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:51.340
she speaks with an accent.
They know no one's ever learned to an actual language.

525
00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:56.050
Yeah,
she just took some guy,
Ritchie Dick.
He fucked her English.

526
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:58.270
You fuck the ring?
It was you put a gun in their mouth.
Shut.

527
00:29:58.271 --> 00:30:03.170
Chip Teleo their findings for the first time.
What is this here?

528
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.280
I want to see that kid.
Let's play that video that I asked to pull out.

529
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:11.730
The kid is a fascinating story because he got hit in the head and he credits

530
00:30:11.771 --> 00:30:15.100
that to his musical talent.
A brain injury.

531
00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.600
Not that you should go fucking hitting your head.
You know?

532
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:22.900
It's not always you become a comedic genius or a musical genius.
Poly.

533
00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.590
Somebody who's got a buddy at home.
Are you ready?
It may with them.
Yeah,

534
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.850
I suck at comedy.
Come on.

535
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:31.330
You're going to hit me in the fucking head and I'm going to get better,
bro.
Some,

536
00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:33.040
some guys with head injuries are funny.

537
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.610
You just had it up.
Yeah,
it's not playing right.
God dammit.

538
00:30:39.611 --> 00:30:42.640
I forgot to bring that new laptop.
Please remind me

539
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:46.930
our laptops.
Oldest Fuck

540
00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:47.220
<v 4>No.</v>

541
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:51.280
Every day we find that more and more things about brains and especially with the

542
00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:56.170
NFL and the guy shooting himself and what's going on it.
Listen,

543
00:30:56.171 --> 00:31:00.310
man,
I think that you're right.
I think that you had that you have the magic,

544
00:31:00.311 --> 00:31:04.320
you don't know how many hits it's going to take.
Nobody knows.
Nobody knows.

545
00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:07.870
Nobody knows how many times you do this until one time you hit the right thing.

546
00:31:07.871 --> 00:31:09.790
Right.
And when people get knocked out,
what happens after that?

547
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.550
They got knocked out all the time.
Right?
Does that happen?

548
00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.500
<v 0>Depending upon how much time you give it.</v>

549
00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:19.160
The only person that I've seen recover from a brutal knockout and retain his

550
00:31:19.161 --> 00:31:22.460
chin,
his Bisbing Bisbing got knocked out by Henderson,

551
00:31:22.461 --> 00:31:25.340
is one of the worst knockouts ever,
but hasn't been stopped since,

552
00:31:25.341 --> 00:31:28.910
except for one time against Vitor Belfort.
And it was a head kick.
I mean,

553
00:31:28.911 --> 00:31:31.760
everybody gets stopped by that kick,
the kick that hit [inaudible].

554
00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.330
If you're a fucking human being and he had kicks you with that Shin to the head,

555
00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.490
most likely they're going to,
you're going to go down at least.

556
00:31:37.491 --> 00:31:38.610
And that's what happened at Biz Bang.

557
00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.540
He went down and he wasn't even unconscious.
He got Tko.

558
00:31:41.541 --> 00:31:44.240
The referee stopped the fight and you know,
he didn't object.

559
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.290
It was a good stoppage.

560
00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.100
But the point is he didn't lose his chin from that one knockout.

561
00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.780
It's Chin's still pretty solid.
He's been hit real hard.

562
00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.160
Just that one knockout by vittores.
The only other one I have PTSD.

563
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:58.520
I'm sure you do.
What are you talking about you?
I know you do.

564
00:31:58.521 --> 00:32:01.780
Just by hearing your stories all through our friendship.
I know for a fact

565
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.610
<v 4>that some nights I laid down and I'll think of something and I'll think about</v>

566
00:32:05.611 --> 00:32:09.740
the worst case scenario and I'll say,
why did that pop into my head?
What?

567
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:13.200
What is that reasoning?
Why did that pop into my fucking head?

568
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.530
And then I think about early on in my life,

569
00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:20.010
those first fucking 15 years was just brutal,
brutal.
You know,

570
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.250
my mom said that the first three years after my dad died,

571
00:32:23.251 --> 00:32:26.940
every time I go would open,
I would turn around just to see if it was my dad,

572
00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:31.560
you know,
that has to stay with you,
rusty alive.
Then my boy is dying.

573
00:32:31.561 --> 00:32:35.460
You know Dominic's brushy out and Anthony and my mother dying all at one shot.

574
00:32:35.461 --> 00:32:36.810
So you finding your mother.

575
00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.820
I always know that when I see somebody like Anthony,

576
00:32:40.821 --> 00:32:45.350
I saw at 6:30 AM six 30 at night.
Dawg,
you want to come over and eat?
Nah,

577
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:47.990
my mom made it.
Cool.
You want me to come over after dinner?
Nah,

578
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.310
I got to do homework and shit.

579
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:53.630
I'll see you tomorrow at school and then he went home.
His mother had no milk.

580
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.250
He got in the car with his brother,

581
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.680
went to a supermarket and some guy ran a red light drunk.
Boom kills.

582
00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:02.420
I go to school next day.
Where's Anthony?
You didn't hit what happened though?

583
00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.150
What happened?
He died last night.
How can he die?

584
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:09.050
I was with him until six 30 what did he do from six 30 at night?

585
00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.840
That we were fucking in the eighth grade.
What'd you do?
Go to a disco.

586
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.320
So I know for a fact sometimes,
and I haven't gotten to talk to anybody,

587
00:33:15.321 --> 00:33:16.280
but I started getting this.

588
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:19.970
I started getting a little stronger last four years maybe because I'm off the

589
00:33:19.971 --> 00:33:22.460
blow.
Maybe because I'm off the blow now.

590
00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.350
It's coming to haunt me a little bit differently.

591
00:33:24.351 --> 00:33:28.280
It doesn't affect me in my everyday life.
It affects me in different situations.

592
00:33:28.281 --> 00:33:32.480
Like with my daughter,
like when Terry drives with my daughter,
I get nervous,

593
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.190
I get nervous with my friends.

594
00:33:34.191 --> 00:33:39.191
I get nervous about my friends a lot pro a lot because I know what it is to lose

595
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:42.530
tight friend.
I know that you can't recover from that.
You know,

596
00:33:42.531 --> 00:33:44.450
we're very fortunate that we all have each other.

597
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.840
So I know that this Ptsd Abbott at some levels,

598
00:33:47.841 --> 00:33:51.710
you know when I hear a gun fire I fucking go crazy.

599
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.300
Even on TV,

600
00:33:53.301 --> 00:33:55.790
like sometimes I think about what these kids go through when you were in a

601
00:33:55.791 --> 00:33:56.624
school,

602
00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:00.590
you can't imagine guys being 12 and being at a school and some guy comes in with

603
00:34:00.591 --> 00:34:04.190
one of these new fucking the age guns,
you know,
you go hunting,

604
00:34:04.191 --> 00:34:05.660
you know the shotgun sounds like,

605
00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:10.280
you know the 45 and sounds like you think of these new m 16 is that they come
in,

606
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.440
keep those fucking clicks and those texts,
you hear the bullets going in.

607
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:20.400
All that shit affects me.
Even on TV,
Bro.
Even on fucking TV when I watch it,

608
00:34:20.401 --> 00:34:20.750
I got to like,

609
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:24.860
I don't want to watch this shit that you called me and told me you were going to

610
00:34:24.861 --> 00:34:28.970
the movies.
And I was like,
don't go see that fucking movie Wall Street.

611
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.230
That was too crazy for me.

612
00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:33.440
But it goes to show you what I really want to talk to you about.

613
00:34:33.441 --> 00:34:37.760
How crazy where the 80s that's not exaggerate.
The eighties were insane.

614
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.820
That's not exactly what,
especially with cocaine.

615
00:34:39.821 --> 00:34:43.430
And I think that was all the nineties actually because I think 87 was when the

616
00:34:43.431 --> 00:34:46.400
big crash was it.
He says when he started working,
that's,

617
00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.740
that was his first day in the office still fueling mother fuckers.

618
00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:53.890
November 18th at 87 something.
It was around that when we crashed November 8th,

619
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:58.110
November 10th.
You know how I know I got kidnapped the guy a week later.
Real.

620
00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.590
Yeah.
I kidnapped the grand 87.
Yeah,
getting that.

621
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:04.460
So I remember living in newspapers.
I remember,
uh,
that,

622
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.090
but the 80s when I went to see that movie and they saw the blow,

623
00:35:08.091 --> 00:35:09.760
like my heart stopped a couple times,

624
00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.800
but by the 20 minute mark when I went to see that,

625
00:35:12.801 --> 00:35:15.770
when I look to set up more with the Lemley,
I saw it for white people walk,

626
00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:19.520
run out of there like Jenny,
how about when he was blowing coke in her asshole?

627
00:35:19.521 --> 00:35:22.350
I'm harassed.
That is raw.
But then was that,

628
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.880
that was it in her ass on his blog when they're young and I was watching Boogie

629
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.650
nights when they go over.
That's my favorite scene.
And a lot of movies.

630
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.470
Which one would mark Walberg and the guy go to the guy's house.

631
00:35:33.471 --> 00:35:37.050
The guy fired man too.
And the Chinese guy with the firecracker dog,

632
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.220
you know what I mean?
Houses.
I went

633
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.000
<v 0>to three in the morning that will like that.
Really?
Like,</v>

634
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.760
just like you walk in and you're like,
something May,
right.

635
00:35:44.761 --> 00:35:49.250
We went to one in Arizona or something.
Yeah.
You remember that?
Those parties.

636
00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.510
They'll walk in and you're like,

637
00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:53.830
you know when something ain't right and something's going to go down at this

638
00:35:53.831 --> 00:35:58.560
house waiting for Vampires fucking blow and led to spray for the ceiling.

639
00:35:58.561 --> 00:36:01.950
Like the opening scene in blade.
It's fucking crazy.

640
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:07.350
That's a lot of it is that amphetamine,
cocaine uppers sort of party scene.

641
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.420
It's very sketchy.
Like if you're,

642
00:36:09.421 --> 00:36:12.210
you're going and meeting some people that are involved in that world.

643
00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:13.500
You don't even know it like you think,

644
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:16.890
you think they just how I see it seems like a nice guy.
We were in Phoenix.

645
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:19.500
I didn't even know that everyone was on coke until Brian pointed out.

646
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.920
Me and Brian were hanging.
I'd never done coke.
I know what,

647
00:36:22.921 --> 00:36:26.520
when people are kind of being speedy,
I kind of guessed that they're on coke.

648
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.710
But since I've never done it,
I don't,
I don't know the actual full patois.

649
00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.700
So yeah,
I can tell if someone's high.
I can tell if someone's drunk.

650
00:36:32.701 --> 00:36:36.240
Cause I've been hiding,
I've been drunk.
The cook things like a guest,

651
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.660
just a guest from me.
But we were in this club and Brian Goes,
you know,

652
00:36:39.661 --> 00:36:43.400
everyone here is on coke.
And I was like,
everyone,
he's like,
everyone's on coke.

653
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:46.170
Everybody look around,
everyone touching their dose.
He goes in,

654
00:36:46.171 --> 00:36:50.640
they were all like planning businesses look around and they were,

655
00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.900
they were all touching each other's nose.
They're like,
Geez,

656
00:36:52.901 --> 00:36:56.100
I'm fucking totally into that man.
We can show that shit through my company.

657
00:36:56.101 --> 00:36:59.940
Or you're a company and they're jacked up making plans that will never take

658
00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:04.020
money.
I remember him in the morning.
Yeah.
It's fascinating thing,

659
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:08.250
you know.
And that's the other thing on top of all the deaths I saw and all that.

660
00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:12.890
Then you got 25 years of fucking heavy duty powder.
Yeah.
You know,

661
00:37:12.891 --> 00:37:15.270
and like I told you guys towards the end,
the last three years,

662
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:19.320
I knew it was time to stop snoring at night when my spine would start fucking

663
00:37:19.321 --> 00:37:23.670
hurt.
And that was the bottom of my spine would start hurting.

664
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.730
And I feel like little firecrackers going off like little electronic pop,
pop,

665
00:37:27.731 --> 00:37:32.400
pop up.
My Bow,
I knew it was time to quit right then and there.
Wow.

666
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.460
That's crazy.
They lecturer,
you know,

667
00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:38.550
it's funny how I always wanted to write a book about my life.

668
00:37:38.551 --> 00:37:40.170
I don't want to write a book about my life and mom,

669
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.170
I want to write a book about the 26 year listening should be,

670
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:47.070
you'd be crazy to write a book.
This is what you should do,
what you should do.

671
00:37:47.071 --> 00:37:48.330
If you want to do a story in your life,

672
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:51.180
you do a story where a guy puts a fucking camera in front of you and you start

673
00:37:51.181 --> 00:37:52.530
talking to lose.

674
00:37:52.531 --> 00:37:57.110
You talking loses 90% of the entertainment value of anything you say you're,

675
00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.450
you're a master talker.
You,
you,
when you talk,
it's,
it's entertaining.

676
00:38:00.451 --> 00:38:01.500
It's beautiful to listen to.

677
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.690
Why would you want to limit that to the printed word?

678
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.830
That's the last thing you want to do.

679
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.590
You want to make an audio book at the very least,

680
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:11.010
but more likely you want to look at your face.
He'd want to do a video,

681
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:14.970
maybe an audio book with a video companion to it,
but don't write it.

682
00:38:14.971 --> 00:38:18.540
Bark too much would be missing.
You're too,
you're too,

683
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.310
it's like that.
That form of expression.
It's too limited for you.

684
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:24.810
It's not that it's not,

685
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:27.600
you know that you couldn't write a book and wouldn't be interesting.

686
00:38:27.601 --> 00:38:28.590
I'm sure it'd be interesting,

687
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:33.980
but a big part of your genius is your relaying of information like you who's

688
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.650
listening to you and you because of the fact that you grew up in this really

689
00:38:38.651 --> 00:38:42.880
fucked up way because the fact that you grew up with all this loss in this like

690
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:43.840
extreme,

691
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:49.590
like extreme desire for friendship and extreme loyalty to your friends like you.

692
00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:55.420
One of the things that I love about you is the same thing that I strive for

693
00:38:55.421 --> 00:39:00.040
myself is to be extremely loyal to my friends.
And that's,
that's who you are.

694
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.730
That's what you got.
But all that comes into play like the,

695
00:39:03.731 --> 00:39:06.310
the immediacy and the importance.
When you're talking to people,

696
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.480
like there's a vulnerability,

697
00:39:07.481 --> 00:39:09.880
there's a lot of shit going on that you're just going to miss in the print.

698
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.790
You know,
I'm not trying to blow smoke up your ass straight,

699
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:17.810
not the first guy that said,
fuck a book.
You just talk,
you just talk.
You're,

700
00:39:17.811 --> 00:39:19.360
you're,
you're,
you know,

701
00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.850
you're the funniest guy on the planet when it comes to just talking and telling

702
00:39:21.851 --> 00:39:22.680
stories.

703
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.990
<v 4>It's just weird that you know,
you,
uh,
I was,</v>

704
00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:29.160
I went to Minneapolis and the guy was clean and we were talking in between shows

705
00:39:29.161 --> 00:39:33.360
about coke stories and we're both looking at each other like fucking crazy shit

706
00:39:33.361 --> 00:39:35.910
at that made you do like 30 years of my life.

707
00:39:35.911 --> 00:39:39.120
26 years of my life was focused around that.

708
00:39:39.121 --> 00:39:41.200
Like my thoughts at one part of the day we're like,

709
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:42.360
where am I going to do it tonight?

710
00:39:42.361 --> 00:39:47.361
Or not like the same way people think about eating and I'm not glamorizing it on

711
00:39:47.491 --> 00:39:51.780
a style judging it.
It's something that I want to just a,
it's scary.
It's ugly.

712
00:39:51.781 --> 00:39:55.530
Like when I think about,
I'm like,
God damn the people I bumped into,

713
00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.460
the women I bumped into,
it was like,
well,
especially east coast,
right?

714
00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:01.800
And if I was selling my soul,
you know,

715
00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:05.280
they were fucking definitely selling that fucking soul,
you know,
in a huge way.

716
00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.050
The things they would,
I mean,
it was just a,

717
00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:11.310
it's really fucking interesting where you live.
And that's for any addiction,
Joe.

718
00:40:11.311 --> 00:40:15.930
That's the fucking,
those pills,
you know,
which is really destroying us.

719
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:21.000
It's the pills.
It's not the fucking math that on Tennessee,
not us,

720
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:24.090
but it's the fucking doctors and these fucking prescriptions,
you know,

721
00:40:24.091 --> 00:40:25.800
in Hollywood,
everybody is on the fucking prescription.

722
00:40:25.801 --> 00:40:30.090
You do know that everybody,
90% of the I'll fucking prescriptions for something.

723
00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:33.300
Even if he go to Aa and [inaudible].
And I know what in Hollywood,

724
00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.020
I shouldn't say to the AIA as a whole,
but I know people in the Hollywood,

725
00:40:37.021 --> 00:40:40.140
they'll look me in the face and go,
I'm clean and sober from alcohol,

726
00:40:40.141 --> 00:40:41.130
but I'm taking pills.

727
00:40:41.131 --> 00:40:43.380
The doctor gave me so I don't kill somebody for don't do this.

728
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.960
So don't do that too.
I sleep at night.
So I mean,
yeah.
And you know,

729
00:40:45.961 --> 00:40:49.350
you go to their house,
look at 19 fucking pills.
What's the fucking difference,

730
00:40:49.351 --> 00:40:50.170
you know?

731
00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:53.230
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah.
You,</v>

732
00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:57.430
did you listen to podcast yesterday with war machine?
No,
no,
no.
It's anxiety too.

733
00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:01.450
And I takes Lexapro because of it.
But he's clean and sober.
Other than that.

734
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:05.950
And what'd he say about the Lexapro helps them,
helps them.
Uh,
you know,
he,

735
00:41:05.951 --> 00:41:10.210
he did a year in solitary.
Oh.
Then when they put him in jail in Nevada,

736
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.550
they found out he was an MMA fighter and a,

737
00:41:12.551 --> 00:41:16.150
they decided to remove him from general population for everybody's safety.

738
00:41:16.151 --> 00:41:19.450
And he's got a fucking grenade tattooed on his neck and the kids built like a

739
00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:21.700
pit bull,
you know,
so they're like,
fuck this guy.

740
00:41:21.701 --> 00:41:24.940
He's not beating up any guards or whatever he's planning on,
you know,
let's,

741
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:25.840
let's put them in solitary.

742
00:41:25.841 --> 00:41:29.740
So they just decided to put them in solitary for a whole year.
Crazy story,

743
00:41:29.741 --> 00:41:32.830
but fucked him up.
It was already fucked up going in.

744
00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.920
And they took him off the Lexapro when he got in.
Crazy story.

745
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:40.070
So he's going through withdrawals because he's been on this stuff,

746
00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:41.570
and I don't know how Lexapro works,

747
00:41:41.571 --> 00:41:43.550
but I'm assuming you probably have to wean yourself off from it

748
00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.350
now don't they let you bring that in if you're in prison some places,

749
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:51.110
but not in Nevada.
They let them bring it in.
In California,

750
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:52.790
if he was arrested in California,

751
00:41:52.791 --> 00:41:54.200
they'd let him bring it in and they would take it.

752
00:41:54.201 --> 00:41:58.280
He would go to the prison doctor and they would give him his medicine but not in

753
00:41:58.281 --> 00:42:01.710
Vida,
in Nevada.
And the father was like,
fuck you,
you're a criminal.

754
00:42:01.711 --> 00:42:04.830
We're barely gonna keep you alive.
We're not going to give you shit.
He could sue.

755
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.310
Maybe.
I Dunno.
Maybe

756
00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:11.270
<v 4>it's a,
it should need it.
It's like a religion.
Yeah.
You know,</v>

757
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.160
if you go to jail and you're a Muslim,
you need vegetarian fucking meals.

758
00:42:14.161 --> 00:42:16.470
They don't give you that Muslim diet.
You could sue them.

759
00:42:16.471 --> 00:42:19.080
It's part of your fucking religion is going to do it all the fucking time.

760
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.100
<v 0>That the case,
like if they're serving pork chops and if you're a Muslim,</v>

761
00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:22.550
they want,

762
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.110
<v 4>they're going to give you a fucking vege Italian.</v>

763
00:42:24.111 --> 00:42:27.800
I'm Muslim fucking dish man present.
Have a special fucking deal for you.

764
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:32.510
So have you.
All right.
I have sleep apnea.
I got to fucking county jail.
Okay.

765
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:36.380
Alright.
He killed somebody.
Whatever he lit the house on fire still got fucking,

766
00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:40.880
this is one of the only countries you have rights as a the accused as the

767
00:42:40.881 --> 00:42:43.430
accused.
You have rights in this country.
Tons of fucking writes.

768
00:42:43.431 --> 00:42:46.550
A lot of people don't know about,
so I go to La county the next fucking day.

769
00:42:46.551 --> 00:42:48.860
After the first night,
my attorney goes down and says,
guys,

770
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:52.670
either he needs to get transferred to a hospital for a sleep apnea.

771
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:54.410
We need to bring the machine and they're going to go,
Nah,

772
00:42:54.411 --> 00:42:56.780
we can't bring the machine.
And it could be a blog bombing there.

773
00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:59.630
They've got to transmit to a hot flash.
It takes three or four fucking days.

774
00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:02.630
My blood pressure goes up.
I got a heart attack.
Guess who's getting the suit?

775
00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:07.220
Can you imagine that?
Does that how it works or would you just deal with it?

776
00:43:07.221 --> 00:43:10.850
But he will know.
How can you deal with it?
You have a fucking,
you know,

777
00:43:10.851 --> 00:43:14.270
let's say you,
I know if you have a mental health issue,
you break a window.

778
00:43:14.271 --> 00:43:16.370
You know there are people who take,
don't take their medication,

779
00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.470
they break a window.
It take you into jail.

780
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.990
You want these people in here without that fucking medication.

781
00:43:20.991 --> 00:43:25.130
Same thing applies.
Anxieties is fucking silent killer for some people.

782
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.590
It's not at that.
I was never at that point for me,
but I know people that I've,

783
00:43:29.591 --> 00:43:34.100
I've spoken with that it's a fucking,
they can't be in certain situations.
Wow.

784
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.580
Because it's just mind boggling form.
Can you imagine being in solitary,

785
00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:41.810
being in a room like this?
No air conditioning,
no windows.
That does shit to you.

786
00:43:41.811 --> 00:43:45.680
Sometimes when I work out and I can't breathe and there's no doors opening the

787
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:49.160
gym,
I get fucking anxiety just cause I want to go out and just get out.

788
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:51.350
Just kind of have for five minutes just breathing the air.

789
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.730
I'm back just being cooped up in a corner doing fucking that lifts at the

790
00:43:55.731 --> 00:43:58.580
fucking,
the kettle bell thing.
Sometimes I got to walk through the door.

791
00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.680
Sometimes I make them open up the garage door.

792
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.900
I get anxiety just from being in that position,

793
00:44:02.901 --> 00:44:06.190
so I can't imagine what he did in an eight by six hours.

794
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:07.610
I'm very year for a year.

795
00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.270
I big as the fucking salary by the tiny and they give me shit and okay,

796
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.490
I know you were at home going,
Joey,
but he's a criminal.

797
00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:16.820
I understand that in this country,
the criminals,
the fucking,
I don't care.

798
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:18.260
Even the world trade fucking bomb.

799
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:21.560
Sammy the bull Gravano they were all under that fucking jail in Colorado

800
00:44:21.561 --> 00:44:24.830
Tomahawk.
Whatever it is,
they got rights they got right.

801
00:44:24.831 --> 00:44:27.080
You gotta give him that medication.
You got to give him this.
Otherwise,
yeah,

802
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:27.170
you're

803
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:30.160
<v 0>torturing them.
I mean the idea of punishing people for something,</v>

804
00:44:30.161 --> 00:44:32.010
it's very strange because

805
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.560
<v 4>the idea is that you're going to take some person,</v>

806
00:44:34.561 --> 00:44:39.060
you get to put them in jail for the rest of their life and make them like feel

807
00:44:39.061 --> 00:44:42.090
terrible and be just Moan and rot away.

808
00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:45.150
It's very like medieval and archaic,
but they couldn't be,

809
00:44:45.151 --> 00:44:48.660
they couldn't be a productive member of society.
Yeah.

810
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.130
Jails are not bad.
I'm not going to sit here and Pam and I,
I'm a felon.

811
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.550
I can't vote,
which you're trying to overthrow all that should exist.
They really,

812
00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.270
some states Obama wants to vote.
Oh,
I'm Bama wants to vote.

813
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:03.390
But it's funny because a majority of people with felonies in the country are

814
00:45:03.391 --> 00:45:06.450
black.
Well who would be next?
Because it actually,

815
00:45:06.451 --> 00:45:09.540
I shouldn't say Obama wants to vote because he won't be,
he won't be,

816
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:13.110
he won't be eligible.
But,
so who would be that?
They would benefit from that.

817
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:17.940
I got to pick some new black guy coming deep from the south is shit.
No,
I'm just,

818
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.320
but I saw that.
But public enemy coming true.
You never know.

819
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.470
You have a black planet baby.
It's really amazing.

820
00:45:25.471 --> 00:45:28.770
Like when I went in I had to refill,
so I had trouble sleeping.

821
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:32.250
They put me on fucking,
what's that shit they put you on when you're crazy?

822
00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:36.510
The thorazine,
thorazine prison.

823
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:40.470
Three weeks yet,
that's what it called thorazine.
Thorazine.

824
00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:43.680
They had me on that in prison for two or three weeks because I couldn't sleep at

825
00:45:43.681 --> 00:45:48.150
night.
Whoa.
So they have mis,
you know,
you have so many myths,

826
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:53.080
a misdiagnosis diagnosis in that.
Yeah.
Like they couldn't figure out something.

827
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.480
And I know,
you know,
like listen,
if,
uh,

828
00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.010
if it's a tough visit,

829
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.090
this is a very complicated subject in our country because everybody was going to

830
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:07.140
chime in on this,
you know,
but a guy who gets in trouble has rights.
No,

831
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:10.680
it's not right that we don't put somebody who smoked pot in jail for 26 fucking

832
00:46:10.681 --> 00:46:13.730
years.
But some guy who kills a fucking little girl,

833
00:46:13.731 --> 00:46:17.040
a little boy lights a house on fire,
has no respect for society,

834
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:20.130
needs to get put in jail.
Maybe that'll slow them down.

835
00:46:20.131 --> 00:46:25.110
We've discussed this before.
There's no rehabilitation in prison,
Bro.
There's no,

836
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:28.710
uh,
class that you take to come out and be a better person.

837
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:31.110
It's how much of this do you want to take?

838
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:35.510
How many times you know prison isn't about the food.
We goof here,
Huh?

839
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.580
The food or you're gonna get fucked in the shower.
That's all bullshit.

840
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:40.470
The thing that,
if you're a man,

841
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.590
can you imagine me coming into your room every morning kicking your bed?

842
00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.460
How would you feel every morning if I came into your room and just put the

843
00:46:47.461 --> 00:46:51.570
fucking light on at five and go Rogan,
get up,
bitch,
and kick your bed.

844
00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.750
How many mornings before you stab me?
Legitimately,

845
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.850
if I would've lived with you and I,
we looked downstairs,

846
00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:00.510
I came into your room every morning,
kick your fucking bed and said,
hey bitch,

847
00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.810
get up.
How long would it take you to stab me?

848
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:09.400
What have you had an eight year sentence?
Take a lot less.
And I'm a guard.
Well,

849
00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.300
I'm already a guard.
But what you're doing in life,

850
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:17.450
that's what makes you not want to come back to prison because it's not somebody

851
00:47:17.731 --> 00:47:20.680
fucking in the ass.
It's your manhood pro with me,
it was my man.

852
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.900
They took my man or the way.

853
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:25.590
There's a man telling me what the fuck to do and you have to listen and you have

854
00:47:25.591 --> 00:47:28.740
to listen and there's no two ways about it and they can treat you in a way that

855
00:47:28.741 --> 00:47:31.830
no one else in society is allowed to be.
That guy said to you,
Joe,

856
00:47:31.831 --> 00:47:33.850
you started out good,
but you teed it off.
Yeah,

857
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:37.350
we didn't get mad because it's not what you say.
It's how you say it.
Yeah.

858
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:40.000
Is another way to say that you're going to haul off and punch me in the fucking

859
00:47:40.001 --> 00:47:42.730
mouth and that's how they say it.
They're always testing you.

860
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:46.090
That thing that you have in you because they know they can and that's it.

861
00:47:46.091 --> 00:47:49.090
That's what makes you not want to come back.
When you look at that place and go,

862
00:47:49.091 --> 00:47:51.010
I never want to be put in this position again.

863
00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.920
Amanda is never going to talk to me and that fucking matter again,

864
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:58.180
I'll die before some motherfucker talks to me like that.
Wow.

865
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:01.070
There's two types of that.
There's some people you know,

866
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.030
but there's some people go in the inside like me,
you know,

867
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.130
how am I going to live without fucking Chinese food?

868
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:08.830
I mean these are the little things that I thought about,

869
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:13.010
but these are the decisions you make are not going back to prison and not going

870
00:48:13.011 --> 00:48:14.140
to prison is a bad thing,

871
00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:18.100
but people are bad fucking people and I need to get stopped in time with me.

872
00:48:18.101 --> 00:48:20.080
Joe Rogan.
I need it to get stopped sometimes.

873
00:48:20.081 --> 00:48:24.580
I had been doing drugs since I was 15 I was 27 years old.
It was,

874
00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:28.360
it was a six month process that didn't have to do drugs.

875
00:48:28.361 --> 00:48:32.800
I have to think about drugs that makes you see life a lot clear and it makes you

876
00:48:32.801 --> 00:48:35.530
ask you this question.
Do you want to be in this?
Do you really want to come back?

877
00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:39.490
I mean,
there's people that sit around all day talking about h block and Kansas.

878
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:44.050
You were there and Joe Rogan come on dog.
I was there.
That's the baddest place.

879
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:48.910
The pork chops are Tuesday bitches,
red band who did time in Columbus.

880
00:48:48.911 --> 00:48:51.910
I was in and that proud of doing this tour that they do.

881
00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:56.650
Why they plowed of doing this fucking prison tour.
I was up there.

882
00:48:56.651 --> 00:48:59.890
I partied out with him one time.
What did you party out?

883
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:03.040
You were in a fucking jail south shooting heroin.
Sharon.

884
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:06.160
A fucking needle with some other guy and your party and out.

885
00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:11.320
What the fuck party not is that some fucking black transvestite?
Suck your Dick.

886
00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:13.090
That's a party.
Really.

887
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:16.450
So you got to remember the mentality is some of these guys,
Bro,

888
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:21.160
this is it for them.
This is it,
bro.
I got a fat chick that sends me money.

889
00:49:21.161 --> 00:49:21.994
I'm straight.

890
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:26.250
They get some chick that wants a boyfriend in prison cause you know you've got a

891
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:28.030
thousand and I'm fucking dummies.
Yeah.

892
00:49:28.031 --> 00:49:31.360
What's that about thousand dudes that are in prison.

893
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:34.750
That's a common thousand of those dummies.
They don't fuck that.
Don't suck.

894
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.450
They just bring you groceries and then like,

895
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:41.110
and then it's funny cause let's say I date you,
right?

896
00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:44.800
Let's say I date this girl and she's bringing me groceries.
I'll ask her though.

897
00:49:44.801 --> 00:49:48.400
You got a homie to hook up with my boy over here and she'll say,
yeah,

898
00:49:48.401 --> 00:49:52.660
I got a homie for her.
She needs a boyfriend.
She'll be like 450 pounds.
She's fat.

899
00:49:52.661 --> 00:49:55.090
She's a recession.
But this bitch makes like 80,000 here.

900
00:49:55.091 --> 00:49:59.030
She's dying to have a boyfriend.
She goes to that jail,
she gets a boyfriend,

901
00:49:59.031 --> 00:50:03.130
they take pictures together on the weekends.
It's fucking crazy.
Wow.

902
00:50:03.131 --> 00:50:06.550
That's so weird.
And then not allowed conjugal visits,
right?
No.

903
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:08.740
Until then comes a time,
you know when you're short.

904
00:50:08.741 --> 00:50:11.440
But I don't think they allow conjugal visits because of Boston.

905
00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:16.270
I think when that guy was going to be president out of Massachusetts like 10

906
00:50:16.271 --> 00:50:18.670
years ago.
Yeah,
yeah.
Teen years ago,

907
00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:22.900
he got in trouble because the caucus had conjugal visits in Massachusetts and

908
00:50:22.901 --> 00:50:25.990
somebody killed somebody.
So they had to stop him across the country.
I don't,

909
00:50:25.991 --> 00:50:28.010
don't,
don't,
don't,
please don't.
I don't think it

910
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.510
<v 0>was a conjugal visit.
He had a release,
like a temporary release,</v>

911
00:50:32.511 --> 00:50:37.070
like a furlough.
He could go on the weekends somewhere and he killed somebody.

912
00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.500
Really?
Uh,
something.
I know the feds

913
00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:44.040
<v 4>like,
let's say you were in a loud pop or like my,
uh,
the,
the,
the,
uh,</v>

914
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:48.020
the low minimum code,
minimum security places.

915
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.710
I know you'd come in for the weekend and fuck somebody he can,

916
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.120
I know you're coming in for two days.

917
00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:57.900
<v 0>Willie Horton,
that was the guy's name downtown Willie Horton.</v>

918
00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:03.750
I think that was his name.
Wait a minute.
Murderer.
Yeah,

919
00:51:03.751 --> 00:51:08.320
it was a huge,
a huge scandal.
Right.
Cause he,

920
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:12.300
he killed somebody on a,
on a furlough.
That's what it was.
What's his name?

921
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.040
Willie Horton.
It is while you're working.
Yeah.

922
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:16.101
<v 4>And that's,</v>

923
00:51:16.101 --> 00:51:19.160
that brought when they get out and they got some chick that's feeding them and

924
00:51:19.161 --> 00:51:20.320
sending them money.
Every boat.

925
00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:24.700
<v 0>The other thing with Dukakis,
his wife starts tracking paint.
Remember that Shit.</v>

926
00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:29.410
Do you remember that shit?
His wife went crazy.
Was she was drinking everything.

927
00:51:29.411 --> 00:51:30.590
She was drinking like a,

928
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.250
like antifreeze and like fucking deodorant.
She was,
she was doing,

929
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:38.110
I was just drinking Cologne.
What was she drinking?

930
00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.600
That's like a paint thinner or some shit.
She,
uh,
she,
she,

931
00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.580
what was that disease called?
That's xor like no,
no,
no.

932
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:46.150
That's not what it was though.
It was her,

933
00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:48.670
she was an alcoholic and she was trying to,

934
00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.330
she was trying to brake clean and she couldn't do it and so she was trying to

935
00:51:52.331 --> 00:51:54.880
take anything.
That thing where you need paint,

936
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:59.000
like lead attraction to lead,
that's not what it is.
This was a,

937
00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:04.570
uh,
an alcoholism thing.
Can you do caucus?
I know the homeless people in Columbus,

938
00:52:04.571 --> 00:52:08.770
Ohio used to always drink alcohol,
like rubbing alcohol.
That was their thing.

939
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:12.760
Yeah.
Well,
that's what this,
that's what she drank.
Kitty Dukakis drank that stuff.

940
00:52:12.761 --> 00:52:15.820
To me.
That was a huge disaster.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.

941
00:52:15.821 --> 00:52:18.160
She had a huge battle with alcoholism apparently.

942
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.910
I don't know.
I'm fucking paint finish.
She's 30.
She's 77 years old.

943
00:52:24.911 --> 00:52:28.960
She's still alive.
Oh my goodness.
Keep on rocking in the free world.
Well,

944
00:52:28.961 --> 00:52:29.330
the problem,

945
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:32.260
the stress was off her after her husband disappeared from the limelight.

946
00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:36.220
Like being in the limelight is like that.
We're trying to become the president.

947
00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:40.330
Oh my God.
What a fucking crazy way to live your life.

948
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:44.410
<v 4>No,
but every four years it's lightened up.
[inaudible] like now it's impossible.</v>

949
00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:49.460
Like now you have no social life with the cameras and the iPhones and they're,

950
00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:52.510
you know,
it's crazy.
Years ago you'd get away with little things as a present.

951
00:52:52.511 --> 00:52:57.400
Now they have you on every fucking level,
every step you're responsible.
You know,

952
00:52:57.401 --> 00:52:59.820
every word you say is on the Internet.
You know,

953
00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:03.610
the next morning after a state of address,
whatever,
they got you on every level.

954
00:53:03.611 --> 00:53:05.450
It's got to be,
that's the hardest job in the world.

955
00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:09.790
That and being a professional athlete in New York City.
Yeah,
yeah.
No kidding.

956
00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:14.790
<v 0>Right.
In New York City's brutal people fucking tore your world dog.
They will.</v>

957
00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:17.920
You have one bad game they will fucking tore mentioned.

958
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:21.850
They'll turn on you and they feel justified because they know how hard they work

959
00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:25.210
and they know how much you make and they're like,
fuck cam.

960
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:29.640
<v 4>They get rid of people.
I mean,
you know what?</v>

961
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:33.690
The teams don't get rid of people in New York.
The media does basically.
Really?

962
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.750
Yeah.
Look what happened to Mark Sanchez from the jets.
What happened?

963
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.480
The media fucking got,
you know,
it was to overpower him.

964
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.880
Look at t t boat doing blow in Miami last week and this isn't shit.

965
00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:46.080
Then they get in trouble for doing blah.
I don't know.
But look,
you know,
the,
the,

966
00:53:46.081 --> 00:53:47.760
the,
he was a quarterback in New York.

967
00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:52.470
The media fucking get you out before and it ain't even make a decision.

968
00:53:52.471 --> 00:53:55.320
They have to listen to the media.
So overwhelming.
That's interesting.

969
00:53:55.321 --> 00:53:59.490
And especially like a really vocal town like New York,
like they are really,

970
00:53:59.491 --> 00:54:02.670
really low scores.
You're very aggressive.

971
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:08.790
Brutal.
Yankee's Yankee Games are fucking brutal.
Yeah,

972
00:54:08.791 --> 00:54:11.340
they love it.
We never talked about fucking his gummy bears,

973
00:54:11.341 --> 00:54:15.750
those testosterone gummy bears.
He was popping gummy bears.
Fucking hayride.

974
00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:19.260
You didn't read about that.
He was taking testosterone,
gummy bears.
Gummy bears,

975
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:24.090
like in the first inning.
So He'd be on fire by the seventh inning,
Bro.
You don't,

976
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:28.770
you didn't watch 60 minutes now come on.
I thought you knew about this.

977
00:54:28.771 --> 00:54:31.560
I don't know.
It was kicking shit up to a different level.

978
00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:34.620
Gummy bears because I guess they piss you after the show.

979
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:38.880
They'd piss you like the UFC after the fight that after every game they despots

980
00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.520
they piss test,
right.
And B.
How would he get away with it then?

981
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:44.850
I guess the level of go away was just,
it would just spurt,

982
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.710
but you got to read all this.
You gotta let me know.

983
00:54:46.711 --> 00:54:49.130
You've got to fill me in on all this shit.
They would have to,
you'd have to,

984
00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:53.100
he's faked it and it's all hearsay.
I mean,
the guy never got caught.

985
00:54:53.101 --> 00:54:57.060
They offered him 50,000 to disappear.
I mean,
it's all fucking,
he'll say no,

986
00:54:57.061 --> 00:54:58.620
I don't even know what's really going on.

987
00:54:58.621 --> 00:55:02.700
I know the other guy tried to retire yesterday,
but I know a rod is coming back.

988
00:55:02.701 --> 00:55:04.770
He ain't coming back bro.
They just fucking hate him.

989
00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:06.560
<v 0>Why?
What do you,
who's the other guy?
What did,</v>

990
00:55:06.561 --> 00:55:09.920
what is either GE or GE or GE or retiring?
You think they're related though?

991
00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:13.750
Like he just knows that they can't take stuff to the Isas take anymore.
It did.

992
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:14.970
That's definitely happening.
Right.

993
00:55:14.971 --> 00:55:17.580
And a lot of guys getting popped where they used to be able to protect

994
00:55:17.581 --> 00:55:21.870
themselves and then guys like Maguire and you know guys who kind of came out

995
00:55:21.871 --> 00:55:26.370
about it now it's like it sort of revealing the whole undercurrent.

996
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:30.490
<v 4>Well why was cool that motherfucker knew that he was on,
he pulled the Joey Diaz,</v>

997
00:55:30.491 --> 00:55:34.360
he disappeared.
He fucking came back looking like,
you know,
he just disappeared.

998
00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.820
Yeah.
Nine years.
He just,
he knew,
he didn't know.
He just does a fucking pen.

999
00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:42.920
<v 0>He came back and he was like my size normal person.
Oh yeah.</v>

1000
00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:45.290
Hey,
it looks like a guy that works out.
But I mean,

1001
00:55:45.291 --> 00:55:49.100
you remember what would a gorilla he used to look like?
Oh my God,

1002
00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:53.870
they had these forearms.
He's Popeye forums about like a fucking,

1003
00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:56.350
like a horse's leg on the,
on the,

1004
00:55:56.351 --> 00:56:00.650
the meat of their forearm just as manly.
Remember Steve Garvey?

1005
00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:05.870
That motherfucker had the most ridiculous for,
I remember when we were like,

1006
00:56:05.871 --> 00:56:07.820
when I first started lifting weights,
when I was in wrestling,

1007
00:56:07.821 --> 00:56:11.630
people would talk about Steve Garvey's forearms and we would do like these

1008
00:56:11.631 --> 00:56:14.680
little right wrist curl things with the string.

1009
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:17.540
We attached the weight to it and you'd do it like that and it burns out your,

1010
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:18.950
and we will like Steve Garvey,

1011
00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:22.670
Steve Garvey get forums like Steve Garvey because he had these like,

1012
00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:27.520
they were ridiculous.
They were Popeye forearms.
Did they have pictures of it?

1013
00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:32.840
Yeah,
pull up Steve Garvey's forearms.
Take a picture of this shit.
He does.

1014
00:56:32.841 --> 00:56:36.820
It's like some guys like known for their,
their body parts and some weird way.

1015
00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:40.960
But Garvey was one of them and he's like all American man guy looked like he

1016
00:56:40.961 --> 00:56:44.650
belonged in a fucking GI.
Joe Comic book was sturdy eyebrows.

1017
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:48.160
What's matter?
And he's looking very good.
One that has a good,

1018
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:52.570
they don't really have this pop iron ones.
Did they show us forms in any of them?

1019
00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:56.770
What were you in and on about?
Do you see anything?
Oh yeah,

1020
00:56:56.771 --> 00:56:59.800
he was joking on talk charcoal on tech.

1021
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:06.220
They uh,
when they started,
did you Google his forearms?

1022
00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:07.810
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1023
00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:08.680
<v 0>Why don't you try that?</v>

1024
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:14.530
Why the fuck would you go go that bro.
You suck at Google.

1025
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:20.030
All right.
Whatever.
I forgot it.
Unless you could find it.

1026
00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:25.250
That mother fucker had some big ass risks and he would hold that fuck the bat.

1027
00:57:25.251 --> 00:57:27.110
And his forearms are just ginormous.

1028
00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:31.640
Whose there's one picture on a page that looks like him without a helmet on,

1029
00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:35.780
which was usually,
yeah,
that's him in a charity game or something.

1030
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:39.760
Either way.
You know the guy from the fucking Yankees,

1031
00:57:39.761 --> 00:57:41.780
the Yankees had this Japanese plant,
not itchy.

1032
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:45.810
Rosa Zukie the one they had before him dog.

1033
00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:49.540
You could see that motherfucker's quadriceps to his pants.
Oh,

1034
00:57:49.541 --> 00:57:51.850
I bet that I used to look and go,

1035
00:57:51.851 --> 00:57:56.851
what the fuck is that like tool like an upside down via an upside.

1036
00:57:57.701 --> 00:58:01.330
Down v would be coming right down the front of his fucking legs.
You're like,

1037
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:05.380
God damn pictures it.
Shit.
It's a fairly decent picture.

1038
00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:08.410
But you'd really have to see him swinging a bat to realize how fucking

1039
00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:11.980
ridiculously strong it's forearms were pretty decent though.

1040
00:58:11.981 --> 00:58:14.560
You could say though,
if the end,
it wasn't like bodybuilder muscle.
Yeah,

1041
00:58:14.561 --> 00:58:19.360
like hairy arms and shit.
He was a man,
you know?
It wasn't all shaved down lean.

1042
00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:23.940
He probably drank beer every night.
It just fucking,
it just had man strength.
Oh,

1043
00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:27.910
just crack you at that bat.
Woe.
Him and Tommy.
Oh,
sorry.
I can't,

1044
00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.540
yeah,
and Frankie's your beautiful hair too,
guys.

1045
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:36.280
A man manned manly man.
Um,

1046
00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:38.800
how did we get on the subject of giant forums?

1047
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:43.480
We're talking about someone with some,
yeah,
so the gummy bears,

1048
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:46.750
he would take these fucking things like in the first inning,
in the first inning,

1049
00:58:46.751 --> 00:58:49.690
and the human would've had a rubber deck to guy when he would text the guys.

1050
00:58:49.691 --> 00:58:51.490
And the guys would text him back to the doctor,

1051
00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:53.590
he would say is now the right time.

1052
00:58:53.591 --> 00:58:58.520
The guy would text them back yet and he would fucking pop.
Oh,
I read about that.

1053
00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:02.260
So with that would mean is was time released.
Let's find out.

1054
00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:05.200
Find out what he did.
The fucking tremendous fucking tremendous door.

1055
00:59:05.201 --> 00:59:08.530
I thought you'd know all about it.
After you take system

1056
00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:13.230
with a rod gummy bears and see what comes up.

1057
00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:18.710
Took ped gummies and dug out.
There you go.
Hey,

1058
00:59:18.711 --> 00:59:22.750
Ron took p e d dummies gummies.
Wow.

1059
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:27.820
Does your article is revealed by a Dr [inaudible] done a doctor did it.

1060
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:33.890
Damn.
A doctor ratted them out.
So sad.

1061
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:37.270
But he would admitted it.
He admitted it.
Right?

1062
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:40.310
<v 4>This is what I think you want me to tell you what I think,
Bro?
Look,</v>

1063
00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.910
where's this gummy bears?
When when people,

1064
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.760
I think the Yankees have to pay him a lot of money.

1065
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.550
I think they don't want to pay him.
So I think a lot of this,

1066
00:59:49.551 --> 00:59:53.360
they went after this doctor gave him some money to tell the child because

1067
00:59:53.361 --> 00:59:54.410
everybody else got in trouble.

1068
00:59:54.411 --> 00:59:56.780
They suspended this guy for a fucking long ass time.

1069
00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.370
You don't like when people want somebody to stop doing something like John
Gotti,

1070
01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.300
the feds were going to do whatever they willing to do to get John Gotti and

1071
01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:09.590
throw him in fucking jail.
It didn't matter what they had to do.
Lie on the stand.

1072
01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.900
They didn't give a fuck.
This is the same thing they're doing with this guy.

1073
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:13.760
<v 0>What does it say that Brian,</v>

1074
01:00:13.761 --> 01:00:17.180
does it say anything about how long I'm looking for how long it takes for a
test.

1075
01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:18.014
Positive.

1076
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:21.680
So you just see if you can find that how long it takes because it'll be too

1077
01:00:21.681 --> 01:00:26.030
involved for,
to keep up with podcast and do it.
Um,
so they would take it.

1078
01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.080
I bet that's what it is.

1079
01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:29.660
I bet it takes like eight hours to get into your system or something like that

1080
01:00:29.661 --> 01:00:33.650
where you pee it out probably doesn't quite get into your piss track.

1081
01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.540
What he did after the game,

1082
01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:38.720
<v 4>talked about it on 60 minutes.
What he was doing after the game.</v>

1083
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:40.790
Very interesting shit.

1084
01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.540
Now testosterone gummies to give you search for that.

1085
01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.620
So let's say there's a UFC fight.
He's going to fight on the seven o'clock card.

1086
01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.810
He's the third fight.
Yeah,

1087
01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:55.840
pop the fucking testosterone pill or the Gumi while the fight ahead of him is

1088
01:00:55.931 --> 01:00:56.540
on.

1089
01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:57.770
<v 0>You know what's interesting man?</v>

1090
01:00:57.830 --> 01:01:01.640
The argument against letting them do that is not that good.

1091
01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.540
Like he got guys like Jose Conseco,
he's fine.

1092
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:07.760
He's in his 50s and he looks great.

1093
01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:13.010
Like that guy was the juice monster.
He was the juice monster.

1094
01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.290
I mean,
I know he's only one person.
I know.

1095
01:01:15.291 --> 01:01:17.270
If you want to do a real study of baseball players,

1096
01:01:17.271 --> 01:01:21.590
you have to look at a bunch of them that used and or abuse steroids.
But man,

1097
01:01:21.591 --> 01:01:22.730
I don't know.
I mean,

1098
01:01:22.731 --> 01:01:25.850
what's the worst thing that can happen and is it anything like the worst thing

1099
01:01:25.851 --> 01:01:28.700
that can happen if you play football because that's fucking legal.

1100
01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:31.430
It seems like the worst thing and then happened if you play football is you get

1101
01:01:31.431 --> 01:01:34.520
fucked up.
What's the worst thing that you have?
But if you do MMA,

1102
01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:38.720
obviously I support that.
The worst thing that happened,
you can get fucked up.

1103
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:42.410
What's going on with these baseball players that just get bigger.
These,

1104
01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:46.370
it seems to just get bigger.
Like Mcguire's around.
He's not beggar anymore,

1105
01:01:46.371 --> 01:01:50.270
but he seems fine.
He's coaching baseball.
Sammy Sosa became a white guy.

1106
01:01:50.271 --> 01:01:53.150
I don't know what the fuck happened there.
What happened there?
I don't know.

1107
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.990
Sammy Sosa,
is it like a skin condition that he says this skin condition?

1108
01:01:56.991 --> 01:01:59.520
I don't know.
Maybe.
Maybe bears,

1109
01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:04.900
well my friend who's a doctor told me that there are certain Filipinos that uh,

1110
01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:08.500
he treats,
uh,
not that he treats that uh,

1111
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:13.510
his friend treats or someone he knows treats that take a specific supplement or

1112
01:02:13.551 --> 01:02:18.110
a specific drug that is designed to make your skin paler.

1113
01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:22.300
And it's like a common
thing that they do this here,
let me,
let me,

1114
01:02:22.301 --> 01:02:23.940
if I don't know why I said Filipinos,
we could,

1115
01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:28.530
cause he told me that the people that he knew that I had gotten it done were

1116
01:02:28.531 --> 01:02:29.364
Filipinos.

1117
01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:34.440
It says that these gummies cycle in and out of this system quickly.
Yeah.

1118
01:02:34.441 --> 01:02:39.300
I drug test would have to happen right soon after taking it.
Really?

1119
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:44.340
Yeah.
That seems weird.
That's weird.
You know,

1120
01:02:44.350 --> 01:02:45.780
we evolve every fucking day.

1121
01:02:45.781 --> 01:02:47.730
Why don't we think drugs are going to fucking evolve?

1122
01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:51.660
We evolve every fucking day.
I mean,
they don't even have edibles.

1123
01:02:51.661 --> 01:02:54.330
No more than have capsules now that you'd take,

1124
01:02:54.331 --> 01:02:57.120
that will put you on a different fucking planet if you're on a diet or
something.

1125
01:02:57.121 --> 01:03:01.570
Now you're diabetic and Hollywood and La for fucking ta.

1126
01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.620
It's everything now.
Yeah.
This is,

1127
01:03:04.621 --> 01:03:07.860
let me tell you about this shit that they're doing.
This is freaky man.

1128
01:03:07.861 --> 01:03:11.790
These people taking this shot to lighten their body.

1129
01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:16.290
This is a really fucking interesting man.

1130
01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:19.163
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1131
01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:23.350
<v 0>Yeah.
They take a few shots of this stuff and it starts to,</v>

1132
01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:27.160
this is weird.
They have pictures of people before and after they did it.

1133
01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:31.930
Oh my God.
It's intravenous glutathione injections.

1134
01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:36.500
Aw.
What the hell,
man?

1135
01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:42.200
They gained popularity and us and Philippines in 2007 and came to Pakistan in

1136
01:03:42.201 --> 01:03:47.030
the little over a year and a half ago.
Wow.
The doctor says,

1137
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:52.150
my mission is to help patients battle pigmentation does a bad accident.

1138
01:03:52.971 --> 01:03:57.110
Right.
Is that how someone for Pakistan talks?
Maybe?
Yeah.

1139
01:03:57.111 --> 01:04:01.470
I could get away with it.
A couple shots.
They,
they uh,

1140
01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:05.090
start lightening dark spots start to fade away.
That's interesting.
Well,

1141
01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:07.750
whatever man,
do whatever the fuck you want to do.
What do I care?
What,

1142
01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:12.620
what is your argument then?
You're saying that for us,
for MMA,
well,

1143
01:04:12.621 --> 01:04:13.640
for MMA it's different.

1144
01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.730
This is why it's different for him in May because your main goal is to inflict

1145
01:04:16.731 --> 01:04:20.690
damage on people and if you have an unfair advantage and inflicting damage on

1146
01:04:20.691 --> 01:04:24.140
people and makes you get away with things you probably wouldn't get away with.

1147
01:04:24.141 --> 01:04:29.000
If you're a mere mortal,
mere mortal working with a mere mortals body,
um,

1148
01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.830
there are repercussions to hyper testosterone levels and hyper human growth

1149
01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.290
hormone levels over prolonged periods of time.

1150
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:39.440
But there are also benefits of having high testosterone.

1151
01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:44.030
If you were the type of guy who takes way more than you're supposed to take and

1152
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:46.730
does it all the time,
he wouldn't be able to do it forever.

1153
01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:51.110
But you could conceivably go through a strong camp doing that and you would have

1154
01:04:51.111 --> 01:04:53.510
an advantage.
You would have a physical advantage.

1155
01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.120
It doesn't mean you're going to win the fight because there's still skill and

1156
01:04:56.121 --> 01:04:57.110
technique and we'll,

1157
01:04:57.111 --> 01:05:01.600
and heart and courage is a lot of things that you can't measure and put.
Put a a,

1158
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:03.950
you know you can't quantify them,

1159
01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:08.180
but when you can't quantify is that he take the same person with the same well

1160
01:05:08.181 --> 01:05:11.390
and the same heart,
the same desire,
and you give them steroids,

1161
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:15.320
they become a bad or mother fucker.
It's just that simple.

1162
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:18.010
Your body recovers faster.
When you recovers faster,

1163
01:05:18.011 --> 01:05:19.930
you can train harder and get more work done.

1164
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.940
You can do things that you can't normally do,

1165
01:05:21.941 --> 01:05:26.080
like work three hard times in a day.
You know you could do that.

1166
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:28.960
You mean there's a lot of guys who get through that shit just on sheer force of

1167
01:05:28.961 --> 01:05:30.460
will force their body to respond,

1168
01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:33.490
but there's other guys that get on the gear and they get on the gear and they

1169
01:05:33.491 --> 01:05:36.850
can pop through those fucking three and it's still hard work.
Don't get me wrong,

1170
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:39.520
there's still putting in some fucking massive hours.

1171
01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:40.720
They're still busting their ass.

1172
01:05:40.721 --> 01:05:44.530
They're still exerting a lot of will but they get a little chemical help and

1173
01:05:44.531 --> 01:05:48.220
that chemical health is undeniable and part of the problem with that chemical

1174
01:05:48.221 --> 01:05:53.140
health when it pertains to fighting is that what we like about fighting is not

1175
01:05:53.141 --> 01:05:58.141
just watching an athlete perform what we like is the battle of preparation and

1176
01:05:58.811 --> 01:06:03.811
will and willpower and determination that allowed you to get to be that person

1177
01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:08.320
that standing across the octagon from that other person and knowing in your

1178
01:06:08.321 --> 01:06:11.800
heart of hearts that this is a 50 50 proposition and you're going to throw

1179
01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.680
yourself into the fire and try to smash this motherfucker.

1180
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.700
There's other bad ass motherfucker that's been training just as hard as you,

1181
01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:22.630
perhaps just as long as you just as deadly as you are and you know how fucking

1182
01:06:22.631 --> 01:06:23.464
deadly you are,

1183
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:28.770
but he's juiced to the gills just juiced up here and he's been working out in a

1184
01:06:29.771 --> 01:06:33.280
way that you haven't been able to because he's been putting in extra sessions

1185
01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.180
because he's been repairing his muscle tissue really quickly so he has more

1186
01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:37.571
energy.

1187
01:06:37.571 --> 01:06:41.860
The next day he has more cardio because he's taking EPO and blood thinners and

1188
01:06:41.861 --> 01:06:43.300
all those things at cyclists take,

1189
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:47.470
he has more and more growth hormone is body than a normal person because he's

1190
01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:50.710
injecting it into his body despite the fact that he's only 26 years old.

1191
01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.020
That shit's real.
That's real.

1192
01:06:53.021 --> 01:06:56.740
That's real and it's happening and that's where it becomes a problem because the

1193
01:06:56.741 --> 01:06:58.170
purity of the,

1194
01:06:58.171 --> 01:07:02.770
the competition comes into question when you know that someone's received

1195
01:07:02.771 --> 01:07:06.640
artificial help.
I mean,
the argument is that everybody receives artificial help.

1196
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.110
They,
they're all on it.
They all like to say that people would veto.

1197
01:07:09.111 --> 01:07:11.350
He just said that recently.
Everyone's using during camp.

1198
01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:15.940
He actually said that maybe he's right.
He obviously,
he knows more than I do.

1199
01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:17.830
He's in those camps.
The war,

1200
01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:22.240
the best I do is do a little training occasionally with guys that fight.

1201
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:25.120
I'm not in their camps.
I'm not fucking doing two a days with them.

1202
01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:28.540
If [inaudible] says it,
you got to take that for what it's worth.

1203
01:07:28.541 --> 01:07:30.550
He's a world class fighter.
He's a former champion.

1204
01:07:30.551 --> 01:07:34.150
He's fought all over the world.
If he tells you a lot of guys are using in camp,

1205
01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:37.720
I have to assume he's right about,
let's say I do a camp.

1206
01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:42.520
How long did it's out of my system.
I do a six week camp.
It depends.
I mean,

1207
01:07:42.521 --> 01:07:44.890
I didn't know about these gummy bears as you say.

1208
01:07:44.891 --> 01:07:48.130
I'm gonna say it like that from now on.
Kumi bears.
No,
but this is just,
I don't,

1209
01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.330
I don't even know.
I'm talking about,

1210
01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:54.060
I go to Mike Dolce and I'm going to fight fucking Carlos conduit that first week

1211
01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:59.620
three.
I'm just,
I'm just saying,
I'm just,
I'm a one 70.
I'm a 22 year old guy.

1212
01:07:59.621 --> 01:08:01.630
I'm gonna fight.
Am I got a six week camp?

1213
01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:05.410
When do I start shooting and when do I stop?
That's a real good question.
I mean,

1214
01:08:05.411 --> 01:08:07.870
I don't know if you would need,
if you're 22,
the guys who probably,

1215
01:08:07.871 --> 01:08:10.360
you start using it,
they'd get a little older and they start using it.

1216
01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:11.980
It could fuck you up when you're younger.

1217
01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.950
And it's one of the reasons why some guys have gotten testosterone use

1218
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.630
exemptions,
um,
early in their life.
Like,

1219
01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:21.260
even though they're young twenties because they use steroids and then their

1220
01:08:21.261 --> 01:08:22.640
testosterone shut down,

1221
01:08:22.641 --> 01:08:26.750
the production shut down and so then they might not have even tested positive

1222
01:08:26.751 --> 01:08:27.800
fighting.
You know?

1223
01:08:27.801 --> 01:08:31.700
That's also a possibility for testosterone use exemption that you've always had

1224
01:08:31.701 --> 01:08:33.590
it from the beginning of your martial arts career,

1225
01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:36.680
that you've got a doctor's note before you ever fought.
So you never cheated.

1226
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:39.590
And it could be because you used steroids when you were younger.

1227
01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:41.780
You could have been a bodybuilder or a football player,

1228
01:08:41.781 --> 01:08:45.830
someone who took too much stuff and fucked up their own endocrine system.

1229
01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:47.030
It's super common.

1230
01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:52.130
So for a guy like say Chris Weidman who swears up and down that he never uses

1231
01:08:52.131 --> 01:08:52.521
anything,

1232
01:08:52.521 --> 01:08:54.890
and I believe him and I talked to everybody that he trains with and I believe

1233
01:08:54.891 --> 01:08:56.360
him,
I think he's just a stud athlete.

1234
01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:59.120
For a guy like that who doesn't take anything,

1235
01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:03.950
is it fair for him to fight a guy who's taken something?
I don't know.

1236
01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.440
You know,
I don't know.
It's,
it's an interesting question.

1237
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:10.730
If the doctor say that you could,
you could take these supplements,

1238
01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.490
you can take this testosterone,
you could supplement your testosterone.

1239
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:16.940
If the doctor say it's okay and you,

1240
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:20.030
you allow that in a world title fight.
I almost think,

1241
01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:23.660
I almost think that everybody should be allowed to do it.

1242
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:25.850
Almost think that everybody should be allowed to do it.

1243
01:09:25.851 --> 01:09:29.540
If that's going to happen,
if they're going to continue testosterone replacement,

1244
01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:33.440
I almost feel like it should be up to the fighter and that would be a point of

1245
01:09:33.441 --> 01:09:36.770
discussion when you do the commentary that uh,
you know,

1246
01:09:36.771 --> 01:09:40.970
he's chosen not to use testosterone and he fights with his natural testosterone

1247
01:09:40.971 --> 01:09:42.430
whereas this guy doesn't,

1248
01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.430
that's almost something that we should talk about like as an option because

1249
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.170
people are rigging the system.

1250
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:52.460
You're getting charismatic doctors who talked to athletic commissions and tell

1251
01:09:52.461 --> 01:09:54.200
of a guy who's got a medical problem.

1252
01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.650
But what they leave out is that the guideline,

1253
01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:59.310
I just got off of a six week steroids cycle.
So when they,

1254
01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:03.500
they do a test of his blood after he is clean of all of his steroids,

1255
01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:07.280
his testosterone is low.
It's because he just got off of it.

1256
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:09.260
It's not what a normal man,
normal man,
you know,

1257
01:10:09.261 --> 01:10:14.261
300 500 maybe 800 they know his is like one 60 well why is his one 60 because

1258
01:10:14.901 --> 01:10:18.200
his body's struggling to Regaine testosterone production.

1259
01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:22.640
It's not because he has a sickness that you're addressing with medicine that

1260
01:10:22.641 --> 01:10:24.860
otherwise he wouldn't be healthy and wouldn't be able to do it.
He's,

1261
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:28.640
he's done this to himself and we know they've done this to themselves.

1262
01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:31.460
So that's when it becomes a real issue.
Where it becomes a real issue was you're,

1263
01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:35.510
you're favoring people who have cheated and of course the argument for the

1264
01:10:35.511 --> 01:10:38.480
people that have gotten caught is like Victoria said,
hey man,

1265
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:40.610
everybody's doing this.
They're all using,

1266
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:45.200
I got to go with him because he's the guy that's in the trenches.

1267
01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:47.630
He's the guy that's,
you know,
one of the main guys at the black resilience.

1268
01:10:47.631 --> 01:10:51.320
If he says everybody's using,
who knows what the fuck's going on,
who knows.

1269
01:10:51.321 --> 01:10:54.380
If it's just maybe means a lot of people use when they get injured,

1270
01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:58.490
maybe means a lot of people use when they go to a doctor because they're dealing

1271
01:10:58.491 --> 01:11:01.640
with something specific.
Recovery from surgery,
whatever the fuck it is.

1272
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:04.970
I don't know,
man.
I don't know,
but what does all that,
Brian,

1273
01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:09.420
this is supposedly what Alex Rodriguez is alleged drug rigid.

1274
01:11:09.421 --> 01:11:14.280
Anyone which gludethyon was on that.
What's that mean?
What's a the antioxidant.

1275
01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.530
Hgh.
EHR.
A fire on cream.
Oh Wow.
How weird.

1276
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.420
Well,
listen man,

1277
01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:26.450
think about how much fucking money Alex Rodriguez made.

1278
01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:30.810
Throwing and catching a ball,
hitting the ball.
What did he play?

1279
01:11:30.811 --> 01:11:35.090
What position he play?
Outfield.
Thank you.
Pleased the outfield.
Shortstop.

1280
01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.440
Thinking about how much money that motherfucker,
man,
he was a huge star.

1281
01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:41.310
Huge Star.
Huge dot.
Khan's Amani fucked every bitch.

1282
01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:46.090
Here's the problem with these guys.
This is the only thing I have.
Yeah,

1283
01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:47.670
that that took defend him.

1284
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:51.290
The only thing I have is that they're fucking season as long,
bro.

1285
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:54.780
That's a long that it's hard to do.
That's a long ass season.

1286
01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:58.440
They played two games in a row.
They do double headers.
Yeah,
that's what I mean.

1287
01:11:58.441 --> 01:12:01.170
Four or five in a year maybe.
I don't know what to.
So how do they do that?

1288
01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:03.790
They start at noon or something like that.
They start at noon,
but that's not it.

1289
01:12:03.791 --> 01:12:05.190
I'm talking about they start and fucking,

1290
01:12:05.191 --> 01:12:09.540
they started playing baseball at the end of January and they go through October.

1291
01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:10.171
Yeah,

1292
01:12:10.171 --> 01:12:13.200
there's already training camp that's there and I was on it right now throwing a

1293
01:12:13.201 --> 01:12:16.190
ball around.
It's mid February.
So a lot of money,
man.
But hey mom,

1294
01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:19.380
it's a great job.
It's a great job.
The safe.

1295
01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:24.450
Then it's a long fucking seasons.
17 weeks.
Every fucking week.

1296
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:26.670
You have one day off arrest after Sunday.

1297
01:12:26.671 --> 01:12:29.460
You know Sunday's like you don't want to know what you wake up feeling like I'm

1298
01:12:29.461 --> 01:12:33.740
Monday.
Oh yeah,
I can imagine.
You could only a manager,
a linebacker.

1299
01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.940
You feel like a fucking truck hit you.
That's what's been hit.

1300
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.610
You gotta hit 18 times by your fucking truck.

1301
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.940
I remember when I was on the wrestling team,
Sophomore Year of high school,

1302
01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:44.700
I never worked harder at anything in my entire fucking life.

1303
01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:48.750
I couldn't believe how sore I was just walking home every day,
you know,

1304
01:12:48.751 --> 01:12:52.950
we were carrying kids up fucking stairs and doing crazy drills and a lot of,

1305
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:56.460
a lot of fireman's carries carrying people around the the wrestling room,

1306
01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:00.310
lot of fucking drills,
a lot of wrestling and then running all,

1307
01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:01.340
I mean it was unbelievable.

1308
01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:05.160
I went from no working out at all to like this unbelievable workout schedule.

1309
01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:09.420
I mean I think I'd done karate a little bit,
but it was bad.

1310
01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:12.210
It's barely a workout compare to this wrestling practice.

1311
01:13:12.211 --> 01:13:15.360
It was like barely nothing.
No.
Everybody line up,

1312
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:20.390
so I kicked their rent is 100 degrees for the room.

1313
01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:24.330
You're rent is a hundred degrees.
Then you got to run stairs.

1314
01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:28.800
I used to play football and watch them practicing and I would die and I'd be

1315
01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:31.350
running sprints were like of equipment on and you're like,
I'm dying.

1316
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:34.860
And you look over at them and they were on the third floor running fucking 80

1317
01:13:34.861 --> 01:13:38.340
times up and down and you're like,
God,
no.
Better conditioned athletes.

1318
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:42.090
Then wrestlers and then after wrestlers,
mixed martial arts fighters,

1319
01:13:42.091 --> 01:13:44.970
mixed martial arts Fridays maybe even over wrestlers because they have more

1320
01:13:44.971 --> 01:13:47.430
things to do.
You know they're think about striking.

1321
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:50.520
You gotta think about submissions but wrestlers set the pace.

1322
01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:53.700
The one of the reasons why it mixed martial arts fighters fight and compete at

1323
01:13:53.701 --> 01:13:57.360
such a high level is because the example shown by like real high level
wrestlers,

1324
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:59.730
they just take conditioning to this whole new place.

1325
01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:03.210
And then I think honestly if I really be honest about it,

1326
01:14:03.211 --> 01:14:06.580
I think that the elite MMA players take it to another place in Thailand.

1327
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.670
They take it to one more place cause they involve striking.

1328
01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:11.040
I got to tell you something,
but I've never looked at the clock and said,

1329
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:12.040
I wish I could

1330
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.550
<v 4>live my life again.
But if I was 25 again,
I'd be Joe Lozano.</v>

1331
01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:19.990
I wouldn't want to fight in the gym.
I would just want to do Jujitsu.

1332
01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:24.340
It's so fucking interesting.
What an interesting fight in the UFC.

1333
01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:28.390
Tournament's everyone should,
we want you to do it now.

1334
01:14:28.391 --> 01:14:30.920
If it's changed your life now is that which just one years old man?

1335
01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:34.690
You said it's changed your life now.
I love it.
I just think it's,

1336
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:38.800
I love getting beat up.
I think that when you just prepares me for everything.

1337
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:42.220
When I got to see for me Jujitsu some completely different than what it is for

1338
01:14:42.221 --> 01:14:45.340
somebody at 20.
You know,
they want to go to competitions and shifted me.

1339
01:14:45.341 --> 01:14:49.000
It's just getting healthy.
For me,
it's like a,
a goal.
Like when I first went,

1340
01:14:49.001 --> 01:14:52.660
I could do three hip escapes now I could do the whole floor and back and I got a

1341
01:14:52.661 --> 01:14:55.990
style,
you know,
I could do,
I can't still do any judo roles.

1342
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:58.600
I mean that's great though.
Hip escape all the way up and back,

1343
01:14:58.601 --> 01:15:01.840
back and then the other one and then the one where your hip escape and pull your

1344
01:15:01.841 --> 01:15:05.430
leg back and flip around that time broke my toe and uh,
you know,

1345
01:15:05.431 --> 01:15:09.160
I'm learning all this shit that I've always loved Joe Lowe's on.

1346
01:15:09.161 --> 01:15:12.370
I've always loved the Jujitsu guys.
I Love Daddy.
I love Marcello.

1347
01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:17.560
I love [inaudible].
I love Jujitsu.
I love Jujitsu.
Once you grow a punch.

1348
01:15:17.561 --> 01:15:21.730
Gads fun.
A kick to the head is fun,
but the all,
when you see a really,

1349
01:15:21.731 --> 01:15:26.440
really good Jujitsu,
like I don't watch no shit on Youtube.
I watch videos,

1350
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:30.490
music videos,
and I watched Jujitsu on Youtube.
Look at Eddie Bravo.

1351
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:34.780
I'll place one 63 the kids rip.
No,
he's really working hard,
man.

1352
01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:39.620
He did three workouts last Wednesday.
He goes to John Jackson,
dedicated as fun.

1353
01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.660
My friends call me from John Jack and they're like,
you should.

1354
01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:44.590
It's already tonight,
Bro.
Yeah,
he's dead.
Like John.

1355
01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:48.210
John teaches a class and he's got Eddie on the side,
so he rolls.

1356
01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:49.390
Then he got Eddie on this side.

1357
01:15:49.391 --> 01:15:51.760
They say it's pretty fucking interesting to watch.
That's awesome.

1358
01:15:51.761 --> 01:15:55.450
I can't go to the fight.
I'm the Florida that week.
Oh yeah.
No Way.

1359
01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:56.733
I'm going to call me.

1360
01:15:57.310 --> 01:16:01.090
I can't do they sell tickets with that squad baby?

1361
01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:06.400
Damn.
Yeah,
it's Fort Lauderdale and I can't get to him.

1362
01:16:06.401 --> 01:16:09.370
I want you to be there for them.
He to,
he wanted me to.
I told him no,

1363
01:16:09.371 --> 01:16:11.800
I wouldn't walk down the thing with him.
He goes,
why not?

1364
01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.920
I don't remember fucking,
uh,

1365
01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:18.010
when Kay James walked down fucking whatever I walk in,

1366
01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:21.720
nobody said that ain't no fighter.
What you're looking at me like that,

1367
01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:25.900
you know what I'm saying?
So why you your friend,
you my bride energy.

1368
01:16:25.930 --> 01:16:30.670
But I swear to God I would love to be 25 just to start Jujitsu just so I could

1369
01:16:30.671 --> 01:16:33.790
just the camaraderie I said gotten.
How long have you been doing it now?

1370
01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:37.080
Since May.
I'm terrible.
Has it gotten you in better shape though?
Yeah.

1371
01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:41.800
Oh fuck yeah.
No gas out after like the second sparring session.

1372
01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:45.100
I've got stop the third minute,
but drug,
when I went,

1373
01:16:45.101 --> 01:16:48.580
I was gassing up the first one.
I hold my breath,
you know,
and I think,
um,

1374
01:16:50.210 --> 01:16:55.180
you know,
you hold your breath when you think I go Tuesdays I go to kettle bells.

1375
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:58.300
Like these three weeks I've been off.
So I go to kettlebells Monday,

1376
01:16:58.301 --> 01:17:01.360
Wednesdays and Friday mornings.
Then I go to Jujitsu Tuesdays.

1377
01:17:01.361 --> 01:17:04.380
I couldn't go today cause I had to come here at three but I'll go tomorrow night

1378
01:17:04.381 --> 01:17:07.090
I,
it'd be going to class and then I'll do Marcello madness a little bit.

1379
01:17:07.091 --> 01:17:09.070
And that's fucking brutal.
What's Marcella?

1380
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.050
<v 0>50 burpees in between everything else he teaches you.
So Am I.
50 burpees,
walk,</v>

1381
01:17:15.051 --> 01:17:20.030
lunges,
50 burpees,
25 push ups,
50 burpees.
I can't do that work.
That's a lot.

1382
01:17:20.031 --> 01:17:23.400
I can't do a bourbon.
I can't do a bourbon.
Why so many burpees?
Because he want,

1383
01:17:23.401 --> 01:17:24.980
he's John Job there.
He's Brazilian.

1384
01:17:24.981 --> 01:17:28.490
He wants you to be really tired by the time we choose the technique.

1385
01:17:28.491 --> 01:17:29.750
And then you roll later on.

1386
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:33.830
Well they say that the best way to really a figuring out how to fight when

1387
01:17:33.831 --> 01:17:35.540
you're tired is to fight when you're tired all the time.

1388
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:39.740
Just do it in the gym so that you use technique and you don't use strength.

1389
01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:43.030
Now that's the idea behind it.
But the,
the,

1390
01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:46.820
the problem with that is I think that's real good mentally and psychologically.

1391
01:17:46.821 --> 01:17:50.240
I think that's real good.
But skill learning,
you learn skills best,

1392
01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:52.690
you get the SH,
the sharper 10,
you're not telling,
you're not tired.

1393
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.920
So I think that it's probably a super important aspect to tea to training,

1394
01:17:58.190 --> 01:18:01.760
but the best way to do it,
it's almost definitely go through drills first.

1395
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:05.840
I'm going to Reagan's most people.
I hear you man.
The 23rd I'm going to Higgins.

1396
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:08.100
Yeah.
Are you?
Yeah,
I'm going to this workshop.
I love he again.

1397
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:12.750
What's a Sunday and when is it?
What day?
The 23rd of this month.
Yeah.

1398
01:18:12.810 --> 01:18:17.330
You'll be coming back from Vegas.
Ah,
1230 down in and not Beverly hills,

1399
01:18:17.331 --> 01:18:21.650
but the other school and a off the ocean.
I Love Hagen.
I've never met him,

1400
01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.800
but I can say he's a really good time for him and Abu Dhabi when he's fighting.

1401
01:18:24.801 --> 01:18:29.760
And I will dive in 2003.
Yeah.
And uh,
I was,
uh,
I was there and he would,
uh,

1402
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:32.900
call out to me like,
because he was out of shape.
It was just,
uh,

1403
01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:34.130
he hadn't trained at all.
He just,

1404
01:18:34.131 --> 01:18:36.700
he was so good that he could just like show up and,

1405
01:18:36.701 --> 01:18:39.260
and just start rolling with like the best guys in the world and heavyweight

1406
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:43.670
divisions.
I mean,
he get,
it's just such a beast.
He's so technical and he's,
he's,

1407
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:45.380
he's as old school as you get.

1408
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:49.520
There's a great old video of he gun rolling with Hixon Gracie and uh,

1409
01:18:49.521 --> 01:18:51.430
it's like when they were both young and it's,
it's a,

1410
01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.750
it's a crazy video and the Hickson was older than Hagen,

1411
01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:57.690
but he can was like the dangerous up and coming cat and uh,
you know,

1412
01:18:57.710 --> 01:19:00.530
he would call up and he'd look at me and I have to yell out like three minutes

1413
01:19:00.531 --> 01:19:05.180
left,
one minute left too.
He's a big guy,
right?

1414
01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.340
He's big now.
He was like,

1415
01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:12.650
pull up a Hixon Gracie versus r I.
G.
A.
N Machado.

1416
01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:17.630
There's a video.
It's kind of cool to watch because,
um,
this video is a,

1417
01:19:17.631 --> 01:19:20.420
you know,
Hickson was a r r.
I.
C.
K.
Um,

1418
01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:23.000
this video is from like the early days,

1419
01:19:23.001 --> 01:19:26.570
like the 1980s or some shit when they were both young and Brazil.

1420
01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.910
And they're both,
you know,
they're growing up.

1421
01:19:28.911 --> 01:19:31.040
Most people in the world don't even know what you did too.

1422
01:19:31.041 --> 01:19:36.041
Is most of the world has no idea that Brazilian jujitsu exist and down there and

1423
01:19:36.261 --> 01:19:41.261
Rio are these two super alpha predators going after each other in this

1424
01:19:41.601 --> 01:19:44.690
incredible high level Jujitsu match.
It's submission match.

1425
01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:48.770
This is them going at it here.
I mean this is some old shit.

1426
01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:53.170
What's going on?
The laptop?
Is that the laptop?
Yeah.

1427
01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:58.580
Um,
these guys,
if,
if you know,

1428
01:19:58.581 --> 01:19:59.870
if you watched this,
I'm,

1429
01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:04.280
this is like some real high level Jujitsu still to this day.
This is like,

1430
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:08.160
you could see these guys rolling like with this technique that they're

1431
01:20:08.161 --> 01:20:10.410
exhibiting right here.
You can see these guys rolling like this.

1432
01:20:10.411 --> 01:20:12.570
And then when the owls,
I mean these are elite,
elite,

1433
01:20:12.571 --> 01:20:16.080
elite grapplers and this is back before anybody knew about it.

1434
01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:21.570
What year is this Brian?
Say here.
I'll pull it up.
Hold on.
Say previous yard.

1435
01:20:23.970 --> 01:20:28.050
No,
it's not.
Yeah.
What's the gross music behind it?

1436
01:20:28.650 --> 01:20:30.020
Who did that?
You fuckhead?

1437
01:20:31.170 --> 01:20:32.003
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1438
01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:36.410
<v 0>19.
Okay.
Well yeah,
that's hard to tell.</v>

1439
01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:40.880
I'm trying to find it.
It's a,
it's incredible.
Then when you watch that video,

1440
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:45.110
it's um,
does it say here?
No,
it doesn't say.

1441
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:48.950
I think if I had a gas,
I think it was probably the late eighties,

1442
01:20:50.370 --> 01:20:54.990
but I'm not sure.
But a Hixon got them eventually,

1443
01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:57.930
eventually he got him.

1444
01:20:58.170 --> 01:21:01.610
He could not handle the pace for Hickson's the greatest of all time.
Yeah.

1445
01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:07.650
I don't know if fix it tapped him.
I think he did.
Um,
but uh,

1446
01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:12.400
Hixon is a,
it says the only person,
oh,

1447
01:21:12.401 --> 01:21:16.160
Ron trip is the only person credited.
Oh,

1448
01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:18.400
with the a a victory over Hixon Gracie.

1449
01:21:18.401 --> 01:21:21.520
But that's just ridiculous because he beat him in judo and all he did was take

1450
01:21:21.521 --> 01:21:25.120
him down,
he knee pond them or [inaudible] pond them,
whatever it is.

1451
01:21:25.121 --> 01:21:29.470
When someone throws you like a serious throw,
like the,
the match is over.

1452
01:21:29.471 --> 01:21:30.490
But Hickson was fine.

1453
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:33.640
Like Hicks wanted to fight to go to the ground so he could submit them.

1454
01:21:33.730 --> 01:21:38.620
So when they say you credit a guy with a victory in a match like that,
like,
yeah,

1455
01:21:38.621 --> 01:21:42.610
I guess so.
But it's by judo rules.
It's not not what Hickson's doing.

1456
01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:46.420
If Hickson and Ron trip were to roll and rancher beat them,

1457
01:21:46.421 --> 01:21:49.280
that would be a different thing.
If they were to spar or you know,

1458
01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:53.680
have a Jujitsu competition of just an all out grappling competition to

1459
01:21:53.681 --> 01:21:58.660
submission.
I got my money on the Brazilian son.
What a great sport.

1460
01:21:58.870 --> 01:22:01.330
Yeah,
it's an awesome,
can't wait to get back man.

1461
01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.010
My back is pretty much a hundred percent now

1462
01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:06.950
<v 4>and the kids I go with the half my age bro,
you know,
and it's just fun.</v>

1463
01:22:06.951 --> 01:22:10.820
The goal and they know who you are.
They asked me,
they listened to the podcast,

1464
01:22:10.821 --> 01:22:14.870
they want to come watch me perform.
They came to the ice house,
you know,

1465
01:22:14.871 --> 01:22:18.500
they really fucking good kids.
And my problem is that I come back on Sundays,

1466
01:22:18.501 --> 01:22:21.890
they all go to contest.
I love to go see him and support him.
You know,

1467
01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:26.000
like they went to the,
to the Gracies.
Uh,
two of them went to the Nogi part,

1468
01:22:26.001 --> 01:22:30.510
but I'm going to be in San Jose for the World Gracie's July 13th.
Oh,

1469
01:22:30.511 --> 01:22:34.610
real weekend yet.
I'll stop down by my man,
Dave,
Kevin,
Maria,

1470
01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:39.290
another one that my Jujitsu idols,
and then I'd go to the,
to the worlds,
you know,

1471
01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:43.490
go watch them and see what it's about.
Lie.
No,
it's really interesting.

1472
01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:45.950
I never really watched it.
I'm only went to one match.

1473
01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.010
<v 0>You got to come to some of the,
uh,
some of the UFC is,</v>

1474
01:22:49.011 --> 01:22:50.160
we haven't seen you in awhile.
I'm

1475
01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:53.010
<v 4>coming.
I'm going to a lunch when you come in.
I'm Alando Orlando,</v>

1476
01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:58.280
Sarah in Baltimore and Baltimore.
John Jones.
John over to share.
But I'm,

1477
01:22:58.281 --> 01:23:01.470
I'm really excited about Misha Tate and a car MOOC.

1478
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:06.030
That's going to be a fucking barnyard fucking tool.
Gorillas fighting.

1479
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.500
<v 5>It's amazing.
Where listen in a cup and a year,</v>

1480
01:23:08.501 --> 01:23:10.570
they won't even need those fucking Ringrose no more.

1481
01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.920
Unless those bitches could rappel.
Rappel.

1482
01:23:13.330 --> 01:23:16.180
We don't need to walking around with some fucking sign that says number three,

1483
01:23:16.181 --> 01:23:19.370
go fuck yourself.
We got bitches pulling each other's heads now.

1484
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:23.140
Each in the fucking face.
Why don't they have ring guys?

1485
01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:27.160
I think that the girls should have ring guys.
That's what I think,
man.
I mean,

1486
01:23:27.161 --> 01:23:30.580
if we're not going to be sexist,
if we're not going to be sexist and you know,

1487
01:23:30.581 --> 01:23:35.260
Miesha Tate and Ronda Rousey,
maybe you,
that's what I was thinking.

1488
01:23:35.261 --> 01:23:38.020
Come on.
Maybe you would have speedo going like,
come on.

1489
01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:41.960
You know how awesome that would be if you were the ring card girl and a speed a

1490
01:23:41.961 --> 01:23:45.040
boy in a speedo and some,
some shower sandals.

1491
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:47.920
I think we should take with tap out and say that's my boy.

1492
01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:51.820
That's my dog.
Yeah.
You with like a,

1493
01:23:51.821 --> 01:23:56.821
an unharnessed like a pair of boxers on harness boxers.

1494
01:23:56.981 --> 01:24:01.420
Just loose,
just swinging Dick.
You know like the opening scene of uh,

1495
01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:05.650
the um,
Deanna word video where he's flinging his dick up and down.

1496
01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:09.000
I remember that part where he's beat boxing and it's in slow motion.

1497
01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:11.020
He see his dick.
That'd be you.
That'd be you.

1498
01:24:11.021 --> 01:24:12.460
That'd he be you as the ring card girl.

1499
01:24:12.490 --> 01:24:14.050
I don't know if you watch a play that part of the video.

1500
01:24:14.051 --> 01:24:16.090
I don't know if you guys watch a lot of fights afterwards.

1501
01:24:16.091 --> 01:24:20.680
I just rewatched the whole Ronda Rousey Meisha take card and that fight,

1502
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:24.820
you know,
you can type quicker with two hands.
That fight was so fucking good.

1503
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:29.650
That fight was so fucking good to Misha Tate and Ronda Rousey was great.

1504
01:24:29.651 --> 01:24:30.484
Last one,

1505
01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.760
and it was so technical and just to see where women have come and where are they

1506
01:24:33.761 --> 01:24:37.870
going to go now?
Cause the ones and some gym in San Diego with some gym and Iowa,

1507
01:24:37.871 --> 01:24:40.960
the 14 year olds,
they're going to be fucking monsters.
Oh yeah.

1508
01:24:40.961 --> 01:24:44.800
Especially now when they see how famous Ronda Rousey's now these 15 year olds,

1509
01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:48.010
the training that looked like men and they're like that,
that chicken,
uh,

1510
01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:52.290
what was the fat chicken that the baseball movie with Mcdonald will remember?

1511
01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:54.130
Gina Carano the other one,

1512
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:58.660
the other one that the father brother and he was telling Jon Lovitz,
you know,

1513
01:24:58.900 --> 01:24:59.830
she don't look that good.

1514
01:24:59.831 --> 01:25:02.200
And then they brought her out to see John Lovers and John Lewis was like,

1515
01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:05.710
like he was scared of him.
He was like,
you can't take her out in the daytime.

1516
01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:09.520
Like they have those ugly chicks for the train.
He's somewhere right now.

1517
01:25:09.610 --> 01:25:12.880
Oh you're going to be fucking cause see the UFC goes after the hot ones cause

1518
01:25:12.881 --> 01:25:15.850
that's what people pay for.
No,
no.
They go after the best fighters.

1519
01:25:15.851 --> 01:25:19.590
There's a lot of them that aren't hot at all yet.
The Dick swinging.
If I was,

1520
01:25:19.950 --> 01:25:21.880
if I was the one view this is,

1521
01:25:21.881 --> 01:25:26.410
you will just find the part where his,
his dick is flopping around.

1522
01:25:27.010 --> 01:25:30.160
Don't play the music.
Find it.
Just find the part so we could,

1523
01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:34.810
cause I think we'll get in trouble if you play the music.
I don't know if this,

1524
01:25:34.811 --> 01:25:36.970
there it is.
That's you.
Joey looks like Einstein.

1525
01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.740
He looks like Einstein but picture you and some pink Floyd shorts like that.

1526
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:46.540
Carrying the ring card side laying down in Vegas.
Free balling.
Total free ball.

1527
01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:49.090
Unharness cock.
I couldn't do it.
They can deal with it.

1528
01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.910
They would have to add the nut sack.
That's the real wrecking ball.

1529
01:25:51.911 --> 01:25:54.610
That nuts that come in behind you.
That's the real fun.

1530
01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:59.170
That's the real kettle bell.
Got
that.

1531
01:25:59.171 --> 01:26:01.300
Fucking not,
I got this tremendous Doug,

1532
01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:05.990
why don't they have ring car boy on the phone and tell him get some pretty

1533
01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.670
serious.
Is that real quick?

1534
01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:12.590
Because the audience is 100% guys almost and then no one wants to see a dude

1535
01:26:12.591 --> 01:26:13.830
walking around.
That's the whole life.

1536
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:18.970
The showmanship of boxing and I bet the audience has a,

1537
01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.600
a an equal proportion it women fighting on the card ratio to women being in the

1538
01:26:26.811 --> 01:26:27.080
audience.

1539
01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:31.520
<v 0>It's ratio.
It probably more stronger to women in the audience ratio.</v>

1540
01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:34.690
So if you got a card and does nine fights in the card and one of those fights is

1541
01:26:34.691 --> 01:26:35.510
a girl fight,

1542
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:38.780
the next one in February of two of those fights are at girl fight to have those

1543
01:26:38.781 --> 01:26:39.710
fights are girl fight.

1544
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:43.010
If there's 20% of the audience that are there that are girls,

1545
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:46.130
I say least one ring card boy.
Good.

1546
01:26:46.230 --> 01:26:46.610
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1547
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:51.570
Chuck Congo with that big show with a song up there shaking that big yoke and

1548
01:26:51.571 --> 01:26:54.530
shit.
It's all over like a route,

1549
01:26:54.531 --> 01:26:58.680
like a root of an ebony chain or reassign that motherfucker be a ring guy just

1550
01:26:58.681 --> 01:26:59.970
bursting through the concrete.

1551
01:26:59.971 --> 01:27:04.230
That's what they want to see the size of Congo's copper cause fucking hitting my

1552
01:27:04.231 --> 01:27:06.330
Goldberg in the head as he runs by and shit.

1553
01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:09.330
It's like one of those routes in an old neighborhood that pushes up the sidewalk

1554
01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:12.390
at the time.
I look at Chuck Congo,
I'm like,
damn,

1555
01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:18.120
I wonder who he fucked in the ass last night.
He came up to me,

1556
01:27:18.121 --> 01:27:20.290
he listened to this talk about his dick on the podcast.

1557
01:27:20.291 --> 01:27:22.770
He did and he came up to be laughing.
He's like,
don't here.

1558
01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:26.700
It's like shopping towards his leg.
Like,

1559
01:27:26.701 --> 01:27:29.430
cause he's the one saves a little bit at the airport.

1560
01:27:29.431 --> 01:27:32.040
One days in a load is a good man.
Check on it.

1561
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:35.810
<v 0>It's a good fire too.
He's fighting.
He's doing well and Beltre just uh,
just one.</v>

1562
01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:40.820
One by Tko.
Good fight too against um,
a former,

1563
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:43.220
like a really good fighter.
What the fuck did he fight?
Actually,

1564
01:27:43.221 --> 01:27:47.900
I think he's fought twice now.
I think.
So let me pull it out.

1565
01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:52.540
But I think I know he fucked Peter Graham proof.
Pretty short.

1566
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:56.780
Fought Peter Graham,
who's a really high level kickboxer and his last,
uh,

1567
01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:00.650
last fight.
Mark.

1568
01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:05.030
Go goober.
Maybe someone else.
Fuck.
Oh yeah,
I did fight Peter Graham.

1569
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:06.643
Yeah.

1570
01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:13.190
Congo versus Kurose Congo.
One by unanimous decision.
That's it.

1571
01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:16.820
That's a pretty impressive win because Peter Grams a serious kickboxer,

1572
01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:21.080
not like the best MMA fighter like Congo has more MMA experience,

1573
01:28:21.081 --> 01:28:23.720
but Peter Grams a motherfucker and kickboxing.
He broke,

1574
01:28:23.721 --> 01:28:25.670
bought her hardest job with a cartwheel kick.

1575
01:28:26.150 --> 01:28:30.650
You ever see a guy threw a cartwheel kick this ridiculous cartwheel.

1576
01:28:30.650 --> 01:28:32.970
Like put your hand on the ground.
We'll kick and he broke,

1577
01:28:32.971 --> 01:28:37.400
bought her Harvey's job.
See if he could find that.
Peter Graham Kaos Badr Hari.

1578
01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:41.070
It's a crazy kick.
Like really bizarre.
Tick.

1579
01:28:41.071 --> 01:28:44.690
Shattered his jaw to knocked him out cold and Him and bought her heart.

1580
01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.460
He got in a fight,
a press conference,

1581
01:28:46.461 --> 01:28:49.040
like fucking full on fist fight at a press conference.

1582
01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.760
Those Dutch dudes are crazy,
man.
They don't give a fuck.

1583
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:56.030
That's about totally different worlds guy behind your dog.
Elvis.

1584
01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:57.070
The best thing that happened,

1585
01:28:57.090 --> 01:29:02.090
this guy was that they took them at 70 1977 cause he wouldn't have made out

1586
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.260
<v 4>of the 80s he would have fucked the 80s up.</v>

1587
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:07.260
He had so much money by the time the eighties where the hit,

1588
01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:10.860
he would have just been taking women up their spot and below and shooting them.

1589
01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:14.610
He don't get him that Memphis Mafia.
They didn't give a fuck.

1590
01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:16.830
If you really read about Elvis,

1591
01:29:16.831 --> 01:29:21.720
you realize one thing that mother fucker was crazy,
like Sinatra was crazy,

1592
01:29:21.721 --> 01:29:24.240
but this mother fucker was crazy.

1593
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:28.050
I read a chapter in the led Zeppelin book with led Zeppelin went to his house

1594
01:29:28.051 --> 01:29:32.370
one night and this motherfucker didn't wake up for nobody.
Nobody.

1595
01:29:32.371 --> 01:29:37.371
He didn't wake up five or six and they'd better be a cheeseburger and a blow job

1596
01:29:37.661 --> 01:29:41.130
waiting from,
that's not part of Badr Hari.
That's Carter Williams.

1597
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:43.630
That's Peter Graham.
This is Carter Williams.
Still wait,

1598
01:29:43.631 --> 01:29:46.710
if led Zeppelin got there at lunchtime,
he was out there with a robe on.

1599
01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:50.280
He gave bond them has watched this guy was the real deal though.

1600
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:52.080
This guy was the real deal.
Oh Elvis.

1601
01:29:52.081 --> 01:29:55.020
He was crazy as it guys watch an old movie couple of weeks.
I'm like,

1602
01:29:55.021 --> 01:29:58.990
you don't want,
look at this motherfucker.
It's 2014 this is two Pi.

1603
01:29:59.070 --> 01:30:02.280
This was 1950 I would have jumped out a window.

1604
01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:06.480
1950 if I would've seen this mother fucker come out and fucking moving.

1605
01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:11.040
Jailhouse rock.
God Damn.
Elvis was a fucking soldier.

1606
01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:16.110
He was good too,
man.
Fucking good man.
Yeah,
he was fucking good.
Go back.

1607
01:30:16.111 --> 01:30:17.790
Especially to the early days and just,

1608
01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:22.200
just taking him into account as a musician.
Jailhouse rock.

1609
01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:26.040
That's a great,
I love,
that's my jam.
I was a great song.

1610
01:30:26.041 --> 01:30:27.920
I love a couple of his fucking jams couple.
He's not.

1611
01:30:27.921 --> 01:30:31.460
He has a couple of fucking really good jams and you could feel his personality

1612
01:30:31.461 --> 01:30:34.080
and his smile.
It just something about Elvis.

1613
01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:37.410
He was just look at them at that point.
He was all fucked up.

1614
01:30:37.411 --> 01:30:41.740
He didn't give a fuck.
Fuck you bitch.
Fuck you.

1615
01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:46.770
He was wearing sunglasses.
He was so fucking bad.
That's how you know.
Yeah,
yeah.

1616
01:30:46.771 --> 01:30:49.490
You're wearing sunglasses in your mugshot and the constantly going and saying,

1617
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:53.910
I'm,
I'm fucking Elvis guy.
Listen man,
let me leave mom.
I can't do it.

1618
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:58.020
I can't do that right in here.
I'm saying things that aren't here.

1619
01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:00.900
It's the only things that keep me from the spirit world

1620
01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:04.980
plus one for the mind to full the show.

1621
01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:11.460
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes?
Who's things that shit?

1622
01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:17.350
Shit.
Yeah,
he,

1623
01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:22.320
he was a bad motherfucker did he took those chicks to town?
Women didn't.

1624
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:23.160
There it is.
Woo.

1625
01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:26.790
That's bought her throwing a wheel kick at him and Peter Graham won up catching

1626
01:31:26.791 --> 01:31:29.730
him.
That was a crazy fight.
Hold on.

1627
01:31:31.530 --> 01:31:32.363
Where's the

1628
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:36.570
<v 8>these high level kickboxers might hear this.
Watch this.</v>

1629
01:31:39.850 --> 01:31:42.610
<v 4>Oh Shit.
Oh Shit.</v>

1630
01:31:43.810 --> 01:31:48.130
<v 8>Play that shit again.
This is,
it's so crazy how he set it up too.</v>

1631
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:52.210
It was like a cartwheel,
like look at his hand drops down when he does it.

1632
01:31:52.450 --> 01:31:57.040
He like drops down with his right hand and throws his left leg over the top.

1633
01:31:57.070 --> 01:32:01.630
Watch this.
Watch how he does.
Oh No.
Okay.

1634
01:32:01.631 --> 01:32:06.130
You know what it was?
He threw a regular wheel kick but he fell so I'm wrong.

1635
01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:10.840
He just threw a left leg step.
He stepped in through a left leg,
we'll kick,

1636
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:12.160
but God damn

1637
01:32:12.970 --> 01:32:15.370
<v 5>kick is like getting shot with a sniper rifle.</v>

1638
01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:19.370
I wish I could fall among somebody out.
Well that was,
you know,
he fell from the,

1639
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:22.930
the the turn.
The torque of the turn.
That's,
that was incredible kick

1640
01:32:24.610 --> 01:32:28.330
by the way.
Edson Barboza the first guy to ever land one of those in the UFC.

1641
01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:33.250
He's fighting Donald's.
So Renee,
when that's on Fox in Orlando.

1642
01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:37.610
Oh Shit.
Joey D's that caught his path.
That's fucked.
That is,

1643
01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:39.100
that's gotten now is uh,

1644
01:32:39.130 --> 01:32:43.900
what's his name still at the Maximilian's over him or he left?
Yes.
Oh,

1645
01:32:43.901 --> 01:32:46.720
he's still,
well he trains with them.
He's still a part of their team,
but he's,

1646
01:32:46.721 --> 01:32:50.260
he did a lot of training in Thailand for his last fight.
Get rid of the keys.

1647
01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:54.970
He's Ange.
He's injured right now.
Who,
what Cuban get rid of me or no,
no.

1648
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.050
As far as I know,
Amir has been cut.
I haven't heard anything.
I love frame me,

1649
01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:02.630
but it's his time.
It's hard to Nigga.
I love him.
I fucking love him.

1650
01:33:02.631 --> 01:33:05.770
I'm the one of biggest fans with FLS fight you?
I don't think he's at.

1651
01:33:05.771 --> 01:33:09.640
He's not in New Mexico no more for this fight.
He wasn't,
he wasn't,

1652
01:33:09.641 --> 01:33:11.830
he doesn't like training away from home.

1653
01:33:11.831 --> 01:33:14.560
You know it's like to keep up with these new animals,

1654
01:33:14.561 --> 01:33:16.650
you have to keep yourself up at a different fucking pace.

1655
01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:20.260
It's like me saying to you,
you know,
want for my CD wide paper.

1656
01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:22.740
I'm not going to go on the road.
I'm just gonna.
I'm just gonna do sets it.

1657
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:26.860
The flap is going to go.
Okay Joey.
Hey Joey.
Okay,
Joey,

1658
01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:28.450
you're not going to go on a fucking wrong.

1659
01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.940
You're not going to go on the road and try your material.

1660
01:33:30.941 --> 01:33:33.430
You don't go to flappers and do 10 minutes every fucking night.

1661
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:35.440
That's what you're telling me.
Okay,
Joey.
Okay.

1662
01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:39.070
That's what it's like to me when you do a training camp,

1663
01:33:39.071 --> 01:33:42.010
I think you should go and you know,
sank in for six weeks.

1664
01:33:42.011 --> 01:33:46.570
It's like when I was a kid you had basketball and football camps and people

1665
01:33:46.571 --> 01:33:49.240
couldn't figure out like every time I put doctor she,
Joe Rogan,

1666
01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:51.130
he went to Willis Reed basketball camp.

1667
01:33:51.131 --> 01:33:53.380
That motherfucker came back better than ever.
No,

1668
01:33:53.381 --> 01:33:58.360
because for five days you were around pros and then told you little things like,

1669
01:33:58.361 --> 01:34:01.750
Hey,
don't put the ball past your waist.
They just corrected you.
I'm like,

1670
01:34:01.751 --> 01:34:05.200
I went to Joe Namath football camp.
One of the best experiences I've had,

1671
01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.150
I came back faster.
Yeah,

1672
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:12.270
I came back faster because they taught you how to run from seven 30 to eight

1673
01:34:12.491 --> 01:34:15.100
every morning.
They taught you how to run something.
Nobody ever did.

1674
01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:16.510
Sometimes it's just being around,

1675
01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:21.580
seeing the guy hits a ball grade senior guy who runs fast makes you want to run

1676
01:34:21.581 --> 01:34:23.350
faster.
It makes you really want to dig in.

1677
01:34:23.650 --> 01:34:26.950
Seeing guys that are really good at a sport and it takes that emotion of being

1678
01:34:26.951 --> 01:34:28.780
home,
my wife and this and this.
You know what?

1679
01:34:28.781 --> 01:34:31.300
I'll hang till nine what's the rush?
Well,
married,

1680
01:34:31.301 --> 01:34:34.060
I got to leave Jujitsu and run home.
Then when you're not,

1681
01:34:34.061 --> 01:34:37.090
you can stay at the gym till 10 o'clock at night because after the seven o'clock

1682
01:34:37.091 --> 01:34:39.940
train in this talk,
because when we fight him,
watch with a right hook,

1683
01:34:39.941 --> 01:34:43.260
right for the left field.
So that's why I always start training away.

1684
01:34:43.261 --> 01:34:46.870
He's very smart.
Fighters don't like it.
It's just hard on their families.
Sure.

1685
01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:51.160
That's,
that's where guys bring us,
we leave every other fucking week,
six weeks,

1686
01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:54.860
six,
six weeks away.
It's a long time.
That's not two days blown.

1687
01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:59.240
Disappear for fuck.
No I can't.
I gotta come back in three days.

1688
01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.580
I lose my fucking mind.
I agree with you though.

1689
01:35:01.581 --> 01:35:03.860
I think the only way to do it and compete at the highest levels,

1690
01:35:03.861 --> 01:35:06.470
you got to go somewhere or be lucky that you live in a town,

1691
01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:09.970
like if he live in New Mexico,
if you live in La,
you know,

1692
01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:12.090
and you're around the corner.
Yeah.
Duke or something,
you know,

1693
01:35:12.190 --> 01:35:15.470
at rain or you're at a king's MMA or something like that.
But still,

1694
01:35:15.471 --> 01:35:18.740
I think you got to move around.
Even with me.
They tell me,
listen,
Joey,
you know,

1695
01:35:18.741 --> 01:35:22.920
you come here to g g macros or White v Mac where I go for Jujitsu.
Which one?

1696
01:35:22.921 --> 01:35:26.150
White belts school.
They only been open for two years.

1697
01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:27.800
They got a couple of blue bumps they put on.

1698
01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:30.400
So a lot of John Joc people come down.
I don't have the ball.

1699
01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:35.050
You're just in it for a good exercise,
but I'm in it to learn something.
You know,

1700
01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:37.370
I got a daughter,
somebody attached and I looked to take them down north,

1701
01:35:37.371 --> 01:35:40.760
south him and get the fuck out of it.
You know,
I'm going to kill Eddie Bravo.

1702
01:35:40.761 --> 01:35:42.880
Call me.
He's like,
dog.
Well you need to do is learn to Nordstrom.

1703
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:47.750
Don't fuck with anything else.
Just north,
south,
north,
south kick.
Yeah,
but no,

1704
01:35:47.751 --> 01:35:50.900
he to tell me.
And then Salamis got a nasty north south.
That's what I heard.

1705
01:35:50.901 --> 01:35:53.400
I heard the Russians got the nasty side of all of them.
Oh,
he,

1706
01:35:53.410 --> 01:35:56.480
he's got to call me to talk to talk to Rashonda by learning

1707
01:35:58.230 --> 01:36:00.560
whatever sign is a really good north south.
Just go with it.

1708
01:36:00.561 --> 01:36:05.030
So I ended up at van eyes,
10th planet and fucking the guy did it to me,
bro.

1709
01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:07.970
My eyebrow was fucked up for three hours.

1710
01:36:07.971 --> 01:36:10.340
That's how good the north south choke from him.
He was like,
God,

1711
01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:12.980
he just taught me how to do it correctly.
It's harder with the Geek.

1712
01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:16.540
He told me that it's better Gnocchi.
I Dunno know,
I just,
I just need to,

1713
01:36:16.541 --> 01:36:20.480
it's harder to get your arm in the right position
to meet.

1714
01:36:20.481 --> 01:36:24.200
My eyebrow was blinking for like three hours on the one on one.

1715
01:36:24.201 --> 01:36:27.470
They kept fucking Blinken.
That's how hard he tapped my fucking face dog.
Yeah,

1716
01:36:27.471 --> 01:36:31.290
that can be a choke or it could be a neck crank depending on how you get it.
Uh,

1717
01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:35.720
Jamie Varner tried for it in his last fight was the first round right there.

1718
01:36:35.721 --> 01:36:37.280
He tried it and you begin to see that he was,

1719
01:36:37.281 --> 01:36:41.090
there was space between his chest in the ground and when you watch her son do it

1720
01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:41.661
or assign,

1721
01:36:41.661 --> 01:36:46.070
gets his lap on the side of your head and he gets this forum under your neck and

1722
01:36:46.071 --> 01:36:50.840
he's pinned down to the ground and he is squeezing the holy fucking Jesus out of

1723
01:36:50.841 --> 01:36:54.140
your neck.
It's technique.
It's all about getting in the perfect position.

1724
01:36:54.141 --> 01:36:57.050
It's like the difference between trying to finish off a triangle when it's over

1725
01:36:57.051 --> 01:37:00.620
your toes and taking the time to adjust when it's over the ankle and you get

1726
01:37:00.621 --> 01:37:04.910
that real solid fucking death triangle that no one gets out and then you pull

1727
01:37:04.911 --> 01:37:08.030
the head.
You know the guys who leave it on the toes.

1728
01:37:08.150 --> 01:37:11.580
Either they're afraid that in the transition and adjustment that they're going

1729
01:37:11.581 --> 01:37:14.270
to lose the position or they just don't have a good triangle,

1730
01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:17.360
but whatever the reason is,
it's this little details,
little details,

1731
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:19.580
not over the toes,
but over here.
Bam.

1732
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:23.450
That's one of the things that Eddie is so good at.
Eddie Bravo,
in my opinion,

1733
01:37:23.451 --> 01:37:25.340
is one of the best instructors in the world,

1734
01:37:25.341 --> 01:37:28.490
and I don't just say this because he's one of my favorite human beings and my

1735
01:37:28.491 --> 01:37:32.150
best friend,
he's a brilliant instructor,

1736
01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:35.960
like the way he breaks down positions and tells you about all the possible fit

1737
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:38.210
pitfalls.
He's one of the best in the world.

1738
01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:40.300
I mean I think there's a series of best in worlds.

1739
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:42.110
There might not be one best in the world.

1740
01:37:42.230 --> 01:37:46.650
John John Machado is clearly also one of the best in the world.
Drop Lino.

1741
01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:49.190
Clearly one of the best.
Nora oiler Gracie,

1742
01:37:49.191 --> 01:37:51.500
one of the best of the world hoists he,
Ron Henner.

1743
01:37:51.501 --> 01:37:54.650
There's a whole series of them,
but any Bravo's right up there with them.

1744
01:37:54.651 --> 01:37:58.900
That motherfucker breaks down positions very technically and gives you this like

1745
01:37:59.070 --> 01:38:04.070
really strong path and then gives you adjustments to deal with pitfalls in each

1746
01:38:04.081 --> 01:38:06.390
path.
Like what happens when you lose that position,

1747
01:38:06.391 --> 01:38:08.580
but then you go back to this and then you stop from here,

1748
01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:09.840
make sure he doesn't go here.

1749
01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:14.110
It's all like so technical and so broken down as like a,

1750
01:38:14.130 --> 01:38:17.250
as a science,
like a mathematical science.
Almost.

1751
01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:21.300
One thing I did notice about John Jocks,
guys,
they kill us.
Oh yeah,
no doubt.

1752
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:26.190
John Joc trains his people and they,
the people that trained me from John John,

1753
01:38:26.250 --> 01:38:30.480
I could see how they stress like Joey fucking use your weight guy but that

1754
01:38:30.481 --> 01:38:33.990
fucking form and his fate like Dell,
like Joe,
you're being nice to this guy.

1755
01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:37.130
Why are you being so nice to this guy?
Put Your fucking phone.

1756
01:38:37.131 --> 01:38:40.650
I can't hurt nobody.
I don't have it in me.
Put Your fucking foreman did that.

1757
01:38:40.651 --> 01:38:43.590
That they know like this one brown book took me,

1758
01:38:43.591 --> 01:38:46.350
this guy was dirty from,
from,

1759
01:38:46.351 --> 01:38:49.710
he was a Spanish gift from John John's and this kid was like,
dog,

1760
01:38:49.711 --> 01:38:52.990
I'm just north side.
I want you to twist this motherfucking rip that fucking on.

1761
01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:56.490
That's all you're doing.
Fuck that.
North South Pussy Shit.
This guy was like,

1762
01:38:56.491 --> 01:38:59.760
rip it.
That's what you got.
Take that fucking Geek.
Pulled them in,

1763
01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:02.430
grabbed that wrist and pull that fucking arm back.

1764
01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:05.520
Sounds like a nightmare to row with guy to this guy was on me.

1765
01:39:05.521 --> 01:39:08.340
I mean he fucked me up,
but he was running.
He goes,
you've got this weight,

1766
01:39:08.341 --> 01:39:10.740
you're wasting it.
Why are you wasting this fucking wife?

1767
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:13.530
I don't think it's creative.
For me it's like for me it's like improvising.

1768
01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:16.920
I could go in there and improvise and anytime I want and it's a 50 50 shot.

1769
01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:20.950
I don't like using my weight.
I rather,
I love attacking from the bottom too.

1770
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.240
Fucking fat.
Not a shape,
but that's my,
you can work on that though.

1771
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:28.440
If you just watch it,
I could do it.
I love it.
I love it.

1772
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:30.630
I fucking lost 80 pounds.
I love it Bro.

1773
01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:35.520
I love and I've lost 18 since at this stop.
That's beautiful bro.
I love,

1774
01:39:35.521 --> 01:39:39.690
you know,
I could do a,
like the other night some Japanese girl fucked me up.

1775
01:39:39.690 --> 01:39:41.480
I was just working on my garden.
I was just,

1776
01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:43.230
I just wanted to hold her in my guard.

1777
01:39:43.530 --> 01:39:46.590
But the guy who really to like the John Jack Black Belt who teach me.
It's funny,

1778
01:39:46.591 --> 01:39:47.181
somebody said to me,

1779
01:39:47.181 --> 01:39:52.181
you know that guy and then John junk have moves like from 1960s but they're,

1780
01:39:52.321 --> 01:39:55.410
your type of mood was like the first movie taught me was when they tried to

1781
01:39:55.411 --> 01:39:58.650
butterfly and I put my knee in his ass and pick his legs up and I was doing that

1782
01:39:58.651 --> 01:40:01.230
all the time and killing people and just weighing on him and shit.
And he's like,

1783
01:40:01.231 --> 01:40:04.470
that's an old school,
old school trick trick.
All those little things.

1784
01:40:04.471 --> 01:40:05.310
That's what he has.

1785
01:40:05.610 --> 01:40:08.700
And I could see where Eddie came in and evolve a lot of those moves now.

1786
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.960
Now I understand the beauty of Eddie Bravo when you guys are just talk to me in

1787
01:40:12.961 --> 01:40:14.730
a car.
I didn't know what the fuck you were saying.

1788
01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:16.830
I mean there's only one way to unborn motherfucker.

1789
01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:18.810
What are you guys talking about though?
He made it better.

1790
01:40:19.230 --> 01:40:23.310
I understand now the transition into the arm bar and all that shit.
I get it now.

1791
01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:24.810
Well,
John Jock,
you know,

1792
01:40:24.811 --> 01:40:28.740
one of the beautiful things about John Jack is that he encourages people to work

1793
01:40:28.741 --> 01:40:31.710
on new moves and try new things and he's very open.

1794
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:35.460
He rose with everybody and you know,
he's one of the best in the world.

1795
01:40:35.461 --> 01:40:38.880
I mean John Jackets,
he mean he's a a red belt on a Hixon Gracie.

1796
01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:43.200
I mean Hixon gave miss red belt.
That's like master status.
I mean,
and I would,

1797
01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:45.120
I would say there's,
you know,

1798
01:40:45.121 --> 01:40:49.860
maybe five people on the planet that have the type of Jujitsu knowledge that

1799
01:40:49.861 --> 01:40:54.010
John Jack has means a real old school master.
But he's also very open minded

1800
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:55.930
<v 0>and he likes when people do different things.</v>

1801
01:40:55.931 --> 01:40:58.990
And one of the reason is because he had to improvise a lot and change things a

1802
01:40:58.991 --> 01:41:02.770
lot himself because he was born on one of his hands,
his left hand,

1803
01:41:02.771 --> 01:41:07.090
he only has a thumb,
so he can't grab things like you were,
I can.

1804
01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:11.080
So he developed a bunch of techniques based on under hooks and over hooks

1805
01:41:11.290 --> 01:41:13.390
instead of what a lot of the key players are doing,

1806
01:41:13.391 --> 01:41:17.350
which was grabbing collars and grabbing sleeves because he couldn't control you

1807
01:41:17.351 --> 01:41:19.630
with two hands grasping things like this.

1808
01:41:19.810 --> 01:41:22.600
So he developed a more Greco Roman based style.

1809
01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:24.940
So when they went to Abu Dhabi,

1810
01:41:25.090 --> 01:41:27.430
when Abu Dhabi started the first submission championships,

1811
01:41:27.570 --> 01:41:31.150
Jacques was real running through motherfuckers and one of the reasons being is

1812
01:41:31.151 --> 01:41:34.630
John Jack didn't need a key,
like the [inaudible] didn't help him at all.

1813
01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:36.700
He didn't hit me,
he knew how to use it,

1814
01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:40.250
but John Jack was just as good without the g as with the gay.

1815
01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:44.110
And that was rare for a Brazilian jujitsu black belt because so many guys had

1816
01:41:44.111 --> 01:41:48.020
concentrated on training by grabbing a hold of the Geeky and grabbing hold the

1817
01:41:48.021 --> 01:41:50.650
pants and grabbing a hold of collars in a one hand,

1818
01:41:50.651 --> 01:41:54.700
it makes you more technical because you have to be really careful about your

1819
01:41:54.701 --> 01:41:56.320
defense when you're in a gay cause.

1820
01:41:56.321 --> 01:41:58.220
If a guy traps your arm and you're going to be,

1821
01:41:58.221 --> 01:42:01.210
you can't just pull out of it when you can,
like you can,
if you're all sweaty.

1822
01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:05.630
So it requires like a more tactical defensive,
uh,
uh,

1823
01:42:05.631 --> 01:42:08.860
attack or a defensive,
uh,
maneuvering.
And you gotta,

1824
01:42:08.861 --> 01:42:11.740
you gotta be real careful of getting yourself in a bad position to try to ape

1825
01:42:11.741 --> 01:42:13.540
out of them cause you might not ever be able to.

1826
01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:16.880
But John Jock was all over hooks and under hook,

1827
01:42:16.881 --> 01:42:20.200
so he didn't lose a step and he went into Aba dominant.

1828
01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:24.580
It's just like smashing guys.
The guys like soccer.
I like really high level,

1829
01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:28.750
like w MMA competitors and John [inaudible] is dominating them on the ground,

1830
01:42:28.751 --> 01:42:32.170
just dominating them,
taking their back,
choke in the fucking shit out of him,

1831
01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:37.300
sliding his one hand that,
you know,
he uh,
he,
uh,
he doesn't have a hand on it.

1832
01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:40.030
It fits into places where the hands get trapped.

1833
01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:42.700
So he figured out that he could get his,
like his,

1834
01:42:42.701 --> 01:42:46.540
his hand that doesn't have fingers.
It's,
there's not as much mass.

1835
01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:47.950
So he put like a point,

1836
01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:51.310
he slides it under your Chin and chokes the fucking shit out of you with it.

1837
01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:56.940
Like John Jack is actually almost more dangerous because he only had one hand

1838
01:42:57.310 --> 01:43:00.370
that just shows you like what human ingenuity can,

1839
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:04.720
can come up with when you're in a situation where like give you seen as Nick

1840
01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:05.553
Newell Kid,
you know who he is,

1841
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:10.900
he's an MMA fighter who has one arm and he's fucking people up.

1842
01:43:11.110 --> 01:43:14.470
He's fighting for the world series of fighting and a,

1843
01:43:14.471 --> 01:43:19.390
I'm pretty sure he's fighting for the title in his next fight and this fucking

1844
01:43:19.391 --> 01:43:23.470
kid is a beast.
He's got one arm,
he's got a right arm,
his left arm,

1845
01:43:23.471 --> 01:43:27.300
he was born with a and some sort of a birth defect,
whereas arms,

1846
01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:31.510
the only goes down to his elbow,
but he's still strangling motherfuckers,

1847
01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:33.390
taking guys down,
Ghia,
team them.

1848
01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:36.940
He's got this nasty guillotine that he does with like the one arm that's enough

1849
01:43:36.941 --> 01:43:40.750
and then the other full arm and it's like he gets you in that and it's your,

1850
01:43:40.751 --> 01:43:45.130
it's your ass,
it's death,
it's death.
Pull up Nick Newell,
Guillotine Choke.

1851
01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:49.480
It's a really impressive,
I love seeing shit like that,
man.

1852
01:43:49.570 --> 01:43:52.970
I love seeing someone who overcomes something that,
you know,

1853
01:43:52.971 --> 01:43:57.080
they just got a shit hand that the,
the World Delta,
they got,
they,
they,

1854
01:43:57.081 --> 01:44:00.120
the world delta.
They don't even think about it.
They're like,
fuck it.

1855
01:44:00.121 --> 01:44:03.470
I'm going to move on.
Well,
it makes him so determined,
you know,

1856
01:44:03.471 --> 01:44:05.630
it just shows you how much,

1857
01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:09.950
how much about succeeding at something is in the mind.

1858
01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:12.740
And how much is the mind finding the correct path.

1859
01:44:12.741 --> 01:44:17.600
Finding a way to overcome the mind is everything.
It's not just the body.

1860
01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:20.930
Because if a guy like this can be this successful,
I mean,

1861
01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:25.250
granted he's fighting in an organization where he's facing a level competition,

1862
01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:27.920
uh,
a step below the UFC.
I'm still,

1863
01:44:27.921 --> 01:44:31.340
as a person who's been analyzing fights most of my life,

1864
01:44:31.341 --> 01:44:34.670
I'm still impressed with them.
I'm very impressed with him.
He's dangerous.

1865
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:35.990
This kids fucking real.

1866
01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:38.740
Like I'm looking at that gaiety and my dad is a death guillotine.

1867
01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:40.070
You get caught in that fucking thing.

1868
01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:42.380
He's going to squeeze the blood out of your brain.
You Ain't getting out.

1869
01:44:42.381 --> 01:44:44.280
It doesn't matter if he's got one arm.
I'm watching that.

1870
01:44:44.290 --> 01:44:48.200
He's doing this nickname,
Neal Newell,
Newell,
n.
E.
W.
E.
L.
L.

1871
01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:53.000
I'm watching how he's doing this and I'm like,
this kid is an animal.
He's scary.

1872
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:55.730
I had a teacher in high school,
Mr Pennock,

1873
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:59.450
Coochie lost when I'm in Vietnam to his elbow.
What a great name.

1874
01:44:59.510 --> 01:45:04.140
He would fucking hit you with that stub during class.
If you disrespect him,

1875
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:07.970
he would clock you with that fucking stub and you don't know what the fuck to
do.

1876
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:11.370
You know what I'm saying?
Wow.
That's hilarious.
See if you can find,

1877
01:45:11.630 --> 01:45:16.100
just find what it is,
a videos cause he always wins by guillotine.

1878
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:19.340
Just load it up and let me know when it's ready.
Okay.
Um,

1879
01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:23.000
so did you hear what happened with the UFC this weekend?

1880
01:45:23.630 --> 01:45:28.010
Rashad Evans,
yes.
Gets injured.
They're going to qualify it off with Columbia,

1881
01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:30.550
but they had a replacement online.
Pat Comments,
that comment,

1882
01:45:30.570 --> 01:45:33.050
who I've known for a while,
Ryan has been,

1883
01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:36.140
Ryan's had this kid for awhile and he has a hardest time getting them fights.

1884
01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:40.490
Nobody wants to fight this kid.
He's a fucking beast,
man.
He's a beast.
I mean,

1885
01:45:40.491 --> 01:45:44.270
what a tall order.
Ryan Parsons,
he's vying Parsons Guy,

1886
01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:47.540
the guy who got hit with a golf ball.
Same Guy.
I Love Ryan Parsons.

1887
01:45:47.541 --> 01:45:50.920
I can't even think about that.
Then we get no fucking play golf.
Normal.

1888
01:45:50.970 --> 01:45:55.940
Six months,
six months.
Fucked up.
Yeah.
Well this kid,
pat is something,
man.

1889
01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:59.120
He's been talking about this kid for a long time.
I mean,
huge,

1890
01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:01.370
huge order for this kid.
I mean,

1891
01:46:01.530 --> 01:46:06.410
what a difficult task you're taking out more the best fucking wrestlers in the

1892
01:46:06.411 --> 01:46:08.780
world.
And Daniel Cormier,
as far as MMA,

1893
01:46:09.110 --> 01:46:13.640
one of the best wrestlers to ever fight in MMA.
What is this gala team?

1894
01:46:13.710 --> 01:46:17.750
It's in ethic yet?
No,
no.
Nick Newell.
Newell Gear Team.
This is him in a,

1895
01:46:17.751 --> 01:46:22.580
a a grappling match.
Oh,
that's not him,

1896
01:46:22.581 --> 01:46:27.280
man.
It's got two arms of Jesus Christ.
Nick Newell,

1897
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:32.300
n e w e l.
L.
Nothing.
Mm.
A gay teen.
Don't make me find it.
You fuck.

1898
01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:37.970
Might be it.
Um,
so this guy,
um,
who,
uh,
who we both know,

1899
01:46:37.971 --> 01:46:41.370
I know pat pretty well and uh,
I know that,
um,

1900
01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:45.020
Ryan has been trying to get this kid a fight for a long time,

1901
01:46:45.021 --> 01:46:45.950
but nobody wants to find them.

1902
01:46:45.951 --> 01:46:48.920
It's really hard to get in fights and smaller shows because they find out about

1903
01:46:48.921 --> 01:46:50.010
his wrestling credentials

1904
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:51.960
<v 5>and they're like,
oh,
Jesus,
two time,</v>

1905
01:46:51.961 --> 01:46:55.140
all American u s national and a undefeated fighter,

1906
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:59.490
Pat Commons now face the undefeated Daniel Cormier.
It's fucking crazy,

1907
01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:04.380
crazy tasks though to take that ad.
A,
um,
uh,
you know,

1908
01:47:04.381 --> 01:47:07.590
it's such a short notice,
but he used an undefeated collegiate wrestler.

1909
01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:10.410
There's going to be a good fight if you don't,
you,
you know,

1910
01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:14.550
undefeated fighter actually stand for me as improved every time he bro,

1911
01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:15.710
everybody believable.

1912
01:47:15.730 --> 01:47:20.520
It makes leaps and fucking bounds that guy and the sweetest fucking guy in the

1913
01:47:20.521 --> 01:47:23.820
world.
Oh yeah.
The sweetest creole motherfucker.

1914
01:47:23.821 --> 01:47:27.000
You can meet the sweetest guy in the world.
Yeah.

1915
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:30.900
He came to one of the shows when I did the big one in San Jose and we spoke for

1916
01:47:30.901 --> 01:47:32.490
a little while on the back and it was just,

1917
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:36.360
it really was really nice talking to him.
What a great guy.

1918
01:47:36.361 --> 01:47:38.780
And he's friends with what,
you know he's rendered Stevie Marcos,
right.

1919
01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:42.720
And all those guys.
So which King Mall a King?

1920
01:47:42.721 --> 01:47:46.890
Mo lost two.
Um,
the hardcore kid.

1921
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:50.950
What's his name?
Emmanuel Newton.
He lost a manual Newton.
So he's got one,

1922
01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:53.100
he's got one arm.
It's choking.
Oh my God.

1923
01:47:53.410 --> 01:47:56.820
What about the guy who was the black guy with the dreads from Africa?

1924
01:47:57.210 --> 01:48:01.150
So could you show,
where is he?
So could you lost two Musashi?

1925
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:04.290
Who is fighting Machida this weekend?

1926
01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:09.060
You also lost the Glover to share [inaudible] last step.
Machida,
the first fight.

1927
01:48:09.061 --> 01:48:12.540
And that was cheated on her,
but she is a,
that was the one that you,
I was like,

1928
01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:16.110
oh yeah,
it's a big black guys and a fuck him up.
I was at the fight.
You took me.

1929
01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:19.170
Yeah.
So could you as,
I think the,
the last loss was Musafa.

1930
01:48:19.190 --> 01:48:21.840
He's still fighting out of Henderson's camp because he was out there for a
while.

1931
01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:24.750
I don't know.
I don't know about that.
I know he was,
but uh,

1932
01:48:24.751 --> 01:48:28.140
he was a guy that was an unbelievable athlete.
Incredible judo.
What?

1933
01:48:28.141 --> 01:48:32.130
Fuck physical strength.
That guy too.
So could you just for whatever reason,

1934
01:48:32.131 --> 01:48:35.700
injuries his head,
who knows what it was,
just never quite put it together.

1935
01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:38.760
Not In the UFC.
Maybe he'll come back and we got Robbie Lawler put it together.

1936
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:40.890
Well that's the thing about circuit.
He's still a young guy.

1937
01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:44.040
A lot of people don't know how long this stuff,
not even 30 yet.

1938
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:45.930
He'll be back in the U S at least.
I don't think he has.

1939
01:48:45.931 --> 01:48:48.120
At least he wasn't back then.
I mean maybe he's 30 now,

1940
01:48:48.121 --> 01:48:49.960
but when he first began his career,

1941
01:48:49.961 --> 01:48:53.530
I'm pretty sure he's pretty young guy to imagine when it's,
it's really,
uh,

1942
01:48:54.210 --> 01:48:57.420
a great thing to see when you're struggling for a long time and all of a sudden

1943
01:48:57.450 --> 01:49:00.210
everything comes together.
At one time we were talking about Mark Maryland.

1944
01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:04.020
I came in here how I did this TV show on it podcast.
And that,

1945
01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:06.900
you know,
I don't know what went on or whatever.

1946
01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:10.820
I never had no problems with the guy.
And he reached out to me.
I did the podcast.

1947
01:49:10.821 --> 01:49:14.160
It was really good.
You guys had a thing a long time ago.

1948
01:49:14.610 --> 01:49:18.810
He used some something stupid.
Well,
you know,
he was also,
for the longest time,

1949
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:22.620
mark was just not that happy because he wasn't doing that well and he knew he

1950
01:49:22.621 --> 01:49:23.790
was a good comic,
but he just,

1951
01:49:23.791 --> 01:49:25.650
for whatever reason that things weren't clicking for him,

1952
01:49:25.651 --> 01:49:29.610
he wasn't getting the success that he wanted.
So he was more irritable,
you know?

1953
01:49:29.611 --> 01:49:33.340
So a lot of the conflict was kind of created during that period of disturbed the

1954
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:37.410
of turmoil,
turmoil in his life.
But now he's pretty chill.
I've known Mark A.

1955
01:49:37.410 --> 01:49:40.890
Long time.
And one thing about Mark Marin's,
he's always been a hard worker.
Yeah.

1956
01:49:41.010 --> 01:49:43.190
After I met mark,
you went to New York and put a up,

1957
01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:45.240
he went to Israel when he put that plan together.

1958
01:49:45.241 --> 01:49:47.810
That was a great reason why Michelle wrote a book too.
Yeah,

1959
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:51.730
that was a great thing.
You know,
Mark's never stopped from,
no,
that's the marker.

1960
01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:54.910
Real comics is that we don't stop you just because you don't see me.

1961
01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:56.620
It's like I tell people all the time,
look,

1962
01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:59.410
Joe Diaz is funny and we have a great time on the podcast,

1963
01:49:59.411 --> 01:50:02.500
but you're missing out on life if you don't get to go see David,
tell this shit.

1964
01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:05.500
You're really missing out on life if you don't see some of these old timers that

1965
01:50:05.501 --> 01:50:08.380
are in selling tickets just because they're not someone to tickets to go see
him.

1966
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:11.760
Go see Jim Breuer.
He's squeaky clean and a blow your fucking shit.
I told,

1967
01:50:11.770 --> 01:50:15.610
I heard bro,
you know the squeaky clean and murdering,
so I heard about brewer.

1968
01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:17.440
I heard he's murdering a Gi bill.

1969
01:50:17.441 --> 01:50:21.340
Bird told me that Jim brewers bit about his dad shitting his pants is possibly

1970
01:50:21.341 --> 01:50:25.140
the funniest thing he's ever seen.
His life.
Britain brewers,

1971
01:50:25.150 --> 01:50:27.900
a monster who was a monster for years,
for years.

1972
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:32.180
You told me you had a hard time once.
Found them to idea.
I bombed following him.

1973
01:50:32.181 --> 01:50:35.840
It wasn't a hard time.
I ate did.
He was one of the only time guys in Miami.

1974
01:50:35.841 --> 01:50:37.870
I used to follow them.
You know Miami.
I wrote my own ticket.

1975
01:50:37.871 --> 01:50:40.580
I the two lines of coke and went up there.
I'd take your fucking head off dude.

1976
01:50:40.581 --> 01:50:43.750
I watery.
I worked with you in Miami.
That motherfucker went up to and was like,

1977
01:50:43.751 --> 01:50:47.240
watch this bitch and just shut everybody the fuck.
Damn.

1978
01:50:47.250 --> 01:50:50.290
This is when he was getting high.
Now he's clean and sober.
He's a,

1979
01:50:50.291 --> 01:50:54.040
he's just like that if not better.
Better Bro.
It's 20 years.

1980
01:50:54.890 --> 01:50:58.410
It's 15 years and it all comes together.
Just like Robbie loyal.
Yeah.

1981
01:50:58.470 --> 01:51:02.440
It all comes together.
After a while you,
you shut this whole down,

1982
01:51:02.441 --> 01:51:06.550
this whole catch better.
This thing gets better.
This isn't a weakness no more.

1983
01:51:06.610 --> 01:51:08.650
Do you know what we found out about Robbie Lawler found?

1984
01:51:08.651 --> 01:51:13.651
It's about from war machine yesterday and Mike Sessman 11 he listened to the

1985
01:51:14.081 --> 01:51:17.740
podcast and then he got ahold of me on Twitter and let me know what's true.

1986
01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:19.510
Robbie Lawler doesn't spar.

1987
01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:23.710
He wrestles and he does all of his striking work,

1988
01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:26.230
kicking pads and hitting the mitts and hitting the back.

1989
01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:29.200
So he goes into these fights with no damage.

1990
01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:33.170
He goes in his fights with a rock solid chin.
He goes into these fights with no,

1991
01:51:33.171 --> 01:51:36.400
no punishment on his body.
I mean,
a little punishment,
I'm sure from wrestling,

1992
01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:39.560
but he,
and they ask him why?
He's like,
why should I do that?

1993
01:51:39.561 --> 01:51:44.320
I already know how to fight.
I mean,
if he wasn't knocking people the fuck out,

1994
01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:45.880
I would,
I would question it.

1995
01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:49.990
But we played his fight yesterday with Melvin Manhoef when he knocked out Melvin

1996
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:52.300
Manhoef,
you know,
and look at,
he just did the Rory Mcdonald.
He,

1997
01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:57.010
he had Lord Roy McDonald had deep shit.
Shit.
He's a bad motherfucker.

1998
01:51:57.011 --> 01:52:01.000
Him and Hendrix is a co crazy fight.
That's a crazy damn.

1999
01:52:01.001 --> 01:52:04.540
I can't wait to see that fight.
That could fucking top notch.
Fine.

2000
01:52:04.570 --> 01:52:08.470
But imagine that he says he doesn't spar.
He's very smart.
He put it together.

2001
01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:11.290
That's incredible.
He said,
you know what,
I got an idea.

2002
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:14.460
I'm not going to go in there with a black guy on my hair and I'm going to go in

2003
01:52:14.461 --> 01:52:18.010
there and fucking fresh and kill somebody and then it might work for him.

2004
01:52:18.130 --> 01:52:19.600
It might not work for somebody else,
Bro.

2005
01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:24.100
You know why I think it probably works for him cause he's so calm.
He's so calm.

2006
01:52:24.101 --> 01:52:26.740
He's been doing it so long.
Like he's so cute and you know,

2007
01:52:26.741 --> 01:52:31.090
they offered him to fight for the title.
He said cool.
That's pretty sad.

2008
01:52:31.330 --> 01:52:34.300
He's got,
he's got like this weird stoic demeanor.

2009
01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:37.900
So I think that he doesn't get to rattled and worry about the timing like some

2010
01:52:37.901 --> 01:52:42.580
people would do.
He just goes after it.
He's,
he's know guys like him.

2011
01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:46.670
The guy from New Orleans took the crazy kid from New Orleans.

2012
01:52:46.671 --> 01:52:51.160
The brother Tim Crater?
No,
the white.
The Black Alan Belcher from New Orleans.

2013
01:52:51.170 --> 01:52:54.600
Melvin Gallard.
Alvin Gla.
Yeah.
We've had over 40 fights record.

2014
01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:57.590
That's what you heard about.
What about the other 20th they didn't.

2015
01:52:57.870 --> 01:53:01.250
Confidence is right there.
You see somebody like John Jack on the bottom,

2016
01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:03.410
me and he was sweating.
I'm on the bottom.
I'm dying.

2017
01:53:03.770 --> 01:53:06.020
I'm about to shit my pants got,
that's experience.

2018
01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:08.990
You know when I go on the stage now and I say to jokes and they're going to

2019
01:53:08.991 --> 01:53:12.300
matter,
I don't give a fuck.
I'm gonna get myself on this motherfucking hole.

2020
01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:14.750
That's experience.
You know you do.

2021
01:53:14.751 --> 01:53:18.920
Sometimes I go on stage and I do things that I know I couldn't do six years ago.

2022
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:20.570
Right.
I know I couldn't do shotgun.

2023
01:53:20.890 --> 01:53:24.160
Robbie Lawler is really doing that and not sparring and camp than he.

2024
01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:29.000
He has a longer life in fighting than a lot of people because the only punches,

2025
01:53:29.001 --> 01:53:30.800
he's taken their t's taking them in fights,

2026
01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:33.650
but he's still going into the fight with a lot of Mitt work.

2027
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:35.660
He's still going into the fight,
hitting the bag.

2028
01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:38.090
It's still going to fight using rubber bands and weights.

2029
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:41.870
He still is visualizing.
He's still the guys holding the pads.

2030
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:44.210
He's ripping to the body.
When the guys are wearing body shields,

2031
01:53:44.211 --> 01:53:49.200
he's still hitting things real interesting,
man.
Real interesting because if,

2032
01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:53.930
if that turns out to be like an effective strategy,
boy that's going to recap.

2033
01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:57.530
I mean,
I don't know if it worked for everybody.
It might not work for everybody,

2034
01:53:58.250 --> 01:54:01.280
but for him,
if he can find other guys that follows that boy,

2035
01:54:01.281 --> 01:54:03.650
your career would last longer.
I may ask you a question.

2036
01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:06.500
Let's say you take your comedy.
Let's say you're doing this special

2037
01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:12.200
and your goal is to write every day,
two hours,
one hour in the morning,

2038
01:54:12.201 --> 01:54:14.270
one in the afternoon,
and then you'd do a set at night.

2039
01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:17.090
Let's pretend you don't go out that night and do a set for one month.

2040
01:54:17.091 --> 01:54:18.800
You just stay in and write that extra hour.

2041
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:22.890
Do you think it's going to affect your performance now that that's on me?

2042
01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:24.650
That's what he's doing.
The same thing a different way.

2043
01:54:25.370 --> 01:54:27.230
If I was a comic getting ready for something

2044
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:32.990
I just said to you joining and a waste my time going up and says the difference

2045
01:54:32.991 --> 01:54:36.820
is he's not taking damage.
When you're sitting at home and you're,

2046
01:54:36.821 --> 01:54:38.930
you're not going to comedy clubs,
there's no benefit.

2047
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:42.200
What he's getting is a very big physical benefit.

2048
01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:44.450
Meaning everybody goes into fights,
busted up,

2049
01:54:44.451 --> 01:54:46.130
everybody goes into fights with short ribs.

2050
01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:49.760
Everybody goes into fights with a headache.
They going to fight with a sore nose.

2051
01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:53.810
They might have loose teeth,
they might have fucking hurt hands.
He's not that.

2052
01:54:53.811 --> 01:54:58.130
That's an advantage.
That's a physical,
tangible advantage.
My point is,

2053
01:54:58.131 --> 01:55:01.190
look at Rodney Rodney quick comedy all those years when he came back at four

2054
01:55:01.191 --> 01:55:03.710
notebooks worth of jokes,
right?
For years,

2055
01:55:03.711 --> 01:55:06.290
they were kept putting them on TV and every time you show it,
Rodney at six,

2056
01:55:06.291 --> 01:55:09.080
no minutes,
people couldn't figure it out.
What's a biography?

2057
01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:12.710
It was that this mother fucker had eight notebooks all those years that he

2058
01:55:12.711 --> 01:55:14.480
wasn't right going on stage.
You kept writing,

2059
01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:18.980
kept writing and every time he did a new six minutes,
they're like,
what the fuck?

2060
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:23.390
He's got 10 hours.
God,
you're slipping with this guy.
So I think,

2061
01:55:23.391 --> 01:55:26.960
you know if this nights that I have a thing though,
if I work during the week,

2062
01:55:27.410 --> 01:55:30.500
you know,
Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday,
I take a plane at five in the morning.

2063
01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:33.890
I won't go out during the week but I'll take that time and write a little bit at

2064
01:55:33.891 --> 01:55:36.950
night just so I have a different avenue to go in there with.

2065
01:55:36.951 --> 01:55:39.410
If I'm not going to waste my time at night cause I'm out all fucking week.

2066
01:55:39.411 --> 01:55:40.400
I'm going to go out two nights,

2067
01:55:40.401 --> 01:55:44.370
three nights during the week and then for talk to people know I'm 50 fucking one

2068
01:55:44.371 --> 01:55:45.360
next week and you'll know that.

2069
01:55:45.450 --> 01:55:48.120
I think there's a big balance which we were writing and performing.

2070
01:55:48.121 --> 01:55:49.320
I think you got to do both.

2071
01:55:49.590 --> 01:55:53.700
I think the difference between us and a fighter is that a fighter is making a

2072
01:55:53.701 --> 01:55:57.180
strategy.
Look.
Obviously his performances having suffered at all,

2073
01:55:57.181 --> 01:55:58.014
he looks amazing.

2074
01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:02.230
I mean that fight with Roy McDonald was a fucking fantastic performance fight.

2075
01:56:02.250 --> 01:56:04.560
Josh Koscheck you destroyed your scarf second the first round,

2076
01:56:04.561 --> 01:56:09.210
so he's not suffering by this strategy and it works for him.

2077
01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:10.440
Every athlete's different.

2078
01:56:10.441 --> 01:56:12.660
Plus it gives them more of a reason to get the fuck out.

2079
01:56:12.670 --> 01:56:16.330
Then this motherfucker out.
Yeah,
wait,
take it out there.
I haven't got stage four,

2080
01:56:17.060 --> 01:56:20.130
but see with standup,
I think if you don't go off stage for a month,

2081
01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:23.170
it's different.
It fucks you up a little bit.
It's definitely a,

2082
01:56:23.250 --> 01:56:27.120
it's definitely up.
That's why going Thursdays,
Thursdays is my throwaway not,

2083
01:56:27.121 --> 01:56:29.790
I got a sheet of paper with everything I wrote during the week.

2084
01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:34.560
I got 120 hundred and 50 people and I just go,
I close with my regular routine,

2085
01:56:35.010 --> 01:56:37.110
but through all that shit out to see what I could grab it.

2086
01:56:37.111 --> 01:56:41.220
I'm just grasping for straws on Thursday night because I don't go out during the

2087
01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:42.053
week,
Friday and Saturday,
my Monday nights,

2088
01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:44.730
Thursday got a buck 20 I'll give him a good show,

2089
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:48.000
but I'll throw out some new shit in that just to catch up for the week to see

2090
01:56:48.001 --> 01:56:50.220
what I wrote.
Maybe it's not funny and if you don't do that,

2091
01:56:50.221 --> 01:56:52.350
those jokes don't get told and they don't get made.
I mean,

2092
01:56:52.351 --> 01:56:55.440
think about how many jokes that you have where you started out and it was kind

2093
01:56:55.441 --> 01:56:59.250
of a premise and I've seen you like have bits that started out and they just

2094
01:56:59.251 --> 01:57:01.320
stay,
just weren't clicking.
There was something missing.

2095
01:57:01.321 --> 01:57:04.920
And then I see you like four weeks later and boom it slam and you figured out

2096
01:57:04.921 --> 01:57:07.140
the right path.
You figured out how to shorten it up,

2097
01:57:07.290 --> 01:57:10.140
you figured out how to get to the funny part quicker,
boom.
And then it's,

2098
01:57:10.141 --> 01:57:13.050
it's killing.
Got To start somewhere.
You know,
it's funny,
uh,
again,

2099
01:57:13.051 --> 01:57:14.920
when I was in a sense doing the thing with Mark Merrill,

2100
01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:18.750
he looked at me and he goes,
oh it is it to get workout space anymore.

2101
01:57:19.890 --> 01:57:22.720
He goes,
it sucks cause everybody wants you to perform.
Yeah.

2102
01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:26.610
As long as the days of going through the store on a Tuesday and just ripping a

2103
01:57:26.611 --> 01:57:30.480
notebook and going,
because people are showing up to really see you,
you know,

2104
01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:34.650
and did you see what he's doing?
And he got a theater cause he said he was drunk.

2105
01:57:34.651 --> 01:57:38.340
I go on the road in two weeks,
I have zero material.
Zero.

2106
01:57:38.341 --> 01:57:42.120
You know how it is your TV show for fucking six months and he goes,

2107
01:57:42.121 --> 01:57:44.070
he gets out twice a week.
So I go,
what are you going to do?

2108
01:57:44.071 --> 01:57:48.600
So he tweeted that he got a fever,
some little theater on Santa Monica Boulevard,

2109
01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:51.720
right.
He's going to do shows for two weeks.
All the money benefits to feed it.

2110
01:57:52.230 --> 01:57:56.580
Wow.
That's going to take the money.
And he's,
you know,
and that's uh,

2111
01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:00.150
guys like us need somewhere to go and just talk and he's going to do it every

2112
01:58:00.150 --> 01:58:02.680
night of the week.
I Dunno how many nights really?
I don't know what nights.

2113
01:58:02.690 --> 01:58:04.870
And it's a great idea.
That's a great idea.
Yeah.

2114
01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:07.920
It's perfect for him too because he know her only get his people that know what

2115
01:58:07.921 --> 01:58:11.820
he's doing and they won't be in this unfair expectation or this weirdness and

2116
01:58:11.821 --> 01:58:14.610
he'll be able to form the bits that way.
When I was talking to Tim Allen,

2117
01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:14.971
he was like,

2118
01:58:14.971 --> 01:58:19.290
I'm going to Vegas and fucking Jamie Masada keeps putting my name on the fucking

2119
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:22.380
bored.
I don't want nobody to come see me.
It got Tim Allen's,

2120
01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:24.130
let me tell you how crazy it got for tomorrow.

2121
01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:27.360
I got to the point where he was showing up on Tuesdays just to do the three

2122
01:58:27.361 --> 01:58:30.660
minutes because he know Jamie wouldn't put his name on the fucking board.
Ah,

2123
01:58:30.661 --> 01:58:35.220
that's hilarious.
Hilarious.
He just wanted to try just talk.
Yeah,
just talk.

2124
01:58:35.221 --> 01:58:37.980
But when you go up to come in and say that people clap and they expect you to be

2125
01:58:37.981 --> 01:58:39.840
funny and you just can't try your shit out.

2126
01:58:39.841 --> 01:58:44.290
So I saw him go on stage after a long time off one night in the main room at the

2127
01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:47.740
comedy store.
It was weird.
It was weird.
You could tell he's just like,

2128
01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:50.830
he just hadn't done it in a long time.
You'd see him like,

2129
01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:54.550
I mean you watched the old specials before is before his show,

2130
01:58:54.551 --> 01:58:58.600
before home improvement and you would see him like do his comedy is like so much

2131
01:58:58.601 --> 01:59:03.160
confidence and speed to it and so much energy to them and it's just so good.

2132
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:09.310
Sharp,
sharp.
But then you saw him after the show and it was just like,
you know,

2133
01:59:09.311 --> 01:59:13.210
just trying to step on the stage and oh,
how would I stand right here?

2134
01:59:13.211 --> 01:59:16.870
And you know,
just weird.
You could see he just,
it wasn't a part of him anymore.

2135
01:59:16.871 --> 01:59:19.090
He'd let it go away.
I wonder if they,

2136
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:22.240
I had heard the rumor that they wanted him to not do comedy while he was doing

2137
01:59:22.241 --> 01:59:26.890
home improvement cause is uh,
the show was such a family show and his act was so,

2138
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:31.210
you know,
kind of funky.
You never know.
I mean it wasn't even that,

2139
01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:35.440
that radical and act,
it was just pretty,
pretty mainstream.
Normal Act.

2140
01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:38.500
I mean you never know what they tell you.
You know,
I just love doing it.

2141
01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:39.640
I love getting them.

2142
01:59:39.641 --> 01:59:42.430
Like last night I went on stage and had a great fucking time.
You know,

2143
01:59:42.490 --> 01:59:44.830
just the Wednesday night [inaudible] gives a fuck.

2144
01:59:45.190 --> 01:59:49.830
I don't like going to Hollywood,
no mall.
No,
I like the Improv.
I like the end,

2145
01:59:49.831 --> 01:59:52.870
but I still like doing the Improv.
I did it a couple of weeks ago.
It was great.

2146
01:59:53.170 --> 01:59:55.960
I enjoy this.
I called for spots at the laugh factory for next week,

2147
01:59:55.961 --> 01:59:59.590
but long beach brother got me that.
Got Spot.
All right,
I'll go with you.

2148
01:59:59.650 --> 02:00:03.250
Let's do it.
I got like Long Beach.
Let's do a week night.
Let's do a week night.

2149
02:00:03.251 --> 02:00:07.160
Like maybe next week or so.
I really like it.
I really like it down.

2150
02:00:07.670 --> 02:00:10.420
You do Thursdays every Thursday.
That's when they gave me Thursdays.

2151
02:00:10.421 --> 02:00:12.790
It closes at 10 so we're out of there.
Bitch.

2152
02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:17.380
What time do you leave to get down there?
Two in the afternoon.
No,
no,
no.

2153
02:00:17.770 --> 02:00:20.820
Cause I think the five for the second time.
Cause that's it.

2154
02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:23.370
It shows the eight o'clock guys.
Okay.
So what time do you leave?

2155
02:00:23.371 --> 02:00:26.560
I leave my house at eight 30 the show's at eight and you leave at eight 30.

2156
02:00:26.561 --> 02:00:31.150
Oh your honor.
Your honor.
Okay.
30 minutes.

2157
02:00:31.151 --> 02:00:33.670
It's real fucking,
I don't look,
I don't touch the one thing.

2158
02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:36.610
I go to five to the one to the one.
Uh,

2159
02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:38.680
whatever the fuck I just said to find four or fives.

2160
02:00:38.681 --> 02:00:42.200
The motherfucker you want to ignore this weekend guys,
ignore that motherfucker.

2161
02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:45.920
Pretend it's not real.
The fives bad too though.

2162
02:00:45.921 --> 02:00:50.500
Especially near near the Disneyland.
Oh,
by,
by farm boots.
Whatever.
That is.

2163
02:00:50.501 --> 02:00:54.310
Not Boone's farm.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
The,
you didn't know about gems.

2164
02:00:54.311 --> 02:00:59.140
Zillow this weekend.
What are we doing?
Four or five north this weekend?

2165
02:00:59.141 --> 02:01:03.250
Dog.
Tomorrow.
One day they're going to,
uh,
uh,

2166
02:01:03.260 --> 02:01:07.270
is that bridge Hov Lane?
10 miles of the four.
Oh five.
What a good idea.

2167
02:01:07.271 --> 02:01:11.110
It's not like it's Valentine's Day or anything.
Nobody felt traveling.

2168
02:01:11.111 --> 02:01:12.430
What about the motherfuckers in New York?

2169
02:01:12.431 --> 02:01:15.190
They ain't gonna be no Valentine's Day and New York drag.
Yeah.
How much?

2170
02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:16.810
How much do I think here?
We've got eight today.

2171
02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:19.870
My friends got eight and they got another six tonight and they're going to get

2172
02:01:19.871 --> 02:01:23.320
three more on Saturday.
But the city shut down completely.

2173
02:01:23.321 --> 02:01:25.990
Like the fucking Jersey road.
Just shut down.
It's fucking,

2174
02:01:26.350 --> 02:01:29.500
it's amazing what's going on back there.
I love it.
Wow.
Yeah,

2175
02:01:29.501 --> 02:01:31.470
they're getting a lot of snow.
You remember when,
uh,

2176
02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:34.840
Bloomberg was mayor and they forgot to pay for snowplows.

2177
02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:39.680
They didn't a budget in for plowing snow and people were like trapped in their

2178
02:01:39.681 --> 02:01:40.300
fucking houses

2179
02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:42.600
<v 0>and they were all making these videos of people slamming into cars,</v>

2180
02:01:42.650 --> 02:01:45.920
like trying to get out of their spots and drive down unplowed roads,

2181
02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:52.040
tractor clearing snow kills pregnant New York home and Jesus Christ.
Fucking,
God

2182
02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:55.490
<v 1>dammit.
Where are you going for Valentine's Day?

You guys talk?
I got a beat.</v>

2184
02:01:58.060 --> 02:02:00.470
My wife's in Nashville with the baby.
The father is sick,

2185
02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:05.040
<v 1>so she went back there until Tuesday to spend time with the father and the baby</v>

2186

What do you want to go?
Kind of spot tomorrow night and Saturday.

2188
02:02:10.771 --> 02:02:13.560
So it's all worked working there every time for me.

2189
02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:16.500
You don't have no shows this weekend?

2194
02:02:31.130 --> 02:02:33.740

I uh,

2198
02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:45.570
am playing La Jolla comedy store.

2199
02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:46.633
<v 9>MMM.</v>

2200
02:02:46.970 --> 02:02:51.410
<v 1>February 28th or March 1st we're having four or five shows.
Me,</v>

2201
02:02:51.411 --> 02:02:55.010
Tony Hinchcliffe,
Sarah Wine Shank,
bunch of other people.

2202
02:02:57.140 --> 02:03:00.020
Have you done that?
Do you miss doing like the La La Jolla comedy store?
Any that,

2203
02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:03.760
any of that now?
Did you ever do it much heart?

2204
02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:07.190
That was my spot.
The lowboy comedy club.

2205
02:03:07.610 --> 02:03:11.120
Do you like staying at the condo is a big rats there.

2206
02:03:11.210 --> 02:03:13.910
I would come right home every Saturday,
every Friday and Saturday.

2207
02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:18.710
I don't spend the night in San Diego.
I come right home.
I leave at 1145.

2208
02:03:18.711 --> 02:03:22.100
I'm home by like fucking one 30 and San Diego.
Yeah.

2209
02:03:22.190 --> 02:03:24.800
I don't like spending the night.
Did you ever stay at the condo down there?

2210
02:03:25.420 --> 02:03:29.470
<v 0>Definitely the places that dump,
Oh my God,
it was disgusting.
Their comedy store,</v>

2211
02:03:29.471 --> 02:03:31.350
Condo Woo.
Then we still,

2212
02:03:31.351 --> 02:03:34.490
they move to an apartment like I guess there are renovating the Condo and I

2213
02:03:34.491 --> 02:03:35.980
moved to an apartment.
Apartment was nice.

2214
02:03:36.010 --> 02:03:39.550
Then the second time we got me a hotel room.
Yeah,
we had enough.

2215
02:03:40.030 --> 02:03:43.900
I had that fear factor money burning a hole in my pocket.
This hotel,

2216
02:03:43.901 --> 02:03:46.480
it's like right next door.
That's really nice.
Where I was like,

2217
02:03:46.481 --> 02:03:50.710
let's say like gentlemen,
we'll still like gentlemen and again,
I see a towel.

2218
02:03:51.370 --> 02:03:55.160
How about that fucking Mexican joint across the street from the hotel that had

2219
02:03:55.170 --> 02:03:58.600
that unsane chicken burritos.
Insane.
I'm still there.

2220
02:03:58.601 --> 02:04:00.610
I forgot the one around the devotees.
Yeah.

2221
02:04:00.850 --> 02:04:05.050
They were so big that you could start eating them and start walking to Mexico

2222
02:04:05.110 --> 02:04:07.570
and you would get to Mexico.
Right when the Burrito was done.

2223
02:04:08.770 --> 02:04:12.130
These guys are telling me about all these fucking food spots on sunset to the

2224
02:04:12.131 --> 02:04:14.290
delicious.
I just don't go to Hollywood at night.

2225
02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:17.650
They say there's a Mexican place across the street from the laugh factory.

2226
02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:19.630
Willie Taco place,

2227
02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:24.220
peachy peach body are right across the street where Virgin Mega store,

2228
02:04:24.221 --> 02:04:26.440
you should be there now.

2229
02:04:26.740 --> 02:04:30.430
Virgin has gone right Virgin Mega store or was it tower records?

2230
02:04:30.490 --> 02:04:33.850
Was it tower records,
records,
something.
Was there tower in Hollywood,

2231
02:04:33.851 --> 02:04:35.140
one of those,
virgin or tower.

2232
02:04:35.260 --> 02:04:37.680
They say that the fucking place where you always talk about it now.

2233
02:04:37.681 --> 02:04:38.160
What's the place

2234
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:40.080
<v 1>you always talk about that?
You say you go late night,</v>

2235
02:04:40.081 --> 02:04:42.900
they're open till three or four fat sounds and what did they have there?

2236
02:04:43.110 --> 02:04:45.080
It's just huge.
It's like the sandwiches.
It's,

2237
02:04:45.081 --> 02:04:46.620
it's owned by the guy from entourage.

2238
02:04:46.621 --> 02:04:50.400
Turtle from entourage and it's just like these huge sandwiches that they have

2239
02:04:50.401 --> 02:04:53.520
like fries,
like they have cheese fries instead of fries on the sandwich.

2240
02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:57.690
They have cheese fries on a sandwich and they have Google.
Yeah.
If you walk,

2241
02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:02.580
you look at and you're like,
this is the worst thing ever to eat.
Crazy delicious.

2242
02:05:02.610 --> 02:05:07.460
It's always packed.
Smart move,
man.
Take that entourage money.

2243
02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:11.550
Invest it.
She was not entourage now,
but Ronda Rousey's.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2244
02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:14.220
There's a sheet in the movie or the TV show.
Movie movie.
There's

2245
02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:15.240
<v 0>an entourage movie.</v>

2246
02:05:15.241 --> 02:05:17.490
She's going to start in the movie and she's got another movie that they're

2247
02:05:17.491 --> 02:05:19.800
making totally for her with her as a star

2248
02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:24.690
blowing up like the world trade.
Oh,

2249
02:05:24.900 --> 02:05:28.250
because they say she might retire after this fight.
The shoot the shit retire,

2250
02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:31.380
retiring.
Shit.
She likes beating the fuck out of checks.
She absolutely likes it.

2251
02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:34.710
She enjoys it.
She's really good at it and she's really good at doing it.

2252
02:05:34.711 --> 02:05:38.190
Even with all the pressure of that,
like Misha Tate fight all the media pressure.

2253
02:05:38.730 --> 02:05:42.390
Dude,
her judo is the best judo in MMA right now.

2254
02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:46.020
Those fucking throws that she hit me Hsa with me.

2255
02:05:46.021 --> 02:05:49.650
She got high on her and just launched.
You know what I mean?
If you,

2256
02:05:49.651 --> 02:05:53.610
if you're shooting on Rhonda,
you have to be blower hips.
You gotta be,

2257
02:05:53.790 --> 02:05:54.990
you can't be up high,

2258
02:05:55.290 --> 02:05:58.710
have you shoot on her and you think you got to rest under her armpits like you

2259
02:05:58.711 --> 02:05:59.610
can with other girls.

2260
02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:03.900
She's gonna get an under hook and get her leg across your leg and you are going

2261
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:08.520
fly in.
She throws bitches.

2262
02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:10.890
But the chicks he's fighting this weekend is Sara Mcmann.

2263
02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:14.280
Sarah McMahon is an Olympic silver medalist.
He's built like Gleason t bow.

2264
02:06:14.850 --> 02:06:18.720
You ever see her?
Sarah McMahon is fucking huge.
Dude.

2265
02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:23.250
She looks like me in a dress.
I'm not joking for a girl like she has arms,

2266
02:06:23.251 --> 02:06:27.210
like a guy that's going to be a good fight.
Yeah,
she's really powerful man.

2267
02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:30.870
And she's a really good wrestler.
Her technique is excellent,
you know,

2268
02:06:30.871 --> 02:06:33.810
and she's a silver medalist in the Olympics and Rhonda is a bronze medalist in

2269
02:06:33.811 --> 02:06:36.300
judo.
This is the first time in the history of the UFC.

2270
02:06:36.301 --> 02:06:38.310
Two medalists are going at it.

2271
02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:40.950
Two Olympic medalists and they both happen to be women.
I mean,

2272
02:06:40.951 --> 02:06:45.510
it's fucking crazy.
It's a huge significant fight.
Like for women's MMA.

2273
02:06:45.690 --> 02:06:47.580
I mean you talk about like legitimizing it,

2274
02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:52.070
it's silver medalist in the Olympics and a bronze medalist in judo.
One in a,

2275
02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:55.410
one in wrestling and one in judo.
That's crazy people.
It's never happened.

2276
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:57.900
It sounds a lot of seats.
People love to see those lists.
Will,

2277
02:06:57.901 --> 02:07:00.720
should have the last fight,
man,
that was,
you know,
it was a shame what happened,

2278
02:07:00.721 --> 02:07:01.800
man,
to sign that card.

2279
02:07:01.801 --> 02:07:05.580
But that fucking fight sheet that would mean I watched it with Red Bay.

2280
02:07:05.610 --> 02:07:08.450
We were on our feet,
your house,
we were fucking blown crazy fight.

2281
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:13.050
The only other time to Olympians or thought was two gold medalists Rulon Gardner

2282
02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:17.130
and Yoshida fought in pride.
Um,
and Rulon Gardner.

2283
02:07:17.131 --> 02:07:20.940
That was before he was on biggest loser or one of those shows where he tried to,

2284
02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.640
he got like way high like in the four hundreds,

2285
02:07:23.850 --> 02:07:26.820
and he was like really unhealthy and he had to lose weight to get down there.

2286
02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:31.290
Sarah McMahon,
she's,
she's tough dude.
The chicks tough.

2287
02:07:31.410 --> 02:07:35.830
Let me Go pee real quick.
You Go pee fella.
There's a picture of her,
uh,
in the,

2288
02:07:35.831 --> 02:07:39.280
the Promo clip where she stands there like in that picture,

2289
02:07:39.281 --> 02:07:40.660
arms aren't pumped up with blood,

2290
02:07:40.810 --> 02:07:44.560
but she stands up after a fight and she raised her arms and be like,
cheese us.

2291
02:07:44.561 --> 02:07:47.800
Fuck.
They're huge.
She's strong as shit.

2292
02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:51.460
She's probably going to be the strongest woman that Ron has fought in her career

2293
02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:55.570
and probably also going to have the best grappling technique at anybody run has

2294
02:07:55.571 --> 02:07:58.880
ever fog because her takedown defense is just impeccable.
Plus her,

2295
02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:00.250
her grappling knowledge,

2296
02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:03.760
like she won't do the same sort of things that may be other opponents have done

2297
02:08:03.761 --> 02:08:05.440
that has allowed Rhonda toss them.

2298
02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:08.110
She's going to be more on point with their takedown defense.

2299
02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:12.460
So to become much more interesting,
but Ronda Rousey,
in my opinion,

2300
02:08:12.461 --> 02:08:15.610
she has the bay,
not just the best judo in MMA,
but the best arm bars.

2301
02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:20.410
Her arm bar technique is flawless and she hits it from everywhere and there's no

2302
02:08:20.411 --> 02:08:25.090
space.
Like when she slaps an arm bar on someone,
everything is tight,
all,

2303
02:08:25.091 --> 02:08:25.421
every,

2304
02:08:25.421 --> 02:08:29.650
everything is in perfect position and she's so used to people moving when you

2305
02:08:29.651 --> 02:08:31.720
buck one way,
she's ready for you to do that.

2306
02:08:31.721 --> 02:08:34.660
So she's already countering it and then she just rolls with you and it gets it

2307
02:08:34.661 --> 02:08:37.420
tighter if you buck the other way.
She's got that planned out too.

2308
02:08:37.540 --> 02:08:39.070
Like she's so good at writing.

2309
02:08:39.071 --> 02:08:42.310
You like a bull when you start bucking and twist and to try and get out of that

2310
02:08:42.311 --> 02:08:43.180
arm bar,
she is,

2311
02:08:43.181 --> 02:08:47.830
follows you and she does it so often because she's so good at this one
technique.

2312
02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:50.950
She just hits that arm bar over and over and over and over again.

2313
02:08:51.370 --> 02:08:53.470
Her arm bars a thing of beauty that you can't,

2314
02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:55.420
you couldn't pick a better fighter to watch.

2315
02:08:55.450 --> 02:08:56.800
If you wanted to learn how to do an arm bar,

2316
02:08:56.801 --> 02:08:58.900
then Ronda Rousey couldn't pick a better fighter.

2317
02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:02.390
Her fucking technique's flawless.
I mean,
I,

2318
02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:04.480
I learned something new every time I watch your head and arm bar,

2319
02:09:04.481 --> 02:09:06.490
that's not bullshit.
I learned new setups.

2320
02:09:06.491 --> 02:09:08.830
I learned new transitions and learn new recoveries,

2321
02:09:09.070 --> 02:09:12.640
how she recovers from losing a position and she doesn't even hold the legs a lot

2322
02:09:12.641 --> 02:09:16.390
of the times.
Like a lot of guys like Eddie,
Eddie will cross his feet over the,

2323
02:09:16.391 --> 02:09:19.690
uh,
the face and then hold the leg to keep you from Bob Bucking around.

2324
02:09:19.810 --> 02:09:23.740
Ron is like,
go ahead bitch.
Go Buck around cause I'll just roll with you.

2325
02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:24.760
I'll just roll with you.

2326
02:09:24.761 --> 02:09:27.640
And in the transition I'll fucking grab that thing and make it even tighter.

2327
02:09:28.510 --> 02:09:32.200
She's incredible man.
And she saw,
it's ridiculous.

2328
02:09:33.870 --> 02:09:37.570
I tweeted for Fox sports one yesterday.

2329
02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:40.330
I did a one of those Fox sports,
one shows talking about,
uh,

2330
02:09:40.630 --> 02:09:43.810
the UFC and talking about fights and I tweeted something about curling.

2331
02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:47.260
That's hilarious.
I couldn't believe it.
People got mad at me.

2332
02:09:47.261 --> 02:09:51.440
One of the Olympic curling guys got mad at me and I retweeted his shit.

2333
02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:54.760
Oh my God.
That poor pastor got attacked.
I feel bad for him.

2334
02:09:56.290 --> 02:09:59.380
I didn't think it was that big of a deal that I call it dumb shit.

2335
02:09:59.381 --> 02:10:01.570
I like a lot of dumb shit.
It's nothing wrong with dumb shit.

2336
02:10:01.571 --> 02:10:04.540
Why don't you care what I'd like to,
but people were getting so offended.

2337
02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:07.850
A woman said,
shame on you.
That's what she said to me.
No,

2338
02:10:07.940 --> 02:10:10.340
last week on the podcast,
I thought,

2339
02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:14.790
fucking if you need a blow torch to smoke weed,
go fuck you.
See,

2340
02:10:14.791 --> 02:10:17.440
I mean you fucking crack,
right?

2341
02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:22.030
I want you to understand what marijuana is and you want to show up with a

2342
02:10:22.031 --> 02:10:24.100
fucking blow torch to my fucking house,

2343
02:10:24.101 --> 02:10:28.220
but a rock and put oil and people keep telling me like,
go,
you got to,

2344
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:31.550
I did it one time.
I'm like,
this ain't for me guys.
I don't see,

2345
02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:34.140
it was like freebasing for me.
Yep.

2346
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:37.280
<v 4>I never understood the drama.
Just give me customer this fucking,</v>

2347
02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:41.690
I got to pull it.
I got to put it in a sock and cook it and then you know,

2348
02:10:41.691 --> 02:10:45.920
I went to a party one time,
like 25 grams of coke in 1982 I'm not kidding you.

2349
02:10:45.921 --> 02:10:48.650
I went and I bought those little vibe when they used to come and bottles already

2350
02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:52.280
and I bought the guy out and I fucking went to this house and all I wanted to do

2351
02:10:52.281 --> 02:10:55.560
with snoring,
get my dick sucked and this fucking white dude,
you know,

2352
02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:58.430
it was like,
oh,
we don't snort cocaine here.

2353
02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:02.900
You got to cook it and then put it through a silk sock.
A Silk Kanka shift.

2354
02:11:03.110 --> 02:11:04.040
If it's not silk,

2355
02:11:04.041 --> 02:11:07.670
it's not going to work and it takes 20 minutes just to do it and then we got to

2356
02:11:07.671 --> 02:11:09.380
do it.
Fuck that.
Just give me the code.

2357
02:11:09.540 --> 02:11:12.350
It's the same thing with those fucking dabs.
My buddy came over,

2358
02:11:12.351 --> 02:11:14.890
he puts a rock on your desk,
then they melted.

2359
02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:18.370
Then you've got to take a straw and you cock your ass off.
Said No,

2360
02:11:18.630 --> 02:11:23.510
just give me just roll the fuck.
I sat down on the podcast guys.
I got tormented.

2361
02:11:23.610 --> 02:11:25.940
Yeah.
People were like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

2362
02:11:25.941 --> 02:11:28.580
You know what you're talking about with Deb's.
I'm hearing what I'm saying.

2363
02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:33.650
If you need a blow torch to get high,
there's a fucking problem.

2364
02:11:34.370 --> 02:11:36.890
I don't give a fuck what it does to you.
You know what?

2365
02:11:36.891 --> 02:11:39.680
I smoke a fucking joint and I get stoned to the Goddamn Gill's.

2366
02:11:39.710 --> 02:11:42.830
That's all I need.
I'll eat an edible and I get fucked up on those too,

2367
02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:45.260
but fucking Babs,

2368
02:11:45.420 --> 02:11:47.760
<v 1>it's really sad too because we had talked about this before,</v>

2369
02:11:47.761 --> 02:11:51.720
like the places up north and stuff that they have these dab houses where you

2370
02:11:51.721 --> 02:11:55.230
walk in and everyone has a glass pipe.
It's like being in a crack house.

2371
02:11:55.231 --> 02:11:57.030
It's the closest thing.
Does the same graph?

2372
02:11:58.590 --> 02:12:01.710
<v 4>Pardon me?
That that kind of stuff has always been like,
well,</v>

2373
02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:04.740
you get high or I'm better than you.
Like this is what I'm doing.

2374
02:12:04.741 --> 02:12:07.830
Like you're a fucking idiot if you have to go this far to fucking do this shit.

2375
02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:12.020
Like if I,
it's like making meth gatoraid even make method of fucking again.

2376
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:16.800
Never make meth out of the gate Gatorade.
I see how they do that shit.

2377
02:12:16.801 --> 02:12:17.700
I'm discovery Bro.

2378
02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:23.240
They took a Gatorade thing and you put a lighter fluid in there and you put up

2379
02:12:23.671 --> 02:12:25.830
fucking cop,
cop a battery in there.

2380
02:12:25.831 --> 02:12:29.800
You'll rip it open and you put cold medicine in that motherfucker and who's

2381
02:12:29.801 --> 02:12:34.470
shake that mother fuck up for a few minutes.
Put it in a sock and you snort it.

2382
02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:37.440
Oh my God,
they could.
They can make meth at the fucking house now.

2383
02:12:37.441 --> 02:12:40.500
Who makes met at the fucking house right outside you do it.

2384
02:12:40.740 --> 02:12:42.720
Like I could be in here,
put the chemicals together,
go out to,

2385
02:12:42.721 --> 02:12:45.810
it's called Shaker or whatever the fuck that shit is.
Shake her up man.

2386
02:12:45.870 --> 02:12:46.740
I don't fucking know.

2387
02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:50.920
<v 0>You know that's one of the ways that catch people.
Sometimes it's,</v>

2388
02:12:50.921 --> 02:12:52.120
then they start doing meth.

2389
02:12:52.121 --> 02:12:55.450
They start keeping it at their house and doing crazy shit.
Like one guy,

2390
02:12:55.540 --> 02:12:59.470
I forget the story.
I think,
I believe it was an Esquire,
one of those magazines,

2391
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:04.780
Gq or something like that.
And he was,
uh,
uh,
an attorney.
It's somehow or another,

2392
02:13:04.781 --> 02:13:07.210
he got hooked up with math,
started doing math and the way they caught him,

2393
02:13:07.211 --> 02:13:11.350
he had buckets full of it and his basement just kept it laying around,

2394
02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:13.810
like just made it and kept it there.

2395
02:13:13.811 --> 02:13:16.630
And we'll just like store and Methodist basement didn't even think there's

2396
02:13:16.631 --> 02:13:20.590
anything crazy about storing enough drugs in your fucking house to put you away

2397
02:13:20.591 --> 02:13:22.750
for the rest of your life.
And he did hit him.
It was just like,

2398
02:13:22.970 --> 02:13:26.580
just had it laying around like wasn't even thinking it was just you're,
you're,

2399
02:13:26.590 --> 02:13:30.100
you,
you lose one of the things and when you do the math is that you lose your

2400
02:13:30.101 --> 02:13:33.120
ability to see what's and what's not smart.
Like you just,

2401
02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:36.000
<v 4>you lose that with every drug.
It's just not meant.
Don't blame it on meth.</v>

2402
02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:40.410
Don't blame.
And I met,
met they,
I don't think we lose it with weed.
No,

2403
02:13:40.411 --> 02:13:41.750
but you lose it with the heart.

2404
02:13:42.910 --> 02:13:46.230
You get delirious and get your judgment is fucking foil.

2405
02:13:46.260 --> 02:13:49.440
That's what drugs do to your judgment is fucking off and you catch yourself

2406
02:13:49.441 --> 02:13:52.050
sometimes you're like,
what the fuck did I just do?

2407
02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:56.490
<v 0>Wow.
That's the scary part about sometimes you're like,
what the fuck did I just,</v>

2408
02:13:56.491 --> 02:13:58.440
and that's what a lot of people are looking for,
right?

2409
02:13:58.441 --> 02:14:02.640
A lot of people are looking for this fucking big burst of,
of escape.
You know,

2410
02:14:02.641 --> 02:14:05.310
they're looking for something that just blows the mat or whatever the fuck their

2411
02:14:05.311 --> 02:14:09.570
life is because they're looking to just escape.
They don't like life.

2412
02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:11.040
They don't like it.
They want you die,
man.

2413
02:14:11.041 --> 02:14:14.280
When you get hot and they want to get high to escape,
escape reality,

2414
02:14:14.330 --> 02:14:19.070
<v 4>you know,
man,
we get like your back hurts,
your back hurts,
you hurt your back.</v>

2415
02:14:19.071 --> 02:14:22.070
It fucking hurts,
bro.
You got to go to a doc that,
you know the idea.

2416
02:14:22.071 --> 02:14:25.830
I did a butterfly sweep.
I left my son with on.
The fucking guy landed on my head.

2417
02:14:25.850 --> 02:14:30.740
Oh Gee.
Wow.
My son hurt and swell up.
I think when I needed the drugs,

2418
02:14:30.741 --> 02:14:35.030
he was one of my whole body was in pain and it's not pain that you feel.

2419
02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:36.470
It's just this pain and it's,

2420
02:14:36.990 --> 02:14:37.451
<v 0>well,
it's also,</v>

2421
02:14:37.451 --> 02:14:40.460
you did it for so long when your body became accustomed to using it beginnings.

2422
02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:42.920
<v 4>But in the beginning,
why is the main reason we get down?</v>

2423
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:47.060
Why is the main reason a guy like you and lose you have pain in your life

2424
02:14:47.090 --> 02:14:51.740
growing up?
We all do.
What made you different than not doing it?
You know,

2425
02:14:51.741 --> 02:14:56.030
when you,
uh,
when you first get involved in that,
your body hurts man.

2426
02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:57.141
I kinda,
you know,

2427
02:14:57.141 --> 02:15:02.141
when I was 17 I go home at the end of the night when I was in school,

2428
02:15:02.391 --> 02:15:05.210
I had to go to school at seven 30.
It's not going high school.

2429
02:15:05.211 --> 02:15:08.510
Junior had to go to school and I would come home and sit in the corner in the

2430
02:15:08.511 --> 02:15:12.440
dark with headphones on.
What an eight track.
Black Sabbath.

2431
02:15:12.500 --> 02:15:17.140
And I just do coke till three in the morning.
Is Christ?
No drinking just to cope.

2432
02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:20.570
What possessed you to do that?
Joe wrote,
I don't know.
What's it,

2433
02:15:20.571 --> 02:15:24.260
cause that was a junkie.
No,
I was,
you know what?
I was in so much pain.

2434
02:15:25.030 --> 02:15:29.570
What's it,
but pain covers this huge thing when you're doing drugs.

2435
02:15:30.230 --> 02:15:33.290
Pain could be,
uh,
you know,

2436
02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:36.380
fucking confusion.

2437
02:15:37.730 --> 02:15:41.360
Pain shows up as confusion.
Confusion shows up as pain is what I'm saying to you.

2438
02:15:41.361 --> 02:15:44.300
You confused.
So I was 16.
It could be emotional pain.

2439
02:15:44.450 --> 02:15:46.190
It could be as long as she doesn't have to be physical.

2440
02:15:46.191 --> 02:15:47.990
Whole body's in pain and you're doing it.
You know,

2441
02:15:47.991 --> 02:15:50.740
I talked to the head that I talked to the kid I kidnapped,
you know,

2442
02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:52.970
I call them a lot now.
Wow,
I'm guilty.

2443
02:15:52.971 --> 02:15:56.020
I'm really fucking guilty of that because I saw something when I get knocked

2444
02:15:56.030 --> 02:15:59.000
them that it's not Joe Diaz.
I saw him suffering.

2445
02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:01.730
I saw him at one moment on the floor,
handcuffed.

2446
02:16:02.210 --> 02:16:04.190
And I would never want that to me.
You know what I'm saying?

2447
02:16:04.190 --> 02:16:06.950
Like I always dreaded that happens to a friend of mine for what I did.

2448
02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:08.450
And I always felt bad.

2449
02:16:08.451 --> 02:16:12.410
I had him call on the podcast and I apologize to them and I always call him up

2450
02:16:12.411 --> 02:16:15.020
and I called him the other day and we were talking and they told me,
you know,

2451
02:16:15.050 --> 02:16:17.510
every time I talk to him,
he tells me more about his life,
Bro.

2452
02:16:17.930 --> 02:16:19.790
You know what happened since I kidnapped them.

2453
02:16:20.150 --> 02:16:22.910
I bumped into him in [inaudible] 94.
I kidnapped them and 87,

2454
02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:25.490
I bumped into him in [inaudible] 94 and I bought coke from him.

2455
02:16:26.570 --> 02:16:30.640
He was all fucked up.
It's at,
uh,
at pro street down in boulder.

2456
02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:33.010
And then he never remembered.
I think he blacked out.

2457
02:16:33.011 --> 02:16:36.640
That's how bad a shape he was.
And I asked him the last,
not this time,

2458
02:16:36.641 --> 02:16:39.310
but at the time before I asked him,
do you remember me buying blow from you?

2459
02:16:39.610 --> 02:16:42.040
He goes,
I remember seeing it.
I remember hating you the next day.

2460
02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:46.030
I believe I didn't knock you the fuck out because I caught him off guard.

2461
02:16:46.031 --> 02:16:48.420
He was at a bar all fucked up.
I'm like,
God saw me some blogs.

2462
02:16:48.430 --> 02:16:52.630
Like I look who's here,
the guy who kidnapped me,
the guy who could that me,

2463
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:57.570
but I called him like he kidnapped him in before you apologize for kidnapping

2464
02:16:57.571 --> 02:16:58.960
next year later you guys,
Wellman,

2465
02:16:59.290 --> 02:17:02.670
I saw him at a bar and Pro Street and you even say,
I'm sorry I kidnapped her.

2466
02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:03.513
Not that night.

2467
02:17:04.030 --> 02:17:07.690
I just gave him a hug and asked him if he knew where I get some blow and shit.

2468
02:17:08.050 --> 02:17:11.500
Not that night he gave me a hug and I always go on the bottom and when I

2469
02:17:11.501 --> 02:17:13.550
apologize,
that felt really bad.
And I talked to him,

2470
02:17:13.551 --> 02:17:17.440
he and Danny and he started telling me he's 50 he was,
it was mother.

2471
02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:20.350
He had a heart attack,
you know,

2472
02:17:20.351 --> 02:17:23.140
I could tell when I talked to him and then his pictures on Facebook that he had

2473
02:17:23.141 --> 02:17:26.270
a stroke,
you know,
that was off from the blow bro.

2474
02:17:26.410 --> 02:17:29.290
Sometimes when he calls me in and I could tell he's drinking,
you know,

2475
02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:33.460
and sometimes I feel real guilty that I do this,
but then,
you know,

2476
02:17:33.490 --> 02:17:35.440
I'm the type of guy,
I don't play that shit.
You know,

2477
02:17:35.470 --> 02:17:38.110
I don't play that shit at all.
He was fucked up when I get in that though,

2478
02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:42.440
a couple of weeks before,
you know how we got,

2479
02:17:42.441 --> 02:17:46.360
how this whole thing started was because he got a Dui fucked up some cars,

2480
02:17:46.660 --> 02:17:49.920
went to bold the hospital on North Hospital,
boulder general.

2481
02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:52.810
And while he was in there,
you know,
boulder,
he was hurt.

2482
02:17:52.811 --> 02:17:54.690
They left them in a room by himself and he stole a bottle,

2483
02:17:54.710 --> 02:17:57.520
liquid coke cans and jumped out the window.
Okay.

2484
02:17:57.521 --> 02:18:00.640
And they called them an hour later on the other side of the boat when you steal

2485
02:18:00.641 --> 02:18:03.640
a bottle of liquor,
cocaine from the hospital,
you already got pro.
I'm like,

2486
02:18:03.670 --> 02:18:07.360
God kidnapping him,
you know,
and we laugh and we giggle.
Meet kidnapping him.

2487
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:10.410
It makes me feel like maybe I contribute to that,
but I didn't.

2488
02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:14.290
He had his own doom.
Why didn't I get fucked up?
You know?
I mean,

2489
02:18:14.291 --> 02:18:15.730
I got fucked up in different ways.

2490
02:18:15.731 --> 02:18:19.540
I paid in different ways because the guilt in me doing that to a man fucking

2491
02:18:19.541 --> 02:18:22.450
destroyed me.
You know,
I like to fuck around.
You know,

2492
02:18:22.451 --> 02:18:26.140
I could do something bad if somebody harms me.
But even with Jujitsu,

2493
02:18:26.141 --> 02:18:28.630
I just can't put my forum in some of these face man.

2494
02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:31.340
I hate when I have to lay on somebody.
Like I'll check on them and go,

2495
02:18:31.341 --> 02:18:34.630
are you okay bro?
You know I love you right now.
Look at me.
No,
I know.

2496
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:38.860
You know it's funny.
So for me,
seeing him in that corner,

2497
02:18:38.861 --> 02:18:42.380
I always had that guilt that I tied him up show it's fucking scary when,

2498
02:18:42.390 --> 02:18:45.910
well it seems like that was the life you were both living,
you know now that,
yes,

2499
02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:46.680
yes.

2500
02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:48.990
<v 0>Apologize.
And you know,
you,
you,
you,
you were on,</v>

2501
02:18:49.020 --> 02:18:50.940
you're both on a fucking crazy path.

2502
02:18:51.410 --> 02:18:54.360
You know the fucking eighties the eighties that's what it was.

2503
02:18:54.361 --> 02:18:58.560
I assist all those movies.
They're writing,
dodged,
all that stuff.

2504
02:18:58.890 --> 02:19:03.510
I dodged all that stuff.
Cause the 80s were my period of athletic competition.

2505
02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:08.540
It was all hibernation from 81 to 88 all I did was taekwondo.

2506
02:19:08.850 --> 02:19:10.740
That's all I did.
February dodged at all.

2507
02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:14.930
<v 4>February,
1919 79 was the day my life went down.
You know why?</v>

2508
02:19:15.260 --> 02:19:19.490
Why I got my one,
uh,
I want to form in a karate tournament.
I was a purple belt.

2509
02:19:20.090 --> 02:19:22.070
I was in the eighth grade and I lost the fighting.

2510
02:19:22.071 --> 02:19:25.850
I got disqualified for kicking above the fucking face.
You were really young.

2511
02:19:25.851 --> 02:19:28.280
How old were you?
I was 13 or 14.

2512
02:19:28.281 --> 02:19:32.450
It was semi contact and I got out of Goshen route karate and you know,

2513
02:19:32.630 --> 02:19:33.620
I liked those guys.

2514
02:19:33.621 --> 02:19:36.290
That's why I missed that whole thing because on the weekends we just got a

2515
02:19:36.291 --> 02:19:37.460
different fucking tournament's.

2516
02:19:37.461 --> 02:19:39.920
You know when you do that and as a kid you just go to different tournament's.

2517
02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:42.650
On Saturdays we would all geek out and go to Honda.

2518
02:19:42.980 --> 02:19:45.920
You know what a Honda is in New York?
That's a big martial art supplies.

2519
02:19:46.370 --> 02:19:51.370
I would geek out nail like I Kabuto Topfers I get the fucking things that you

2520
02:19:53.541 --> 02:19:55.820
could punch the Maki Juarez.

2521
02:19:56.030 --> 02:20:00.530
I had to fucking the fucking that technique fucking thing.

2522
02:20:00.860 --> 02:20:03.830
The juice you put on your palms,
I was the real deal,
you know,

2523
02:20:04.090 --> 02:20:05.420
that was watching Chinese connection.

2524
02:20:05.421 --> 02:20:08.420
When was the last time you want Chinese guy tonight when everybody goes to
sleep,

2525
02:20:08.421 --> 02:20:09.770
put on Bruce Lee's second movie.

2526
02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:15.040
Do me that favor goopy that fucking favor and you're going to see what fucking

2527
02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:17.540
unreal is.
Poke some Bruce Lee.

2528
02:20:17.640 --> 02:20:21.050
You're going to see the last scene of Chinese connection.

2529
02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:25.040
The last scene when he goes into the school,
listen to what he says.

2530
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:28.790
Remember Chinese connection is a,
is kind of a rip off of Spaghetti Westerns.

2531
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:31.370
If you watch those three movies Clay's with made in Italy,

2532
02:20:31.610 --> 02:20:35.960
there's so far we've gone like you haven't watched them in 20 years watching the

2533
02:20:35.961 --> 02:20:39.590
good,
the bad,
and yet what's the tiny paint?
The town red.
I don't remember that.

2534
02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:43.430
That was crazy.
That was a great movie.
Great movie.
And back as a ghost story.

2535
02:20:43.470 --> 02:20:45.230
He was a ghost story and Chinese connection.

2536
02:20:45.380 --> 02:20:48.740
He comes back as a student that they killed his teacher and he Avengers is

2537
02:20:48.741 --> 02:20:53.630
teacher and it just the new chuck scene and the Chinese collection when he first

2538
02:20:53.631 --> 02:20:57.680
attached to school,
when he goes in and he goes,
I'm allowing you to leave.

2539
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:59.990
Who allows you to leave.
Even in Bronx Tale,

2540
02:20:59.991 --> 02:21:01.820
they lock the fucking door and they wouldn't let the bike is.

2541
02:21:01.821 --> 02:21:05.360
Leave this right here.
Look at it.
Changed America forever.

2542
02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:09.320
This was 1970 look at this guys,
watch this.

2543
02:21:09.530 --> 02:21:12.410
I still remember the fucking commercial for this.
The trailer.

2544
02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:14.840
Look at how slow and methodical

2545
02:21:15.350 --> 02:21:19.740
<v 10>they're all fucking jacket off.
Look at this man.
Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2546
02:21:20.040 --> 02:21:20.873
look at him

2547
02:21:22.750 --> 02:21:27.150
and they all with Steve McQueen had and Steve Mcqueen one when he had you

2548
02:21:27.151 --> 02:21:28.860
talking about his forearms,

2549
02:21:29.070 --> 02:21:32.730
this guy's clothes or seven times the size of a man and nobody had ever seen

2550
02:21:32.731 --> 02:21:37.200
anybody kicking.
Looking at four 1970 nobody ever seen nothing like this.

2551
02:21:37.470 --> 02:21:41.370
I remember being in Catholic school at sacred heart school for boys and seeing

2552
02:21:41.371 --> 02:21:44.530
this and losing my fucking mind,
but this is nothing.

2553
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:47.310
I'm going to show you the scene with James American forever,
right here.

2554
02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:50.400
The double points for both of them right here.
Bam,
right here.

2555
02:21:50.401 --> 02:21:52.980
This changed America forever,
right here.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2556
02:21:55.820 --> 02:22:00.720
that Double Park.
Nobody's ever done that,
right?
Yes.
When they say,

2557
02:22:00.721 --> 02:22:04.630
why,
why,
why?
I says,
Joe Rogan,
this is all beauty.

2558
02:22:05.490 --> 02:22:09.400
This will never happen again,
but you can see

2559
02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:18.660
this was going to America for oh one guy hit him in the back.

2560
02:22:18.660 --> 02:22:22.260
This is what America pays forever.
Right here.

2561
02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:26.700
Guy fucked up and kicked him in the back room.
That mean it's looking at it.

2562
02:22:27.220 --> 02:22:32.220
It was 1970 nobody had ever seen before that nobody

2563
02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:39.510
that shit.

2564
02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:42.240
How many times do you hit yourself in the back of the head?

2565
02:22:43.350 --> 02:22:45.210
Back of my head were bruises.
Fuck.

2566
02:22:45.900 --> 02:22:49.970
I've probably have more PTSD from getting hit in the head by my own nunchucks

2567
02:22:50.030 --> 02:22:54.720
and never getting punched or kicked.
I would crack myself,
man,
fucking hard.

2568
02:22:54.870 --> 02:22:59.520
Those Coco Bolo ones from centrally martial arts supply,
Coco Bolo,

2569
02:22:59.521 --> 02:23:01.790
nunchucks they were fucking like a pound each.

2570
02:23:01.810 --> 02:23:05.310
They bounce off the back of your head.
I still feel knots in my head.

2571
02:23:06.930 --> 02:23:09.120
I still feel knots in bag in my head from where

2572
02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:14.880
I was doing it wrong.
You're supposed to go up and catch it behind you,

2573
02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:19.040
but I was going this way and catching it like that.
I was kidding.

2574
02:23:19.350 --> 02:23:20.990
I didn't know what I was doing.
I was ad libbing,

2575
02:23:21.450 --> 02:23:24.660
whacking myself in the back of the head,
just going,
oh fuck.

2576
02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:28.820
<v 4>And then right back to it.
This is just as just as too much.</v>

2577
02:23:28.850 --> 02:23:32.290
I remember still going back to school that Monday and kids will lose me.

2578
02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:34.540
I still remember the drive in theater.
I strongly set.

2579
02:23:34.900 --> 02:23:37.900
We'll put that final fight scene because that's one of the greatest,

2580
02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:42.100
he jumps over a table and flying psychics and motherfucker,
no stocks,
no nothing.

2581
02:23:42.620 --> 02:23:45.830
He gets the soil,
it takes a guy born.
He fights.
This is the end.

2582
02:23:45.831 --> 02:23:47.040
This is the end when they're going to kill him.

2583
02:23:47.300 --> 02:23:49.800
<v 10>Look at Bruce Fleet and he just stands there looking at me.</v>

2584
02:23:49.810 --> 02:23:53.120
He fucking just runs out of its before he single handedly

2585
02:23:53.170 --> 02:23:54.730
<v 0>made being Chinese sexy.</v>

2586
02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:58.770
<v 4>Don Don,
Don,
Don,
Don,
Don,
Don,
Don.
Ah,</v>

2587
02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:03.780
that's the song on,
ah,
ah,
this is my life dog.

2588
02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:10.310
<v 10>Midnight,
go fucking midnight.
We'd
just just,</v>

2589
02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:12.390
this is just too much.
Yeah.
I don't think anybody

2590
02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:16.020
<v 0>day can realize what an impact that guy had on kids.</v>

2591
02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:20.490
I was living in Newark and I was at an apartment building and the superintendent

2592
02:24:20.491 --> 02:24:22.800
of the building,
his kid was my age.
I used to go over his house.

2593
02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:25.590
That's how I found out about Bruce Lee hit him in his,

2594
02:24:25.650 --> 02:24:28.830
he had an older brother and they were really into Bruce Lee and they were a,

2595
02:24:28.831 --> 02:24:31.410
you know,
yeah,
like Bruce Lee posters and shit,
and I was like,
Whoa,

2596
02:24:31.411 --> 02:24:34.710
what is this Bruce Lee's chef here you guys are into?
And then from there,

2597
02:24:34.711 --> 02:24:37.650
I'm pretty sure we went to see a movie together.
I think we went with his dad.

2598
02:24:37.950 --> 02:24:39.480
That was the first time I was exposed to it.

2599
02:24:39.481 --> 02:24:42.190
I was like maybe five or six and I was like,
oh my God.

2600
02:24:42.350 --> 02:24:44.820
<v 4>He taught this country so many fucking things at the time,</v>

2601
02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:46.920
like people would just,
you know,
it made everybody,

2602
02:24:47.580 --> 02:24:52.320
but it even strengthened like rebellious.
Like if you watch enter the dragon,

2603
02:24:52.770 --> 02:24:55.910
there's a partner that you never caught this appointment to a dragon with.

2604
02:24:55.911 --> 02:24:59.360
A guy comes in Bob Wall and he goes,
I know Bob.
I know,
you know.

2605
02:24:59.390 --> 02:25:02.400
I didn't know Bob too.
He goes,
you must attend the morning ritual,
one uniform,

2606
02:25:03.330 --> 02:25:04.620
which he tells him outside.

2607
02:25:04.621 --> 02:25:07.860
He throws the punches and shit and the next day he's dressed in white.

2608
02:25:07.890 --> 02:25:09.420
Think about that.
Everybody had a gian.

2609
02:25:09.870 --> 02:25:12.780
Bruce Lee refused to wear a fucking gate and he wasn't at his grandfather.

2610
02:25:13.050 --> 02:25:15.060
He just refused to wear a fucking g.

2611
02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:17.910
That's the kind of mentality you put in these kids.

2612
02:25:18.090 --> 02:25:19.530
That's why these kids are getting bits lab.

2613
02:25:19.710 --> 02:25:22.410
Do you think of Bruce Lee was around Kolache people be getting bullied.

2614
02:25:22.410 --> 02:25:25.480
Nobody got bullied when I was a kid because you watch Bruce Lee,
Bro,

2615
02:25:25.481 --> 02:25:27.070
he gave you fucking balls.

2616
02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:29.360
Would you please put that last thing you ever got bullied?

2617
02:25:29.361 --> 02:25:31.050
What are you talking about?
This still got bullied.

2618
02:25:31.060 --> 02:25:35.170
Think have a bullied by people who are trying to find connection at fire.

2619
02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:36.830
Fight scene in the end.
Trust me,
it's on the,

2620
02:25:36.831 --> 02:25:38.380
I just watched it the other day on Youtube.

2621
02:25:38.710 --> 02:25:43.390
I was watching this shit the other day crying.
This is tremendous,

2622
02:25:43.391 --> 02:25:47.200
but it's hard to look back when you look back at that and see the kind of impact

2623
02:25:47.201 --> 02:25:48.940
that hat at the time.
It's just,

2624
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:51.970
it's hard to wrap your head around it because nobody had ever seen anything like

2625
02:25:51.971 --> 02:25:55.180
that before.
There had been no karate movies and all of a sudden,

2626
02:25:55.181 --> 02:25:56.560
I mean maybe there was a couple,

2627
02:25:56.561 --> 02:25:58.930
but it was nothing like five fingers of death came out.

2628
02:25:58.930 --> 02:26:02.420
There was like a two or three then this guy and faded and the beauty of this
was,

2629
02:26:02.421 --> 02:26:07.270
and I told us I want to Ari's story tellers that especially for me dog,
you know,

2630
02:26:07.660 --> 02:26:11.230
before Bruce Lee,
everybody was walked Chinese people especially walking around,

2631
02:26:11.231 --> 02:26:13.650
they were the help pro.
They would have fucking help.

2632
02:26:13.660 --> 02:26:17.180
They walked around half retarded.
We came out,
Bruce,

2633
02:26:17.181 --> 02:26:19.390
they were ironing shirts and bowing and motherfuckers,

2634
02:26:19.690 --> 02:26:22.810
Bruce Lee came out and gave them this inner strength.
But for me,

2635
02:26:22.811 --> 02:26:24.880
I wasn't Chinese,
I was Cuban,
I was an immigrant.

2636
02:26:24.881 --> 02:26:28.630
I knew what it was to walk around feeling like you were number two.
So for me,

2637
02:26:28.631 --> 02:26:32.140
he fucking strengthened my head just watching that shit like that Chinese

2638
02:26:32.141 --> 02:26:33.290
motherfucker do.
Dude,
I could do it.

2639
02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:36.640
Then my stepfather would come home cause I used to go to karate and my

2640
02:26:36.650 --> 02:26:38.740
stepfather go,
what'd you learn today?
And I teach them and he'd go,

2641
02:26:38.741 --> 02:26:42.700
don't work on me.
And I go,
what the fuck?
You know what I'm saying?

2642
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:46.190
It just worked at the karate school and don't work here.
And he would tell him,

2643
02:26:46.191 --> 02:26:48.850
you know I don't work cause I smacked the shit out of Bruce Lee and Cuba one

2644
02:26:48.851 --> 02:26:51.020
time and I believe him.
He would tell him that,

2645
02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:54.820
fuck Bruce Lee at one time on the corner and Cube I bit slap met that Chinese.

2646
02:26:54.821 --> 02:26:58.390
He was bullshitting me.
The man,
my mother would tell me Batman was a Faggot,

2647
02:26:58.870 --> 02:27:03.120
you know shit like that.
There's this scene that's it.

2648
02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:07.540
You got to speed it up a little bit more but what?
Fuck it,
we'll take that too.

2649
02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:09.063
What's this one?

2650
02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:14.120
He was also the first guy that was like really shredded like that in movies

2651
02:27:14.121 --> 02:27:17.780
where it taking place.
There's when he fights,
misses a Zukie.

2652
02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:21.320
This is what the sword,
look at this guys,
this is just tremendous.

2653
02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.370
Was there ever a guy that was like shirtless and movies?

2654
02:27:25.371 --> 02:27:30.020
It was flexing beforehand.
Was that a thing?
Because the guy was ripped Hercules.

2655
02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:33.380
Yeah,
but not like a fighter guy.
Right.
Tarzan.
Tarzan.

2656
02:27:33.381 --> 02:27:37.910
Because everything else was after like a hard times Bronson.
That was much later.

2657
02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Right?
Oh,
look at this fight.
Look at his fight here.
Pharaoh,
Pharaoh.
But no,

2658
02:27:43.370 --> 02:27:44.810
just play this fight off the Joe.

2659
02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:48.140
There's one scene in here where you look at him and you go,
well,

2660
02:27:48.170 --> 02:27:50.480
you know why he couldn't be fake,
but look at his hand speed.

2661
02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:53.210
There wasn't no speedups and filming this.
There wasn't nothing.

2662
02:27:53.540 --> 02:27:56.660
This fight with this guy I think was a Russian that was coming to visit him,

2663
02:27:57.770 --> 02:28:01.040
but this is just tremendous hole from the fucking time he walks in.

2664
02:28:01.070 --> 02:28:05.960
It's a 20 minute fight.
The first movie does is a spinning elbow front.
Kate,

2665
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:10.190
who does that?
So he walked,
he walked in.
There was two.
Jack is this right here?

2666
02:28:10.191 --> 02:28:13.940
We get to see it right here before that.
He goes like this.
He walks out.
You got,

2667
02:28:13.970 --> 02:28:15.020
you got to get to the microphone.

2668
02:28:15.021 --> 02:28:19.540
Man Kicks Him.

2669
02:28:19.730 --> 02:28:21.950
They don't do that shit no more.
They don't do that shit.

2670
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:23.450
<v 10>Put that.
I didn't even hear what you said.</v>

2671
02:28:23.930 --> 02:28:26.160
He's playing the sound and you're talking shit.

2672
02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:30.153
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2673
02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:34.130
<v 10>Oh my God.
That guy.
The white belt.
What's his,
what's his handling?
Watch his feet.</v>

2674
02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:39.050
Watch his fucking speed dog.
This is 1970 there was no speed up films.

2675
02:28:39.051 --> 02:28:41.420
It's also the sounds that he made but crazy.

2676
02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:47.720
Don't play that music friend.
What's your spinning?
What's this?

2677
02:28:48.630 --> 02:28:53.230
Are you fucking kidding me?
Pressing questions.
Bam.
This motherfucker stand now.

2678
02:28:53.231 --> 02:28:58.160
This fight scene by [inaudible] that the movie theaters at my boys and we

2679
02:28:58.161 --> 02:29:00.200
watched it and then we go next door to mark was dishonest.

2680
02:29:00.370 --> 02:29:02.220
<v 11>Glutamine.
Knock all the fucking food plots.</v>

2681
02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:07.500
<v 10>Oh look,
I got him in the arm up bro.
This is real.
This is 20th Oh my God.</v>

2682
02:29:07.590 --> 02:29:11.600
Bruce Lee.
He fucked up.
I think I had any technique.
What do you really fight him?

2683
02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:16.050
He let go because of a bite.
He bit him in the fucking ankle real fucking hard.

2684
02:29:16.051 --> 02:29:20.130
That was good arm bar technique for 1970 or whatever it was.
What year was this?

2685
02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:22.560
Just came out?
This was the original heroin movie.

2686
02:29:22.561 --> 02:29:25.390
Just came out like a 70 look at him.
Go

2687
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:27.770
<v 11>transcend this motherfucker with his hands.</v>

2688
02:29:28.250 --> 02:29:31.260
If you haven't watched the challenge connection,
you'll fuck it up.
And he's like,

2689
02:29:31.730 --> 02:29:35.360
Steve Mcqueen every 10 minutes because he's really angry in this movie because

2690
02:29:35.361 --> 02:29:37.170
they killed his teacher.
He's fucking them up.

2691
02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:38.720
<v 10>Baula hate in this fucking movie.</v>

2692
02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:41.840
Who's on the phone with Steve Mcqueen who were sleep?
You mean talking to them?

2693
02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:45.140
Telling them what do I do?
Maxim the fuck up.
But watch this.

2694
02:29:45.141 --> 02:29:47.420
This is a Steve McQueen's in the movie.
Is that what you're saying?
Boom.

2695
02:29:47.430 --> 02:29:52.070
Bow is buses.
Joe Rogan.
Watch this.
Joe Rogan.
Oh,

2696
02:29:52.130 --> 02:29:56.060
come on now.
That guy just ate a wheel kick.
This is unrealistic.

2697
02:29:56.900 --> 02:30:01.130
It's sat quick.
But if guy,
when you get wheel kicking their face,
dude,

2698
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:09.350
this is awesome though.
This is tremendous.
You saw this still good.
Wait,
wait,

2699
02:30:09.410 --> 02:30:12.630
wait,
wait.
This fucking seat.
This is just too much.
You know?
Look,

2700
02:30:13.970 --> 02:30:18.680
his technique is really fucking good.
It's really good to this day.
I mean,

2701
02:30:18.681 --> 02:30:23.630
it's hard to see someone do martial arts from back then and compare it to what

2702
02:30:23.631 --> 02:30:27.950
you see today.
But Bruce Lee compares.
It's really good kicking technique,
man.

2703
02:30:28.730 --> 02:30:32.480
Like his side.
Kick it straight.
He's not kicking.
His hip comes up,

2704
02:30:32.780 --> 02:30:33.613
it goes straight.

2705
02:30:33.980 --> 02:30:34.880
<v 4>That's where it gets good.</v>

2706
02:30:36.730 --> 02:30:40.300
<v 10>Fuck this mother.
Fuck up right now for Joe Rogan.
Suzuki.</v>

2707
02:30:40.310 --> 02:30:45.160
Why is this Joe Rogan watch this?
Watch this dog.
Old School.

2708
02:30:45.490 --> 02:30:48.470
Old School.
Old School.
Fuck the

2709
02:30:51.870 --> 02:30:56.500
fuck God.
He makes it crazy.
Scream when he karate fucking,

2710
02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:57.990
he goes out.
Zukie

2711
02:30:58.230 --> 02:31:02.790
<v 4>he fucks up Suzuki.
Then he goes back to his school and they tell him,
you know,</v>

2712
02:31:02.791 --> 02:31:05.460
you gotta go do some time and he fucking grabs the guy and he goes,
listen,

2713
02:31:05.461 --> 02:31:08.490
don't touch my school.
I'll fuck you up.
Then he walks outside.

2714
02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:10.860
He agreed to do time.
This is the beauty about Bruce Lee.

2715
02:31:10.861 --> 02:31:15.690
He's agreed to do the time.
He walks out and he opens a door on there.

2716
02:31:15.691 --> 02:31:17.430
All that is,
shoot him.
That's the scene you see.

2717
02:31:17.940 --> 02:31:20.470
He could have turned around and away.
That motherfucker looked at them,

2718
02:31:20.471 --> 02:31:23.780
yelled and ran out until the audience and it ends with him doing the fly psychic

2719
02:31:23.790 --> 02:31:26.070
and you hear the bullets going off and you're just ready to go.

2720
02:31:26.071 --> 02:31:29.610
Kill somebody at that point.
[inaudible]

2721
02:31:30.940 --> 02:31:35.400
I'm fucking somebody up to that.
And that's how he left you off.
That was it.

2722
02:31:35.550 --> 02:31:39.710
And then return of the dragon came out with Chuck Norris and that was kind of
Ah,

2723
02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:42.150
people bad time.
He,
no,
he didn't die yet.

2724
02:31:42.180 --> 02:31:46.620
Enter the dragon came out July of 73 and he was dead.
Maybe a week later.

2725
02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:48.960
He died a week after that until the dragon came out.

2726
02:31:49.260 --> 02:31:53.640
He died July something [inaudible] 73 so I was 10 let me tell you something.

2727
02:31:53.641 --> 02:31:54.211
When he died,

2728
02:31:54.211 --> 02:31:57.330
you have no idea what this country was like because there was no internet.

2729
02:31:57.331 --> 02:32:00.120
You had to find out by going to Chinatown.
That was the proof.

2730
02:32:00.140 --> 02:32:03.330
You got to go to Chinatown and buy the magazines and they showed you the black

2731
02:32:03.331 --> 02:32:05.850
and white pictures of him carrying him and his wake,

2732
02:32:05.851 --> 02:32:09.660
Kareem Abdul Jabbar and James Cobra.
And it wasn't,
there was no newspaper.

2733
02:32:09.661 --> 02:32:11.970
Nobody cared about some Chinese guy that was,

2734
02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:15.570
we didn't find that to a month after he died that they sent us a letter by the

2735
02:32:15.571 --> 02:32:16.130
fucking it up

2736
02:32:16.130 --> 02:32:19.100
<v 5>bottle with a note.
You know what's really fascinating about him,
man,</v>

2737
02:32:19.101 --> 02:32:23.540
he made his movies and all of his like scenes with these wild kicks and jumping

2738
02:32:23.541 --> 02:32:24.440
fighting techniques,

2739
02:32:24.830 --> 02:32:29.310
but in real life when he practiced martial arts for fighting for,

2740
02:32:29.620 --> 02:32:30.890
he never did any of that stuff.

2741
02:32:31.070 --> 02:32:35.180
He concentrated on like low kicks and punches and boxing techniques mixed with

2742
02:32:35.181 --> 02:32:36.170
wrestling techniques,

2743
02:32:36.380 --> 02:32:40.000
but he just knew that it would be spectacular looking spectacular.
Yeah,

2744
02:32:40.001 --> 02:32:42.470
it was guy was 30 years ahead of his time guy he really wanted,

2745
02:32:42.471 --> 02:32:45.980
he'd get to society what he did to the film industry.
What he did,

2746
02:32:45.981 --> 02:32:47.810
he brought something that was just brilliant

2747
02:32:48.180 --> 02:32:50.550
<v 4>and then you watch anther drag them and they just cashed them up.</v>

2748
02:32:51.390 --> 02:32:52.140
They just so listen,

2749
02:32:52.140 --> 02:32:54.960
you come back with us and then the Chinese people got mad and that was heroin

2750
02:32:54.961 --> 02:32:58.310
money.
They made those movies for $10 in Thailand or would have fucked him.

2751
02:32:58.440 --> 02:33:00.270
<v 5>So he had some sort of crazy,</v>

2752
02:33:00.271 --> 02:33:03.480
there's some crazy conspiracy theory about his death that it was absolutely

2753
02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:07.210
Chinese mob that killed him because he owed money and so money,

2754
02:33:07.460 --> 02:33:09.720
he just took money out of their pocket.
When he left,

2755
02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:12.280
he went out with a born abroad.
You think that's what happened?
Did they kill him?

2756
02:33:12.281 --> 02:33:14.670
What happened really would make them barrels and money.

2757
02:33:14.671 --> 02:33:17.550
How much money do you think the Chinese connection cost to shoot?

2758
02:33:17.730 --> 02:33:19.770
What they think they paid those Thailand people?
Well,

2759
02:33:19.771 --> 02:33:24.290
it's kind of crazy when you find out that his son died as well and died because

2760
02:33:24.300 --> 02:33:27.570
there was a bullet in a gun was supposed to be a blank gun or it had a piece in

2761
02:33:27.571 --> 02:33:29.430
it or something like that.
There's something in it will never fuck.

2762
02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:33.000
But if you were thinking like that,
some really crazy,

2763
02:33:33.001 --> 02:33:37.170
really rich Chinese gangster guy won his son dead as well.

2764
02:33:37.170 --> 02:33:40.920
Some real old school Kangaskhan type shit.
Kill the man and then,

2765
02:33:40.921 --> 02:33:44.100
and then put a hit on his son and that,
that's how it went down.
I mean,

2766
02:33:44.130 --> 02:33:46.200
I don't know what happened to him.
I don't know.

2767
02:33:46.201 --> 02:33:50.070
But that's always been the conspiracy theory.
It's people,
you know,

2768
02:33:50.250 --> 02:33:54.410
people love those kinds of crazy stories.
They love the crank.
Crazy story of,
uh,

2769
02:33:54.550 --> 02:33:54.840
you know,

2770
02:33:54.840 --> 02:33:59.100
a curse on him or I never thought about Milk Kirsch or the Samurai touched his

2771
02:33:59.101 --> 02:34:03.960
back like any shit,
Sam.
I trust him with the murder of touch,

2772
02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:07.270
but it is crazy.
When we got a blood clot,
Brandon me was killed.

2773
02:34:08.110 --> 02:34:09.090
This was my philosophy.

2774
02:34:10.050 --> 02:34:12.930
<v 4>The Dea never talks about heroin coming from Chinese.</v>

2775
02:34:12.931 --> 02:34:15.720
Chinese been bringing heroin into this country since Jesus loves Chicago,

2776
02:34:16.050 --> 02:34:18.010
but they're that smart.
Yeah,
that's

2777
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:20.530
<v 5>smart.
They don't flaunt it.
When you see a Chinese restaurant,
what do you see?</v>

2778
02:34:20.531 --> 02:34:21.331
You see 50 people.

2779
02:34:21.331 --> 02:34:24.260
When you see white people in their server and not the whole family's in there.

2780
02:34:24.261 --> 02:34:25.960
When you to a good Chinese restaurant,
what do you see?

2781
02:34:26.260 --> 02:34:28.630
You see the kid and the two kids doing homework at the table.

2782
02:34:29.240 --> 02:34:31.450
The whole family runs it.
They all move in together.

2783
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:34.750
They all do all that shifts so they know they're not Puerto Ricans broke and not

2784
02:34:34.780 --> 02:34:38.410
fucking Italians that buy a Lincoln continental,
look at me.

2785
02:34:38.411 --> 02:34:41.230
They can keep it low that they never could get busted.

2786
02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:44.910
They have such a great system.
The triads,
those Chinese gangsters.

2787
02:34:45.170 --> 02:34:48.910
Remember that the mafia concept is not Italian.
It's Chinese.

2788
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:52.780
It's Chai fucking knees.
So Spaghetti,
well I don't know about snow.

2789
02:34:52.781 --> 02:34:56.500
That oodles noodles came from China.
They brought her to Italy.

2790
02:34:56.501 --> 02:34:59.800
The Italians came over to China,
found noodles,
brought it back to Italy and said,

2791
02:34:59.830 --> 02:35:03.320
oh we made me and balmy mix.
We got feathers.

2792
02:35:03.321 --> 02:35:04.990
I'm trying to power.

2793
02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:08.560
So I think that they made all this money in China,

2794
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:09.760
wherever they made these movies.

2795
02:35:09.761 --> 02:35:14.020
Cause after that the producers of him or run one shore and Raymond Chow,

2796
02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:17.830
Raymond chapter,
briefly die.
Rehmann shop became a break partner Warner brothers.

2797
02:35:17.831 --> 02:35:22.280
In fact,
he produced a bunch of a Charles Bronson movies.
Wow.

2798
02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:23.381
Do you understand me?

2799
02:35:23.381 --> 02:35:25.990
So there was a lot of Kinky shit going on and then 30 years later they killed

2800
02:35:25.991 --> 02:35:29.500
his son.
If you watch godfather two what does he do?
He kills the fucking son's.

2801
02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:33.370
He lets veto live.
Vito goes back to the United States,
gets powered cars back,

2802
02:35:35.710 --> 02:35:39.960
bye bye.
And turn the machine on Tuesday.

2803
02:35:41.260 --> 02:35:44.450
They're not going to stick.
Those are good for you out of your or salmon flights,

2804
02:35:44.550 --> 02:35:48.910
bro.
He knows.
Go to a doctor,
a salmon.
I did a little bear fart.

2805
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:52.070
It's terrible arts.
A bear forest in your face and you don't have to turn it.

2806
02:35:52.100 --> 02:35:53.050
I'm really just sit down.

2807
02:35:53.550 --> 02:35:56.590
That's the core with some emphasis protein in that motherfucker.

2808
02:35:57.500 --> 02:36:00.550
Oh,

2816
02:36:22.211 --> 02:36:24.210
