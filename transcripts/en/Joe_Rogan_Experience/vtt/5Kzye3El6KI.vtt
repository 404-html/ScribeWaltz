00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches in some something that's like a,</v>

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:05.610
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.680
<v Speaker 1>I came in here and remember I got,</v>

5
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>had gotten sick and I had to postpone on you.</v>

6
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.223
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.950
<v Speaker 1>and anyways I went to a hospital down in uh,</v>

8
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>or up in Valencia I think,</v>

9
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>and they had thrown me in a room for three hours and they were thinking about</v>

10
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>getting Hazmat suits out and all this stuff because I thought you might've had</v>

11
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:26.260
<v Speaker 1>ebola because you came back from Africa,</v>

12
00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:26.821
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

15
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>right after the Ebola crisis,</v>

16
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:28.771
<v Speaker 1>but it had been,</v>

17
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:29.604
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I had been back for like two months or something or maybe even close to three</v>

19
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.030
<v Speaker 1>and a.</v>

20
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.571
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

21
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>they were going all crazy and stuff.</v>

22
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>And this is just a stat that I like to sum that grips my heart.</v>

23
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:45.690
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I want to say it now.</v>

24
00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:45.930
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

25
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.763
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

27
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I think I looked it up right before I got in,</v>

28
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>in here and it was around 11,000 people that have bullet took,</v>

29
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.230
<v Speaker 1>took out 11,000 people.</v>

30
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>That's a ton.</v>

31
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.731
<v Speaker 1>It's a ton.</v>

32
00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a brutal crisis.</v>

33
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>But I just remember the uproar that,</v>

34
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>that in the fear,</v>

35
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.561
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

36
00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:08.060
<v Speaker 1>the outcry that happened publicly all over the United States and only a couple</v>

37
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>people got it here and then,</v>

38
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.551
<v Speaker 1>and still,</v>

39
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>that's terrible.</v>

40
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.080
<v Speaker 1>but whenever I compare that 11,000 people total in this ebola crisis and then</v>

42
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>the stat for children,</v>

43
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.700
<v Speaker 1>and this is on water for his website and stuff and,</v>

44
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.870
<v Speaker 1>and on ours and dude,</v>

45
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>it's what I want to fight and let people know because there should be a real</v>

46
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>public outcry and uproar that 5,000 kids,</v>

47
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>50,000 kids under the age of five years old,</v>

48
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 1>die every single day,</v>

49
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>every single day because of dirty water,</v>

50
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>because of waterborne disease,</v>

51
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>because of waterborne illness.</v>

52
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a legit stat from UNICEF or one of those like legit places,</v>

53
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 1>five down,</v>

54
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 1>$5,000 a day.</v>

55
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

56
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>it fluctuates from like 4,700 or something to $50,000 a day.</v>

57
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.751
<v Speaker 1>And like for me,</v>

58
00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:57.991
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

59
00:01:57.991 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

60
00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

61
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>I've held two of those children.</v>

62
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

63
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

64
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

65
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I've dug the grave,</v>

66
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I've had blisters on my hands.</v>

67
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I've had a little dude named Andy Bo's blood on my hands and like,</v>

68
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>like Bro,</v>

69
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.733
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

70
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>it wrecks me and like that's why I'm so passionate about this thing and like</v>

71
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I had come back and like I get it,</v>

72
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>a bowl is terrible and we need to knock it out because it can take out so many</v>

73
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:23.311
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

74
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>

75
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Why are people not like,</v>

76
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>why don't they have their eyes open?</v>

77
00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:33.921
<v Speaker 1>Their ears open their heart open to hearing about 5,000 kids dying every day up</v>

78
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>until the funeral of five other kids.</v>

79
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the grave of nine or 10 others besides that,</v>

80
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.421
<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>

81
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>These are just some of the pygmies I've been to the.</v>

82
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the funerals going on with the,</v>

83
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>of their oppressors,</v>

84
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>like the slave masters and the Mokpala than non pygmies that surround them.</v>

85
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Their kids are dying of dirty water and it's not.</v>

86
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

87
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to go crazy,</v>

88
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:53.941
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

89
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not crazy at all.</v>

90
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:55.240
<v Speaker 1>It's that,</v>

91
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>that statistic is crazy.</v>

92
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Five thousand a day a day and they're under five years old.</v>

93
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

94
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many with the six,</v>

95
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:03.431
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

96
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>eight and nine year olds,</v>

97
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>I've been to the funerals of those kids where we are very strange,</v>

99
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>but what we have,</v>

100
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.590
<v Speaker 1>what we focus our attention on and the Ebola things,</v>

101
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>just something that was over here because we were worried about it coming over</v>

102
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>here and we don't have a problem over here.</v>

103
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>

104
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.540
<v Speaker 1>it's so convenient for people to not look at impoverished third world countries,</v>

105
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>people that are just,</v>

106
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 1>they've always been in this sort of state of poverty.</v>

107
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>So we just sort of accept them as being like that.</v>

108
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>We don't think that they necessarily,</v>

109
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 1>that they have to live the way we live or have access to clean water and</v>

110
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>medical,</v>

111
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>which is telling me,</v>

112
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

113
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>We worry about cecil the lion,</v>

114
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>this the fuck comes out about cecil the lion where everybody's going nuts and</v>

116
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:47.711
<v Speaker 1>freaking out.</v>

117
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:47.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

118
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:48.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>

119
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>poaching is terrible.</v>

120
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>

121
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>So the animals are beautiful and you know,</v>

122
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

123
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>But the way we really reacted to that,</v>

124
00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>to know your statistic,</v>

125
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.230
<v Speaker 1>to know that what you just said had 5,000 little kids die every day from dirty</v>

126
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 1>water and people aren't freaking out about that.</v>

127
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like every 20 seconds.</v>

128
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Who Attacks Pokemon people?</v>

129
00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:12.210
<v Speaker 2>They're like the most adorable,</v>

130
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:13.460
<v Speaker 2>nicest people in the world.</v>

131
00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:14.294
<v Speaker 2>But you look at that.</v>

132
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 2>You said rural.</v>

133
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you not like the word world?</v>

134
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Like world?</v>

135
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Is that how you say world?</v>

136
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.500
<v Speaker 2>How do you say it?</v>

137
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.040
<v Speaker 2>W O r a l d o w e r before the.</v>

138
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

139
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.840
<v Speaker 2>it rolls off the tongue easier than going world world world.</v>

140
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.670
<v Speaker 2>World War old.</v>

141
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.450
<v Speaker 2>How do you say it?</v>

142
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.283
<v Speaker 2>World?</v>

143
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

144
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.440
<v Speaker 2>you don't say it like that world.</v>

145
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.360

<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

167
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.980
<v Speaker 1>the theory being the star wars program has apparently never really effective and</v>

168
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.700
<v Speaker 1>the scientists that were behind the star wars program,</v>

169
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.870
<v Speaker 1>a fuck load of them died by suicide,</v>

170
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:25.830
<v Speaker 1>by murder,</v>

171
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.940
<v Speaker 1>and there's a giant list of them and it's one of the most fascinating</v>

172
00:05:29.941 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies and modern time find it.</v>

173
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

174

175
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.760
<v Speaker 1>these guys that knew the people that knew the scientists,</v>

176
00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:40.530
<v Speaker 1>the engineers dead,</v>

177
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.850
<v Speaker 1>like almost all of them,</v>

178
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.420
<v Speaker 1>they all died like murdered suicide.</v>

179
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.470
<v Speaker 1>And like very,</v>

180
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.480
<v Speaker 1>very suspicious that someone did like a number,</v>

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.991
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

182

<v Speaker 1>they did like a percentage.</v>

184
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Like what are the odds that all these people were murdered inside of billion to</v>

185
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:54.660
<v Speaker 1>one?</v>

<v Speaker 1>They all knew that it was bullshit.</v>

190
00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>The Star Wars program,</v>

191
00:05:58.281 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>they'd spend millions,</v>

192
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:04.481
<v Speaker 1>untold billions of dollars to develop this completely ineffective system to</v>

193
