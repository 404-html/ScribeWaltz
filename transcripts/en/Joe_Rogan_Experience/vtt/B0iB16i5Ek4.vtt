<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.910
<v Speaker 1>it's just a fun day because this is the first day of.</v>

13
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.310
<v Speaker 1>You're listening to this in the future.</v>

14
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>This is the day after the Seth Rogen James Franco movie got pulled from all</v>

15
00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:41.041
<v Speaker 1>theaters because of anonymous threats from some hacker characters,</v>

16
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.860
<v Speaker 1>which is a pretty fucking weird,</v>

17
00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

18
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

19
00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:46.474
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

20
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.040
<v Speaker 1>it's rough sucker right up,</v>

21
00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>right up on my mouth.</v>

22
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>That's what I like to say.</v>

23
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Living inside you.</v>

24
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>

25
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

26
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.041
<v Speaker 1>it is rough.</v>

27
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:54.461
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot of.</v>

28
00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I saw a lot of people reacting yesterday like,</v>

29
00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe America did this.</v>

30
00:00:57.521 --> 00:00:57.821
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

31
00:00:57.821 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>it's Sony is not in America.</v>

32
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Speaker 1>They actually Japanese.</v>

33
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.090
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of Hilarious,</v>

34
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.051
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

35
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:05.621
<v Speaker 1>it is weird,</v>

36
00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

37
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Because I mean it does.</v>

38
00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:11.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean it sets this like this precedent that if you make something that we might</v>

39
00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:11.830
<v Speaker 1>not want,</v>

40
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>we can pressure you away from me.</v>

41
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Actually releasing it.</v>

42
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>A defector says that North Korea has 1800 cyber warriors.</v>

43
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.313
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

44
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.520
<v Speaker 1>That means he has a whole clone of people that will attack anybody that a clone.</v>

45
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean group of clubs.</v>

46
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.450
<v Speaker 1>The whole army army say,</v>

47
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

48
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.660
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man.</v>

49
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

50
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.920
<v Speaker 1>and it's weird,</v>

51
00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:33.101
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Because every time you see like a picture of North Korea and like a person in</v>

53
00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:36.971
<v Speaker 1>front of a computer,</v>

54
00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:38.950
<v Speaker 1>it looks like they're just trying to figure out how to use it.</v>

55
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.731
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

56
00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:40.600
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

57
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

58
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:45.140
<v Speaker 1>obviously South Korea is responsible for Samsung and you know,</v>

59
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.270
<v Speaker 1>so many incredible innovations come out of South Korea.</v>

60
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

61
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.480
<v Speaker 1>they make some of the best electronics in the world.</v>

62
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.730
<v Speaker 1>So I got to think that some of that smarts gets up into North Korea.</v>

63
00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.740
<v Speaker 1>It's going through that minefield.</v>

64
00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:00.574
<v Speaker 1>It's able to get there.</v>

65
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine the state steal people and are something.</v>

66
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.921
<v Speaker 1>They just hire him.</v>

67
00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:06.940
<v Speaker 1>They just throw money at him.</v>

68
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Probably nobody's from South Korea is going to go to North Korea because they'll</v>

69
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:12.094
<v Speaker 1>keep you there.</v>

70
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.480
<v Speaker 1>They'll do whatever the fuck they want.</v>

71
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:13.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

72
00:02:13.691 --> 00:02:16.330
<v Speaker 1>you hear that shit that they do to those people in North Korea.</v>

73
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like the last,</v>

74
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.701
<v Speaker 1>at all,</v>

75
00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 1>those historical dictatorships that you,</v>

76
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:26.830
<v Speaker 1>you heard about like all throughout time where people did horrific,</v>

77
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.260
<v Speaker 1>terrible things to the people that,</v>

78
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:30.041
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

80
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:33.100
<v Speaker 1>there were under the people that were under their mother.</v>

81
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>This is like the last one of those,</v>

82
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.570
<v Speaker 1>the last one that was a real dictatorship,</v>

83
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.400
<v Speaker 1>like one guy who really runs the whole show and everyone's terrified.</v>

84
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:46.390
<v Speaker 1>And I thought there was like the thought that he was actually going to be</v>

86
00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:49.540
<v Speaker 1>knocked out of power and then it just turned out he had a cold and he sprained</v>

87
00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:50.250
<v Speaker 1>his ankle.</v>

88
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.443
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>

90
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.170
<v Speaker 1>who knows what's going on over there.</v>

91
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.430
<v Speaker 1>But as a person who,</v>

92
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 1>you do these youtube videos and you started them essentially,</v>

93
00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>did</v>

94
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 3>you just sit in front of a camera and just create your own?</v>

95
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.680
<v Speaker 3>Just.</v>

96
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

97
00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:04.401
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was,</v>

98
00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:05.000
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

99
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.410
<v Speaker 4>it was eight years ago.</v>

100
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.711
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

101
00:03:06.711 --> 00:03:07.500
<v Speaker 4>I was in,</v>

102
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.360
<v Speaker 4>I was in college,</v>

103
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

104
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.280
<v Speaker 4>I was going through the premed program.</v>

105
00:03:10.281 --> 00:03:12.110
<v Speaker 4>I hated life and I had no money.</v>

106
00:03:12.111 --> 00:03:15.140
<v Speaker 4>So Youtube was just like this free entertainment because I couldn't go out and</v>

107
00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:15.711
<v Speaker 4>do anything.</v>

108
00:03:15.711 --> 00:03:19.580
<v Speaker 4>And so I was watching these videos and even to this day I think like when people</v>

109
00:03:19.581 --> 00:03:20.330
<v Speaker 4>watch me,</v>

110
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.810
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

111
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.310
<v Speaker 4>what is this schmuck talking about?</v>

112
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.320
<v Speaker 4>I could do this and I could probably do it better.</v>

113
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.530
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what I felt eight years ago and I just kinda started ranting about</v>

114
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.730
<v Speaker 4>bill o'reilly and then that turned into more pop culture.</v>

115
00:03:31.731 --> 00:03:33.560
<v Speaker 4>And then it turned into like the eight minute show.</v>

116
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.420
<v Speaker 3>That thing that you did recently,</v>

117
00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:37.160
<v Speaker 3>this is one that really got me,</v>

118
00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:38.420
<v Speaker 3>is that Lena Dunham thing,</v>

119
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.590
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

120
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.071
<v Speaker 3>which one?</v>

121
00:03:40.071 --> 00:03:41.210
<v Speaker 3>I know they've talked about it a few times.</v>

122
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.410
<v Speaker 3>Did you talk about a few times,</v>

123
00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:43.670
<v Speaker 3>the one where you were,</v>

124
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

125
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.801
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

126
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:47.870
<v Speaker 3>you danced around it very well for folks who don't know the story,</v>

127
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Lena Dunham wrote a book and in the book she described this sexual encounter</v>

128
00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:57.950
<v Speaker 3>that she had with a man where,</v>

129
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.863
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

130
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.950
<v Speaker 3>it's tough to say exactly what was going on,</v>

131
00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:05.951
<v Speaker 3>but her description of it was essentially that the guy was being very,</v>

132
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

133
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.360
<v Speaker 3>forward or,</v>

134
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

135
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.261
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

136
00:04:09.261 --> 00:04:10.220
<v Speaker 3>very pushy.</v>

137
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.090
<v Speaker 3>And she started talking dirty to him out of.</v>

138
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how she described that she just was out of fear.</v>

139
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.390
<v Speaker 3>Is that what she said or.</v>

140
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to think of that specific one.</v>

141
00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:22.430
<v Speaker 4>I know that I feel like one of the last time she was in it,</v>

142
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 4>there were people that were accusing her of molesting</v>

143
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 3>her sister.</v>

144
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

145
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 3>That's a different one.</v>

146
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:28.170
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

147
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 3>So definitely think that when you're talking about.</v>

148
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.720
<v Speaker 3>This is the one where she.</v>

149
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 3>She was saying that the guy raped her,</v>

150
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 3>but she was talking dirty to the guy.</v>

151
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I covered that one.</v>

152
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:36.191
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

153
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:36.740
<v Speaker 3>you did.</v>

154
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.960
<v Speaker 3>I did say yeah,</v>

155
00:04:38.961 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 3>you definitely question while you were just saying that it was some mixed</v>

156
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:47.491
<v Speaker 3>signals that she was sending these crazy mixed signals that it confuses people</v>

157
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 3>as to what the definition,</v>

158
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 3>the actual definition of rape.</v>

159
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Like what this,</v>

160
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.783
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

161
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 3>We're in a weird time now.</v>

162
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.230
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

163
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.700
<v Speaker 3>And in this weird time that we're at,</v>

164
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of,</v>

165
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of exposure and a lot of discussion about rape and I think that's</v>

166
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 3>a very good thing because obviously rape is it terrifying,</v>

167
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 3>horrible crime.</v>

168
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 3>I have three daughters,</v>

169
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

170
00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:16.300
<v Speaker 3>it scares the shit out of me.</v>

171
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

172
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

173
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.120
<v Speaker 3>it just as a human being,</v>

174
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 3>it's scares the shit out of me that someone can do that to someone.</v>

175
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 3>But this description which she described in her book,</v>

176
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't sound like you could call that rape to me.</v>

177
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.141
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

178
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like an unfortunate sexual encounter.</v>

179
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.620
<v Speaker 3>Her roommates convinced her after the fact that it was rape,</v>

180
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

181
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 3>the whole story.</v>

182
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.350
<v Speaker 3>She was telling her,</v>

183
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you don't remember what my videos.</v>

184
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:40.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I made this.</v>

185
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 3>You must have.</v>

186
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

187
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.431
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

188
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:43.171
<v Speaker 3>it might've been sourced,</v>

189
00:05:43.171 --> 00:05:43.740
<v Speaker 3>fed maybe.</v>

190
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.921
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

191
00:05:43.921 --> 00:05:44.600
<v Speaker 3>it was you dude.</v>

192
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.110
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

193
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.441
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna.</v>

194
00:05:45.441 --> 00:05:45.711
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna.</v>

195
00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:46.544
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna go after.</v>

196
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.870
<v Speaker 3>Do you find that you motherfucker.</v>

197
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.231
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

198
00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:48.870
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be that,</v>

199
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.730
<v Speaker 3>that got you moment.</v>

200
00:05:49.731 --> 00:05:50.061
<v Speaker 3>I'll be like,</v>

201
00:05:50.061 --> 00:05:51.410
<v Speaker 3>when did I make this video?</v>

202
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.960
<v Speaker 3>But either way,</v>

203
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

204
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:55.410
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

205
00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 3>the idea behind it is that she decided after the fact that somehow or another</v>

206
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 3>this was,</v>

207
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 3>this was rape and then she wrote this book about it.</v>

208
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 3>And now the guy who,</v>

209
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 3>you didn't talk about this,</v>

210
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:15.731
<v Speaker 3>but the guy who was the accused in this has now lawyered up and even though he's</v>

211
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 3>under a different name,</v>

212
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 3>people have sort of identified who he actually is and it's become this crazy</v>

213
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:22.671
<v Speaker 3>ugly thing.</v>

214
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:27.671
<v Speaker 3>And then it came out that she molested her 12 year old sister for like a lot of</v>

215
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:30.374
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

216
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.333
<v Speaker 3>Many years.</v>

217
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

218
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.681
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

219
00:06:31.681 --> 00:06:31.801
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

220
00:06:31.801 --> 00:06:35.190
<v Speaker 4>there was the story that she wrote in the book and it was about her sister when</v>

221
00:06:35.191 --> 00:06:36.930
<v Speaker 4>she was like one or two.</v>

222
00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:37.860
<v Speaker 4>I think it was something like that.</v>

223
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.130
<v Speaker 4>And there was like the gravel story and I mean that was,</v>

224
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.993
<v Speaker 4>that was weird.</v>

225
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.770
<v Speaker 4>The way that I like to cover it is if it's not black and white,</v>

226
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.450
<v Speaker 4>which very few things are.</v>

227
00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:53.220
<v Speaker 4>I try to talk about what both sides say and then like where my mental</v>

228
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.280
<v Speaker 4>place is at that moment.</v>

229
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.970
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

230
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.460
<v Speaker 4>but I mean there's a lot of conversation about,</v>

231
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.510
<v Speaker 4>about rape right now.</v>

232
00:07:00.511 --> 00:07:01.650
<v Speaker 4>And I think I agree with you,</v>

233
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:02.484
<v Speaker 4>it is a,</v>

234
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.480
<v Speaker 4>it is very good.</v>

235
00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:05.850
<v Speaker 4>Especially with all the bill bill cosby stuff.</v>

236
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:06.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

237
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 3>This was what it was.</v>

238
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 3>It was real rape versus rape culture.</v>

239
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.283
<v Speaker 4>How long ago was that?</v>

240
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.333
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

241
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.030
<v Speaker 3>What did you just Google Philly.</v>

242
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.240
<v Speaker 3>The rape because this is weird now.</v>

243
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:19.480
<v Speaker 3>I might,</v>

244
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.261
<v Speaker 3>I might be wrong.</v>

245
00:07:20.261 --> 00:07:20.560
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

246
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.140
<v Speaker 3>I might be wrong and it actually might have been somebody else into that video.</v>

247
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.393
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

248
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.480
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

249
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.901
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

250
00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:26.734
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done.</v>

251
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.520
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

252
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.360
<v Speaker 3>You've done a few though,</v>

253
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

254
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.540
<v Speaker 3>You've done a few on her in this whole story.</v>

255
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.480
<v Speaker 4>I've talked about her in the book.</v>

256
00:07:33.481 --> 00:07:37.440
<v Speaker 4>I've talked about a rape stories recently just because it's.</v>

257
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.430
<v Speaker 4>There's just.</v>

258
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.930
<v Speaker 4>There is a real conversation to be had and so many times it just gets lost on</v>

259
00:07:42.931 --> 00:07:47.340
<v Speaker 4>the Internet whether it's some stupid Hashtag that goes out there and had a good</v>

260
00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:50.640
<v Speaker 4>intention and gets hijacked and then it becomes just men versus women rather</v>

261
00:07:50.641 --> 00:07:52.050
<v Speaker 4>than all of us against.</v>

262
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.350
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

263
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.541
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

264
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:54.780
<v Speaker 3>it was steven crowder.</v>

265
00:07:54.781 --> 00:07:55.591
<v Speaker 3>That's who it was.</v>

266
00:07:55.591 --> 00:07:56.160
<v Speaker 3>I got you.</v>

267
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.060
<v Speaker 3>I got you confused,</v>

268
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:57.931
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

269
00:07:57.931 --> 00:07:59.580
<v Speaker 3>all of us versus rapists.</v>

270
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

271
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.520
<v Speaker 3>This what is going on,</v>

272
00:08:02.521 --> 00:08:06.230
<v Speaker 3>like why is like rape such a hot topic right now?</v>

273
00:08:06.231 --> 00:08:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Like do we go in cycles where things become like important things to talk about</v>

274
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.150
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason?</v>

275
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.870
<v Speaker 3>Like right now,</v>

276
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:13.920
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's race.</v>

277
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Race is a huge one now because of Ferguson,</v>

278
00:08:16.321 --> 00:08:20.430
<v Speaker 3>because of the guy that got killed in New York or Eric Gardener.</v>

279
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.600
<v Speaker 3>We go in these weird cycles like pop culture cycle.</v>

280
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.221
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

281
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think it's something hits and then it is always a mishmash of think of</v>

282
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.290
<v Speaker 4>is it a real issue and people know that they're going to get clicks.</v>

283
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.000
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

284
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.180
<v Speaker 4>it's just riding that wave.</v>

285
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 4>I think a big part of it is riding that wave but also like it's a problem.</v>

286
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.730
<v Speaker 4>I think when I talk to people,</v>

287
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it is,</v>

288
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:43.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

289
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.690
<v Speaker 4>I understand that I don't have that,</v>

290
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.630
<v Speaker 4>that mindset because of whether people call it white privilege or just like my</v>

291
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 4>specific specific way of being raised.</v>

292
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't have that outlook on life.</v>

293
00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 4>So I find it very interesting.</v>

294
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

295
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:57.290
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

296
00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>I think especially now with,</v>

297
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

298
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.320
<v Speaker 1>with race,</v>

299
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 1>with race and with a police brutality like this is probably,</v>

300
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 1>this subject has been brought up more and not just obviously on youtube videos</v>

301
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:15.150
<v Speaker 1>but just all throughout social media over the last couple months that I can ever</v>

302
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:15.740
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>

303
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 1>like in my lifetime.</v>

304
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think of other times.</v>

305
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:20.574
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

306
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.540
<v Speaker 1>race mean don't you think with all this,</v>

307
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:24.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

308
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Eric Garner stuff and all the stuff that's going on right now with,</v>

309
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:28.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

310
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

311
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.800
<v Speaker 1>with Ferguson and the police protest.</v>

312
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 1>This is a strange time.</v>

313
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:33.881
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

314
00:09:33.881 --> 00:09:34.830
<v Speaker 4>it's very strange time.</v>

315
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 4>I um,</v>

316
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:35.630
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

317
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.940
<v Speaker 4>the situation in New New York I think perplex me the most just because uh,</v>

318
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:44.940
<v Speaker 4>I've been always just for the longest time talking about body cams on cops and</v>

319
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 4>it just like,</v>

320
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.440
<v Speaker 4>it has to be a thing.</v>

321
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.030
<v Speaker 4>But like everything else,</v>

322
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 4>there's no one fix.</v>

323
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 4>It's not like we throw cameras on and it's like,</v>

324
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:51.743
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

325
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.583
<v Speaker 4>racism stopped.</v>

326
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.590
<v Speaker 4>But I do believe that it is a good first step and I think then you do have to</v>

327
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.410
<v Speaker 4>punish officers that do not turn those on.</v>

328
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 4>And I think that places that make it where you can punish someone for filming a</v>

329
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:08.050
<v Speaker 4>police officer if you into agonize the cop,</v>

330
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:08.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

331
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:09.870
<v Speaker 4>I think that's something.</v>

332
00:10:09.871 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 4>But just filming,</v>

333
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:12.690
<v Speaker 4>like showing what happened.</v>

334
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.750
<v Speaker 4>Like that's crazy.</v>

335
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.291
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

336
00:10:14.291 --> 00:10:16.880
<v Speaker 1>And they just passed that recently in one of the states,</v>

337
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.793
<v Speaker 1>Illinois,</v>

338
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.131
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>

339
00:10:18.131 --> 00:10:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

340
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Chicago is just insane.</v>

341
00:10:20.141 --> 00:10:20.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

342
00:10:20.351 --> 00:10:25.351
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what the fuck they're trying to accomplish by not having complete</v>

343
00:10:25.631 --> 00:10:26.770
<v Speaker 1>transparency like that.</v>

344
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.940
<v Speaker 1>That's bizarre.</v>

345
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:28.291
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

346
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:28.611
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

347
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:28.740
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

348
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.880
<v Speaker 4>you wonder like why.</v>

349
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:30.421
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

350
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:33.210
<v Speaker 4>and there have been police officers that come out saying the only people that</v>

351
00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:33.820
<v Speaker 4>would be against</v>

352
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.870
<v Speaker 1>this are dirty cops.</v>

353
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

354
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Or people that just don't want any more scrutiny.</v>

355
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they think that maybe they think there's like,</v>

356
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.990
<v Speaker 1>especially with Chicago,</v>

357
00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Chicago is so bad and the gang violence in Chicago is so completely out of</v>

358
00:10:45.221 --> 00:10:45.731
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

359
00:10:45.731 --> 00:10:46.660
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

360
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.730
<v Speaker 1>you read about the murder rates in Chicago,</v>

361
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:50.050
<v Speaker 1>they're off the charts.</v>

362
00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's think the only way to clean that up is to just fight fire with</v>

363
00:10:53.771 --> 00:10:58.480
<v Speaker 1>fire and just use dirty cop k tactics or something like some big summer</v>

364
00:10:58.481 --> 00:10:59.740
<v Speaker 1>blockbuster movie where you're like,</v>

365
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:00.281
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

366
00:11:00.281 --> 00:11:00.611
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

367
00:11:00.611 --> 00:11:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

368
00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

369
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.010
<v Speaker 1>like some Denzel Washington character from that.</v>

370
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.320
<v Speaker 1>What was the movie training day where it becomes,</v>

371
00:11:08.321 --> 00:11:09.154
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

372
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

373
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

374
00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:11.763
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

375
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:12.001
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

376
00:11:12.001 --> 00:11:12.330
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

377
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.760
<v Speaker 1>you started just ranting about things on these youtube videos.</v>

378
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Where along the line did everybody on Youtube agree to do these smash cuts?</v>

379
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:23.381
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

380
00:11:23.381 --> 00:11:27.670
<v Speaker 1>will you edit out all of the dead air in between everything you say,</v>

381
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:29.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

382
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.540
<v Speaker 1>that weird thing that you guys do?</v>

383
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

384
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

385
00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:32.560
<v Speaker 1>The jump cut.</v>

386
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

387
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.753
<v Speaker 1>the jump cut.</v>

388
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean the jump cut was a thing before,</v>

389
00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:37.480
<v Speaker 4>before I did anything.</v>

390
00:11:37.481 --> 00:11:40.900
<v Speaker 4>I think the guy that popularized it was zay frank who works.</v>

391
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.090
<v Speaker 4>He's like one of the big guys over at buzzfeed now,</v>

392
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.120
<v Speaker 4>but I mean just any,</v>

393
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.991
<v Speaker 4>anytime online,</v>

394
00:11:46.991 --> 00:11:48.190
<v Speaker 4>it's not for youtube.</v>

395
00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:53.191
<v Speaker 4>It's very not a podcast in the sense of where we're sitting down and you can</v>

396
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:55.260
<v Speaker 4>take a moment to to,</v>

397
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 4>to drink those seconds matter.</v>

398
00:11:57.191 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 4>If I don't make you interested in 15 seconds,</v>

399
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.160
<v Speaker 4>you're out.</v>

400
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that crazy?</v>

401
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:01.991
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's very.</v>

402
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:04.220
<v Speaker 4>It's very add overtime.</v>

403
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.060
<v Speaker 4>A youtube video is the longer content,</v>

404
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.800
<v Speaker 4>longer content can live,</v>

405
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.330
<v Speaker 4>but it is.</v>

406
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.270
<v Speaker 4>It is kind of what you have to understand when you're making that content,</v>

407
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it like in that sense,</v>

408
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:17.680
<v Speaker 1>aren't you like kowtowing to morons?</v>

409
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.270
<v Speaker 1>You think someone who can't,</v>

410
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 1>can't like pause</v>

411
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:21.451
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

412
00:12:21.451 --> 00:12:23.250
<v Speaker 4>It's become just kind of the,</v>

413
00:12:23.251 --> 00:12:23.881
<v Speaker 4>the entertainment.</v>

414
00:12:23.881 --> 00:12:28.350
<v Speaker 4>I think I enjoy a video that has jump cuts and then if I'm in my car,</v>

415
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm riding my bike,</v>

416
00:12:29.341 --> 00:12:30.061
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing whatever.</v>

417
00:12:30.061 --> 00:12:32.970
<v Speaker 4>That's when I listened to a podcast or if I might like relaxing.</v>

418
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.110
<v Speaker 4>If I'm at work and I have 12 minutes left on my break,</v>

419
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.530
<v Speaker 4>I want to try and get in as much as possible.</v>

420
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:39.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

421
00:12:39.841 --> 00:12:41.360
<v Speaker 1>your videos are very entertaining.</v>

422
00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>

423
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.321
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

424
00:12:42.321 --> 00:12:43.700
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing bad about them,</v>

425
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.320
<v Speaker 1>but the jump cut thing,</v>

426
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.370
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

427
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.350
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like it just grabs you,</v>

428
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:48.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

429
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

430
00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:49.670
<v Speaker 1>you can't let go.</v>

431
00:12:49.671 --> 00:12:49.851
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

432
00:12:49.851 --> 00:12:51.080
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker's not gonna stop.</v>

433
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.151
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to stop talking.</v>

434
00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:56.150
<v Speaker 1>I says one complete sentence that you know,</v>

435
00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.710
<v Speaker 1>you're taking out every error,</v>

436
00:12:58.711 --> 00:12:59.120
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

437
00:12:59.120 --> 00:12:59.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

438
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.343
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

439
00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.270
<v Speaker 1>every deep breath and everything,</v>

440
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:02.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

441
00:13:02.631 --> 00:13:04.600
<v Speaker 1>it's just tonight.</v>

442
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to America Max headroom called it,</v>

443
00:13:07.911 --> 00:13:08.480
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

444
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.313
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

445
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Back in the day,</v>

446
00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.520
<v Speaker 1>like all sort of,</v>

447
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:14.003
<v Speaker 1>kind of</v>

448
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.221
<v Speaker 4>first started,</v>

449
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:15.461
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

450
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:16.690
<v Speaker 4>it was much worse.</v>

451
00:13:16.691 --> 00:13:16.891
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

452
00:13:16.891 --> 00:13:17.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

453
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:17.800
<v Speaker 4>because I would,</v>

454
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.510
<v Speaker 4>I would edit in imovie and so I could just shoot one part of a sentence at a</v>

455
00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:23.920
<v Speaker 4>time and then change the frame.</v>

456
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.480
<v Speaker 4>And so if you go to my older videos,</v>

457
00:13:25.481 --> 00:13:26.530
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>

458
00:13:26.531 --> 00:13:27.131
<v Speaker 4>very jarring.</v>

459
00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:30.010
<v Speaker 4>While in the new stuff sometimes maybe you get 25 seconds,</v>

460
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.930
<v Speaker 4>how many youtube followers do you have now?</v>

461
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.300
<v Speaker 4>You to somewhere in 3 million.</v>

462
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.330
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>

463
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

464
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.090
<v Speaker 4>how have you done this?</v>

465
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.081
<v Speaker 4>It's over eight years.</v>

466
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:39.040
<v Speaker 4>It's not like a lot of these,</v>

467
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.010
<v Speaker 4>the new young British kids that uh,</v>

468
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:42.690
<v Speaker 4>they just,</v>

469
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.110
<v Speaker 4>they make a video where they,</v>

470
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:44.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

471
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.250
<v Speaker 4>it's like five things I love and it's like 8 million views.</v>

472
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:49.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

473
00:13:49.051 --> 00:13:49.591
<v Speaker 1>You've created.</v>

474
00:13:49.591 --> 00:13:53.430
<v Speaker 1>What is the other thing that I like about you is you like me also like</v>

475
00:13:53.431 --> 00:13:54.300
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees.</v>

476
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.163
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

477
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.620
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that your,</v>

478
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.650
<v Speaker 1>your logo has a chimpanzee on it.</v>

479
00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.513
<v Speaker 1>What's that all about?</v>

480
00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:00.403
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

481
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it was.</v>

482
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.433
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

483
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.040
<v Speaker 4>it's not even like a cool creative reason.</v>

484
00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:07.200
<v Speaker 4>It's for just for greed,</v>

485
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.260
<v Speaker 4>estes monkey poster and my background,</v>

486
00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.510
<v Speaker 4>the first two years of my,</v>

487
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:13.260
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

488
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.480
<v Speaker 4>my youtube career if you want to call that.</v>

489
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:16.920
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

490
00:14:16.921 --> 00:14:17.850
<v Speaker 4>I can't sell these,</v>

491
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.110
<v Speaker 4>so let's make our own.</v>

492
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.200
<v Speaker 4>And that's Hilarious,</v>

493
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.420
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

494
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:20.760
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

495
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:20.951
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

496
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:21.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

497
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:21.610
<v Speaker 4>we did it.</v>

498
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:22.421
<v Speaker 1>3 million,</v>

499
00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:25.510
<v Speaker 1>397,000 subscribers.</v>

500
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.373
<v Speaker 1>Damn some.</v>

501
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Should you stand in front of a camera mostly and just talking.</v>

502
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.010
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

503
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:30.843
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

504
00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.240
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

505
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.450
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

506
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:31.800
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

507
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.640
<v Speaker 4>I've created a,</v>

508
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.550
<v Speaker 4>some new channels with different people just so that something can grow past me,</v>

509
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.780
<v Speaker 4>but for the most part,</v>

510
00:14:37.781 --> 00:14:39.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's at the end of the day.</v>

511
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:39.964
<v Speaker 4>That's the main thing.</v>

512
00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.730
<v Speaker 4>So you started a whole business because of this.</v>

513
00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:42.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

514
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.140
<v Speaker 4>So I uh,</v>

515
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.980
<v Speaker 4>after doing this for awhile,</v>

516
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.360
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

517
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.840
<v Speaker 4>youtube came to us and it was part of this like big youtube channel initiative,</v>

518
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 4>I think they spent like $1,000,000 across</v>

519
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 1>the board and like vice jumped in red bull,</v>

520
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:57.290
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of other things that aren't on there anymore.</v>

521
00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

522
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Speaker 1>and so I create another channel called source fat.</v>

523
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:00.801
<v Speaker 1>And then from there,</v>

524
00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:01.634
<v Speaker 1>source fed nerd.</v>

525
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

526
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.400
<v Speaker 1>and then after about a year and a half of that,</v>

527
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 1>it was acquired by discovery.</v>

528
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.990
<v Speaker 1>And so now we're just making stuff with and for discovery.</v>

529
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.820
<v Speaker 1>There's so many of these guys out there doing this now.</v>

530
00:15:11.821 --> 00:15:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

531
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 1>you were one of the first ones,</v>

532
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:18.440
<v Speaker 1>but like you can't keep up with how many people are just standing in front of a</v>

533
00:15:18.441 --> 00:15:20.120
<v Speaker 1>camera commenting on,</v>

534
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:20.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

535
00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:23.180
<v Speaker 1>whatever pop culture or the news,</v>

536
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

537
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:25.310
<v Speaker 1>things that are going on.</v>

538
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

539
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.160
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting that there is,</v>

540
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.860
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people that are really good at this.</v>

541
00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:31.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

542
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.290
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

543
00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.360
<v Speaker 1>this is something where if we lived a decade ago,</v>

544
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.540
<v Speaker 1>there's no outlet for most of these people.</v>

545
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 1>And so they would all have normal lives.</v>

546
00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:41.144
<v Speaker 1>They would be in,</v>

547
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:41.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

548
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.260
<v Speaker 1>you would be in medical school or you'd be a doctor by now or someone would be,</v>

549
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:45.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

550
00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:46.334
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

551
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.800
<v Speaker 1>whatever other job they chose instead.</v>

552
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

553
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:49.700

557
00:15:56.751 --> 00:15:57.531

558
00:15:57.531 --> 00:15:57.681

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:37.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

585
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.350
<v Speaker 1>That's when it starts sort of.</v>

586
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.180
<v Speaker 1>I've been waiting.</v>

587
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I've been waiting for it to feel that moment.</v>

588
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean if I met me when I was 30 I'd be like,</v>

589
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:45.561
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

590
00:16:45.561 --> 00:16:46.394
<v Speaker 1>you ain't a man.</v>

591
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.451
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah.</v>

592
00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:49.010
<v Speaker 1>When I think about some of the stuff I said,</v>

593
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know if it.</v>

594
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Does that stop like when when you're 30 or you like I never said anything else I</v>

595
00:16:53.901 --> 00:16:54.734
<v Speaker 1>ever regretted.</v>

596
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

597
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:56.871
<v Speaker 1>it never stops.</v>

598
00:16:56.871 --> 00:16:57.591
<v Speaker 1>I regret some shit.</v>

599
00:16:57.591 --> 00:16:58.424
<v Speaker 1>I said an hour ago.</v>

600
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.051
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

601
00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:01.350
<v Speaker 1>getting around it is.</v>

602
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean as a human being,</v>

603
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:03.640
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

604
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:03.830
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

605
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:04.663
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

606
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I think the development of life is sorta like peaks and valleys sort of thing,</v>

607
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.830
<v Speaker 1>like you hit these peaks and then you fuck up and you,</v>

608
00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:11.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

609
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.190
<v Speaker 1>just like we were talking about before about a tom score and you doing some sort</v>

610
00:17:16.191 --> 00:17:19.880
<v Speaker 1>of a podcast where you lose weight yet the reality is you'll lose all that</v>

611
00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:22.550
<v Speaker 1>weight and then you'll fucking get fat again for a little bit and then he tried</v>

612
00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:27.551
<v Speaker 1>to lose all that weight and I think it's very difficult to completely change who</v>

613
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:32.360
<v Speaker 1>you are or to completely stop saying words that you've tried to cut out of your</v>

614
00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:35.990
<v Speaker 1>vernacular or completely stopped doing certain things.</v>

615
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Like I was listening to bill burr the other day was talking about he's just</v>

616
00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.130
<v Speaker 1>going to stop watching porn.</v>

617
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:41.570
<v Speaker 1>He stopped.</v>

618
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.430
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't watched porn like four days.</v>

619
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.790
<v Speaker 1>He's like talk like as if that's some sort of accomplishment.</v>

620
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:49.100
<v Speaker 1>You've,</v>

621
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 1>you gone for days.</v>

622
00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations.</v>

623
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:52.310
<v Speaker 1>You're not?</v>

624
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.830
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

625
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:52.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

626
00:17:52.961 --> 00:17:53.810
<v Speaker 1>can you think of what do you.</v>

627
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.880
<v Speaker 1>What's your number that have gone without watching porn?</v>

628
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

629
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:03.110
<v Speaker 1>when I've gone camping or have this like a week flew,</v>

630
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.490
<v Speaker 1>but then the moment I get to the hotel,</v>

631
00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:08.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

632
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.091
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

633
00:18:09.091 --> 00:18:09.541
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

634
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:11.550
<v Speaker 1>It's probably never been more than a couple of weeks.</v>

635
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely gotten a couple of weeks just because I've been busy.</v>

636
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.133
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

637
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 1>it's too accessible.</v>

638
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to think like what's,</v>

639
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.560
<v Speaker 1>what's the longest,</v>

640
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:20.453
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

641
00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Did you watch it today?</v>

642
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:23.990
<v Speaker 4>Today?</v>

643
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.670
<v Speaker 4>I know I covered a story on pornhub for because they released him for</v>

644
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.370
<v Speaker 4>journalism.</v>

645
00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:33.483
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

646
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.670
<v Speaker 4>It's very serious.</v>

647
00:18:34.671 --> 00:18:35.151
<v Speaker 4>I know it was,</v>

648
00:18:35.151 --> 00:18:35.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

649
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:36.283
<v Speaker 4>it was just a story.</v>

650
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.210
<v Speaker 4>My whole thing is like bringing,</v>

651
00:18:38.211 --> 00:18:43.070
<v Speaker 4>it kind of gets the HBO model where like every first season it's just like set</v>

652
00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:43.611
<v Speaker 4>dirty,</v>

653
00:18:43.611 --> 00:18:47.570
<v Speaker 4>sloppy sex in random scenes that make no sense and then they're like,</v>

654
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.550
<v Speaker 4>and we're going to keep you because it's really good.</v>

655
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.840
<v Speaker 4>Really good TV show.</v>

656
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.793
<v Speaker 4>Like big love,</v>

657
00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.090
<v Speaker 4>big love was nothing but like for like the first season and then it was like,</v>

658
00:18:56.091 --> 00:18:57.560
<v Speaker 4>and then here's the storyline.</v>

659
00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:58.750
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

660
00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:59.071
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

661
00:18:59.071 --> 00:18:59.904
<v Speaker 4>it was a what,</v>

662
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.030
<v Speaker 4>what countries last put longest?</v>

663
00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:04.970
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

664
00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.350
<v Speaker 4>Is it China?</v>

665
00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:07.070
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

666
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why,</v>

667
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:08.130
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

668
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.760
<v Speaker 4>how long they last a.</v>

669
00:19:09.761 --> 00:19:10.400
<v Speaker 4>it's about,</v>

670
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.820
<v Speaker 4>on average it's 15 minutes and then in the United States,</v>

671
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.451
<v Speaker 4>Tempe,</v>

672
00:19:14.451 --> 00:19:17.270
<v Speaker 4>Arizona is one of the shortest with five minutes.</v>

673
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.900
<v Speaker 4>And for some reason just coke hands</v>

674
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.790
<v Speaker 4>find that out a well.</v>

675
00:19:22.791 --> 00:19:27.791
<v Speaker 4>They just looked at the amount of time someone stayed on a video page and then</v>

676
00:19:27.861 --> 00:19:28.694
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>

677
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.920
<v Speaker 4>And then for some reason mountain view,</v>

678
00:19:30.921 --> 00:19:32.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's happening in mountain view,</v>

679
00:19:32.211 --> 00:19:33.680
<v Speaker 4>but they last 21 minutes.</v>

680
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:34.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what they're doing.</v>

681
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.000
<v Speaker 4>Mountain view the last 21 minutes.</v>

682
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.103
<v Speaker 4>That's the average.</v>

683
00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.041
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what they're doing.</v>

684
00:19:40.041 --> 00:19:43.000
<v Speaker 4>They're probably distracted with mountain lions outside of their house or some</v>

685
00:19:43.001 --> 00:19:43.834
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

686
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Put their parents up every couple of minutes.</v>

687
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Scratching at the door.</v>

688
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.433
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

689
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

690
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:51.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

691
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:51.890
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

692
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:56.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird time when it comes to porn as well because there's just never been</v>

693
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.340
<v Speaker 1>in any time in history where you could watch people fuck so easily.</v>

694
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

695
00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:03.311
<v Speaker 4>yeah man.</v>

696
00:20:03.311 --> 00:20:03.561
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

697
00:20:03.561 --> 00:20:04.151
<v Speaker 4>I remember,</v>

698
00:20:04.151 --> 00:20:04.660
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

699
00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.100
<v Speaker 4>it was like a big thing for me.</v>

700
00:20:06.101 --> 00:20:10.300
<v Speaker 4>My parents were gone for two days and I was just trustworthy enough where they</v>

701
00:20:10.301 --> 00:20:13.720
<v Speaker 4>will leave me at home and I remember when you would have to buy a three hour</v>

702
00:20:13.721 --> 00:20:18.721
<v Speaker 4>block of playboy on it was like direct TV and I put a vhs and I was like,</v>

703
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:20.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm saving this forever.</v>

704
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.900
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

705
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.260
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

706
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.790
<v Speaker 4>but then I was like afterwards,</v>

707
00:20:24.791 --> 00:20:25.930
<v Speaker 4>where you like it afterwards,</v>

708
00:20:25.931 --> 00:20:27.460
<v Speaker 4>where you realized you made a terrible decision.</v>

709
00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:27.941
<v Speaker 4>You're just like,</v>

710
00:20:27.941 --> 00:20:28.570
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

711
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:29.560
<v Speaker 4>the bill is going to come.</v>

712
00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.630
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm just waiting every day.</v>

713
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:32.703
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

714
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.410
<v Speaker 4>and the bill comes in,</v>

715
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.020
<v Speaker 4>I open it up.</v>

716
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

717
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.730
<v Speaker 4>the steam thing doesn't work.</v>

718
00:20:39.731 --> 00:20:40.564
<v Speaker 4>I have to rip it open.</v>

719
00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:40.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

720
00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.200
<v Speaker 4>but luckily we have our own things and uh,</v>

721
00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.380
<v Speaker 4>and I take it out,</v>

722
00:20:44.381 --> 00:20:48.460
<v Speaker 4>I scan it for some reason we have an old school because I don't know,</v>

723
00:20:48.461 --> 00:20:52.030
<v Speaker 4>photoshop or whatever the equivalent is when I'm 16 years old.</v>

724
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:52.751
<v Speaker 4>And I like,</v>

725
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:57.640
<v Speaker 4>I faked an entire bill so that they would think I got titanic that's held there.</v>

726
00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:58.850
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

727
00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:59.890
<v Speaker 4>I was terrified.</v>

728
00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:01.240
<v Speaker 4>But I was very proud of myself.</v>

729
00:21:01.241 --> 00:21:02.140
<v Speaker 4>I was very proud of myself.</v>

730
00:21:02.141 --> 00:21:04.330
<v Speaker 4>That's a brilliant way of handling it,</v>

731
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:04.781
<v Speaker 4>but it was.</v>

732
00:21:04.781 --> 00:21:06.910
<v Speaker 4>It was a very in the moment terrified.</v>

733
00:21:06.911 --> 00:21:07.361
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

734
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:08.110
<v Speaker 4>what did I just do?</v>

735
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.490
<v Speaker 1>But they still paid the bill.</v>

736
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:09.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

737
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:10.710
<v Speaker 1>they paid so it was fine.</v>

738
00:21:10.711 --> 00:21:11.970
<v Speaker 1>So they really never found out.</v>

739
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:12.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

740
00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.670
<v Speaker 4>never found genius.</v>

741
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.710
<v Speaker 4>It's like the one time I got away with something,</v>

742
00:21:15.711 --> 00:21:16.544
<v Speaker 4>she'll tell him now,</v>

743
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.630
<v Speaker 4>just bring it up at Thanksgiving next year.</v>

744
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:21.783
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>

745
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.230
<v Speaker 1>There was a time and those playboy blocks are fucking brutal anyway because you</v>

746
00:21:26.231 --> 00:21:27.120
<v Speaker 1>never saw real.</v>

747
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean you kind of saw sex,</v>

748
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 1>like they would show penetration for like a second or two,</v>

749
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:33.250
<v Speaker 1>but there was no cum shots.</v>

750
00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:34.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why cum shots are important.</v>

751
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Usually no penetration in the hbo play or the playboy for the playboy stuff.</v>

752
00:21:39.421 --> 00:21:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Some of them have a little.</v>

753
00:21:40.931 --> 00:21:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I think right?</v>

754
00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.440
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes just like there was shows that you're like,</v>

755
00:21:45.441 --> 00:21:46.221
<v Speaker 4>why is this a thing?</v>

756
00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:47.120
<v Speaker 4>There was sex court.</v>

757
00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if anyone's ever remembered that.</v>

758
00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.090
<v Speaker 4>It would just be like,</v>

759
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.900
<v Speaker 4>it would be a guy that was not paying enough attention to his wife and the judge</v>

760
00:21:53.901 --> 00:21:54.600
<v Speaker 4>would like</v>

761
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.750
<v Speaker 1>suck his wife's tits</v>

762
00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.110
<v Speaker 1>just like Josh down to it.</v>

763
00:21:59.120 --> 00:21:59.953
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

764
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Just pass down some weird judgment.</v>

765
00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

766
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:03.773
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

767
00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:05.723
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

768
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:06.270
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

769
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:11.270
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda odd that technology is fueled in a lot of ways by porn,</v>

770
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:12.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

771
00:22:12.481 --> 00:22:13.770
<v Speaker 1>like html five.</v>

772
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>

773
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.870
<v Speaker 1>when that came along like that,</v>

774
00:22:15.871 --> 00:22:18.210
<v Speaker 1>one of the earliest adopters was porn,</v>

775
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

776
00:22:18.931 --> 00:22:20.690
<v Speaker 1>and because the iphone,</v>

777
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.810
<v Speaker 1>the ipads were using html five and they weren't using flash anymore.</v>

778
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:25.681
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>

779
00:22:25.681 --> 00:22:25.950
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

780
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:26.783
<v Speaker 1>fuck flash,</v>

781
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:27.391
<v Speaker 1>fuck flash,</v>

782
00:22:27.391 --> 00:22:28.224
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go with this.</v>

783
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's essentially what happened,</v>

784
00:22:29.761 --> 00:22:30.594
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

785
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:31.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

786
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.290
<v Speaker 4>But how is flashy even still alive to this day?</v>

787
00:22:33.291 --> 00:22:34.890
<v Speaker 4>I have problems with flash every day.</v>

788
00:22:34.891 --> 00:22:37.010
<v Speaker 4>Do you guys have the problems every day?</v>

789
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.240
<v Speaker 4>I always forget it's a thing until I have eight tabs open and then all of them</v>

790
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:40.900
<v Speaker 1>crash.</v>

791
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

792
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.360
<v Speaker 1>definitely crashes.</v>

793
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.433
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

794
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:48.830
<v Speaker 1>it's just a weird sort of a thing and it's also got a weird reputation because</v>

795
00:22:50.011 --> 00:22:55.011
<v Speaker 1>steve jobs was so anti flash and so like outward about some open about being</v>

796
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.040
<v Speaker 1>anti flash,</v>

797
00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.200
<v Speaker 1>but yet it's still around</v>

798
00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.130
<v Speaker 4>and it's still got holes in it.</v>

799
00:23:00.131 --> 00:23:00.731
<v Speaker 4>It's still,</v>

800
00:23:00.731 --> 00:23:01.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

801
00:23:01.191 --> 00:23:03.460
<v Speaker 4>a big problem security wise and,</v>

802
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:08.470
<v Speaker 4>and now with a safari almost blocking flash to the point where videos won't work</v>

803
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.620
<v Speaker 4>and there's like this little banner that's supposed to pop up that says it's</v>

804
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.160
<v Speaker 4>like power setting mode or something that never does,</v>

805
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.020
<v Speaker 4>so then you have to like update the flash and it's just,</v>

806
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.371
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

807
00:23:18.371 --> 00:23:19.450
<v Speaker 4>it's a pain in the ass.</v>

808
00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.630
<v Speaker 4>There's so many things that are just happening.</v>

809
00:23:22.631 --> 00:23:23.464
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't,</v>

810
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.300
<v Speaker 4>I still don't know what adobe reader is.</v>

811
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.310
<v Speaker 4>I just know that I updated it all of time.</v>

812
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.250
<v Speaker 1>What does it do for pdfs or you're right,</v>

813
00:23:32.251 --> 00:23:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is.</v>

814
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

815
00:23:33.811 --> 00:23:35.880
<v Speaker 1>what does adobe reader do?</v>

816
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Some of them will tweet us.</v>

817
00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they're like,</v>

818
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

819
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever looked into it.</v>

820
00:23:42.331 --> 00:23:43.440
<v Speaker 1>I just always say yes.</v>

821
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.393
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

822
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Sign did not update the shit out of that stupid thing.</v>

823
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.210
<v Speaker 1>When you make your videos to you,</v>

824
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:55.480
<v Speaker 1>do you do it based on pop culture based on what's in the news based on Shit you</v>

825
00:23:55.671 --> 00:23:56.481
<v Speaker 1>want to talk about,</v>

826
00:23:56.481 --> 00:23:57.290
<v Speaker 1>like how do you,</v>

827
00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:58.840
<v Speaker 1>how do you set out to create a video?</v>

828
00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.340
<v Speaker 4>I think it's 70 percent,</v>

829
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:00.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

830
00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.020
<v Speaker 4>stuff that I want to talk about.</v>

831
00:24:02.021 --> 00:24:03.250
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

832
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.820
<v Speaker 4>I always want to talk about one big worldwide story today.</v>

833
00:24:06.821 --> 00:24:07.750
<v Speaker 4>I think it is actually the,</v>

834
00:24:07.751 --> 00:24:07.821
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

835
00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:10.510
<v Speaker 4>the Sony story because I mean,</v>

836
00:24:10.511 --> 00:24:11.590
<v Speaker 4>this kind of,</v>

837
00:24:11.591 --> 00:24:12.091
<v Speaker 4>if you think about it,</v>

838
00:24:12.091 --> 00:24:16.300
<v Speaker 4>the stoner movie has somehow now turned into just an international conflict.</v>

839
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:17.501
<v Speaker 4>And then.</v>

840
00:24:17.501 --> 00:24:18.670
<v Speaker 4>So that's the main story.</v>

841
00:24:18.671 --> 00:24:21.670
<v Speaker 4>And then I opened with porn hub's stats because that's what you do.</v>

842
00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:22.481
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

843
00:24:22.481 --> 00:24:22.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

844
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.531

845
00:24:23.531 --> 00:24:23.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

846
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.820
<v Speaker 4>some interesting videos.</v>

847
00:24:24.821 --> 00:24:26.470
<v Speaker 4>And then there's one other thing.</v>

848
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:27.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

849
00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.320
<v Speaker 4>I had to hurry up because I had to be able to make it here.</v>

850
00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:30.161
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

851
00:24:30.161 --> 00:24:30.431
<v Speaker 1>how many,</v>

852
00:24:30.431 --> 00:24:31.590
<v Speaker 1>many minutes or videos?</v>

853
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:32.463
<v Speaker 1>Videos on average.</v>

854
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:34.360
<v Speaker 4>I get yelled at if they're young,</v>

855
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.700
<v Speaker 4>a long or the shorter than six minutes.</v>

856
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.570
<v Speaker 4>And yells at you.</v>

857
00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:38.320
<v Speaker 4>The Internet.</v>

858
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:38.690
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

859
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:39.523
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

860
00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.900
<v Speaker 4>because it used to be a two to three minutes show up because that would be the,</v>

861
00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:44.950
<v Speaker 4>the amount I could actually try and keep it interesting.</v>

862
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.540
<v Speaker 4>And then it slowly became this seven to 12 minutes show and so that's what it is</v>

863
00:24:49.541 --> 00:24:51.850
<v Speaker 4>usually a and yeah.</v>

864
00:24:51.851 --> 00:24:53.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to think if I ever go shorter.</v>

865
00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:54.090
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>

866
00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:57.450
<v Speaker 1>You could always put those pauses backend son now man.</v>

867
00:24:57.451 --> 00:25:01.770
<v Speaker 1>And people would see how strange that fucker out 10 to 15 minutes.</v>

868
00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm like I'm cringing inside with all my,</v>

869
00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.870

<v Speaker 1>subject of the threat or someone will send it to me on twitter.</v>

950
00:26:42.321 --> 00:26:43.590
<v Speaker 1>from any weird</v>

957
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.740

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:00.450
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

965
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:01.141
<v Speaker 5>but my parents,</v>

966
00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:01.561
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

967
00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:02.540
<v Speaker 5>they hated it first.</v>

968
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.001
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

969
00:27:03.001 --> 00:27:03.211
<v Speaker 5>Did.</v>

970
00:27:03.211 --> 00:27:03.511
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

971
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:04.130
<v Speaker 5>My,</v>

972
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:07.620
<v Speaker 5>well because we didn't know and made money for like the first first probably</v>

973
00:27:07.621 --> 00:27:08.460
<v Speaker 5>four years.</v>

974
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:09.061
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>

975
00:27:09.061 --> 00:27:09.541
<v Speaker 5>So they were like,</v>

976
00:27:09.541 --> 00:27:10.470
<v Speaker 5>you're wasting your time.</v>

977
00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:10.741
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

978
00:27:10.741 --> 00:27:11.574
<v Speaker 5>When I was in,</v>

979
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.430
<v Speaker 5>when I was going through a premed in North Carolina,</v>

980
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.680
<v Speaker 5>one of the big things was I,</v>

981
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.300
<v Speaker 5>my grades started slipping.</v>

982
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.060
<v Speaker 5>I was kind of just doing it because it was a hobby and I was going to stop</v>

983
00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:21.840
<v Speaker 5>making the videos.</v>

984
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.220
<v Speaker 5>But then youtube brought around the partner program which was just their way of</v>

985
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:27.890
<v Speaker 5>putting ads on it and you know,</v>

986
00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.550
<v Speaker 5>you got money and there were all these big promises and then it turned out like</v>

987
00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:33.150
<v Speaker 5>we were making pennies,</v>

988
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.131
<v Speaker 5>but it was,</v>

989
00:27:34.131 --> 00:27:35.580
<v Speaker 5>it was still like this revenue,</v>

990
00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:36.170
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>

991
00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:37.500
<v Speaker 5>which was amazing to me.</v>

992
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.720
<v Speaker 5>Like making youtube videos and making money from it.</v>

993
00:27:39.721 --> 00:27:43.170
<v Speaker 5>And now it's a whole thing because we're with discovery.</v>

994
00:27:43.171 --> 00:27:46.460
<v Speaker 5>We have like a sales team in New York and just weird it.</v>

995
00:27:46.461 --> 00:27:47.190
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

996
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.620
<v Speaker 5>but we didn't make money for the first four years.</v>

997
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:50.161
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

998
00:27:50.161 --> 00:27:51.390
<v Speaker 5>But that's why it's good.</v>

999
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.380
<v Speaker 5>It's kids like you did it because you were actually enjoying doing it and you</v>

1000
00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:57.360
<v Speaker 5>were enjoying the feedback and that sort of like an apprenticeship.</v>

1001
00:27:57.361 --> 00:27:59.490
<v Speaker 5>When you think about like to get a bachelor's degree,</v>

1002
00:27:59.491 --> 00:28:00.840
<v Speaker 5>you're doing for years,</v>

1003
00:28:00.841 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 5>so you did four years in youtube and then you graduated.</v>

1004
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.770
<v Speaker 5>It's the 10,000 hours,</v>

1005
00:28:04.771 --> 00:28:05.604
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1006
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:05.911
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1007
00:28:05.911 --> 00:28:06.601
<v Speaker 5>I mean Shit.</v>

1008
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:07.434
<v Speaker 5>10,000 hours.</v>

1009
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot.</v>

1010
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:10.030
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1011
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.760
<v Speaker 5>we haven't done 10,000 hours of podcasting thing.</v>

1012
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.280
<v Speaker 5>We've done 580 something podcasts.</v>

1013
00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:18.120
<v Speaker 5>That's three.</v>

1014
00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:20.730
<v Speaker 5>Not always three sometimes too.</v>

1015
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:21.721
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1016
00:28:21.721 --> 00:28:22.380
<v Speaker 5>That's not.</v>

1017
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.730
<v Speaker 5>It's not 10,000 hours.</v>

1018
00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.160
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking slot hours.</v>

1019
00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.140
<v Speaker 5>A long fucking time.</v>

1020
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:29.690
<v Speaker 5>But I mean it's,</v>

1021
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.080
<v Speaker 5>it's just the old school stuff and I don't know.</v>

1022
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.440
<v Speaker 5>Everyone kind of had to change along with it.</v>

1023
00:28:34.441 --> 00:28:37.380
<v Speaker 5>There were a lot of people that were making videos back then that hated the</v>

1024
00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:38.214
<v Speaker 5>prospect of,</v>

1025
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.053
<v Speaker 5>of money.</v>

1026
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.950
<v Speaker 5>That money was going to ruin it all.</v>

1027
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.400
<v Speaker 5>Like we're all going to be wearing like Pepsi shirts and it was all going to go</v>

1028
00:28:44.401 --> 00:28:44.880
<v Speaker 5>downhill,</v>

1029
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.930
<v Speaker 5>but you just have to.</v>

1030
00:28:45.931 --> 00:28:47.070
<v Speaker 5>You have to just change with it.</v>

1031
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:47.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1032
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.260
<v Speaker 5>That is the real fear,</v>

1033
00:28:49.261 --> 00:28:49.591
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1034
00:28:49.591 --> 00:28:53.550
<v Speaker 5>Is that corporate media comes in or corporate entities come in and buy you out,</v>

1035
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.640
<v Speaker 5>give you an old for.</v>

1036
00:28:54.641 --> 00:28:56.970
<v Speaker 5>You can refuse a next thing you know,</v>

1037
00:28:56.971 --> 00:28:59.910
<v Speaker 5>you can't talk about anything controversial.</v>

1038
00:28:59.911 --> 00:29:02.460
<v Speaker 5>You get asked to wear certain clothes,</v>

1039
00:29:02.461 --> 00:29:05.130
<v Speaker 5>you get asked to talk about certain movies.</v>

1040
00:29:05.131 --> 00:29:07.440
<v Speaker 5>It would be good if you could talk about the interview.</v>

1041
00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.240
<v Speaker 5>It's our new film that's coming out.</v>

1042
00:29:09.241 --> 00:29:10.200
<v Speaker 5>Philip DEFRANCO.</v>

1043
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you have a positive review of the interview.</v>

1044
00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:12.960
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1045
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.793
<v Speaker 5>that kind of shit.</v>

1046
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:14.131
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1047
00:29:14.131 --> 00:29:14.671
<v Speaker 5>We're slowly.</v>

1048
00:29:14.671 --> 00:29:18.610
<v Speaker 5>We have a segment called calls from Collin because um,</v>

1049
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:19.201
<v Speaker 5>because like I said,</v>

1050
00:29:19.201 --> 00:29:22.620
<v Speaker 5>some of the company was purchased by discovery and then we talked about the,</v>

1051
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:23.700
<v Speaker 5>was the,</v>

1052
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.840
<v Speaker 5>as the Anaconda video or the,</v>

1053
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.870
<v Speaker 5>which one was a two hour special of the guy that got.</v>

1054
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.350
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1055
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:33.000
<v Speaker 5>that asshole that didn't even get eaten and I just made fun of it and I just saw</v>

1056
00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:34.590
<v Speaker 5>that anytime anything is discovery and I'll be like,</v>

1057
00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:35.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking forward to your call,</v>

1058
00:29:35.551 --> 00:29:36.180
<v Speaker 5>Colin,</v>

1059
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.680
<v Speaker 5>because I know that it's going to come down.</v>

1060
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.071
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1061
00:29:38.071 --> 00:29:41.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the fuck they were thinking with that they put guy,</v>

1062
00:29:41.591 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 5>if you don't know</v>

1063
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.851
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about,</v>

1064
00:29:42.851 --> 00:29:45.430
<v Speaker 1>they put it was called eaten alive or something like that.</v>

1065
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:50.670
<v Speaker 1>And so they put this guy in this armored sort of suit and they covered his body</v>

1066
00:29:51.851 --> 00:29:56.410
<v Speaker 1>and pig blood and then they sort of fed him to an Anaconda.</v>

1067
00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:01.180
<v Speaker 1>So the Anaconda wraps its body around him and just starts breaking this guy's</v>

1068
00:30:01.181 --> 00:30:06.181
<v Speaker 1>body and he taps out this pussy never got eaten at all at all.</v>

1069
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Like that thing didn't even put a mouth on him.</v>

1070
00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:11.560
<v Speaker 1>It didn't even get its mouth over his head.</v>

1071
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1072
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:12.703
<v Speaker 1>it was A.</v>

1073
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1074
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I just sort of like bit.</v>

1075
00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little nibbled.</v>

1076
00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:17.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1077
00:30:17.341 --> 00:30:17.990
<v Speaker 1>you got nibbled.</v>

1078
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.630
<v Speaker 1>You got,</v>

1079
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:19.420
<v Speaker 1>you got hugged.</v>

1080
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.253
<v Speaker 1>He got cuddled.</v>

1081
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying creature.</v>

1082
00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:25.990
<v Speaker 1>He got hugged mean they are fucking unbelievably strong.</v>

1083
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:28.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that I was thinking of when I was.</v>

1084
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.530
<v Speaker 1>When I was hearing about this,</v>

1085
00:30:29.531 --> 00:30:29.831
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1086
00:30:29.831 --> 00:30:33.970
<v Speaker 1>well one of this guy is aware of what the pressure of that thing constricting</v>

1087
00:30:33.971 --> 00:30:34.720
<v Speaker 1>him is going to be like.</v>

1088
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Because even if you're in a suit,</v>

1089
00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:38.500
<v Speaker 1>you're probably not going to be able to breathe.</v>

1090
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Like the thing about what they do,</v>

1091
00:30:40.571 --> 00:30:42.460
<v Speaker 1>even if it doesn't swallow you whole,</v>

1092
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.640
<v Speaker 1>is they wait for you to take a breath and then when you exhale that clamped down</v>

1093
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.330
<v Speaker 1>so that you can't inhale again.</v>

1094
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>

1095
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:51.910
<v Speaker 1>It sounds so terrifying.</v>

1096
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1097
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.590
<v Speaker 1>they're the scariest things on the world.</v>

1098
00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1099
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.351
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1100
00:30:54.351 --> 00:30:55.300
<v Speaker 1>I would've done the same thing.</v>

1101
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.160
<v Speaker 1>I would've done the same thing was tapped out.</v>

1102
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1103
00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.653
<v Speaker 1>I would've never done it.</v>

1104
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:59.201
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

1105
00:30:59.201 --> 00:31:00.034
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

1106
00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>

1107
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1108
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it got great ratings.</v>

1109
00:31:02.601 --> 00:31:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1110
00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:03.760
<v Speaker 1>until they lied to us.</v>

1111
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.111
<v Speaker 1>They lied to us.</v>

1112
00:31:05.111 --> 00:31:06.810
<v Speaker 1>They had a two hour show where a guy,</v>

1113
00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:10.690
<v Speaker 1>they knew that fucking guy didn't get eaten and they called it eaten alive.</v>

1114
00:31:10.691 --> 00:31:13.140
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even get fucking halfway swallow,</v>

1115
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.560
<v Speaker 1>didn't even get his foot swallowed.</v>

1116
00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:15.993
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1117
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:16.991
<v Speaker 1>You think that's the way.</v>

1118
00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:17.741
<v Speaker 1>That's what went wrong.</v>

1119
00:31:17.741 --> 00:31:18.910
<v Speaker 1>He didn't start from the right way.</v>

1120
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1121
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.360
<v Speaker 1>they always start from the head and that's,</v>

1122
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.200
<v Speaker 1>that's the snakes choice.</v>

1123
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:23.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1124
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.210
<v Speaker 1>the snake gets to decide.</v>

1125
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:30.660
<v Speaker 1>What's really insane about anacondas is there's people in Brazil that swear that</v>

1126
00:31:30.701 --> 00:31:32.680
<v Speaker 1>they can get to 100 feet there.</v>

1127
00:31:32.681 --> 00:31:34.390
<v Speaker 1>There's people in Brazil,</v>

1128
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:39.400
<v Speaker 1>especially people that have seen them like a long time ago that have seen</v>

1129
00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:43.330
<v Speaker 1>enormous ones like we don't really know like what the biggest ones are have</v>

1130
00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:43.990
<v Speaker 1>anacondas.</v>

1131
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:45.820
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest ones I've ever captured.</v>

1132
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.670
<v Speaker 1>I've been like something like 30 or 40 feet or something like that,</v>

1133
00:31:48.671 --> 00:31:51.970
<v Speaker 1>but people believe that they can grow to 100 feet.</v>

1134
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.490
<v Speaker 1>I have joined it.</v>

1135
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.260
<v Speaker 1>You can tell me anything about anacondas and I'd be like,</v>

1136
00:31:56.261 --> 00:31:57.094
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

1137
00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:58.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to question it at all.</v>

1138
00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.310
<v Speaker 1>That's when you should.</v>

1139
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:02.700
<v Speaker 1>If it's coming out of my mouth for sure you should question it,</v>

1140
00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.200
<v Speaker 1>but they're there.</v>

1141
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:10.230
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea behind an animal or a snake that all what it does is grab a hold</v>

1142
00:32:12.161 --> 00:32:17.161
<v Speaker 1>of you and then wraps its body around you and crushes you and then swallows you</v>

1143
00:32:17.771 --> 00:32:18.430
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

1144
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you see them when they have something inside their body,</v>

1145
00:32:21.281 --> 00:32:24.400
<v Speaker 1>they can expand like they can swallow it.</v>

1146
00:32:24.401 --> 00:32:25.870
<v Speaker 1>These enormous animals.</v>

1147
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:27.243
<v Speaker 1>I'm not messing with that.</v>

1148
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going anywhere that could possibly happen,</v>

1149
00:32:30.461 --> 00:32:31.420
<v Speaker 1>ever know,</v>

1150
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.760
<v Speaker 1>but these goddamn discovery channel shows or any of these,</v>

1151
00:32:33.761 --> 00:32:35.040
<v Speaker 1>is that discovery it was discovered,</v>

1152
00:32:35.041 --> 00:32:35.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1153
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1154
00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:38.650
<v Speaker 1>There's so many of these goddamn shows where they're doing this now where</v>

1155
00:32:38.651 --> 00:32:38.900
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1156
00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:39.210
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1157
00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:43.490
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of baiting you in to watch them with these stents and then when you</v>

1158
00:32:43.491 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 1>actually do watch it,</v>

1159
00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:46.600
<v Speaker 1>like how about those Goddamn Mermaid?</v>

1160
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.733
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

1161
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.650
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

1162
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.130
<v Speaker 1>people believe that those animal planet shows were revealed.</v>

1163
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 1>These mermaids are real.</v>

1164
00:32:53.241 --> 00:32:55.640
<v Speaker 1>They never said that it was a piece of fiction.</v>

1165
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.713
<v Speaker 1>They never did.</v>

1166
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:58.640
<v Speaker 1>They made a documentary.</v>

1167
00:32:58.641 --> 00:32:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I'm talking about?</v>

1168
00:32:59.520 --> 00:32:59.791
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1169
00:32:59.791 --> 00:33:02.880
<v Speaker 4>I know that like I'm scarred because there was like,</v>

1170
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.610
<v Speaker 4>there was a show that was on Fox when it was,</v>

1171
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.570
<v Speaker 4>when I was like 10 years old and it was,</v>

1172
00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.940
<v Speaker 4>it was like I looked back and it was obviously fake,</v>

1173
00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:12.630
<v Speaker 4>but at no point during it did they say that this alien abduction thing was</v>

1174
00:33:12.631 --> 00:33:13.130
<v Speaker 4>faking?</v>

1175
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1176
00:33:14.451 --> 00:33:15.140
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1177
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:15.973
<v Speaker 1>For,</v>

1178
00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:16.953
<v Speaker 1>for years.</v>

1179
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:17.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1180
00:33:17.271 --> 00:33:22.130
<v Speaker 1>That one was crazy because no one ever took credit for that one.</v>

1181
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.173
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1182
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember what it is.</v>

1183
00:33:25.281 --> 00:33:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1184
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1185
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.940
<v Speaker 1>it's just in my brain of I was terrified of this for three,</v>

1186
00:33:28.941 --> 00:33:29.774
<v Speaker 1>four years.</v>

1187
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:30.441
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1189
00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:31.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1190
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:36.220
<v Speaker 1>that was one where everybody really was convinced that that was a real alien and</v>

1191
00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:40.580
<v Speaker 1>there was a bunch of people that were like supposedly special effects.</v>

1192
00:33:40.581 --> 00:33:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Designer just said we can't even do that.</v>

1193
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.120
<v Speaker 1>They always,</v>

1194
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.270
<v Speaker 1>they get some dummy that's like a makeup artist is like we're not even capable</v>

1195
00:33:47.271 --> 00:33:48.104
<v Speaker 1>of doing that today.</v>

1196
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:48.471
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1197
00:33:48.471 --> 00:33:48.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1198
00:33:48.681 --> 00:33:50.690
<v Speaker 1>you talked to like Rick Baker characters like A.</v>

1199
00:33:50.691 --> 00:33:50.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1200
00:33:50.901 --> 00:33:51.681
<v Speaker 1>we are like,</v>

1201
00:33:51.681 --> 00:33:53.000
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

1202
00:33:53.001 --> 00:33:53.834
<v Speaker 1>You assholes,</v>

1203
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:57.860
<v Speaker 1>but all you need is one person to get on camera and say that.</v>

1204
00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.040
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1205
00:33:59.180 --> 00:33:59.510
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

1206
00:33:59.510 --> 00:33:59.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1207
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:00.111
<v Speaker 4>whoever,</v>

1208
00:34:00.111 --> 00:34:01.220
<v Speaker 4>whoever made that was the guy.</v>

1209
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:05.240
<v Speaker 4>Like that's how he was able to get a drastic park because like if you look at</v>

1210
00:34:05.241 --> 00:34:05.721
<v Speaker 4>drastic park,</v>

1211
00:34:05.721 --> 00:34:06.554
<v Speaker 4>that shit's awesome.</v>

1212
00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:08.120
<v Speaker 4>Like that's all CGI though.</v>

1213
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:08.901
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1214
00:34:08.901 --> 00:34:11.570
<v Speaker 4>but I mean I'm talking about like the first one compared to where we are today.</v>

1215
00:34:11.571 --> 00:34:12.860
<v Speaker 4>Like if you look at the first one,</v>

1216
00:34:12.861 --> 00:34:13.460
<v Speaker 4>how</v>

1217
00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.000
<v Speaker 1>vanced two amazing ones.</v>

1218
00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1219
00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I just watched it the other day with my four year old.</v>

1220
00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.820
<v Speaker 1>She was not digging it.</v>

1221
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Six year old loved it.</v>

1222
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:22.580
<v Speaker 1>The four year old was like,</v>

1223
00:34:22.581 --> 00:34:23.570
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

1224
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:28.240
<v Speaker 1>She buried her head in her mom's lap and started crying and screaming when,</v>

1225
00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:30.140
<v Speaker 1>when the t rex was chasing the cheap,</v>

1226
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.940
<v Speaker 1>she checked out right there.</v>

1227
00:34:31.941 --> 00:34:33.200
<v Speaker 1>That was enough.</v>

1228
00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:34.243
<v Speaker 1>She was fine.</v>

1229
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:35.450
<v Speaker 1>When the Brontosaurus is,</v>

1230
00:34:35.451 --> 00:34:36.380
<v Speaker 1>we're moving around,</v>

1231
00:34:36.381 --> 00:34:39.200
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as the t rex came around and ate the goat,</v>

1232
00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.420
<v Speaker 1>it was all downhill from there.</v>

1233
00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:42.361
<v Speaker 4>Point is,</v>

1234
00:34:42.361 --> 00:34:47.000
<v Speaker 4>it is super important to stay away from scary TV for kids because I have a new</v>

1235
00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:47.220
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

1236
00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:47.350
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

1237
00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:48.240
<v Speaker 1>a good question.</v>

1238
00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.261
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1239
00:34:49.261 --> 00:34:50.094
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1240
00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:50.551
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1241
00:34:50.551 --> 00:34:51.690
<v Speaker 1>what is scary?</v>

1242
00:34:51.691 --> 00:34:51.931
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1243
00:34:51.931 --> 00:34:56.010
<v Speaker 1>it's good to expose them to reality in a certain sense.</v>

1244
00:34:56.011 --> 00:34:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Like to let them know that there's good people,</v>

1245
00:34:57.781 --> 00:35:01.530
<v Speaker 1>but there's also the potential bad people without actually bringing them to</v>

1246
00:35:01.531 --> 00:35:02.101
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>

1247
00:35:02.101 --> 00:35:02.281
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

1248
00:35:02.281 --> 00:35:02.551
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1249
00:35:02.551 --> 00:35:03.100
<v Speaker 1>these are the guys,</v>

1250
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.260
<v Speaker 1>the tattoos on their face.</v>

1251
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Stay away from them son.</v>

1252
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.131
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1253
00:35:08.131 --> 00:35:08.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1254
00:35:08.731 --> 00:35:09.564
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1255
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question.</v>

1256
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Like I think we're entirely too scared as a culture by media in a certain way.</v>

1257
00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1258
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I know people that just watch those God damn serial killer shows,</v>

1259
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:21.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1260
00:35:21.661 --> 00:35:25.470
<v Speaker 1>those shows where they profile serial killers or talk about serial killers or,</v>

1261
00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:29.310
<v Speaker 1>or they talk about love gone wrong and you know this.</v>

1262
00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.940
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who watches all of those.</v>

1263
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.560
<v Speaker 1>All those hasn't Dvr,</v>

1264
00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.850
<v Speaker 1>just can't,</v>

1265
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:39.960
<v Speaker 1>can't turn from these goddamn shows on psychos.</v>

1266
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.211
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1267
00:35:40.211 --> 00:35:40.721
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

1268
00:35:40.721 --> 00:35:40.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1269
00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:45.250
<v Speaker 4>I think like the demo of that are 60 year old women at home.</v>

1270
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:46.543
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty.</v>

1271
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:47.711
<v Speaker 4>It's murder part.</v>

1272
00:35:47.711 --> 00:35:48.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1273
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:49.390
<v Speaker 4>It is murder porn.</v>

1274
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1275
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:49.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1276
00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:51.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what Duncan Gaza to.</v>

1277
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1278
00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.190
<v Speaker 1>That's really the best way to describe it.</v>

1279
00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:53.551
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>

1280
00:35:53.551 --> 00:35:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you get some sort of a weird thrill out of like listening to this story about</v>

1281
00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:02.751
<v Speaker 1>how this guy bought all this acid and say saved it up and you know,</v>

1282
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.410
<v Speaker 1>got a tub and put it in the woods and chop the lady up and you'll choose.</v>

1283
00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.250
<v Speaker 4>Well it's like CSI,</v>

1284
00:36:09.251 --> 00:36:10.180
<v Speaker 4>but real life,</v>

1285
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:11.170
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1286
00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:12.003
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1287
00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:12.581
<v Speaker 4>That is weird.</v>

1288
00:36:12.581 --> 00:36:14.770
<v Speaker 4>When you see them in court and the shackle do like that.</v>

1289
00:36:14.771 --> 00:36:15.551
<v Speaker 4>The guy that did it,</v>

1290
00:36:15.551 --> 00:36:16.930
<v Speaker 4>that fucking guy really did it.</v>

1291
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1292
00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:18.363
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1293
00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.691
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not above it.</v>

1294
00:36:19.691 --> 00:36:19.841
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1295
00:36:19.841 --> 00:36:20.470
<v Speaker 4>I know that I,</v>

1296
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:25.470
<v Speaker 4>I searched a lot like forever on itunes and all over the web to to watch a show</v>

1297
00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:26.951
<v Speaker 4>called.</v>

1298
00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:29.280
<v Speaker 4>It was like the first 48 and I was just,</v>

1299
00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:30.910
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to go through the top 10 and I was like,</v>

1300
00:36:30.911 --> 00:36:31.061
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1301
00:36:31.061 --> 00:36:32.110
<v Speaker 4>this is a terrifying.</v>

1302
00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:34.420
<v Speaker 4>And it's like the number one is,</v>

1303
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:39.400
<v Speaker 4>it's just like a guy killed seven people and they're all a part of his family</v>

1304
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:40.900
<v Speaker 4>and it all and you're just like,</v>

1305
00:36:40.901 --> 00:36:43.060
<v Speaker 4>what is this is like life.</v>

1306
00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:43.923
<v Speaker 4>This is like,</v>

1307
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.823
<v Speaker 4>how do you do that?</v>

1308
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.420
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird,</v>

1309
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:54.320
<v Speaker 1>like a weird reality that some people can go off the rail completely and just</v>

1310
00:36:55.591 --> 00:36:56.820
<v Speaker 1>kill everyone in their family,</v>

1311
00:36:56.821 --> 00:36:57.880
<v Speaker 1>including kids.</v>

1312
00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.110
<v Speaker 1>They can kill their kids.</v>

1313
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.571
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>

1314
00:37:00.571 --> 00:37:01.404
<v Speaker 1>That scares me.</v>

1315
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1316
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:06.600
<v Speaker 4>Because I have a son now that's a seven and a half months and I just,</v>

1317
00:37:06.601 --> 00:37:07.530
<v Speaker 4>everyday when you look at the news,</v>

1318
00:37:07.531 --> 00:37:08.270
<v Speaker 4>it's like this,</v>

1319
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:09.103
<v Speaker 4>this child.</v>

1320
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:09.390
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1321
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:10.223
<v Speaker 4>because in New York,</v>

1322
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:14.010
<v Speaker 4>that kid or that guy cut his mom's head off and kicked through the street on</v>

1323
00:37:14.011 --> 00:37:14.844
<v Speaker 4>Halloween,</v>

1324
00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:15.660
<v Speaker 4>like that's a.</v>

1325
00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.400
<v Speaker 4>that's a thing that mom was account though</v>

1326
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.020
<v Speaker 1>I heard she was a con.</v>

1327
00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Like in church.</v>

1328
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.990
<v Speaker 1>She was always telling him to turn the TV down.</v>

1329
00:37:23.991 --> 00:37:24.824
<v Speaker 1>Shit like that.</v>

1330
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Go to bed.</v>

1331
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1332
00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:27.771
<v Speaker 1>She was always telling them,</v>

1333
00:37:27.771 --> 00:37:28.281
<v Speaker 1>pay rent.</v>

1334
00:37:28.281 --> 00:37:28.940
<v Speaker 1>You gotta pay rent.</v>

1335
00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:29.773
<v Speaker 1>Fuck her.</v>

1336
00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:30.890
<v Speaker 1>She made him.</v>

1337
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:32.270
<v Speaker 1>He didn't ask to be born.</v>

1338
00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.790
<v Speaker 4>Did you hear about this video game?</v>

1339
00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.200
<v Speaker 4>Actually you covered it the other day.</v>

1340
00:37:36.201 --> 00:37:36.860
<v Speaker 4>Hatred.</v>

1341
00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1342
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.020
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

1343
00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:38.220
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1344
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:41.330
<v Speaker 4>is that the one where you had the video asking if it should be censored?</v>

1345
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:41.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1346
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:46.490
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those things where I look at the game and I try and think of</v>

1347
00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:50.420
<v Speaker 4>everything that I've played in the past and I've played super,</v>

1348
00:37:50.421 --> 00:37:54.740
<v Speaker 4>super gory violent games like manhunts and I loved it and like you're looking at</v>

1349
00:37:54.741 --> 00:37:56.510
<v Speaker 4>strat guides on how to get the more,</v>

1350
00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:57.860
<v Speaker 4>the more vicious,</v>

1351
00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.110
<v Speaker 4>more vicious kill on someone in a manhunt.</v>

1352
00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:03.620
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's more of just from the outset,</v>

1353
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:05.570
<v Speaker 4>the way that it's being portrayed as it seems like,</v>

1354
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:06.051
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1355
00:38:06.051 --> 00:38:06.291
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1356
00:38:06.291 --> 00:38:09.050
<v Speaker 4>that guy that goes to a movie theater and kills everyone.</v>

1357
00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.190
<v Speaker 4>What if you were that guy?</v>

1358
00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.550
<v Speaker 4>And so and so it's,</v>

1359
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:14.600
<v Speaker 4>it's a game that I don't know if I'm going to play,</v>

1360
00:38:14.601 --> 00:38:16.160
<v Speaker 4>I might play it so that I can cover it.</v>

1361
00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:19.250
<v Speaker 4>But I also understand that yeah,</v>

1362
00:38:19.251 --> 00:38:20.420
<v Speaker 4>maybe it shouldn't be censored,</v>

1363
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1364
00:38:20.721 --> 00:38:21.554
<v Speaker 4>that's my,</v>

1365
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:22.180
<v Speaker 4>that's my thing.</v>

1366
00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.590
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those things that's a gray area for me.</v>

1367
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.880
<v Speaker 4>Fucking crazy people's head off with a shotgun.</v>

1368
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:28.671
<v Speaker 4>There was also a scene.</v>

1369
00:38:28.671 --> 00:38:28.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1370
00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.230
<v Speaker 4>the massive stabbing.</v>

1371
00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.810
<v Speaker 4>And so it's one of those for me,</v>

1372
00:38:32.811 --> 00:38:34.540
<v Speaker 4>it is something where I'm like,</v>

1373
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:40.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to get where I try and get past myself because my reaction and I.</v>

1374
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.800
<v Speaker 5>you're not showing this on the show,</v>

1375
00:38:42.801 --> 00:38:43.634
<v Speaker 5>are you?</v>

1376
00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:43.921
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1377
00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:44.641
<v Speaker 5>just pieces of it.</v>

1378
00:38:44.641 --> 00:38:44.740
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1379
00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:45.511
<v Speaker 5>it's a video game.</v>

1380
00:38:45.511 --> 00:38:48.390
<v Speaker 5>Trailer Video Games though.</v>

1381
00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:48.840
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

1382
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.250
<v Speaker 5>But don't just in case.</v>

1383
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:51.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1384
00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.930
<v Speaker 5>But so we get pulled off youtube for everything.</v>

1385
00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:54.421
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1386
00:38:54.421 --> 00:38:57.780
<v Speaker 5>We showed nature videos and anytime we show a video and we go over and talk</v>

1387
00:38:57.781 --> 00:38:58.291
<v Speaker 5>about the video,</v>

1388
00:38:58.291 --> 00:39:02.550
<v Speaker 5>we get pulled for some youtube copyright fucking horseshit,</v>

1389
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:04.380
<v Speaker 5>but it's a good point.</v>

1390
00:39:04.381 --> 00:39:05.310
<v Speaker 5>Like what,</v>

1391
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.370
<v Speaker 5>at what point in time as a culture do we say,</v>

1392
00:39:08.371 --> 00:39:09.060
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1393
00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.170
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is this?</v>

1394
00:39:10.171 --> 00:39:15.000
<v Speaker 5>Like this isn't even like a hero is going around killing bad guys in a very</v>

1395
00:39:15.001 --> 00:39:15.780
<v Speaker 5>violent manner.</v>

1396
00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:16.800
<v Speaker 5>Like you just like.</v>

1397
00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:18.290
<v Speaker 5>So that's certainly killing people.</v>

1398
00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:18.981
<v Speaker 4>So that's like,</v>

1399
00:39:18.981 --> 00:39:19.801
<v Speaker 4>that's the main difference.</v>

1400
00:39:19.801 --> 00:39:21.510
<v Speaker 4>When someone makes a comparison to manhunt,</v>

1401
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.470
<v Speaker 4>it's usually you think,</v>

1402
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.100
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1403
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.480
<v Speaker 4>bad guy or you know,</v>

1404
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.180
<v Speaker 4>crazy backstory guy killing other bad guys.</v>

1405
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:27.840
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1406
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.710
<v Speaker 4>this with just kind of a mass killing of innocent people.</v>

1407
00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:33.410
<v Speaker 4>You also have to wonder,</v>

1408
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:34.800
<v Speaker 4>we've only seen one trailer,</v>

1409
00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:35.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1410
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:35.551
<v Speaker 4>is there,</v>

1411
00:39:35.551 --> 00:39:37.780
<v Speaker 4>is there something where there is,</v>

1412
00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:41.100
<v Speaker 4>there is a story there or is it just intended to make people angry?</v>

1413
00:39:41.101 --> 00:39:42.600
<v Speaker 4>But I always look at video games,</v>

1414
00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.553
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1415
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:43.861
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

1416
00:39:43.861 --> 00:39:44.401
<v Speaker 4>some aren't,</v>

1417
00:39:44.401 --> 00:39:47.280
<v Speaker 4>but some I think are like any form of entertainment,</v>

1418
00:39:47.281 --> 00:39:48.114
<v Speaker 4>art in some way,</v>

1419
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.651
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1420
00:39:48.651 --> 00:39:49.020
<v Speaker 4>it is,</v>

1421
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:49.161
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1422
00:39:49.161 --> 00:39:51.870
<v Speaker 4>is it supposed to make you really nervous,</v>

1423
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:52.171
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1424
00:39:52.171 --> 00:39:53.160
<v Speaker 4>Like when you see that and you're like,</v>

1425
00:39:53.161 --> 00:39:54.240
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>

1426
00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.040
<v Speaker 4>like that's fucking crazy.</v>

1427
00:39:56.041 --> 00:39:58.260
<v Speaker 4>How is this a thing for me?</v>

1428
00:39:58.261 --> 00:39:59.100
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1429
00:39:59.101 --> 00:39:59.341
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1430
00:39:59.341 --> 00:39:59.920
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1431
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.721
<v Speaker 4>that's a good thing.</v>

1432
00:40:00.721 --> 00:40:01.531
<v Speaker 4>It's a conversation.</v>

1433
00:40:01.531 --> 00:40:06.531
<v Speaker 4>It's something that goes a step deeper and that kid right that they've said</v>

1434
00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:11.040
<v Speaker 4>killed someone because of grand theft auto call of duty.</v>

1435
00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is just going to get tagged on.</v>

1436
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:15.990
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that guy plays that game,</v>

1437
00:40:15.991 --> 00:40:19.290
<v Speaker 4>but I know that I play grand theft auto and I run over people.</v>

1438
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.610
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't do that in real life.</v>

1439
00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:21.690
<v Speaker 4>Not a psychopath</v>

1440
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:23.830
<v Speaker 5>do because it's a goof because you also,</v>

1441
00:40:23.831 --> 00:40:24.131
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1442
00:40:24.131 --> 00:40:25.450
<v Speaker 5>there are not real people.</v>

1443
00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:25.871
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1444
00:40:25.871 --> 00:40:27.100
<v Speaker 5>And it's kind of naughty,</v>

1445
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.340
<v Speaker 5>naughty to just run people over for fun.</v>

1446
00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:33.170
<v Speaker 5>You just highlighting what will you just highlight the,</v>

1447
00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.450
<v Speaker 5>the actual game.</v>

1448
00:40:34.451 --> 00:40:37.360
<v Speaker 5>Like the description of the games kind of fucked up though.</v>

1449
00:40:37.361 --> 00:40:37.841
<v Speaker 5>It says,</v>

1450
00:40:37.841 --> 00:40:38.050
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1451
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:38.591
<v Speaker 5>he says like,</v>

1452
00:40:38.591 --> 00:40:41.800
<v Speaker 5>I just hate the world and the human worms feasting on its carcass.</v>

1453
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.180
<v Speaker 5>My whole life is just cold,</v>

1454
00:40:43.181 --> 00:40:47.740
<v Speaker 5>bitter hatred and I always wanted to die violently the time for vengeance and no</v>

1455
00:40:47.741 --> 00:40:51.100
<v Speaker 5>life is worth saving and I'll put in a grave as many as I can.</v>

1456
00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:53.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean that alone is just like crazy.</v>

1457
00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.160
<v Speaker 5>Like he get to be Michael Myers from Halloween,</v>

1458
00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.113
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1459
00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:01.840
<v Speaker 5>if he played Halloween and you've got to be the psycho,</v>

1460
00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.040
<v Speaker 5>is that a valid piece of art because people are running away from you,</v>

1461
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.770
<v Speaker 5>but is that only valid if you're the good guy?</v>

1462
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:08.981
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1463
00:41:08.981 --> 00:41:12.130
<v Speaker 5>but that's a little bit of fake compared to this is realistic.</v>

1464
00:41:12.131 --> 00:41:15.800
<v Speaker 5>This is you going into a mall and killing cops and children and stabbing them</v>

1465
00:41:15.801 --> 00:41:18.700
<v Speaker 5>and blowing their heads off with shotguns where Jason's like a monster that</v>

1466
00:41:18.701 --> 00:41:19.990
<v Speaker 5>lives in a lake or something.</v>

1467
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:21.063
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1468
00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:21.990
<v Speaker 5>That's a good point.</v>

1469
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:23.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1470
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean obviously I don't want to have anything to do with it.</v>

1471
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:27.310
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to plant,</v>

1472
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 5>but should it be censored as the real question?</v>

1473
00:41:29.951 --> 00:41:30.121
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1474
00:41:30.121 --> 00:41:30.280
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1475
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.400
<v Speaker 4>So what happened was it was taken off of,</v>

1476
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.811
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1477
00:41:32.811 --> 00:41:33.500
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1478
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.230
<v Speaker 4>and then it was put back on once a,</v>

1479
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.010
<v Speaker 4>one of the homeowners looked into it.</v>

1480
00:41:37.011 --> 00:41:37.491
<v Speaker 4>And was like,</v>

1481
00:41:37.491 --> 00:41:38.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't think this is a valid reason,</v>

1482
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:40.430
<v Speaker 4>this is us making it too personal.</v>

1483
00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.750
<v Speaker 4>This was part of a game coming to the forefront because people voted for it to</v>

1484
00:41:44.751 --> 00:41:45.051
<v Speaker 4>be up.</v>

1485
00:41:45.051 --> 00:41:48.110
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's because they wanted to troll the general public or because they</v>

1486
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.340
<v Speaker 4>wanted to generally play this game and it,</v>

1487
00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:50.481
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1488
00:41:50.481 --> 00:41:50.611
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1489
00:41:50.611 --> 00:41:51.680
<v Speaker 4>it is always the question,</v>

1490
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:56.000
<v Speaker 4>are we protecting people by it not being a thing or are we just telling grown</v>

1491
00:41:56.001 --> 00:41:57.980
<v Speaker 4>adults what they're allowed to do?</v>

1492
00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1493
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:59.550
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>

1494
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:00.410
<v Speaker 1>that is the question,</v>

1495
00:42:00.411 --> 00:42:00.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1496
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:01.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1497
00:42:01.191 --> 00:42:01.430
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

1498
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:03.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I say it's a gray area because you know,</v>

1499
00:42:03.261 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 1>kids are going to get a hold of this and who becomes the arbiter of common sense</v>

1500
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:11.330
<v Speaker 1>or decency becomes the who becomes the judge as to what is and is not</v>

1501
00:42:11.331 --> 00:42:12.860
<v Speaker 1>detrimental to society.</v>

1502
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.530
<v Speaker 1>That looks like detrimental to me.</v>

1503
00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:20.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like you're entering into that realm of like the full extreme like,</v>

1504
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1505
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:23.690
<v Speaker 1>like faces of death.</v>

1506
00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Is that a,</v>

1507
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:25.243
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

1508
00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:25.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1509
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.510
<v Speaker 1>when you watch those faces,</v>

1510
00:42:26.511 --> 00:42:26.721
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

1511
00:42:26.721 --> 00:42:30.010
<v Speaker 1>is that actually entertainment or you just freaking yourself out watching</v>

1512
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:33.160
<v Speaker 1>horrific things and who the fuck has filming that stuff?</v>

1513
00:42:33.161 --> 00:42:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Snuff films,</v>

1514
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:34.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1515
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:35.060
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1516
00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.260
<v Speaker 1>who's filming those things?</v>

1517
00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.310
<v Speaker 4>Were faces of death real.</v>

1518
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.333
<v Speaker 4>Some of them.</v>

1519
00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.100
<v Speaker 4>There was news footage mixed with fake.</v>

1520
00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:41.840
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it was?</v>

1521
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.031
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1522
00:42:42.031 --> 00:42:43.950
<v Speaker 4>I just know that I went out when that was a thing.</v>

1523
00:42:43.951 --> 00:42:45.120
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like 10 years ago,</v>

1524
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.193
<v Speaker 4>like an east.</v>

1525
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:47.551
<v Speaker 4>I was just like,</v>

1526
00:42:47.551 --> 00:42:49.110
<v Speaker 4>I was freaked out by the idea and I never wanted to.</v>

1527
00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

1528
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1529
00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:50.560
<v Speaker 1>How much of faces?</v>

1530
00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Death is fake?</v>

1531
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Like we're real.</v>

1532
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Someone like the guy who shot himself in the head,</v>

1533
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.020
<v Speaker 1>the cop or the,</v>

1534
00:42:57.021 --> 00:42:57.221
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1535
00:42:57.221 --> 00:42:58.670
<v Speaker 1>the judge in the courtroom.</v>

1536
00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:00.320
<v Speaker 1>That was that faces of death.</v>

1537
00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1538
00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1539
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.780
<v Speaker 1>there was like the train,</v>

1540
00:43:02.781 --> 00:43:04.520
<v Speaker 1>the woman running across getting that was real.</v>

1541
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:05.091
<v Speaker 1>That was real.</v>

1542
00:43:05.091 --> 00:43:06.400
<v Speaker 1>But then like the blood orange,</v>

1543
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.210
<v Speaker 1>which was my favorite part growing up,</v>

1544
00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:08.661
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1545
00:43:08.661 --> 00:43:12.570
<v Speaker 1>that was fake and where everyone's fucking and yeah,</v>

1546
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.280
<v Speaker 1>that was great.</v>

1547
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.220
<v Speaker 1>What about when they knocked a monkey over the head and ate its brains?</v>

1548
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that was fake,</v>

1549
00:43:17.241 --> 00:43:20.300
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not sure what that one where they're knocking it with a little hammer</v>

1550
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.900
<v Speaker 1>and then they take the monkey brains out like stir and then eat it.</v>

1551
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:25.101
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1552
00:43:25.101 --> 00:43:30.101
<v Speaker 1>the worst thing you could ever eat on a monkey is the brains because of monkeys,</v>

1553
00:43:30.371 --> 00:43:31.940
<v Speaker 1>like really close to a human being.</v>

1554
00:43:31.941 --> 00:43:33.440
<v Speaker 1>That'd be like eating human brains,</v>

1555
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:36.630
<v Speaker 1>which is how they get prions.</v>

1556
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:40.340
<v Speaker 1>That's how those guys New Guinea wind up getting Jacob crutchfield disease.</v>

1557
00:43:40.341 --> 00:43:41.570
<v Speaker 1>The same thing as mad cow.</v>

1558
00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1559
00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:44.150
<v Speaker 1>you get it from eating brain tissue.</v>

1560
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Cows get it from eating brain tissue of other cows.</v>

1561
00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.810
<v Speaker 1>It's some neurological disease that come.</v>

1562
00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:52.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like nature's protection from cannibalism.</v>

1563
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Nature's nature.</v>

1564
00:43:54.171 --> 00:43:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Like if you become someone who prays on the same species as you,</v>

1565
00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:03.140
<v Speaker 1>nature has sort of this built in fail safe mechanism to make your body shut</v>

1566
00:44:03.141 --> 00:44:03.970
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1567
00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:05.170
<v Speaker 4>I like stuff like that.</v>

1568
00:44:05.171 --> 00:44:08.140
<v Speaker 4>I get if you're in an area where that's the only thing,</v>

1569
00:44:08.141 --> 00:44:08.770
<v Speaker 4>but when.</v>

1570
00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:10.060
<v Speaker 4>When I think of brain,</v>

1571
00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.320
<v Speaker 4>like someone eating monkey brains,</v>

1572
00:44:11.321 --> 00:44:13.780
<v Speaker 4>I just imagine like some guy that has way too much money.</v>

1573
00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:14.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1574
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:16.180
<v Speaker 4>Just everything in life is boring and he's like,</v>

1575
00:44:16.181 --> 00:44:17.014
<v Speaker 4>let's do this.</v>

1576
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:17.441
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1577
00:44:17.441 --> 00:44:20.010
<v Speaker 4>Some like most dangerous game type dude.</v>

1578
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:20.560
<v Speaker 4>Once a month,</v>

1579
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:25.560
<v Speaker 4>humans releases them from his mansion and attracts them through his country.</v>

1580
00:44:26.351 --> 00:44:26.990
<v Speaker 4>Estate.</v>

1581
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1582
00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.520

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1595
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:55.780
<v Speaker 3>When you bring up video games,</v>

1596
00:44:55.781 --> 00:44:58.540
<v Speaker 3>this is an interesting time with video games as well because there's all this</v>

1597
00:44:58.541 --> 00:45:00.160
<v Speaker 3>Gamergate shit going on.</v>

1598
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.461
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1599
00:45:00.461 --> 00:45:02.320
<v Speaker 3>this always saw this,</v>

1600
00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:07.860
<v Speaker 3>this take on women in gaming and feminism and gaming and you know,</v>

1601
00:45:07.931 --> 00:45:10.120
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people think that certain segments of,</v>

1602
00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:14.530
<v Speaker 3>of gaming has been cooperated by extreme feminism's.</v>

1603
00:45:14.531 --> 00:45:16.030
<v Speaker 3>Pauly shore is dead now,</v>

1604
00:45:16.031 --> 00:45:16.864
<v Speaker 3>but that was,</v>

1605
00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:17.711
<v Speaker 3>that was different.</v>

1606
00:45:17.711 --> 00:45:18.544
<v Speaker 3>That was a new one.</v>

1607
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:19.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1608
00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:19.751
<v Speaker 3>Pauly shore.</v>

1609
00:45:19.751 --> 00:45:21.110
<v Speaker 3>His Dad was like him.</v>

1610
00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.420
<v Speaker 3>He was faking his own death,</v>

1611
00:45:22.421 --> 00:45:23.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1612
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:23.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1613
00:45:23.591 --> 00:45:24.210
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

1614
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:27.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that was a movie he maybe I'm thinking of something else.</v>

1615
00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1616
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.511
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

1617
00:45:28.511 --> 00:45:32.320
<v Speaker 3>But there was a definitely an ice tea version and there was a really old version</v>

1618
00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:36.370
<v Speaker 3>called the most dangerous game and I think it's based on an old book or an old</v>

1619
00:45:36.371 --> 00:45:36.851
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>

1620
00:45:36.851 --> 00:45:38.710
<v Speaker 3>at least perhaps a short story.</v>

1621
00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:40.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1622
00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:40.981
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1623
00:45:40.981 --> 00:45:41.761
<v Speaker 4>that Gamergate stuff.</v>

1624
00:45:41.761 --> 00:45:42.750
<v Speaker 4>I just try and stay.</v>

1625
00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:43.920
<v Speaker 4>I just try and stay away,</v>

1626
00:45:43.921 --> 00:45:44.430
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1627
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:45.480
<v Speaker 4>It's too much.</v>

1628
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:45.721
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1629
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:48.180
<v Speaker 4>there are people that are having an actual conversation and then there are</v>

1630
00:45:48.181 --> 00:45:49.950
<v Speaker 4>people that think they're actually having a conversation.</v>

1631
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:51.060
<v Speaker 4>They're just yelling at each other.</v>

1632
00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:51.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1633
00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:52.201
<v Speaker 4>and then.</v>

1634
00:45:52.201 --> 00:45:56.010
<v Speaker 4>And then obviously then you have the harassment and it just,</v>

1635
00:45:56.011 --> 00:45:56.850
<v Speaker 4>any way you touch it,</v>

1636
00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:58.290
<v Speaker 4>it's bad.</v>

1637
00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:58.631
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1638
00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:00.030
<v Speaker 3>the harassments awful,</v>

1639
00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:00.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1640
00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:02.920
<v Speaker 3>and the feminism,</v>

1641
00:46:02.921 --> 00:46:04.910
<v Speaker 3>the overreaction and the,</v>

1642
00:46:04.911 --> 00:46:05.130
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1643
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:08.440
<v Speaker 3>the overreaching and some of the most ridiculous,</v>

1644
00:46:08.441 --> 00:46:12.880
<v Speaker 3>ludicrous points about toxic masculinity and attaching that to like school</v>

1645
00:46:12.881 --> 00:46:14.070
<v Speaker 3>shootings and things on.</v>

1646
00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:15.310
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous too.</v>

1647
00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:18.340
<v Speaker 3>But it's not hurting anybody.</v>

1648
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:19.090
<v Speaker 3>Like they're just,</v>

1649
00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:20.380
<v Speaker 3>they just have goofy opinions,</v>

1650
00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.700
<v Speaker 3>like with the,</v>

1651
00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:26.050
<v Speaker 3>the harassment is the worst part of it and I think the harassment that's coming</v>

1652
00:46:26.051 --> 00:46:28.330
<v Speaker 3>from the side of the pro Gamer gators,</v>

1653
00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:30.250
<v Speaker 3>it's only a few people,</v>

1654
00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.260
<v Speaker 3>but it fucks up the whole conversation.</v>

1655
00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:34.120
<v Speaker 3>I think most people are like,</v>

1656
00:46:34.121 --> 00:46:34.900
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1657
00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:38.230
<v Speaker 3>we want to watch video games that have girls with big tits.</v>

1658
00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:39.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1659
00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:39.761
<v Speaker 3>We want to.</v>

1660
00:46:39.761 --> 00:46:40.630
<v Speaker 3>And it's okay.</v>

1661
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:45.190
<v Speaker 3>It's just like it's okay to have big tits and porn just like it's okay to,</v>

1662
00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:46.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1663
00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:46.620
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1664
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:49.000
<v Speaker 3>it's their goddamn like superheroes.</v>

1665
00:46:49.001 --> 00:46:49.421
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1666
00:46:49.421 --> 00:46:50.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like comic book stuff.</v>

1667
00:46:50.681 --> 00:46:52.000
<v Speaker 3>It's not supposed to be real.</v>

1668
00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:53.920
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to represent reality.</v>

1669
00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:57.790
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's phoenix from thex men or whether it's,</v>

1670
00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:58.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1671
00:46:58.301 --> 00:46:59.320
<v Speaker 3>Laura Croft,</v>

1672
00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.221
<v Speaker 3>tomb raider,</v>

1673
00:47:00.221 --> 00:47:03.730
<v Speaker 3>like cartoonish representations of human beings is fine.</v>

1674
00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:04.780
<v Speaker 3>Just like he man,</v>

1675
00:47:04.781 --> 00:47:07.780
<v Speaker 3>master of the universe was not anti male.</v>

1676
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:08.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1677
00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.840
<v Speaker 3>when you have these women that have these ridiculous proportions and you know,</v>

1678
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.440
<v Speaker 3>they have stereotypical roles in these movies.</v>

1679
00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:16.270
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean the movie's bad.</v>

1680
00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:18.340
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean it's detrimental to society.</v>

1681
00:47:18.341 --> 00:47:22.870
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean it's detrimental towards a male female relations or female</v>

1682
00:47:22.871 --> 00:47:23.651
<v Speaker 3>empowerment.</v>

1683
00:47:23.651 --> 00:47:25.450
<v Speaker 3>That's nonsense is nonsense,</v>

1684
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:26.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1685
00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:29.140
<v Speaker 3>people will treat human</v>

1686
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.390
<v Speaker 5>how they are going to treat them based on how they grew up based on the</v>

1687
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:37.390
<v Speaker 5>education they received based on a lot of variables.</v>

1688
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:40.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't think video games factors that heavily into that.</v>

1689
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.730
<v Speaker 5>I feel like the reason video games are there,</v>

1690
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:42.920
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1691
00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:43.930
<v Speaker 5>it's a soft target.</v>

1692
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.380
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1693
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.213
<v Speaker 5>and it's just,</v>

1694
00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.300
<v Speaker 5>it's constantly,</v>

1695
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.680
<v Speaker 5>there's constantly new stuff.</v>

1696
00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:49.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

1697
00:47:49.511 --> 00:47:50.290
<v Speaker 5>I just don't.</v>

1698
00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:51.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't think about it that much.</v>

1699
00:47:51.371 --> 00:47:54.340
<v Speaker 5>I know that I like playing games and everyone else can argue.</v>

1700
00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:54.731
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1701
00:47:54.731 --> 00:47:57.610
<v Speaker 5>I used to play as a chick in when I played quake.</v>

1702
00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.410
<v Speaker 5>I played when I played quick,</v>

1703
00:47:59.411 --> 00:48:00.430
<v Speaker 5>I always played as the church.</v>

1704
00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:01.120
<v Speaker 5>You know why?</v>

1705
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:01.650
<v Speaker 5>Because it's,</v>

1706
00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:03.070
<v Speaker 5>it's fun when she jumps,</v>

1707
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:04.041
<v Speaker 5>when she jumps,</v>

1708
00:48:04.041 --> 00:48:04.874
<v Speaker 5>she goes,</v>

1709
00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:09.520
<v Speaker 5>she would make that noise when she jumps and she was a smaller target.</v>

1710
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.400
<v Speaker 5>That's why we play as a chick because in quake three,</v>

1711
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:14.830
<v Speaker 5>like you could be that big fucking robot,</v>

1712
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.750
<v Speaker 5>but if you were there big fucking robot,</v>

1713
00:48:16.751 --> 00:48:18.220
<v Speaker 5>everybody could see really good.</v>

1714
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:18.620
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>

1715
00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:20.260
<v Speaker 5>that little tiny chick this jumping around,</v>

1716
00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:22.090
<v Speaker 5>it's a better character to play with.</v>

1717
00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:25.630
<v Speaker 5>I was just talking to Jamie about this the other day because I only play as girl</v>

1718
00:48:25.631 --> 00:48:26.860
<v Speaker 5>characters in video games.</v>

1719
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:27.783
<v Speaker 5>Always have.</v>

1720
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:28.220
<v Speaker 5>Well yeah,</v>

1721
00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:28.680
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1722
00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1723
00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:29.741
<v Speaker 5>but if I go,</v>

1724
00:48:29.741 --> 00:48:30.100
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1725
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 5>Jamie was paying as it plays as a guy and I play played that girl.</v>

1726
00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:33.850
<v Speaker 5>But like Jamie,</v>

1727
00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:34.460
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1728
00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:36.370
<v Speaker 5>I asked him why do you play as a,</v>

1729
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.031
<v Speaker 5>a guy?</v>

1730
00:48:37.031 --> 00:48:41.010
<v Speaker 5>I mean like if you had to sit there and watch a guy walk around for three hours,</v>

1731
00:48:41.011 --> 00:48:41.681
<v Speaker 5>like just as,</v>

1732
00:48:41.681 --> 00:48:45.490
<v Speaker 5>but for three hours that would be gay as fuck if you just sat there and watched</v>

1733
00:48:45.491 --> 00:48:46.050
<v Speaker 5>a guy.</v>

1734
00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:48.070
<v Speaker 5>But if you watch the girls but the third person.</v>

1735
00:48:48.071 --> 00:48:48.790
<v Speaker 5>So looking at.</v>

1736
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:49.111
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1737
00:48:49.111 --> 00:48:49.570
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1738
00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:51.490
<v Speaker 5>I always played in first person but yeah,</v>

1739
00:48:51.491 --> 00:48:52.320
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

1740
00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:52.710
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1741
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:53.040
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1742
00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.150
<v Speaker 5>What is everyone like video game gay.</v>

1743
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:59.140
<v Speaker 5>Jamie doesn't want anybody think he's gay and he wants to go way out of the way</v>

1744
00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.073
<v Speaker 5>so</v>

1745
00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:05.380
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't want anybody thinking that he secretly wants to be a woman.</v>

1746
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:08.510
<v Speaker 5>It's cute though because when we play together it's like we're on a date because</v>

1747
00:49:08.511 --> 00:49:09.010
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

1748
00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:14.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm like this hot chick and he's with this guy and should see his character.</v>

1749
00:49:14.861 --> 00:49:15.341
<v Speaker 5>It's all like,</v>

1750
00:49:15.341 --> 00:49:15.591
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1751
00:49:15.591 --> 00:49:16.391
<v Speaker 5>I'm cool.</v>

1752
00:49:16.391 --> 00:49:17.224
<v Speaker 5>Look at engineering.</v>

1753
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.741
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1754
00:49:17.741 --> 00:49:18.574
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1755
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:23.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to play any game like this fucking murder violence game,</v>

1756
00:49:23.411 --> 00:49:24.011
<v Speaker 5>whatever it's called.</v>

1757
00:49:24.011 --> 00:49:24.550
<v Speaker 5>What is it called?</v>

1758
00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:24.970
<v Speaker 5>Hatred,</v>

1759
00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:25.420
<v Speaker 5>hatred.</v>

1760
00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:26.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to play this game,</v>

1761
00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:28.510
<v Speaker 5>but if you want to make that game,</v>

1762
00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:29.950
<v Speaker 5>I can't stop you from making that game.</v>

1763
00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:30.521
<v Speaker 5>Just like,</v>

1764
00:49:30.521 --> 00:49:33.490
<v Speaker 5>I can't stop you from listening to fucking speed metal.</v>

1765
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:34.440
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1766
00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:37.810
<v Speaker 5>just like I can't stop you from watching violent,</v>

1767
00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.920
<v Speaker 5>gory movies.</v>

1768
00:49:38.921 --> 00:49:39.161
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1769
00:49:39.161 --> 00:49:40.180
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of violent,</v>

1770
00:49:40.181 --> 00:49:41.830
<v Speaker 5>gory moves I don't have nothing to do with.</v>

1771
00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:44.030
<v Speaker 5>But who's to say who the fuck?</v>

1772
00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.520
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of like functional,</v>

1773
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:46.360
<v Speaker 5>normal,</v>

1774
00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.480
<v Speaker 5>rational people that like to watch fucked up shit.</v>

1775
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:49.861
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1776
00:49:49.861 --> 00:49:50.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1777
00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:53.470
<v Speaker 5>but the thing that thing a lot of people need to get around is whether something</v>

1778
00:49:53.471 --> 00:49:54.440
<v Speaker 5>is being censored in the,</v>

1779
00:49:54.441 --> 00:49:59.050
<v Speaker 5>in the sense of like the government and the censored in the sense of a private</v>

1780
00:49:59.051 --> 00:49:59.830
<v Speaker 5>company.</v>

1781
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:04.450
<v Speaker 5>One of the big things gta five was was pulled off of shelves and target,</v>

1782
00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:05.560
<v Speaker 5>I think in Australia.</v>

1783
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:09.400
<v Speaker 5>There was another place in Australia that pulled it and a lot of it was because</v>

1784
00:50:09.401 --> 00:50:13.390
<v Speaker 5>of the treatment of people saying that the treatment of women in that game was</v>

1785
00:50:13.391 --> 00:50:13.810
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>

1786
00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:14.051
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1787
00:50:14.051 --> 00:50:15.370
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of holes in that game.</v>

1788
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:16.390
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1789
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:17.650
<v Speaker 5>You could run them over and shit.</v>

1790
00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:18.553
<v Speaker 5>Smacking Gum.</v>

1791
00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:19.571
<v Speaker 5>You could fuck them.</v>

1792
00:50:19.571 --> 00:50:20.560
<v Speaker 5>You go to a strip club.</v>

1793
00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:21.910
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

1794
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:22.420
<v Speaker 5>You can.</v>

1795
00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.690
<v Speaker 5>Well you can fucking your car and so you go to the Strip club and you can pick</v>

1796
00:50:25.691 --> 00:50:26.730
<v Speaker 5>up a girl and give her money.</v>

1797
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:27.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1798
00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 5>you can get hookers</v>

1799
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.130
<v Speaker 4>and then they start calling you and then you can meet for dates and then I</v>

1800
00:50:31.131 --> 00:50:34.670
<v Speaker 4>wonder if it would go away if they just made a like a dude strip club,</v>

1801
00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.410
<v Speaker 4>like an guy prostitutes,</v>

1802
00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:38.750
<v Speaker 4>if any would be there.</v>

1803
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:40.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

1804
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:42.380
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

1805
00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:43.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1806
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:44.680
<v Speaker 3>how dare you.</v>

1807
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.270
<v Speaker 3>It's so unfair.</v>

1808
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:46.971
<v Speaker 4>They did not.</v>

1809
00:50:46.971 --> 00:50:47.511
<v Speaker 4>If they did that,</v>

1810
00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:48.980
<v Speaker 4>I'd be the first person to jump in,</v>

1811
00:50:48.981 --> 00:50:51.050
<v Speaker 4>game recorded on youtube and be like,</v>

1812
00:50:51.051 --> 00:50:51.550
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1813
00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:53.120
<v Speaker 4>it's the first dude onto blow job.</v>

1814
00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.193
<v Speaker 3>If I.</v>

1815
00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:54.791
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1816
00:50:54.791 --> 00:50:57.470
<v Speaker 3>I think that once I've been talking about this onstage,</v>

1817
00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:02.040
<v Speaker 3>I think that once they develop artificial men like artificial human beings,</v>

1818
00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:03.100
<v Speaker 3>like blade runner style,</v>

1819
00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:03.993
<v Speaker 3>it's going to come.</v>

1820
00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:07.620
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be women that have sex robots in their house and we're gonna.</v>

1821
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.880
<v Speaker 3>Find out what women really like when,</v>

1822
00:51:09.881 --> 00:51:14.881
<v Speaker 3>when when you can actually buy a person that is an artificial person that was</v>

1823
00:51:17.261 --> 00:51:22.240
<v Speaker 3>created entirely in a lab and you could manufacture their personality and get it</v>

1824
00:51:22.241 --> 00:51:26.860
<v Speaker 3>to exactly where you want it to be and have them do anything you want them to</v>

1825
00:51:26.861 --> 00:51:27.071
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1826
00:51:27.071 --> 00:51:28.840
<v Speaker 3>They're essentially robot sex slaves.</v>

1827
00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.470
<v Speaker 3>You're going to go over your grandma's house and she's going to have five,</v>

1828
00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:36.160
<v Speaker 3>seven foot tall Zulu warriors had just throw declutter all day.</v>

1829
00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:38.410
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be the reality.</v>

1830
00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:39.551
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's going to be.</v>

1831
00:51:39.551 --> 00:51:42.610
<v Speaker 3>You're going to go over your mom's house and everyone is going to look like</v>

1832
00:51:42.611 --> 00:51:45.850
<v Speaker 3>Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime and they're all going to be walking around</v>

1833
00:51:45.851 --> 00:51:49.180
<v Speaker 3>with Whitey tighties on a giant hogs at black arnold.</v>

1834
00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:49.960
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

1835
00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.430
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she likes them all mixed up.</v>

1836
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she likes Arnold Arnold.</v>

1837
00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:54.401
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1838
00:51:54.401 --> 00:51:57.100
<v Speaker 3>they'll going to be able to recreate celebrities.</v>

1839
00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean Jennifer Lawrence is not just going to be on the cloud.</v>

1840
00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:03.910
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have her in your fucking dungeon going to have her locked up.</v>

1841
00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:05.740
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be real.</v>

1842
00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:06.161
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1843
00:52:06.161 --> 00:52:07.630
<v Speaker 3>it's not that difficult to do.</v>

1844
00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:10.540
<v Speaker 3>If they can make a three d representation of her right now,</v>

1845
00:52:10.541 --> 00:52:11.710
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty accurate.</v>

1846
00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:16.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean the the graphics that they can do right now in video games are fucking</v>

1847
00:52:16.001 --> 00:52:21.001
<v Speaker 3>incredible and the CGI that can do is incredible and then you've seen that robot</v>

1848
00:52:21.731 --> 00:52:25.450
<v Speaker 3>Japanese face where it's getting pretty creepy.</v>

1849
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.040
<v Speaker 3>It's getting pretty creepy.</v>

1850
00:52:27.041 --> 00:52:29.170
<v Speaker 3>They're getting really close to human beings.</v>

1851
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:32.350
<v Speaker 3>They haven't bridged even at videos with.</v>

1852
00:52:32.351 --> 00:52:32.970
<v Speaker 3>What does that,</v>

1853
00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:33.360
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1854
00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.930
<v Speaker 3>that valley,</v>

1855
00:52:34.931 --> 00:52:35.680
<v Speaker 3>they call it,</v>

1856
00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.860
<v Speaker 3>they call it the Erie Valley or I forget the term that they use.</v>

1857
00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.860
<v Speaker 3>That is the difference between look like me,</v>

1858
00:52:41.861 --> 00:52:42.820
<v Speaker 3>you looking at you,</v>

1859
00:52:42.821 --> 00:52:43.601
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at you.</v>

1860
00:52:43.601 --> 00:52:48.340
<v Speaker 3>I know you're really there and there's just weirdness when you're looking at an</v>

1861
00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:51.160
<v Speaker 3>excellent representation of a CGI human.</v>

1862
00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:53.150
<v Speaker 3>Like we went to the Nvidia m,</v>

1863
00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:58.340
<v Speaker 3>a headquarters in northern California when I was doing the Scifi show and we saw</v>

1864
00:52:58.781 --> 00:52:59.471
<v Speaker 3>the latest,</v>

1865
00:52:59.471 --> 00:53:03.550
<v Speaker 3>greatest high tech version of human beings that they've created and it's</v>

1866
00:53:03.551 --> 00:53:04.660
<v Speaker 3>incredible.</v>

1867
00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:05.770
<v Speaker 3>It's so good.</v>

1868
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.600
<v Speaker 3>But there's still some shit.</v>

1869
00:53:07.601 --> 00:53:09.100
<v Speaker 3>They can't do like tongues.</v>

1870
00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:10.413
<v Speaker 3>They can't,</v>

1871
00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:12.270
<v Speaker 3>they can't like do like,</v>

1872
00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:16.380
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like a real tongue and it doesn't look like real eyelashes and</v>

1873
00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.950
<v Speaker 3>the eyeballs were a little off.</v>

1874
00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:20.830
<v Speaker 4>I think in the future that we're going to be growing all our parts as soon as</v>

1875
00:53:20.831 --> 00:53:21.790
<v Speaker 4>we're allowed to do that,</v>

1876
00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:24.760
<v Speaker 4>we're going to be growing fake tongues.</v>

1877
00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:25.111
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1878
00:53:25.111 --> 00:53:25.341
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1879
00:53:25.341 --> 00:53:25.521
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1880
00:53:25.521 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 4>and that's</v>

1881
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.160
<v Speaker 1>what's going to change where it's actually real skin,</v>

1882
00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.810
<v Speaker 1>but inside it's a robot,</v>

1883
00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:31.950
<v Speaker 1>but it feels real.</v>

1884
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Sex feels real for sure.</v>

1885
00:53:34.351 --> 00:53:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean the robots are going to be made out of some sort of artificial skin that</v>

1886
00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.770
<v Speaker 1>is indistinguishable from regular skin.</v>

1887
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.460
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be heated to the same temperature as a regular person's body.</v>

1888
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean the insides will probably be just artificial organs and some sort of a</v>

1889
00:53:49.231 --> 00:53:50.310
<v Speaker 1>weird construction.</v>

1890
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:52.140
<v Speaker 1>And then that's gonna Happen Man.</v>

1891
00:53:52.141 --> 00:53:53.100
<v Speaker 1>And when that happens,</v>

1892
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:56.170
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find out what people actually like because I think a lot of what</v>

1893
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:57.270
<v Speaker 1>people complained about,</v>

1894
00:53:57.271 --> 00:54:00.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like people feel they feel disempowered.</v>

1895
00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:00.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1896
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:04.170
<v Speaker 1>like women who don't look anything like Laura Croft,</v>

1897
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:06.570
<v Speaker 1>like sexism in video games,</v>

1898
00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:07.740
<v Speaker 1>the patriarchy.</v>

1899
00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:10.470
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible for male female relationships,</v>

1900
00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:13.910
<v Speaker 1>chauvinist men who exists on white privilege and.</v>

1901
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:16.230
<v Speaker 1>But if you could have seven,</v>

1902
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:19.860
<v Speaker 1>seven foot Tall Zulu warriors throw a dick at you all day,</v>

1903
00:54:19.861 --> 00:54:20.371
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>

1904
00:54:20.371 --> 00:54:21.210
<v Speaker 1>you'd lie on bitch.</v>

1905
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:23.100
<v Speaker 1>You would lock yourself up in your house.</v>

1906
00:54:23.101 --> 00:54:27.030
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't tell word you didn't walk out of your house all frumpy and fucked</v>

1907
00:54:27.031 --> 00:54:27.320
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1908
00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Just Been Dick defied all day confused.</v>

1909
00:54:30.691 --> 00:54:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Your hair's going to be in a bundle and you would give up on all your feminism.</v>

1910
00:54:33.811 --> 00:54:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Engaging bullshit.</v>

1911
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Unless that was how you made a living.</v>

1912
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.033
<v Speaker 1>It would be interesting.</v>

1913
00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:40.500
<v Speaker 1>It would be interesting to see what your friends,</v>

1914
00:54:40.501 --> 00:54:40.711
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1915
00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:43.620
<v Speaker 1>what their version of what their perfect girl would be.</v>

1916
00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:46.140
<v Speaker 1>It'd be interesting to see if like if everybody was Asian,</v>

1917
00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:51.170
<v Speaker 1>you know Amanda would change for men with the reality of men is we have DNA that</v>

1918
00:54:52.921 --> 00:54:57.921
<v Speaker 1>is designed to want to have sex with as many people as possible because that is</v>

1919
00:54:57.961 --> 00:55:01.260
<v Speaker 1>the reason why the human race made it 2014.</v>

1920
00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:06.150
<v Speaker 1>The human race didn't make it a 2014 because men were eager for monogamy and</v>

1921
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:07.500
<v Speaker 1>once they're woman died,</v>

1922
00:55:07.501 --> 00:55:11.040
<v Speaker 1>they could never love another like in these fucking goofy ass movies and books.</v>

1923
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.461
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1924
00:55:11.461 --> 00:55:13.590
<v Speaker 1>The reality is men want to fuck everything.</v>

1925
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:13.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1926
00:55:13.981 --> 00:55:14.814
<v Speaker 1>we just can't.</v>

1927
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:15.930
<v Speaker 1>And why?</v>

1928
00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we can't because we either aren't attractive enough or we can't</v>

1929
00:55:20.821 --> 00:55:24.210
<v Speaker 1>because we have a girlfriend and she doesn't want us to or we can't because we</v>

1930
00:55:24.211 --> 00:55:25.044
<v Speaker 1>have a family.</v>

1931
00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Whatever,</v>

1932
00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:26.430
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

1933
00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:30.390
<v Speaker 1>you want to stick your Dick in a lot of different things and the reason being is</v>

1934
00:55:30.391 --> 00:55:31.440
<v Speaker 1>because you read Dna.</v>

1935
00:55:31.441 --> 00:55:31.711
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1936
00:55:31.711 --> 00:55:36.711
<v Speaker 1>it's like super simple society and our culture and our feelings for other people</v>

1937
00:55:37.741 --> 00:55:39.480
<v Speaker 1>or the only thing that keeps us from doing that.</v>

1938
00:55:39.481 --> 00:55:42.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's anyone that's against sex robots.</v>

1939
00:55:42.301 --> 00:55:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I think that if the stuff that you're talking about,</v>

1940
00:55:44.791 --> 00:55:46.470
<v Speaker 1>like I'm sure many wives would be like,</v>

1941
00:55:46.471 --> 00:55:46.771
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1942
00:55:46.771 --> 00:55:46.960
<v Speaker 1>give.</v>

1943
00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:47.670
<v Speaker 1>My husband said,</v>

1944
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:48.361
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

1945
00:55:48.361 --> 00:55:49.830
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking bull shit.</v>

1946
00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.180
<v Speaker 1>She'll power.</v>

1947
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.360
<v Speaker 1>That dude will get divorced leg a lot.</v>

1948
00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1949
00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:55.410
<v Speaker 1>he will do whatever he wants.</v>

1950
00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.100
<v Speaker 1>He will be going golfing whenever he wants.</v>

1951
00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:01.290
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to listen to anybody anymore.</v>

1952
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:05.370
<v Speaker 1>If you have some traci lords in her prime sex robot at your house,</v>

1953
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.300
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

1954
00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Your wife can't tell you shit that bitch better.</v>

1955
00:56:09.271 --> 00:56:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>

1956
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.090
<v Speaker 1>You're lucky if you feed her.</v>

1957
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:13.350
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1958
00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:16.770
<v Speaker 1>she's lucky if you let her stay in the house like you need to sleep where the</v>

1959
00:56:16.771 --> 00:56:17.604
<v Speaker 1>dog sleeps.</v>

1960
00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:19.260
<v Speaker 1>You can't sleep in my house anymore.</v>

1961
00:56:19.261 --> 00:56:22.680
<v Speaker 1>You've been telling me what to do for 20 years and women the same thing you</v>

1962
00:56:22.681 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 1>think are going to deal with their</v>

1963
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.150
<v Speaker 3>fucking beer.</v>

1964
00:56:25.151 --> 00:56:28.030
<v Speaker 3>Bellied stupid husband and it's Stinky Dick.</v>

1965
00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.250
<v Speaker 3>You know they're not going to.</v>

1966
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.121
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be like,</v>

1967
00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:31.721
<v Speaker 3>look Harry,</v>

1968
00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:32.554
<v Speaker 3>it's over.</v>

1969
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.240
<v Speaker 3>You know I got arnold,</v>

1970
00:56:34.241 --> 00:56:34.541
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

1971
00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:35.830
<v Speaker 3>two and three behind me.</v>

1972
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:41.170
<v Speaker 3>Three fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger's with giant hogs in their underwear is</v>

1973
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.860
<v Speaker 3>going to be,</v>

1974
00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:42.693
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1975
00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:43.890
<v Speaker 3>we're going to,</v>

1976
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:44.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1977
00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:46.150
<v Speaker 3>everybody's worried about population control.</v>

1978
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:51.220
<v Speaker 3>The real problem is going to be not enough people having babies because no one</v>

1979
00:56:51.221 --> 00:56:54.190
<v Speaker 3>wants to have anything to do with biological people because everybody's just</v>

1980
00:56:54.191 --> 00:56:56.680
<v Speaker 3>fucking these absolutely perfect sex robots.</v>

1981
00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:57.130
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1982
00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:57.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1983
00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:58.133
<v Speaker 4>I'm all for it.</v>

1984
00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.000
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1985
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.190
<v Speaker 4>I think once we got past all the weird sex shit that we keep inside,</v>

1986
00:57:03.191 --> 00:57:03.371
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1987
00:57:03.371 --> 00:57:05.740
<v Speaker 4>Because then you don't have to have another person judging you.</v>

1988
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:06.251
<v Speaker 4>We can,</v>

1989
00:57:06.251 --> 00:57:07.960
<v Speaker 4>we can hate each other for good reasons.</v>

1990
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:13.190
<v Speaker 3>I honestly think as much as I really truly enjoy sex and I enjoy pleasure and I</v>

1991
00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:17.700
<v Speaker 3>think affection is like one of the best things in life.</v>

1992
00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:19.230
<v Speaker 3>Not just like sex,</v>

1993
00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:20.490
<v Speaker 3>but just hugging people.</v>

1994
00:57:20.491 --> 00:57:20.701
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1995
00:57:20.701 --> 00:57:20.801
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1996
00:57:20.801 --> 00:57:21.634
<v Speaker 3>it's beautiful.</v>

1997
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:22.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1998
00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:24.270
<v Speaker 3>there's something really awesome about affection,</v>

1999
00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:29.960
<v Speaker 3>but I think one of the things that's holding back human beings and one of the</v>

2000
00:57:30.091 --> 00:57:34.470
<v Speaker 3>things that keeps us in this sort of animalistic state is this competitive</v>

2001
00:57:34.471 --> 00:57:36.030
<v Speaker 3>desire to be attractive,</v>

2002
00:57:36.031 --> 00:57:37.880
<v Speaker 3>to find attractive people to,</v>

2003
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:38.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2004
00:57:38.661 --> 00:57:42.990
<v Speaker 3>to be sexually attractive and to mate with sexually attractive people.</v>

2005
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:48.120
<v Speaker 3>This is all like weird sort of confusing shit that kind of keeps us from being</v>

2006
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:52.320
<v Speaker 3>the next level of enlightenment and reaching the next level of enlightenment.</v>

2007
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:54.000
<v Speaker 3>And when you look at aliens,</v>

2008
00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:55.650
<v Speaker 3>you know the archetype,</v>

2009
00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Gray Alien,</v>

2010
00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:58.950
<v Speaker 3>they have gi Joe,</v>

2011
00:57:58.951 --> 00:57:59.910
<v Speaker 3>Dick's like,</v>

2012
00:57:59.911 --> 00:58:00.870
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing there,</v>

2013
00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:01.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2014
00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:02.580
<v Speaker 3>They're totally smooth.</v>

2015
00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:03.810
<v Speaker 3>They have no muscle,</v>

2016
00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:04.651
<v Speaker 3>they have no.</v>

2017
00:58:04.651 --> 00:58:06.690
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing sexually attractive about an alien.</v>

2018
00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:07.900
<v Speaker 3>They're just like these,</v>

2019
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:11.010
<v Speaker 3>these sort of like almost insectoid,</v>

2020
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2021
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.690
<v Speaker 3>smooth body,</v>

2022
00:58:12.691 --> 00:58:13.800
<v Speaker 3>smooth limb.</v>

2023
00:58:13.801 --> 00:58:18.801
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing curvaceous or sweaty or animalistic or there's nothing kinetic</v>

2024
00:58:20.461 --> 00:58:21.210
<v Speaker 3>about them.</v>

2025
00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:22.920
<v Speaker 3>They have these giant fucking heads,</v>

2026
00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:25.680
<v Speaker 3>this little slip for a mouse because he probably don't even use their mouths</v>

2027
00:58:25.681 --> 00:58:26.430
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2028
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:30.300
<v Speaker 3>They just communicate with their brains and they have super powered brains that</v>

2029
00:58:30.301 --> 00:58:32.550
<v Speaker 3>can move shit with their mind.</v>

2030
00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:36.630
<v Speaker 3>That's probably where the future is going to be.</v>

2031
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:41.870
<v Speaker 3>If they could figure out a way to recreate pleasure in a much more intense way</v>

2032
00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:47.040
<v Speaker 3>than you ever get from sex and just do it like with the mind if they could</v>

2033
00:58:47.041 --> 00:58:48.180
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way to do that.</v>

2034
00:58:48.181 --> 00:58:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Demolition man.</v>

2035
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.261
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2036
00:58:49.261 --> 00:58:50.240
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to need a.</v>

2037
00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:51.600
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to need to fuck people anymore.</v>

2038
00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:51.991
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2039
00:58:51.991 --> 00:58:52.610
<v Speaker 4>But I think like,</v>

2040
00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:54.360
<v Speaker 4>so when someone made that alien,</v>

2041
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2042
00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:55.411
<v Speaker 4>It's all smooth.</v>

2043
00:58:55.411 --> 00:58:56.820
<v Speaker 4>Everything in the future is minimalistic.</v>

2044
00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:59.010
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to be the guy that draws a dick on it?</v>

2045
00:58:59.260 --> 00:58:59.610
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2046
00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:01.560
<v Speaker 4>because you'll be that guy that was like,</v>

2047
00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.650
<v Speaker 3>it should have a dick though.</v>

2048
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:06.020
<v Speaker 3>It should have a dick and less.</v>

2049
00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:06.860
<v Speaker 3>Well that was.</v>

2050
00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:07.250
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2051
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:09.020
<v Speaker 3>if you go to the uh,</v>

2052
00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:09.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2053
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:11.720
<v Speaker 3>I had to study this for.</v>

2054
00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:12.530
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have to,</v>

2055
00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:16.340
<v Speaker 3>but I read about it a lot firsthand just for my own amusement.</v>

2056
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:18.200
<v Speaker 3>But then when I was doing this Scifi show,</v>

2057
00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 3>I had to really get into alien abduction and to figure out like what are the</v>

2058
00:59:22.011 --> 00:59:22.844
<v Speaker 3>common themes?</v>

2059
00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:26.870
<v Speaker 3>And the common theme is these people to get abducted.</v>

2060
00:59:26.871 --> 00:59:31.871
<v Speaker 3>They all say that the aliens need our genetic material because they only</v>

2061
00:59:32.601 --> 00:59:36.770
<v Speaker 3>reproduced through cloning now and they need fresh DNA.</v>

2062
00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:38.480
<v Speaker 3>That's what they say,</v>

2063
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:40.670
<v Speaker 3>but they also say,</v>

2064
00:59:40.671 --> 00:59:41.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2065
00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:41.320
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2066
00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:41.680
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2067
00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.780
<v Speaker 3>the real problem with all that stuff is this.</v>

2068
00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:45.860
<v Speaker 3>People that get abducted or all goofy,</v>

2069
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:47.180
<v Speaker 3>like almost all of them.</v>

2070
00:59:47.410 --> 00:59:49.450
<v Speaker 4>I think that I believe in aliens.</v>

2071
00:59:49.451 --> 00:59:51.670
<v Speaker 4>I just don't know if they're abducting us.</v>

2072
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.983
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2073
00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:53.973
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so,</v>

2074
00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:54.801
<v Speaker 4>but I definitely,</v>

2075
00:59:54.801 --> 00:59:56.350
<v Speaker 4>I think there has to be something else.</v>

2076
00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:57.011
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2077
00:59:57.011 --> 00:59:58.130
<v Speaker 3>there should be something out.</v>

2078
00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:58.400
<v Speaker 3>Will.</v>

2079
00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.870
<v Speaker 3>The idea of infinity.</v>

2080
01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:01.000
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

2081
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.810
<v Speaker 3>was explained to me by a physicist who said that the universe is so large that</v>

2082
01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:07.220
<v Speaker 3>if it is in fact infinite.</v>

2083
01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.150
<v Speaker 3>Not only is there a you somewhere in the universe,</v>

2084
01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:16.360
<v Speaker 3>but there is a you that has lived every second of your life exactly the way you</v>

2085
01:00:17.541 --> 01:00:22.541
<v Speaker 3>have with every other event on earth happening in the exact same order and an</v>

2086
01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:26.390
<v Speaker 3>infinite number of them.</v>

2087
01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:30.920
<v Speaker 3>So not just one Philip Defranco that has been on Youtube for eight years and has</v>

2088
01:00:30.921 --> 01:00:31.521
<v Speaker 3>3 million,</v>

2089
01:00:31.521 --> 01:00:33.320
<v Speaker 3>397,000 youtube,</v>

2090
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.150
<v Speaker 3>but an infinite number of them.</v>

2091
01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:38.000
<v Speaker 3>And every nod that you've done this,</v>

2092
01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:40.690
<v Speaker 3>Philip to Franco has done every smile like you just did.</v>

2093
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.370
<v Speaker 3>Every Philip to Franco in the universe has done that.</v>

2094
01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.520
<v Speaker 3>And all other possible variables.</v>

2095
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Blake Philip,</v>

2096
01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:48.030
<v Speaker 3>prank,</v>

2097
01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:52.010
<v Speaker 3>staying in law school up to Franco becoming a gay method.</v>

2098
01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Fill up every possible variable that you could have done in your life is being</v>

2099
01:00:58.251 --> 01:00:59.210
<v Speaker 3>done throughout the universe.</v>

2100
01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.920
<v Speaker 3>That's how big infinity is.</v>

2101
01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:01.281
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2102
01:01:01.281 --> 01:01:02.870
<v Speaker 4>I think when I have those conversations though,</v>

2103
01:01:02.871 --> 01:01:03.470
<v Speaker 4>I get.</v>

2104
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:04.303
<v Speaker 4>I get like,</v>

2105
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.310
<v Speaker 4>are you still freaking out about this concept?</v>

2106
01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:10.700
<v Speaker 4>It's a mind fuck Philip to Franco damn mind.</v>

2107
01:01:10.701 --> 01:01:11.000
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

2108
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:11.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2109
01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:11.710
<v Speaker 4>is it,</v>

2110
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:14.900
<v Speaker 4>is it all those small little infinite changes or like are you talking about</v>

2111
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.720
<v Speaker 4>dinosaurs on skateboards in infinity is a thing.</v>

2112
01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:18.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2113
01:01:18.561 --> 01:01:19.394
<v Speaker 3>it's possible.</v>

2114
01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:23.450
<v Speaker 3>The infinity is so big that there's truly no end to it.</v>

2115
01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:26.630
<v Speaker 3>Like it literally has no end.</v>

2116
01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:28.530
<v Speaker 3>There is no end to the universe.</v>

2117
01:01:28.531 --> 01:01:28.851
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2118
01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:30.140
<v Speaker 3>my small eight brain goes,</v>

2119
01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.373
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2120
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:32.343
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

2121
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:33.890
<v Speaker 3>It's beyond our capacity.</v>

2122
01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:37.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like taking an iphone six and wavering over an ant going,</v>

2123
01:01:37.551 --> 01:01:37.881
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2124
01:01:37.881 --> 01:01:41.060
<v Speaker 3>I got the new shit and doesn't know what the fuck you talking about.</v>

2125
01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.111
<v Speaker 3>It can't.</v>

2126
01:01:42.111 --> 01:01:44.480
<v Speaker 3>You can't look 16 megapixel camera,</v>

2127
01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.770
<v Speaker 3>128 gigs.</v>

2128
01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.650
<v Speaker 3>The aunt has zero capacity for,</v>

2129
01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:53.210
<v Speaker 3>for absorbing that information and I think when you get to something that is as</v>

2130
01:01:53.211 --> 01:01:55.130
<v Speaker 3>big as the concept of infinity,</v>

2131
01:01:55.430 --> 01:02:00.430
<v Speaker 3>but we're better at understanding the concept of infinity than a chimp or then</v>

2132
01:02:00.711 --> 01:02:02.330
<v Speaker 3>our ancient ancestors,</v>

2133
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2134
01:02:02.901 --> 01:02:03.501
<v Speaker 3>then uh,</v>

2135
01:02:03.501 --> 01:02:04.360
<v Speaker 3>Australia pithy,</v>

2136
01:02:04.361 --> 01:02:04.700
<v Speaker 3>gus,</v>

2137
01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:05.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2138
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:05.171
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2139
01:02:05.171 --> 01:02:05.810
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2140
01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:06.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2141
01:02:06.130 --> 01:02:07.340
<v Speaker 3>ancient hominid.</v>

2142
01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:12.700
<v Speaker 3>So I think that as our technology grows and as our understanding of the universe</v>

2143
01:02:14.361 --> 01:02:15.194
<v Speaker 3>grows,</v>

2144
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:20.230
<v Speaker 3>most likely slowly but surely our capacity to understand that will grow as well.</v>

2145
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:23.010
<v Speaker 3>But certain things like infinity,</v>

2146
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:24.750
<v Speaker 3>it's so far away.</v>

2147
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:25.201
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

2148
01:02:25.201 --> 01:02:28.320
<v Speaker 3>it's so far away like intellectually for us to wrap our head around.</v>

2149
01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:29.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we really can.</v>

2150
01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:30.001
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2151
01:02:30.001 --> 01:02:30.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2152
01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:31.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2153
01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:35.010
<v Speaker 4>I just remember in college just waking up in the middle of the night terrified</v>

2154
01:02:35.011 --> 01:02:35.840
<v Speaker 4>of those thoughts.</v>

2155
01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.070
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2156
01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:36.511
<v Speaker 4>Because it's just,</v>

2157
01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:37.380
<v Speaker 4>it's too big.</v>

2158
01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:38.131
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2159
01:02:38.131 --> 01:02:38.820
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2160
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:39.690
<v Speaker 4>it's terrifying.</v>

2161
01:02:39.691 --> 01:02:39.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2162
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:43.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm okay with not mattering in the grand scheme of things,</v>

2163
01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.350
<v Speaker 4>but just to think that it's just so big.</v>

2164
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:48.570
<v Speaker 3>Well then there's the fractal notion of the universe,</v>

2165
01:02:48.571 --> 01:02:50.020
<v Speaker 3>which is even more fucked up,</v>

2166
01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.480
<v Speaker 3>which is as big as the universe is,</v>

2167
01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:57.840
<v Speaker 3>that it really is just one atom that is in a person that exists in another</v>

2168
01:02:58.661 --> 01:03:03.310
<v Speaker 3>universe that is also infinite or it's all part of like a computer program that</v>

2169
01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.153
<v Speaker 3>always movies.</v>

2170
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:06.640
<v Speaker 3>There was like four of them that came out in two years.</v>

2171
01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:07.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2172
01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:09.360
<v Speaker 3>Well that's not just a movie man.</v>

2173
01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:10.150
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

2174
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:11.020
<v Speaker 3>There's this guy,</v>

2175
01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.020
<v Speaker 3>a gates.</v>

2176
01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:12.611
<v Speaker 3>What is his name?</v>

2177
01:03:12.611 --> 01:03:13.450
<v Speaker 3>James Gates.</v>

2178
01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:14.291
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2179
01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:14.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2180
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:16.210
<v Speaker 3>he's an astrophysicist.</v>

2181
01:03:16.211 --> 01:03:17.740
<v Speaker 3>Or is he a quantum physicist?</v>

2182
01:03:17.741 --> 01:03:18.291
<v Speaker 3>One of those guys,</v>

2183
01:03:18.291 --> 01:03:18.940
<v Speaker 3>string theorists.</v>

2184
01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:19.773
<v Speaker 3>Three years.</v>

2185
01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:25.060
<v Speaker 3>He has done all these computations on string theory and he's found this</v>

2186
01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:31.350
<v Speaker 3>underlying computer code self-correcting computer code in all of the equations</v>

2187
01:03:33.471 --> 01:03:34.304
<v Speaker 3>to string theory.</v>

2188
01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:37.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand what the fuck this guy saying he's going,</v>

2189
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:39.550
<v Speaker 3>he's coming on the podcast we're going to have.</v>

2190
01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:40.450
<v Speaker 3>We're flying them in.</v>

2191
01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:41.020
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2192
01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:41.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2193
01:03:41.321 --> 01:03:42.154
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2194
01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:43.740
<v Speaker 3>You're staying home for that one.</v>

2195
01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:44.853
<v Speaker 3>No fucking way.</v>

2196
01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:45.923
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

2197
01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:47.043
<v Speaker 3>Why is it staying home?</v>

2198
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:48.043
<v Speaker 3>He'll fuck that up.</v>

2199
01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:51.130
<v Speaker 3>They'll start talking about poop or something like that and I'll get confused.</v>

2200
01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:52.360
<v Speaker 3>It gets distracting,</v>

2201
01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:58.260
<v Speaker 3>but this guy has come up with these theories that are based on his self</v>

2202
01:03:59.421 --> 01:04:03.970
<v Speaker 3>correcting computer code that was discovered by human beings like the 19</v>

2203
01:04:03.971 --> 01:04:04.804
<v Speaker 3>thirties,</v>

2204
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:05.760
<v Speaker 3>the this,</v>

2205
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.450
<v Speaker 3>this self correcting code.</v>

2206
01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:12.330
<v Speaker 3>He's isolated this and identified this in all of these,</v>

2207
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.950
<v Speaker 3>these string theory computations,</v>

2208
01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:18.940
<v Speaker 3>so what he believes is that in some way,</v>

2209
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
<v Speaker 3>this may be proof that we are in some sort of a computer simulation and that one</v>

2210
01:04:25.241 --> 01:04:26.890
<v Speaker 3>day without a doubt,</v>

2211
01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:29.350
<v Speaker 3>we will have the capacity if we don't blow ourselves up,</v>

2212
01:04:29.351 --> 01:04:30.700
<v Speaker 3>if we don't get hit by an asteroid,</v>

2213
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Dyna,</v>

2214
01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:32.140
<v Speaker 3>super volcano,</v>

2215
01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:36.190
<v Speaker 3>whatever we will have the capacity of technology continues to expand.</v>

2216
01:04:36.191 --> 01:04:41.191
<v Speaker 3>An exponential rate will have the capacity to create some sort of an artificial</v>

2217
01:04:41.261 --> 01:04:46.210
<v Speaker 3>reality that is indistinguishable from this reality and if that's the case,</v>

2218
01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:48.640
<v Speaker 3>how do we know that we're not already in it?</v>

2219
01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:53.970
<v Speaker 3>It is quite possible that we are already in it and that's not just stoner dummy</v>

2220
01:04:55.001 --> 01:04:56.830
<v Speaker 3>fear factor host talk.</v>

2221
01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:57.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2222
01:04:57.790 --> 01:04:59.920
<v Speaker 3>this is actually like physicists,</v>

2223
01:04:59.921 --> 01:05:04.540
<v Speaker 3>this is actually like people who are studying this stuff from an objective</v>

2224
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:06.310
<v Speaker 3>educated perspective</v>

2225
01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:07.920
<v Speaker 4>and it's cool,</v>

2226
01:05:07.921 --> 01:05:10.910
<v Speaker 4>but when other than finding out if it,</v>

2227
01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:11.880
<v Speaker 4>if it is a real thing,</v>

2228
01:05:11.881 --> 01:05:12.620
<v Speaker 4>do you think the.</v>

2229
01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:13.680
<v Speaker 4>Does it change anything?</v>

2230
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:14.993
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2231
01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:15.870
<v Speaker 4>In what way?</v>

2232
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 4>Do you could just fucking go out and</v>

2233
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.990
<v Speaker 1>go balls out out right now?</v>

2234
01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2235
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:21.023
<v Speaker 1>but he go to jail.</v>

2236
01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I know you're going to find the code and then you're gonna be able to change it</v>

2237
01:05:25.541 --> 01:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>so you don't go to jail.</v>

2238
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:26.591
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2239
01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can do that.</v>

2240
01:05:27.581 --> 01:05:29.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think there's been like any game,</v>

2241
01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>if you're playing a game,</v>

2242
01:05:31.091 --> 01:05:32.320
<v Speaker 1>there's rules to that game.</v>

2243
01:05:32.321 --> 01:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2244
01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2245
01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:33.840
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

2246
01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.110
<v Speaker 1>if you do something,</v>

2247
01:05:35.111 --> 01:05:36.970
<v Speaker 1>it takes away your health and power,</v>

2248
01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2249
01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what happens is you get on heroin in this game.</v>

2250
01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's certain,</v>

2251
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:46.750
<v Speaker 1>there's certain things that people do in this world where if you think about it,</v>

2252
01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:49.740
<v Speaker 1>if you were a completely objective and you're standing on the outside and you</v>

2253
01:05:49.741 --> 01:05:50.021
<v Speaker 1>were going,</v>

2254
01:05:50.021 --> 01:05:50.091
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2255
01:05:50.091 --> 01:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>what is going on there?</v>

2256
01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:50.951
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2257
01:05:50.951 --> 01:05:52.690
<v Speaker 1>they're playing a game and they have,</v>

2258
01:05:52.691 --> 01:05:52.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2259
01:05:52.961 --> 01:05:55.410
<v Speaker 1>x amount of years in this game and you know,</v>

2260
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:59.170
<v Speaker 1>you have cells and everybody's given a different character and everybody has a</v>

2261
01:05:59.171 --> 01:06:01.990
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of points you're trying to achieve.</v>

2262
01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I had this friend that,</v>

2263
01:06:04.001 --> 01:06:04.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2264
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:05.470
<v Speaker 1>used to manage the comedy store.</v>

2265
01:06:05.471 --> 01:06:07.030
<v Speaker 1>You remember rob from the comedy store.</v>

2266
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Brian Guy that works in Phoenix now.</v>

2267
01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:10.810
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2268
01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Rob Was the guy that was addicted to everquest</v>

2269
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:20.230
<v Speaker 1>and he was completely addicted to everquest and this poor bastard would come to</v>

2270
01:06:20.231 --> 01:06:22.300
<v Speaker 1>the comedy store and he was Pale.</v>

2271
01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:23.800
<v Speaker 1>He would like be Ashen,</v>

2272
01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.890
<v Speaker 1>like he looks sick at all.</v>

2273
01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.790
<v Speaker 1>He was doing for like 12,</v>

2274
01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:28.220
<v Speaker 1>13,</v>

2275
01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:29.110
<v Speaker 1>14 hours a day,</v>

2276
01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.120
<v Speaker 1>was sitting in front of his computer and playing everquest.</v>

2277
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:32.490
<v Speaker 1>And he said like,</v>

2278
01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:37.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm so good at making money in everquest but so bad at doing it in real life.</v>

2279
01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking like,</v>

2280
01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:42.490
<v Speaker 1>you're playing the wrong game,</v>

2281
01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:44.020
<v Speaker 1>like you're in this game,</v>

2282
01:06:44.021 --> 01:06:44.854
<v Speaker 1>but this game is,</v>

2283
01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.210
<v Speaker 1>you've got to play this game.</v>

2284
01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:47.620
<v Speaker 1>The way you're playing that game.</v>

2285
01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Like if you went around this game life,</v>

2328
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:44.710
<v Speaker 1>My wife just tells me not to be retarded.</v>

2329
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2330
01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:46.960
<v Speaker 1>too late bitch.</v>

2331
01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:48.460
<v Speaker 1>I wish that was a word that was.</v>

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not a medical term.</v>

2337
01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:55.151
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2338
01:07:55.151 --> 01:07:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Retarded means to retard to be slower.</v>

2339
01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Some people are retarded.</v>

2340
01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:03.940
<v Speaker 1>They are slower in catching on to other folks.</v>

2341
01:08:03.941 --> 01:08:07.390
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you're mocking a disease and I'm not letting it go.</v>

01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm holding onto retard with my greasy Guinea pause until the bitter end.</v>

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:26.690
<v Speaker 1>They're all fucking children.</v>

2351
01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:28.010
<v Speaker 1>They're all fools.</v>

2352
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.431
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2353
01:08:28.431 --> 01:08:31.550
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you're an unkind person and you're saying retarded.</v>

2354
01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:33.590
<v Speaker 1>You're not saying it around.</v>

2355
01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:34.503
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>

2356
01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.560
<v Speaker 1>there's certain terms I won't use.</v>

2357
01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:37.041
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2358
01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:38.690
<v Speaker 1>I won't call someone a nigger.</v>

2359
01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:39.261
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2360
01:08:39.261 --> 01:08:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I won't call it.</v>

2361
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.210
<v Speaker 1>I stopped using faggot.</v>

2362
01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:44.660
<v Speaker 1>I'll use it with Brian occasionally when there's no one around,</v>

2363
01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.670
<v Speaker 1>but we're friends and I'm joking.</v>

2364
01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:47.361
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2365
01:08:47.361 --> 01:08:48.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2366
01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.010
<v Speaker 1>but I won't use it.</v>

2367
01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:52.010
<v Speaker 1>I never use it when I'm talking about a gay person.</v>

2368
01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:53.750
<v Speaker 1>I will not use any.</v>

2369
01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I won't ever marginalize someone based on some things that they can't control or</v>

2370
01:08:58.371 --> 01:08:59.204
<v Speaker 1>whoever they are,</v>

2371
01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.070
<v Speaker 1>but when someone's retarded,</v>

2372
01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.750
<v Speaker 1>it just means they're being an idiot,</v>

2373
01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:03.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2374
01:09:03.201 --> 01:09:05.120
<v Speaker 1>and it's not as good to say they're an idiot.</v>

2375
01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Like you fucking retard.</v>

2376
01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:07.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the right one.</v>

2377
01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:09.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want to say.</v>

2378
01:09:09.570 --> 01:09:09.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2379
01:09:09.841 --> 01:09:10.200
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

2380
01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not a medical term.</v>

2381
01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:12.620
<v Speaker 1>It never has been.</v>

2382
01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.290
<v Speaker 1>It used to be mongoloid idiot.</v>

2383
01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.840
<v Speaker 1>They used to actually say that on people's first.</v>

2384
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:18.743
<v Speaker 1>Soon as you said,</v>

2385
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.140
<v Speaker 1>it was like there was something in my chest that hurts.</v>

2386
01:09:21.141 --> 01:09:21.861
<v Speaker 1>You have a child.</v>

2387
01:09:21.861 --> 01:09:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2388
01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:23.120
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>

2389
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:24.223
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible that they,</v>

2390
01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:26.250
<v Speaker 1>that we were so insensitive that used.</v>

2391
01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.250
<v Speaker 1>We used to say mongoloid idiot,</v>

2392
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:29.810
<v Speaker 1>but it does feel like there's this list,</v>

2393
01:09:29.811 --> 01:09:30.051
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2394
01:09:30.051 --> 01:09:32.210
<v Speaker 1>That stuff's just slowly getting crossed off.</v>

2395
01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:33.133
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

<v Speaker 1>young women to call young women bossy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's like their job.</v>

2451
01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Some fields to just get angry at stuff.</v>

2452
01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:53.481
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2453
01:10:53.481 --> 01:10:54.530
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is.</v>

2454
01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:58.670
<v Speaker 1>People have the ability to affect some form of change.</v>

2455
01:10:58.790 --> 01:11:01.130
<v Speaker 1>You know how you touch your screen and you see that,</v>

2456
01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:01.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2457
01:11:01.331 --> 01:11:02.350
<v Speaker 1>you touch the LCD screen,</v>

2458
01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.360
<v Speaker 1>you see that weird indentation where your finger is and you're like,</v>

2459
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.751
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2460
01:11:05.751 --> 01:11:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I could change the screen with my finger,</v>

2461
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:11.480
<v Speaker 1>and so you just start poking at it and some of it makes sense and some of it</v>

2462
01:11:11.481 --> 01:11:12.080
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

2463
01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>But there's a bunch people out there that are</v>

2464
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.050
<v Speaker 3>incredibly over-sensitive,</v>

2465
01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:16.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2466
01:11:16.621 --> 01:11:18.510
<v Speaker 3>the social justice warrior crowd.</v>

2467
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:23.780
<v Speaker 3>Incredibly oversensitive and looking to like in some way pasteurize culture and</v>

2468
01:11:26.431 --> 01:11:29.670
<v Speaker 3>boil it down to this like completely inoffensive.</v>

2469
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Always punching up,</v>

2470
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:33.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2471
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:34.800
<v Speaker 3>sort of a environment.</v>

2472
01:11:34.801 --> 01:11:36.060
<v Speaker 3>And that's what,</v>

2473
01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.900
<v Speaker 3>that's the same sort of mentality that's trying to take away victory in</v>

2474
01:11:39.901 --> 01:11:40.950
<v Speaker 3>children's games.</v>

2475
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:43.800
<v Speaker 3>They don't want anybody to win because then someone has to lose.</v>

2476
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.191
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2477
01:11:44.191 --> 01:11:44.611
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>

2478
01:11:44.611 --> 01:11:45.330
<v Speaker 3>Fuck face.</v>

2479
01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:46.890
<v Speaker 3>That's how we get better.</v>

2480
01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.630
<v Speaker 3>You get better by feeling like shit,</v>

2481
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:49.381
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2482
01:11:49.381 --> 01:11:51.930
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways you get better socially,</v>

2483
01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:53.250
<v Speaker 3>you get rejected,</v>

2484
01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:53.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2485
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:54.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2486
01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:55.380
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens.</v>

2487
01:11:55.381 --> 01:11:56.161
<v Speaker 3>Like girls go,</v>

2488
01:11:56.161 --> 01:11:57.600
<v Speaker 3>you're a fucking loser and you go,</v>

2489
01:11:57.630 --> 01:11:58.051
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

2490
01:11:58.051 --> 01:11:58.884
<v Speaker 3>I'm a loser.</v>

2491
01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.540
<v Speaker 3>And then he'd go home and you get your shit together.</v>

2492
01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:00.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2493
01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:01.201
<v Speaker 4>When I was,</v>

2494
01:12:01.201 --> 01:12:01.801
<v Speaker 4>when I was little,</v>

2495
01:12:01.801 --> 01:12:02.634
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>

2496
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:04.300
<v Speaker 4>I went to a,</v>

2497
01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:05.320
<v Speaker 4>I went to,</v>

2498
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:06.120
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

2499
01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.790
<v Speaker 4>it was always like a subway or something and then like a karate studio right</v>

2500
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:09.540
<v Speaker 4>next to it.</v>

2501
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.910
<v Speaker 4>And I went there and I loved it for two years.</v>

2502
01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:13.230
<v Speaker 4>And then I went to my first tournament,</v>

2503
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:16.010
<v Speaker 4>I played like eighth and they,</v>

2504
01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:21.030
<v Speaker 4>the guy that ran it gave me a trophy for second place and when we got home my</v>

2505
01:12:21.031 --> 01:12:21.481
<v Speaker 4>dad was like,</v>

2506
01:12:21.481 --> 01:12:22.380
<v Speaker 4>we're throwing this out.</v>

2507
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:23.663
<v Speaker 4>You didn't earn this.</v>

2508
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:25.020
<v Speaker 4>And it's important.</v>

2509
01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.670
<v Speaker 4>It's important to earn stuff.</v>

2510
01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:28.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2511
01:12:28.051 --> 01:12:29.400
<v Speaker 3>It is important to earn stuff.</v>

2512
01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:33.870
<v Speaker 3>It's also important to realize if you're freaking out at a lot of the things</v>

2513
01:12:33.871 --> 01:12:34.920
<v Speaker 3>that we're saying right here,</v>

2514
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:38.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't really mean this 100 percent.</v>

2515
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:38.761
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2516
01:12:38.761 --> 01:12:40.380
<v Speaker 3>like when I'm saying looked at twitter who were like,</v>

2517
01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:40.970
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

2518
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:41.300
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2519
01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:41.550
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2520
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:42.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's happening,</v>

2521
01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:43.201
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>

2522
01:12:43.201 --> 01:12:45.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't really mean it when I'm saying like</v>

2523
01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:48.750
<v Speaker 3>when I'm here,</v>

2524
01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:50.043
<v Speaker 3>here's a problem.</v>

2525
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:55.550
<v Speaker 3>People are extremely sensitive about certain subjects and when people joke</v>

2526
01:12:56.671 --> 01:12:58.650
<v Speaker 3>around about those subjects,</v>

2527
01:12:59.040 --> 01:12:59.910
<v Speaker 3>people freak out,</v>

2528
01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:00.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2529
01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:02.970
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't mean that you're a bad person.</v>

2530
01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:07.170
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that you really hate anybody,</v>

2531
01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:12.680
<v Speaker 3>but people like to have fun and talk shit and when people like to have fun and</v>

2532
01:13:13.351 --> 01:13:17.580
<v Speaker 3>talk shit and people jump all over it as if this is some sort of a statement</v>

2533
01:13:17.581 --> 01:13:19.950
<v Speaker 3>they're giving a court like some sort of an affidavit,</v>

2534
01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.031
<v Speaker 3>like you're,</v>

2535
01:13:21.031 --> 01:13:24.450
<v Speaker 3>you're missing out on the subtle nuances of human interaction.</v>

2536
01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.720
<v Speaker 3>Like people say things that they don't really mean because it's funny,</v>

2537
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:28.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2538
01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.340
<v Speaker 3>Because they're fucking around.</v>

2539
01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:29.791
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2540
01:13:29.791 --> 01:13:31.460
<v Speaker 4>I think what Bill Burke covers that in his new,</v>

2541
01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.820
<v Speaker 4>a new special on Netflix.</v>

2542
01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:33.331
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2543
01:13:33.331 --> 01:13:33.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2544
01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:34.490
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>

2545
01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:34.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2546
01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:36.570
<v Speaker 4>It's just like people taking stuff where it's like,</v>

2547
01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.830
<v Speaker 4>obviously I'm joking.</v>

2548
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:40.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I should beat my wife.</v>

2549
01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:40.761
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2550
01:13:40.761 --> 01:13:44.090
<v Speaker 3>I had a whole bit about it in my comedy central special about,</v>

2551
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:45.201
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2552
01:13:45.201 --> 01:13:45.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2553
01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:47.960
<v Speaker 3>Tracy Morgan about Tracy Morgan's.</v>

2554
01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:51.620
<v Speaker 3>I think I actually just confused you with what I was thinking too,</v>

2555
01:13:51.650 --> 01:13:53.930
<v Speaker 3>because I just watched bill special.</v>

2556
01:13:53.931 --> 01:13:55.280
<v Speaker 3>I didn't remember that part,</v>

2557
01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:59.510
<v Speaker 3>but that the Tracy Morgan thing with Tracy Morgan got in trouble for saying that</v>

2558
01:13:59.511 --> 01:14:00.201
<v Speaker 3>if his son was gay,</v>

2559
01:14:00.201 --> 01:14:01.034
<v Speaker 3>he would stab them.</v>

2560
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.350
<v Speaker 3>Obviously that's a horrible thing.</v>

2561
01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:07.040
<v Speaker 3>But he also said that he would eat a mile of shit to get to beyonce is booty</v>

2562
01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:09.200
<v Speaker 3>like that's the part of in my act like come on.</v>

2563
01:14:09.201 --> 01:14:12.910
<v Speaker 3>He says ridiculous shit that's not actually true.</v>

2564
01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:18.060
<v Speaker 3>And he's saying it in a medium and entertainment medium where if you watch a</v>

2565
01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:19.420
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>

2566
01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:19.901
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2567
01:14:19.901 --> 01:14:23.110
<v Speaker 3>and the transformers destroy these buildings and someone gets stomped,</v>

2568
01:14:23.111 --> 01:14:23.501
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>

2569
01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:24.610
<v Speaker 3>No one really got stomped.</v>

2570
01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.020
<v Speaker 3>No buildings really got destroyed.</v>

2571
01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.940
<v Speaker 3>Bob Marley didn't really shoot the sheriff,</v>

2572
01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:28.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2573
01:14:28.181 --> 01:14:29.320
<v Speaker 3>that's the point of the,</v>

2574
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:30.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2575
01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:30.863
<v Speaker 3>the bit.</v>

2576
01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:31.893
<v Speaker 3>But this,</v>

2577
01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:37.050
<v Speaker 3>this idea that everything is supposed to be homogenized and calm down and come</v>

2578
01:14:37.511 --> 01:14:37.751
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

2579
01:14:37.751 --> 01:14:38.410
<v Speaker 3>this is ridiculous.</v>

2580
01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:38.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2581
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:42.760
<v Speaker 4>I think we all want to society right where we all have our worth based on what</v>

2582
01:14:42.761 --> 01:14:43.560
<v Speaker 4>we do and like we,</v>

2583
01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:44.590
<v Speaker 4>we respect each other,</v>

2584
01:14:44.591 --> 01:14:47.500
<v Speaker 4>but not so much where there is no fun.</v>

2585
01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:48.141
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2586
01:14:48.141 --> 01:14:48.980
<v Speaker 3>There's no fun left.</v>

2587
01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2588
01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:54.700
<v Speaker 3>And part of the fun is saying Shit that you look like you're you,</v>

2589
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:56.660
<v Speaker 3>you say shit.</v>

2590
01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.550
<v Speaker 3>That is ridiculous.</v>

2591
01:14:58.730 --> 01:15:03.730
<v Speaker 3>That is fun to say because you know that you don't mean it and you assume that</v>

2592
01:15:04.101 --> 01:15:09.101
<v Speaker 3>your friends know you don't mean it as well and that's part of the subtle nuance</v>

2593
01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:13.940
<v Speaker 3>of fucking around with your friends and the problem with trying to do that in</v>

2594
01:15:13.941 --> 01:15:16.490
<v Speaker 3>public is that people will latch onto that.</v>

2595
01:15:16.491 --> 01:15:17.181
<v Speaker 3>They'll take it,</v>

2596
01:15:17.181 --> 01:15:18.380
<v Speaker 3>they'll take it as a quote,</v>

2597
01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:22.190
<v Speaker 3>they'll put it in quotes and they'll pretend that this is an actual statement</v>

2598
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:24.710
<v Speaker 3>and this is how you actually believe and feel,</v>

2599
01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:26.660
<v Speaker 3>and then they'll just write a blog about it.</v>

2600
01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:30.020
<v Speaker 3>They'll write a tumblr blog and get super upset about it and that's what you're</v>

2601
01:15:30.021 --> 01:15:30.681
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

2602
01:15:30.681 --> 01:15:33.350
<v Speaker 3>Like don't you say retard someone's gonna write this huge blog,</v>

2603
01:15:33.351 --> 01:15:34.190
<v Speaker 3>but he hate people.</v>

2604
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:35.960
<v Speaker 3>That's not what's going on.</v>

2605
01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:39.850
<v Speaker 3>It's not what's going on and in pretending what you're doing is you're focusing</v>

2606
01:15:39.851 --> 01:15:43.850
<v Speaker 3>on something that's not really that important and you're pretending it is and</v>

2607
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:45.560
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of real issues in the world,</v>

2608
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.801
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2609
01:15:45.801 --> 01:15:50.420
<v Speaker 3>You could be focusing your attention on instead of someone saying retard or</v>

2610
01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.201
<v Speaker 3>someone saying,</v>

2611
01:15:51.201 --> 01:15:54.250
<v Speaker 3>your mom's going to have a giant black robot fucked all that.</v>

2612
01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:56.330
<v Speaker 3>That throws Dick all day,</v>

2613
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:58.040
<v Speaker 3>all day,</v>

2614
01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.540
<v Speaker 3>and she's going to kick your dad out of the house.</v>

2615
01:15:59.541 --> 01:16:00.710
<v Speaker 3>You fat fucking loser.</v>

2616
01:16:00.711 --> 01:16:01.461
<v Speaker 3>You'd get Outta here.</v>

2617
01:16:01.461 --> 01:16:02.540
<v Speaker 3>Arnold's gonna fuck me now.</v>

2618
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2619
01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:03.920
<v Speaker 3>but that's not real.</v>

2620
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:04.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2621
01:16:04.190 --> 01:16:05.390
<v Speaker 3>We don't really mean that,</v>

2622
01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:09.440
<v Speaker 3>but we live in this time where anybody has a voice.</v>

2623
01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:14.560
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can just write something on twitter or write something on facebook or</v>

2624
01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.370
<v Speaker 3>Tumblr and I think that's good.</v>

2625
01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.233
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good,</v>

2626
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:22.450
<v Speaker 3>but right now there's a sort of balancing out stage where people are still</v>

2627
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.910
<v Speaker 3>freaking out about these things and they're just like this,</v>

2628
01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:31.280
<v Speaker 3>this sort of new understanding of this ability,</v>

2629
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:33.980
<v Speaker 3>this new understanding of this ability to freak out about that.</v>

2630
01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:34.341
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2631
01:16:34.341 --> 01:16:36.260
<v Speaker 4>but I think a lot of people don't realize the power.</v>

2632
01:16:36.261 --> 01:16:36.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2633
01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:36.920
<v Speaker 4>the main,</v>

2634
01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:40.070
<v Speaker 4>the main thing that you see specifically with celebrities and sometimes they'll,</v>

2635
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:42.890
<v Speaker 4>they'll say something just offhand and then it'll just,</v>

2636
01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:46.790
<v Speaker 4>it we will get warped and then other people feeling like they're so small that</v>

2637
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.040
<v Speaker 4>they can just literally say anything,</v>

2638
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:52.880
<v Speaker 4>anything like the most vile crap ever because it's the internet and they're</v>

2639
01:16:52.881 --> 01:16:53.060
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

2640
01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:53.893
<v Speaker 4>And it's fun.</v>

2641
01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:54.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2642
01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:54.961
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2643
01:16:54.961 --> 01:16:56.490
<v Speaker 3>That is a thing that people do.</v>

2644
01:16:56.491 --> 01:16:57.420
<v Speaker 3>Like Jonah Hill,</v>

2645
01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.100
<v Speaker 3>when he called some reporter,</v>

2646
01:16:59.450 --> 01:17:00.960
<v Speaker 3>he called someone a faggot.</v>

2647
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:02.310
<v Speaker 3>It was like the guy that was like,</v>

2648
01:17:02.311 --> 01:17:02.431
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2649
01:17:02.431 --> 01:17:03.290
<v Speaker 3>he was like harassing him,</v>

2650
01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.050
<v Speaker 3>not alone.</v>

2651
01:17:04.050 --> 01:17:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2652
01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:05.251
<v Speaker 3>And then he,</v>

2653
01:17:05.251 --> 01:17:05.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2654
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:10.430
<v Speaker 3>he sort of apologized for it and it became like a big and became the word he</v>

2655
01:17:10.761 --> 01:17:15.020
<v Speaker 3>used became more important than someone like following him around and sticking a</v>

2656
01:17:15.021 --> 01:17:15.771
<v Speaker 3>camera in his face,</v>

2657
01:17:15.771 --> 01:17:16.700
<v Speaker 3>violating his,</v>

2658
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.780
<v Speaker 3>his personal freedom or violating his privacy,</v>

2659
01:17:21.450 --> 01:17:21.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2660
01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:23.360
<v Speaker 3>it became all about a word,</v>

2661
01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:24.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2662
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:24.701
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2663
01:17:24.701 --> 01:17:25.550
<v Speaker 3>And that's unfortunate.</v>

2664
01:17:25.551 --> 01:17:27.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like he chose the wrong word,</v>

2665
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2666
01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:28.330
<v Speaker 3>if he said,</v>

2667
01:17:28.330 --> 01:17:28.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2668
01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:29.211
<v Speaker 3>get out of here,</v>

2669
01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:30.410
<v Speaker 3>you fucking parasite.</v>

2670
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Then it would have been more about the behavior of the person falling him with a</v>

2671
01:17:34.071 --> 01:17:37.110
<v Speaker 3>camera that it would have been about him reacting to that person with</v>

2672
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:38.200
<v Speaker 4>well and the whole,</v>

2673
01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:38.511
<v Speaker 4>the whole.</v>

2674
01:17:38.511 --> 01:17:39.740
<v Speaker 4>That whole story ended up being.</v>

2675
01:17:39.741 --> 01:17:39.900
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2676
01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.500
<v Speaker 4>specifically about the word and then his apology for it.</v>

2677
01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:47.090
<v Speaker 4>Which it's always interesting to see famous people go on like a tonight show or</v>

2678
01:17:47.091 --> 01:17:48.310
<v Speaker 4>something like that to apologize.</v>

2679
01:17:48.370 --> 01:17:49.190
<v Speaker 4>Tie On.</v>

2680
01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:49.431
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2681
01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:50.890
<v Speaker 4>And you're just like,</v>

2682
01:17:51.210 --> 01:17:52.440
<v Speaker 4>we know that this is like,</v>

2683
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:54.200
<v Speaker 4>it's a setup moment.</v>

2684
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.771
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2685
01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:56.780
<v Speaker 4>And it's like you giving this statement and it's just,</v>

2686
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:57.643
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2687
01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:58.513
<v Speaker 4>it's so weird.</v>

2688
01:17:58.530 --> 01:17:59.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2689
01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:00.383
<v Speaker 3>It's sad.</v>

2690
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:01.463
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2691
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:02.401
<v Speaker 3>But it is,</v>

2692
01:18:02.401 --> 01:18:02.971
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2693
01:18:02.971 --> 01:18:03.990
<v Speaker 3>people are scared.</v>

2694
01:18:04.170 --> 01:18:06.540
<v Speaker 3>They're scared of a PR thing,</v>

2695
01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.100
<v Speaker 4>but that's also a thing that I understand.</v>

2696
01:18:08.101 --> 01:18:11.830
<v Speaker 4>Like I never had to grow up worried that I was going to beat.</v>

2697
01:18:11.831 --> 01:18:14.970
<v Speaker 4>I get beat up because of my sexual orientation that no one was ever going to</v>

2698
01:18:14.971 --> 01:18:16.560
<v Speaker 4>like tie me to a fence and beat me to death.</v>

2699
01:18:16.561 --> 01:18:17.394
<v Speaker 4>So when,</v>

2700
01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.210
<v Speaker 4>when I think a lot of people take it to the next level when they talk about</v>

2701
01:18:21.211 --> 01:18:26.211
<v Speaker 4>things like where I like offhand mention white privilege because I didn't have</v>

2702
01:18:26.791 --> 01:18:27.570
<v Speaker 4>to go through that.</v>

2703
01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:31.680
<v Speaker 4>I do get annoyed by the people on the extreme end of the argument that act like</v>

2704
01:18:31.681 --> 01:18:35.930
<v Speaker 4>I can't have an opinion on anything because of the color of my skin and my and</v>

2705
01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:38.580
<v Speaker 4>my and my and my sexual orientation or any of these things.</v>

2706
01:18:38.581 --> 01:18:39.240
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

2707
01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:39.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2708
01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:40.310
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

2709
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.560
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2710
01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.330
<v Speaker 4>it's the world is gray man.</v>

2711
01:18:42.331 --> 01:18:42.720
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

2712
01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:43.690
<v Speaker 3>It is very gray.</v>

2713
01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:44.470
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

2714
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:45.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2715
01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:45.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2716
01:18:45.401 --> 01:18:47.020
<v Speaker 3>would you use the term like,</v>

2717
01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:47.973
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2718
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.550
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2719
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:49.750
<v Speaker 3>if I said shut up bitch,</v>

2720
01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:51.340
<v Speaker 3>would you use that?</v>

2721
01:18:51.370 --> 01:18:54.460
<v Speaker 3>If you are around a woman who had just been called a bitch,</v>

2722
01:18:54.670 --> 01:18:54.941
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2723
01:18:54.941 --> 01:18:57.850
<v Speaker 3>if someone had just yelled at you stupid bitch at a woman,</v>

2724
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.460
<v Speaker 3>which is the worst way you could use that term.</v>

2725
01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:02.450
<v Speaker 3>Would I still say to Barnes,</v>

2726
01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:02.951
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

2727
01:19:02.951 --> 01:19:03.784
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck out of here.</v>

2728
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:06.190
<v Speaker 3>Then you would be more sensitive about.</v>

2729
01:19:06.191 --> 01:19:06.551
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like,</v>

2730
01:19:06.551 --> 01:19:07.690
<v Speaker 3>well I can't.</v>

2731
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:09.020
<v Speaker 3>We've got to get away from this chicken,</v>

2732
01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:09.873
<v Speaker 3>then I'll call you a bitch,</v>

2733
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:10.833
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2734
01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:14.590
<v Speaker 3>or I'll use the term bitch about myself,</v>

2735
01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:15.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2736
01:19:15.191 --> 01:19:15.760
<v Speaker 3>I'll say,</v>

2737
01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:16.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2738
01:19:16.421 --> 01:19:19.150
<v Speaker 3>I'll do something stupid.</v>

2739
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:20.051
<v Speaker 3>I'll be like,</v>

2740
01:19:20.051 --> 01:19:20.381
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

2741
01:19:20.381 --> 01:19:22.510
<v Speaker 3>do you even know how to fucking turn your car?</v>

2742
01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:23.373
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2743
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.830
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

2744
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:28.000
<v Speaker 3>I'll use it at me as well as I'll use it at someone else.</v>

2745
01:19:28.150 --> 01:19:31.600
<v Speaker 3>But would I do that if somebody had just been called it in a very hateful way?</v>

2746
01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:32.180
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2747
01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:33.370
<v Speaker 3>but that's where it gets weird.</v>

2748
01:19:33.371 --> 01:19:34.420
<v Speaker 3>That's where it gets gray,</v>

2749
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:35.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2750
01:19:35.021 --> 01:19:38.020
<v Speaker 3>like that's why the word faggot is just like,</v>

2751
01:19:38.021 --> 01:19:42.610
<v Speaker 3>it's just too complicated because even though the intent is what's important</v>

2752
01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:47.611
<v Speaker 3>when you're dealing with words like in the intent is not homosexual slur.</v>

2753
01:19:48.911 --> 01:19:51.900
<v Speaker 3>Your friend is a homosexual and you're making no.</v>

2754
01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:54.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's a wimp or he's.</v>

2755
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:55.091
<v Speaker 3>And then you go,</v>

2756
01:19:55.091 --> 01:19:55.331
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2757
01:19:55.331 --> 01:19:55.571
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2758
01:19:55.571 --> 01:19:56.111
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

2759
01:19:56.111 --> 01:19:56.290
<v Speaker 3>Then?</v>

2760
01:19:56.290 --> 01:19:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean that gay men are wimps?</v>

2761
01:19:57.551 --> 01:19:57.761
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2762
01:19:57.761 --> 01:19:58.001
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2763
01:19:58.001 --> 01:19:58.834
<v Speaker 3>that's not what you mean.</v>

2764
01:19:58.930 --> 01:19:59.111
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2765
01:19:59.111 --> 01:20:00.670
<v Speaker 3>you probably need to come up with a better word.</v>

2766
01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:01.690
<v Speaker 3>It's like the word.</v>

2767
01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:05.230
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that word is that it's ineffective and conveying the actual</v>

2768
01:20:05.231 --> 01:20:06.910
<v Speaker 3>thought because it's too easily,</v>

2769
01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:12.890
<v Speaker 3>it's too easily connected to gay slurs or two things that have incredibly</v>

2770
01:20:13.171 --> 01:20:18.171
<v Speaker 3>negative connotations or are just their prejudice terms,</v>

2771
01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:20.600
<v Speaker 3>so you have to kind of let them go and come up with something else.</v>

2772
01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:20.911
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2773
01:20:20.911 --> 01:20:21.744
<v Speaker 4>I leave it alone.</v>

2774
01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:23.580
<v Speaker 4>If it's those two words,</v>

2775
01:20:23.581 --> 01:20:24.480
<v Speaker 4>I say,</v>

2776
01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:25.020
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

2777
01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:28.110
<v Speaker 4>those groups can talk about it and Louis Ck can talk about it and that's it.</v>

2778
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.161
<v Speaker 4>I just stay away.</v>

2779
01:20:29.161 --> 01:20:29.431
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2780
01:20:29.431 --> 01:20:29.910
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>

2781
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:30.180
<v Speaker 4>nope.</v>

2782
01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:30.910
<v Speaker 4>Not going to say it.</v>

2783
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:31.930
<v Speaker 3>Those two groups.</v>

2784
01:20:31.931 --> 01:20:32.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2785
01:20:32.201 --> 01:20:34.960
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about gay people are allowed to use the f word.</v>

2786
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.943
<v Speaker 3>They could say it,</v>

2787
01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:37.120
<v Speaker 3>they call each other fags,</v>

2788
01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:38.910
<v Speaker 4>but if I was,</v>

2789
01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:39.481
<v Speaker 4>oh man,</v>

2790
01:20:39.481 --> 01:20:43.760
<v Speaker 4>if I was black I would just use that word to all my white friends just because</v>

2791
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:45.210
<v Speaker 4>some like some will get excited,</v>

2792
01:20:45.211 --> 01:20:46.110
<v Speaker 4>but others would just be like,</v>

2793
01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:48.293
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2794
01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:50.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to leave this situation right now.</v>

2795
01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:51.841
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2796
01:20:51.841 --> 01:20:52.381
<v Speaker 4>It's funny,</v>

2797
01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:52.711
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2798
01:20:52.711 --> 01:20:53.270
<v Speaker 4>It's funny.</v>

2799
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.850
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

2800
01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:55.560
<v Speaker 3>languages is an incredible thing.</v>

2801
01:20:55.770 --> 01:20:56.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's so much.</v>

2802
01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:58.080
<v Speaker 3>There's so much subtlety,</v>

2803
01:20:58.110 --> 01:20:58.741
<v Speaker 3>there's so much.</v>

2804
01:20:58.741 --> 01:21:03.600
<v Speaker 3>There's so many different ways you can say a sentence and have different</v>

2805
01:21:03.601 --> 01:21:04.230
<v Speaker 3>meanings,</v>

2806
01:21:04.230 --> 01:21:04.831
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2807
01:21:04.831 --> 01:21:09.360
<v Speaker 3>and people are really sensitive about that today more than ever because we can</v>

2808
01:21:09.361 --> 01:21:12.480
<v Speaker 3>analyze things in a way and then communicate our analysis,</v>

2809
01:21:12.481 --> 01:21:13.340
<v Speaker 3>communicate our,</v>

2810
01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:13.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2811
01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:17.160
<v Speaker 3>our interpretation of how you're speaking and communicate that.</v>

2812
01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:21.240
<v Speaker 3>And all you have to do is say something like if you say something fucked up and</v>

2813
01:21:21.241 --> 01:21:23.250
<v Speaker 3>someone takes it completely out of context,</v>

2814
01:21:23.251 --> 01:21:25.080
<v Speaker 3>you put it on twitter or facebook,</v>

2815
01:21:25.081 --> 01:21:26.220
<v Speaker 3>whatever you like,</v>

2816
01:21:26.221 --> 01:21:26.510
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2817
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:27.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2818
01:21:27.170 --> 01:21:29.220
<v Speaker 3>that sort of click baity in a lot of ways.</v>

2819
01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.730
<v Speaker 3>But it also a lot of ways like you did say that word,</v>

2820
01:21:32.970 --> 01:21:33.241
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2821
01:21:33.241 --> 01:21:34.680
<v Speaker 3>you did say it in that term,</v>

2822
01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:38.520
<v Speaker 3>but it's not in the greater context of the conversation that you're having,</v>

2823
01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:39.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2824
01:21:39.001 --> 01:21:42.120
<v Speaker 3>and that's what's lost in the flat medium of print.</v>

2825
01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:45.870
<v Speaker 3>That two dimensional medium of taking something in quotes and putting it in</v>

2826
01:21:45.871 --> 01:21:49.350
<v Speaker 3>print and that sort of the point that I was trying to make in my comedy central</v>

2827
01:21:49.351 --> 01:21:50.130
<v Speaker 3>special.</v>

2828
01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:50.963
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

2829
01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:51.321
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2830
01:21:51.321 --> 01:21:54.960
<v Speaker 3>that's something that's being lost today when people were just looking for</v>

2831
01:21:54.961 --> 01:21:56.160
<v Speaker 3>things to be upset about.</v>

2832
01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.430
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2833
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:58.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2834
01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:58.520
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2835
01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:01.600
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I am constantly dodging stuff like that.</v>

2836
01:22:01.601 --> 01:22:05.440
<v Speaker 4>Just because someone said you can't say thug anymore.</v>

2837
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:06.291
<v Speaker 4>I was quote,</v>

2838
01:22:06.291 --> 01:22:08.980
<v Speaker 4>I was quoting someone and I said ratchet.</v>

2839
01:22:08.981 --> 01:22:10.520
<v Speaker 4>And I liked and I like,</v>

2840
01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:11.070
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2841
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:11.300
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

2842
01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:12.010
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

2843
01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:12.760
<v Speaker 4>oh whoa.</v>

2844
01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:13.120
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2845
01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:13.301
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2846
01:22:13.301 --> 01:22:14.110
<v Speaker 4>she ratchet.</v>

2847
01:22:14.110 --> 01:22:15.150
<v Speaker 4>And that's when I,</v>

2848
01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.590
<v Speaker 4>when I say like the tumbler posts of like 200,000,</v>

2849
01:22:17.591 --> 01:22:18.191
<v Speaker 4>there was a tumblr post,</v>

2850
01:22:18.191 --> 01:22:22.600
<v Speaker 4>I think it has like a $100,000 that I used a aggressive racialized language.</v>

2851
01:22:22.601 --> 01:22:23.130
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2852
01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:23.840
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

2853
01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:24.673
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2854
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:26.103
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2855
01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:27.820
<v Speaker 4>what's wrong with ratchet?</v>

2856
01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:28.421
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2857
01:22:28.421 --> 01:22:29.180
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2858
01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:30.180
<v Speaker 4>you can't say ratchet.</v>

2859
01:22:30.181 --> 01:22:31.870
<v Speaker 4>It speaks down to</v>

2860
01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:37.170
<v Speaker 4>ratchet is like a tool in reference to a person,</v>

2861
01:22:37.171 --> 01:22:37.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2862
01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:38.260
<v Speaker 4>that's like an earth.</v>

2863
01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:38.520
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2864
01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that.</v>

2865
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.651
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2866
01:22:39.651 --> 01:22:39.860
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2867
01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:40.290
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2868
01:22:40.290 --> 01:22:40.630
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2869
01:22:40.630 --> 01:22:41.381
<v Speaker 4>like that girl,</v>

2870
01:22:41.381 --> 01:22:42.131
<v Speaker 4>look at her shoes,</v>

2871
01:22:42.131 --> 01:22:44.560
<v Speaker 4>they're so ratchet or that girl is ratchet,</v>

2872
01:22:44.561 --> 01:22:47.250
<v Speaker 4>meaning like she is like,</v>

2873
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:49.510
<v Speaker 4>like what would it be?</v>

2874
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:50.560
<v Speaker 4>Like trashy.</v>

2875
01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:50.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2876
01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:51.311
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2877
01:22:51.311 --> 01:22:51.491
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2878
01:22:51.491 --> 01:22:51.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2879
01:22:51.970 --> 01:22:53.680
<v Speaker 4>but I also can't keep up with stuff.</v>

2880
01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:56.650
<v Speaker 4>I think that's when I realized I'm getting old where I'm just like,</v>

2881
01:22:56.651 --> 01:22:57.790
<v Speaker 4>I see new words and I'm like,</v>

2882
01:22:57.791 --> 01:22:58.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to care.</v>

2883
01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:00.040
<v Speaker 4>Like I saw there was,</v>

2884
01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:02.400
<v Speaker 4>is it pronounced here?</v>

2885
01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if it's an inappropriate word,</v>

2886
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:06.460
<v Speaker 4>but like thought it's like t h o,</v>

2887
01:23:06.461 --> 01:23:06.761
<v Speaker 4>t,</v>

2888
01:23:06.761 --> 01:23:07.630
<v Speaker 4>and I think it just means like,</v>

2889
01:23:07.631 --> 01:23:08.280
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

2890
01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.090
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2891
01:23:09.090 --> 01:23:09.923
<v Speaker 4>And I'm just like,</v>

2892
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.250
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

2893
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.760
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

2894
01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:11.350
<v Speaker 4>hold on,</v>

2895
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.691
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>

2896
01:23:11.691 --> 01:23:13.090
<v Speaker 4>I need a new word that's bigger.</v>

2897
01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.070
<v Speaker 4>I am so out of the loop.</v>

2898
01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:15.310
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2899
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting old.</v>

2900
01:23:15.970 --> 01:23:17.830
<v Speaker 4>So ratchet is what,</v>

2901
01:23:18.130 --> 01:23:19.390
<v Speaker 4>like trashy,</v>

2902
01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:20.140
<v Speaker 4>trashy,</v>

2903
01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:20.291
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2904
01:23:20.291 --> 01:23:21.490
<v Speaker 4>like she's so ratchet.</v>

2905
01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:23.830
<v Speaker 4>Hold the neck.</v>

2906
01:23:23.831 --> 01:23:24.430
<v Speaker 4>Can you do that again?</v>

2907
01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:25.263
<v Speaker 4>She's so rad.</v>

2908
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:28.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean I did a 25 year old Latina.</v>

2909
01:23:28.001 --> 01:23:30.100
<v Speaker 4>That's the only reason I go.</v>

2910
01:23:30.170 --> 01:23:31.003
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2911
01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:33.160
<v Speaker 4>And so ratchet is bad.</v>

2912
01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:34.780
<v Speaker 4>You get in trouble for saying ratchet.</v>

2913
01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:35.910
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think I would,</v>

2914
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:36.170
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>

2915
01:23:36.170 --> 01:23:37.630
<v Speaker 4>I was quoting it and then uh,</v>

2916
01:23:37.631 --> 01:23:37.871
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2917
01:23:37.871 --> 01:23:38.650
<v Speaker 4>And then it just.</v>

2918
01:23:38.650 --> 01:23:41.020
<v Speaker 4>But that's the thing is people just take the sentence,</v>

2919
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:42.190
<v Speaker 4>put it in quotes.</v>

2920
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:45.410
<v Speaker 1>As we were doing this conversation,</v>

2921
01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:50.440
<v Speaker 1>someone actually responded exactly the way I was mocking.</v>

2922
01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:53.510
<v Speaker 1>This is on twitter in quotes.</v>

2923
01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.700
<v Speaker 1>That bitch should just shut the fuck up.</v>

2924
01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:59.000
<v Speaker 1>She's lucky you feed her an exact quote,</v>

2925
01:23:59.001 --> 01:24:00.380
<v Speaker 1>all caps from Joe Rogan.</v>

2926
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Alyssa,</v>

2927
01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:02.660
<v Speaker 1>you fucking dummy.</v>

2928
01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:05.240
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about robots.</v>

2929
01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:07.760
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about robot fuck dolls.</v>

2930
01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Fake scenarios,</v>

2931
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:10.430
<v Speaker 1>and by the way dummy,</v>

2932
01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I also said that in the term of the woman mocking the man and kicking him out,</v>

2933
01:24:15.231 --> 01:24:17.270
<v Speaker 1>which you conveniently decided not to quote.</v>

2934
01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:18.471
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2935
01:24:18.471 --> 01:24:19.310
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm saying.</v>

2936
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:21.760
<v Speaker 1>If women were to just get fucked,</v>

2937
01:24:21.761 --> 01:24:23.600
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be feminist in quotes.</v>

2938
01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Literally a thing Joe Rogan just said,</v>

2939
01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:26.690
<v Speaker 1>did I say that</v>

2940
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.940
<v Speaker 4>you should go.</v>

2941
01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:30.640
<v Speaker 4>You should go through and see how long that person has been quoting you.</v>

2942
01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Did I say if women were to just get fucked,</v>

2943
01:24:33.111 --> 01:24:34.070
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be feminist.</v>

2944
01:24:34.071 --> 01:24:34.904
<v Speaker 1>That I say that,</v>

2945
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.943
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2946
01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.180
<v Speaker 1>this is hilarious.</v>

2947
01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:41.780
<v Speaker 1>This philly d interviews should just be called the Joe Rogan sexist,</v>

2948
01:24:41.781 --> 01:24:42.620
<v Speaker 1>our this.</v>

2949
01:24:42.970 --> 01:24:46.910
<v Speaker 1>This gal must be a wonderful person to hang out with.</v>

2950
01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:50.090
<v Speaker 1>She's not oversensitive at all.</v>

2951
01:24:50.150 --> 01:24:50.241
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2952
01:24:50.241 --> 01:24:50.781
<v Speaker 1>here's another thing.</v>

2953
01:24:50.781 --> 01:24:53.210
<v Speaker 1>She wrote dear men of the universe in all caps.</v>

2954
01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:54.890
<v Speaker 1>In the grand scheme of things,</v>

2955
01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:57.020
<v Speaker 1>your Dick is so insignificant.</v>

2956
01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:58.093
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

2957
01:24:58.270 --> 01:24:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2958
01:24:58.640 --> 01:24:59.473
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

2959
01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:01.100
<v Speaker 1>You have to tell everybody that though.</v>

2960
01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want to diminish a man by saying that in the greater scheme of the</v>

2961
01:25:05.271 --> 01:25:05.550
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

2962
01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2963
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:06.710
<v Speaker 1>The greater scheme of things,</v>

2964
01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:08.570
<v Speaker 1>your fucking ears are insignificant.</v>

2965
01:25:08.571 --> 01:25:09.290
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

2966
01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Your nose is insignificant to.</v>

2967
01:25:11.090 --> 01:25:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Who cares if you smell farts in the greater scheme of the universe?</v>

2968
01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:14.680
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2969
01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:16.880
<v Speaker 1>this is exactly what we were talking about.</v>

2970
01:25:16.881 --> 01:25:20.930
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing when you talk about something,</v>

2971
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:24.350
<v Speaker 1>you mock it and then someone misconstrues.</v>

2972
01:25:24.351 --> 01:25:27.590
<v Speaker 1>It's so badly that they literally become what you're mocking.</v>

2973
01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:28.250
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2974
01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:28.611
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

2975
01:25:28.611 --> 01:25:32.000
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing to me because I usually have to wait at least like for the video to</v>

2976
01:25:32.001 --> 01:25:32.420
<v Speaker 4>post,</v>

2977
01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:34.490
<v Speaker 4>so I love that it's happening in real time for you.</v>

2978
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:34.941
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2979
01:25:34.941 --> 01:25:35.240
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

2980
01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:35.421
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2981
01:25:35.421 --> 01:25:36.440
<v Speaker 4>that's the beauty of it</v>

2982
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:37.540
<v Speaker 1>being on ustream.</v>

2983
01:25:37.570 --> 01:25:38.403
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

2984
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:40.900
<v Speaker 1>People are looking to be upset.</v>

2985
01:25:40.901 --> 01:25:41.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2986
01:25:41.171 --> 01:25:42.880
<v Speaker 1>we are in a strange time now.</v>

2987
01:25:42.881 --> 01:25:44.320
<v Speaker 1>We're a hundred Pakistani.</v>

2988
01:25:44.321 --> 01:25:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Kids were murdered the other day.</v>

2989
01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:50.560
<v Speaker 1>We have what's going on in Ferguson where there's constant rioting.</v>

2990
01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:54.250
<v Speaker 1>We have all this crazy shit that's every fucking day.</v>

2991
01:25:54.251 --> 01:25:57.670
<v Speaker 1>There's some new video of a cop beating the fuck out of somebody.</v>

2992
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
<v Speaker 1>We have horrific injustice all over the world and people are getting upset about</v>

2993
01:26:03.321 --> 01:26:04.250
<v Speaker 1>a conversation</v>

2994
01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:06.380
<v Speaker 3>involving robot fuck towels.</v>

2995
01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:08.133
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2996
01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.480
<v Speaker 3>sexism,</v>

2997
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:10.551
<v Speaker 3>sexism,</v>

2998
01:26:10.551 --> 01:26:11.331
<v Speaker 3>a real problem.</v>

2999
01:26:11.331 --> 01:26:16.331
<v Speaker 3>No Man would ever freak out that much about a woman talking about robot.</v>

3000
01:26:17.271 --> 01:26:18.170
<v Speaker 3>Fuck men,</v>

3001
01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.670
<v Speaker 3>and that is true.</v>

3002
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:21.650
<v Speaker 3>If they would,</v>

3003
01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:21.890
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

3004
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:25.010
<v Speaker 3>They need to give up their men colored cars.</v>

3005
01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.000
<v Speaker 3>They're bitches.</v>

3006
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:27.900
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3007
01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:28.733
<v Speaker 3>picture,</v>

3008
01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:31.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to the rest of this entire podcast.</v>

3009
01:26:31.441 --> 01:26:32.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to be looking at your twitter.</v>

3010
01:26:32.770 --> 01:26:33.561
<v Speaker 4>Don't do it,</v>

3011
01:26:33.561 --> 01:26:33.811
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

3012
01:26:33.811 --> 01:26:34.644
<v Speaker 4>Don't do it</v>

3013
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:35.170
<v Speaker 3>sick.</v>

3014
01:26:35.170 --> 01:26:35.950
<v Speaker 3>It's toxic.</v>

3015
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:38.560
<v Speaker 3>It's filled with toxic masculinity at twitter.</v>

3016
01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:43.780
<v Speaker 3>Men's rights associations bother me way more than feminism tell.</v>

3017
01:26:43.781 --> 01:26:44.710
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you that right now.</v>

3018
01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:48.040
<v Speaker 3>I think that's more ridiculous because men's rights,</v>

3019
01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:53.280
<v Speaker 3>I think the only time it's valid at all is involving divorce and children.</v>

3020
01:26:53.530 --> 01:26:53.861
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

3021
01:26:53.861 --> 01:26:54.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3022
01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:55.210
<v Speaker 3>Divorce and custody.</v>

3023
01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:56.590
<v Speaker 3>Women's rights,</v>

3024
01:26:56.890 --> 01:26:59.230
<v Speaker 3>like women are way more,</v>

3025
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:02.170
<v Speaker 3>way more diminished by society.</v>

3026
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:06.070
<v Speaker 3>Way more marginalized by culture than men are.</v>

3027
01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:08.440
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you have a men's rights association,</v>

3028
01:27:08.441 --> 01:27:11.570
<v Speaker 3>like really like how much more do you need to control?</v>

3029
01:27:11.571 --> 01:27:13.630
<v Speaker 3>Like men make way more money.</v>

3030
01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:14.020
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

3031
01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:14.390
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3032
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:16.420
<v Speaker 3>they're in the positions of power,</v>

3033
01:27:16.421 --> 01:27:17.800
<v Speaker 3>like as far as like government,</v>

3034
01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:22.360
<v Speaker 3>they're way more represented when it comes to like ceos when it comes to like</v>

3035
01:27:22.630 --> 01:27:23.441
<v Speaker 3>head of industry.</v>

3036
01:27:23.441 --> 01:27:26.710
<v Speaker 3>They're way more represented like men's rights really.</v>

3037
01:27:26.711 --> 01:27:27.270
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

3038
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.500
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3039
01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.660
<v Speaker 3>what rights are we missing?</v>

3040
01:27:28.690 --> 01:27:30.640
<v Speaker 3>The only ones there like divorce loss,</v>

3041
01:27:30.641 --> 01:27:31.450
<v Speaker 3>but I mean that's it.</v>

3042
01:27:31.450 --> 01:27:32.270
<v Speaker 4>That's an example,</v>

3043
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:34.850
<v Speaker 4>a perfect example of the extremes of both sides,</v>

3044
01:27:34.851 --> 01:27:35.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3045
01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:39.720
<v Speaker 4>Because it's something that comes from a really valid discussion from,</v>

3046
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:40.830
<v Speaker 4>from like I,</v>

3047
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:42.500
<v Speaker 4>it's not like when I say feminist,</v>

3048
01:27:42.501 --> 01:27:44.540
<v Speaker 4>I think of people that talk about equality,</v>

3049
01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:46.220
<v Speaker 4>but then there's this whole other level,</v>

3050
01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:46.570
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3051
01:27:46.570 --> 01:27:48.110
<v Speaker 4>That goes almost into,</v>

3052
01:27:48.111 --> 01:27:53.111
<v Speaker 4>into hating and attacking a giant group rather than the bad parts of men are the</v>

3053
01:27:55.401 --> 01:27:59.570
<v Speaker 4>bad groups of men and so then he just have all these people in the middle going,</v>

3054
01:27:59.600 --> 01:27:59.811
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

3055
01:27:59.811 --> 01:28:00.570
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

3056
01:28:00.570 --> 01:28:00.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3057
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:03.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to talk.</v>

3058
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3059
01:28:03.501 --> 01:28:04.191
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>

3060
01:28:04.191 --> 01:28:05.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you don't want to be.</v>

3061
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:08.060
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know what an MRA was.</v>

3062
01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.510
<v Speaker 3>Somebody called me an Mra on twitter.</v>

3063
01:28:10.511 --> 01:28:10.671
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3064
01:28:10.671 --> 01:28:11.121
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

3065
01:28:11.121 --> 01:28:13.040
<v Speaker 3>Was that a meal replacement or something like that.</v>

3066
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:14.540
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what an MRI was,</v>

3067
01:28:14.541 --> 01:28:16.950
<v Speaker 3>so I had to google it and I'm like men's,</v>

3068
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:18.500
<v Speaker 3>but then I thought about it like,</v>

3069
01:28:18.501 --> 01:28:18.891
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

3070
01:28:18.891 --> 01:28:21.290
<v Speaker 3>a men's rights advocate as a bad thing.</v>

3071
01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:25.100
<v Speaker 3>Like someone who is a feminist was mocking me for being an Mra and I'm like,</v>

3072
01:28:25.150 --> 01:28:25.380
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3073
01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:26.870
<v Speaker 3>that seems kind of fucked.</v>

3074
01:28:27.170 --> 01:28:28.500
<v Speaker 3>Like you're you.</v>

3075
01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:32.930
<v Speaker 3>You were specifically identifying on your twitter handle.</v>

3076
01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:34.460
<v Speaker 3>You look at their page,</v>

3077
01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:35.331
<v Speaker 3>feminist,</v>

3078
01:28:35.331 --> 01:28:36.320
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag feminist.</v>

3079
01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:41.450
<v Speaker 3>You are identifying with support for the female gender,</v>

3080
01:28:41.570 --> 01:28:46.190
<v Speaker 3>but you're mocking someone by using this as a pejorative,</v>

3081
01:28:46.191 --> 01:28:51.191
<v Speaker 3>like using men's rights advocate as a negative statement.</v>

3082
01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:51.650
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3083
01:28:51.650 --> 01:28:52.990
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of hilarious thing.</v>

3084
01:28:52.991 --> 01:28:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Seems quite hypocritical.</v>

3085
01:28:54.170 --> 01:28:55.550
<v Speaker 4>The thing you have to be scared of though,</v>

3086
01:28:55.551 --> 01:28:55.791
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3087
01:28:55.791 --> 01:28:59.690
<v Speaker 4>There are so many just troll accounts that are meant to stir up the conversation</v>

3088
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:03.820
<v Speaker 4>and like that's when I'm like reporting on stuff and I'm taking stuff from,</v>

3089
01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.130
<v Speaker 4>from the Internet and twitter.</v>

3090
01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:09.900
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to tell because some of the people that are crazy,</v>

3091
01:29:09.901 --> 01:29:10.261
<v Speaker 4>crazy,</v>

3092
01:29:10.261 --> 01:29:12.600
<v Speaker 4>silly people say the same stuff as the trolls.</v>

3093
01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:13.973
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3094
01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:14.843
<v Speaker 4>Are you being serious?</v>

3095
01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:15.381
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3096
01:29:15.381 --> 01:29:15.951
<v Speaker 3>it's also.</v>

3097
01:29:15.951 --> 01:29:18.500
<v Speaker 3>It's funny because a lot of people that do it,</v>

3098
01:29:18.501 --> 01:29:22.910
<v Speaker 3>they do it just to get everybody freaked out and then people who are like</v>

3099
01:29:22.911 --> 01:29:23.840
<v Speaker 3>serious about it,</v>

3100
01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:26.540
<v Speaker 3>start taking them and using them as an example.</v>

3101
01:29:26.541 --> 01:29:26.870
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

3102
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:27.171
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3103
01:29:27.171 --> 01:29:28.004
<v Speaker 3>he's right and like,</v>

3104
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.281
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3105
01:29:28.281 --> 01:29:28.461
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3106
01:29:28.461 --> 01:29:29.300
<v Speaker 3>and we're not right.</v>

3107
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:30.560
<v Speaker 3>We're fucking around here.</v>

3108
01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of people online that are trolls,</v>

3109
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:38.810
<v Speaker 3>meaning that they literally are just for sport,</v>

3110
01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.570
<v Speaker 3>trying to rile folks up there just for sport.</v>

3111
01:29:41.571 --> 01:29:45.110
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to push buttons and get people route and that's another new</v>

3112
01:29:45.111 --> 01:29:47.510
<v Speaker 3>reality that we're faced with with the Internet,</v>

3113
01:29:47.511 --> 01:29:49.010
<v Speaker 3>like youtube comments,</v>

3114
01:29:49.610 --> 01:29:54.610
<v Speaker 3>how youtube comments are just literally designed to fuck with Philip DEFRANCO's</v>

3115
01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:55.070
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

3116
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.491
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

3117
01:29:55.491 --> 01:29:57.590
<v Speaker 3>How many times I've seen your comments.</v>

3118
01:29:57.630 --> 01:29:58.463
<v Speaker 4>I've had to go.</v>

3119
01:29:58.850 --> 01:30:01.170
<v Speaker 4>I think I made something this week where I was just like,</v>

3120
01:30:01.171 --> 01:30:05.310
<v Speaker 4>I know that 80 percent of the people that watch this do not leave comments or</v>

3121
01:30:05.311 --> 01:30:05.850
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

3122
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:09.000
<v Speaker 4>Just say what's up because everyone assumes the community is all awesome.</v>

3123
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:12.780
<v Speaker 4>Twenty percent suck like 20 percent of the worst people in the world and all it</v>

3124
01:30:12.781 --> 01:30:14.340
<v Speaker 4>takes is 200.</v>

3125
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:17.040
<v Speaker 4>Have some people that agree with something and some people that just want to</v>

3126
01:30:17.041 --> 01:30:20.370
<v Speaker 4>fuck with me to get like that stupid ass comment on the front,</v>

3127
01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:21.241
<v Speaker 4>on the front page,</v>

3128
01:30:21.241 --> 01:30:23.420
<v Speaker 4>at the top comment and I just see it and I'm like I don't,</v>

3129
01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:27.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do this anymore because I fucking hate you.</v>

3130
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:28.680
<v Speaker 4>I hate you so much.</v>

3131
01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:32.240
<v Speaker 4>And then and then and then people that don't know it's,</v>

3132
01:30:32.241 --> 01:30:32.850
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

3133
01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:36.060
<v Speaker 4>But at the end of the day you realize that it doesn't fucking matter at all,</v>

3134
01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:40.140
<v Speaker 3>but it's amazing that a very small number like say if your videos,</v>

3135
01:30:40.170 --> 01:30:42.330
<v Speaker 3>like some of your videos have like more than a million hits,</v>

3136
01:30:42.530 --> 01:30:42.681
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3137
01:30:42.681 --> 01:30:42.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3138
01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:43.200
<v Speaker 4>Some,</v>

3139
01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.560
<v Speaker 4>I think these days that they average around half a mil.</v>

3140
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:46.041
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3141
01:30:46.041 --> 01:30:46.801
<v Speaker 4>So think about that.</v>

3142
01:30:46.801 --> 01:30:47.634
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>

3143
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:49.730
<v Speaker 3>Hundred thousand fucking hits.</v>

3144
01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:52.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many people that is because I'm sure some of them watch it more</v>

3145
01:30:52.911 --> 01:30:53.400
<v Speaker 3>than once,</v>

3146
01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:56.300
<v Speaker 3>but let's say it's 300,000 people.</v>

3147
01:30:56.540 --> 01:31:01.540
<v Speaker 3>All it takes is 10 unbelievable Douche bags to get on that comment section and</v>

3148
01:31:01.911 --> 01:31:02.900
<v Speaker 3>just start pounding.</v>

3149
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.700
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

3150
01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:04.533
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3151
01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.870
<v Speaker 4>Nah.</v>

3152
01:31:06.110 --> 01:31:08.090
<v Speaker 4>And then you have this fuck fest,</v>

3153
01:31:08.091 --> 01:31:10.310
<v Speaker 4>this clusterfuck in your comments.</v>

3154
01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:10.711
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3155
01:31:10.711 --> 01:31:13.790
<v Speaker 4>It's the best is when there are political statements on videos that shouldn't,</v>

3156
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.330
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3157
01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:15.140
<v Speaker 4>like it's like,</v>

3158
01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:15.973
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3159
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:16.731
<v Speaker 4>what was it the,</v>

3160
01:31:16.731 --> 01:31:17.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3161
01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:19.640
<v Speaker 4>the one where they were dumping water on it with the ASL challenge,</v>

3162
01:31:19.730 --> 01:31:20.330
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3163
01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:23.600
<v Speaker 4>Just like you would look and then it would be like some huge commentary about</v>

3164
01:31:23.601 --> 01:31:25.670
<v Speaker 4>how Obama was a communist and you're just like,</v>

3165
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:29.570
<v Speaker 4>why do I hope that was like a copy paste and you didn't see this video and</v>

3166
01:31:29.571 --> 01:31:29.871
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

3167
01:31:29.871 --> 01:31:33.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm inspired and just start fucking type in Obama's.</v>

3168
01:31:33.411 --> 01:31:33.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3169
01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:34.130
<v Speaker 3>communism,</v>

3170
01:31:34.130 --> 01:31:37.910
<v Speaker 3>Marxism moments in those terms that people love to toss around.</v>

3171
01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:39.423
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3172
01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:40.353
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

3173
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.690
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

3174
01:31:40.690 --> 01:31:44.450
<v Speaker 3>we live in amazing times in so many ways,</v>

3175
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:45.700
<v Speaker 3>but also the,</v>

3176
01:31:45.730 --> 01:31:47.360
<v Speaker 3>the ability to reach people.</v>

3177
01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:48.650
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>

3178
01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:48.870
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3179
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:49.051
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3180
01:31:49.051 --> 01:31:49.884
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3181
01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:52.220
<v Speaker 3>it's so everyone is so accessible.</v>

3182
01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:52.730
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3183
01:31:52.730 --> 01:31:57.730
<v Speaker 3>it's magical in a way that it's exposing all these weird aspects,</v>

3184
01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:02.530
<v Speaker 3>human interaction and human behavior in a way that's never happened before</v>

3185
01:32:02.531 --> 01:32:04.480
<v Speaker 3>because you're not actually talking to someone,</v>

3186
01:32:04.481 --> 01:32:05.314
<v Speaker 3>you're not in front of them.</v>

3187
01:32:05.410 --> 01:32:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Like if you said something and someone responded to it and said,</v>

3188
01:32:08.591 --> 01:32:08.861
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3189
01:32:08.861 --> 01:32:09.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3190
01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:11.050
<v Speaker 3>I think that's offensive and you'd be like,</v>

3191
01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:12.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really Siri.</v>

3192
01:32:12.291 --> 01:32:13.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of fucking around,</v>

3193
01:32:13.421 --> 01:32:14.254
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3194
01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:16.000
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>

3195
01:32:16.210 --> 01:32:16.810
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

3196
01:32:16.810 --> 01:32:19.390
<v Speaker 3>Like you could see like if somebody's really meant it,</v>

3197
01:32:19.391 --> 01:32:19.541
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3198
01:32:19.541 --> 01:32:20.470
<v Speaker 3>that would be offensive,</v>

3199
01:32:20.471 --> 01:32:21.304
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3200
01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:24.880
<v Speaker 3>the way to be funny is to actually goofed around and then you would have a</v>

3201
01:32:24.881 --> 01:32:28.030
<v Speaker 3>conversation with them and you probably come to some sort of an understanding,</v>

3202
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:29.350
<v Speaker 3>but that's what people do.</v>

3203
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.860
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

3204
01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:30.641
<v Speaker 3>you say something,</v>

3205
01:32:30.641 --> 01:32:31.421
<v Speaker 3>I say something,</v>

3206
01:32:31.421 --> 01:32:33.640
<v Speaker 3>but when someone wants to write something about you,</v>

3207
01:32:33.641 --> 01:32:35.830
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a tumbler blog or something along those lines,</v>

3208
01:32:36.190 --> 01:32:37.810
<v Speaker 3>they're not interacting with you.</v>

3209
01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:39.370
<v Speaker 3>They're just spewing,</v>

3210
01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:40.840
<v Speaker 3>you know all around.</v>

3211
01:32:40.841 --> 01:32:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3212
01:32:41.130 --> 01:32:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3213
01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:42.101
<v Speaker 3>And they're,</v>

3214
01:32:42.101 --> 01:32:45.790
<v Speaker 3>they're spewing out these words and they're having this reaction where that</v>

3215
01:32:45.791 --> 01:32:50.050
<v Speaker 3>would be a completely different reaction if they actually talk to you.</v>

3216
01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:51.071
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3217
01:32:51.071 --> 01:32:55.450
<v Speaker 3>and in that way it's an unbelievably ineffective way of communicating.</v>

3218
01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:58.660
<v Speaker 3>It's very self indulgent like to,</v>

3219
01:32:58.680 --> 01:32:58.851
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

3220
01:32:58.851 --> 01:33:02.350
<v Speaker 3>to go off on Tumbler rants or twitter rants.</v>

3221
01:33:02.351 --> 01:33:03.940
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a very self indulgent in that way.</v>

3222
01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:04.831
<v Speaker 4>Oh definitely.</v>

3223
01:33:04.831 --> 01:33:07.020
<v Speaker 4>But whenever I look at that or anything in life,</v>

3224
01:33:07.021 --> 01:33:10.020
<v Speaker 4>I kind of wonder like does the good outweigh the bad?</v>

3225
01:33:10.021 --> 01:33:11.160
<v Speaker 4>And I think 100 percent it does,</v>

3226
01:33:11.230 --> 01:33:12.900
<v Speaker 4>like there's way more good.</v>

3227
01:33:13.090 --> 01:33:13.601
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3228
01:33:13.601 --> 01:33:14.434
<v Speaker 3>Most certainly.</v>

3229
01:33:14.630 --> 01:33:14.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3230
01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean the band is kind of funny,</v>

3231
01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:18.070
<v Speaker 3>you know there's,</v>

3232
01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:20.920
<v Speaker 3>there's certainly bad in terms of harassment,</v>

3233
01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:23.140
<v Speaker 3>harassment aspect is this,</v>

3234
01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:26.470
<v Speaker 3>that's the creepiest scariest because</v>

3235
01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:32.830
<v Speaker 3>especially when it comes to some of the evil fucking violent death threats and</v>

3236
01:33:32.831 --> 01:33:37.240
<v Speaker 3>shit that some people and almost most of it teams to go towards women and it's</v>

3237
01:33:37.241 --> 01:33:38.050
<v Speaker 3>just these,</v>

3238
01:33:38.050 --> 01:33:40.660
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of men out there that are just not,</v>

3239
01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:44.200
<v Speaker 3>they're not deemed attractive to women.</v>

3240
01:33:44.201 --> 01:33:45.300
<v Speaker 3>They're not there,</v>

3241
01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:49.480
<v Speaker 3>they're not desirable by women and they've lived their life in this really</v>

3242
01:33:49.481 --> 01:33:51.220
<v Speaker 3>resentful state.</v>

3243
01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.410
<v Speaker 3>This like this painful state.</v>

3244
01:33:53.411 --> 01:33:57.130
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're a guy and you're going through life and you're constantly being</v>

3245
01:33:57.131 --> 01:34:00.580
<v Speaker 3>rejected and you're looking at some high school jock,</v>

3246
01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:01.960
<v Speaker 3>quarterback type dude,</v>

3247
01:34:01.961 --> 01:34:04.930
<v Speaker 3>it gets all the girls and you just fucking fuming inside.</v>

3248
01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:07.510
<v Speaker 3>You're angry and and you,</v>

3249
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:08.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3250
01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:12.910
<v Speaker 3>you live your life like this and then you have this outlet of expressing</v>

3251
01:34:12.911 --> 01:34:16.240
<v Speaker 3>yourself and then you see some woman and for whatever reason you've developed</v>

3252
01:34:16.241 --> 01:34:16.630
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

3253
01:34:16.630 --> 01:34:21.520
<v Speaker 3>I know guys because of the fact that they've been rejected by women for so long.</v>

3254
01:34:21.730 --> 01:34:26.730
<v Speaker 3>They associate women with pain because they associate women with rejecting them</v>

3255
01:34:27.281 --> 01:34:31.960
<v Speaker 3>or with hating them and they get angry and they lash out.</v>

3256
01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:32.501
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3257
01:34:32.501 --> 01:34:33.334
<v Speaker 3>they want,</v>

3258
01:34:33.370 --> 01:34:38.110
<v Speaker 3>they want that woman to feel a part of what they felt their whole life.</v>

3259
01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:38.690
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

3260
01:34:38.690 --> 01:34:38.931
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

3261
01:34:38.931 --> 01:34:40.520
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking terrifying.</v>

3262
01:34:40.521 --> 01:34:40.940
<v Speaker 4>There was,</v>

3263
01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:41.630
<v Speaker 4>there was that,</v>

3264
01:34:41.630 --> 01:34:45.080
<v Speaker 4>there was that kid that shot up all those people at that,</v>

3265
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:46.520
<v Speaker 4>a college party.</v>

3266
01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:49.520
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like earlier in the year or late last year,</v>

3267
01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:50.420
<v Speaker 4>and he had the,</v>

3268
01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:53.510
<v Speaker 4>like the youtube video is where he was talking about he was going to make women</v>

3269
01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:55.790
<v Speaker 4>pay Santa Barbara,</v>

3270
01:34:55.791 --> 01:34:56.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3271
01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:56.361
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3272
01:34:56.361 --> 01:34:57.800
<v Speaker 4>The number of that</v>

3273
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:58.873
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

3274
01:34:59.000 --> 01:34:59.241
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3275
01:34:59.241 --> 01:35:00.074
<v Speaker 1>it's women's fault.</v>

3276
01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:01.520
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>

3277
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:02.301
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

3278
01:35:02.301 --> 01:35:02.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3279
01:35:02.451 --> 01:35:05.750
<v Speaker 1>that's the men's rights guys in the pickup artist guys,</v>

3280
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:09.560
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of these pickup artists guys were saying like,</v>

3281
01:35:09.561 --> 01:35:14.240
<v Speaker 1>if these women weren't so stuck up and if they weren't so prudish,</v>

3282
01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:16.790
<v Speaker 1>like this guy would have gotten laid and this would've never happened.</v>

3283
01:35:16.791 --> 01:35:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Like that's crazy.</v>

3284
01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:19.153
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3285
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:22.010
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with a mental health issue for sure.</v>

3286
01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:23.000
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

3287
01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Like to blame this in some way on,</v>

3288
01:35:26.190 --> 01:35:26.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3289
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:29.150
<v Speaker 1>that this could have been cured with promiscuity.</v>

3290
01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Fucking bizarre.</v>

3291
01:35:30.561 --> 01:35:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Like that level of victim blaming.</v>

3292
01:35:32.061 --> 01:35:33.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what blows my mind.</v>

3293
01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3294
01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:34.730
<v Speaker 1>That blows my mind.</v>

3295
01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:35.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3296
01:35:35.241 --> 01:35:36.380
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking crazy.</v>

3297
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:37.100
<v Speaker 1>That's just.</v>

3298
01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:39.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just insane.</v>

3299
01:35:39.561 --> 01:35:40.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's also,</v>

3300
01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:44.750
<v Speaker 1>that's also like being around too many likeminded psychos.</v>

3301
01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Like there's those groups they get together and they,</v>

3302
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:52.970
<v Speaker 1>they like sort of like reaffirm each other's ridiculous notions and then they</v>

3303
01:35:52.971 --> 01:35:55.610
<v Speaker 1>feed off of each other and then they start attacking,</v>

3304
01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:56.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3305
01:35:56.241 --> 01:35:59.780
<v Speaker 1>and then they start making those little egg fake twitter councils toss away</v>

3306
01:35:59.781 --> 01:36:02.420
<v Speaker 1>accounts and just talking mad shit to people.</v>

3307
01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3308
01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:04.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3309
01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:06.110
<v Speaker 1>I think in the future you're not gonna be able to do that.</v>

3310
01:36:06.111 --> 01:36:08.870
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things that's a problem with things like twitter is that you</v>

3311
01:36:08.871 --> 01:36:10.070
<v Speaker 1>can be anonymous,</v>

3312
01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:10.760
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3313
01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that being anonymous is completely bad?</v>

3314
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:15.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3315
01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:17.240
<v Speaker 1>because I mean because I think it's gray.</v>

3316
01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:17.641
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3317
01:36:17.641 --> 01:36:17.731
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3318
01:36:17.731 --> 01:36:18.441
<v Speaker 1>I think it is great.</v>

3319
01:36:18.441 --> 01:36:18.711
<v Speaker 1>Rather,</v>

3320
01:36:18.711 --> 01:36:19.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's black and white.</v>

3321
01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:20.721
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>

3322
01:36:20.721 --> 01:36:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I think you can express yourself in an anonymous way honestly.</v>

3323
01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if it was your own name,</v>

3324
01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:31.160
<v Speaker 1>like if you wanted a tweet something about a movie and you're like,</v>

3325
01:36:31.161 --> 01:36:31.401
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3326
01:36:31.401 --> 01:36:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't want these people to be mad at me,</v>

3327
01:36:33.021 --> 01:36:37.370
<v Speaker 1>but this was the most fucking pedestrian piece of shit film I've ever seen in my</v>

3328
01:36:37.371 --> 01:36:37.521
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

3329
01:36:37.521 --> 01:36:38.354
<v Speaker 1>Holy fucking.</v>

3330
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:39.980
<v Speaker 1>How did this guy ever get a job?</v>

3331
01:36:39.981 --> 01:36:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Who fucking wrote this?</v>

3332
01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:41.930
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

3333
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:42.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that.</v>

3334
01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:43.970
<v Speaker 1>But that's how you really feel.</v>

3335
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3336
01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:44.960
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

3337
01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:45.621
<v Speaker 1>But that's the thing,</v>

3338
01:36:45.621 --> 01:36:45.831
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3339
01:36:45.831 --> 01:36:46.551
<v Speaker 1>So being anonymous,</v>

3340
01:36:46.551 --> 01:36:47.660
<v Speaker 1>you can go and you can go,</v>

3341
01:36:47.661 --> 01:36:48.321
<v Speaker 1>hey joe Rogan,</v>

3342
01:36:48.321 --> 01:36:49.040
<v Speaker 1>fuck yourself.</v>

3343
01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:50.390
<v Speaker 1>But you can also,</v>

3344
01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:51.373
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3345
01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:53.060
<v Speaker 1>get the word out slash criticized.</v>

3346
01:36:53.061 --> 01:36:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Maybe like a really bad professor.</v>

3347
01:36:54.471 --> 01:36:54.851
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

3348
01:36:54.851 --> 01:36:55.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3349
01:36:55.160 --> 01:37:00.160
<v Speaker 1>you can get something out about someone without the real life ramifications if</v>

3350
01:37:00.291 --> 01:37:00.650
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3351
01:37:00.650 --> 01:37:01.850
<v Speaker 1>if you did something else.</v>

3352
01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:02.660
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>

3353
01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:05.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of those things where I think that being an honest on the</v>

3354
01:37:05.481 --> 01:37:07.310
<v Speaker 1>internet overall,</v>

3355
01:37:07.311 --> 01:37:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I think the good outweighs the bad at this point.</v>

3356
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3357
01:37:10.670 --> 01:37:10.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3358
01:37:10.941 --> 01:37:12.320
<v Speaker 1>I think the good outweighs the bad as well.</v>

3359
01:37:12.321 --> 01:37:13.910
<v Speaker 1>I think essentially,</v>

3360
01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:15.830
<v Speaker 1>like I said about youtube comments,</v>

3361
01:37:15.831 --> 01:37:20.831
<v Speaker 1>like you could have 10 people in 500,000 that attack your comments section and</v>

3362
01:37:21.111 --> 01:37:22.910
<v Speaker 1>ruin the whole fucking thing easily,</v>

3363
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3364
01:37:23.511 --> 01:37:28.010
<v Speaker 1>especially if they continue to post and continue to do it and that's,</v>

3365
01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:28.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3366
01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:32.340
<v Speaker 1>overall 500,000 people are watching it or whatever and you know,</v>

3367
01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:33.650
<v Speaker 1>10 get upset,</v>

3368
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:34.880
<v Speaker 1>it balances out.</v>

3369
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:37.880
<v Speaker 1>The information is not changing.</v>

3370
01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Your video is not changing,</v>

3371
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3372
01:37:40.461 --> 01:37:44.840
<v Speaker 1>and if you get a certain amount of negative responses on twitter or a certain</v>

3373
01:37:44.841 --> 01:37:48.500
<v Speaker 1>amount of people that get angry at you,</v>

3374
01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:50.240
<v Speaker 1>ultimately the,</v>

3375
01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:55.230
<v Speaker 1>the unique ability to express herself that we experienced today is way more</v>

3376
01:37:55.231 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 1>positive than</v>

3377
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:56.963
<v Speaker 4>it is negative.</v>

3378
01:37:57.090 --> 01:37:57.421
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

3379
01:37:57.421 --> 01:37:57.841
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>

3380
01:37:57.841 --> 01:37:58.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3381
01:37:58.650 --> 01:38:02.610
<v Speaker 4>over the course of doing the show because there's so much valid conversation and</v>

3382
01:38:02.730 --> 01:38:04.470
<v Speaker 4>we also banned the hell out of trolls.</v>

3383
01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:05.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3384
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:06.331
<v Speaker 4>we've had,</v>

3385
01:38:06.331 --> 01:38:09.030
<v Speaker 4>I feel like good conversations about capital punishment,</v>

3386
01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:09.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3387
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:13.020
<v Speaker 4>like my opinion has constantly changed on whether we should have that.</v>

3388
01:38:13.050 --> 01:38:14.220
<v Speaker 4>Like that should be a thing.</v>

3389
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:17.700
<v Speaker 4>And I mean we talked about it on the show today.</v>

3390
01:38:17.701 --> 01:38:18.421
<v Speaker 4>That was the other one.</v>

3391
01:38:18.421 --> 01:38:18.781
<v Speaker 4>The uh,</v>

3392
01:38:18.781 --> 01:38:23.760
<v Speaker 4>there's a 14 year old kid are like 70 years ago he was convicted of murder in</v>

3393
01:38:23.761 --> 01:38:25.690
<v Speaker 4>South Carolina and they killed him like he was,</v>

3394
01:38:25.850 --> 01:38:26.880
<v Speaker 4>he was a 14 year old boy.</v>

3395
01:38:26.881 --> 01:38:28.110
<v Speaker 4>Had to put them on a,</v>

3396
01:38:28.111 --> 01:38:28.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3397
01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:30.420
<v Speaker 4>on a phone book so they could electrocute him.</v>

3398
01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:31.733
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3399
01:38:31.770 --> 01:38:33.210
<v Speaker 4>and then you look at the numbers.</v>

3400
01:38:33.211 --> 01:38:33.651
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

3401
01:38:33.651 --> 01:38:34.020
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>

3402
01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:35.390
<v Speaker 4>we killed the,</v>

3403
01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:38.820
<v Speaker 4>the smallest number of people in 20 years.</v>

3404
01:38:38.821 --> 01:38:42.210
<v Speaker 4>We sentenced the smallest number of people to death this year.</v>

3405
01:38:42.570 --> 01:38:43.080
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3406
01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:43.561
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know,</v>

3407
01:38:43.561 --> 01:38:43.930
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3408
01:38:43.930 --> 01:38:46.440
<v Speaker 4>it's a good conversation most of the time.</v>

3409
01:38:47.150 --> 01:38:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3410
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:48.470
<v Speaker 3>As a father,</v>

3411
01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:50.220
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that you realize,</v>

3412
01:38:51.070 --> 01:38:56.070
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's happened to me is that I've become way more kind and</v>

3413
01:38:56.570 --> 01:39:01.450
<v Speaker 3>way more forgiving of people's circumstances and behavior because I,</v>

3414
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.931
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

3415
01:39:02.931 --> 01:39:04.370
<v Speaker 3>I really Sam Harris,</v>

3416
01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:09.400
<v Speaker 3>who was on the podcast and he started talking to me about determinism and he was</v>

3417
01:39:09.471 --> 01:39:14.050
<v Speaker 3>talking about the idea of free will and determinism determinism,</v>

3418
01:39:14.090 --> 01:39:16.130
<v Speaker 3>the idea of your life experiences,</v>

3419
01:39:16.131 --> 01:39:16.964
<v Speaker 3>your genetics,</v>

3420
01:39:17.090 --> 01:39:19.700
<v Speaker 3>everything that you've gone through in your life is essentially what makes</v>

3421
01:39:19.701 --> 01:39:22.240
<v Speaker 3>Philip to Franco in 2014 on December.</v>

3422
01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:23.270
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck the day is.</v>

3423
01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:24.510
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean like that.</v>

3424
01:39:24.710 --> 01:39:27.560
<v Speaker 3>That is who you are and you.</v>

3425
01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:32.800
<v Speaker 3>This idea of free will becomes very cloudy because essentially you are this huge</v>

3426
01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:40.220
<v Speaker 3>accumulation of experiences and genetics and all these different things.</v>

3427
01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:40.911
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3428
01:39:40.911 --> 01:39:41.990
<v Speaker 3>when you become a parent,</v>

3429
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:44.510
<v Speaker 3>at least I've the way I've experienced,</v>

3430
01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:46.820
<v Speaker 3>I look at people very differently now because I don't look,</v>

3431
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.950
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3432
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:48.230
<v Speaker 3>there's that guy is a fuck up.</v>

3433
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.651
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3434
01:39:48.651 --> 01:39:49.520
<v Speaker 3>this guy's a loser.</v>

3435
01:39:49.730 --> 01:39:50.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't look at it that way.</v>

3436
01:39:50.811 --> 01:39:53.450
<v Speaker 3>I look at it like that was a baby.</v>

3437
01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:54.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3438
01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:58.310
<v Speaker 3>That was a baby that was raised in some probably unbelievably abusive</v>

3439
01:39:58.311 --> 01:40:03.070
<v Speaker 3>environment and they became this complete fucking idiot and 30,</v>

3440
01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:03.560
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3441
01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:03.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3442
01:40:03.891 --> 01:40:08.891
<v Speaker 3>and most likely a large majority of how they became that person is not because</v>

3443
01:40:10.461 --> 01:40:11.510
<v Speaker 3>of their own actions.</v>

3444
01:40:11.511 --> 01:40:15.060
<v Speaker 3>It's because of the way they were raised and because of the circumstances that</v>

3445
01:40:15.061 --> 01:40:17.270
<v Speaker 3>they found themselves in just completely by chance.</v>

3446
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:20.960
<v Speaker 3>And I look at serial killers that way.</v>

3447
01:40:20.961 --> 01:40:22.040
<v Speaker 3>Now I look at,</v>

3448
01:40:22.370 --> 01:40:23.203
<v Speaker 3>I look at,</v>

3449
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:24.103
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3450
01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:25.790
<v Speaker 3>negative people,</v>

3451
01:40:25.791 --> 01:40:27.650
<v Speaker 3>male and female in that way.</v>

3452
01:40:27.651 --> 01:40:32.651
<v Speaker 3>I just think a lot of what we're dealing with in our culture is people that</v>

3453
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:33.260
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3454
01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:37.580
<v Speaker 3>they've been raised in an insanely shitty way by people didn't know what the</v>

3455
01:40:37.581 --> 01:40:38.420
<v Speaker 3>fuck they were doing.</v>

3456
01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:40.430
<v Speaker 3>They've had a bunch of horrible things happen to them.</v>

3457
01:40:40.431 --> 01:40:43.400
<v Speaker 3>They had bad circumstances and this is the result of that.</v>

3458
01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:45.020
<v Speaker 4>But at what point do you just,</v>

3459
01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:45.800
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

3460
01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:49.010
<v Speaker 4>is that a cop out and you don't hold people accountable for their actions?</v>

3461
01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:51.230
<v Speaker 4>That's the big question there was,</v>

3462
01:40:51.231 --> 01:40:52.064
<v Speaker 4>there was the,</v>

3463
01:40:52.230 --> 01:40:53.580
<v Speaker 4>the young was like,</v>

3464
01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:55.450
<v Speaker 4>I feel like he was 16 from a really,</v>

3465
01:40:55.451 --> 01:40:56.890
<v Speaker 4>really rich family in Texas.</v>

3466
01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:57.993
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3467
01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:00.430
<v Speaker 4>he and a bunch of guys that were under age,</v>

3468
01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:01.510
<v Speaker 4>they got,</v>

3469
01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:03.640
<v Speaker 4>they took a dad's car and got really,</v>

3470
01:41:03.641 --> 01:41:04.151
<v Speaker 4>really drunk,</v>

3471
01:41:04.151 --> 01:41:04.960
<v Speaker 4>drove a,</v>

3472
01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:07.360
<v Speaker 4>ended up killing a bunch of people and he ended up,</v>

3473
01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:12.361
<v Speaker 4>I think not doing any time in jail because they argued that because he was from</v>

3474
01:41:12.581 --> 01:41:13.600
<v Speaker 4>a rich family,</v>

3475
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:14.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3476
01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:14.890
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3477
01:41:14.890 --> 01:41:18.100
<v Speaker 4>that he didn't understand consequences for actions.</v>

3478
01:41:18.370 --> 01:41:19.000
<v Speaker 4>Like that's,</v>

3479
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:19.930
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

3480
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.780
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3481
01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:22.750
<v Speaker 4>I think you have to.</v>

3482
01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:24.850
<v Speaker 4>What's the point of rules?</v>

3483
01:41:24.851 --> 01:41:25.684
<v Speaker 4>If we go,</v>

3484
01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:29.110
<v Speaker 4>he's had too easy of a life or he's had too hard of a life.</v>

3485
01:41:29.410 --> 01:41:31.030
<v Speaker 4>I think that you can make changes.</v>

3486
01:41:31.031 --> 01:41:34.030
<v Speaker 4>Like don't don't put people that smoke weed in prison.</v>

3487
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:35.070
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

3488
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:36.850
<v Speaker 4>but what about these violent criminals?</v>

3489
01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:41.870
<v Speaker 3>There's also a problem in that when human beings get to a certain point,</v>

3490
01:41:42.050 --> 01:41:44.120
<v Speaker 3>is there a way you can fix them?</v>

3491
01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:44.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3492
01:41:44.850 --> 01:41:48.080
<v Speaker 3>like a guy like a Ted Bundy,</v>

3493
01:41:48.230 --> 01:41:48.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3494
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:49.610
<v Speaker 3>You can't fix that guy.</v>

3495
01:41:49.611 --> 01:41:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Like when they reach a certain point,</v>

3496
01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:53.690
<v Speaker 3>like you have to remove them from society.</v>

3497
01:41:53.691 --> 01:41:54.350
<v Speaker 3>You got to kill him.</v>

3498
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:56.630
<v Speaker 3>He's deriving pleasure at a killing women.</v>

3499
01:41:56.631 --> 01:41:57.650
<v Speaker 3>What are we going to fix him?</v>

3500
01:41:57.651 --> 01:42:00.650
<v Speaker 3>And then trust that we can release them out in the public and he's not going to</v>

3501
01:42:00.651 --> 01:42:02.180
<v Speaker 3>go kill a bunch of more women.</v>

3502
01:42:02.181 --> 01:42:02.391
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3503
01:42:02.391 --> 01:42:02.931
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

3504
01:42:02.931 --> 01:42:03.764
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

3505
01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:08.800
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain point of no return where human beings reach and it always that</v>

3506
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:13.420
<v Speaker 3>that point of no return always involves victimizing other people as soon as the</v>

3507
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:16.640
<v Speaker 3>they hurt people or kill.</v>

3508
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3509
01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:19.820
<v Speaker 3>Without death or violence.</v>

3510
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.990
<v Speaker 3>Bernie maydoff,</v>

3511
01:42:21.050 --> 01:42:21.830
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3512
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:23.750
<v Speaker 3>how much money can you steal?</v>

3513
01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:25.700
<v Speaker 3>How many lives can you ruin?</v>

3514
01:42:25.730 --> 01:42:28.160
<v Speaker 3>How many financial futures can you destroy?</v>

3515
01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:32.180
<v Speaker 3>And we still let you go back into society and be a free person.</v>

3516
01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:33.071
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3517
01:42:33.071 --> 01:42:34.630
<v Speaker 4>there is also the question of in America,</v>

3518
01:42:34.631 --> 01:42:37.750
<v Speaker 4>I think the thought of rehabilitation is not there,</v>

3519
01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:38.980
<v Speaker 4>at least with our prison systems.</v>

3520
01:42:38.981 --> 01:42:40.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's because it's,</v>

3521
01:42:40.081 --> 01:42:44.800
<v Speaker 4>it's a moneymaker or it's just we just want what we consider monsters away from</v>

3522
01:42:44.801 --> 01:42:45.150
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>

3523
01:42:45.150 --> 01:42:46.670
<v Speaker 3>but don't really rehabilitate.</v>

3524
01:42:46.730 --> 01:42:47.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3525
01:42:47.150 --> 01:42:48.770
<v Speaker 3>we don't do anything with the mind.</v>

3526
01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3527
01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:49.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3528
01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:51.740
<v Speaker 3>it's not like we take these people and we give them Mtma.</v>

3529
01:42:51.741 --> 01:42:53.600
<v Speaker 3>We put them on Iowasca retreats.</v>

3530
01:42:53.601 --> 01:42:57.650
<v Speaker 3>We try to connect them to their spiritual mother spirit.</v>

3531
01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:58.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3532
01:42:58.160 --> 01:42:59.060
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't know.</v>

3533
01:42:59.061 --> 01:43:03.740
<v Speaker 3>We put them in a jail cell and surround them with fucking psychos and then leave</v>

3534
01:43:03.741 --> 01:43:06.860
<v Speaker 3>them there for 10 years and hope they get better because they feel bad that they</v>

3535
01:43:06.861 --> 01:43:09.230
<v Speaker 3>had to live in this shitty circumstances for 10 years.</v>

3536
01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:10.760
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't fix anybody,</v>

3537
01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:11.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3538
01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:12.111
<v Speaker 4>Then you jump,</v>

3539
01:43:12.111 --> 01:43:12.351
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3540
01:43:12.351 --> 01:43:15.470
<v Speaker 4>So the whole point of like when I cover things as jumping to the other side,</v>

3541
01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:16.910
<v Speaker 4>the other side would then argue,</v>

3542
01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:19.730
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to fucking caudal murderers?</v>

3543
01:43:19.731 --> 01:43:21.440
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to coddle pedophiles?</v>

3544
01:43:21.441 --> 01:43:22.274
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to,</v>

3545
01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:24.170
<v Speaker 4>are you going to punish people?</v>

3546
01:43:24.171 --> 01:43:25.940
<v Speaker 4>Because I think as Americans,</v>

3547
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:26.571
<v Speaker 4>for the most part,</v>

3548
01:43:26.571 --> 01:43:28.460
<v Speaker 4>we think of prison as punishment.</v>

3549
01:43:29.290 --> 01:43:30.140
<v Speaker 4>You fucked up,</v>

3550
01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:34.010
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna fuck you up rather than you messed up.</v>

3551
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:37.010
<v Speaker 4>We want you to be a member of society that is productive.</v>

3552
01:43:37.011 --> 01:43:40.550
<v Speaker 4>So here are classes and here's how you can learn and hear his therapy.</v>

3553
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:43.470
<v Speaker 4>And once again I'm in A.</v>

3554
01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:46.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the gray area because there's like the fucking kid that,</v>

3555
01:43:46.931 --> 01:43:48.830
<v Speaker 4>that bombed the Boston bombing.</v>

3556
01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:50.330
<v Speaker 4>Like kill that kid.</v>

3557
01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:51.680
<v Speaker 4>That's mindset,</v>

3558
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.843
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3559
01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:53.170
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3560
01:43:53.170 --> 01:43:53.870
<v Speaker 4>and it's these,</v>

3561
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:55.280
<v Speaker 4>it's these mass outliers,</v>

3562
01:43:55.281 --> 01:43:55.431
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3563
01:43:55.431 --> 01:43:59.240
<v Speaker 4>These outlier situations that ended up changing my mind on when the Norway</v>

3564
01:43:59.241 --> 01:44:00.074
<v Speaker 4>shooter happened,</v>

3565
01:44:00.190 --> 01:44:00.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3566
01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:01.520
<v Speaker 4>it's like you go,</v>

3567
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:02.090
<v Speaker 4>how did that,</v>

3568
01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:02.930
<v Speaker 4>they don't kill that guy,</v>

3569
01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:03.750
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3570
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:04.760
<v Speaker 4>And so that's,</v>

3571
01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:05.050
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3572
01:44:05.050 --> 01:44:09.080
<v Speaker 4>it's me constantly dealing with it myself and talking to the people that aren't</v>

3573
01:44:09.081 --> 01:44:13.580
<v Speaker 4>assholes online and trying to formulate it and evolve my opinion on it.</v>

3574
01:44:14.070 --> 01:44:14.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3575
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:18.480
<v Speaker 3>And I think also with really complex situations,</v>

3576
01:44:18.481 --> 01:44:20.640
<v Speaker 3>there is no black and white.</v>

3577
01:44:20.670 --> 01:44:23.760
<v Speaker 3>There's no right and wrong and yeah,</v>

3578
01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:27.120
<v Speaker 3>we kind of have to punish people when they do horrible things.</v>

3579
01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:28.530
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

3580
01:44:28.531 --> 01:44:29.400
<v Speaker 3>as a parent,</v>

3581
01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:32.070
<v Speaker 3>as a person who's watching human beings develop,</v>

3582
01:44:32.490 --> 01:44:37.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm realizing that a lot of the problem that we have in our culture is that some</v>

3583
01:44:37.741 --> 01:44:38.970
<v Speaker 3>kids don't get a chance.</v>

3584
01:44:39.090 --> 01:44:39.960
<v Speaker 3>They just don't.</v>

3585
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.310
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

3586
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.630
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3587
01:44:40.630 --> 01:44:41.010
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3588
01:44:41.010 --> 01:44:45.450
<v Speaker 3>they're in bad situations from the jump and they are the product of their</v>

3589
01:44:45.451 --> 01:44:48.810
<v Speaker 3>environment and some of them make it through horrible,</v>

3590
01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:51.060
<v Speaker 3>horrible neighborhoods,</v>

3591
01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:52.350
<v Speaker 3>bad situations.</v>

3592
01:44:52.351 --> 01:44:55.380
<v Speaker 3>They become stronger and better and have more character because of it.</v>

3593
01:44:55.530 --> 01:44:56.940
<v Speaker 3>But we shouldn't expect that.</v>

3594
01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:58.990
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't force them to,</v>

3595
01:44:59.010 --> 01:44:59.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3596
01:44:59.270 --> 01:45:01.770
<v Speaker 3>to be as good as the best people in their neighborhood.</v>

3597
01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:04.710
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody's circumstances very different and I always say,</v>

3598
01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:07.740
<v Speaker 3>this is the way I've been thinking lately.</v>

3599
01:45:07.950 --> 01:45:10.080
<v Speaker 3>If you lived someone's life,</v>

3600
01:45:10.170 --> 01:45:11.490
<v Speaker 3>you would be that person.</v>

3601
01:45:11.730 --> 01:45:12.451
<v Speaker 3>You know you,</v>

3602
01:45:12.451 --> 01:45:13.740
<v Speaker 3>you would be,</v>

3603
01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:14.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3604
01:45:14.371 --> 01:45:15.181
<v Speaker 3>fill in the blanks,</v>

3605
01:45:15.181 --> 01:45:16.014
<v Speaker 3>ray rice,</v>

3606
01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:16.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3607
01:45:16.450 --> 01:45:16.800
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

3608
01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:20.850
<v Speaker 3>if you live that guy's life and found yourself in that elevator with your</v>

3609
01:45:20.851 --> 01:45:22.590
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend and punched her in the face,</v>

3610
01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:23.340
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3611
01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:24.020
<v Speaker 3>you're him.</v>

3612
01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:26.580
<v Speaker 3>You were that guy that is possible to become.</v>

3613
01:45:26.581 --> 01:45:29.670
<v Speaker 3>That person should be punished him abso-fucking-lutely,</v>

3614
01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:34.680
<v Speaker 3>but should we also recognize that you become a god that's willing to hit a</v>

3615
01:45:34.681 --> 01:45:36.180
<v Speaker 3>person or hit a woman?</v>

3616
01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:41.330
<v Speaker 3>You become a that through a lot of different variables through the way you were</v>

3617
01:45:41.461 --> 01:45:42.180
<v Speaker 3>raised,</v>

3618
01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:44.520
<v Speaker 3>the type of people that you communicated with,</v>

3619
01:45:44.670 --> 01:45:46.410
<v Speaker 3>the type of relationship you're in.</v>

3620
01:45:46.530 --> 01:45:48.420
<v Speaker 3>She is the wife hit him.</v>

3621
01:45:48.690 --> 01:45:48.991
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3622
01:45:48.991 --> 01:45:50.130
<v Speaker 3>like they're hitting each other.</v>

3623
01:45:50.131 --> 01:45:50.964
<v Speaker 3>They do that.</v>

3624
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.600
<v Speaker 3>There's obviously there is some sort of a abusive physical relationship.</v>

3625
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:55.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3626
01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:55.251
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3627
01:45:55.251 --> 01:45:57.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure you're not that kind of a guy.</v>

3628
01:45:57.450 --> 01:45:59.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely not that kind of a guy,</v>

3629
01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:03.840
<v Speaker 3>but is it because you didn't grow up that way if you grew up around a mom and</v>

3630
01:46:03.841 --> 01:46:07.400
<v Speaker 3>dad that beat the shit out of you and your dad beat the shit out of your mom and</v>

3631
01:46:07.401 --> 01:46:10.080
<v Speaker 3>you beat the shit out of your girlfriends and they beat the shit out of you.</v>

3632
01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:13.020
<v Speaker 3>You're throwing shoes at each other and duck and plates.</v>

3633
01:46:13.230 --> 01:46:16.430
<v Speaker 3>Then you be that fucking person I think maybe be</v>

3634
01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:19.780
<v Speaker 4>right because like my mom was nightmare growing up.</v>

3635
01:46:19.781 --> 01:46:20.560
<v Speaker 4>Like she's,</v>

3636
01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:22.780
<v Speaker 4>she's done that thing where as they get older,</v>

3637
01:46:22.781 --> 01:46:23.480
<v Speaker 4>like she,</v>

3638
01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:25.720
<v Speaker 4>she became a nurse and she's like taking care of people now.</v>

3639
01:46:25.870 --> 01:46:27.670
<v Speaker 4>But like she beat the fuck out of me sometimes.</v>

3640
01:46:27.690 --> 01:46:29.110
<v Speaker 4>Like just for no reason,</v>

3641
01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.700
<v Speaker 4>like for no reason.</v>

3642
01:46:30.930 --> 01:46:32.110
<v Speaker 4>It was like a bad day.</v>

3643
01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:33.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3644
01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:34.960
<v Speaker 4>And it's not like it happened all the time.</v>

3645
01:46:34.961 --> 01:46:35.201
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3646
01:46:35.201 --> 01:46:35.830
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

3647
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:38.140
<v Speaker 4>it's not the worst situation that's ever happened.</v>

3648
01:46:38.410 --> 01:46:39.280
<v Speaker 4>When I was growing up.</v>

3649
01:46:39.530 --> 01:46:40.363
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

3650
01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:44.890
<v Speaker 4>my dad would use me to help steal stuff from like Walmart so that we can bring</v>

3651
01:46:44.891 --> 01:46:46.490
<v Speaker 4>it back and we could get money like,</v>

3652
01:46:46.510 --> 01:46:49.770
<v Speaker 4>so I didn't come from this place where was just like,</v>

3653
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.410
<v Speaker 5>everything's easy and everyone's on that open up,</v>

3654
01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:57.120
<v Speaker 5>but I also don't do that now that I'm an adult because I think I saw those</v>

3655
01:46:57.121 --> 01:46:58.980
<v Speaker 5>things and then I looked outside and I was like,</v>

3656
01:46:59.010 --> 01:46:59.131
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3657
01:46:59.131 --> 01:46:59.880
<v Speaker 5>that's fucked up.</v>

3658
01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:00.810
<v Speaker 5>You don't do that.</v>

3659
01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:01.021
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3660
01:47:01.021 --> 01:47:03.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm never going to hit my wife.</v>

3661
01:47:03.061 --> 01:47:05.430
<v Speaker 5>I don't want my kid,</v>

3662
01:47:05.730 --> 01:47:06.540
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3663
01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:07.380
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>

3664
01:47:07.381 --> 01:47:08.101
<v Speaker 5>never hit my wife,</v>

3665
01:47:08.101 --> 01:47:09.060
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want to hit my.</v>

3666
01:47:09.090 --> 01:47:09.211
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3667
01:47:09.211 --> 01:47:10.920
<v Speaker 5>my dad's little motherfucker gets crazy.</v>

3668
01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:12.390
<v Speaker 5>My Dad slapped me one time.</v>

3669
01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:14.670
<v Speaker 5>I was like six years old and I said,</v>

3670
01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:15.331
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

3671
01:47:15.331 --> 01:47:16.220
<v Speaker 5>And he slapped me once.</v>

3672
01:47:16.230 --> 01:47:17.100
<v Speaker 5>I'll never said it again.</v>

3673
01:47:17.170 --> 01:47:19.790
<v Speaker 5>I like how you said it in a six year old tone.</v>

3674
01:47:21.210 --> 01:47:21.720
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man,</v>

3675
01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:22.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm waiting.</v>

3676
01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:23.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm waiting for him to say fuck you.</v>

3677
01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:24.930
<v Speaker 5>And I hate you.</v>

3678
01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:25.770
<v Speaker 5>Ooh.</v>

3679
01:47:25.770 --> 01:47:26.603
<v Speaker 5>Those were mean.</v>

3680
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:27.720
<v Speaker 5>That wasn't mean words,</v>

3681
01:47:27.721 --> 01:47:28.501
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3682
01:47:28.501 --> 01:47:29.550
<v Speaker 5>it's your responsibility to go,</v>

3683
01:47:29.551 --> 01:47:29.851
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3684
01:47:29.851 --> 01:47:31.090
<v Speaker 5>you don't relax.</v>

3685
01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:31.650
<v Speaker 5>My Dad,</v>

3686
01:47:31.650 --> 01:47:32.940
<v Speaker 5>when my dad would just,</v>

3687
01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:33.893
<v Speaker 5>he would annoy me,</v>

3688
01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:34.321
<v Speaker 5>he would just say,</v>

3689
01:47:34.321 --> 01:47:34.920
<v Speaker 5>I ate you.</v>

3690
01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:35.211
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

3691
01:47:35.211 --> 01:47:35.940
<v Speaker 5>you ate me,</v>

01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:41.671
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3695
01:47:41.671 --> 01:47:43.020
<v Speaker 5>My six year old gets mad if she,</v>

3696
01:47:43.021 --> 01:47:45.270
<v Speaker 5>if she pouts and starts whining about things.</v>

3697
01:47:45.271 --> 01:47:46.020
<v Speaker 5>If I go,</v>

3698
01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:46.620
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3699

3700
01:47:50.190 --> 01:47:50.851
<v Speaker 5>she'll freak out.</v>

3701
01:47:50.851 --> 01:47:51.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3702
01:47:51.210 --> 01:47:52.440
<v Speaker 5>it could be about nothing,</v>

3703
01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:53.353
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3704
01:47:53.650 --> 01:47:53.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3705
01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:54.920
<v Speaker 3>She's a little human being.</v>

3706
01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:57.110
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about human beings.</v>

3707
01:47:57.111 --> 01:47:57.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3708
01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:02.440
<v Speaker 3>there they are this just bundle of potential and there's all these events and</v>

3709
01:48:03.891 --> 01:48:06.710
<v Speaker 3>variables that happen in your life that create who you are.</v>

3710
01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:12.280
<v Speaker 3>And I think that most human beings that raise children really don't know what</v>

3711
01:48:12.321 --> 01:48:16.790
<v Speaker 3>they're getting into when they started off and hopefully along the way they</v>

3712
01:48:16.791 --> 01:48:19.460
<v Speaker 3>develop a better person than they were.</v>

3713
01:48:19.670 --> 01:48:20.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3714
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:23.690
<v Speaker 3>that they do a better job of parenting based on the experiences that they've had</v>

3715
01:48:23.691 --> 01:48:27.530
<v Speaker 3>with their parents and the mistakes that they're aware that their parents made</v>

3716
01:48:27.531 --> 01:48:28.370
<v Speaker 3>and hopefully we learn,</v>

3717
01:48:28.371 --> 01:48:33.371
<v Speaker 3>but we're still just learning the effects of behavior and what it's like when</v>

3718
01:48:34.581 --> 01:48:34.941
<v Speaker 3>you raise.</v>

3719
01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:37.760
<v Speaker 3>Kids were still learning that we're still going over that and a lot of people</v>

3720
01:48:37.761 --> 01:48:38.391
<v Speaker 3>are terrible at.</v>

3721
01:48:38.391 --> 01:48:42.740
<v Speaker 3>I watched some fucking unit yell at her kid and pull him by the arm.</v>

3722
01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:45.530
<v Speaker 3>It's screaming that he's going to beat the tar out of him and I'm like,</v>

3723
01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:47.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck man,</v>

3724
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:50.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching some kid be raised by a moron,</v>

3725
01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:50.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3726
01:48:50.571 --> 01:48:52.670
<v Speaker 3>and he's going to have to unlearn all this shit.</v>

3727
01:48:52.671 --> 01:48:53.960
<v Speaker 3>This more is teaching them.</v>

3728
01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:54.973
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

3729
01:48:55.250 --> 01:48:55.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3730
01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.880
<v Speaker 3>in some extreme situations like extreme abuse and extreme neglect and extreme</v>

3731
01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:04.010
<v Speaker 3>sexual abuse and violence,</v>

3732
01:49:04.011 --> 01:49:04.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3733
01:49:04.221 --> 01:49:07.430
<v Speaker 3>you're going to develop a horrible person that's dealt with these variables</v>

3734
01:49:07.431 --> 01:49:08.250
<v Speaker 3>their whole life.</v>

3735
01:49:08.250 --> 01:49:09.350
<v Speaker 3>This is who they are,</v>

3736
01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:09.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3737
01:49:09.851 --> 01:49:10.250
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

3738
01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:10.701
<v Speaker 3>this is the,</v>

3739
01:49:10.701 --> 01:49:14.270
<v Speaker 3>there are the product of all the things that have happened to them and how</v>

3740
01:49:14.271 --> 01:49:15.650
<v Speaker 3>they've processed those things.</v>

3741
01:49:15.870 --> 01:49:16.770
<v Speaker 5>But at the end of the day,</v>

3742
01:49:17.010 --> 01:49:20.160
<v Speaker 5>do you want that end product next to your kid?</v>

3743
01:49:20.190 --> 01:49:20.510
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3744
01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:21.010
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3745
01:49:21.010 --> 01:49:21.160
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

3746
01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:21.993
<v Speaker 3>but that's the thing is like,</v>

3747
01:49:22.210 --> 01:49:24.640
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how that's fixable.</v>

3748
01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:25.780
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>

3749
01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:31.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if there's a way to reset the mind and some sort of a functional</v>

3750
01:49:32.741 --> 01:49:37.741
<v Speaker 3>way and it may be some sort of a psychedelic thing or it may be something that</v>

3751
01:49:37.871 --> 01:49:40.920
<v Speaker 3>has to do with neuroscience in the future with a.</v>

3752
01:49:41.050 --> 01:49:45.550
<v Speaker 3>They find out the issues of the human brain and they can literally reprogram the</v>

3753
01:49:45.551 --> 01:49:50.551
<v Speaker 3>mind and some sort of way and get them in in some unforeseen future technology,</v>

3754
01:49:53.211 --> 01:49:58.211
<v Speaker 3>some way to understand like why they've become this person,</v>

3755
01:49:58.510 --> 01:50:00.190
<v Speaker 3>why they are abusive,</v>

3756
01:50:00.191 --> 01:50:02.800
<v Speaker 3>why they are self destructive.</v>

3757
01:50:03.010 --> 01:50:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Maybe someone who's a drug addict who hates themselves.</v>

3758
01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:06.671
<v Speaker 3>You find out,</v>

3759
01:50:06.671 --> 01:50:06.791
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3760
01:50:06.791 --> 01:50:09.100
<v Speaker 3>you really hate yourself because your mother hated you.</v>

3761
01:50:09.290 --> 01:50:09.581
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3762
01:50:09.581 --> 01:50:10.450
<v Speaker 3>this is what it is.</v>

3763
01:50:10.451 --> 01:50:15.451
<v Speaker 3>Like you have this horrible reaction to being raised by this awful person and we</v>

3764
01:50:16.090 --> 01:50:17.370
<v Speaker 3>found the core of it like,</v>

3765
01:50:17.650 --> 01:50:18.880
<v Speaker 3>like you have an electrical problem.</v>

3766
01:50:18.881 --> 01:50:19.091
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3767
01:50:19.091 --> 01:50:19.811
<v Speaker 3>well here it is.</v>

3768
01:50:19.811 --> 01:50:22.360
<v Speaker 3>We found the wire has a slice in it.</v>

3769
01:50:22.570 --> 01:50:23.360
<v Speaker 3>It's getting,</v>

3770
01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:23.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3771
01:50:23.770 --> 01:50:24.750
<v Speaker 3>the water's getting in.</v>

3772
01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:25.840
<v Speaker 3>It's shorting out.</v>

3773
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:27.280
<v Speaker 3>We'll just fix that wire.</v>

3774
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:28.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3775
01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:29.201
<v Speaker 3>if people.</v>

3776
01:50:29.201 --> 01:50:31.480
<v Speaker 3>If we can get to that point at some,</v>

3777
01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:34.330
<v Speaker 3>we can fix a lot of the problems in society.</v>

3778
01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:34.911
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

3779
01:50:34.911 --> 01:50:35.601
<v Speaker 4>but then who's to.</v>

3780
01:50:35.601 --> 01:50:37.370
<v Speaker 4>Who's to say what's right and wrong at that point?</v>

3781
01:50:37.690 --> 01:50:39.550
<v Speaker 4>Who's to say that you're broken.</v>

3782
01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:40.221
<v Speaker 4>You're not like,</v>

3783
01:50:40.221 --> 01:50:41.140
<v Speaker 4>where is that?</v>

3784
01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:41.831
<v Speaker 4>You do.</v>

3785
01:50:41.831 --> 01:50:42.650
<v Speaker 4>You take out the human,</v>

3786
01:50:42.650 --> 01:50:43.970
<v Speaker 4>essentially you're taking out the human,</v>

3787
01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:45.230
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3788
01:50:45.230 --> 01:50:45.840
<v Speaker 4>Because it's.</v>

3789
01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:49.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean at the end we kind of our wires but kind not wires.</v>

3790
01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:50.630
<v Speaker 3>Well then it comes back to the alien,</v>

3791
01:50:50.631 --> 01:50:51.464
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3792
01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:52.041
<v Speaker 3>Always.</v>

3793
01:50:52.041 --> 01:50:53.960
<v Speaker 3>That's the alien.</v>

3794
01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:56.720
<v Speaker 3>Sexless muscle lists.</v>

3795
01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:58.160
<v Speaker 3>Speechless.</v>

3796
01:50:58.610 --> 01:50:59.910
<v Speaker 4>You don't know if that dude,</v>

3797
01:50:59.911 --> 01:51:00.591
<v Speaker 4>if that alien,</v>

3798
01:51:00.591 --> 01:51:01.351
<v Speaker 4>it beats his wife.</v>

3799
01:51:01.351 --> 01:51:02.320
<v Speaker 4>You don't know he could.</v>

3800
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:03.930
<v Speaker 3>They beat anything.</v>

3801
01:51:03.931 --> 01:51:04.830
<v Speaker 3>They're so skinny.</v>

3802
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:06.470
<v Speaker 3>I think that get away with it.</v>

3803
01:51:06.510 --> 01:51:07.500
<v Speaker 3>Wife kick his ass.</v>

3804
01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:13.360
<v Speaker 3>I had this guy on Zoltan Istvan who's a futurist and he's one of those trans</v>

3805
01:51:14.211 --> 01:51:15.510
<v Speaker 3>humanism proponents.</v>

3806
01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3807
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:17.040
<v Speaker 3>And Fascinating Guy,</v>

3808
01:51:17.041 --> 01:51:21.870
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that he said is that these people that have recently,</v>

3809
01:51:22.290 --> 01:51:23.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're aware of this technology,</v>

3810
01:51:23.881 --> 01:51:28.881
<v Speaker 3>that they've recently been able to transmit words across the Internet to someone</v>

3811
01:51:29.161 --> 01:51:31.170
<v Speaker 3>wearing a helmet like with no,</v>

3812
01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:33.030
<v Speaker 3>with no words spoken.</v>

3813
01:51:33.290 --> 01:51:33.680
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

3814
01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:37.470
<v Speaker 3>you think a word and having this helmet on this,</v>

3815
01:51:37.471 --> 01:51:42.471
<v Speaker 3>this series of electrodes that attached to your head that somehow understand the</v>

3816
01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:45.720
<v Speaker 3>what part of your brain is firing up.</v>

3817
01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:47.490
<v Speaker 3>When you think of a word like hello,</v>

3818
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:48.150
<v Speaker 3>right before it.</v>

3819
01:51:48.150 --> 01:51:48.690
<v Speaker 3>Hello?</v>

3820
01:51:48.690 --> 01:51:49.231
<v Speaker 3>Hello.</v>

3821
01:51:49.231 --> 01:51:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Registers in some sort of an area of your brain.</v>

3822
01:51:51.870 --> 01:51:55.410
<v Speaker 3>This person wears his helmet and they hear hello in their mind.</v>

3823
01:51:55.590 --> 01:51:56.220
<v Speaker 3>That's wild dam.</v>

3824
01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:56.521
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3825
01:51:56.521 --> 01:51:57.690
<v Speaker 3>and they hear it through the Internet.</v>

3826
01:51:57.870 --> 01:51:58.021
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3827
01:51:58.021 --> 01:52:01.220
<v Speaker 3>he said that they believe that this technology over the next couple of decades</v>

3828
01:52:01.230 --> 01:52:06.230
<v Speaker 3>going to advance so fast and so strong that we are going to lose communication</v>

3829
01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:08.670
<v Speaker 3>like oral communication.</v>

3830
01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:10.770
<v Speaker 3>We're going to speak directly,</v>

3831
01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:12.780
<v Speaker 3>mind to mind from now on.</v>

3832
01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:12.981
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3833
01:52:12.981 --> 01:52:13.760
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if,</v>

3834
01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:16.370
<v Speaker 4>because obviously it sounds like they have someone go,</v>

3835
01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:16.821
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3836
01:52:16.821 --> 01:52:18.860
<v Speaker 4>think of apple 20 different times,</v>

3837
01:52:18.861 --> 01:52:19.191
<v Speaker 4>apple,</v>

3838
01:52:19.191 --> 01:52:19.431
<v Speaker 4>apple,</v>

3839
01:52:19.431 --> 01:52:19.731
<v Speaker 4>apple,</v>

3840
01:52:19.731 --> 01:52:20.600
<v Speaker 4>and then think of banana.</v>

3841
01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.670
<v Speaker 4>Is it that big of a difference?</v>

3842
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:25.700
<v Speaker 4>Is it where are you gonna be able to get all the small intricacies or is it</v>

3843
01:52:25.701 --> 01:52:26.510
<v Speaker 4>going to be like,</v>

3844
01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:28.070
<v Speaker 4>this is anger.</v>

3845
01:52:28.250 --> 01:52:28.490
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3846
01:52:28.490 --> 01:52:29.230
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

3847
01:52:29.230 --> 01:52:32.590
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if you have to like look at an apple and send me wonder how many things</v>

3848
01:52:32.591 --> 01:52:36.700
<v Speaker 3>are involved if like you have to see a visual apple and think the word apple so</v>

3849
01:52:36.701 --> 01:52:41.620
<v Speaker 3>that your mind knows this is like if you're visually sending that information as</v>

3850
01:52:41.621 --> 01:52:44.020
<v Speaker 3>well as sending the word to the mind.</v>

3851
01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 4>Well saw a video</v>

3852
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:49.160
<v Speaker 1>this morning of a guy that was like 40 years ago.</v>

3853
01:52:49.161 --> 01:52:54.161
<v Speaker 1>He lost both of his arms and he went to John Hopkins and they were testing this</v>

3854
01:52:54.261 --> 01:52:58.760
<v Speaker 1>new stuff on them and they put it on and they just said like think about moving</v>

3855
01:52:58.761 --> 01:52:59.480
<v Speaker 1>your hands.</v>

3856
01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:02.810
<v Speaker 1>And so we thought about rotating his hands out and they did like a full three</v>

3857
01:53:02.811 --> 01:53:03.590
<v Speaker 1>60.</v>

3858
01:53:03.590 --> 01:53:04.670
<v Speaker 1>He could move them a little.</v>

3859
01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the technology is really early on,</v>

3860
01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:11.480
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that he can think turn left and a bunch of Zeros and ones or</v>

3861
01:53:11.481 --> 01:53:14.840
<v Speaker 1>whatever gets thrown into this machine via his nerves and it happens.</v>

3862
01:53:14.841 --> 01:53:15.441
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

3863
01:53:15.441 --> 01:53:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Like where are we going to be in 20 years?</v>

3864
01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Most of the video today of the guy with a two percent of arms,</v>

3865
01:53:22.330 --> 01:53:24.380
<v Speaker 1>we lost them in electrical is electrical,</v>

3866
01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:26.350
<v Speaker 1>so they called it like a freak electrical accident.</v>

3867
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.980
<v Speaker 1>We're going to,</v>

3868
01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:27.910
<v Speaker 1>in 20 years from now,</v>

3869
01:53:27.911 --> 01:53:32.020
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have completely new limbs just like Luke skywalker did when darth</v>

3870
01:53:32.021 --> 01:53:33.070
<v Speaker 1>vader cut off his hand.</v>

3871
01:53:33.070 --> 01:53:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Remember that shit?</v>

3872
01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3873
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:34.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3874
01:53:34.061 --> 01:53:34.894
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's it.</v>

3875
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:36.191
<v Speaker 1>Those are.</v>

3876
01:53:36.191 --> 01:53:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things that are most exciting about three d printing,</v>

3877
01:53:38.381 --> 01:53:39.430
<v Speaker 1>like medical reasons.</v>

3878
01:53:39.790 --> 01:53:40.361
<v Speaker 1>That's huge.</v>

3879
01:53:40.361 --> 01:53:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Not me making a key chain.</v>

3880
01:53:42.190 --> 01:53:44.500
<v Speaker 1>They've already figured out how to three D print meniscus,</v>

3881
01:53:44.770 --> 01:53:49.450
<v Speaker 1>they've figured out a three d print knee meniscus with this is a special type.</v>

3882
01:53:49.570 --> 01:53:53.110
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially a scaffolding with a special type of protein in it and when</v>

3883
01:53:53.111 --> 01:53:54.280
<v Speaker 1>they inserted into the body,</v>

3884
01:53:54.281 --> 01:53:59.281
<v Speaker 1>the body replaces meniscus on the scaffolding and so like where they are now.</v>

3885
01:53:59.931 --> 01:54:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I've had meniscus scoped on one of my knees so I tore.</v>

3886
01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Some of it is really fucking painful.</v>

3887
01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:07.300
<v Speaker 1>They had a bucket handle tear,</v>

3888
01:54:07.301 --> 01:54:08.590
<v Speaker 1>which means it would lock,</v>

3889
01:54:08.710 --> 01:54:11.820
<v Speaker 1>it would like lock out and so they go in there and they scoop it out and they</v>

3890
01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:14.770
<v Speaker 1>cut it and they and you heal up and it works great now,</v>

3891
01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:19.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as effective because you lose some of the cushioning between your</v>

3892
01:54:19.541 --> 01:54:20.140
<v Speaker 1>joints.</v>

3893
01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:20.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3894
01:54:20.321 --> 01:54:23.680
<v Speaker 1>what they're going to be able to do now is create with three d printing this</v>

3895
01:54:23.681 --> 01:54:26.500
<v Speaker 1>artificial scaffolding for the meniscus with these proteins in it,</v>

3896
01:54:26.501 --> 01:54:28.930
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to have a 100 percent new meniscus.</v>

3897
01:54:29.110 --> 01:54:30.580
<v Speaker 1>It's going to grow back in place,</v>

3898
01:54:30.581 --> 01:54:32.320
<v Speaker 1>which is a life changing thing.</v>

3899
01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:33.310
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

3900
01:54:33.310 --> 01:54:33.761
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3901
01:54:33.761 --> 01:54:36.160
<v Speaker 1>We posted this to dog can walk again.</v>

3902
01:54:36.161 --> 01:54:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to three d printing.</v>

3903
01:54:37.630 --> 01:54:38.470
<v Speaker 1>That was he walking?</v>

3904
01:54:38.471 --> 01:54:39.304
<v Speaker 1>It's got wheels.</v>

3905
01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:41.190
<v Speaker 1>It's the cuter version of what this,</v>

3906
01:54:42.430 --> 01:54:43.150
<v Speaker 1>what does he got?</v>

3907
01:54:43.150 --> 01:54:43.540
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

3908
01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:44.890
<v Speaker 1>They printed out like these,</v>

3909
01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:45.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3910
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:46.660
<v Speaker 1>kind of like legs almost.</v>

3911
01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I can't play the video.</v>

3912
01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:49.420
<v Speaker 1>He's the dog blade runner.</v>

3913
01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:51.213
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

3914
01:54:51.610 --> 01:54:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3915
01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're going to be able to do anything.</v>

3916
01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:55.330
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be able to make human beings like we were talking about the</v>

3917
01:54:55.331 --> 01:54:56.890
<v Speaker 1>artificial fuck robot,</v>

3918
01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:01.150
<v Speaker 1>people thinking to make that it's going to happen if people live to be a</v>

3919
01:55:01.150 --> 01:55:01.840
<v Speaker 1>thousand years from now,</v>

3920
01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:02.900
<v Speaker 1>if that's going to be real,</v>

3921
01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:05.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be so sad that they're gonna make sex robots before they do.</v>

3922
01:55:05.450 --> 01:55:06.120
<v Speaker 4>Oregon's like,</v>

3923
01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:06.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3924
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:07.010
<v Speaker 4>that's gonna happen.</v>

3925
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

3926
01:55:07.941 --> 01:55:09.290
<v Speaker 1>I think Oregon will be first.</v>

3927
01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I think it organs would be first before they can figure out a way to be a whole</v>

3928
01:55:12.171 --> 01:55:12.621
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

3929
01:55:12.621 --> 01:55:12.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3930
01:55:12.771 --> 01:55:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3931
01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:14.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's going to be amazing,</v>

3932
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:17.110
<v Speaker 4>but it's always a weird thing because I have this,</v>

3933
01:55:17.111 --> 01:55:17.211
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3934
01:55:17.211 --> 01:55:18.041
<v Speaker 4>I have this thing called,</v>

3935
01:55:18.041 --> 01:55:18.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3936
01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:20.530
<v Speaker 4>pkd polycystic kidney disease.</v>

3937
01:55:20.770 --> 01:55:22.030
<v Speaker 4>It's a genetic thing,</v>

3938
01:55:22.031 --> 01:55:24.670
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes I look at it and I'm like,</v>

3939
01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:25.600
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

3940
01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:26.650
<v Speaker 4>this shouldn't be here.</v>

3941
01:55:26.651 --> 01:55:28.360
<v Speaker 4>Like I shouldn't pass this on anymore.</v>

3942
01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:32.410
<v Speaker 4>Been we as a society and as technology advances I get to live.</v>

3943
01:55:32.670 --> 01:55:34.240
<v Speaker 4>And what is it involved?</v>

3944
01:55:34.250 --> 01:55:37.840
<v Speaker 4>Like what cysts grow over time it'll really hit me.</v>

3945
01:55:37.841 --> 01:55:39.370
<v Speaker 4>I think around when I'm like 35,</v>

3946
01:55:39.371 --> 01:55:39.850
<v Speaker 4>40,</v>

3947
01:55:39.850 --> 01:55:40.683
<v Speaker 4>that's when I hit my dad.</v>

3948
01:55:40.830 --> 01:55:42.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm cis form on your kidney.</v>

3949
01:55:42.761 --> 01:55:47.400
<v Speaker 4>And it just essentially slowly squeezes it to death and so late term you need to</v>

3950
01:55:47.401 --> 01:55:48.120
<v Speaker 4>get a,</v>

3951
01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:51.360
<v Speaker 4>like you have to go on dialysis because their kidneys are failing and then uh,</v>

3952
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:53.400
<v Speaker 4>and then you kinda just have to get on the donor list.</v>

3953
01:55:53.710 --> 01:55:54.410
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3954
01:55:54.410 --> 01:55:54.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3955
01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:55.470
<v Speaker 4>It's uh,</v>

3956
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:56.250
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3957
01:55:56.250 --> 01:55:57.001
<v Speaker 4>it's rough stuff.</v>

3958
01:55:57.001 --> 01:55:57.780
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

3959
01:55:57.780 --> 01:55:58.970
<v Speaker 4>it hasn't affected me yet,</v>

3960
01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:03.420
<v Speaker 4>but it's like that thought that I sometimes have when I'm laying down at night</v>

3961
01:56:03.421 --> 01:56:04.770
<v Speaker 4>and just thinking of like infinity,</v>

3962
01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:05.933
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3963
01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:06.700
<v Speaker 4>that I,</v>

3964
01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:08.760
<v Speaker 4>my specific cells,</v>

3965
01:56:08.761 --> 01:56:10.830
<v Speaker 4>my jeans shouldn't be passed on.</v>

3966
01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:11.281
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3967
01:56:11.281 --> 01:56:13.200
<v Speaker 4>If you think of us advancing,</v>

3968
01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:16.230
<v Speaker 4>but then technology kind of brings me back along.</v>

3969
01:56:16.231 --> 01:56:16.500
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3970
01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:17.160
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3971
01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:19.440
<v Speaker 4>in like a hundred years we'll be able to make those kidneys again.</v>

3972
01:56:19.441 --> 01:56:19.910
<v Speaker 4>You're fine.</v>

3973
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:20.061
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3974
01:56:20.061 --> 01:56:20.410
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

3975
01:56:20.410 --> 01:56:21.740
<v Speaker 3>you used to have diabetes,</v>

3976
01:56:21.741 --> 01:56:22.400
<v Speaker 3>we're dead,</v>

3977
01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:22.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3978
01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:23.091
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3979
01:56:23.091 --> 01:56:25.370
<v Speaker 3>there was a death sentence and now it's not.</v>

3980
01:56:25.371 --> 01:56:26.780
<v Speaker 3>Now you get on insulin,</v>

3981
01:56:26.781 --> 01:56:29.660
<v Speaker 3>they figured out a way to change your diet and that's a huge issue as well.</v>

3982
01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:31.310
<v Speaker 3>Does that have anything to do with your diet?</v>

3983
01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:33.850
<v Speaker 3>With the kidneys is the right way to long it?</v>

3984
01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:33.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3985
01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:34.750
<v Speaker 4>Oregon kind of like,</v>

3986
01:56:34.750 --> 01:56:37.020
<v Speaker 4>I have to make sure that I always drink a lot,</v>

3987
01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:40.200
<v Speaker 4>a ton of water and drinking should be problematic.</v>

3988
01:56:40.201 --> 01:56:40.421
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3989
01:56:40.421 --> 01:56:41.610
<v Speaker 4>Is drinking alcohol.</v>

3990
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:42.780
<v Speaker 4>I think that's more.</v>

3991
01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:44.700
<v Speaker 4>I think that's more of a liver.</v>

3992
01:56:44.701 --> 01:56:45.031
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3993
01:56:45.031 --> 01:56:45.630
<v Speaker 4>I um,</v>

3994
01:56:45.630 --> 01:56:46.710
<v Speaker 4>for the most part it's just.</v>

3995
01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:47.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3996
01:56:47.130 --> 01:56:48.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm starting to think more about my health.</v>

3997
01:56:48.991 --> 01:56:49.261
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3998
01:56:49.261 --> 01:56:51.360
<v Speaker 4>you guys were talking about like going up and down in weight.</v>

3999
01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:51.930
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4000
01:56:51.930 --> 01:56:55.560
<v Speaker 4>I dropped 35 pounds this year mainly because I just,</v>

4001
01:56:55.590 --> 01:56:56.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't wanna die.</v>

4002
01:56:57.600 --> 01:56:58.920
<v Speaker 4>I wanna I want to be able to.</v>

4003
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:59.810
<v Speaker 4>Because also when,</v>

4004
01:56:59.870 --> 01:57:01.080
<v Speaker 4>when pkd hits me harder,</v>

4005
01:57:01.081 --> 01:57:02.940
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna be harder to exercise.</v>

4006
01:57:02.941 --> 01:57:07.200
<v Speaker 4>I have to like train myself essentially to just not eat like an asshole like I</v>

4007
01:57:07.201 --> 01:57:07.690
<v Speaker 4>normally do.</v>

4008
01:57:07.690 --> 01:57:08.523
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4009
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4010
01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:10.071
<v Speaker 3>That's intense.</v>

4011
01:57:10.071 --> 01:57:10.370
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

4012
01:57:10.370 --> 01:57:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Kidneys are a big one in mixed martial arts because guys cut weight a lot and so</v>

4013
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:16.880
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them wind up getting kidney stones.</v>

4014
01:57:17.450 --> 01:57:18.283
<v Speaker 3>That's the worst thing.</v>

4015
01:57:19.370 --> 01:57:21.320
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it's a genetic thing.</v>

4016
01:57:21.321 --> 01:57:22.700
<v Speaker 3>Some people just don't ever get it,</v>

4017
01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:24.830
<v Speaker 3>but some people when they cut weight,</v>

4018
01:57:24.831 --> 01:57:28.730
<v Speaker 3>kidney stones become a huge issue and it has something to do with dehydration.</v>

4019
01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:31.640
<v Speaker 3>Dee Dee dee dehydration slash genetics.</v>

4020
01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:32.061
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4021
01:57:32.061 --> 01:57:32.451
<v Speaker 4>I've had,</v>

4022
01:57:32.451 --> 01:57:36.620
<v Speaker 4>I've had one because I think there's like a 40 percent higher chance that if you</v>

4023
01:57:36.621 --> 01:57:37.091
<v Speaker 4>have it you will,</v>

4024
01:57:37.091 --> 01:57:39.140
<v Speaker 4>you'll get more kidney stones have.</v>

4025
01:57:39.141 --> 01:57:41.810
<v Speaker 4>You Don't have to pee it out.</v>

4026
01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:42.673
<v Speaker 4>Is that what happened?</v>

4027
01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:43.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4028
01:57:43.010 --> 01:57:45.480
<v Speaker 4>So mine mine was a,</v>

4029
01:57:45.481 --> 01:57:47.810
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't so big that they had to like try and blast it.</v>

4030
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.350
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4031
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.891
<v Speaker 4>but they essentially,</v>

4032
01:57:48.891 --> 01:57:52.340
<v Speaker 4>I think that they gave me percocet and I was essentially in and out for three</v>

4033
01:57:52.341 --> 01:57:55.160
<v Speaker 4>days at home and at some point I paid it out.</v>

4034
01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:56.511
<v Speaker 4>I was just like,</v>

4035
01:57:56.511 --> 01:57:57.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to drug this one out.</v>

4036
01:57:58.390 --> 01:58:00.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing this because I was like,</v>

4037
01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:01.101
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4038
01:58:01.101 --> 01:58:03.280
<v Speaker 4>now maybe it's just I have back pain like first day,</v>

4039
01:58:03.281 --> 01:58:03.920
<v Speaker 4>the second day.</v>

4040
01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:04.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4041
01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:05.480
<v Speaker 4>went away third day.</v>

4042
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.661
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4043
01:58:05.661 --> 01:58:06.494
<v Speaker 4>it just moved,</v>

4044
01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:07.520
<v Speaker 4>like that's what it was.</v>

4045
01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:10.760
<v Speaker 4>The pain is just a different place and yeah,</v>

4046
01:58:10.761 --> 01:58:13.610
<v Speaker 4>that was the least fun thing I've experienced in my life,</v>

4047
01:58:13.611 --> 01:58:13.930
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4048
01:58:13.930 --> 01:58:16.620
<v Speaker 3>Being out of little rock and then imagine giving birth.</v>

4049
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:18.360
<v Speaker 3>Imagine what women goes.</v>

4050
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:19.540
<v Speaker 4>You did your actual</v>

4051
01:58:21.690 --> 01:58:25.410
<v Speaker 4>dose dose out twice crazy.</v>

4052
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:26.490
<v Speaker 4>I thought I'd never want to.</v>

4053
01:58:26.491 --> 01:58:27.390
<v Speaker 4>And then I was just like,</v>

4054
01:58:27.391 --> 01:58:27.541
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4055
01:58:27.541 --> 01:58:27.990
<v Speaker 4>I have to.</v>

4056
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:29.010
<v Speaker 4>Got To have to be there.</v>

4057
01:58:29.230 --> 01:58:29.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4058
01:58:29.710 --> 01:58:30.310
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>

4059
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:31.300
<v Speaker 3>it's beautiful in a way.</v>

4060
01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:32.530
<v Speaker 3>It's strange.</v>

4061
01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:33.250
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

4062
01:58:33.250 --> 01:58:33.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4063
01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:38.500
<v Speaker 3>it's very oddly psychedelic because when that child was coming out of my wife's</v>

4064
01:58:40.241 --> 01:58:41.050
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>

4065
01:58:41.050 --> 01:58:42.460
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking to myself like,</v>

4066
01:58:42.461 --> 01:58:42.910
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

4067
01:58:42.910 --> 01:58:45.580
<v Speaker 3>this is what's happening right now.</v>

4068
01:58:45.790 --> 01:58:48.340
<v Speaker 3>All over the world and mass.</v>

4069
01:58:48.670 --> 01:58:51.810
<v Speaker 3>There are millions of babies coming out of a giant,</v>

4070
01:58:51.970 --> 01:58:53.270
<v Speaker 3>like simultaneously.</v>

4071
01:58:55.640 --> 01:58:59.500
<v Speaker 3>And I imagined seeing it on some massive screen,</v>

4072
01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:01.960
<v Speaker 3>like seeing a million windows,</v>

4073
01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:05.080
<v Speaker 3>like if you had a massive computer screen with a million windows open,</v>

4074
01:59:05.110 --> 01:59:07.180
<v Speaker 3>just babies being born and people dying,</v>

4075
01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:10.210
<v Speaker 3>just seeing if he's getting a destroyed.</v>

4076
01:59:10.710 --> 01:59:11.830
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think of it that way.</v>

4077
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:13.410
<v Speaker 3>I thought of it the positive way.</v>

4078
01:59:13.411 --> 01:59:14.520
<v Speaker 3>So on the,</v>

4079
01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:15.070
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4080
01:59:15.070 --> 01:59:16.590
<v Speaker 3>the idea of this,</v>

4081
01:59:16.890 --> 01:59:21.040
<v Speaker 3>this giant super organism that's constantly expanding and contracting,</v>

4082
01:59:21.050 --> 01:59:22.150
<v Speaker 3>expanding and contracting.</v>

4083
01:59:22.151 --> 01:59:22.960
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

4084
01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:26.620
<v Speaker 3>most of the time now expanding more than contracting.</v>

4085
01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:28.690
<v Speaker 3>When you find out that the population,</v>

4086
01:59:28.691 --> 01:59:30.190
<v Speaker 3>number of the world,</v>

4087
01:59:30.250 --> 01:59:31.083
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

4088
01:59:31.390 --> 01:59:35.590
<v Speaker 3>I believe like in the 19 fifties it was only 2 billion in the world,</v>

4089
01:59:35.591 --> 01:59:36.424
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

4090
01:59:36.490 --> 01:59:37.360
<v Speaker 3>And now it's seven.</v>

4091
01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:38.020
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4092
01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:38.920
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking nuts.</v>

4093
01:59:38.921 --> 01:59:39.341
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

4094
01:59:39.341 --> 01:59:39.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4095
01:59:39.610 --> 01:59:40.271
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

4096
01:59:40.271 --> 01:59:44.910
<v Speaker 3>Like less than 100 years and it's $5 billion plus.</v>

4097
01:59:46.730 --> 01:59:47.590
<v Speaker 4>Well that's what I'm saying.</v>

4098
01:59:47.591 --> 01:59:47.801
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4099
01:59:47.801 --> 01:59:52.801
<v Speaker 4>So as stuff advances and people like me and people that were supposed to,</v>

4100
01:59:52.930 --> 01:59:55.120
<v Speaker 4>well not supposed to genetically would have died.</v>

4101
01:59:55.330 --> 01:59:55.840
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4102
01:59:55.840 --> 02:00:00.840
<v Speaker 4>Technology is going to have to advanced for food and space faster because</v>

4103
02:00:01.781 --> 02:00:02.920
<v Speaker 4>otherwise we're just going to die,</v>

4104
02:00:03.010 --> 02:00:03.920
<v Speaker 4>but it's not going to have it.</v>

4105
02:00:04.370 --> 02:00:05.260
<v Speaker 4>What the court.</v>

4106
02:00:05.890 --> 02:00:06.820
<v Speaker 4>You say just eat corn.</v>

4107
02:00:06.821 --> 02:00:07.061
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4108
02:00:07.061 --> 02:00:11.590
<v Speaker 4>What does that maybe to cast stella that eat corn if it's just corn left at the</v>

4109
02:00:11.591 --> 02:00:12.424
<v Speaker 4>end,</v>

4110
02:00:12.430 --> 02:00:13.540
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not supposed to.</v>

4111
02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:16.690
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 50.</v>

4112
02:00:16.691 --> 02:00:18.370
<v Speaker 3>There was only 2 billion people in the world.</v>

4113
02:00:18.371 --> 02:00:19.204
<v Speaker 3>That was what it was.</v>

4114
02:00:19.570 --> 02:00:20.620
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

4115
02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:21.553
<v Speaker 3>Blowing up.</v>

4116
02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:21.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4117
02:00:21.881 --> 02:00:22.631
<v Speaker 3>it was 2 billion.</v>

4118
02:00:22.631 --> 02:00:25.510
<v Speaker 3>Five hundred and $66,000 or 550.</v>

4119
02:00:25.511 --> 02:00:26.310
<v Speaker 3>$6,000.</v>

4120
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:27.143
<v Speaker 3>That's not.</v>

4121
02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:28.033
<v Speaker 4>And is it that.</v>

4122
02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:30.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to think how much of that has the Internet.</v>

4123
02:00:30.710 --> 02:00:31.543
<v Speaker 4>Mostly porn.</v>

4124
02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:33.530
<v Speaker 3>Well now it's 7 billion.</v>

4125
02:00:33.531 --> 02:00:33.771
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4126
02:00:33.771 --> 02:00:34.604
<v Speaker 3>but this is,</v>

4127
02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:37.430
<v Speaker 3>this was the world in 1950.</v>

4128
02:00:37.431 --> 02:00:38.780
<v Speaker 3>It was so much smaller.</v>

4129
02:00:38.810 --> 02:00:39.850
<v Speaker 3>There was so many.</v>

4130
02:00:40.190 --> 02:00:40.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4131
02:00:40.491 --> 02:00:42.650
<v Speaker 3>how many people were in America in 1950?</v>

4132
02:00:42.651 --> 02:00:43.484
<v Speaker 3>What do we say?</v>

4133
02:00:43.730 --> 02:00:44.690
<v Speaker 3>US population.</v>

4134
02:00:44.691 --> 02:00:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 50.</v>

4135
02:00:45.140 --> 02:00:45.973
<v Speaker 3>What did</v>

4136
02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:48.380
<v Speaker 3>you say?</v>

4137
02:00:48.380 --> 02:00:49.010
<v Speaker 3>Three.</v>

4138
02:00:49.010 --> 02:00:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Three something?</v>

4139
02:00:50.410 --> 02:00:51.243
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4140
02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:51.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4141
02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:52.280
<v Speaker 3>I'd say what?</v>

4142
02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:55.190
<v Speaker 3>Maybe let's go with $3,150 million.</v>

4143
02:00:55.460 --> 02:00:56.293
<v Speaker 3>A hundred 50.</v>

4144
02:00:56.660 --> 02:00:57.493
<v Speaker 3>Half.</v>

4145
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:58.730
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

4146
02:00:58.990 --> 02:00:59.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4147
02:00:59.120 --> 02:00:59.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think.</v>

4148
02:00:59.680 --> 02:00:59.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4149
02:00:59.951 --> 02:01:01.450
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what the United States.</v>

4150
02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:04.570
<v Speaker 4>You have the baby boom compared to other places,</v>

4151
02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:05.713
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4152
02:01:06.010 --> 02:01:06.701
<v Speaker 3>1940.</v>

4153
02:01:06.701 --> 02:01:07.840
<v Speaker 3>It was only 131.</v>

4154
02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:09.910
<v Speaker 3>As soon as they start figuring out medicine,</v>

4155
02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:11.140
<v Speaker 3>that's where it all went downhill.</v>

4156
02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:15.010
<v Speaker 3>No child left behind.</v>

4157
02:01:15.330 --> 02:01:17.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's also how you invent shit,</v>

4158
02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Ya know,</v>

4159
02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:20.920
<v Speaker 3>you have to have surplus and you have to have leisure.</v>

4160
02:01:21.130 --> 02:01:24.160
<v Speaker 3>You have to have people that have the ability to sit in front of computers and</v>

4161
02:01:24.161 --> 02:01:25.480
<v Speaker 3>desks and figure things out.</v>

4162
02:01:25.481 --> 02:01:26.314
<v Speaker 3>And that's where you,</v>

4163
02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:27.910
<v Speaker 3>without agriculture,</v>

4164
02:01:27.911 --> 02:01:31.240
<v Speaker 3>without cities and without civilization,</v>

4165
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4166
02:01:31.751 --> 02:01:33.060
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any inventions.</v>

4167
02:01:33.170 --> 02:01:35.920
<v Speaker 3>So all of it comes out of our ability to relax.</v>

4168
02:01:35.950 --> 02:01:36.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4169
02:01:36.130 --> 02:01:37.000
<v Speaker 3>we have the food,</v>

4170
02:01:37.001 --> 02:01:38.950
<v Speaker 3>we have a place where we can sleep.</v>

4171
02:01:39.290 --> 02:01:39.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

4172
02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:43.790
<v Speaker 3>let's relax and let's work on other stuff instead of hunting and gathering all</v>

4173
02:01:43.791 --> 02:01:44.181
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

4174
02:01:44.181 --> 02:01:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Let's try to figure out how to make a wheel.</v>

4175
02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:47.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4176
02:01:47.150 --> 02:01:51.830
<v Speaker 3>I think we can figure out a way to have a controlled explosion that powers and</v>

4177
02:01:51.890 --> 02:01:55.880
<v Speaker 3>engine and that engine can get us on a road and we can get places that we can't</v>

4178
02:01:55.881 --> 02:01:56.714
<v Speaker 3>get to by walking.</v>

4179
02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:57.110
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4180
02:01:57.110 --> 02:01:57.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4181
02:01:57.290 --> 02:01:58.700
<v Speaker 4>so I would be interested.</v>

4182
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.260
<v Speaker 4>So technology in general,</v>

4183
02:02:00.261 --> 02:02:00.561
<v Speaker 4>it's good.</v>

4184
02:02:00.561 --> 02:02:00.980
<v Speaker 4>We're all,</v>

4185
02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:02.870
<v Speaker 4>we're all going up at some point.</v>

4186
02:02:02.871 --> 02:02:05.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think it's very close with um,</v>

4187
02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:06.870
<v Speaker 4>with self driving cars and,</v>

4188
02:02:06.871 --> 02:02:08.600
<v Speaker 4>and just even computers in general,</v>

4189
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:11.910
<v Speaker 4>like they're gonna be a lot of people that they don't have.</v>

4190
02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:12.890
<v Speaker 4>They're not gonna have a job anymore.</v>

4191
02:02:12.891 --> 02:02:13.760
<v Speaker 4>They're like their,</v>

4192
02:02:13.761 --> 02:02:14.510
<v Speaker 4>their place,</v>

4193
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.751
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4194
02:02:14.751 --> 02:02:16.100
<v Speaker 4>If I think of my skill set,</v>

4195
02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:19.160
<v Speaker 4>I can be replaced for the most part by a computer.</v>

4196
02:02:19.161 --> 02:02:21.890
<v Speaker 4>Like you have all the people in the fast food industry.</v>

4197
02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:22.460
<v Speaker 4>I think like,</v>

4198
02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:22.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4199
02:02:22.670 --> 02:02:26.930
<v Speaker 4>they've been going out saying they want $15 an hour in New York.</v>

4200
02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:28.670
<v Speaker 4>At the end of the day,</v>

4201
02:02:28.671 --> 02:02:30.020
<v Speaker 4>if you own that business,</v>

4202
02:02:30.050 --> 02:02:32.420
<v Speaker 4>technology isn't a place where all those front,</v>

4203
02:02:32.790 --> 02:02:33.770
<v Speaker 4>the people in the front,</v>

4204
02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:35.320
<v Speaker 4>you don't need you.</v>

4205
02:02:35.380 --> 02:02:36.920
<v Speaker 4>You just have like a kiosk.</v>

4206
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:37.570
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4207
02:02:37.570 --> 02:02:38.620
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that the case?</v>

4208
02:02:38.621 --> 02:02:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Like always like if do we need blacksmiths to have jobs?</v>

4209
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:44.080
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4210
02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:44.621
<v Speaker 3>Should we play?</v>

4211
02:02:44.621 --> 02:02:44.891
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4212
02:02:44.891 --> 02:02:46.090
<v Speaker 3>we without the horses,</v>

4213
02:02:46.091 --> 02:02:47.020
<v Speaker 3>what do I do?</v>

4214
02:02:47.410 --> 02:02:49.240
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you need to come up with a new thing to do,</v>

4215
02:02:49.241 --> 02:02:51.940
<v Speaker 3>but if we're going to run out of shit to do and then just go to twitter and like</v>

4216
02:02:51.941 --> 02:02:53.950
<v Speaker 3>give you shit with entire day.</v>

4217
02:02:54.490 --> 02:02:55.001
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

4218
02:02:55.001 --> 02:02:58.750
<v Speaker 3>All those people that are running out of shit to do a probably if they found a</v>

4219
02:02:58.751 --> 02:03:01.600
<v Speaker 3>thing they enjoyed would have some other thing that they can do.</v>

4220
02:03:01.650 --> 02:03:02.050
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4221
02:03:02.050 --> 02:03:07.050
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's kind of crazy to think of progress as taking away jobs.</v>

4222
02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:08.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4223
02:03:08.461 --> 02:03:08.720
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

4224
02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:09.870
<v Speaker 4>but that's the argument.</v>

4225
02:03:09.871 --> 02:03:10.810
<v Speaker 4>So many times the.</v>

4226
02:03:10.811 --> 02:03:12.210
<v Speaker 4>If you look at like the trucking industry,</v>

4227
02:03:12.410 --> 02:03:13.210
<v Speaker 4>if you look at,</v>

4228
02:03:13.210 --> 02:03:16.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean right now the big one is Uber,</v>

4229
02:03:16.270 --> 02:03:17.103
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4230
02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:18.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's not even automated cars.</v>

4231
02:03:18.811 --> 02:03:21.450
<v Speaker 4>That's just convenience and everyone's like,</v>

4232
02:03:21.451 --> 02:03:22.260
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4233
02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:22.771
<v Speaker 4>we can't.</v>

4234
02:03:22.771 --> 02:03:23.110
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

4235
02:03:23.110 --> 02:03:25.050
<v Speaker 4>we have something that's already established,</v>

4236
02:03:25.051 --> 02:03:29.160
<v Speaker 4>a track sheet community is upset and so and those guys,</v>

4237
02:03:29.161 --> 02:03:33.660
<v Speaker 4>I bet those guys are the guys that are sharing any terrible uber story.</v>

4238
02:03:33.870 --> 02:03:34.710
<v Speaker 4>Uber's everywhere.</v>

4239
02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:38.610
<v Speaker 4>Uber's worth $41,000,000,000 and none incredible right quick.</v>

4240
02:03:38.611 --> 02:03:39.090
<v Speaker 4>That happened.</v>

4241
02:03:39.090 --> 02:03:40.140
<v Speaker 4>There were two instances,</v>

4242
02:03:40.170 --> 02:03:45.060
<v Speaker 4>instances of something happening and everyone's like Uber's shit on in India,</v>

4243
02:03:45.061 --> 02:03:45.894
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4244
02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:46.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4245
02:03:46.770 --> 02:03:47.221
<v Speaker 4>There was a,</v>

4246
02:03:47.221 --> 02:03:47.700
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>

4247
02:03:47.700 --> 02:03:49.290
<v Speaker 4>there was a rape accusation there,</v>

4248
02:03:49.291 --> 02:03:50.130
<v Speaker 4>there was also.</v>

4249
02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:53.750
<v Speaker 4>And so I think it's good to those stories come out because it background checks</v>

4250
02:03:53.751 --> 02:03:54.584
<v Speaker 4>super important.</v>

4251
02:03:54.990 --> 02:03:56.880
<v Speaker 4>Obviously a huge.</v>

4252
02:03:57.090 --> 02:04:00.540
<v Speaker 4>Someone's driving you around in a metal box and then there was a,</v>

4253
02:04:00.541 --> 02:04:04.020
<v Speaker 4>I think there was also another one where a guy that had been convicted or</v>

4254
02:04:04.021 --> 02:04:05.700
<v Speaker 4>charged with a violent crime killed someone.</v>

4255
02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:09.520
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't there one where a guy like took someone somewhere and wouldn't let him</v>

4256
02:04:09.521 --> 02:04:10.090
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

4257
02:04:10.090 --> 02:04:14.020
<v Speaker 3>like protect them to some abandoned warehouse or some shit or something that was</v>

4258
02:04:14.021 --> 02:04:14.854
<v Speaker 3>an American thing.</v>

4259
02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:15.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4260
02:04:15.610 --> 02:04:17.140
<v Speaker 3>Took them to a parking lot or something.</v>

4261
02:04:18.110 --> 02:04:21.680
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you might be thinking of fake taxi as a fake tax.</v>

4262
02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:22.761
<v Speaker 4>Don't Google it.</v>

4263
02:04:22.761 --> 02:04:23.470
<v Speaker 4>It's okay.</v>

4264
02:04:23.470 --> 02:04:24.303
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4265
02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:25.210
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

4266
02:04:25.210 --> 02:04:25.790
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4267
02:04:25.790 --> 02:04:26.990
<v Speaker 4>but I also at the same time,</v>

4268
02:04:26.991 --> 02:04:28.130
<v Speaker 4>anytime I hear those stories,</v>

4269
02:04:28.131 --> 02:04:32.510
<v Speaker 4>I think of every drunk friend I have that's yelled at or done something wrong to</v>

4270
02:04:32.511 --> 02:04:33.344
<v Speaker 4>an uber driver.</v>

4271
02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:34.233
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

4272
02:04:34.370 --> 02:04:35.410
<v Speaker 4>maybe it,</v>

4273
02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:36.141
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4274
02:04:36.141 --> 02:04:37.040
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of shit.</v>

4275
02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:38.760
<v Speaker 4>It's not the India situation,</v>

4276
02:04:38.761 --> 02:04:40.170
<v Speaker 4>but obviously like the,</v>

4277
02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:41.070
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4278
02:04:41.070 --> 02:04:41.691
<v Speaker 4>there was a,</v>

4279
02:04:41.691 --> 02:04:41.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4280
02:04:41.850 --> 02:04:45.030
<v Speaker 4>words that turned into fists really with Uber Drivers.</v>

4281
02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:45.331
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4282
02:04:45.331 --> 02:04:45.481
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4283
02:04:45.481 --> 02:04:46.081
<v Speaker 4>with the story.</v>

4284
02:04:46.081 --> 02:04:46.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm just like,</v>

4285
02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:47.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4286
02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:48.510
<v Speaker 4>there've been those small instances,</v>

4287
02:04:48.570 --> 02:04:50.070
<v Speaker 4>but it's not widespread.</v>

4288
02:04:50.071 --> 02:04:51.120
<v Speaker 4>I think for me,</v>

4289
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:53.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if the guy that owns uber's a huge asshole,</v>

4290
02:04:53.731 --> 02:04:54.720
<v Speaker 4>all I know is it's convenient.</v>

4291
02:04:54.850 --> 02:04:55.100
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4292
02:04:55.100 --> 02:04:58.740
<v Speaker 4>And it's forcing the taxi companies to change where they come out with like</v>

4293
02:04:58.741 --> 02:04:59.551
<v Speaker 4>their versions,</v>

4294
02:04:59.551 --> 02:05:00.870
<v Speaker 4>which I still don't use,</v>

4295
02:05:00.871 --> 02:05:01.740
<v Speaker 4>but I think,</v>

4296
02:05:01.770 --> 02:05:02.730
<v Speaker 4>I think it just makes sense.</v>

4297
02:05:02.731 --> 02:05:04.380
<v Speaker 4>Like let's keep doing more and more and more.</v>

4298
02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:05.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4299
02:05:05.111 --> 02:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4300
02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:07.150
<v Speaker 1>well they're very friendly,</v>

4301
02:05:07.330 --> 02:05:07.541
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4302
02:05:07.541 --> 02:05:09.130
<v Speaker 1>especially Uber in New York City,</v>

4303
02:05:09.131 --> 02:05:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I found them to be much more friendly than calves.</v>

4304
02:05:11.341 --> 02:05:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Calves are just like,</v>

4305
02:05:12.191 --> 02:05:12.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4306
02:05:12.551 --> 02:05:13.540
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

4307
02:05:13.810 --> 02:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>that you need them.</v>

4308
02:05:14.741 --> 02:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>They know you need them and sometimes they're shitheads a lot of times they're</v>

4309
02:05:17.861 --> 02:05:18.221
<v Speaker 1>friendly,</v>

4310
02:05:18.221 --> 02:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>but the uber drivers were like across the board,</v>

4311
02:05:20.891 --> 02:05:25.570
<v Speaker 1>friendly almost because it's this new thing and they also want you to give them</v>

4312
02:05:25.571 --> 02:05:26.201
<v Speaker 1>stars,</v>

4313
02:05:26.201 --> 02:05:26.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4314
02:05:26.411 --> 02:05:26.740
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

4315
02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:28.530
<v Speaker 1>they'll want you to rate them and they,</v>

4316
02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>if they were rated highly than people,</v>

4317
02:05:29.981 --> 02:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>get excited about that person picking them up and then I'll also tip them as</v>

4318
02:05:34.181 --> 02:05:35.630
<v Speaker 1>well as you know,</v>

4319
02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:36.020
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4320
02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:38.410
<v Speaker 1>the money that they get from the little,</v>

4321
02:05:39.070 --> 02:05:39.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4322
02:05:39.330 --> 02:05:39.600
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4323
02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:41.500
<v Speaker 1>the application where your credit cards in there.</v>

4324
02:05:41.770 --> 02:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>They get a percentage of that.</v>

4325
02:05:42.611 --> 02:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4326
02:05:42.970 --> 02:05:43.803
<v Speaker 1>It's like something.</v>

4327
02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:45.011
<v Speaker 4>I forgot what the,</v>

4328
02:05:45.011 --> 02:05:46.210
<v Speaker 4>I forgot what the split is.</v>

4329
02:05:46.211 --> 02:05:47.044
<v Speaker 4>I know that</v>

4330
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:52.420
<v Speaker 4>I knew a guy that was part of that watch my show that was an uber x driver and I</v>

4331
02:05:52.421 --> 02:05:55.060
<v Speaker 4>think they get a similar rate or something slightly different,</v>

4332
02:05:56.080 --> 02:05:56.471
<v Speaker 4>but those,</v>

4333
02:05:56.471 --> 02:05:57.970
<v Speaker 4>I think those weird me out a little more.</v>

4334
02:05:58.300 --> 02:05:59.170
<v Speaker 4>Uber X is weird.</v>

4335
02:05:59.190 --> 02:05:59.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4336
02:05:59.290 --> 02:06:01.390
<v Speaker 4>that's a car that's like someone's just car.</v>

4337
02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:03.880
<v Speaker 4>Someone rolls up in a cube and then get in and I'm like,</v>

4338
02:06:05.090 --> 02:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy picked somebody up here in a Prius,</v>

4339
02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:10.580
<v Speaker 1>in a certain room or a volt was like a volt was a fake.</v>

4340
02:06:11.190 --> 02:06:12.510
<v Speaker 4>This is way better though,</v>

4341
02:06:12.570 --> 02:06:13.200
<v Speaker 4>is it?</v>

4342
02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:16.740
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately my girlfriend uses lyft and I don't think that they have the same</v>

4343
02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:18.180
<v Speaker 4>quality control.</v>

4344
02:06:18.181 --> 02:06:20.500
<v Speaker 4>And as Uber this guy came in with windows.</v>

4345
02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:20.820
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

4346
02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:23.910
<v Speaker 4>F 10 pickup trucks with the big pickup back in a,</v>

4347
02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:24.753
<v Speaker 4>in a cab.</v>

4348
02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:25.321
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4349
02:06:25.321 --> 02:06:27.810
<v Speaker 4>like what construction workers she gets.</v>

4350
02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:28.741
<v Speaker 4>We both get in.</v>

4351
02:06:28.741 --> 02:06:28.981
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4352
02:06:28.981 --> 02:06:30.930
<v Speaker 4>why did you call an uber or why didn't you call Uber?</v>

4353
02:06:30.931 --> 02:06:31.764
<v Speaker 4>I get in,</v>

4354
02:06:31.770 --> 02:06:35.310
<v Speaker 4>there's a shovel in the back of his truck.</v>

4355
02:06:36.750 --> 02:06:41.220
<v Speaker 4>The guy seemed like flustered that I was there because I think he just saw my</v>

4356
02:06:41.221 --> 02:06:43.710
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend's profile pic was corrupt.</v>

4357
02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:44.580
<v Speaker 4>So then he,</v>

4358
02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:46.110
<v Speaker 4>he fakes a phone call.</v>

4359
02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:47.820
<v Speaker 4>Jamie was watching me the whole time.</v>

4360
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:51.960
<v Speaker 4>He fakes a phone call and starts yelling at somebody and we're just like,</v>

4361
02:06:51.961 --> 02:06:54.360
<v Speaker 4>what are we doing in this is not driving.</v>

4362
02:06:54.361 --> 02:06:54.901
<v Speaker 4>He's just sitting there.</v>

4363
02:06:54.901 --> 02:06:55.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4364
02:06:55.540 --> 02:06:55.850
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4365
02:06:55.850 --> 02:06:56.270
<v Speaker 4>uh.</v>

<v Speaker 4>So we get out.</v>

4367
02:06:57.060 --> 02:06:59.100
<v Speaker 4>He's Jamie's outside taking photos.</v>

4368
02:06:59.101 --> 02:07:01.410
<v Speaker 4>Because he thinks that it looks something's not right,</v>

4369
02:07:01.770 --> 02:07:04.020
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like thinking my girlfriend wasn't.</v>

4370
02:07:04.110 --> 02:07:05.490
<v Speaker 4>If I wasn't with my girlfriend,</v>

4371
02:07:05.491 --> 02:07:09.240
<v Speaker 4>she would have got in this weird car with a shovel in the back and he,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know what the fuck?</v>

4385
02:07:22.921 --> 02:07:23.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he was messing around,</v>

4386
02:07:23.971 --> 02:07:24.440
<v Speaker 4>but he was like,</v>

02:07:50.381 --> 02:07:51.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4410

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4412

<v Speaker 5>you could have your own shifts in a way.</v>

4413
02:07:54.311 --> 02:07:55.510
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of cool if,</v>

4414
02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:58.110
<v Speaker 5>if they have real background checks,</v>

4415
02:07:58.160 --> 02:08:01.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean if they really make sure you have no mental health issues,</v>

02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:29.801
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4435
02:08:29.801 --> 02:08:30.730

<v Speaker 5>These self driving cars.</v>

4439
02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:34.330
<v Speaker 5>It's awesome.</v>

4440
02:08:34.330 --> 02:08:35.081
<v Speaker 5>That's fascinating.</v>

4441
02:08:35.081 --> 02:08:35.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4442
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:37.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think there was something recently where they,</v>

4443
02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:38.920
<v Speaker 5>they're not the best in the rain right now,</v>

4444
02:08:38.921 --> 02:08:40.000
<v Speaker 5>but it's still early tech.</v>

4445
02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:40.930
<v Speaker 5>Oh look,</v>

4446
02:08:40.930 --> 02:08:42.220
<v Speaker 5>they don't the breaking,</v>

4447
02:08:42.250 --> 02:08:46.180
<v Speaker 5>they don't think it's something with the way that it perceives like the outside</v>

4448
02:08:46.181 --> 02:08:46.850
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

4449
02:08:46.850 --> 02:08:51.670
<v Speaker 5>a slippery traction things on those lines because they always ended up having</v>

4450
02:08:51.671 --> 02:08:51.911
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

4451
02:08:51.911 --> 02:08:54.580
<v Speaker 5>these articles and stories where they talk about things like I don't think about</v>

4452
02:08:54.581 --> 02:08:55.414
<v Speaker 5>like uh,</v>

4453
02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:56.320
<v Speaker 5>people on bicycles,</v>

4454
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:56.621
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4455
02:08:56.621 --> 02:08:59.860
<v Speaker 5>things that don't look like cars and I don't know,</v>

4456
02:08:59.861 --> 02:09:01.150
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's baby steps.</v>

4457
02:09:01.390 --> 02:09:02.620
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to be there tomorrow,</v>

4458
02:09:02.621 --> 02:09:03.880
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's awesome.</v>

4459
02:09:03.881 --> 02:09:04.370
<v Speaker 5>I think you,</v>

4460
02:09:04.370 --> 02:09:04.580
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

4461
02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:04.910
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

4462
02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:08.260
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about once again more people surviving because you were a car</v>

4463
02:09:08.261 --> 02:09:08.710
<v Speaker 5>accident.</v>

4464
02:09:08.710 --> 02:09:13.570
<v Speaker 5>If you can have some sort of system that can be thrown into an old car,</v>

4465
02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:14.141
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4466
02:09:14.141 --> 02:09:14.560
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

4467
02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:16.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying make it mandatory because I like,</v>

4468
02:09:16.930 --> 02:09:18.160
<v Speaker 5>I love driving my car.</v>

4469
02:09:18.190 --> 02:09:19.330
<v Speaker 5>Like it gets me excited.</v>

02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.650
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

4479
02:09:29.650 --> 02:09:30.483
<v Speaker 5>That's not necessarily.</v>

4480
02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:31.833
<v Speaker 5>How much is it though?</v>

4481
02:09:32.170 --> 02:09:33.130
<v Speaker 5>It's not that expensive.</v>

4482
02:09:33.190 --> 02:09:34.630
<v Speaker 5>It's like $65,000.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's 700 horsepower car with a warranty.</v>

4484
02:09:39.140 --> 02:09:42.670
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing and it's really comfortable to drive.</v>

4485
02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:44.740
<v Speaker 5>We drove around for a few days in Denver.</v>

4486
02:09:44.741 --> 02:09:45.521
<v Speaker 5>It's really nice.</v>

4487
02:09:45.521 --> 02:09:45.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4488
02:09:45.940 --> 02:09:46.630
<v Speaker 5>I uh,</v>

4489
02:09:46.630 --> 02:09:46.870
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

4490
02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:48.220
<v Speaker 5>Before that I had a,</v>

4491
02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:49.390
<v Speaker 5>it was like an rx eight.</v>

4492
02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:52.480
<v Speaker 5>It was like a Mazda rx eight and it's just like this little little tiny car.</v>

4493
02:09:52.481 --> 02:09:57.100
<v Speaker 5>And then I got into that and it's one Mercedes has this new s class,</v>

4494
02:09:57.101 --> 02:09:58.010
<v Speaker 5>the [inaudible],</v>

4495
02:09:58.070 --> 02:10:02.350
<v Speaker 5>another big luxury sedan that drives itself up to 30 miles.</v>

4496
02:10:02.351 --> 02:10:04.690
<v Speaker 5>An hour like stays in lanes,</v>

4497
02:10:04.691 --> 02:10:05.740
<v Speaker 5>makes turns,</v>

4498
02:10:05.770 --> 02:10:06.640
<v Speaker 5>it reads,</v>

4499
02:10:06.730 --> 02:10:07.810
<v Speaker 5>it reads speed,</v>

4500
02:10:07.811 --> 02:10:10.540
<v Speaker 5>limit signs and will follow the speed limits.</v>

4501
02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:11.230
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

4502
02:10:11.230 --> 02:10:12.670
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking crazy.</v>

4503
02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:13.270
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome.</v>

4504
02:10:13.270 --> 02:10:13.810
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>

4505
02:10:13.810 --> 02:10:17.650
<v Speaker 5>it's good to about 30 miles an hour where you set this?</v>

4506
02:10:18.270 --> 02:10:19.031
<v Speaker 5>The sensors?</v>

4507
02:10:19.031 --> 02:10:19.161
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

4508
02:10:19.161 --> 02:10:23.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't know all the tech but it breaks when cars are in front of you,</v>

4509
02:10:23.291 --> 02:10:25.300
<v Speaker 5>slows down when traffic slows down,</v>

4510
02:10:25.301 --> 02:10:26.134
<v Speaker 5>speeds up.</v>

4511
02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:29.010
<v Speaker 5>So like around town you were essentially could be like just,</v>

4512
02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:29.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4513
02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:33.320
<v Speaker 5>hands in your pants and this thing's driving 30 miles an hour.</v>

4514
02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 5>This fucking</v>

4515
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:34.600
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

4516
02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:35.271
<v Speaker 3>Where are you rolling?</v>

4517
02:10:35.271 --> 02:10:38.780
<v Speaker 3>Thirty miles an hour with your hands down your pants everywhere.</v>

4518
02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:39.920
<v Speaker 3>If I could.</v>

4519
02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:40.101
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4520
02:10:40.101 --> 02:10:41.600
<v Speaker 3>especially because it has a screen,</v>

4521
02:10:41.630 --> 02:10:43.480
<v Speaker 3>it has these giant LCD screens,</v>

4522
02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:45.470
<v Speaker 3>these 2:12 inch lcd screens.</v>

4523
02:10:45.471 --> 02:10:48.110
<v Speaker 3>The speedometer is a 12 inch LCD screen.</v>

4524
02:10:48.230 --> 02:10:49.160
<v Speaker 3>All your gauges,</v>

4525
02:10:49.161 --> 02:10:51.890
<v Speaker 3>your gauge cluster is all an lcd screen and you're.</v>

4526
02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:53.180
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking nap screen.</v>

4527
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:56.060
<v Speaker 3>Ian Edwards and I rented one when we were in DC.</v>

4528
02:10:56.300 --> 02:10:57.100
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

4529
02:10:57.100 --> 02:11:02.100
<v Speaker 3>they are so slick and the all your navigation system is huge.</v>

4530
02:11:02.541 --> 02:11:06.710
<v Speaker 3>It's 12 inches enormous and you could watch movies on it.</v>

4531
02:11:07.730 --> 02:11:08.930
<v Speaker 3>The way it's set up,</v>

4532
02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:12.530
<v Speaker 3>only the pasture can see the movie like when the car is moving,</v>

4533
02:11:12.650 --> 02:11:14.180
<v Speaker 3>but when you're parked you can see it.</v>

4534
02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:18.590
<v Speaker 3>Say That's the thing that annoys me the most is when like my gps that's built in</v>

4535
02:11:18.591 --> 02:11:21.890
<v Speaker 3>treats me like a child and I can't answer that and anything in rides.</v>

4538
02:11:25.610 --> 02:11:28.400
<v Speaker 3>I liked that you spin the wheel and you enter into it.</v>

4539
02:11:29.330 --> 02:11:32.300
<v Speaker 3>Mercedes is like a little more goofy.</v>

4540
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:33.081
<v Speaker 3>The interface,</v>

4541
02:11:33.081 --> 02:11:34.160
<v Speaker 3>like the wheel,</v>

4542

<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4551
02:11:43.191 --> 02:11:44.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean it just floats over.</v>

4552
02:11:44.391 --> 02:11:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Potholes and everything.</v>

4553
02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:47.180
<v Speaker 3>It's super comfortable inside,</v>

4554
02:11:48.050 --> 02:11:50.270
<v Speaker 3>but that technology is,</v>

4555
02:11:50.330 --> 02:11:52.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is like baby steps.</v>

4556
02:11:52.191 --> 02:11:56.180
<v Speaker 3>It's allowing you to essentially keep your hands off the wheel up to about 30</v>

4557
02:11:56.181 --> 02:11:56.811
<v Speaker 3>miles an hour.</v>

4558
02:11:56.811 --> 02:11:58.580
<v Speaker 3>They don't recommend you take your hands off the wheel,</v>

4559
02:11:58.581 --> 02:12:03.350
<v Speaker 3>but essentially it really does drive itself and there's some videos of guys</v>

4560
02:12:03.351 --> 02:12:06.350
<v Speaker 3>trying and working on it and it really does work.</v>

4561
02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:07.550
<v Speaker 3>That's so interesting.</v>

4562
02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:12.140
<v Speaker 3>But you have to have a clearly defined lines on the road because it goes by</v>

4563
02:12:12.141 --> 02:12:16.860
<v Speaker 3>cameras and the cameras interpret what it's seeing and it figures out how to</v>

4564
02:12:16.861 --> 02:12:17.810
<v Speaker 3>steer and drive.</v>

4565
02:12:17.810 --> 02:12:18.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4566
02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:18.351
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4567
02:12:18.351 --> 02:12:18.680
<v Speaker 3>if there's,</v>

4568
02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:19.491
<v Speaker 3>if that's already a thing,</v>

4569
02:12:19.491 --> 02:12:19.701
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4570
02:12:19.701 --> 02:12:21.820
<v Speaker 3>It's processors get faster and cameras can do it.</v>

4571
02:12:21.821 --> 02:12:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Go higher frames per second.</v>

4572
02:12:23.001 --> 02:12:25.250
<v Speaker 3>Like I wonder when that can go like 70.</v>

4573
02:12:25.490 --> 02:12:26.323
<v Speaker 3>It's going to happen.</v>

4574
02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:27.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a matter of time.</v>

4575
02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:27.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4576
02:12:27.610 --> 02:12:29.030
<v Speaker 3>how fast can the Google cargo?</v>

4577
02:12:29.180 --> 02:12:29.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4578
02:12:29.460 --> 02:12:30.230
<v Speaker 3>I think it's 30,</v>

4579
02:12:30.230 --> 02:12:31.340
<v Speaker 3>so I think it's around the same range.</v>

4580
02:12:31.370 --> 02:12:32.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

4581
02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:33.170
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know it was that week.</v>

4582
02:12:33.220 --> 02:12:33.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4583
02:12:33.590 --> 02:12:35.570
<v Speaker 3>not that we're getting on the highway with those because if you sound like the</v>

4584
02:12:35.571 --> 02:12:37.100
<v Speaker 3>newest one that doesn't have a steering wheel,</v>

4585
02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:40.720
<v Speaker 3>like it's just you saying that that's crazy.</v>

4586
02:12:40.770 --> 02:12:41.660
<v Speaker 3>Like good luck.</v>

4587
02:12:41.690 --> 02:12:41.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4588
02:12:41.871 --> 02:12:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Because it seems like you should have a steering wheel.</v>

4589
02:12:44.090 --> 02:12:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Like it seems like it should be.</v>

4590
02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:50.860
<v Speaker 3>At least now it should be like just sort of some sort of an extra thing like not</v>

4591
02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:52.940
<v Speaker 3>mean what the fuck.</v>

4592
02:12:52.941 --> 02:12:53.840
<v Speaker 3>What if it breaks,</v>

4593
02:12:54.170 --> 02:12:54.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4594
02:12:54.681 --> 02:12:55.400
<v Speaker 3>and you're driving.</v>

4595
02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:55.550
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4596
02:12:55.550 --> 02:12:56.050
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

4597
02:12:56.050 --> 02:12:59.210
<v Speaker 3>and there's no steering wheel going straight towards the school.</v>

4598
02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.960
<v Speaker 3>It reads,</v>

4599
02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:02.990
<v Speaker 3>it reads a speed limit sign is like $200 or something like that.</v>

4600
02:13:03.890 --> 02:13:04.723
<v Speaker 3>Let's do this.</v>

4601
02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:05.121
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4602
02:13:05.121 --> 02:13:05.954
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even think of that.</v>

4603
02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:07.080
<v Speaker 3>Fake speed signs.</v>

4604
02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:09.420
<v Speaker 3>The newest hack.</v>

4605
02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:14.330
<v Speaker 3>Well you can hack things like I was talking about the screen in the car.</v>

4606
02:13:14.331 --> 02:13:17.330
<v Speaker 3>What I meant was you could drive 30 miles an hour and just beat off to porn as</v>

4607
02:13:17.331 --> 02:13:21.890
<v Speaker 3>you're driving because I used to have an infinity and I had this guy rick a</v>

4608
02:13:21.891 --> 02:13:22.730
<v Speaker 3>switch it out,</v>

4609
02:13:22.731 --> 02:13:24.730
<v Speaker 3>a DVD player and uh,</v>

4610
02:13:24.731 --> 02:13:28.310
<v Speaker 3>I had this guy rick a switched so that it thinks that the parking brake is on,</v>

4611
02:13:28.311 --> 02:13:29.360
<v Speaker 3>so it thinks you're in park,</v>

4612
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:32.520
<v Speaker 3>so we just press the switch and you could watch movies while you're driving.</v>

4613
02:13:32.521 --> 02:13:33.354
<v Speaker 3>You remember that car?</v>

4614
02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:33.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4615
02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:36.690
<v Speaker 3>I was watching Bruce Lee movies when I was on my way to the comedy store.</v>

4616
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:37.890
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really watch them.</v>

4617
02:13:37.891 --> 02:13:39.890
<v Speaker 3>I paid attention to the road and responsible adults,</v>

4618
02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:41.980
<v Speaker 3>but I liked the fact that it was there.</v>

4619
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:44.310
<v Speaker 3>And a cop actually pulled me over and he said,</v>

4620
02:13:44.311 --> 02:13:44.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4621
02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:44.791
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4622
02:13:44.791 --> 02:13:45.210
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

4623
02:13:45.210 --> 02:13:47.010
<v Speaker 3>you can't have that a plane while you drive.</v>

4624
02:13:47.011 --> 02:13:47.191
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

4625
02:13:47.191 --> 02:13:47.431
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

4626
02:13:47.431 --> 02:13:48.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what's going on with this.</v>

4627
02:13:48.930 --> 02:13:50.070
<v Speaker 3>It's not supposed to do this.</v>

4628
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:50.821
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4629
02:13:50.821 --> 02:13:51.430
<v Speaker 3>Just ask.</v>

4630
02:13:51.430 --> 02:13:52.590
<v Speaker 3>Just being the backseat.</v>

4631
02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Shit's not working.</v>

4632
02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:54.030
<v Speaker 3>Sun.</v>

4633
02:13:54.030 --> 02:13:54.960
<v Speaker 3>The thing won't stop playing.</v>

4634
02:13:54.961 --> 02:13:55.681
<v Speaker 3>Bruce Lee movies,</v>

4635
02:13:55.681 --> 02:13:56.460
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4636
02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:58.020
<v Speaker 3>Most cops don't know shit about tech.</v>

4637
02:13:58.021 --> 02:13:58.854
<v Speaker 3>So you can get away with,</v>

4638
02:13:59.610 --> 02:14:00.930
<v Speaker 3>get away with lying to him about that.</v>

4639
02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:01.881
<v Speaker 4>I'm terrible with that.</v>

4640
02:14:01.881 --> 02:14:03.990
<v Speaker 4>Like as soon as I see a cop pulled me over,</v>

4641
02:14:03.991 --> 02:14:04.461
<v Speaker 4>I'm just like,</v>

4642
02:14:04.461 --> 02:14:05.120
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

4643
02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:05.581
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even gonna.</v>

4644
02:14:05.581 --> 02:14:06.720
<v Speaker 4>Try and talk my way out of this.</v>

4645
02:14:06.721 --> 02:14:07.554
<v Speaker 4>I'm terrified.</v>

4646
02:14:07.810 --> 02:14:08.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4647
02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:13.470
<v Speaker 3>One thing I don't ever do is I don't ever allow a weed to get into my car inside</v>

4648
02:14:15.731 --> 02:14:16.420
<v Speaker 3>my car.</v>

4649
02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:16.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4650
02:14:16.721 --> 02:14:19.160
<v Speaker 3>because you see it smells weeds.</v>

4651
02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:22.960
<v Speaker 3>The weird thing about weed is when you're smoking weed,</v>

4652
02:14:22.990 --> 02:14:24.400
<v Speaker 3>you don't smell it.</v>

4653
02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:25.840
<v Speaker 3>You're smoking it.</v>

4654
02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:27.130
<v Speaker 3>But people around you like,</v>

4655
02:14:27.190 --> 02:14:27.941
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>

4656
02:14:27.941 --> 02:14:29.410
<v Speaker 3>that's some fucking stinky weed.</v>

4657
02:14:29.550 --> 02:14:29.861
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

4658
02:14:29.861 --> 02:14:30.694
<v Speaker 3>I don't smell shit.</v>

4659
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:31.720
<v Speaker 3>It's strange.</v>

4660
02:14:31.721 --> 02:14:35.920
<v Speaker 3>Like friends will come over and they'll stink of weed and they don't even know</v>

4661
02:14:35.921 --> 02:14:36.870
<v Speaker 3>they stink of which</v>

4662
02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:39.713
<v Speaker 3>stinks of weed.</v>

4663
02:14:39.750 --> 02:14:40.583
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

4664
02:14:41.050 --> 02:14:41.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4665
02:14:41.710 --> 02:14:45.760
<v Speaker 4>See that's something like talking to people and then hearing their stories where</v>

4666
02:14:45.761 --> 02:14:46.960
<v Speaker 4>they like bring stuff.</v>

4667
02:14:47.180 --> 02:14:47.381
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4668
02:14:47.381 --> 02:14:48.214
<v Speaker 4>you're crazy.</v>

4669
02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:49.031
<v Speaker 4>You're a crazy person.</v>

4670
02:14:49.031 --> 02:14:50.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't care how easy it is.</v>

4671
02:14:50.290 --> 02:14:51.123
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to get.</v>

4672
02:14:51.130 --> 02:14:51.231
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4673
02:14:51.231 --> 02:14:52.660
<v Speaker 4>you crazy to travel with it.</v>

4674
02:14:52.661 --> 02:14:53.340
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

4675
02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:55.840
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying is like when you're there,</v>

4676
02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:56.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4677
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:59.080
<v Speaker 4>like when I talked to people that are all about it,</v>

4678
02:14:59.081 --> 02:15:01.630
<v Speaker 4>they give me these 80 step plans and I'm like,</v>

4679
02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:04.360
<v Speaker 4>or you go a day without it.</v>

4680
02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:06.700
<v Speaker 4>That could be cool too.</v>

4681
02:15:07.150 --> 02:15:08.620
<v Speaker 4>It's not that big of a deal.</v>

4682
02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:11.500
<v Speaker 4>The man tired of the man tried to take away my.</v>

4683
02:15:11.501 --> 02:15:12.750
<v Speaker 4>We'd like if you want to,</v>

4684
02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:14.630
<v Speaker 4>if you want to talk about the TSA being like,</v>

4685
02:15:14.860 --> 02:15:15.671
<v Speaker 4>like bad.</v>

4686
02:15:15.671 --> 02:15:15.971
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4687
02:15:15.971 --> 02:15:16.570
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

4688
02:15:16.570 --> 02:15:16.871
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4689
02:15:16.871 --> 02:15:17.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4690
02:15:17.170 --> 02:15:18.670
<v Speaker 4>but fucking don't,</v>

4691
02:15:18.671 --> 02:15:21.190
<v Speaker 4>don't go over state lines with something illegal.</v>

4692
02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:24.720
<v Speaker 3>So stupid because in some places it's really illegal.</v>

4693
02:15:24.721 --> 02:15:25.620
<v Speaker 3>Like Texas,</v>

4694
02:15:25.890 --> 02:15:27.240
<v Speaker 3>if you get busted in Texas,</v>

4695
02:15:27.241 --> 02:15:29.130
<v Speaker 3>that is really fucking illegal.</v>

4696
02:15:29.131 --> 02:15:30.030
<v Speaker 3>That's something that's a little.</v>

4697
02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:31.620
<v Speaker 3>There have a little while.</v>

4698
02:15:31.621 --> 02:15:33.480
<v Speaker 3>You see Congress passed this new,</v>

4699
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4700
02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:35.870
<v Speaker 3>this new approach to medical marijuana there.</v>

4701
02:15:35.871 --> 02:15:38.730
<v Speaker 3>They're not attacking medical marijuana at all anymore.</v>

4702
02:15:38.910 --> 02:15:40.860
<v Speaker 3>They've quietly done this over the last few days.</v>

4703
02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:44.580
<v Speaker 3>There are no longer gonna prosecute states or anybody that's involved in medical</v>

4704
02:15:44.581 --> 02:15:45.001
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>

4705
02:15:45.001 --> 02:15:47.280
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna allow states to do what they're doing,</v>

4706
02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:48.173
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>

4707
02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:49.050
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

4708
02:15:49.050 --> 02:15:49.830
<v Speaker 4>weed is,</v>

4709
02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:52.020
<v Speaker 4>it ruins old episodes of cops.</v>

4710
02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:54.580
<v Speaker 4>Like that's something like when you see like [inaudible],</v>

4711
02:15:54.581 --> 02:15:55.890
<v Speaker 4>you see some people with like crack,</v>

4712
02:15:55.891 --> 02:16:00.110
<v Speaker 4>but then like you just see a guy that has like the smallest amount of just</v>

4713
02:16:00.130 --> 02:16:02.010
<v Speaker 4>probably like terrible weed and he's like,</v>

4714
02:16:02.011 --> 02:16:04.350
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna go to jail for a long time.</v>

4715
02:16:04.351 --> 02:16:04.450
<v Speaker 4>The</v>

4716
02:16:04.450 --> 02:16:05.680
<v Speaker 3>Zip tie his risk,</v>

4717
02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:07.090
<v Speaker 3>throwing them into a cage.</v>

4718
02:16:07.091 --> 02:16:07.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4719
02:16:07.241 --> 02:16:08.140
<v Speaker 3>It's fucked man.</v>

4720
02:16:08.530 --> 02:16:08.921
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4721
02:16:08.921 --> 02:16:09.754
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

4722
02:16:10.180 --> 02:16:10.991
<v Speaker 3>It is strange.</v>

4723
02:16:10.991 --> 02:16:14.260
<v Speaker 3>But Obama's passing these things until Jeb Bush gets in office,</v>

4724
02:16:14.261 --> 02:16:15.350
<v Speaker 3>then it all gets fucked that up.</v>

4725
02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:16.240
<v Speaker 3>You think that's what's going to be?</v>

4726
02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:16.961
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried,</v>

4727
02:16:16.961 --> 02:16:17.261
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4728
02:16:17.261 --> 02:16:17.651
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

4729
02:16:17.651 --> 02:16:17.891
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4730
02:16:17.891 --> 02:16:19.540
<v Speaker 3>if Jeb Bush doesn't get no office,</v>

4731
02:16:19.541 --> 02:16:20.770
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton will be president.</v>

4732
02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:21.550
<v Speaker 3>It'd be,</v>

4733
02:16:21.550 --> 02:16:22.420
<v Speaker 3>it'd be one of those two.</v>

4734
02:16:22.421 --> 02:16:23.620
<v Speaker 3>It'll be Jeb Bush or Hillary.</v>

4735
02:16:23.621 --> 02:16:24.431
<v Speaker 3>I'll take hillary over.</v>

4736
02:16:24.431 --> 02:16:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Jeb Bush.</v>

4737
02:16:25.010 --> 02:16:25.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4738
02:16:25.450 --> 02:16:25.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4739
02:16:25.631 --> 02:16:28.900
<v Speaker 3>I think it's time for a woman president still give her chicken chance to fuck</v>

4740
02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:29.740
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

4741
02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:30.160
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4742
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:30.790
<v Speaker 3>So we really,</v>

4743
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:34.150
<v Speaker 3>I think once hillary gets in and she does the exact same shit Obama did,</v>

4744
02:16:34.151 --> 02:16:34.841
<v Speaker 3>everybody's going to go,</v>

4745
02:16:34.841 --> 02:16:35.381
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4746
02:16:35.381 --> 02:16:37.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the president really gets to say anything.</v>

4747
02:16:38.350 --> 02:16:41.540
<v Speaker 4>It's going to go through every possible thing and then it's gonna just go back.</v>

4748
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.901
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4749
02:16:41.901 --> 02:16:45.650
<v Speaker 3>remember what it was all bad bitches be used again as a word,</v>

4750
02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:49.710
<v Speaker 3>but Obama was before he got into office,</v>

4751
02:16:49.711 --> 02:16:52.070
<v Speaker 3>like the most progressive guy ever.</v>

4752
02:16:52.250 --> 02:16:53.420
<v Speaker 3>The most anti,</v>

4753
02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:57.740
<v Speaker 3>like his stance on whistle blowers supporting whistleblowers.</v>

4754
02:16:57.920 --> 02:16:59.960
<v Speaker 3>He backtracked on all that shit.</v>

4755
02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:00.861
<v Speaker 3>Just going to close down.</v>

4756
02:17:00.861 --> 02:17:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Guantanamo Bay never happened.</v>

4757
02:17:03.130 --> 02:17:07.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean it took forever to get out of Iraq and then still by saying we're out of</v>

4758
02:17:07.521 --> 02:17:08.120
<v Speaker 3>Iraq,</v>

4759
02:17:08.120 --> 02:17:11.750
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of bullshit because there's thousands of fucking troops still in Iraq.</v>

4760
02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:12.531
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4761
02:17:12.531 --> 02:17:14.270
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan is still going on.</v>

4762
02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:19.480
<v Speaker 3>Most of what they say never comes true once they get into office and I think</v>

4763
02:17:19.551 --> 02:17:23.030
<v Speaker 3>it's because they can't really do the things they want to do.</v>

4764
02:17:23.150 --> 02:17:24.530
<v Speaker 3>There's too much going on.</v>

4765
02:17:24.531 --> 02:17:25.364
<v Speaker 3>There's too many.</v>

4766
02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:27.110
<v Speaker 3>There's too many influences.</v>

4767
02:17:27.111 --> 02:17:28.160
<v Speaker 3>There's too much money.</v>

4768
02:17:28.161 --> 02:17:29.330
<v Speaker 3>There's too much power.</v>

4769
02:17:29.510 --> 02:17:32.000
<v Speaker 3>I think the president has way less power than we think.</v>

4770
02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:33.201
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4771
02:17:33.201 --> 02:17:37.040
<v Speaker 4>it's always rough weather if there's a republican or a Democrat in the White</v>

4772
02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:37.070
<v Speaker 4>House.</v>

4773
02:17:37.070 --> 02:17:37.480
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4774
02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:37.631
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4775
02:17:37.631 --> 02:17:37.990
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

4776
02:17:37.990 --> 02:17:38.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4777
02:17:38.510 --> 02:17:40.700
<v Speaker 4>Whether there's a student myself,</v>

4778
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:42.550
<v Speaker 4>a Republican or Democrat in the White House,</v>

4779
02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:44.660
<v Speaker 4>like people forget about Congress.</v>

4780
02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:45.621
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

4781
02:17:45.621 --> 02:17:49.100
<v Speaker 4>That it can be a huge obstacle or the reason that a president can do so much.</v>

4782
02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:50.213
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>

4783
02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:50.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4784
02:17:50.491 --> 02:17:51.210
<v Speaker 3>It's huge.</v>

4785
02:17:51.210 --> 02:17:56.210
<v Speaker 3>And it's also the Republican versus Democrat fucking mudslinging that like</v>

4786
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:58.230
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to give an inch.</v>

4787
02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:02.520
<v Speaker 3>They're all just so this partisan ideology.</v>

4788
02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:06.270
<v Speaker 3>Whereas they just stick with the right wing and stick with the left wing and</v>

4789
02:18:06.271 --> 02:18:08.360
<v Speaker 3>they're all duking it out for control.</v>

4790
02:18:08.361 --> 02:18:13.170
<v Speaker 3>It's just so frustrating and it's like such a roadblock to any real progress.</v>

4791
02:18:13.550 --> 02:18:13.821
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4792
02:18:13.821 --> 02:18:14.140
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4793
02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:14.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

4794
02:18:14.770 --> 02:18:15.650
<v Speaker 4>it's A.</v>

4795
02:18:15.651 --> 02:18:16.381
<v Speaker 4>I covered the,</v>

4796
02:18:16.381 --> 02:18:20.960
<v Speaker 4>the rnc just because I got the opportunity and in and that was a weird thing</v>

4797
02:18:20.961 --> 02:18:22.250
<v Speaker 4>like the rnc and the DNC,</v>

4798
02:18:22.251 --> 02:18:26.240
<v Speaker 4>going to those events and just seeing how excited everyone is,</v>

4799
02:18:26.241 --> 02:18:31.010
<v Speaker 4>but how sensitive and like you say one thing and they'll jump down your throat</v>

4800
02:18:31.070 --> 02:18:32.000
<v Speaker 4>on either side.</v>

4801
02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:32.721
<v Speaker 4>They're on teams,</v>

4802
02:18:32.721 --> 02:18:34.640
<v Speaker 4>man versus the dolphins.</v>

4803
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:36.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's really what it is.</v>

4804
02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:37.550
<v Speaker 4>And then meanwhile you have people that are like,</v>

4805
02:18:37.551 --> 02:18:38.271
<v Speaker 4>I'm libertarian,</v>

4806
02:18:38.271 --> 02:18:38.601
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>

4807
02:18:38.601 --> 02:18:39.021
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>

4808
02:18:39.021 --> 02:18:39.351
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

4809
02:18:39.351 --> 02:18:40.184
<v Speaker 4>Whatever.</v>

4810
02:18:41.090 --> 02:18:45.960
<v Speaker 4>And that was something that I looked at for awhile and when I would talk to just</v>

4811
02:18:46.220 --> 02:18:47.240
<v Speaker 4>anyone that was in office,</v>

4812
02:18:47.241 --> 02:18:47.571
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>

4813
02:18:47.571 --> 02:18:51.110
<v Speaker 4>you could go libertarian or you could just be a modified version of one of the</v>

4814
02:18:51.111 --> 02:18:51.860
<v Speaker 4>two parties.</v>

4815
02:18:51.860 --> 02:18:53.030
<v Speaker 4>And that's a weird thing.</v>

4816
02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:54.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4817
02:18:54.100 --> 02:18:54.933
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4818
02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:55.611
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

4819
02:18:55.611 --> 02:18:55.911
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4820
02:18:55.911 --> 02:19:00.140
<v Speaker 3>I think until we realized that were being had across the board and that this is</v>

4821
02:19:00.141 --> 02:19:04.010
<v Speaker 3>all just a big charade that's being put on by corporations,</v>

4822
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:05.600
<v Speaker 3>we're never going to figure it out.</v>

4823
02:19:05.630 --> 02:19:08.630
<v Speaker 3>We're never going to get past private prisons.</v>

4824
02:19:08.631 --> 02:19:13.631
<v Speaker 3>And I mean the supreme court giving corporations the ability to donate on</v>

4825
02:19:14.301 --> 02:19:17.930
<v Speaker 3>limited amounts of money towards candidates and those candidates obviously</v>

4826
02:19:17.931 --> 02:19:22.040
<v Speaker 3>support these corporations ideas once they get into office and allow them to</v>

4827
02:19:22.041 --> 02:19:22.671
<v Speaker 3>make money.</v>

4828
02:19:22.671 --> 02:19:24.170
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of times that money,</v>

4829
02:19:24.171 --> 02:19:29.171
<v Speaker 3>making that money is detrimental to the greater good mankind or the population</v>

4830
02:19:29.481 --> 02:19:32.310
<v Speaker 3>or just people in general were.</v>

4831
02:19:32.340 --> 02:19:33.470
<v Speaker 3>We're in a weird place.</v>

4832
02:19:33.471 --> 02:19:37.460
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the things that we're seeing now though is transparency on a</v>

4833
02:19:37.461 --> 02:19:38.960
<v Speaker 3>level that we've never had before.</v>

4834
02:19:39.350 --> 02:19:40.580
<v Speaker 3>And ultimately,</v>

4835
02:19:40.581 --> 02:19:44.360
<v Speaker 3>I think that transparency and this distribution of information that we've been</v>

4836
02:19:44.361 --> 02:19:45.290
<v Speaker 3>talking about this,</v>

4837
02:19:45.291 --> 02:19:47.120
<v Speaker 3>this ability to access information,</v>

4838
02:19:47.420 --> 02:19:51.050
<v Speaker 3>it's going to make a really hard to hide all the evil shit you're doing.</v>

4839
02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:51.913
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4840
02:19:52.060 --> 02:19:52.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4841
02:19:52.540 --> 02:19:55.060
<v Speaker 4>there's been stuff coming out and that's seeing that,</v>

4842
02:19:55.061 --> 02:20:00.061
<v Speaker 4>like whether someone says Patriot or whistle blower or like not terrorist,</v>

4843
02:20:00.671 --> 02:20:01.700
<v Speaker 4>but a little bit of a.</v>

4844
02:20:02.050 --> 02:20:02.750
<v Speaker 4>what's the word I'm thinking?</v>

4845
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:03.583
<v Speaker 4>Insurgent.</v>

4846
02:20:03.610 --> 02:20:03.821
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4847
02:20:03.821 --> 02:20:06.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm just someone that turns on their own country having trader.</v>

4848
02:20:06.970 --> 02:20:07.390
<v Speaker 4>Huge.</v>

4849
02:20:07.390 --> 02:20:07.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4850
02:20:07.750 --> 02:20:08.583
<v Speaker 4>I'm having a brain fart.</v>

4851
02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:10.300
<v Speaker 4>But just like the people that go,</v>

4852
02:20:10.480 --> 02:20:10.721
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4853
02:20:10.721 --> 02:20:11.531
<v Speaker 4>what we did was wrong,</v>

4854
02:20:11.531 --> 02:20:13.390
<v Speaker 4>but they had no right to put that,</v>

4855
02:20:13.391 --> 02:20:15.980
<v Speaker 4>put out that information and just seeing those arguments and like,</v>

4856
02:20:16.140 --> 02:20:16.770
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4857
02:20:16.770 --> 02:20:17.071
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

4858
02:20:17.071 --> 02:20:19.890
<v Speaker 3>like the Chelsea manning argument or the uh,</v>

4859
02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:23.280
<v Speaker 3>the wikileaks Julian assange's argument.</v>

4860
02:20:23.281 --> 02:20:23.401
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4861
02:20:23.401 --> 02:20:25.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean those people are in jail.</v>

4862
02:20:25.260 --> 02:20:27.990
<v Speaker 3>Those people did things that everybody thinks we're right.</v>

4863
02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean if everyone who's rational,</v>

4864
02:20:30.180 --> 02:20:32.580
<v Speaker 3>you look at what Chelsea manning the,</v>

4865
02:20:32.610 --> 02:20:35.280
<v Speaker 3>the life that she's had since she's been in jail,</v>

4866
02:20:35.690 --> 02:20:36.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4867
02:20:36.210 --> 02:20:37.950
<v Speaker 3>locked up naked,</v>

4868
02:20:38.280 --> 02:20:43.280
<v Speaker 3>left in a cell cold with no clothes,</v>

4869
02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:45.750
<v Speaker 3>solitary confinement for years.</v>

4870
02:20:45.751 --> 02:20:46.351
<v Speaker 3>Literally.</v>

4871
02:20:46.351 --> 02:20:46.531
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4872
02:20:46.531 --> 02:20:48.330
<v Speaker 3>that's psychological torture,</v>

4873
02:20:48.331 --> 02:20:48.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're,</v>

4874
02:20:48.810 --> 02:20:53.810
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to break people and this is someone that just exposed illegal</v>

4875
02:20:54.301 --> 02:20:59.010
<v Speaker 3>activity and released information to this Julian assange character who now is</v>

4876
02:20:59.011 --> 02:21:01.560
<v Speaker 3>trapped in a fucking house in London,</v>

4877
02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:02.491
<v Speaker 3>can't leave.</v>

4878
02:21:02.491 --> 02:21:04.200
<v Speaker 3>He's in an embassy or he goes to jail,</v>

4879
02:21:04.290 --> 02:21:04.891
<v Speaker 3>but meanwhile,</v>

4880
02:21:04.891 --> 02:21:05.730
<v Speaker 3>if you had a vote,</v>

4881
02:21:05.731 --> 02:21:08.730
<v Speaker 3>a worldwide vote as to whether or not they did good things,</v>

4882
02:21:08.731 --> 02:21:09.900
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Edward Snowden,</v>

4883
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.980
<v Speaker 3>same sort of situation.</v>

4884
02:21:10.981 --> 02:21:12.330
<v Speaker 3>If you have a worldwide vote,</v>

4885
02:21:12.540 --> 02:21:16.830
<v Speaker 3>what they did was that beneficial or was it negative for humanity and I will</v>

4886
02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:19.620
<v Speaker 3>guarantee you the vast majority would say it's beneficial,</v>

4887
02:21:19.650 --> 02:21:19.921
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4888
02:21:19.921 --> 02:21:20.101
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4889
02:21:20.101 --> 02:21:24.120
<v Speaker 4>the argument is that like you could potentially put us assets at risk if you</v>

4890
02:21:24.121 --> 02:21:25.770
<v Speaker 4>just throw out all this information,</v>

4891
02:21:25.771 --> 02:21:27.390
<v Speaker 4>but it is very much,</v>

4892
02:21:27.630 --> 02:21:28.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4893
02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:30.040
<v Speaker 4>we did something wrong and you're,</v>

4894
02:21:30.041 --> 02:21:33.600
<v Speaker 4>you're putting us at risk because you're bringing it to light rather than going,</v>

4895
02:21:33.630 --> 02:21:33.841
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4896
02:21:33.841 --> 02:21:37.680
<v Speaker 4>well let's bring this to light and let's not fucking do it again.</v>

4897
02:21:37.770 --> 02:21:38.550
<v Speaker 4>That'd be great.</v>

4898
02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:38.701
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4899
02:21:38.701 --> 02:21:43.701
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly in some ways a gray area because intelligence operates under this</v>

4900
02:21:45.390 --> 02:21:50.010
<v Speaker 3>sort of a really strange blanket and the idea behind it is they're trying to</v>

4901
02:21:50.011 --> 02:21:53.370
<v Speaker 3>protect society from the evil people of the world and sometimes you got to break</v>

4902
02:21:53.371 --> 02:21:54.870
<v Speaker 3>a few eggs to make an Omelet,</v>

4903
02:21:55.260 --> 02:21:56.580
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

4904
02:21:56.670 --> 02:21:57.503
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4905
02:21:57.510 --> 02:22:01.590
<v Speaker 3>Obama's whole stance going into office is completely contrary to what's going on</v>

4906
02:22:01.591 --> 02:22:02.424
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

4907
02:22:02.570 --> 02:22:05.490
<v Speaker 3>That whole whole hope and change website that he had,</v>

4908
02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:08.280
<v Speaker 3>they removed the whole piece on whistleblowers.</v>

4909
02:22:08.310 --> 02:22:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

4910
02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:09.511
<v Speaker 3>Because it was a bit.</v>

4911
02:22:09.511 --> 02:22:09.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4912
02:22:09.631 --> 02:22:10.464
<v Speaker 3>it was a big story.</v>

4913
02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:11.221
<v Speaker 3>Big Story.</v>

4914
02:22:11.221 --> 02:22:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4915
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:12.451
<v Speaker 3>Because people like,</v>

4916
02:22:12.451 --> 02:22:12.930
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

4917
02:22:12.930 --> 02:22:13.770
<v Speaker 3>remember this?</v>

4918
02:22:13.890 --> 02:22:14.960
<v Speaker 3>And then they like try,</v>

4919
02:22:15.170 --> 02:22:19.680
<v Speaker 3>just cut that out and deleted it and we delete it from the Internet.</v>

4920
02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:21.250
<v Speaker 3>Never pop up ever again.</v>

4921
02:22:21.370 --> 02:22:25.960
<v Speaker 3>We can slowly but surely remove it like Alyssa and tweets and</v>

4922
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:26.813
<v Speaker 1>she's been deleting.</v>

4923
02:22:28.510 --> 02:22:29.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

4924
02:22:29.310 --> 02:22:29.731
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>

4925
02:22:29.731 --> 02:22:30.564
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mad at you.</v>

4926
02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

4927
02:22:31.230 --> 02:22:32.820
<v Speaker 1>I'd be mad at me too if I didn't know me.</v>

4928
02:22:33.220 --> 02:22:34.053
<v Speaker 1>So good kid.</v>

4929
02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:36.000

4930
02:22:36.420 --> 02:22:37.253
<v Speaker 1>it's all right.</v>

4931
02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

4932
02:22:37.770 --> 02:22:38.460
<v Speaker 1>we got to get out of here.</v>
