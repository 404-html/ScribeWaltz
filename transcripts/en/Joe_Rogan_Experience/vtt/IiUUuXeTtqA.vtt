WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.530
Oh wait a minute,
we didn't even like this.

2
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.240
<v 1>Hmm.
Like</v>

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.330
this is the sound of freedom.

4
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.880
That's freedom.
As it exhales your body as Mother Nature,

5
00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:29.210
his mother Gaia enters into your system.

6
00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:31.010
There were a series of cannabinoid receptors.

7
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.140
<v 0>Hmm.
I'm good dude.</v>

8
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.850
<v 1>Starting a new non political party.
Sammy.</v>

9
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.940
I don't think anybody should be in a political party anymore.
I agree.
But uh,

10
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.853
<v 0>and uh,</v>

11
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.110
<v 1>out of respect for the great hunter s Thompson,</v>

12
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.350
I'm going to call it the freak party.
Man.
Dick.
I feel like a freak.

13
00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:58.090
I don't feel like I,
I'm represented.
I,
uh,

14
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.000
will never vote for any of the two major parties ever get even libertarians.

15
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:07.560
They fucking freaked me out.
A bunch of Weirdos.
Much a preppers.
Oh,
all of you.

16
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.320
Not all.
If you don't get crazy,
you don't get picky.
Say the hate mail.

17
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:13.560
Say the hate mail.
I will only vote for someone if I don't know who they are.

18
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.990
That doesn't help.
Yeah.
Because well,
yeah,

19
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:20.910
it does know who they are and there's some fucking freak NSA under ground secret

20
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.420
infiltrator agent type character Sam.
Okay.

21
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.570
That could go if my vote ruin society,
I understand that,

22
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:31.830
but I just vote for anybody who can't afford to campaign.

23
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.460
That's pretty much,
well,
that might be better than what we're doing already,

24
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.720
but it might not be too.
That's possible as well.
You know,
we need to do Sam,

25
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.240
we need to educate the people.
Is that possible?

26
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.300
This is a way to do it and one of the ways is audible.com oh really?

27
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.950
I'd love to hear about it.
Well,

28
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:51.951
automotive.com is the number one source of audio entertainment and education on

29
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:56.490
the Internet more than a hundred thousand different titles.

30
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.070
You can't possibly read 100,000 fucking things,

31
00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:04.071
but you might be able to put a good dent into it if you got in your car or if

32
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:09.240
you were on a train or on a plane and listen to audio books more at the gym or

33
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:10.074
jogging.

34
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.310
If you're one of those nature at the park type characters that's not worried

35
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:16.920
about muggers and you're running around with a fucking thing on,

36
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:19.260
not worried about getting clipped over the head by someone who's sneaking up

37
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:19.621
behind you.

38
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:22.090
You don't see them coming or maybe you just fucking that confident and your,

39
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.490
your foot speed.
You dislike this motherfucking mugger try to catch me bitch.

40
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.450
Yeah.
Try to catch me.
My cardio is off the charts.

uh,

47
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.750
pile of awesome titles,
uh,

48
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.830
in every single category.
Um,

49
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.080
I recommend Steven Pressfield's the war of art.

50
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.470
This is a book that I've been recommended to everybody.
I,

51
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.590
it's such a good book as far as like motivation to get your shit together that
I,

52
00:03:07.591 --> 00:03:11.330
I bought stacks of them and I used to hand them out to people all the time.
Um,

53
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.110
and then I got tired of it and I was like,
pick gay shit together,
bitch.

54
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.710
What am I doing?
I'm trying to fucking motivate other people.
I listen to audible.

55
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.940
I actually use it.
Yeah,
it's very good.
I love it.
I,
uh,

56
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.300
the a book that I love to listen to,
I was a behold a pale horse.

57
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.620
That was a good thing.
I had read it,

58
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:29.920
but it was fun to hear back down is some re ridiculous shit.

59
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.130
It's fun to listen to man.
It's actually,

60
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.900
when you look back at like what he's saying then and what's going on now,

61
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.010
you're like,
Whoa,
well his book is like,
I can't recommend it.
I'm of it.

62
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.290
You can't recommend it enough.
I love it,
dude.

63
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:45.220
You got to smoke a fat joint before you read that and then just shut it off,

64
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.910
walk away.
Um,

65
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.700
there's some really interesting stuff in there and some complete nonsense.

66
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.940
It's really like if you wanted to pick a book where you were worried or curious

67
00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:00.550
whether or not like there was some disinflation of foot,

68
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:03.320
whether they were trying to connect really,
you know,

69
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.430
actual factual ideas with fucking bs UFO basis at Walmart.

70
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.550
You know,
this is the book.
So you're saying there's a little truth,

71
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:15.730
but there's also a lot of misinformation.
I'm sure there's some truth in that.

72
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.210
Well,
even crazy people can count.
You know,

73
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.420
even if you're completely out of your mind,
you make a bunch of shit up.

74
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.140
You might know how to turn on a laptop.
A broken clock is right twice a day.

75
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.150
That's so true.
Sam Tripoli.
I'm so glad when people say that shit.
Anyway,

76
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:36.151
go to audible.com forward slash Joe Steve Martin's books good too.

77
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.410
Yes,
it is.
Right.
What is it born standings and what it is.

78
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.990
Steve Martin's awesome and he actually reads his book.
Uh,
and uh,

79
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.830
or you could that guy from a fucking,
what's it called?
The beard guy.

80
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.930
Sy.
The one that Joey Diaz from the duck dynasty.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

81
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:56.510
I was that guy.
He really loves that guy.
He's not a note.
No bullshit.

82
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.520
He loves that guy crushing it.
Fuck yet is it?
She'll kick my,

83
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.750
his ass really stomped it here.
You're up against a family though.

84
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.720
And Dennis Miller vernacular,
like a narc at a biker rally.
Um,

85
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.750
anyway,
audible.com four slash Joe and a get a free audio book.
It's worth it.

86
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:17.920
You'll love it.
And it's,
it's a great way to entertain yourself.
Um,

87
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.420
basically just like podcasting,

88
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:22.420
I'm essentially cutting out my own hamstrings telling you about this.
It is,

89
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:26.650
it is.
We're also brought to you by Lumosity.

90
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:31.651
Lumosity is one of our newest sponsors and Lumosity is a new service.

91
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.580
It's a website that's designed to improve your mental health.

92
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.990
It's really interesting.

93
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:42.070
It's like workouts for your mind and they're like fun games and I've been doing

94
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:46.090
it.
I don't know if I'm any smarter yet,
but um,
it's easy.
It's enjoyable.
Um,

95
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.830
and you can personalize it for you.

96
00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:51.250
Different performance goals as far as your brain,

97
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:52.570
does it have a little sound effect on it?

98
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.740
Well that's a chalk one against Lumosity.
Okay.
Let me tell you something.

99
00:05:56.741 --> 00:06:01.130
Nobody wants fucking sound effects on their website.
We're tired of that.

100
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.740
This is the worst thing when you go to someone's website,
no song plays.

101
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:07.040
All right.
That's why I hate about my space.
Like back in the day,

102
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:09.830
you couldn't look at other girls like website pages.

103
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:11.720
Cause of song would jump up your girlfriends.

104
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.510
Like what are you listening to you like close,
close,
close.
And it would make you,

105
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.520
it would crush your website,
your browser tabs.

106
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.590
Someone always had some wacky thing running in the background too much.

107
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:23.120
And you get to,
it's like,
what is this?

108
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:26.030
Especially the Asian chicks could really go off on their pages,

109
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.930
sparkled tanks.
That's where we learned about the world.

110
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:33.140
We're in about sparkled tags.
Ah,
you can play online at work.

111
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.780
I wouldn't recommend playing at work cause then you're not working.
And,
uh,

112
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.520
I think if you're gonna do something,
she just fucking do it.

113
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.610
Unless your job really sucks the fat deck and you're looking to get out and you

114
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:43.280
listen to this podcast during work right now.

115
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.700
And I would say keep doing what you're doing.
Follow your instincts,

116
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.610
go towards the light.
Do you have a black belt in this yet?
Yes,

117
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:52.940
I've got a black problem on my God,
my friend play online at work,
at home,

118
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.930
even from an iPhone or an iPad with the Lumosity APP,
it takes,

119
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.560
it doesn't say anything about android.
I guess they're haters.
Uh,

120
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:04.340
with Lumosity you can track your progress online while seeing the actual

121
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:08.660
improvements in your everyday life.
Um,
and when you go to Lumosity,

122
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:12.680
just tell them that I sent you just,
I think it's a reference box.
Who,
well,

123
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.480
how'd you find a little bit Lumos Joe Rogan Bitch.
And you can say that to fish.

124
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.720
I probably won't even get credit for it,
but it'd be funnier.
So go ahead.

125
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.910
Say Joe Rogan Bitch.
I'm like,
well,
Joe Rogan,

126
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:26.120
it seems that no one from your show went to Lumosity,

127
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:30.890
but everybody from Joe Rogan bitch went there.
Um,

128
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.330
Joe Rogan calm a bitch.
Would that get passed?
It's dot,
dot,
dot.
Bitch.

129
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.160
Um,
what I like about it I think is interesting is you can,

130
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.520
you can personalize your goals,
uh,
which is,

131
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.280
it's kind of kind of odd when you first started doing it because you're like,

132
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:48.890
wait a minute.
You can,
you can,
why not?

133
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:50.750
Why wouldn't it be better to click everything?

134
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.200
I guess maybe it'd be too difficult,
but as you're doing it,
like it gives you,

135
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:57.890
like memory gives you a bunch of options.
Recalling the location of objects,

136
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.980
remembering the names after first introduction,

137
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.000
which I suck a fat one at.
Do you,

138
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.470
are you good at remembering people's names or an FTE meet him?
No,

139
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:07.760
I'm horrible at it.

140
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.030
People always think my memory's really good because I remember fights.

141
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.810
Like if you ask me about MMA,
I can pull MMA.
I'll pull a heath,

142
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.040
Keith Hackney fight.

143
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.600
Keith Hackney versus Joe Sohn know from 93 94 I can,

144
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.780
I'll tell you what happened in that fight.
I'll talk to you about ball punches,

145
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.320
detail.
I remember some things.
Yeah,
I remember some things,

146
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.020
but my memory's not the best if I don't care,

147
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.800
you rock those Russian and European names at the weigh ins.

148
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.580
I'm always impressed by that.
They have to go over those with me several times.

149
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.830
I fucked up homie.
Lawn check though.
Oh,

150
00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:44.450
me lawn check was a guy that fought this last weekend in Toronto.
It was so hard.

151
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:48.020
Only launch [inaudible] it's,
it's weird the way it's written.
Tough guy though.

152
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.210
Um,
you can keep track of several ideas at the same time.
Allegedly.

153
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.890
I'm a little skeptical.
Sam,
the [inaudible].
Right?

154
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.430
How are you going to fix my broken brain son?
Fears broken?

155
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:03.090
My must be the Ahhbra hands are broken.
The heap,
they're flawed.
You know,

156
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:07.230
it helps it now for brain.
Take some right now while I'm on the podcast.
Oh,

157
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:10.440
Elsa brains for it.
Yeah.
Alpha brains.

158
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.520
I wonder if it improves the score was the word on nasty.

159
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.433
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

160
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.700
<v 1>Uh,
the words on one an Alpha brain.
It's delicious.
It's nutritious.</v>

161
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.740
Good for the whole family dome.
Uh,
attention,
maintain focus on important tasks.

162
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.103
<v 0>MMM.</v>

163
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.270
<v 1>For those who've been asking about Alpha brand,
we'll talk about that next.</v>

164
00:09:31.271 --> 00:09:35.750
But the studies on Alpha brain will finally be published,
uh,

165
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.060
allegedly in February.

166
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.250
It takes a long time to get into a scientific journal about stuff.

167
00:09:39.251 --> 00:09:42.010
So people have been asking about the results of the double blind,

168
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.050
the seat placebo tests.
Um,

169
00:09:44.051 --> 00:09:46.750
we did what's called a pilot test and then we're going to do a big fat test

170
00:09:46.751 --> 00:09:51.220
after this.
Uh,
but it's because of the pilot test is very encouraging.
Um,

171
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.060
I guess that would help you if you took a little more,
do a Mazda.

172
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.940
I think the idea behind something like Lumosity is that your brain,

173
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:02.810
much like everything else grows in strength with repetition and folks.

174
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.060
Uh,
it seems to work as far as like my brain when it comes to standup comedy,

175
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.730
the more I'm doing stand up,
the more I'm like,

176
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:14.230
the more I'm in that standup comedy vibe.
It seems like a mental shape.

177
00:10:14.231 --> 00:10:16.690
Like you get in comedy shape,
right?
You feel like that?
Yeah.

178
00:10:16.691 --> 00:10:19.020
He ever take like two weeks off from standup.

179
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.970
I took a few months off and you go back to it,
you're like,
whoa.

180
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.940
It's like you think you're just going to step right into it and start running

181
00:10:24.941 --> 00:10:29.440
and you're like,
if your timing's a little off,
it's,
what was that line there?

182
00:10:29.441 --> 00:10:33.760
It's not,
I figured out though how to stop that from happening.
Record yourself.

183
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.610
Really?
Yeah,
it's big.
It's huge.
What do you do with that?

184
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.070
You just play back or do you upload it to something?
Well,

185
00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:42.350
play it back and take notes.
Listen and take note to that dude.

186
00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:44.320
It's hard to do because it's work.
It's work.

187
00:10:44.321 --> 00:10:47.890
You don't wanna listen to yourself gross.
Like,
I do hate lik in myself.

188
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.550
I've got to edit this CD and I just can't listen to myself.

189
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:55.810
Jim Norton told me that when he was,
when he was a editing,
his is a special,

190
00:10:55.811 --> 00:10:58.420
which was very funny by the way.
You want wanted to hang himself.

191
00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.930
He put a fucking belt up,
uh,
on the coat hanger in the closet.
He goes,

192
00:11:01.931 --> 00:11:03.700
I wasn't going to do it,
but I just put it up there.

193
00:11:03.701 --> 00:11:06.140
I just wanted to let myself know I fucking suck.
Yeah,

194
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.250
you were thinking about hang on yourself once he goes,
I wasn't,
I wasn't,

195
00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:12.010
wasn't that wasn't actually going to go through with it,
but it was like,
whoa.

196
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.120
You keep it on the table.

197
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.750
That's how bad comedians hate listen to themselves and if you talk to a

198
00:11:16.751 --> 00:11:20.430
committee with loves,
listened himself,
he's hurt too.

199
00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.700
There are people like to play back their stuff over and over again.
You're like,

200
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.140
oh,
what's wrong about the it for you?
Hey,
listen to this.
Listen to this bit.

201
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:32.860
I did listen this bit.
I did.
I'll just listen to this one bit.
No,
no.

202
00:11:32.861 --> 00:11:35.940
Down,
down,
down now.
Now know,
um,

203
00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.920
another thing that Lumosity helps is flexibility.

204
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.870
The idea of mental flexibility,
communicating clearly.
You know,

205
00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:47.770
sometimes when you're communicating it's difficult to find the right way to

206
00:11:47.771 --> 00:11:51.550
describe something.
The idea is that the more often you do that,

207
00:11:51.551 --> 00:11:54.040
the easier it will be.
And I think that it's absolutely

208
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.530
<v 2>true because when I think about the things that I do,</v>

209
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.480
like a lot of the things that I do like,

210
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.410
like MMA commentary would be very difficult to do if you hadn't done it before.

211
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:06.100
And the more you do it,
the more you get sort of sharp at it.
Um,

212
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.500
well Lumosity treats it like that.

213
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:13.550
There's exercises you can do that will allow you to be flexible in your ideas

214
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:19.240
and that sort of a way.
Thinking outside the box,
avoiding errors,
multitasking.

215
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.490
How's your multitasking skills,
Sim,
sharepoint Kim,

216
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.810
and incredibly hard and incredibly bad about as bad as can be.
Right?
Right.

217
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.850
Comedians are the worst fucking multitaskers in the history of the world.

218
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.790
Pulse of Shitheads,
multitasking butts,
a bad,

219
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.600
it's add version of multitasking where like,
I tried to do 90 things,

220
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.680
but yet nothing gets done.
You're like,

221
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.980
ah man,
I want to do this over here.
And then at the end of the day I'm like,

222
00:12:41.981 --> 00:12:43.510
I've got nothing accomplished.

223
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:46.890
Every time I talked to Brian Kelly wants to fucking start yachting and wants a,

224
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.660
I want to go sail boating.
I think I'm thinking about doing a sambo,

225
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.400
maybe Samba and Samba old under dance and choke people like,
dude,
stop,
stop,
stop,

226
00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:58.270
stop,
stop.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He wants to do everything got done.

227
00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:00.490
Telling me like I was talking about being gluten free.

228
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.680
I've been gluten free for like three months ago.
See,
I don't,

229
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.780
I don't need any of that stuff.
You know,
brands and brand.
I go,

230
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:09.781
you just had a sandwich right in front of me and you had bread with dinner last

231
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.490
night.
I saw you buttered bread.
He goes,
this I believe very little live it.

232
00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:15.490
I barely eat any of it.
I go,
you had bread every time.
You hadn't been here.

233
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.040
You've been here for three days.
You've had bread every single day.

234
00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:21.880
Like what are you talking about?
You guys are both pretty shredded for your eyes,

235
00:13:21.881 --> 00:13:26.260
man.
I'm pretty impressed.
He just saw my socks.
Me.
Yeah.
Thank you very much.

236
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.830
Side got uncomfortable that he's gluten free.
I'm like,
you're not gluten free.

237
00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:32.500
You're fucking line.
Do you eat bread every Goddamn Day?
He,

238
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.860
it's a story fits his reality.
He wants,
he's hilarious.

239
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.180
But it's that most entertaining.

240
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:39.220
One of the most entertaining dudes I've ever met.

241
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.400
We did a USO together and we'd flew cross country and everybody was jet lagged

242
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.820
and we have,
when you do a Uso,
you've got to meet everybody at the base.

243
00:13:48.821 --> 00:13:49.990
It's a big day for them.

244
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.690
The comedians are going to come around and you meet everybody.

245
00:13:52.691 --> 00:13:55.060
You go on this like mini tour of the base.

246
00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:58.700
You meet everybody and they tell you what they do.
Man,

247
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.090
everybody was jet lag.
But ma'am,

248
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.220
Brian put on a show dude,
he was just on for,

249
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:09.160
I mean just what you see on stage he was doing in their offices.

250
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.090
So when he came up onto the stage and I introduced them,
first guy up,

251
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.860
walked up to a standing out,

252
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:20.290
he'd already made you loved everybody mentally that they'd love them right out

253
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:22.480
the gate.
You already told the story on this podcast before,

254
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.480
but it's a great story.
Well thank you.
It's a great story.
It's in a while.

255
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.340
That is Brian Cowen.
That is,

256
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.800
I remember it because I remember you saying about everybody.

257
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:33.160
Not that I haven't told a million fucking stories.
Sometimes I forget what.

258
00:14:33.161 --> 00:14:35.590
So I've told Dude,
we're almost 400 podcasts.

259
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.160
The each one of them is like at least two hours.
Most of them three hours long.

260
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:42.100
So how the fuck could you pause when you got,
when it comes to stand up,

261
00:14:42.101 --> 00:14:47.101
do you ever find yourself somewhat repeating a premise even though it's kind of

262
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:50.680
a different take,
but the same kind of premise?
I mean like,

263
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:51.920
cause like I'm learning that

264
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.730
<v 1>your perspective on stuff is almost the same and there's only so much.</v>

265
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.440
Maybe the talk about,
I don't know.

266
00:14:57.441 --> 00:15:00.680
I feel like even with myself I've seen where you're like,
okay,

267
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:04.670
that's a lot like an old joke I used to tell.
Yeah,
it's very possible.
Anyway,

268
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.220
Lumosity got com.
Yeah,
check it out.
Tell him,
tell him Joe Rogan San.
Yeah.

269
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.080
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com that's o.N ,
N.
I t.

270
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.570
If you haven't seen a new primal bells in,
there's three of them.

271
00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:18.470
Now there's a gorilla,
a chimpanzee,
and a new orangutan.
And uh,

272
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:23.030
every time someone buys an orangutan,
five bucks goes to help save orangutans.

273
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.220
All these animals,
chimps,
gorillas,
they're all endangered.
It's,
uh,

274
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.700
you know,
were assholes and we liked to kill monkeys.
I mean,
that's just,

275
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.870
that's a fact.
Horrible.
It's a,
I say we as in human race,

276
00:15:35.871 --> 00:15:37.520
not Sam and I and not Jamie either.

277
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.250
And he's not a monkey killer by any stretch of the imagination.
Spanked Monkey.

278
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:40.910
That's about it.

279
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:45.320
Monkeys are [inaudible] a bunch of monkeys killed a guy in India.
I don't know,

280
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.870
maybe the Indian guy started it.
He might have been a dick,
but these are monkeys.

281
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.230
Anyway,
there apes,
people get real specific about that.

282
00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:55.690
You see monkey boots really mean.
Yes.
I mean,
a guide can send people,

283
00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.740
gorillas,
orangutans,
chimps.
I work out with them and myself.
They're cool.

284
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.950
I like to fantasize when I work out.
And,
uh,

285
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:08.090
my fantasy is that one of these things is trying to fuck me up.
I get scared.

286
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.310
You're holding onto a look at that chimpanzee face.

287
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.320
That's an evil or the gorilla to look at that motherfucker.
He might've,

288
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.370
that motherfucker was hovering over you about to put a beat down on you.

289
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.600
What do you do,
man?

290
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.660
You curl up in a ball and he probably gets tired of beating the shit out of you

291
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:21.980
and that's probably not going to help.

292
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.440
He's probably going to take you apart like a fucking pistachio nut,

293
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:29.060
like the shell of a nut snap and just separate you.
Oh,

294
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:29.961
you're so strong.

295
00:16:29.961 --> 00:16:33.230
We can't even wrap our heads around how strong this fucking thing.
So,
but uh,

296
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:36.620
you can be stronger with primal bills.

297
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:40.730
We sell regular kettle bells too if you're one of those conservative no nonsense

298
00:16:40.731 --> 00:16:45.500
type who does a traditional cal and see.
But if the kettle bells that we serve,

299
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:49.040
we sell as far as the primal bells,
the only go up to 72 pounds.

300
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.260
But as far as the regular plain ones,
we have them,
um,

301
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.980
up to 90 pounds.
And if you can lift one of those 90 pound things,

302
00:16:57.981 --> 00:17:01.640
you are a motherfucker.
That's impressive.
Shit.

303
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:06.980
I don't do social status.
You have reached motherfuckers status,

304
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:12.030
motherfucker status 90 pound kettle bell will also be sure to Piss your mailman

305
00:17:12.501 --> 00:17:15.080
off to no end and make no mistake about it.

306
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.320
When I picked up to 70 pound one to look,
they had in their face,

307
00:17:18.321 --> 00:17:21.800
they wanted to fucking drop it on my Dick.
That'd be uncomfortable.

308
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.010
A bunch of women working there as well and it's really not fair.

309
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.830
I wish they would let me know when they're coming in and I would be there to

310
00:17:27.831 --> 00:17:32.120
load it off the truck.
That involves teamwork.
Hmm.
Oh,

311
00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:36.470
you know there was lot of that too.
Let me know when it reaches the post office.

312
00:17:36.471 --> 00:17:40.310
I'll go get it.
Don't,
don't bring it to me.
Me Lift some 70 pound back.

313
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:47.120
Anyway,
for savagery,
go to [inaudible] dot com we saw all kinds of shit,

314
00:17:47.121 --> 00:17:51.870
protein supplements,
the brain of course,
shroom tech,
sport,
new mood.

315
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.320
If you ever tried any new mood Samwise no,
I have not.
It's very good for you.

316
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:58.710
It's five HTP and l tryptofan enhancement.

317
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.990
I need that for your serotonin.
Um,

318
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:07.350
El Tryptofan actually converts to five HTP and five HTP actually does enhance

319
00:18:07.351 --> 00:18:11.370
your mood.
You should be very careful about it though,
if you're on medication,

320
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:12.810
especially if you're on SSR.

321
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:15.960
I's of those are a lot of the antidepressants they tell people,

322
00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:20.961
do not take five HTP while you're taking an Ssri because too much serotonin is

323
00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:26.190
not a good thing.
That's a lot of paperwork.
Got It.
Be Falls on.

324
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.420
<v 2>Oh,
all right.
So go,
uh,</v>

325
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.100
<v 1>go to [inaudible] dot com check out everything.</v>

327
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:39.560
Beautiful,
talented and delicious young Sandwich Tripoli's here.

328

331
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.330
Don't worry about me choosing music.
Sam's hair

experience.
Joe Rogan podcast.

333
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.450
I've got an official Sam Tripoli,
the naughty show tee shirt on right now.

334
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:12.290
This gentleman,
you could buy these,
uh,
at Walmart,
Burger King,

335
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.170
food chains all over the place.
All over the country.

336
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.730
They're going to sell them a NASA.

337
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.050
They're going to sell him on the space shuttle.

338
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.810
Those bitches get bored of [inaudible] dot net.
Check it out by shirt.

339
00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.440
If you've never seen Sam show,
it's um,

340
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:29.530
he puts together stand up comedy with a bunch of crazy videos and I was there

341
00:19:29.841 --> 00:19:32.730
once and I saw a girl beat a man with a belt.
Yeah,
it was pretty,

342
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.110
that was classic non show.

343
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.480
If there's a lot of porn stars answering trivia questions,
it's a,
it's a,
it's a,

344
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:43.340
it's basically chaos.
It is.
It's a big crazy,
chaotic,

345
00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:48.290
silly,
fast.
It's a comedy circus man.
Much like Sam's mind.
Yes it is.

346
00:19:48.291 --> 00:19:50.410
It's all over the place.
That's your mind.

347
00:19:50.411 --> 00:19:52.520
And that's the kind of show you create all the outlaws.
You know,

348
00:19:52.521 --> 00:19:55.940
people focus on the adult film stars and they're really just a small part of a

349
00:19:55.941 --> 00:19:59.120
huge thing and it's just bringing out all this,
you know,

350
00:19:59.121 --> 00:20:02.870
you call them savages all the late night rumblers that people who like can't get

351
00:20:02.871 --> 00:20:03.681
on the tonight show,

352
00:20:03.681 --> 00:20:08.330
like all these crazy burlesque people and comics come and doing real con like

353
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.140
comedy they want to do and just crazy pole dancers who like,

354
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.190
I mean like it's madness saying it is madness.
I've done it several times and a,

355
00:20:16.191 --> 00:20:18.350
it's always a great crowd.
I mean,
even though it's madness,

356
00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.510
they're really fun people.
They,
they're there to have a good time.

357
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.240
When's your next one?
Ah,
we're,

358
00:20:22.241 --> 00:20:26.600
we're thinking about doing an October 25th at this place called lyrics on

359
00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.620
labrea.
I wouldn't say it's really not out.
Yeah,

360
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:35.000
I like to move into different places,
man.
You know,
the comedy store is great,

361
00:20:35.001 --> 00:20:37.730
but it's time to move it somewhere else and try a little different.
You know,

362
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.080
I was trying to do Beecher's madhouse,
but that guy,

363
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.520
it's a little crazy over there.
Great Guy.
It just didn't work out.

364
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:48.160
So I got this new room and it's lyrics and it's a nice room.
Sits about one 50

365
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.750
<v 3>and Warren,
we're going to crush.
Yep.
Very nice.
And so this is uh,
October 20 what?</v>

366
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:57.550
25th what day is that?
That's a a Friday night.
Sweet Baby Jesus.

367
00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:01.840
But to 24th,
October 24th I also do a new awesome show that you got to check out.

368
00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:03.490
It's called the comedy rap battles.

369
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.380
It's like eight mile meets standup comedy and it's awesome.
It is awesome.

370
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.300
It comedy rap battles.
Yeah,
Dude.

371
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:13.510
Comedians do like a five minute set and then they go like,
they rap,

372
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.040
they have a rap battle and dude,

373
00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:20.530
people light each other up is the most entertaining show you'll ever see.
Man.
I,

374
00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:23.880
it's the best.
I'm so proud of it.
And I worked with a bunch of,
uh,

375
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.580
Chris Byrne and a whole bunch of other guys and we put together and man,

376
00:21:27.581 --> 00:21:28.870
it just crushes.

377
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.070
Now have any comedians lashed out physically at any other comedians during a rap

378
00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:36.020
battle?
No.
No,
no.
I think everybody gets it.

379
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:40.690
It's like they feel bad if they don't light somebody up.
But people get lit up,

380
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.670
lit up.
It does happen in the wrap ones though.

381
00:21:43.671 --> 00:21:45.700
It's occasionally do punch each other.
Oh yeah.

382
00:21:45.701 --> 00:21:49.900
I mean some of those guys get pretty nasty and personal.
They go after the moms.

383
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.810
I think these comedians more light,
but they're vicious.
A,
it's a fun show,
man.
I,

384
00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.430
I'm really impressed by,
we're getting some big name djs coming down to this one,

385
00:21:57.431 --> 00:22:00.370
at the Improv on the 24th and it's going to be a great show,
man.

386
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.040
It's going to be a great,
sounds awesome.
That sounds fun.

387
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.250
Do you know who's on the,
on the card,
like the full card?
Ah,

388
00:22:06.251 --> 00:22:10.240
I put it together still for the rap battle.
Some of these people,

389
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:13.510
like they're really great comics are like,
you can't advertise me.
I'm like,
well,

390
00:22:13.511 --> 00:22:16.150
what are we doing?
But the minute they tell you you can't.
Yeah.

391
00:22:16.151 --> 00:22:18.040
There's a couple people who like,
yeah,
I want to do it,

392
00:22:18.041 --> 00:22:21.490
but it can't advertise you.
Why is that?
I don't know,
man.
That's silly.

393
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.760
That is silly.
I don't get that.
I don't get it either.

394
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.230
That was a big thing at the store.

395
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.980
People didn't want their names up on the marquee like why some comics who just

396
00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:33.130
like that ma'am.
But we're making it a whole big up block party.

397
00:22:33.131 --> 00:22:36.100
We're taking a whole like a parking lot of the Improv.

398
00:22:36.101 --> 00:22:38.880
We're going to have outside Djs,
dancers everywhere.

399
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.110
It's going to be a whole crazy ass thing.

400
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.290
The only thing that I could make that make sense to me about not wanting your

401
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:47.620
names,
if you're trying to a totally new shit and you want a completely neutral

402
00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:50.320
audience,
like you don't want people that are there for you.

403
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.560
They might give you a little bit of extra juice that you don't deserve the bit

404
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.371
you don't want to do.

405
00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:57.160
Say you don't want to work at any new material in front of your crowd cause you

406
00:22:57.161 --> 00:22:59.560
know that they're going to laugh at it.
You want to try different.

407
00:22:59.561 --> 00:23:00.700
That is a possibility.

408
00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:05.730
There is that and is also that you might not want to do it for your crop because

409
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:06.970
it's not ready yet.

410
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.390
So you feel like I'm okay to do it in front of these random folks,

411
00:23:10.391 --> 00:23:14.620
but people are paying to see me.
The bits aren't ready yet.
Is that a hard thing?

412
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.330
It could be that.
Some bits,
some bits are just weird man.

413
00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:21.340
Some bids they come together like I like,

414
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.430
I've got a few bits that literally like the day I wrote them,

415
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.960
they were done at least in a basic structural form.

416
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:32.470
But there's other ones like they're always moving them around.

417
00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:36.190
I put the end in the beginning,
the beginning and the end and know it's funny.

418
00:23:36.191 --> 00:23:38.740
You're like there's something there.
I just got to mine it to get it.

419
00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.410
[inaudible] got this one right now,
man,
I got this one right now.

420
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.960
It either kills or it sucks a fat dick man.
No,

421
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.810
I know like when it's in the middle,

422
00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:51.470
whether or not it's going to be one or the other and I know that I have to stick

423
00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:54.590
with it even if it's sucking a fat dick and try to find the way out.
Now,

424
00:23:54.591 --> 00:23:56.600
do you recall,
you say you record it.

425
00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.840
Is it ever like a certain word makes it go different?

426
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:04.160
I find like sometimes when I say it one way it blows up and then if I forget to

427
00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:07.010
do that way,
just fucking flat lines of the room.

428
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.770
Sometimes it's hard to see when you're the guy doing it too.

429
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:12.590
Like you need to like step back and listened to it.

430
00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.620
And when you listen to it and you're all quiet,
you're not saying a word,

431
00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:19.370
you listening to yourself.
Sometimes you go,
oh that comes out wrong.
You know,

432
00:24:19.371 --> 00:24:21.590
I met,
it sounds more like this.

433
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:26.480
Or maybe people would could possibly think that instead of this or you know,

434
00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:31.250
it's just good to listen to it.
It's not fun.
It's not enjoyable,
you know?

435
00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:32.360
But like if I'm,

436
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.000
especially if I'm on a plane or something like that and I got to go somewhere,

437
00:24:35.001 --> 00:24:38.680
I just listened to my sets.
Like we were talking earlier about like,
uh,

438
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.890
getting really rusty.

439
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.790
The thing that saves you from getting really rusty is listing to sets,
listening,

440
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.600
going over the beds,
making notes.
Then once you start doing it,

441
00:24:47.601 --> 00:24:50.390
it'll kind of come out naturally.
I think you're totally right.

442
00:24:50.391 --> 00:24:54.440
I should do it more.
I don't know why I don't.
I just,

443
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.130
I just liked to do it organically and I think it's a horrible cause.

444
00:24:58.131 --> 00:25:01.190
You're a lazy bitch dude.
You'd say I'm a lazy bitch.
It's that.

445
00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:05.660
The first thing you said that I just,
I work,
I got million irons going.

446
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.240
Hmm,
I'm just going a million irons going from the moment I wake up to the mom,

447
00:25:09.241 --> 00:25:11.120
I go to bed.
I'm just working these irons.

448
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.410
But you're also working some irons that are unnecessary in comparison to that

449
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:19.130
iron,
maybe iron of sitting and listening to material.
But that requires,

450
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.410
that's actually like work.
It's like writing,

451
00:25:21.411 --> 00:25:22.970
like sitting in front of a computer and writing.

452
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.910
There's a lot of friends that I know that a really good comedians that don't

453
00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:30.620
ever do that and they just can't add out themselves enough to sit in front of a

454
00:25:30.621 --> 00:25:33.560
laptop and just right or sit in front of a notebook and just,
right.

455
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.740
They can't do it.
So they come up with all these excuses.
I,
I,

456
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.550
I write in my head like I've found it.
If I put it down,
it takes away.

457
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.630
It just something in the delivery isn't the same one.
I structure it out.

458
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.070
But what I do is,
you know,
cause I've this be driving around taking care.

459
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.710
I just worked a bit in my head over and over again and over and I'll try to go

460
00:25:51.711 --> 00:25:54.710
up on stage.
What about three or four new jokes with it,

461
00:25:54.711 --> 00:25:58.790
kind of beat it out and then I let kind of the crowd kind of feel it and I just

462
00:25:58.791 --> 00:26:02.990
kind of go with it.
But I don't necessarily sit down and type.
I wish I could,

463
00:26:02.991 --> 00:26:03.824
I just,

464
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.190
I'll write down in my joke premise this prince prince dependent premise and I'll

465
00:26:07.191 --> 00:26:10.040
work them out in my head and then I'll go on stage and I'd be like,

466
00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:13.760
okay that works.
That doesn't work.
And I make mental notes in my head.

467
00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:17.000
Well I definitely have done that before and I think that if that works for you,

468
00:26:17.001 --> 00:26:19.940
it's all really about how much focus you're putting into it.

469
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.940
If your focus is you just sitting in there,

470
00:26:21.941 --> 00:26:25.730
going over it and redoing it over and over again in your head and then just

471
00:26:25.731 --> 00:26:29.540
writing down the premise.
I think that's basically just like writing.

472
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.510
It's just you're not actually putting it down on a piece of paper.

473
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.810
The one thing about writing though is they say that especially physically

474
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:38.150
writing like pen and paper and not,
not just typing.

475
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.770
When you physically write something,
it helps memory retention and aids.

476
00:26:42.771 --> 00:26:46.380
Like quite a bit like the,
I always um,
if you look at my notebook,

477
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.680
like from my comedy notebook,
it looks like I'm a crazy person.

478
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.680
I'm sure it's the same thing written over and over and over and over and over

479
00:26:52.681 --> 00:26:53.790
again.
It's like all work.

480
00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:57.300
No play makes jack a dull boy because that's what I do when I'm,

481
00:26:57.301 --> 00:26:59.850
when I'm writing my,
my bits out before a show,

482
00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:05.030
I'm just trying to get the key components like seared into my brain and then

483
00:27:05.641 --> 00:27:08.530
from there I,
right,
right.
I like that.

484
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.990
<v 2>I know that about you.
I wish I could do that.
It's just,</v>

485
00:27:11.991 --> 00:27:15.620
I've tried to be like the guy who sits down like I'm going to write this out and

486
00:27:15.621 --> 00:27:19.310
then go on stage.
He just does it.
Just something gets lost in translation.

487
00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.600
But I just,
I mean I'm talking to myself in my head constantly.

488
00:27:23.601 --> 00:27:26.660
My I used to do when I worked at the standard hotel,

489
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.630
they used to think I was crazy guy and the Hispanic,
uh,

490
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:35.360
maid service wouldn't sit next to me during lunch because they would see me

491
00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.630
talking to myself all day just working on the bit,

492
00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:43.250
acting it out just to get through the day of this job that I was very thankful

493
00:27:43.251 --> 00:27:46.260
for,
but it was killing my soul.
But that's how I would get through today day.

494
00:27:46.261 --> 00:27:48.530
Just working on these bits,
playing them out my head.

495
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.830
And then by the time I got on stage,
I would have

496
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:55.910
<v 3>somewhat crafted bit Ra onstage.
Yeah,
I used to do that when I drove limos.</v>

497
00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.480
I used to drive around and pretend like I was doing the bid I was,
I was driving.

498
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:02.270
I find that like when you're doing certain tasks,

499
00:28:02.271 --> 00:28:04.940
like especially driving with no radio on,

500
00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.380
driving with no radio on is a good thing to do and not enough people do it,

501
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.430
but just driving around and just thinking like sometimes you can figure some

502
00:28:13.431 --> 00:28:17.750
shit out and you have ideas that come to you because you're not being inundated

503
00:28:17.751 --> 00:28:19.550
by constant ideas of other people,

504
00:28:19.551 --> 00:28:22.730
whether it's advertisements or songs you don't really want to hear.

505
00:28:22.731 --> 00:28:26.600
And changing channels,
deciding what the,
listen to silence.

506
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:29.780
Just drive sometimes and the ideas can come to you.

507
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.030
<v 2>I completely agree with that.</v>

508
00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.810
I've been now trying to talk more stories on stage and it's a little,

509
00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:40.000
it's a transition.
It's not as easy as I thought it was going to be,

510
00:28:40.001 --> 00:28:43.270
but you got to just work through it.
And now that you know,
I've been on stage,

511
00:28:43.271 --> 00:28:46.480
I'm trying to be a little more honest with what's gone in my life because I've

512
00:28:46.481 --> 00:28:47.950
had a crazy life,
what,
you know,

513
00:28:47.951 --> 00:28:52.120
what my drug problem and all that stuff and that just all the crazy places I put

514
00:28:52.121 --> 00:28:55.110
myself into and all that stuff.
And you know,

515
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.650
the crowds have really been reacting to it really well,
man.
I'm really impressed.

516
00:28:59.651 --> 00:29:03.400
Like,
you know,
the comments I'm getting on stage.
This is something

517
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:07.150
<v 3>you've done.
This is the first time you've done this.
I've been,
yeah.</v>

518
00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.150
And how many years you've been doing standup now?
15.
So,
um,

519
00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.530
within like 14 years in is when you started getting this change?

520
00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:17.970
<v 2>Yeah,
man,
I,
I,
you know,
it was a combination of like,</v>

521
00:29:17.971 --> 00:29:20.460
I'd start talking about something and then like,
you know,

522
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.370
three months later I'd see everybody talking about it and not that they're

523
00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:27.750
taking from me,
just,
you know,
it's in the,
you know,
the,
the air.
So I'm like,
ah,

524
00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.150
I want to do something different.
So I'm like,

525
00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:33.630
I got all these crazy stories of my life,
you know,

526
00:29:33.631 --> 00:29:35.760
that I just never talked about on stage.

527
00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:39.210
And just getting to the place where I'm comfortable with being honest about,

528
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:42.160
you know,
all the crazy shit that happened to me and you know,

529
00:29:42.161 --> 00:29:44.200
and just going on stage and see now reaction,

530
00:29:44.201 --> 00:29:47.590
even if it doesn't get a laugh necessarily.
And it does,

531
00:29:47.591 --> 00:29:50.170
it gets some of the stuff's real real,
you know,

532
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.690
it just builds this kind of credibility with the crowd that th the,

533
00:29:53.691 --> 00:29:55.240
the goal with me on other stuff,

534
00:29:55.241 --> 00:30:00.040
like it's a vulnerability but it's also you being a real person as opposed to a

535
00:30:00.041 --> 00:30:04.510
guy putting on a show and putting on the shows like the armor that you throw up

536
00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:06.650
when you first started doing stand up,
you know,

537
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.250
I had a breaking point the other day where,
you know,

538
00:30:09.251 --> 00:30:14.251
is that the store and I was just watching a bunch of funny comics go up but

539
00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:16.840
nobody was being real on and I,
I'm,

540
00:30:16.841 --> 00:30:19.810
I'm not taking anything away from them because there was some really funny young

541
00:30:19.811 --> 00:30:23.530
comics coming up that I really enjoy,
but I just found with comedy,

542
00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.770
everybody wants to hear what they already know.

543
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.720
They want to really laugh.

544
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:32.980
Like it's gotten so much about relate-ability to the point,
you know,
that it's,

545
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.090
I just feel like it's like people want to,

546
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.940
people want to hear premises about stuff we all already agree upon and I just

547
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:42.820
don't want to do that stuff.
So I've been really breaking through and it can get,

548
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:46.510
it could be a hard place when you're doing this.
Really.
Okay.
But is that,

549
00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:50.980
is it that people want that or is that's what they're being fed?
Well,

550
00:30:50.981 --> 00:30:54.310
I think they're being fed because that's what they see most comfortable about.

551
00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:58.600
Or that's what gets the biggest reaction.
That's all it is.

552
00:30:58.601 --> 00:31:00.460
It's what it's with gets the biggest reaction.

553
00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:03.150
So people do it because they want to get that reaction.
Right.

554
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.620
So you start getting that,
you know,
hey man,

555
00:31:05.621 --> 00:31:07.780
you remember when you were in school and you know you're right.
A No.

556
00:31:07.781 --> 00:31:12.760
Do you like me check yes or no?
Yeah.
People remember that.
Exactly.

557
00:31:12.761 --> 00:31:17.530
So it's not even really that funny,
but it's very relatable.
Very relatable.

558
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.410
But that's not,
I mean it's also so sometimes it's funny,

559
00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:23.530
I mean sometimes it's a real moment that someone's trying to recall from.

560
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.870
I know what you're saying though.
I know that that the thing where you're,

561
00:31:26.871 --> 00:31:31.000
you're seeing a lot of like jokey joke type shit and you're like,

562
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.640
you're longing for Richard Pryor type bags.

563
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:37.120
You wrong longing for someone to go up there and just take it to another level,

564
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.070
which is why like I,
you know,

565
00:31:39.071 --> 00:31:42.760
after a long time of resisting the late night spots at the comedy store,

566
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.440
I very much embrace them now because there's a lot more room for me just to

567
00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.660
experiment.
And if I fail,
I fail.
If it goes well,
goes well and bub.

568
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.550
But when a hits,
it's like it's gold.
Yeah.
Those 10 rule,

569
00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.420
10 people rooms,
you know,

570
00:31:58.421 --> 00:32:00.670
it's like one o'clock in the morning and you finally get on stage and they've

571
00:32:00.671 --> 00:32:04.810
seen everything.
If you can make those motherfuckers laugh blood from a stone,

572
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:09.220
you got something right.
And it's like running with weights on.
I uh,

573
00:32:09.221 --> 00:32:11.350
I was doing the main room,
you know,
I've been blessed,

574
00:32:11.351 --> 00:32:14.470
I've been gigging law on the road,
but I've been a,
you know,

575
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.650
I'll do a couple of weekends at the comedy store and I,
you know,

576
00:32:17.651 --> 00:32:19.030
I get the last spot in the main room,

577
00:32:19.031 --> 00:32:21.970
which is where I can do like an hour if I want to.
And,

578
00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:26.050
and just last week it was a great crowd.
By the end of the night,
I'm going up.

579
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.540
Usually my Saturday spot is Sunday,

580
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:33.430
so I'll go up around like 1245 and the crowd was still there and they were

581
00:32:33.431 --> 00:32:35.740
great.
But right when I walk on the stage,

582
00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:39.230
these two dudes in the front row just jumped me.
You know,

583
00:32:39.231 --> 00:32:42.320
they're just trying to heckle me,
ray right out the gate and I'm,

584
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.420
I'm very blessed.
I've been doing comedy long enough that I'm real,

585
00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.900
I'm dead on the inside,
you know,
it's like Burntwood at this point.
Yeah,

586
00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:51.740
there's no real reaction.
You're getting me.

587
00:32:51.741 --> 00:32:54.590
So everything you thrown at me is a waste and I'm just going to hit you with

588
00:32:54.591 --> 00:32:59.510
everything.
So I mean,
I'm just hitting these dude.
Damn,
the crowd is going nuts.

589
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:04.430
I mean,
just going pause,
break at like at like 1245 at night,
12 boom,

590
00:33:04.431 --> 00:33:08.870
boom,
boom.
This guy,
I don't know,
I just say something.
I go,
where's your wife?

591
00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:10.260
He goes at home.
I'm like,
yeah,

592
00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:14.120
buried in the backyard and the place goes nuts and he just turns,
he's like,

593
00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:18.290
really?
Motherfucker.
Really?
And he just starts going nuts.
He gets up.

594
00:33:18.291 --> 00:33:22.130
He tried to grab his drink and throw it at me.
His friend grabs his arm,
stops it.

595
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:27.280
So he starts walking out and man this dude grabs a chair and tried to throw it

596
00:33:28.011 --> 00:33:32.090
at me on stage and luckily his friends got it cause it was going to hit somebody

597
00:33:32.091 --> 00:33:35.900
in the front row.
But I just get this weird reaction out of these people.

598
00:33:35.901 --> 00:33:39.230
They try to like her.
My store though to the store is,

599
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.480
I had two people throw drinks at me at the store.

600
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.270
One guy threw a bottle of water and me and one guy threw a glass at me.

601
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.360
Yeah and you got dark,
dark,
dark place man.

602
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.240
First of all there's zero crowd control.

603
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:55.610
They're all comedians have to do their own crowd control and you have to like

604
00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.160
kick people out.
The only guy who used to kick people out was Harris.
Pete,

605
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.190
crazy Harris.
Pete.
I had more,

606
00:34:01.191 --> 00:34:03.560
I've had more people were moved from the comic store than any other place I've

607
00:34:03.561 --> 00:34:06.620
ever played ever.
It was so bad that,
and it would fuck with everybody.

608
00:34:06.621 --> 00:34:09.980
So like there'd be such evil moments there that I would buy the entire room

609
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:13.460
dramas that I did that several times.
I remember that because it was like,
look,

610
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:14.750
you know,
we're all in this together.

611
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:17.360
I'm not trying to make him money here just so you can't be an asshole.

612
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:21.020
All the door guys look like they're in some email band that has keyboardist and

613
00:34:21.021 --> 00:34:22.430
triangles and it's just like,

614
00:34:22.431 --> 00:34:26.480
it's like death cab for Cutie is security for the Er.
I'm like,
Yo Dude,

615
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:28.490
who's securing Yoo Hoo man.

616
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:33.520
Tight pants and knit skinny jeans and it can have sold too low crying.

617
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.320
You know,
it just like,
it's crazy.

618
00:34:36.321 --> 00:34:39.920
So I mean I've had a couple instances of that,
man,

619
00:34:39.921 --> 00:34:42.530
I just don't have security there.
They really don't have security.

620
00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:45.770
Not Real security.
I just don't know why they just don't get the,

621
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:50.240
you remember Dublin's had that big black security guard?

622
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:51.840
I see black,
you have to mention that.
Yeah.

623
00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:56.240
Well cause was I called them deep space.
He was so big and black.
It was,

624
00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:59.510
I've never seen a human being with this bigger hands in my life.

625
00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.480
That's the guy you need when you need something.

626
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.290
The comic store doesn't have anything.
I mean,
do they have any security?
Nothing.

627
00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:11.390
Is there a one guy who's like a big guy who's trained in the arts?

628
00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.930
Don Lewis was last of the Badass door guys.

629
00:35:14.931 --> 00:35:19.630
He was this guy who with this comic who just knew like karate at a black belt.

630
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:24.140
Karate and was a big yoke dude too.
Yeah,
the Houston,
the day he used the date.

631
00:35:24.141 --> 00:35:29.120
That's like six eight basketball player.
That's a good size.
Yeah.

632
00:35:29.121 --> 00:35:33.470
For for gladiator baby.
Alright.
Don Lewis and some six eight white chick.

633
00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:37.070
It would be great,
but I've seen taken on three dudes at one time.
Yeah,

634
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.040
you have to at

635
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.110
<v 3>that place.
Sometimes you have,
they're all drunk though.</v>

636
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.510
By the time you get in a fight with somebody at the comedy store,
you usually,

637
00:35:42.511 --> 00:35:45.480
they're beyond hammered,
but Dunkin brought it up.
It's like,

638
00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:48.660
how do you feel when you're the guy that goes after the comedian,

639
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:51.990
like the guy just trying to make you laugh and have a good time.

640
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.920
You go after him and tried to physically assaulted and it's like,
what is that?

641
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.720
Well it's also Hollywood.

642
00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.380
Part of it is Hollywood itself because you get a disproportionate amount of

643
00:36:01.381 --> 00:36:04.740
people who think they deserve way more attention than they're getting.

644
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.860
Like this is the place where they congregate.
This is the flow.

645
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:11.430
This is the light that draws the malls.
This is the place.

646
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:15.630
So they come here and one of the things that they want to do is prove that

647
00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:16.620
they're better than everybody else.

648
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.110
You ever talked to someone who's like a really weak comedian?

649
00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:21.030
It's sort of just starting out and like,
you know,

650
00:36:21.031 --> 00:36:25.170
we're going to fucking own this town.
Did you ever see that movie?
Um,
uh,

651
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.190
overnight over here overnight.

652
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.750
It's a fucking brilliant movie about this very thing.

653
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:35.990
It's about a guy who is the director of boondock saints who wrote and directed

654
00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:40.860
Boondock Saints and they produced this movie where they initially,

655
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:42.210
when they started following him,

656
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.450
he had just gotten this huge development deal cause he wrote the script.

657
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.130
Harvey Weinstein bought it.

658
00:36:47.131 --> 00:36:50.760
They bought the bar where he worked in as a bartender and now it's his bar and

659
00:36:50.761 --> 00:36:53.790
this whole thing and he's overnight success.
Okay,

660
00:36:53.791 --> 00:36:58.791
well you watched this guy like become like the most bloated asshole because of

661
00:37:00.931 --> 00:37:04.500
all the success that he's having and all this adulation and is getting,

662
00:37:04.501 --> 00:37:08.550
he believes his own hype and tailspins and the whole thing is,

663
00:37:08.551 --> 00:37:10.890
it's really fascinating to watch.
Really,

664
00:37:10.891 --> 00:37:15.180
really fascinating to watch cause it guy becomes just a fucking asshole for no

665
00:37:15.181 --> 00:37:16.020
reason.
You know,

666
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:20.610
when I used to work at a crunch gene Simmons wife used to go work out there and

667
00:37:20.611 --> 00:37:23.070
she was talking to me about fame and she said,

668
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:27.870
what's the name of the lead singer kiss?
Uh,
Paul Stanley.
Paul Stanley.
She said,

669
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:31.200
Paul Stanley told her that fame doesn't change you.

670
00:37:31.201 --> 00:37:35.250
Fame just amplifies whoever you are by a thousand times.

671
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.110
Well this guy just decided that he was Billy Badass and he was the baddest

672
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.490
mother fucker when a fucking own this time there was all that.

673
00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.710
They'd never seen a fucking group of talent like us.

674
00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.810
We're a triple threat were the,
you know,
it was all this,

675
00:37:45.811 --> 00:37:49.320
like it wouldn't be like,
Hey,
I think we're going to have careers,

676
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.710
we're going to be successful.
We're lucky.
We got chance to make a good film.

677
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:55.080
I'm really thinking we would make a good film.
It wasn't the end of that.

678
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.840
It was all we're going to fucking dominate.
We're going to own,

679
00:37:57.841 --> 00:38:01.040
we're going to take over this town.
And um,
the whole,

680
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:06.060
it's a fascinating piece on watching the reaction to this guy.

681
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:09.370
Like he gets huge and all this,
you know,

682
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:13.800
he has all this arrogance and then it all implodes on them and you get to see

683
00:38:13.801 --> 00:38:16.050
like the,
the,
the aftermath of it.

684
00:38:16.051 --> 00:38:21.051
And it's a really interesting psychology or psychological sort of a,

685
00:38:22.051 --> 00:38:25.050
uh,
like a profile.
Like it's,
it's an,

686
00:38:25.051 --> 00:38:28.620
it's an interesting documentation of a process.

687
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:33.480
The process of hitting unfathomable heights,
of winning the lottery basically.

688
00:38:33.481 --> 00:38:37.590
Yeah.
And that's,
you get that a lot like onsets.

689
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.510
Like you hear that a lot about what you'll hear it about certain actors,

690
00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:44.320
it's scream and everybody on the sat,
you know,
where's my fucking water and this,

691
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.480
you know,
like throw scripts.
It like some,
I don't want to say who it was,

692
00:38:49.481 --> 00:38:54.481
but she threw her coke in the face of the executive producer on my gut.

693
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.820
If you fuck your wife the way you,
right,

694
00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:02.170
it's no wonder why you're getting a divorce.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

695
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.250
Don't you think that has to do with how early almost you get it?
No,

696
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.460
I think it's just some people,
just the pressure.
First of all,

697
00:39:09.461 --> 00:39:14.140
the pressure of being on like,
like some shit,
like let's say like,

698
00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:16.540
okay,
let's go with a home improvement.

699
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.810
When home improvement was the number one show in the country,

700
00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:24.490
the pressure must be madness.
It must be madness.

701
00:39:24.491 --> 00:39:28.450
Like the reason why Charlie Sheen cracks like that,
don't you think?

702
00:39:28.451 --> 00:39:31.360
Part of that is the pressure of just being Charlie Sheen.

703
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:35.380
Just the pressure of being on it's gigantic fucking hit Sitcom and everywhere

704
00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:38.300
you go people are following you with cameras and just want to do coke.
Yes.

705
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:42.040
Want to go fucking Tracy [inaudible] was there a lot of pressure when you were

706
00:39:42.041 --> 00:39:45.310
doing like a fear factor that will read it?
No,
not well,

707
00:39:45.311 --> 00:39:46.270
there's definite a lot of pressure,

708
00:39:46.271 --> 00:39:48.750
but it wasn't the same thing cause I wasn't really that famous.
It was a day.

709
00:39:48.751 --> 00:39:51.340
It was like fear factor was famous.
I was just the host.
It's like,

710
00:39:51.341 --> 00:39:55.360
you know like the guy who was a host of survivor.
What's his name?
Greg.
Jeff.

711
00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.200
Jeff Probst.
Yeah,
Jeff Probst.
When you watch Jeff probes,

712
00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:02.770
like you don't think like,
Oh,
this is Jeff [inaudible].
It's like,
oh,

713
00:40:02.771 --> 00:40:06.760
there's that guy who's survivors,
survivors.
So fear factor was the big show.

714
00:40:06.761 --> 00:40:10.090
I was just the host.
The host has not only being Charlie Sheen,

715
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.820
that's a different level kind of psychosis.

716
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:17.500
Can't go anywhere without people going,
oh shit,
Charlie Jane,
Yo man,

717
00:40:17.501 --> 00:40:18.670
I like rocks too.

718
00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:22.540
He's got that right kind of fame I talk about and onstage where it's like he's

719
00:40:22.541 --> 00:40:26.530
above it.
Meaning like no matter what he does,
we're cool with it.

720
00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:31.480
I mean the guy locked the porn star in the bathroom after smoking crack and got

721
00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.910
a huge TV deal with FX.

722
00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.800
Anybody else that's taken them down by,

723
00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:40.000
he's just at that level where it's like he's above it.

724
00:40:40.001 --> 00:40:43.270
I mean he's got a new movie coming out.
I like him.
I liked those kinds of,

725
00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:46.940
it's not,
it's not that he's above it.
He owns it.
That's who he is,

726
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:47.950
who he accepted.

727
00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:50.800
The real problem is when someone pretends to be something they're not.

728
00:40:50.801 --> 00:40:53.230
If someone pretends to be like a Ted Haggard type dude,

729
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:57.100
pretends to be this very pious religious leader who was trying to show people

730
00:40:57.101 --> 00:41:00.610
the way.
Meanwhile he's smoking meth and getting gay hookers.
That's,

731
00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.050
that's what people have a problem with.

732
00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.680
It's not smoking meth and gang gay hookers.
Cause if,
you know,

733
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:09.850
if George Michael did it and it was just like honest about it,
like look,

734
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:11.200
I got a lot of money.

735
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.590
I really liked math and I like hookers and how the big boys,

736
00:41:14.591 --> 00:41:16.120
they know what they're doing.
They know what to do.

737
00:41:16.121 --> 00:41:19.240
We're having a good time here on your shit.
Yeah,
there's no problem.

738
00:41:19.241 --> 00:41:21.010
Nobody has a problem with male prostitution.

739
00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.960
Everybody's trying to stop prostitution,

740
00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:26.740
but nobody puts any effort whatsoever to stopping male prostitution.

741
00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.860
There's no campaigns.
There's no billboards.

742
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:34.070
There's fucking a lot of counseling to stop prostitution on the female side,

743
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:39.050
we see the terrible,
these girls are getting used.
This is terrible.

744
00:41:39.051 --> 00:41:42.110
They're being victimized and degraded.
Nobody cares about the boys.

745
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.880
They did not care.
Those guys are sucking dicks all day long for cash.

746
00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:49.220
Nobody cares.
It all because no one's looking out for men.

747
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:50.960
No one's looking out for men in this country.

748
00:41:50.961 --> 00:41:55.790
You remember fat Eddie that you hang out at the comedy store?
A Mexican guy,

749
00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.200
great guy.

750
00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:01.160
It was his birthday and like everyone's buying him shots and it kind of goes

751
00:42:01.161 --> 00:42:04.220
along the lines like everybody's protecting women.

752
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:07.280
You can't protect women enough no matter what.

753
00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:10.910
Like if a woman gets just shit face,
you're like,
you don't have to do this.

754
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:15.230
You don't have to do this.
Listen,
no,
go home.
Listen,

755
00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.230
we're worried about you.
You're too drunk.
Something bad's going to happen.
Dude.

756
00:42:18.231 --> 00:42:22.700
Eddie's doing shots.
He's so drunk.
He's like,
I want to go to La.
Well,

757
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.910
I forget the name of the nightclub,
which after hours,
so we'll go there.

758
00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:28.910
Nobody's like,
Eddie,
don't do it.
Where like you us to drop you off by yourself.

759
00:42:28.911 --> 00:42:33.620
He's like,
yeah,
the guy's throwing up on the side of the car.
Nobody cares.

760
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:37.280
Nobody cares at all.
Eddie might die in the dumpster.
Yeah.

761
00:42:37.281 --> 00:42:41.390
Nobody cares about male porn.
Nobody cares about male prostitution.

762
00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:46.310
Nobody's looking out from men.
Period.
I got called a men's rights Dodo,

763
00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.370
Mra Dodo by this chick.
It was,

764
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.200
we're talking about like someone was,

765
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.880
the tweet has something to do with feminism and someone called me a male rights

766
00:42:55.881 --> 00:43:00.410
Dodo and I was like,
what does that even mean?
I had to look up Mra,

767
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.940
it's male rights advocate or male rights activists.
And I was like,
wow.

768
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:09.830
So someone who's a feminist can make fun of someone who's a male rights
activist.

769
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:14.690
That's hilarious.
Like just that,
that you would do that like a cross the board.

770
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.000
Massive generalization.
Male rights average.
That's like saying no.

771
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:21.680
Men Don't need any more help.
Like,
oh no,
no,
no,
we're not going to allow that.
No,

772
00:43:21.681 --> 00:43:24.470
we want a feminism.
But no help for men,

773
00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.640
like as if there aren't some crow Raisie divorce laws.

774
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.080
Everybody's hard cores.
Ridiculous,
brutal,

775
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:37.460
terrifying divorces where the men were essentially targeted,
targeted,

776
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:41.720
roped in,
sucked in scammed and d and no one's looking out for those guys.

777
00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:42.950
I can't,
knowing there's,

778
00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:48.140
it's almost acceptable in this country for women to try to get pregnant by

779
00:43:48.141 --> 00:43:52.220
famous guys.
Like it's an acceptable practice that will listen and they say,

780
00:43:52.221 --> 00:43:54.590
Lou [inaudible],
she,
she should know better.
He should know better.

781
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.630
Maybe he should.
You're right.
Maybe you should,

782
00:43:56.870 --> 00:44:01.870
but it's not cute to support what's essentially criminal behavior.
If someone,

783
00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.570
someone's doing that,
it's criminal behavior.
I you know it,
I know it.

784
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:08.180
It's kind of weird.
You know,
a great example,

785
00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.990
what you're talking about is like anytime you hear a story about a woman cutting

786
00:44:11.991 --> 00:44:13.550
a man's privates off,

787
00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:18.170
you hear women laughing about that constantly.
I don't know about that.

788
00:44:18.171 --> 00:44:22.250
I've never heard a woman,
our girls joke about it,
that they think it's hilarious.

789
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:26.270
Maybe a really dumb ones that you're hanging around with who I choose to hang

790
00:44:26.271 --> 00:44:30.670
out with.
But you hear people laugh about that.
If it went the other way,
no buddy.

791
00:44:30.671 --> 00:44:32.970
It would be like,
dude,
that's not cool.
I agree.

792
00:44:32.971 --> 00:44:37.080
There'd be way more outrage if a guy cut off a woman's pussy,
like cut it out,

793
00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:38.183
scooped it out,

794
00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.480
which there should be outraged but it should be outraged both way.

795
00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:45.720
I mean the cut off a mans genitals and like put it in a blender is like

796
00:44:45.721 --> 00:44:47.520
horrific.
It is horrific.

797
00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.670
That lady was really evil and whether she was a man or a woman,

798
00:44:50.671 --> 00:44:53.580
that's just someone being evil to a person.
And that's kind of my point.

799
00:44:53.581 --> 00:44:56.430
It's like,
why wouldn't you be a male rights advocate?

800
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:58.980
What about that guy that got arrested for rape?

801
00:44:58.981 --> 00:45:03.120
Did four years in jail and it turned out that the girl was lying and now she has

802
00:45:03.121 --> 00:45:05.760
to do two months and she gets to do it on the weekends.

803
00:45:05.761 --> 00:45:09.030
We talked about it the other day.
It's a,
it's a terrible case.
This poor man,

804
00:45:09.031 --> 00:45:12.390
he was just the neighbor and the girl got caught watching pornography by her

805
00:45:12.391 --> 00:45:12.661
mother.

806
00:45:12.661 --> 00:45:16.230
So she concocted this story that she was sexually assaulted and she said that

807
00:45:16.231 --> 00:45:20.130
the story just got bigger and bigger and bigger until it spiraled out of
control.

808
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:23.820
We talked to a guy on Greg Fitzsimmons show the other day who was accused

809
00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:27.840
falsely accused of rape and he went to jail for six years before the woman

810
00:45:27.841 --> 00:45:30.130
finally we're Canton.
He has zero repercussion.

811
00:45:30.131 --> 00:45:32.400
You never got a dime from the state.
All he got was in typology.

812
00:45:32.401 --> 00:45:36.600
The woman never did a day of time and it was a woman who he just got drunk with

813
00:45:36.601 --> 00:45:39.810
and she didn't want to tell her boyfriend that she cheated on him.

814
00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:43.110
So she made up a story about getting raped.
Famous others,

815
00:45:43.111 --> 00:45:47.340
a football player who just got on Seattle.
Yeah,
it was in jail for five years.

816
00:45:47.341 --> 00:45:50.310
He was going to be like a five star athlete at USC.
Yeah,

817
00:45:50.311 --> 00:45:51.750
and the same is the same situation.

818
00:45:51.751 --> 00:45:56.160
There's no repercussion if you're not a male rights advocate in those instances.

819
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:59.190
You're not a human,
you're not a humanist.
You don't care.

820
00:45:59.191 --> 00:46:02.820
You care about women more than you care about the human race as a whole.

821
00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:07.020
And the human rights is a whole,
absolutely.
Women need to be protected.

822
00:46:07.021 --> 00:46:11.790
But guess what?
So do everyone.
So does every baby,
so does every adult.

823
00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:15.420
So it was a young boy.
When a boy is five,
do you protect them?

824
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:19.300
How about 10 how about 20 it's 20 is where you stop.
That's ridiculous.

825
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:23.550
We're human beings and that's what you're dealing with is someone lying and

826
00:46:23.551 --> 00:46:24.780
ruining someone's life.

827
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:28.680
And that can happen on both sides and you shouldn't eat the idea that you could

828
00:46:28.681 --> 00:46:31.680
do like make fun of someone who's like,
look y'all for men's rights.

829
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:32.850
That's so gross.

830
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:37.970
If someone made fun of Feminists v the values and ideas of the true values,

831
00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:42.970
ideas of equality in terms of law and employment,
nondiscrimination,

832
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:43.650
all those things.

833
00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:47.340
If someone actually made fun of that just because they didn't like women,

834
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:50.940
that would be disgusting.
It would be disgusting and misogynistic.

835
00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:55.680
But a woman can say that like male rights dodo or male rights advocate dummies

836
00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:56.611
like that.

837
00:46:56.611 --> 00:47:01.230
Did the completely dismiss the idea that there should be someone looking out for

838
00:47:01.231 --> 00:47:05.880
men's rights.
But the idea is the problem is who's going to come forth and say,

839
00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:09.840
we need to change those laws?
Who's going to come forth and say,
listen,
if you,

840
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:12.180
if you wanted acute falsely accuse someone of rape,

841
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:15.190
you have to go to jail for the exact amount of time that you put in prison.

842
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:18.990
That great that you should you absolutely.
Why wouldn't that be?

843
00:47:18.991 --> 00:47:22.770
That only seems logical because they're not looking out for the human race

844
00:47:22.771 --> 00:47:24.860
they're looking at for team vagina first.
Yes.

845
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:27.840
And they will even say that so many women are victimized that,
you know,

846
00:47:27.841 --> 00:47:30.100
men should have to take the hit every now and then.

847
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:34.090
False accusations are acceptable as long as we limit the amount because there's

848
00:47:34.091 --> 00:47:37.480
so they pale in comparison to the amount of women that are raped.

849
00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.240
That's sort of maybe true,
but it's not.
It's not.

850
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.860
It doesn't make them any less bad.

851
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:46.850
I am still really bad and it fucks up the entire positive side of it.
Right.

852
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:49.510
It fucks up the entire pro woman side of it.

853
00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:54.640
If you're willing to ignore the fact that a guy is unjustly victimized.
Yeah.

854
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:55.540
I was talking,

855
00:47:55.570 --> 00:48:00.400
I had Tom like is some my pops and naughty show podcast and um,

856
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:01.361
he,
you know,

857
00:48:01.361 --> 00:48:05.650
he got in a lot of trouble because he would give out the names of the victims in

858
00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:09.520
these sexual stories when the stories coming out that they weren't being honest.

859
00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:10.690
And you know,

860
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:15.690
I personally don't think any name in a sexual assault case should be put out

861
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:19.900
until a final verdict comes out.
I don't know if that's realistic,
but I mean,

862
00:48:19.901 --> 00:48:22.690
especially in today when anybody can final verdict,

863
00:48:22.691 --> 00:48:25.350
like this guy's case where he's in jail for four years,
he could have eased.

864
00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:29.980
I mean he was essentially labeled as a rapist for four years.

865
00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:30.730
I mean,

866
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:34.180
when is it okay to talk about it then when it turns out four years later that it

867
00:48:34.181 --> 00:48:35.770
wasn't,
I agree with that.
I mean,

868
00:48:35.771 --> 00:48:39.460
personally I would like nobody's name to be put out at all because again,

869
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:42.430
you could find out later on that they are innocent.
But I mean,

870
00:48:42.431 --> 00:48:46.630
just the accusation towards a man,
TMZ,
we'll run with it.

871
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:47.800
If you're somewhat famous,

872
00:48:47.801 --> 00:48:51.790
they'll say your name bright lights everywhere and alleged victim and you never

873
00:48:51.791 --> 00:48:55.150
hear the name.
And I understand a point of that because you don't want,

874
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.760
you want women to come forward and not be afraid that their names can be

875
00:48:57.761 --> 00:48:58.594
splashed everywhere.

876
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:03.730
But let's not put the guy's name out until we actually know something down the

877
00:49:03.731 --> 00:49:05.050
line.
You know,
it's like,
it's interesting,

878
00:49:05.051 --> 00:49:08.170
but when you're in a position like say if you're a famous basketball player or

879
00:49:08.171 --> 00:49:11.440
something along those lines,
like there's no innocent until proven guilty,

880
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.070
there's accused them and then let them try to figure out how to exonerate

881
00:49:15.071 --> 00:49:19.390
themselves that it happens very often and a lot of the times it's just people

882
00:49:19.391 --> 00:49:21.190
that are crazy that are making things up.
You know,

883
00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:23.290
a lot of people don't know that Mike Tyson story.

884
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:24.910
When Mike Tyson went to jail for rape,

885
00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:29.710
did you know that the girl who accused him of rape also had a false accusation

886
00:49:29.711 --> 00:49:34.711
of rape that she had to drop a year before that she had made up a rape story a

887
00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:38.230
year before that?
Like this wasn't a new trick for her.
And I'm not saying that,

888
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.480
you know,
I don't know what happened or what didn't happen,

889
00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:45.400
but Mike Tyson is incredibly honest about his background.
Like what he did wrong,

890
00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:49.090
what he did right,
how he was feeling,
why he did the things he did.

891
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.930
And he maintains his day that he did not rape because one man show at the

892
00:49:52.931 --> 00:49:55.540
pantageous.
It was phenomenal to say about that.

893
00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.990
What did he say about the way that he didn't do it?
To this day,
he never did it.

894
00:49:58.991 --> 00:50:01.510
He has no reason not to lie about it right now.
He's like,

895
00:50:01.511 --> 00:50:05.080
I'm being honest about everything else.
I have no reason to lie right now.

896
00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:09.400
I believe him and he went to jail for that.
And I'm not saying that it wasn't,

897
00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.590
you know,
like Mike Tyson was out of control.

898
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:15.100
Not saying it wasn't a case where there was a guy who was just like scaring the

899
00:50:15.101 --> 00:50:18.940
fuck out of people.
He was,
he looked,
you know,

900
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.110
put yourself in his shoes,

901
00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:23.290
listen to his explanations of his life and you kind of understand where he was

902
00:50:23.291 --> 00:50:26.830
coming from.
I mean,
I,
I think for sure it was a very,
very aggressive man.

903
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.970
But also for sure,
like how,

904
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:35.180
how aggressive could he have been that that is okay?

905
00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:36.870
I mean,
how aggressive is it a B?

906
00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:40.400
Cause he is he scary so it's okay to make up a lie about it.
I'm like,

907
00:50:40.401 --> 00:50:45.170
when is it okay?
It's not,
it's never okay man.
But to this day that happened,

908
00:50:45.171 --> 00:50:49.010
he went to jail and he's not the only guy.
It's happened to many people.
It is,

909
00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:51.500
it's definitely a,
you know,

910
00:50:51.501 --> 00:50:55.370
one way towards one group than the other and it's this horrible man.
I mean,

911
00:50:55.371 --> 00:50:58.670
you're ruining people's lives.
It doesn't have to be,
that's the real problem.

912
00:50:58.671 --> 00:51:03.560
I don't think it has to be only the people that,
you know,
the,
the,
like the,
the,

913
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.160
the female,
the weaker sex are the ones in the weak,

914
00:51:06.161 --> 00:51:09.970
weaker physically are the ones that get the,
you know,

915
00:51:09.971 --> 00:51:11.840
the get the compassion.
It should be,

916
00:51:11.841 --> 00:51:16.841
everybody should have compassion for term for women who are sexist against men.

917
00:51:17.721 --> 00:51:20.390
It's like miss stretch knee or something.
It's like,

918
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:25.370
I forget the name of the word,
but there's a label for it.
It's silly everybody,

919
00:51:25.371 --> 00:51:29.350
man,
I liked everybody.
I really am.
If they're nice,
right?

920
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:31.850
100% if you treat people like a human being,

921
00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:36.110
I'm totally open to you and I get it that women have to deal with a lot of

922
00:51:36.111 --> 00:51:40.520
Douchey guys.
I totally get it.
I get,
I've been a Douchey guy.
My my life.

923
00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:44.030
I think we all have trying to figure out who the fuck you are and you're 17 or

924
00:51:44.031 --> 00:51:47.240
18 or what have you growing up.
Maybe you're angry,
maybe you know,

925
00:51:47.241 --> 00:51:51.110
maybe somebody catches you on the wrong day.
We've all been wrong thing.

926
00:51:51.111 --> 00:51:53.240
It's part of like learning how to communicate with people,

927
00:51:53.241 --> 00:51:57.140
so I can imagine being a woman being pursued by a bunch of asshole,

928
00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:01.730
aggressive shitheads.
I could tell,
I mean it was never that,
but I could get that.

929
00:52:01.731 --> 00:52:05.240
I understand that.
I get why you would think that guy's disgusting.

930
00:52:05.241 --> 00:52:09.020
If somebody raped you.
I get why you would hate all men.
I totally get it.

931
00:52:09.021 --> 00:52:13.370
I totally get it,
but we're not all the same.
Like no one's all the same.

932
00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:17.270
There's nice women,
there's nice men,
there's nice people.

933
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:22.070
There's people that enjoy each other's company on both sides and both sexes.

934
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:27.200
And we have to unite as a,
as a race against Shitty,
angry,

935
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:32.000
nasty behavior.
I can will be great with Your v victimizing people.
The,

936
00:52:32.001 --> 00:52:33.710
all that stuff is the real issue.

937
00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:37.310
It's nothing to do with whether it's women to men or men to women.

938
00:52:37.311 --> 00:52:40.580
It's gross on both sides.
Scary on both sides.

939
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.570
A woman that's willing to poison her husband and killed him is just as scary as

940
00:52:44.571 --> 00:52:47.480
a man who beats his wife to death.
They're just,
they're both monsters.

941
00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:49.840
They're terrifying people there.
They,

942
00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:52.670
they may both as dangerous as the other ones.

943
00:52:52.671 --> 00:52:57.200
Sometimes you see like these sentences were like a man and woman committed
crime.

944
00:52:57.201 --> 00:53:00.110
The guy gets life,
the woman gets like three weeks in jail.

945
00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.930
You know why girls turn on?
The boy wasn't.

946
00:53:02.931 --> 00:53:07.220
My idea is motherfuckers crazy dragging me.
Snitches get stitches.

947
00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:08.690
Did you see this?
Um,

948
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:12.620
there's an article about this woman from a real housewives of New Jersey.

949
00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:17.200
Do you know this?
She wrote a book kind of a housewife.

950
00:53:17.201 --> 00:53:21.260
Is She on trial?
No.
Well,
there's that one too.
She basically,
uh,

951
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:26.460
says rape is okay.
What?
Yeah,
she's a,

952
00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:31.260
her Melissa Goriga supports marital rape.
In her book.

953
00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:36.420
What?
She talks,
she wrote a book about her hot marriage and,

954
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:37.200
um,

955
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:42.200
it's hilarious shit because they take all these passages and her husband is just

956
00:53:43.291 --> 00:53:45.210
a savage.
He's this,

957
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:49.860
he's this Guinea with shaved head who wears leather pants.
Okay.
Right there.

958
00:53:49.861 --> 00:53:52.810
You're,
you're,
you're,
you're in trouble.
And the leather pants or shady shit.

959
00:53:52.811 --> 00:53:56.880
You see him.
I mean,
look,
ladies,
that's a savage.
All right.

960
00:53:56.881 --> 00:54:01.670
Look at the size of that guy.
That's just how it goes.
And the,
it's,

961
00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:04.650
it's hilarious reading the book.
And I was reading it from a feminist site,

962
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:08.520
which was really particularly fascinating because they were fucking furious.

963
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:11.910
They were so mad.
You know,
he says big meathead dude.

964
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:17.270
And apparently he just bangs or like a drum and he doesn't accept no,

965
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:22.560
he called cave man.
Fucking,
yeah,
he cave man.
Fuck her,
but she looks super happy.

966
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:26.490
Yeah,
I was having the conversation.
I go to the dog park,

967
00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:31.200
I got a pit bull and there's a bunch of other comics who have pit bulls and a

968
00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:35.580
bunch of female comics came up with their pimples was dog park and all they were

969
00:54:35.581 --> 00:54:39.480
talking about was dick from the moment they got there to the moment they left,

970
00:54:39.481 --> 00:54:43.710
it was a conversation about Dick and how they're planning Dick and all this

971
00:54:43.711 --> 00:54:46.260
stuff and they were talking about this one guy.
She's like,
should I fuck them?

972
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:49.250
I'm like,
yeah,
let him just cave man.
Fuck it.

973
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:52.320
Just like knuckle drag primate.
Fuck you.

974
00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:54.390
And it's like let it happen because that's what you want.

975
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:57.900
You see these girls with these emails and he's skinny jeans and these guys

976
00:54:57.901 --> 00:55:02.250
crying like that's not it.
You need a nice cave man.
Fuck some girls,

977
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.560
some girls don't want that.
Sam Tripoli.
The point is,

978
00:55:04.561 --> 00:55:08.370
some girls do and everybody's mad at this girl because she likes it.

979
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:13.350
She likes to get grill fuck by the savage dude and people think it's horrible.

980
00:55:13.351 --> 00:55:16.080
It's terrible.
She likes to like give him to his requests.

981
00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:19.620
She likes to have dinner ready for him or he gets pissed and everybody's like,

982
00:55:19.621 --> 00:55:22.980
this guy's an asshole.
You don't have to marry him.
Okay,
she's just telling you,

983
00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:27.030
but promise.
She's giving advice and the guy writes in the book to listen.

984
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.990
Listen to this man.
I know you think your woman is it.

985
00:55:29.991 --> 00:55:32.670
The type of wants to be taken,
but trust me,
she is.

986
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:36.720
Every girl wants to get her hair pulled once in a while.
If your wife says no,

987
00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:41.610
turn around,
rip her clothes off.
She wants to be dominated.
Yo.

988
00:55:41.611 --> 00:55:44.730
Women don't realize how easy men are.
Just give us what we want.

989
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:50.010
That is hilarious.
That's really funny,

990
00:55:50.011 --> 00:55:53.580
man.
Some people are in the roleplaying.
I love that role playing.

991
00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:57.900
I love that cosplay.
I think that's awesome.
If a man comes home,

992
00:55:57.901 --> 00:56:01.500
there's no dinner on the table and his wife was on the phone watching TV or on

993
00:56:01.501 --> 00:56:03.870
the computer ignoring him,
he won't feel respected.

994
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:09.710
That's what did you expect?
It's real housewives of Jersey.
Yeah.

995
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:14.700
It's what works for them.
That's,
that's the point.
It works for them.
God Damn it.

996
00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:17.310
What's your problem?
People hate it.
Well,

997
00:56:17.311 --> 00:56:19.770
they hate it because it sends out a message to other girls.

998
00:56:19.771 --> 00:56:22.680
You know that they have to tolerate that shit and you might not want it.

999
00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:27.430
Some people do.
Yes.
Some people do.
I mean,
it's not my style.

1000
00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:30.700
I wouldn't want if I was a woman,
either eight,

1001
00:56:30.701 --> 00:56:33.820
fuck your wife ain't fuck your wife.
It's not even just a park.

1002
00:56:33.821 --> 00:56:37.290
And I think he said rape.
I by no means no unless,

1003
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:40.900
unless you're role playing.
But no means now it seems like rape to hey,

1004
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.430
it's just hilarious.
It's uh,
it's,
it's really interesting.

1005
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:48.550
There's real passionate sex and this maintenance sex,

1006
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.250
you need them both for healthy marriage.
Maintenance.

1007
00:56:51.251 --> 00:56:53.110
Sex keeps the wheels greased,

1008
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:57.220
the lines of communication open and the fights to a minimum.

1009
00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:02.480
It's basically,
it's basically controlling a zoo.
Like,
yeah,
like her,

1010
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:06.490
her,
her,
the way she handles being married is like being a zookeeper.

1011
00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.760
Occasionally.
You got to feed the monkey out and feed the animals.

1012
00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:13.150
Got to keep the,
the animals have to be treated with respect.
You know,

1013
00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:16.450
nothing wrong with that.
Hey,
if it works for you.
Yeah.

1014
00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:20.860
She fucking seems really happy.
If she's happy,
I,
you know,
it should be like,

1015
00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:24.670
this works for me.
You might want to try it.
It's really interesting man.

1016
00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:28.690
It's really interesting.
It's really interesting because uh,

1017
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:33.700
you see how other people react to this person's life and they're angry.

1018
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:37.410
You know,
it's,
it's,
it's,
I kind of,

1019
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:40.840
I think it'd be more funny than anything,
but I guess the,
a site like,

1020
00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:42.400
like these feminists science,

1021
00:57:42.401 --> 00:57:45.450
I guess their point is that the sends a really bad judge.

1022
00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:50.350
I've always felt like PR,
there's a difference between progressives and liberals.

1023
00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:54.920
<v 2>Liberals are really open minded to all all thoughts.</v>

1024
00:57:54.921 --> 00:57:56.360
I don't know if you can be open mind to everything,

1025
00:57:56.361 --> 00:57:58.160
but you pretty much open mind to different lights.

1026
00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:02.510
I feel like progressives are a little more skewed way to the left kind of way.

1027
00:58:02.511 --> 00:58:03.291
The neo cons,

1028
00:58:03.291 --> 00:58:07.430
a skewed way to the right where they have a certain vision of how the world

1029
00:58:07.431 --> 00:58:11.530
should be.
It's more of an idealistic view of the world where it's like I,

1030
00:58:11.531 --> 00:58:13.820
it's like Rosie O'donnell versus Howard Stern.

1031
00:58:13.821 --> 00:58:18.140
I feel like Howard stern and what he represents is more of a a liberal base

1032
00:58:18.141 --> 00:58:19.850
where he's like,
he'll make fun of everybody.

1033
00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:23.820
Whereas Rosie O'donnell has a certain view of how she should see the world and

1034
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:25.670
if views progressive,

1035
00:58:25.671 --> 00:58:29.810
you know like feminism and all that stuff and I'm open minded to everybody.

1036
00:58:29.811 --> 00:58:33.200
I don't care if you're straight gay or whatever you're into man,
woman,
whatever.

1037
00:58:33.201 --> 00:58:35.330
If you're a cool person,
I I'm down with it.

1038
00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:41.340
<v 3>Yeah.
I think the idea of progressive is just that.
It's just like anything else.</v>

1039
00:58:41.341 --> 00:58:45.390
Call yourself a Republican,
call yourself a Democrat,
call yourself a liberal,

1040
00:58:45.391 --> 00:58:46.530
call yourself a conservative.

1041
00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:51.800
The reality is you who you are is probably a gigantic spectrum of different

1042
00:58:54.361 --> 00:58:59.361
things and to narrow it down to one or the other and to one other people to be

1043
00:59:00.301 --> 00:59:02.670
like you is insane.
Like idealism.

1044
00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:06.270
If somebody reads this and they have a problem that this woman lives like this

1045
00:59:06.271 --> 00:59:10.830
personally,
then if she likes it,
what if she likes it?
Is that okay?

1046
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:14.640
Like I was looking at this Twitter page the other day and it was some crazy lady

1047
00:59:14.641 --> 00:59:16.800
who likes to get ball gagged and she's like,

1048
00:59:16.801 --> 00:59:19.020
there's a smile behind his ball gag and that's,
she has,

1049
00:59:19.021 --> 00:59:22.400
she's shown her rope marks on her arms and she's like in a bondage and shit like

1050
00:59:22.401 --> 00:59:23.234
that.

1051
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:28.330
But that's what she's into and isn't real feminism like allowing all the full

1052
00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:32.850
spectrum of of human behavior in,
in,
in the,

1053
00:59:32.851 --> 00:59:37.730
the female mind,
you know,
just like in the,
I mean it's a fucking,
it's ridiculous.

1054
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:41.240
This girl likes this and this keeps him happy.
It's like,
well,

1055
00:59:41.241 --> 00:59:45.110
it's like when they gave Palestine democracy and they got mad when they voted

1056
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:47.480
for who they vote for.
It's like you can't say,
hey,

1057
00:59:47.481 --> 00:59:50.630
here's the freedom to vote and then get mad who they vote for it.
You know?

1058
00:59:50.631 --> 00:59:55.370
It's like if you have freedom to choose and you choose something I like doesn't

1059
00:59:55.371 --> 00:59:57.680
mean that you didn't use it.
Right.
It's just the way it is.

1060
00:59:57.681 --> 01:00:02.270
There's also people have to acknowledge that Italians are not regular humans.

1061
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.330
They just have to,
okay.

1062
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:09.680
They have to to totally different type type of human being that Italians are

1063
01:00:09.681 --> 01:00:12.860
different than everybody else.
It's a completely different thing.

1064
01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.580
And what came from the Romans,
they there,

1065
01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:18.920
there's thousands of years of savagery behind these people.

1066
01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.990
All of a sudden they start making spaghetti and meatballs.

1067
01:00:20.991 --> 01:00:23.480
You think everything's going to calm the fuck down gray.
It's not.

1068
01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:25.650
It's not a normal person.
Right.
There's,

1069
01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:30.470
there's a big difference between the savagery that lies in the Italian DNA and

1070
01:00:30.471 --> 01:00:32.120
your average waspy type check.

1071
01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.480
You know who went to Columbia and where's Birkenstocks and he's really tired of

1072
01:00:35.481 --> 01:00:39.410
assholes like this,
promoting this kind of bullshit.
Right?
Male Petronas,

1073
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.640
the saddle,
you know,
what is that?
It's a different type of human.

1074
01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:46.760
That's what it is.
Okay.
She needs to get kb.
I look,

1075
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:52.010
there's no way you can tell me that Oprah Winfrey and Shaquille O'Neal have the

1076
01:00:52.011 --> 01:00:56.180
same thoughts.
They do not Rosie O'donnell and Shaquille O'Neal.

1077
01:00:56.181 --> 01:00:59.690
Do they have the same thoughts?
Does Michael Jordan think like Katie Couric?
No.

1078
01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:02.650
The fuck he does not.
Okay.
We're different.
Goddammit.

1079
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:06.650
And what works for you might not work for them.
Works for them.

1080
01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:08.420
Might be awesome in their world.

1081
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:12.980
I always find that people want a world that plays to their strengths and they

1082
01:01:12.981 --> 01:01:15.800
want to outlaw a place of their weaknesses.
Yes.
You know,

1083
01:01:15.801 --> 01:01:19.490
they want a world that they are their king and then it get rid of the people

1084
01:01:19.491 --> 01:01:22.310
that make me play to my weaknesses and it's just,

1085
01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:24.920
it's still obvious when you see that,
when you know,

1086
01:01:24.921 --> 01:01:27.980
ideally it should be like everybody should be allowed.

1087
01:01:27.981 --> 01:01:29.990
If you treat your fellow human being nice,

1088
01:01:29.991 --> 01:01:32.900
you should be able to be who you want to be and do what you want to do.
You know,

1089
01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:36.170
it's like the naughty shows a great example of there's some female comics who

1090
01:01:36.171 --> 01:01:39.710
will not do the naughty show cause they don't like that there's an a porn star

1091
01:01:39.711 --> 01:01:43.760
here and there.
Even though I put more females up on my show that most people,

1092
01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:47.420
I put more female comedians up on my shelf than most people do.

1093
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:50.510
I find female comics very funny.
I've the ones that I like,

1094
01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:53.150
there are some who go in there and just crush that room,

1095
01:01:53.151 --> 01:01:58.151
but there's some women who will not even get on the stage because they're just

1096
01:01:58.341 --> 01:02:01.940
think it's the,
it's degrading.
Yeah.
Degrading to women.
Yeah.

1097
01:02:01.941 --> 01:02:04.730
I understand that thinking I know where they're coming from.

1098
01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:07.290
I don't agree with it.
I think,
you know,
it's,

1099
01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.940
it's very possible to be a porn star and,
uh,

1100
01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:14.060
be a feminist if you really love sex and you really,
I mean,

1101
01:02:14.061 --> 01:02:18.320
I'm not saying that every girl who does it feels that way,
but you could be,

1102
01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:21.690
you could be someone who really loves sacs.
It really loves being like a,

1103
01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:25.880
you know,
an exhibitionist and wants to fuck on films and a brand,

1104
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:30.270
almost a man's able to do it and we don't go looking to save him.

1105
01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.930
But if a woman does it,
like,
okay,
just,
I mean this is just throwing it out there,

1106
01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:37.770
just trying to objectively look at the full spectrum of human behavior and

1107
01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:40.560
saying it is possible that it's not degrading for that woman.

1108
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.600
It is possible if it's just sex.

1109
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:46.260
I think it comes from the fact that there was a notion one time that women don't

1110
01:02:46.261 --> 01:02:47.094
like sex,

1111
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:51.900
that women only give into our sex cause we want it and they really want nothing

1112
01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:56.190
to do with it.
But the reality is they love sacks as much as men love sex.

1113
01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:00.420
And I've been reading about all these girls pulling guns out on dudes trying to

1114
01:03:00.421 --> 01:03:04.860
have sex with them to hear about the Denny's waitress who robbed the guy

1115
01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:09.390
gunpoint,
took his wallet that made him have sex with her friend.

1116
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.640
Oh God.
Gunpoint.
Yeah.
He might have had a good time that night.
I don't know,
man.

1117
01:03:14.641 --> 01:03:17.550
How ugly is that friend?
Did you need to pull a gun?
How did he get it hard?

1118
01:03:17.551 --> 01:03:19.710
And that's what's really quick.
Yeah.
That's gotta be a rough one.

1119
01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:23.100
Guy's a bad mother fucker.
Get hard with a gun in his hand.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1120
01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:24.510
I think I'm Quintin Tarantino.

1121
01:03:24.511 --> 01:03:28.990
There's a lot of people that are really emphasizing,
uh,

1122
01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.920
things that would benefit women,

1123
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.890
but there's a lot of them that do think that men should be able to be with

1124
01:03:35.891 --> 01:03:36.840
whoever the fuck they want.

1125
01:03:36.841 --> 01:03:40.170
And we should be able to choose the choose that mean there's people that you get

1126
01:03:40.171 --> 01:03:42.330
along with it.
I wouldn't,
I get along with it.
You wouldn't,

1127
01:03:42.331 --> 01:03:46.290
it's just a part of life where weird pieces and we don't fit together like

1128
01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.460
puzzles.
You know,

1129
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:52.170
sometimes you find people and together they work,
right?

1130
01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.750
It doesn't mean it seemed to make sense and yeah,
they might be broken,

1131
01:03:54.751 --> 01:03:58.290
but guess what?
You're a little broken too stupid.
You're not the perfect person.

1132
01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:02.320
You know buddies where this one article this woman was talking about,
she,

1133
01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:04.440
she posted over hate tweets.

1134
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.080
All the people that tweeted her and they were about various subjects,

1135
01:04:07.081 --> 01:04:08.900
all kinds of different things that they disagreed with her.

1136
01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.820
They should insulting her and shitting on her.
She said,
but she says,

1137
01:04:11.821 --> 01:04:16.480
you know what?
These people all have in common.
They all hate women.
It's like,
no,

1138
01:04:16.481 --> 01:04:18.900
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
They don't hate women.

1139
01:04:18.901 --> 01:04:22.530
They don't like you because people don't like you.
You can't say they hate women.

1140
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.590
That's the biggest cop out of all times.

1141
01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.360
That's trying to control the thought and stopped the conversation.

1142
01:04:27.361 --> 01:04:28.380
That's like the low blow,

1143
01:04:28.381 --> 01:04:32.910
like Oh okay conversation show you hate women think we're done.
Yeah,
exactly.

1144
01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:35.940
Exactly.
And the idea that because someone hates you,

1145
01:04:35.941 --> 01:04:40.020
they hate everything with a vagina is a ridiculous and especially when they're

1146
01:04:40.021 --> 01:04:43.110
being very specific about what you said,
that's stupid.

1147
01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:45.750
That doesn't mean they hate every woman.

1148
01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.440
And that idea that you're going to get back up from every person with a double x

1149
01:04:49.441 --> 01:04:52.090
chromosome on the planet because you said that is,

1150
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:57.120
is a silly like parachute that people pull to try to stop everything.

1151
01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:59.430
It's control your thoughts.
It's ridiculous.

1152
01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.430
It's weak and it's hacky and it's tired.

1153
01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:07.440
It's a really weak minded way of approaching any sort of a discussion.
You know,

1154
01:05:07.441 --> 01:05:07.920
you could,

1155
01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.910
you could show about how angry these fucking people are about various ideas,

1156
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.690
which is true.
The anger that you see on Twitter and on the Internet.

1157
01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:20.170
It's unbelievable.
Man.
There was,
there was a uh,
a thread today that I posted,

1158
01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.130
I posted it last night about climate change and it was just an article that I

1159
01:05:24.131 --> 01:05:28.720
read.
I think it was invite,
uh,
maybe it wasn't vice.
I'll,
I'll find out.

1160
01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:32.940
Cause I po,
I posted something advice about um,
the uh,

1161
01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:35.330
Pacific garbage patch and uh,

1162
01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:39.610
there was this thing on climate change and all I did was just put it up there

1163
01:05:39.611 --> 01:05:44.611
and the topic was nine things that or things that scientists are less sure of

1164
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:52.270
than they are of climate change and all the sudden it,
my fucking,

1165
01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:54.790
it is on vice motherboard died vice.com.

1166
01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:59.380
All of a sudden my Twitter feed became this massive argument back and forth

1167
01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:03.430
between people that are in total denial that we're causing climate change.

1168
01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:07.860
These are the same scientist in the 70s.
So we're headed to an ice age.
Um,

1169
01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:12.120
no they're not.
Those guys are dead.
Okay.
That's 1970.
You dumped con to yeah,

1170
01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:16.510
that's a long ass time ago.
You think those fucking people are alive?
1970.

1171
01:06:16.511 --> 01:06:19.790
That's 43 fucking years ago.
You think those people are still alive?
It just is.

1172
01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:24.340
People react emotionally now instead of logically they don't digest what you're

1173
01:06:24.341 --> 01:06:26.470
saying and understand that it might be a different perspective.

1174
01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:30.730
It's not even emotional.
It's ideologically,

1175
01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:35.290
there's a left and a right and people on the left think that climate change is

1176
01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:37.810
been done by man and that we're accelerating it.

1177
01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:41.110
We need to do something and carbon tax and all this shit and people on the right

1178
01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.890
think it's just a ploy to get more taxes.
People on the rights say,
look,

1179
01:06:44.891 --> 01:06:47.920
you look at the trends,
the earth is warming and cooling.

1180
01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:51.640
It's been going on forever.
It's the way things have always been.

1181
01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.840
Oh well how come the last six years of showed a coon Trent and these all these

1182
01:06:55.990 --> 01:07:00.160
wacky motherfuckers that don't want to believe it.
They're not scientists.

1183
01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.660
They have real jobs.

1184
01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:06.130
There's people that are studying this 20 hours of fucking day every day of the

1185
01:07:06.131 --> 01:07:08.620
week and they don't really know what the fuck is going on.

1186
01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:12.520
And some Dick head with a regular job and reads the Wall Street Journal and

1187
01:07:12.521 --> 01:07:16.120
pretends he's a player in the stock market cause he day trades during lunch.

1188
01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:18.880
This dump fuck thinks he can tell.
You know,

1189
01:07:19.030 --> 01:07:22.420
he's one of those Weirdo right wing.
You know,
there's,

1190
01:07:22.421 --> 01:07:26.320
this is what's good for business,
this and a lot of them are broke.

1191
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:29.770
That's what's really interesting about people that support big businesses and

1192
01:07:29.771 --> 01:07:33.190
they have right wing ideologies and a lot of them that would support these big

1193
01:07:33.191 --> 01:07:36.540
businesses are getting fucked over by the same businesses on the regular isn't

1194
01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:40.570
called the the lottery mentality where like,
yeah,
even though people are broke,

1195
01:07:40.571 --> 01:07:43.760
they're like,
I might win the lottery and then I don't want to pay taxes on that.

1196
01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:46.090
We're like,
well,
that,
that probably not going to happen.
Well,

1197
01:07:46.091 --> 01:07:49.060
there's also that people don't ever want to think that they're losers.

1198
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:51.790
They always want to thank that to just winners who haven't won yet.

1199
01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:54.580
So even if their life is shit,

1200
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:56.980
it keeps falling apart and they never get it right.

1201
01:07:57.190 --> 01:08:01.480
One day I'm gonna get it and when I do these fucking pukes in Washington,

1202
01:08:01.481 --> 01:08:05.460
I can't in a nickel,
these mother fuckers,
they don't work for Shell.
And you know,

1203
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:09.130
what they're trying to do is to put the hippies to vote against your own

1204
01:08:09.131 --> 01:08:13.180
interests.
It's just so interesting.
Yeah.
This guy,
Seth Bronstein,

1205
01:08:13.181 --> 01:08:15.530
the Associated Press and science correspondent.

1206
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:20.150
What he said was that the world's climatologists are now gearing up for

1207
01:08:20.151 --> 01:08:25.070
officially to officially put claim that they are 95% certain that humans are to

1208
01:08:25.071 --> 01:08:29.120
blame for global warning.
That 5% gap may seen large.

1209
01:08:29.121 --> 01:08:32.180
It is not in science,
nothing is 100% sure.

1210
01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:36.620
Not even a law of gravity and according to this Guy Borenstein there are a few

1211
01:08:36.621 --> 01:08:41.480
things that scientists or just as or less certain of then climate change and

1212
01:08:41.481 --> 01:08:46.481
they are one that cigarettes kill to the age of the universe.

1213
01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:51.820
Three that vitamins make you healthy and for that dioxin in Super Fund sites is

1214
01:08:52.881 --> 01:08:56.960
dangerous.
Wow,
that's la.
That's hilarious.

1215
01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:02.560
Also that string theory actually describes reality and that the rate of the

1216
01:09:02.601 --> 01:09:05.120
universe expanded after the Big Bang.
Those are,
uh,

1217
01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:08.690
those are other ones that the author has added a little less certain about this

1218
01:09:08.691 --> 01:09:11.960
author Brian Merchant.
So interesting article and it's,

1219
01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:14.450
it's a big point is that for whatever reason,

1220
01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:17.840
people that don't really know want to jump up and say,
look,

1221
01:09:17.841 --> 01:09:20.930
I am no fucking climate expert by any stretch of the imagination.
I,

1222
01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.230
I sort of get it,
but I also,
I know that there was,

1223
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.350
I mean there's been ice ages without human intervention.

1224
01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:29.610
There's been the period when the dinosaurs were here.

1225
01:09:29.611 --> 01:09:32.060
It was a vastly different climate than we are experiencing right now.

1226
01:09:32.061 --> 01:09:33.680
We obviously had nothing to do with that.

1227
01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:36.050
That was an asteroid impact that changed our climate.

1228
01:09:36.230 --> 01:09:39.530
All that shit happens and it happens on a regular basis and it probably happened

1229
01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:42.800
12,000 years ago and it's probably what ended the last ice age.

1230
01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:48.400
But these people that pretend that they know that we're not causing some of it,

1231
01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.060
you're crazy.

1232
01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:54.080
Is it that you think that you could now get your news tailored to your views

1233
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.860
instead of like everybody watching like four channels now?

1234
01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:02.861
There's such niche news channels that just play to what you want to hear so just

1235
01:10:03.831 --> 01:10:05.570
reinforces what you're saying.

1236
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:08.780
Like there's no real f you don't hear the other side of the argument.

1237
01:10:08.781 --> 01:10:12.230
You only hear what you want to hear.
Well there's certainly that,

1238
01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:15.670
that's certainly an option.
At least it is right now.
You know,

1239
01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.730
I think one of these days there's going to be some sort of technology where you

1240
01:10:19.731 --> 01:10:23.500
could post something and it will immediately be bare verified as truth or,

1241
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:27.590
or horse shit.
Like say if you,
Oh,
I'd love to see the horse shit symbol.

1242
01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:29.570
Well it's,
it seems like it should be able to,

1243
01:10:29.571 --> 01:10:34.571
like you should be able to post a statement and then have to put like an ass or

1244
01:10:36.351 --> 01:10:39.180
an I said it's just an idea.
Uh,

1245
01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:43.340
you know f maybe it's just that it's fiction or s a statement if you want people

1246
01:10:43.341 --> 01:10:47.870
to take you seriously.
So if you go with s and you believe this and then boom,

1247
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:52.760
it calculates all of the known scientific data from peer reviewed sources and it

1248
01:10:52.761 --> 01:10:57.560
just gives you a pile of horse shit that sits underneath your post.

1249
01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.940
Oh,
this should be a graphic.
This,
this post has been shown to be horse shit.

1250
01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:04.610
And then is something that like would be really interesting.

1251
01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.100
Like it would stop a lot of like Internet debate,

1252
01:11:07.101 --> 01:11:10.400
like climate debate or this debate of that.
There's a lot of it.

1253
01:11:10.401 --> 01:11:13.260
You've got to Google Shit and you gotta find the post the posted up.
No,

1254
01:11:13.261 --> 01:11:14.280
that's bio source.

1255
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.210
<v 1>And it'd be nice if there was a,
and it will,
it will happen.
It's gonna happen.</v>

1256
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:22.590
Consumer reports,
no bias,
just boom,
no advertisements,
no nothing.

1257
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:23.281
Peak in a,

1258
01:11:23.281 --> 01:11:28.281
which people on Twitter today were schooling me on Yelp,

1259
01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:30.990
some business orange because I love Yelp.

1260
01:11:30.991 --> 01:11:33.990
Yelp is such a great resource when you go somewhere,

1261
01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.880
like if you go like to a town,

1262
01:11:35.881 --> 01:11:37.830
you want to find out what the bad ass restaurant is.

1263
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:39.930
For the most part it's super accurate.

1264
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:45.180
But apparently two things that people,
uh,
showed me,
one,

1265
01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:50.310
which is kind of crazy,
is that Yelp actually writes reviews.

1266
01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:55.020
Like they have employees that even write bad reviews.
What?
Yes.

1267
01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:58.950
And that if you have some shitty reviews on your site,

1268
01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:03.930
they'll actually ask you if you want to get those moved and they can like move

1269
01:12:03.931 --> 01:12:08.430
them to the back price.
Yeah,
they charge you,
they charge you per month.

1270
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.430
And it's a,

1271
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:15.470
like these people were describing like being called like once a month by the

1272
01:12:15.511 --> 01:12:17.400
company.
And you know,
I mean,

1273
01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:21.390
I obviously this is one side of it and I would love to hear the ledge,

1274
01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.760
the Yelp site as well because like I said,

1275
01:12:23.761 --> 01:12:27.030
I use Yelp all the time and I really like it.

1276
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:32.010
But it said there was another thing that 20% of all Yelp reviews are written by

1277
01:12:32.011 --> 01:12:34.440
page.
Shills.
Oh,
I mean,

1278
01:12:34.441 --> 01:12:38.010
you can see that on like iTunes comments and I mean like you can just,

1279
01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.620
there's computer programs who just like,

1280
01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:45.660
we'll make up fake like comments.
Well,
you know what else they're doing.

1281
01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:49.230
There's also people that are manipulating their iTunes a number,

1282
01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:53.770
especially podcast by re uploading the same episode by,
uh,

1283
01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:57.360
by they,
they,
there's some way that they manipulate the upload process.

1284
01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.870
I had a f uh,
Chris score was on my podcast and he was telling me about,

1285
01:13:00.871 --> 01:13:01.980
he knew he wouldn't name the names,

1286
01:13:01.981 --> 01:13:06.270
but he knows people who know how to manipulate it just so their rankings can go

1287
01:13:06.271 --> 01:13:08.370
up.
Yeah.
Well,
that's how you're ranking on no clue.

1288
01:13:08.371 --> 01:13:13.350
I just rankings go up by apparently the iTunes thing has to do with posts and

1289
01:13:13.351 --> 01:13:17.820
comments and it also has to do with downloads and also stay with new
subscribers.

1290
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.590
And so people develop algorithms to kind of hack into this.
Allegedly,

1291
01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.410
allegedly this is alleged,
by the way,
this is not my thoughts,

1292
01:13:25.411 --> 01:13:28.620
this is according to another podcast or really was upset about it,

1293
01:13:28.621 --> 01:13:32.110
but he thinks that there's some shenanigans going on.
I'm sure there is.
Well,

1294
01:13:32.111 --> 01:13:35.070
did you hear about that guy that uh,
he was buying,
um,

1295
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:38.100
buying Twitter friends,
you,
there's,

1296
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:42.750
there's a service and as a comedian he admitted to buying Twitter friends.

1297
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:47.400
And then last night he actually punched um,
a reviewer.

1298
01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.110
He was at a show.
Did you hear about this?

1299
01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:54.660
And I mean it really kind of fucking mild shit that this guy got stories about

1300
01:13:54.661 --> 01:13:59.000
that dude.
The guy punched him.
Oh yeah.
What's his name?
Uh,
whatever.

1301
01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:01.080
You don't need to,
I don't want to get sued,

1302
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:04.260
but I wa I was actually on tour and they were telling me a story about punches.

1303
01:14:04.261 --> 01:14:08.080
You will sue you if story about him that uh,

1304
01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:11.980
he was famous then if they sue,
I'm not gonna tell store.
No he doesn't.
You

1305
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.780
<v 2>don't have to this,
he didn't say who the guy is.</v>

1306
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.270
Well what he you would do is like if he,
if he,

1307
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:20.050
if you found out you were the same kind of comedian as him,
an ethnic group,

1308
01:14:20.051 --> 01:14:20.530
right.

1309
01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:25.150
He found it use the same time a comedian has and you got booked on this ethnic

1310
01:14:25.151 --> 01:14:26.530
group comedy night.

1311
01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.800
What do you would find out is he would call you up and he'd go,
Hey,

1312
01:14:29.801 --> 01:14:34.150
I got this other Gig that night.
It pays this.
Why aren't you do my show?

1313
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:38.770
And you'd be like,
why are we got booked bum?
I are few more mind guys.
Okay,

1314
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:43.810
so you on book that show,
he'll call them up,
get you booked on,

1315
01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:48.550
book himself in your spot.
And then when the show comes up I'll call you.
I'm go,

1316
01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:52.810
yeah,
the show got canceled.
I'm sorry.
And then go do your spot in your show.

1317
01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:58.200
Unless you've heard this firsthand.
I wouldn't say that cause that's I,

1318
01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:02.080
you just,
I just told me,
I just said it again.
Can we kill him?
Yeah.

1319
01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:07.080
I would never say no.
Yeah,
that shit come on and it goes live.
Go wide.

1320
01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:09.350
And that's how I've heard the story.
So he punched

1321
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:13.400
<v 3>guy in the face.
This guy who was a,
um,
uh,</v>

1322
01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:17.480
I guess he's a a reviewer for,
what does he review for it?

1323
01:15:17.481 --> 01:15:19.790
Not the Huffington Post.
It was a,
I'll tell you right now.

1324
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:24.850
He reviews for a Newsweek daily beast and hilarious.

1325
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:30.770
That mean it's hilarious.
The Guy was,
uh,
you know,

1326
01:15:30.771 --> 01:15:34.970
he's telling a bunch of hacky jokes and so the dude talked about it on his

1327
01:15:34.971 --> 01:15:36.770
Twitter and he came up to him,

1328
01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:40.640
asked him if that was his name and just punches him right in the face and then

1329
01:15:40.641 --> 01:15:42.980
pushed him and then came back and punched him in the face again.

1330
01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:46.820
And what the guy said was really fucking mild.

1331
01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:49.790
This is what gets you to punch his,

1332
01:15:49.890 --> 01:15:53.810
the guy's name was funny until he dusted off as 2005,

1333
01:15:53.811 --> 01:15:57.200
Katrina jokes in a gratingly bad GWB impression.

1334
01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:02.330
That sounds like some,
some criticism that started off saying you were funny,

1335
01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:03.411
you're funny,

1336
01:16:03.411 --> 01:16:07.250
and then you did a shitty joke or you're funny until you started telling jokes.

1337
01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.200
And then he said he makes the umpteenth,

1338
01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:13.280
his umpteenth joke about how agents can't distinguish between letters l and r

1339
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:15.800
election erection.
We get it.
That's it.

1340
01:16:15.801 --> 01:16:20.240
And then the next one is the guy just punched him in the face.
That's incredible.

1341
01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:23.180
The guy's name is Josh Rogan.
I N and no,

1342
01:16:23.181 --> 01:16:24.950
I'm not talking about this because his name is Rogan.

1343
01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:28.430
I'm talking about this because it's important you shouldn't get punched because

1344
01:16:28.431 --> 01:16:31.610
you say someone's socks.
Who by listening to Josh Rogan's tweets,

1345
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:35.840
pretty much fucking socks.
And if the guy's not telling the truth,
I mean,
if he's,

1346
01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:39.920
you know,
if he made up these guys,
I mean,
this guy's tweets,

1347
01:16:39.921 --> 01:16:42.530
it would be one thing,
but we could read them,
you know,

1348
01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:45.740
we could read them and we could see exactly what he said that got him punched.

1349
01:16:45.741 --> 01:16:50.110
And it's pretty Goddamn mile.
Pretty Tame.
I mean,
there's,
you know,
there's

1350
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:52.960
<v 2>no hiding this.
It's not like he called me a coke and he says,</v>

1351
01:16:52.961 --> 01:16:56.260
my mother's a whore.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It says right there.

1352
01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.390
So if that's really how it went down,
we don't know how it went.

1353
01:16:59.391 --> 01:17:03.340
If I swung on everybody that criticize me on Twitter,

1354
01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:07.570
it'd be just one.
I'd be Bruce Lee taken.
I'm 90 dudes at one time we saw,

1355
01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:10.130
I was talking about with the climate thing is how God damn

1356
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.900
<v 3>angry people get on Twitter.</v>

1357
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:15.830
People were so angry and I don't think it's because of the words that they're

1358
01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:16.370
debating.

1359
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:21.320
I think most of this anger is there are already on a short fuse because they're

1360
01:17:21.321 --> 01:17:23.990
not happy with their situation,

1361
01:17:23.991 --> 01:17:28.970
whether it's their relationship or their body or their job or their career or

1362
01:17:28.971 --> 01:17:31.920
all of the above.
There's whether it's,
you know,

1363
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:35.690
whether there's something they did wrong or whether there's something they

1364
01:17:35.691 --> 01:17:37.490
haven't done right,
whatever it is.

1365
01:17:37.491 --> 01:17:40.970
I think people just inherently frustrated their position in life and there's a,

1366
01:17:40.971 --> 01:17:43.730
you know,
there's,
everyone is anonymous,

1367
01:17:43.731 --> 01:17:47.570
so it's like there's very little accountability.
It doesn't come back to you.

1368
01:17:47.571 --> 01:17:50.060
It only goes back to your page and it stops there.

1369
01:17:50.061 --> 01:17:54.320
That's why what a ESPN has done is now you have to log in with your Facebook

1370
01:17:54.321 --> 01:17:57.260
page because Facebook,
you have to use your real name.

1371
01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:00.140
They have to verify it's you,
and you have to use your real name.

1372
01:18:00.141 --> 01:18:02.990
So if you're going to comment somewhere,
you have to put your name on it.
Oh,

1373
01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:06.740
that's funny.
But ESPN makes you do that.
That sounds like bullshit to me.

1374
01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:11.080
I don't like that.
I do and I don't.
I like accountability,
you know?
Yeah.

1375
01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:13.940
But I don't think it takes away a lot of trolling.

1376
01:18:13.941 --> 01:18:16.970
If you're going to say something,
you're going to put your name on it.
Yeah.

1377
01:18:16.971 --> 01:18:21.710
And I guess it does.
If your rep,
if you're representing a company like ESPN,

1378
01:18:21.711 --> 01:18:26.270
they do have a very,
uh,
certain,
um,
reputation to uphold.
They got mad at me once.

1379
01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:31.700
Who?
ESPN.
Yeah.
I,
I said that,
uh,
I said that this dude,

1380
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:34.520
Houston Alexander fights,
like he tried to rape his mother.

1381
01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:40.430
I'm sorry I said that,
but that's an old school gym expression.
Unfortunately,

1382
01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:43.670
as a a person who's trained in fight,
Jim's my whole life.

1383
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:47.750
That's a a really common expression.
It doesn't seem like it is,

1384
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:52.070
but it actually is.
It's,
especially in the east coast where I grew up in Boston.

1385
01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:56.270
That is,
I have heard that so many times in the,
in the description of a guy,
dude,

1386
01:18:56.271 --> 01:19:00.020
it's,
it's Disney man.
They,
they,
they uh,

1387
01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:05.080
suspended Tony Kornheiser because he said that one of the female reporters was

1388
01:19:05.481 --> 01:19:09.890
dressing like,
she's like 20 years younger and they,
he had to take a week off.

1389
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:13.640
I mean it's because ESPN has had a lot of pro,
if you read their book,

1390
01:19:13.641 --> 01:19:16.760
they had a lot of problem with sexual harassment way back in the day.

1391
01:19:16.761 --> 01:19:19.910
So anything that comes even close to that,
it's like,
whoa.

1392
01:19:19.930 --> 01:19:21.890
It's just unfortunate when everybody has to,
I mean,

1393
01:19:21.891 --> 01:19:24.650
it's one thing if you're saying something that's shitty and,

1394
01:19:24.810 --> 01:19:28.400
but it's another thing to act like straight forward towards political

1395
01:19:28.401 --> 01:19:31.490
correctness because if I said he fights,
like he's trying,

1396
01:19:31.710 --> 01:19:34.610
he tried to kill his mother.
Everyone would have been fine with that.

1397
01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:36.740
You fight like he fights,
like he tried to kill his mother.

1398
01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:38.330
Everybody would have been fine like that,

1399
01:19:38.331 --> 01:19:43.310
but the sexual implications of rape or somehow or another off,
it's just too,

1400
01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.680
it's too much.
It's officer violence and sex.

1401
01:19:45.681 --> 01:19:48.600
I just looked at two totally different things.
Isn't it weird?

1402
01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:52.400
It is a movie and you see a dude kill 30 40 people.

1403
01:19:52.401 --> 01:19:55.730
But if they fuck and you see his penis going into her vagina,

1404
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:59.510
people will explode.
The thing that they want to do all day.

1405
01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:04.160
Everybody wants a fuck.
This is what most people want.
If your hormones work,

1406
01:20:04.190 --> 01:20:04.881
you want this.

1407
01:20:04.881 --> 01:20:09.270
You want someone who wants to fuck you and the you want to fuck them and you

1408
01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:12.210
actually liked them and they actually like you and you,
you,

1409
01:20:12.211 --> 01:20:14.910
you guys both liked to fuck each other and you'd go at it.

1410
01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:18.780
That's what people want.
What do people not want to get killed?

1411
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:21.420
They don't want to get killed,
but what can't you see?

1412
01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:25.620
Can't see people fucking what?
Can you see people getting guilt?
Why is that?

1413
01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:29.820
We're crazy.
We didn't,
we never hear about stories about Spri sexist,

1414
01:20:29.821 --> 01:20:33.480
peop people walking into the offices and just fucking having sex with everybody.

1415
01:20:33.481 --> 01:20:34.460
You never see that.
And I knew it was,

1416
01:20:34.461 --> 01:20:36.750
but you see a guy going crazy and shooting everybody.
Yeah.

1417
01:20:36.751 --> 01:20:39.720
Nobody goes to the neighbor,
the Navy Yard and sucks.
Everybody's fair.

1418
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:44.460
Some chick like crazy,
crazy.
One of the tech socking rampage,
you know,

1419
01:20:44.461 --> 01:20:48.890
that is a really important point.
We have this weird desire for,

1420
01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:53.980
for violence in this country and even though in real life we love sax and we

1421
01:20:54.121 --> 01:20:58.500
want sex all the time.
You can't just blow people on TV.
He can't.
I mean,

1422
01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:01.530
if they,
if they show anything in the,
in the TV show,

1423
01:21:01.531 --> 01:21:03.760
it's a kiss and maybe you start pulling,

1424
01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:07.480
show his clothes off and then the fucking screen was black sex and the city

1425
01:21:07.481 --> 01:21:11.370
stuff.
It's like passion,
passion.
Next day,
laying in bed.

1426
01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:16.470
Could you imagine if there was a real incident where a guy came to like some

1427
01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:20.580
police station and just sucked everybody's Dick just gas the whole room,

1428
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:24.900
pulls a pin,
throws it in their sleep and gas.
Everybody falls asleep.

1429
01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:28.530
They wake up and the video tapes of him just show him suck in every dick in the

1430
01:21:28.531 --> 01:21:31.050
place because he goes and he's there were unconscious.

1431
01:21:31.051 --> 01:21:34.170
These members have families and you just suck on her Cox.

1432
01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:39.720
He gives them all Viagra.
Ainley puts it in their ass,
crushes it up.
Crunch,

1433
01:21:39.721 --> 01:21:42.930
crunch,
crunch the Russian chick.
Yeah.
Who Law.

1434
01:21:43.050 --> 01:21:46.080
The guy walked into the the beauty salon and he goes,

1435
01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:51.160
fucker fucking who has that much telephone wire available to tie somebody up and

1436
01:21:52.381 --> 01:21:55.770
then just shelled Viagara in it for three days.
It's attitude to let her,

1437
01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:59.760
he's full of Shit.
It's nonsense.
He's full of Shit.

1438
01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:03.300
He fucked her.
Look.
I even,

1439
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:06.280
I just think even if someone gave you Viagara,
if he didn't want to fuck them,

1440
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:07.350
you probably wouldn't get hard.

1441
01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:11.700
It's the Viagra doesn't make you just get hard for no reason.
Just eat a Viagara.

1442
01:22:11.701 --> 01:22:16.080
Your Dick doesn't just get hard.
You have to get stimulated.
I don't know,
man.

1443
01:22:16.081 --> 01:22:18.540
I think where direction,
I think he's annoying.

1444
01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:20.880
He's probably just a dumb dude that wanted attention.

1445
01:22:20.881 --> 01:22:24.620
She make me six live as the worst Russian accent ever.
Fairly.

1446
01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:28.620
There you got a future in voiceovers?
I don't think I do believe in yourself.

1447
01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:33.550
I don't,
I don't,
did you see that dude where they grew a nose on his face?
Yeah.

1448
01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:37.170
And that's the bad car accident.
He's got an host on his forehead.

1449
01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:42.320
Well he had a car accident and then he got a nose infection and then the middle

1450
01:22:42.931 --> 01:22:47.370
of this infection,
um,
his nose actually like,
you know,
like you,

1451
01:22:47.371 --> 01:22:49.290
you can get a necrosis,

1452
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:54.330
you can get like a really bad skin infection and your tissue dies off and they

1453
01:22:54.331 --> 01:22:58.020
have to replace that tissue.
Like sometimes with a staph infections,

1454
01:22:58.021 --> 01:23:02.970
guys have to get,
um,
there's,
the dude knows,
right?
Yeah.
That's the growing,

1455
01:23:03.330 --> 01:23:06.130
well,
you know,
that woman who was on a time cover with her nose

1456
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:09.220
<v 2>cutoff,
do you remember that?
There's a time,</v>

1457
01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:13.480
whatever it was a famous case of violence against women in Afghanistan.

1458
01:23:13.481 --> 01:23:16.720
She was given away.
It's sanely horrible.

1459
01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:21.090
She was given away as like,
as property is.
Like,
you know,
she,
they,

1460
01:23:21.091 --> 01:23:25.780
the parents owed money or something and they gave her away.
Oh my God.
You know,

1461
01:23:25.781 --> 01:23:27.250
having little girls,
man.

1462
01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:31.600
And the idea of that about giving your little girl way to someone who is so

1463
01:23:31.601 --> 01:23:36.190
horrific to me.
So impossible to even imagine.

1464
01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:41.110
I've been Afghanistan,
they are half ass backwards.
I'm sorry man.

1465
01:23:41.111 --> 01:23:44.260
Is Medieval Times over there?
How many times you go there?

1466
01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:46.180
I went there once and we uh,

1467
01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:49.930
we were actually there when the big prison break happened that kind of changed

1468
01:23:49.931 --> 01:23:51.400
the momentum of the board.
They,

1469
01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:56.080
they had this big inside job worth 300 extremists got out and it kind of changed

1470
01:23:56.081 --> 01:23:59.620
it and we couldn't leave right off the bat because of the whole thing.

1471
01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:04.360
But it happened while you were there.
Whoa.
Would that feel like it was scary,

1472
01:24:04.361 --> 01:24:08.200
man?
I mean it was scary things,
but you know,
it's like if I do usls man,

1473
01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:11.890
I would prefer to go into a war zone and irritating the troops.
I just,

1474
01:24:12.370 --> 01:24:14.920
they're very appreciative and you feel like you're doing something for him.

1475
01:24:14.921 --> 01:24:16.990
So I'd rather go into that then go,

1476
01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:20.710
I've done basis on like Guam where it just,
there's no,

1477
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:22.600
and I'm glad there's no war going on there,

1478
01:24:22.601 --> 01:24:25.750
but it's just like they're just a base.
And they're okay with it.

1479
01:24:25.751 --> 01:24:28.420
But they're like,
yeah,
whatever.
You know,
but you go into some queue.

1480
01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:33.540
We went to a base called the Alamo cause it was so rounded by locals man.

1481
01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:39.130
And they were so thankful.
I mean they were totally a pre,

1482
01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.840
every joke just was this giant def jam laugh.
Why?
Boom,
boom,
boom.

1483
01:24:43.841 --> 01:24:47.320
Just huge laughter man.
I would much rather do that.
Wow.

1484
01:24:47.321 --> 01:24:49.960
That's really interesting.
Do you still do it?
You still go over this?
Did one,

1485
01:24:49.961 --> 01:24:52.260
we went to Bahrain.
Uh,

1486
01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.560
we're like all the missiles are in case I ran,
decides to,
you know,

1487
01:24:56.590 --> 01:25:01.570
get a little crazy.
Well that's the,
uh,
that's the place where Amber Lyon,
uh,

1488
01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.800
got fired from CNN or left CNN because of she uh,

1489
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:09.580
did this detailed report on Bahrain and they turned it into like a tourist
piece.

1490
01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:14.200
Like you should visit Bob Rain,
beautiful downtown Bar rain.

1491
01:25:14.230 --> 01:25:16.240
It's weird when you go to all these places,

1492
01:25:16.241 --> 01:25:19.420
how much American culture is everywhere.
You know,

1493
01:25:19.421 --> 01:25:23.290
Aaron Cater use have a joke about that.
About how,
um,
you know,

1494
01:25:23.291 --> 01:25:25.330
like he goes in the Middle East,
do entertaining,

1495
01:25:25.331 --> 01:25:28.390
maybe like America is a paper tiger,
you know,
but what do you want?

1496
01:25:28.391 --> 01:25:32.170
Do you want KFC,
Yolanda?
Tgi Fridays.
And it's true.
You go there.

1497
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:36.060
All of our stuff is everywhere.
Yeah.
Those big corporations,
it's like,
oh,

1498
01:25:36.090 --> 01:25:39.550
subway's a little Caesar's.
I mean,
who the fuck?

1499
01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:44.380
Where's the little fucking Caesar's?
It's in Bahrain,
dude.
Do you know that,

1500
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:49.470
um,
subway is the biggest chain in the world now.

1501
01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:53.860
Bigger than Mcdonald's surpassed it.
Yup.
And then credible.
Yeah,
man.

1502
01:25:53.890 --> 01:25:57.790
I mean people like that fake meat,
Bro.
Is it fake?
Oh yeah.
I mean,

1503
01:25:57.791 --> 01:26:02.290
well alleged.
I know.
It's real me.
Get out of here.
I mean,
you could eat it,

1504
01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:06.710
but it's me.
What's here?
It's processed.
Of course it's processed.
Yeah.
Well,

1505
01:26:06.711 --> 01:26:09.200
if you want it preserved,
I love subway,
by the way.

1506
01:26:09.201 --> 01:26:12.560
I don't want this to be like an anti subway thing.
I eat that thing all day.

1507
01:26:12.561 --> 01:26:17.060
Buffalo chicken till I die.
I was in,
um,
Cheech and Eatsa,
uh,

1508
01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:17.953
go into the,

1509
01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:22.640
to see the Mayan Pyramids and we pass by this huge sign for Coca Cola,

1510
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.310
a big billboard and the jungle for Coca Cola.
I was like,
this is so weird,
right?

1511
01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:31.550
Coca Cola in the middle of the jungle.
It's really strange.

1512
01:26:31.551 --> 01:26:35.780
So there's a whole thing that Mcdonald's had expanded as far as it could expand

1513
01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:39.020
that,
you know,
like these,
these fast food chains,

1514
01:26:39.021 --> 01:26:43.280
they make as much money on selling franchises as they do on selling burgers.

1515
01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:44.910
And the one thing was that they,

1516
01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:48.920
they had expanded everywhere they can and can't expand anywhere else.
Yeah.

1517
01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:51.800
There probably was no more spots where they could be and was viable.

1518
01:26:51.801 --> 01:26:55.570
But subway had a new niche.
People wanted to get thin like Jared.
Yep.

1519
01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:59.570
I just weird cause like in La,
like they,
they open,
they,

1520
01:26:59.571 --> 01:27:03.450
it's either chases triple A's or Starbucks there though.

1521
01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:06.740
Someday they'll open the Chipola in a chase bank that's in a Starbucks.

1522
01:27:06.741 --> 01:27:09.680
There's so many.
But the minute I leave la and I go somewhere,
I'm like,

1523
01:27:09.681 --> 01:27:12.220
where the Starbucks?
You told me that um,

1524
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:17.290
when you were in Afghanistan they have Manlove Thursday man love Thursdays days

1525
01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:20.390
that real?
Yes.
They,
you saw it.

1526
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:23.890
Well I didn't watch guys go but fuck in the mountains.
I didn't.

1527
01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:27.470
Let's say people told you,
man,
that shit.
Did people tell you about it?

1528
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:32.510
I ask anybody who was on tour in who was on duty in Afghanistan,

1529
01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:35.270
ask them about man love Thursday.
They'd be like,
hey,

1530
01:27:35.271 --> 01:27:38.690
how'd you know about that is the only Thursdays though that gets Thursdays puff

1531
01:27:38.691 --> 01:27:42.410
fucking Thursdays.
So what does it mean Thursday everyone's allowed to be gay.
No,

1532
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:44.060
it's,
they don't see it as gay.

1533
01:27:44.061 --> 01:27:49.061
They see it as like they see women are for procreation men or for fun.

1534
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:53.960
Is that really true?
According to what I was told over there.

1535
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:57.260
And you can go into the mountains and they just,

1536
01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:00.650
and they bought fuck each other and they're dirty too.
I mean just,

1537
01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:05.390
just the idea of thought.
Fuck.
It was a harsh,
dirty dude.
I mean like there dude.

1538
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:06.500
I mean,
they tried to build,

1539
01:28:06.501 --> 01:28:11.501
like they tried to build these things for the pedestrians to walk up over the,

1540
01:28:11.730 --> 01:28:13.280
the road,
like a walkover.

1541
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:15.470
They would just go in there and take dumps and then leave.

1542
01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:18.710
They didn't even use it to as a walkover like they do in Vegas.

1543
01:28:18.711 --> 01:28:21.140
You know when you're walking in Las Vegas Boulevard,

1544
01:28:21.141 --> 01:28:24.330
they have those pedestrian walkovers.
There's an article about it online.

1545
01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.590
It says Afghanistan's male soldiers are having sex with other guys,

1546
01:28:27.591 --> 01:28:31.940
but don't call them homos.
Well,
there was also something where like,
uh,

1547
01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:35.210
they were like their soldiers,

1548
01:28:35.211 --> 01:28:38.410
they would have a young boy who would have to service everybody,
check this.

1549
01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.860
And they had to tell the soldiers,
don't get upset about that.
But yeah,

1550
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:47.290
don't get involved.
That's their custom.
Whoa.
Well,

1551
01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:49.970
we know their customers,
that the young girl that died,

1552
01:28:49.971 --> 01:28:52.670
she was sold away to marriage.
She was eight years old.

1553
01:28:52.671 --> 01:28:56.330
She died after having sex with a guy.
This,
listen to this.

1554
01:28:56.390 --> 01:29:00.950
Afghanistan's w w the,
the article is in Queerty,
um,

1555
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:02.460
free of an agenda

1556
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:07.110
<v 1>except that gay one,
Queer D.
Dot com queer.
Like instead of Cordy.</v>

1557
01:29:07.111 --> 01:29:12.090
Queerty how Ha Alex have were they,
when they got that domain nanny as I love,

1558
01:29:12.091 --> 01:29:16.500
I love the title to freaking agenda.
Yeah,
go ahead.
Um,

1559
01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:21.210
and it's talking about a,
it says Afghanistan's mail.
Sir soldiers have a sex,

1560
01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:23.660
have sex with other guys,
but don't call them homos.

1561
01:29:23.670 --> 01:29:25.470
And it says it's really interesting.

1562
01:29:25.471 --> 01:29:27.930
It says America's gay soldiers have unique struggle in their hands,

1563
01:29:28.050 --> 01:29:31.050
whether the hide or be open about their sexuality.

1564
01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.710
But Afghanistan's gay soldiers have a different battle.

1565
01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:39.090
Despite regularly having sex with other men and shunning women.

1566
01:29:39.450 --> 01:29:43.800
Many of these male soldiers refused to identify as gay,

1567
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:47.430
which can get in the way of say,
preventing STDs.

1568
01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:52.940
You need only watched the CNN clip below where three gay American troops speak

1569
01:29:53.341 --> 01:29:56.970
of the need to repeal.
Don't ask,
don't tell,
has been repealed.

1570
01:29:56.970 --> 01:30:00.000
Now I believe to understand the difficulties of being gained.

1571
01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:04.540
The US armed forces,
you know,
oldest article is from man love.

1572
01:30:04.541 --> 01:30:08.790
Thursdays has its own post on urban dictionary.
It's the article.

1573
01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:10.290
It doesn't say where it's from here.

1574
01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:14.160
Unfortunately it doesn't say what year.

1575
01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:19.060
So it was before.
Don't ask,
don't tell was repelled.
So I don't,
hmm.

1576
01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:22.800
Repealed rather,
um,
for these Afghan soldiers.
However,

1577
01:30:22.801 --> 01:30:25.500
having sex regularly with other men is no big deal.

1578
01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:29.580
Just don't call them gay and unclassified study from military research unit in

1579
01:30:29.581 --> 01:30:32.700
southern Afghanistan.
That's a funny statement.

1580
01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:37.050
And unclassified study from a military research unit in southern Afghanistan

1581
01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:40.800
that's looking into gay sex details,

1582
01:30:40.801 --> 01:30:45.060
how homosexual behavior is unusually common amongst men,

1583
01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:50.120
among men in the large ethnic group known as Pash Dunes,

1584
01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:53.340
PA ash t you ends Pashtuns,

1585
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:57.570
although they seem to be in complete denial about it.

1586
01:30:58.350 --> 01:31:01.590
What's a new unclassified study of past June meant Oh,
that's,

1587
01:31:01.710 --> 01:31:05.970
that's what the new,
uh,
unclassified study revealed these men admire.

1588
01:31:05.970 --> 01:31:10.970
Other men physically have sexual relationships with boys and shun women both

1589
01:31:11.191 --> 01:31:16.170
socially and sexually.
Yet they completely reject the label of homosexual.

1590
01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:21.330
The research was conducted as part of a long standing effort to better

1591
01:31:21.331 --> 01:31:25.650
understand Afghan culture and improve western interaction with the local people.

1592
01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:28.730
When you reach it like that and you read that,
you're like,

1593
01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.320
people are dying over there,
you know,
and you,

1594
01:31:31.321 --> 01:31:33.480
you think like the idea that they're going to try to change this.

1595
01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:36.450
You think about what they do with a marry off eight year old girls cut women's

1596
01:31:36.451 --> 01:31:40.080
noses off.
They,
they do this kind of shit.
Pretend they're not gay,

1597
01:31:40.081 --> 01:31:43.440
whether fucking each other and be homophobic at the same time.

1598
01:31:43.441 --> 01:31:46.410
It's absolute madness.

1599
01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:50.580
It's reality your way right away.
It's like custom made reality.

1600
01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:53.970
This is what they do.
This is how they figured out their way around it.

1601
01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:59.360
The pash doing men interpret the Islamic prohibition on homosexuality to mean

1602
01:32:00.101 --> 01:32:02.530
they cannot love another man,

1603
01:32:02.890 --> 01:32:06.580
but it doesn't mean they can't use men for sexual gratification.

1604
01:32:06.610 --> 01:32:08.830
What an interesting little gray area there.

1605
01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:11.470
There's a little fine print right there.

1606
01:32:11.530 --> 01:32:13.300
It's sort of like prostitution is illegal,

1607
01:32:13.301 --> 01:32:18.301
but if a girl is naked at a strip club and she rides your Dick and you come your

1608
01:32:18.431 --> 01:32:22.360
pants,
that's all good.
If,
if it prostitution's illegal,

1609
01:32:22.361 --> 01:32:25.720
but if I buy you dinner and then we have sex,

1610
01:32:25.721 --> 01:32:29.740
I spend the same amount of money on the date and then I have sex with you.

1611
01:32:29.741 --> 01:32:31.990
It's perfectly legal or paver,

1612
01:32:32.210 --> 01:32:36.190
their housing or something along those lines and just keep them on the payroll.

1613
01:32:36.210 --> 01:32:38.200
Like that was,
there was a,
um,

1614
01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:43.270
Kathleen Madigan was here and she lives in this certain part of Hollywood where

1615
01:32:43.271 --> 01:32:46.360
they have all these like really nice bungalows,
really cool small houses.

1616
01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:49.330
And she was like,
that's where the studio heads just to keep their mistresses,

1617
01:32:49.810 --> 01:32:51.930
they still like put them up in these houses.

1618
01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:55.510
I was like so common that there was a whole neighborhood,
if that's hilarious.

1619
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:58.810
It's not.
Stop to think about that.
I mean,
if prostitution is illegal,

1620
01:32:58.811 --> 01:33:02.680
what's going on there?
Well there's that whole website,
a sugar daddy.com.

1621
01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:05.890
You know,
where a lot of,
uh,
you know,

1622
01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:10.840
young female ladies from Hollywood or on and it's guys with money looking for,

1623
01:33:10.841 --> 01:33:14.980
you know,
companionship.
That's a good place to get poisoned.
What do you mean?

1624
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:18.230
If I was a check that was looking at Stila God's money and poisoned him,

1625
01:33:18.370 --> 01:33:22.660
that's where I'd look.
Go find your sugar down the old fashioned way.

1626
01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:25.600
Getting a sugar daddy on the Internet,
Jesus Christ,
whatever happened,

1627
01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:30.370
whatever happened to old fashioned interaction between your Tinder to people

1628
01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:33.220
looking at each other in the eyes that I need to know each other and me having

1629
01:33:33.221 --> 01:33:35.740
an understanding person to person.
It's really primal now.

1630
01:33:35.741 --> 01:33:38.870
Either you're pretty or you're not.
Not just looking online,

1631
01:33:38.871 --> 01:33:41.920
not just being some creepy old dude with a credit card going,
well,

1632
01:33:41.921 --> 01:33:43.140
I'm only just shuttle wiring.

1633
01:33:43.141 --> 01:33:47.200
I will buy your wrenches and one as it's lost him $2,000 a month.
Right?

1634
01:33:47.290 --> 01:33:51.930
I don't have time for a woman on my wife.
I'm 73 years old.
Oh.
Like my balls.
Like,

1635
01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:56.620
well,
I was in a,
when I was in,
uh,
uh,
Diego Garcia,

1636
01:33:57.220 --> 01:34:01.070
which is this rant,
this small island in the middle of nowhere and isn't it?

1637
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:02.400
It's a military eyes.

1638
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:05.830
An island named Diego Garcia and they don't know who that dude is.

1639
01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:08.560
That's ridiculous.
Did they just run out of names?
No,

1640
01:34:08.561 --> 01:34:13.090
it was that when they got there,
that's the name of the island.
Who named it.

1641
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:15.400
They don't,
whoever was there before them,

1642
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:20.260
it was some Portuguese explorer who just randomly found this island.

1643
01:34:20.770 --> 01:34:23.970
That's hilarious.
What a dickhead.
He named it after himself.
Well,

1644
01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:27.460
I guess isn't that the idea of America?
America was poochy.
Yeah.

1645
01:34:27.670 --> 01:34:30.970
I mean I don't allegedly,
I don't know anything about that,

1646
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:33.370
but there's a Snopes thing on that.
I should probably look that up.

1647
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:37.180
America Snopes ever cook can,

1648
01:34:37.181 --> 01:34:40.240
I think that's one of those things that's not true,

1649
01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:44.440
but everybody always says it like,
um,
uh,

1650
01:34:44.441 --> 01:34:47.440
like one of them is that they used to burn witches.
She's,
you know,

1651
01:34:47.441 --> 01:34:48.760
they didn't really used to burn witches.

1652
01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:51.460
They didn't burn witches that didn't burn witches.
Man.

1653
01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:55.390
What they do these hang them.
Jesus,
the burning of the,
which thing?

1654
01:34:55.391 --> 01:34:58.220
It's like this really common thing that's in our heads,

1655
01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:03.600
but they used to do apparently when the only time a named,

1656
01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:04.910
um,

1657
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:09.910
the only time they did it on a regular basis was a religious times during Europe

1658
01:35:10.850 --> 01:35:14.330
during,
uh,
like I think like during the Martin Luther time,

1659
01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:16.820
I think they did a lot of burning.
They're burned.

1660
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.970
People didn't believe or just were different.

1661
01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:23.800
<v 2>Or if you didn't like somebody just called him a witch and then they had to</v>

1662
01:35:23.801 --> 01:35:28.750
prove they're not a witch.
Yeah.
Uh,
he just completely random.
Yeah.

1663
01:35:28.751 --> 01:35:31.670
That's hilarious that you would have to prove that you're not a,
which they did.

1664
01:35:31.671 --> 01:35:34.720
They do stuff where it's like,
if you like,

1665
01:35:34.721 --> 01:35:37.630
there's no way to prove you whenever it's like Dave Duncan water,

1666
01:35:37.631 --> 01:35:40.770
and if you lived,
you are,
which if you died you weren't,
which,

1667
01:35:40.810 --> 01:35:43.630
so it's like you're damned if you do.
You're damned if you don't

1668
01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:47.380
<v 1>America best preachy America.</v>

1669
01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:54.520
<v 2>God,
I need to get an American at this man.
I need sunlight.
Liquid.</v>

1670
01:35:54.850 --> 01:35:59.330
You look at that.
Bam.
Pyre legged.
This loose some weight.
Oh,
name male is,

1671
01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:04.220
you said it first.
I mean human being the fuck you said it.
Fries,
feelings.
Um,

1672
01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:08.140
snopes.com slowest fuck slopes.

1673
01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:12.850
Dotcom slow is shitty ass website for all your shitty ass information.

1674
01:36:12.851 --> 01:36:15.610
You need it.
slopes.com.
Apparently this is another story.

1675
01:36:16.690 --> 01:36:19.420
<v 1>Oh God,
this is too confusing.
I'm not going to read all this.</v>

1676
01:36:19.570 --> 01:36:24.460
This is a t l d r too long didn't read.
I love that.

1677
01:36:24.461 --> 01:36:27.610
When I see that I'm posts too long.
Didn't read you here.

1678
01:36:27.611 --> 01:36:30.790
They found water on Mars.
What?
Eh?
Yeah.

1679
01:36:30.791 --> 01:36:34.120
Water discovered on Mars by the rover.
The rover curiosity.

1680
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:38.530
Substantial discovery made after an analysis of soil samples from the planet

1681
01:36:38.531 --> 01:36:40.170
surfaces has

1682
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:41.360
<v 2>uncovered water.</v>

1683
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:45.500
Isn't that the whole thing about the behold a pale horse that they say we're

1684
01:36:45.501 --> 01:36:49.660
going to go and colonize Mars?
Well,
I think if people stay

1685
01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:52.290
<v 1>alive for the next thousand years,
we will.</v>

1686
01:36:52.710 --> 01:36:57.060
I think it's going to take a long fucking time and some crazy motherfucker is

1687
01:36:57.061 --> 01:36:58.350
going to have to go over there first.

1688
01:36:58.770 --> 01:37:01.590
There's going to be some people that will go over there and it's a god damn one

1689
01:37:01.591 --> 01:37:03.180
way trip,
man.
You never coming back.

1690
01:37:03.181 --> 01:37:06.450
You're going to go over there once and that's it.
That's where you live now.

1691
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:09.510
Are you ready?
Go.
And if that doesn't work or you run out of air,

1692
01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:13.080
you're going to suffocate via satellite and we're going to get to watch it all

1693
01:37:13.081 --> 01:37:13.660
on our phones

1694
01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:17.420
<v 2>and that will be on live leak.com oh quickly.
It'll be live streaming.</v>

1695
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:19.690
The guy will die on TV.
Just like the challenger accident.
I mean,

1696
01:37:19.691 --> 01:37:22.120
there's no way you're gonna be able to stop it.
No one's gonna.

1697
01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:25.780
It's not the odds of them being able to get all the way to Mars and not a couple

1698
01:37:25.781 --> 01:37:28.180
of people not make it.
That's crazy.

1699
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:31.570
When they build a Las Vegas Hotel Casino,

1700
01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:34.810
they average in three people die.
Do they really?
Yeah.

1701
01:37:34.811 --> 01:37:37.960
They assume three people going to die along the way of building this hotel.

1702
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:40.930
That's cause it was three people didn't know how to keep the fucking mouth shut.

1703
01:37:41.170 --> 01:37:44.260
Yeah.
I mean,
I'm sure you did.
They take care of a couple of people.
I'm sure.

1704
01:37:44.261 --> 01:37:48.670
Like the building high rises,
someone slips,
falls called it a day.
Oh No.

1705
01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:51.850
I can't imagine how many people are going to lose on the way to Mars.
Well,

1706
01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:56.100
I think I really liked the idea of a sending,
you know,

1707
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.130
<v 1>the way they're doing it,
like with this curiosity,
they can learn a lot of shit.</v>

1708
01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:02.010
They can,
they can do analytics on soil.

1709
01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:04.380
They can send back photographs and information.

1710
01:38:04.410 --> 01:38:06.420
They can do a lot of things without risking people's lives,

1711
01:38:07.170 --> 01:38:10.560
but as long as as human beings just going to be the one person wants to be the

1712
01:38:10.561 --> 01:38:14.040
first guy that lands on Mars,
he wants to be the Neil Armstrong with Mars.

1713
01:38:14.370 --> 01:38:17.610
There's always going to be one of those guys.
There's always somebody.
Yeah.

1714
01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:21.180
Who wants to be the explorer sometimes man,
you get lost in the whole,

1715
01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:23.790
I would have to say that.
I think if they're going to do that,

1716
01:38:23.791 --> 01:38:27.210
the first thing they would probably do is try that out on the moon.

1717
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:32.280
Try some like terraforming,
go over there,
try to build some sort of structure.

1718
01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:37.070
They've even figured out how to make walls using the sand and the the,

1719
01:38:37.071 --> 01:38:42.071
the the the dirt of the moon and in a three d printer they figured out a way to

1720
01:38:42.630 --> 01:38:44.920
bond this.
Have you seen that Jamie?
This,
this photos of it?
Yeah.

1721
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:48.540
Three d printer use to build base on the moon.
Yeah.

1722
01:38:48.541 --> 01:38:53.541
They've devised this a three d printer that they think they can transport

1723
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:55.470
printer to boost.

1724
01:38:56.130 --> 01:38:59.550
Didn't they want to send like a married couple in this space for us.

1725
01:38:59.551 --> 01:39:01.770
And then they halfway there,
she wasn't,
she gives up,

1726
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.970
she'll be deep sex with them anymore and he disappears.
And he goes on.

1727
01:39:05.971 --> 01:39:08.790
Melissa Gorg on him.
And uh,
he,
uh,

1728
01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:11.820
he winds up taking her just like that guy in the book.

1729
01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:16.200
God gave him some Shit at New Jersey.
He rapes her on TV.

1730
01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:17.760
Um,
yeah,

1731
01:39:17.761 --> 01:39:21.780
building a lunar base with three d printing.

1732
01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:25.800
This is a,
what they're planning on doing it.
There's a,
there's actually a,

1733
01:39:25.801 --> 01:39:30.420
an animated thing.
Uh,
we could see the,
the,
the Mo,

1734
01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:33.870
the rover move,
move the rover move.
But look at these photos.

1735
01:39:34.030 --> 01:39:38.480
This is plan C,
that photo,
the honeycomb.
This is,
um,

1736
01:39:38.970 --> 01:39:41.730
the three d printer,
um,

1737
01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:46.970
is going to be able to make these walls that are essentially just some compound

1738
01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:54.660
that's created with the soil.
Wow.
Yeah,

1739
01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:55.890
it's a one that right there,

1740
01:39:55.891 --> 01:40:00.891
that photograph is a 1.5 ton building block that was produced as a demonstration

1741
01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:05.340
of the three d printing techniques using simulated lunar soil.

1742
01:40:05.370 --> 01:40:07.650
So they did it with something that would be like,
you know,

1743
01:40:07.651 --> 01:40:12.030
similar in consistency and the design is based on a hollow closed cell structure

1744
01:40:12.031 --> 01:40:16.410
reminiscent of bird bones to give a good combination of strength and weight.

1745
01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:21.600
So they would fly this printer up there and then just start building these walls

1746
01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:25.320
with this printer out of the lunar soil.
Man.

1747
01:40:25.321 --> 01:40:29.070
My printer always jams had suck if you were up there and your printer jams.

1748
01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:33.300
Ha Yeah.
Absence Sandy.
Some new shit.

1749
01:40:33.450 --> 01:40:37.140
Can you send me some,
some quick sum it up here.
Yeah.

1750
01:40:37.141 --> 01:40:39.750
I need to clean my heads or something.
I'm out of the blue ink.

1751
01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:43.020
Well the idea is that,
you know,
there'll be able to,

1752
01:40:43.110 --> 01:40:48.110
they know that they can fly shit up there that can do this so they could

1753
01:40:48.421 --> 01:40:53.421
actually send some sort of rover type robotic thing up there with these printers

1754
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:59.720
and build these houses before we even get there.
Jesus,
they just flew,

1755
01:41:00.250 --> 01:41:04.270
I think it was an f 16.
They flew it as a,
um,
as a drone.

1756
01:41:04.690 --> 01:41:09.690
They successfully fluent and landed it and they achieve supersonic speeds all

1757
01:41:09.761 --> 01:41:11.200
done completely as a drone.

1758
01:41:12.150 --> 01:41:16.360
This is for the first tie end at air force base.
Wow.
Yeah.
They just did this.

1759
01:41:16.361 --> 01:41:19.770
This was a here,
I'll pull this up.
When did the robots take over?
Well,

1760
01:41:19.771 --> 01:41:24.460
it's getting close.
That's my point.
Uh,
what about combining?

1761
01:41:24.461 --> 01:41:26.740
What robots are we going to,
I'm going to miss all the cool shit.

1762
01:41:27.670 --> 01:41:32.140
I'm born too early or too late.
Know you're going to be fine.
F 16th drone.
Yeah,

1763
01:41:32.330 --> 01:41:36.070
and the F 16,
man,
there's a video of it to pull it up,
dude.
Uh,

1764
01:41:36.130 --> 01:41:40.510
F 16 drone fighter jet flies without pilot.
It's fucking incredible,
man.

1765
01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:45.160
My point is if they can do this,
they can also get some,
I mean,

1766
01:41:45.161 --> 01:41:49.360
they can get the rover to land on the moon.
They can also,
or on on Mars.

1767
01:41:49.361 --> 01:41:50.860
They can also get one to land on the moon.

1768
01:41:50.861 --> 01:41:54.100
They get something more complex now because the rover's a few year old,

1769
01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.230
a few years old now,
and you know,

1770
01:41:56.231 --> 01:41:59.460
who knows what they're going to have 10 years from now.
They're gonna have like,

1771
01:41:59.470 --> 01:42:02.920
look at this.
This is a fucking jet flying with no one in it.

1772
01:42:03.490 --> 01:42:07.670
They're doing it all completely remote.
Look at that.
That's the same as,

1773
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:11.800
is that good or bad for us?
I'm not good.
Not Good.

1774
01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:15.880
I'm just that dude that's bad for humans.
It's bad for mankind.

1775
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:19.090
Well these things are gonna start thinking.
I mean right now it's just stupid.

1776
01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:22.660
But one day they're going to make one that's really fucking smart and it's going

1777
01:42:22.661 --> 01:42:25.510
to be like the car's cartoon where they talk to each other.

1778
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:29.560
I don't want to bomb Iraq
and bomb DC.

1779
01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:34.420
This ends bad for mankind.
I mean,
do these guys watch Scifi flicks?
How do you,

1780
01:42:34.450 --> 01:42:36.310
how do you call yourself a test pilot if you're on the ground?

1781
01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:39.220
Cause it says test pilot.

1782
01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:42.330
<v 4>This is why I became an into this program is the,</v>

1783
01:42:42.510 --> 01:42:45.810
to me are the epitome of my career.
This is what it was all about.
I mean,

1784
01:42:45.811 --> 01:42:47.020
to be able to take this area,

1785
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:51.560
<v 1>oh,
about slaving mankind,
our robot overlords.
That's what it's all about.</v>

1786
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:56.690
God.
Yeah.
You know when the opening sequence of the terminator movie,

1787
01:42:56.691 --> 01:42:59.350
the first one where the terminators are walking around,

1788
01:42:59.370 --> 01:43:03.560
you see them stepping on skulls and stuff and you see those giant flying robot.

1789
01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:08.630
That's drones,
man.
100% it's,
it's real.
It's all common.

1790
01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:11.240
I mean,
whether or not they're actually going to be against humanity,

1791
01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:13.960
my feeling is robots,

1792
01:43:13.961 --> 01:43:17.120
unless we programmed them to have survival instincts won't.

1793
01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:19.660
So they won't see us as a threat and you know,

1794
01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:23.060
I don't think they'll have any biological instincts at all at the the need to

1795
01:43:23.061 --> 01:43:25.610
survive.
They need to stay on or be on or off.

1796
01:43:25.650 --> 01:43:29.240
I don't think unless we program them with those ideas,

1797
01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:31.280
they're not going to have those ideas naturally.

1798
01:43:31.281 --> 01:43:32.660
I don't think those are natural ideas.

1799
01:43:32.661 --> 01:43:37.550
I think those ideas had been sort of like they've grown inside the human animal

1800
01:43:37.551 --> 01:43:38.420
from a long,

1801
01:43:38.421 --> 01:43:43.010
long life on this planet and various forms from single cell,

1802
01:43:43.011 --> 01:43:46.610
the multicell to Malmo to you know,

1803
01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:49.970
ape to whatever the fuck we are now.
It's a long ass process.

1804
01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:52.460
How long til chick start banging robots?

1805
01:43:52.510 --> 01:43:55.460
<v 3>Then we got to compete with robots real quick.
There are any bang and robots.</v>

1806
01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:56.840
They already have like the Sib,

1807
01:43:56.841 --> 01:44:01.841
Ian's and dildos and men just got the fleshlight really recently and the

1808
01:44:01.881 --> 01:44:04.900
flashlight is totally manual.
You've got to grab it stick anyway.

1809
01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:09.590
You got to do it all yourself.
Women have things that fuck them.

1810
01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.240
They have things that will fuck them.

1811
01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:16.540
They have vibrators now in cvs we make you buy vibrators and put it on and drive

1812
01:44:16.641 --> 01:44:20.060
home.
Yeah,
they have those back massagers things.

1813
01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:23.080
Big Ground Rubber Ball,
back massager thing.

1814
01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:27.530
It's robots beat in the been doing nothing,
chilling.
Now it's going to happen.

1815
01:44:27.531 --> 01:44:29.640
There's no way you're going to be able to stop that can come home.

1816
01:44:29.670 --> 01:44:32.760
Your girlfriend's getting shagged by a transformer.
You're fucked.
You have.

1817
01:44:32.930 --> 01:44:35.330
If robots were are created by women,

1818
01:44:35.331 --> 01:44:37.970
that's what we're going to be really fucked because they're going to make robots

1819
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.660
that are exactly the way they want.
A man who just sensitive with big Dicks,

1820
01:44:42.661 --> 01:44:46.910
just weak bitches,
just weak pitches that listened to them.
Skinny jeans.

1821
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:48.470
I mean if you get allow,

1822
01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:52.930
if you could allow like really angry feminists to program robots to be any a

1823
01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:56.780
male robot,
to be anything they want it to be.
How would those guys be?

1824
01:44:56.781 --> 01:45:00.770
Would they be really sensitive and just fun to be around and really nice or

1825
01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:06.040
would they just be smeeds meek little email comic hale alt comics

1826
01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:13.920
guys just stand there in front of a microphone and don't even move and uh,

1827
01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:17.810
mentally,
easily the push around all comics,

1828
01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:23.480
male feminists comics,
there's just a male feminist and she's,

1829
01:45:23.490 --> 01:45:25.310
I don't know why it's all,
it's everywhere.

1830
01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:28.220
It's just what you said earlier is that people don't want to,

1831
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:30.470
they don't want to catch up.
They just want to stay,

1832
01:45:30.471 --> 01:45:33.900
stay lazy and they want everybody else to slow down too.
Yeah.
It's,

1833
01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:38.390
it's dumbing the masses.
It's not even dumb.
A lot of all people aren't dumb.

1834
01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:40.490
They're very smart,
very smart.
Just weak.

1835
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:44.960
I think sometimes Clever's more important than funny sometimes.
Well,
it's,

1836
01:45:44.961 --> 01:45:48.050
they're trying to play to the back of the room a lot.
There's a lot of that,

1837
01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.550
you know,
I think you see that a lot.
Like,
oh,
I watch,
I'm like,
wow,
that's clever,

1838
01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:57.750
but I'm not necessarily going,
Hahaha.
Allowed.
Well,
we had,
um,

1839
01:45:57.830 --> 01:46:00.890
Matt full tron in here and he was talking about how that kind of like fucked him

1840
01:46:00.891 --> 01:46:04.460
up in his career because he used to write for the back of the room and he wasn't

1841
01:46:04.461 --> 01:46:05.420
writing for the crowd.

1842
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:09.440
And then he realized once he started going on the road like,
oh,
I fucked up.

1843
01:46:09.441 --> 01:46:13.280
Like I'm writing for a bunch of people that are like cynical and they've heard

1844
01:46:13.281 --> 01:46:15.640
every joke in the book and they don't really want to see common anymore.

1845
01:46:15.650 --> 01:46:19.790
They want to see something,
some unexpected.
Yeah.
Animal attack.

1846
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.740
When they want to see something unexpected,

1847
01:46:21.741 --> 01:46:24.200
they want to see something that's not really standup comedy.

1848
01:46:24.201 --> 01:46:26.920
They want it to be like ironic.
But when you,
you know,

1849
01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:29.510
when you pay money to go on the road and you're in buffalo and you got to do

1850
01:46:29.511 --> 01:46:33.350
standup at a comedy club,
that ironic shit ain't gonna fly.
Nope.
And so the,

1851
01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:35.390
you know,
he was saying that he found that and I was like,
oh,

1852
01:46:35.391 --> 01:46:39.050
I was writing jokes for comedians.
I wasn't even writing for humans.
Well,

1853
01:46:39.051 --> 01:46:42.650
it gets interesting when you do every level of comedy,
like open Mikes,

1854
01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:45.410
you're playing the comedian,
so you kind of got to learn.

1855
01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:48.260
That was a big thing for me because I get,

1856
01:46:48.261 --> 01:46:50.280
the first five years I did standup comedy,

1857
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:54.540
<v 2>I just played bars.
I mean just like roadhouse bars,</v>

1858
01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:58.440
like instant Vegas.
Yeah,
just this crazy boss.
I couldn't,

1859
01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:02.130
at that time they weren't letting locals play the comedy clubs because they

1860
01:47:02.131 --> 01:47:05.100
could just fly out comics from a la.

1861
01:47:05.190 --> 01:47:10.190
So we had the maid or make our own scene and I would just find crazy bar gigs.

1862
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:12.240
Like anywhere I could perform,

1863
01:47:12.241 --> 01:47:16.080
like we would go in between bands like you'd have band,

1864
01:47:16.081 --> 01:47:18.570
like hard metal bands playing,

1865
01:47:18.690 --> 01:47:22.380
bring out the comedians and I would have to go out and just deal with all the

1866
01:47:22.381 --> 01:47:25.350
hecklers,
shut them up,
and then bring the other comedians on.

1867
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:28.770
We would take any kind of Gig like that.
Now when do you,
when you started,

1868
01:47:28.771 --> 01:47:33.060
what year was it like a,
I've been doing it for like 16 years,

1869
01:47:33.061 --> 01:47:38.061
so like 90969790690 seven what was the scene like in Vegas?

1870
01:47:41.821 --> 01:47:45.500
Like,
how did you start out dead?
How would you,
how would he start out if you're,

1871
01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:49.890
when I started,
there was one open mic every other week in the entire city.

1872
01:47:50.490 --> 01:47:53.150
There was nothing,
nobody who had been working at.

1873
01:47:53.170 --> 01:47:56.070
And I've been doing it and I'm just like,
I've got to get up.

1874
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:59.670
So I just decided to create my own comedy gigs.

1875
01:47:59.671 --> 01:48:03.060
And what I would do is I would just,
every night I would find a dead bar.

1876
01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:06.510
I'm like,
your bars debt,
let me have the night and I'll get it going.

1877
01:48:06.511 --> 01:48:10.320
And I would create an open mic in which I would host and I would do,
you know,

1878
01:48:10.321 --> 01:48:13.350
get the crowd going,
deal with the hecklers,
bring up the comedians.

1879
01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:16.200
And then I had my own,
uh,
Improv troupe,

1880
01:48:16.530 --> 01:48:20.640
which we started and we gotten to all the station casinos.

1881
01:48:20.641 --> 01:48:25.080
So I had open mikes going one place,
my improv troupe performing another place.

1882
01:48:25.230 --> 01:48:29.550
And that's just how I,
uh,
perform forever.
That's very smart,
man.

1883
01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:33.300
That's very genius of you.
It's Kinda how I am right now.

1884
01:48:33.301 --> 01:48:36.360
It's like I have a stern certain style of comedy I like to do.

1885
01:48:36.361 --> 01:48:40.230
So I create my own environment and in which to do it at,
which is,
you know,

1886
01:48:40.231 --> 01:48:43.980
the naughty show or the,
you know,
uh,
comedy,

1887
01:48:43.981 --> 01:48:46.320
rap battles and stuff like that.
I just,

1888
01:48:46.321 --> 01:48:50.550
that's why I enjoy doing so I could create a brand that's very smart of you

1889
01:48:50.551 --> 01:48:53.610
though.
It shows a lot of get up and go.
There you go.
All right.
You know what?

1890
01:48:53.611 --> 01:48:55.440
Someone's going to do this.
Let me put this shit together.

1891
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:57.730
I wish I could play a little more bald too.
I guess I,

1892
01:48:57.760 --> 01:48:59.640
I'm so focused on creating my own things.

1893
01:48:59.641 --> 01:49:03.810
I'd like to do just the normal stuff too,
but I really enjoy these shows.

1894
01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:05.220
Like it's what I enjoy doing.

1895
01:49:05.221 --> 01:49:07.560
That's why I'm very passionate about something wrong with that.
What I'm,

1896
01:49:07.561 --> 01:49:11.280
what I'm saying is it showed a lot of get up and go on your part to like start

1897
01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:15.960
these nights and put these things together and have comedy shows where there was

1898
01:49:15.961 --> 01:49:17.970
nothing else.
They're going on a lot.
Other people go,
ah,

1899
01:49:17.971 --> 01:49:20.240
I can't do it in the city.
You know,
you,
you either,

1900
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:23.250
that was a very ingenious sort of a way we'll work around,
you know,

1901
01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:26.400
industrious of you said there's a way around us.

1902
01:49:26.730 --> 01:49:30.410
If no book me and there's no shows.
I got to make my own shows and I will just,

1903
01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:32.680
you know,
it's very blessed that growing up,
uh,

1904
01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:36.150
we didn't physically fight with each other.
We just racked each other.

1905
01:49:36.151 --> 01:49:39.570
We were like verbally fishes.
All my buddies in high school,

1906
01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:44.260
all of them were like victims of divorce.
Their pants they were doing,

1907
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:47.980
they were kind of hurt children in weird way.
They like they,
they

1908
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.660
<v 3>had a weird off family.
They were,</v>

1909
01:49:49.690 --> 01:49:52.900
they came from loving parents but the parents were divorced.
It affected them.

1910
01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:56.530
They were kind of like her children.
So we were vicious with each other.

1911
01:49:56.531 --> 01:49:59.500
I remember like moments where we'd go to a local pizzeria,

1912
01:49:59.501 --> 01:50:02.560
pawn tilos and whoever got sat in the wrong seat,

1913
01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:06.070
you are going to get pounded on all night by everybody and they wouldn't let you

1914
01:50:06.071 --> 01:50:08.230
up from the booth and it would just boom,
boom,
boom.

1915
01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:09.730
And you would just get vicious.

1916
01:50:09.731 --> 01:50:13.630
And I just learned to not take it personal and just hit back and it's like,

1917
01:50:13.930 --> 01:50:16.840
to this day that's really helped me with hecklers.
I just,
you know,

1918
01:50:16.841 --> 01:50:19.750
I don't really think I just react now.
So,
uh,
yeah.

1919
01:50:19.751 --> 01:50:23.800
I mean I had always had something like that.
It was just where I came from.

1920
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:27.010
Do you find though that when you're dealing with an actual polite crowd that

1921
01:50:27.011 --> 01:50:28.990
wants to hear material,
they like,
hey,
I don't know,

1922
01:50:28.991 --> 01:50:31.600
is throwing anything at me again.
It is weird.

1923
01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:36.520
I have to learn to tell them how much I liked them too.
That was my transition.

1924
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:40.840
I had a problem with that when I went from bars to do nicer comedy club.

1925
01:50:40.841 --> 01:50:44.710
I was a different transition.
I was ready.
I was like,
not ready,

1926
01:50:44.711 --> 01:50:49.360
but I was used to combat comedy.
You know,
like I had a,
I didn't do what you did.

1927
01:50:49.361 --> 01:50:52.330
I didn't,
I never created my own thing.
But I did a lot of bars.

1928
01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:55.000
We did a lot of bars,
but it was,
they were already created for me.

1929
01:50:55.390 --> 01:50:56.470
I got super lucky.

1930
01:50:56.471 --> 01:51:01.471
I came along in Boston in the 80s there was so much work in town that you never

1931
01:51:01.601 --> 01:51:02.434
had to leave.

1932
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:07.470
You could be a full time professional comedian and work from one to two and a

1933
01:51:07.481 --> 01:51:07.781
half,

1934
01:51:07.781 --> 01:51:11.890
three hours drive at the most for gigs and you would work almost every week and

1935
01:51:11.891 --> 01:51:13.630
every day.
I mean,
you can do whatever you want it.

1936
01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:17.380
There's so much work during the weekdays for mostly free stuff.
You know,

1937
01:51:17.381 --> 01:51:20.080
where you,
where you would take,
you know,
take your time and get tight.

1938
01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:24.460
But then on the weekends,
and it's a lot of weekday gigs,
there's just,
you know,

1939
01:51:24.461 --> 01:51:28.630
drive to New Hampshire,
drive to a western Massachusetts,
drive to Maine,

1940
01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:31.540
drive to Attleboro drive to Marlborough,

1941
01:51:31.541 --> 01:51:36.040
drive to here and you got to use to these really fucking terrible places

1942
01:51:36.050 --> 01:51:39.580
standing on top of milk crates and nobody's paying attention and the hockey

1943
01:51:39.581 --> 01:51:44.530
games on.
I went to Montreal before I ever played a common,

1944
01:51:44.590 --> 01:51:49.180
a real I before I was,
I was a regular at any comedy club.

1945
01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:51.850
When you say mantra,
you mean the festival I got,

1946
01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:56.940
I had just came to la and I was just a ball of fire and I got picked up and they

1947
01:51:57.491 --> 01:51:59.920
brought me to mound trail.
I didn't even know what it was at the time.

1948
01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:05.460
The only time I'd ever play the club was about a year before I'd opened for Nick

1949
01:52:06.250 --> 01:52:10.420
Depalo at the,
uh,
at the,
the Riviera,

1950
01:52:10.450 --> 01:52:15.440
which was booked by the guy who eventually went on to be a on the soprano.

1951
01:52:15.441 --> 01:52:18.550
Steve.
Sure.
Rip Up Bobby.
Yeah,
the big guy.

1952
01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:21.100
So that was the first time I ever played calmed me cause I've never really

1953
01:52:21.101 --> 01:52:23.730
played great guy.
Shrimp is awesome.
You know what,
man,

1954
01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:26.320
once in a while I rub people the wrong way.
I don't know why.

1955
01:52:26.321 --> 01:52:28.630
Just people in authority,
I,
they,
I make them nervous,

1956
01:52:28.631 --> 01:52:32.470
but there's certain people that they were in that we're an tourist for being

1957
01:52:32.471 --> 01:52:35.230
prickly.
There were always really,
really nice to me.

1958
01:52:35.231 --> 01:52:39.190
Like Dan Mer in Tempe Improv.
You'd always hear these crazy stories about him,

1959
01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:43.600
but he was the nicest do to me.
I was so thankful for her and Steve Shrimp.

1960
01:52:43.601 --> 01:52:46.310
Oh was the same way like this guy was in the tourist thorny

1961
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:50.390
<v 2>dude.
Nice do,
but could that,
you know,
bust some balls.
Always really nice to me.</v>

1962
01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:53.960
[inaudible] is just fair.
If you are a Douche,
he would just call you on it.

1963
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:57.020
That was the what,
what what it was,
you're not a dickhead.
He's finally,

1964
01:52:57.050 --> 01:52:58.780
I never had a problem with shrimp,
but he's a great guy,

1965
01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:01.700
was just really nice to me,
gave me spots,

1966
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:04.250
made me feel like I had a chance in something.

1967
01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:08.060
I was the first comic to ever get booked twice at his club out of Vegas at the

1968
01:53:08.061 --> 01:53:12.080
time and it was just such an amazing feeling and working with the Apollo was

1969
01:53:12.081 --> 01:53:15.110
just like who I'd always looked up to.
It was real funny.

1970
01:53:15.111 --> 01:53:18.890
It was great because I was performing with him and he was having a fight with

1971
01:53:18.891 --> 01:53:19.820
his girlfriend at the time.

1972
01:53:19.850 --> 01:53:23.120
I mean a full on brawls like before he got on stage they'd be screaming each

1973
01:53:23.121 --> 01:53:25.070
other,
go up and perform,
get off stage,

1974
01:53:25.190 --> 01:53:28.340
tell me what a great job I did and then go back to arguing with his girlfriend.

1975
01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:33.950
I got to get him on.
He's,
he's got something coming up.

1976
01:53:33.951 --> 01:53:38.210
We actually have been going back and forth with email whenever he's a in La

1977
01:53:38.211 --> 01:53:41.120
again.
We'll definitely have one of the funniest dudes,
man heads.

1978
01:53:41.121 --> 01:53:43.460
Some of the funniest jokes I've ever heard.

1979
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:45.470
What the fuck happened with him and already Lang do you,

1980
01:53:45.530 --> 01:53:47.960
do you know what happened there?
No,
I was just told that you know,

1981
01:53:47.961 --> 01:53:51.890
he won't talk more sports and already wanted to just shoot the shit.
You know I,

1982
01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.290
that's all I heard.
That doesn't seem right.

1983
01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:57.830
It seems like already loves talking sports too and you know,
they can't like,

1984
01:53:57.860 --> 01:53:58.693
I dunno what else.

1985
01:53:58.940 --> 01:54:02.150
I have a really great sports podcast too called punching in sports.

1986
01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:03.760
You don't like my sports podcast?

1987
01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:07.490
You can't say I have a really great anything I do let you say hi.

1988
01:54:07.491 --> 01:54:09.940
I have a really great show.
I do love it.
I love that.

1989
01:54:09.941 --> 01:54:14.150
I believe the Ari and to Jason Tebow and that's kind of like people like it,

1990
01:54:14.151 --> 01:54:17.360
it's a sports podcast but they like when we talk about anything but sports,

1991
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:20.840
it's like really weird.
You know,
people like talking about anything,
man,

1992
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:23.450
they like people that talk about shit.
That's interesting.

1993
01:54:23.451 --> 01:54:27.110
And sometimes if you just had a sports podcast,
talked only about sports,

1994
01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:30.920
it wouldn't be as exciting as a sports podcasts that mostly talked about sports.

1995
01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:34.280
But if some other shit came up and it was interesting and you go,
oh,

1996
01:54:34.281 --> 01:54:37.250
we can't talk about that.
That's the beautiful thing about having a podcast.

1997
01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:39.650
Nobody can tell you that you can do whatever the fuck you want whenever you want

1998
01:54:39.651 --> 01:54:44.450
to do it.
Yeah,
I love it.
I love the uncensored is of a podcast.
I love it.

1999
01:54:44.630 --> 01:54:47.300
I love podcasting.
I love podcasting almost.

2000
01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:52.010
As much as I love doing standup and I love doing standup.
I love talking.

2001
01:54:53.630 --> 01:54:57.620
I'm with you 100% I agree with you saying my opinion,

2002
01:54:57.621 --> 01:55:00.890
I have opinions,
you know,
and some people get really mad at me.

2003
01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:04.730
They get so angry that they don't,
I don't share their opinion,

2004
01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:08.330
but it's just like I'm just talking.
That's always going to be the case,
man.

2005
01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:11.370
It's always going to be a bunch of people that get pretty pissed off.
They do.

2006
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:12.680
They get angry with me,

2007
01:55:12.681 --> 01:55:17.210
real rigid and the right people were rigid and their ideas.
Sam Tripoli,

2008
01:55:17.450 --> 01:55:20.150
I just in the middle of nowhere,
it's like,
and the things they you with you,

2009
01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:23.780
the things they say to me,
climate change is not real.
Right?

2010
01:55:24.170 --> 01:55:27.680
It's just the things they say to fucking moron.
There's so fishes.

2011
01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:29.750
I think a lot of times they just want you to respond.

2012
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:33.380
That's exactly what they want.
I would never,
you know,

2013
01:55:33.381 --> 01:55:35.660
back when I was growing up and I met somebody famous,

2014
01:55:35.661 --> 01:55:40.520
I would never be vicious to him like that.
Can you even imagine though,

2015
01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:44.160
what it's like growing up in this age where anybody you like,
you just reach

2016
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:48.000
<v 1>out and tell them their icon?
Well,
it makes nobody famous.</v>

2017
01:55:48.001 --> 01:55:51.810
There's nothing to spa.
You know,
certain that's not true.

2018
01:55:51.811 --> 01:55:54.870
It certainly makes people that other people talk about a lot.
You know,

2019
01:55:54.871 --> 01:55:57.180
if your puff Daddy,
you're famous,
no matter what area you live in,

2020
01:55:57.400 --> 01:55:59.700
the difference is you're no longer beyond reproach.

2021
01:55:59.730 --> 01:56:03.450
Somebody can get ahold of you and go,
you're fucking album sock to big fat.

2022
01:56:03.451 --> 01:56:07.200
Fuck good pile is shit.
Fuck you.
You Queer,
you can say whatever you want.

2023
01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:09.480
I said that about Emma.
I didn't say sorry.
I go,

2024
01:56:09.481 --> 01:56:13.980
I watched him on that like a college football halftime show and I go,

2025
01:56:13.981 --> 01:56:17.490
well it looks like,
yeah.
M&amp;Ms Back on drugs so the new album should rock.

2026
01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.410
I just tweeted that and dude,

2027
01:56:19.411 --> 01:56:24.411
every fake mnm Twitter account just started blasting me like five or six of them

2028
01:56:24.571 --> 01:56:27.000
just start calling me out.
And it was just some random,

2029
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:30.600
I didn't even Hashtag m and M and I just,

2030
01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:33.870
and it wasn't even mnm that said that it was just random.

2031
01:56:33.871 --> 01:56:36.660
People take fake m and m's,
M and m fans.

2032
01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:38.920
Well and you put out a little hate and he got a little,
again,

2033
01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:41.520
I don't think that was,
hey,
I said it was going to be a great album.

2034
01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:47.820
They don't want to think that it's the alcohol or the drugs that fuel the

2035
01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:50.560
creativity.
Sam Aaa and I don't think it does either from the gene.

2036
01:56:51.330 --> 01:56:54.810
I think it's genius.
You just hadn't be fucked up when you came up with the idea,

2037
01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:57.630
have you seen,
well you've seen the video of folks who haven't seen the video.

2038
01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:01.650
Jamie pull up that just the video of m and m tripping so people could say like

2039
01:57:01.890 --> 01:57:03.960
Sam Tripoli wasn't talking out of school.

2040
01:57:04.230 --> 01:57:09.060
I mean he like went way out of his way to look really fucked up.

2041
01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:11.940
I mean he was working at,
what are you talking about?

2042
01:57:11.941 --> 01:57:15.380
The video of m and m were the one that you commented on it.
He was like,

2043
01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:17.821
yeah,
that's,

2044
01:57:17.821 --> 01:57:21.990
that's like the Molly is hitting while he leaned forward and everything.

2045
01:57:22.910 --> 01:57:27.870
Looking at him like,
come on.
His mouth is wide open.

2046
01:57:27.871 --> 01:57:32.871
He's leaning forward like severely leaning forward is rolling his eyes side

2047
01:57:32.971 --> 01:57:36.720
aside.
That's true.
I've been there.
I've been on shrooms.

2048
01:57:36.721 --> 01:57:39.810
I've had that moment where I'm like,
is this real life?

2049
01:57:39.870 --> 01:57:44.740
Is this his video they're playing?
They probably played it.

2050
01:57:46.650 --> 01:57:47.940
He was joking around,

2051
01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:51.740
obviously joking around a lot.

2052
01:57:53.550 --> 01:57:57.450
Maybe I don't even care.
I'm not judging is just barely paying attention.

2053
01:57:57.930 --> 01:58:01.140
Some old dude with a fucking suit on Berger who's great.

2054
01:58:01.170 --> 01:58:03.780
He's just like one of those old guys.
He just doesn't give a shit.

2055
01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:08.940
When I was old football guys.
Yeah,
now he's done.
He's done now.

2056
01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:12.050
Now he's back to normal.
Yeah man,
you put some hate out there,
Sam trip.

2057
01:58:12.051 --> 01:58:13.900
But he got it back.
It's,
hey,

2058
01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:20.190
I ain't judging am I to judge.
I've told my party and my day.
Well,

2059
01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:22.320
the point is that there's a lot of hate out there online.

2060
01:58:23.070 --> 01:58:27.270
Well there's a lot emotional reaction.
People want you to think their way.

2061
01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:29.850
They want you to like what they like,
they don't digest.

2062
01:58:29.851 --> 01:58:31.980
They just see word and they just react to it.

2063
01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:37.160
See Adam Levine and lady Gaga got it until a little Twitter beef and lady Gaga

2064
01:58:38.250 --> 01:58:39.060
owned him.

2065
01:58:39.060 --> 01:58:44.060
Really with one line cause a Adam Levine was like criticizing some of her work.

2066
01:58:45.251 --> 01:58:46.780
Like,
you know,
hey,
I'm proud.
He was like,

2067
01:58:46.781 --> 01:58:49.300
I'm proud to do pop music but this is blah blah blah blah blah.

2068
01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:53.950
And so you know something about art.
And so she comes back on and she goes,

2069
01:58:53.951 --> 01:58:58.870
oh look,
we got here guys.
It's the art police.
Yeah.
Well.
Oh guys,

2070
01:58:58.871 --> 01:59:02.200
the art police is here.
Come on,
look at his quote.

2071
01:59:02.230 --> 01:59:06.310
I unabashedly love writing and performing pop music for both myself and in

2072
01:59:06.311 --> 01:59:09.700
capital level letters.
Everyone around me.
That's it.

2073
01:59:09.850 --> 01:59:14.320
It doesn't need any extra sauce.
Shut your hole.

2074
01:59:14.321 --> 01:59:19.300
Pretty man.
Shut your dumb hole.
That's really funny,

2075
01:59:19.301 --> 01:59:23.660
man.
That's really funny.
She's the one beast with a couple people.
Yeah.

2076
01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:28.720
Hilton and Madonna that the three of them would go and look at his,
his quote.

2077
01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:30.010
Scroll it up.
What did he say?

2078
01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:35.200
Me thinks those dosed protests too much.

2079
01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:39.610
Yikes.
Shot Thou dost protest too much.
Shut up dude.

2080
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:43.000
By the way,
I'm not an artist.

2081
01:59:43.001 --> 01:59:46.030
I sang in a band and I make music with my friends.

2082
01:59:46.810 --> 01:59:51.310
Oh my God.
Yeah.
That's a self inflicted wound right there.
Well,
not only that,

2083
01:59:51.311 --> 01:59:55.000
what he just said,
I'm not an artist.
If you're not an artist,

2084
01:59:55.001 --> 01:59:58.000
you need to shut the fuck up.
If you're saying and you're not an artist,

2085
01:59:58.001 --> 02:00:01.510
what are you doing?
And I don't feel like she protested too much.
How about,

2086
02:00:01.511 --> 02:00:05.200
how has that though?
How was he not an artist?
Like what are we pretending?

2087
02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:08.380
Pretending this singing is not an art and I'm like,

2088
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:11.080
why you pretend a being self deprecating there?

2089
02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:14.170
I just feel like he shit on himself.
You've just basically say you're,

2090
02:00:14.410 --> 02:00:17.230
what you're doing is not artistic.
It's foolish.

2091
02:00:17.231 --> 02:00:21.870
Self deprecating tip deprecating behaviors.
What it is,
deprecation man.

2092
02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:24.330
Now he put out that one album where he just had his,

2093
02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:27.010
he just broke up with his girlfriend obviously.

2094
02:00:27.011 --> 02:00:30.070
She ripped his heart out and it was a pretty good album,

2095
02:00:30.071 --> 02:00:34.720
but the whole album was about her,
her bay basically breaking her heart man.

2096
02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:39.070
Breaking his heart.
Yeah.
The other way around.
Whenever he's a Dick,
this,
this,

2097
02:00:39.071 --> 02:00:42.610
this,
that,
that's silly.
Why do you give a fuck with Lady Gaga sings?

2098
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.390
You know why white guys,
you know,
I know it shouldn't say he's a Dick.

2099
02:00:46.391 --> 02:00:48.760
Maybe he's a nice guy who was drunk maybe fucked up.

2100
02:00:48.761 --> 02:00:51.550
Maybe he's in a bad frame of mind.
I don't know.
The guy just,
you know,

2101
02:00:51.551 --> 02:00:56.551
it goes back to your joke about all the sensitive white band guys.

2102
02:00:56.980 --> 02:00:58.300
There's a lot of that out there,

2103
02:00:58.430 --> 02:01:00.700
which a lot of those guys get into that position too.

2104
02:01:00.970 --> 02:01:04.150
There's also the thing that happens when people get into that sort of position

2105
02:01:04.151 --> 02:01:06.860
of prominence where they feel like they have to stand up,
you know,

2106
02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:10.450
for what's their idea of what's right.
You know,

2107
02:01:10.451 --> 02:01:12.870
so him shitting all over her music like,
c'mon,

2108
02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:17.290
I unabashedly performed pop music for myself and in capital letters.

2109
02:01:17.291 --> 02:01:19.540
Everyone around me like,
come on,

2110
02:01:19.930 --> 02:01:22.840
just that sentence shows me you're not that bright.

2111
02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:24.730
That's a not very bright sentence.

2112
02:01:24.900 --> 02:01:29.410
It's on a zoom call out other comics on like material and stuff like that.
Oh,

2113
02:01:29.411 --> 02:01:32.140
you can't do that.
Those kind of jokes.
And what do you give a fuck?

2114
02:01:32.170 --> 02:01:35.170
I've never called out anybody for anything other than stealing I,

2115
02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:37.150
that's why I agree wholeheartedly brother.

2116
02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:40.340
That's the only people that got problems with.
We both have friends at suck.

2117
02:01:40.730 --> 02:01:43.340
We know them.
We know those.
There's a few that hang around the store.

2118
02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:45.410
They've always been terrible.
They're always going to be terrible.

2119
02:01:45.411 --> 02:01:48.950
I hug him every time I see him.
I don't care.
You know,
as long as you're nice,

2120
02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:51.700
as long as you're nice offstage,
I don't care how you are.
I mean,

2121
02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:54.920
as long as you don't get crazy and want to ask me advice or you know,

2122
02:01:54.921 --> 02:01:57.230
try to get me to rewrite your jokes,
get alone.

2123
02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:00.110
There are some bad conversations that I've been out of.
Hey,

2124
02:02:00.230 --> 02:02:03.170
how do you think I should fix that?
Bit like,
oh,
come on man.

2125
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:06.500
This is not even possible.
I can't help you here.
But yeah,

2126
02:02:06.501 --> 02:02:09.980
it's hard to tag somebody else's stuff.
Not just hard to tag.

2127
02:02:09.981 --> 02:02:13.070
How do he make something funny that's not funny at all and someone comes up to

2128
02:02:13.071 --> 02:02:16.160
you?
I'm having a hard time with this.
This bit where I eat babies,

2129
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:20.870
I can't fucking clean it up just at the problem with me is I've watched so much

2130
02:02:20.871 --> 02:02:24.770
comedy in my life.
I can see when the tricks are coming.
There's tricks,

2131
02:02:24.771 --> 02:02:27.500
comics do some tricks and not judging them.
It's just the way it is.

2132
02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:31.910
It's Jedi mind tricks.
It's whatever I can,
I've watched it for so long.
I,

2133
02:02:31.911 --> 02:02:35.390
if I know your act before you walk on stage,
I just can't watch comedy.

2134
02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:38.750
It's very hard for me to watch comedy right now unless it's someone I've heard a

2135
02:02:38.751 --> 02:02:41.510
lot about or I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

2136
02:02:41.511 --> 02:02:42.810
I gotta be honest with you.
You're,

2137
02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:45.680
you're saying that and I experienced just the opposite.
I just can't watch.

2138
02:02:45.710 --> 02:02:48.740
I think you're very hard on a bunch of shitty comedian.
Maybe that's it.

2139
02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:52.760
Maybe I need to find a,
a funnier group of people,
but that's,
no,
really,
you're,

2140
02:02:52.761 --> 02:02:55.250
you're,
you're at the,
you're doing some shows,

2141
02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:58.390
like some of those late night spots at the store or whatever.

2142
02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:02.180
Open mic nights and certain places you can get around a bunch of tricks.

2143
02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:05.360
You're not supposed to watch those.
You know when those guys are there,

2144
02:03:05.361 --> 02:03:09.200
you get out of the room.
I just can't watch comedy.
That's not true.

2145
02:03:09.390 --> 02:03:11.810
Joey Diaz is going on stage.
You're going to watch.
I can watch him.

2146
02:03:11.811 --> 02:03:15.500
But those are the,
like the,
the legends,
you know.
But it's very hard for me.

2147
02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:18.470
And I'm not saying I'm anything better than anybody.
I just,

2148
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:21.950
I'm just a dude doing standup,
but it's just,
I can't watch it.

2149
02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.570
I'm gonna just don't watch the bad stuff too.
It's not that difficult.

2150
02:03:24.590 --> 02:03:28.280
I wish they'd tell me when they're bad so I don't walk in and see it.
Well,

2151
02:03:28.370 --> 02:03:31.910
you're going to get that.
People are trying shit out there trying to get good.

2152
02:03:32.210 --> 02:03:35.570
You're going to get bad.
Yeah.
Well on it though and I don't dwell on it.

2153
02:03:35.570 --> 02:03:39.020
Don't be all like fucking Adam,
whatever his name is.
Lou,

2154
02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:43.300
get all lady Gaga with people and what's his name?
Levine.

2155
02:03:43.470 --> 02:03:46.140
Pretty pretty bastard.
It's about this thing for the ladies.

2156
02:03:46.141 --> 02:03:49.520
It's tough to go through life being that handsome and not just get a delusional

2157
02:03:49.521 --> 02:03:53.540
sense of your own intelligence.
People like you so much.
Beautiful cheekbones.

2158
02:03:53.570 --> 02:03:55.930
She's girls just skin perfect amount of stubble.

2159
02:03:55.970 --> 02:03:58.310
You Lot just can cross it off your list.

2160
02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:02.890
All your sexual must do is you've got God,

2161
02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:06.870
it must be nice or not.
It's not natural.
You know,

2162
02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:08.720
you might maybe better off being a chimp.

2163
02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:13.460
Better off just doing an old school primates style that that trickery of like

2164
02:04:13.461 --> 02:04:15.800
being on a screen,
sing a certain song,

2165
02:04:15.801 --> 02:04:17.750
having them all going crazy and throwing panties at you.

2166
02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:20.420
It shits on natural when it comes down to he's got weak genes.

2167
02:04:20.421 --> 02:04:21.290
Look at this shit he's writing.

2168
02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:25.940
It's a little pea brain because that is how he feels or he knows that's what

2169
02:04:25.941 --> 02:04:28.940
will sell.
That statement that he said is it dumb statement?

2170
02:04:29.210 --> 02:04:31.550
The whole thing about it.
I unabashedly make pop music.

2171
02:04:31.551 --> 02:04:35.180
That's just something a dummy says like I'm not saying he's dumb mean he might

2172
02:04:35.181 --> 02:04:37.140
not be dumb.
Maybe it's just tough to get your,

2173
02:04:37.290 --> 02:04:40.430
your your expression out 140 characters.
Yeah,

2174
02:04:40.650 --> 02:04:44.370
but what do you see in it is it is,
you know,
it's way easier to do this.
I mean,

2175
02:04:44.371 --> 02:04:47.430
think about some of the shit that I've said so far that I had to clarify and

2176
02:04:47.431 --> 02:04:51.870
just the explaining myself about him.
So you're great with footnotes.

2177
02:04:51.871 --> 02:04:54.660
You explained to them you have footnotes.
Leave Lady Gaga.
First of all,

2178
02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:59.190
this is what you should pay attention to with lady Gaga,
her tremendous Hass.

2179
02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:00.271
That should be it.

2180
02:05:00.271 --> 02:05:03.450
She loves showing all you're paying attention to pull those pictures up of lady

2181
02:05:03.451 --> 02:05:06.480
Gaga is was asked from the grammys and listen to me,
Mr. Levine,

2182
02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:09.990
if you're concentrating on her saying you're doing it wrong,
okay,

2183
02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:14.280
what you should be concentrating on is the fact that her and Miley Cyrus had an

2184
02:05:14.281 --> 02:05:19.020
old school south park sloughed off on the video music awards and Lady Gaga

2185
02:05:19.021 --> 02:05:19.854
dominated her.

2186
02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:25.040
She dominated her without any of the tongue sticking out without any stupid shit

2187
02:05:25.141 --> 02:05:30.141
with the foam finger just with this tremendous body she has suspicious yet.

2188
02:05:31.890 --> 02:05:36.390
Pull that shut up.
Look at this dude.
Come on with your bad self.
Look at her ass.

2189
02:05:36.391 --> 02:05:39.240
Give us a full photo.
What do you see the,
there's some great pictures.

2190
02:05:39.241 --> 02:05:44.100
We see the whole body.
Her whole,
her body's in tremendous shape.
Man,

2191
02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:50.940
that is a great app.
My God,
dude,
her body's in some breathe through it.

2192
02:05:50.970 --> 02:05:53.420
She wins.
Her body wins.
That's when a breathe.

2193
02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:56.010
Why are you talking about her singing?
If you don't like it,
don't like it,

2194
02:05:56.011 --> 02:05:58.740
but what?
You know,
why would you complain about that?
You know,

2195
02:05:58.741 --> 02:06:03.741
I guess it was like some music video she did that showed various art styles or

2196
02:06:03.841 --> 02:06:06.510
something.
I Dunno what the fuck it was all about.
Who Cares?

2197
02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:10.620
Look at her ass and that's the con,
the comparison.
Mature.
That is hilarious.

2198
02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:14.580
It's rude.
When I was hired,
I was talking about on stage,

2199
02:06:14.581 --> 02:06:19.500
she got fuck you money and she just,
that's a fucking thing.
That's all that was.

2200
02:06:19.501 --> 02:06:22.920
That whole thing was,
she probably just threw it together.
She's young,
you know,

2201
02:06:22.921 --> 02:06:26.400
you shouldn't be that famous when you're that young.
You're 20 years old.

2202
02:06:26.401 --> 02:06:28.860
He's trying to find yourself and you're doing it on television like that and

2203
02:06:28.861 --> 02:06:32.220
someone allows you to put that together and do that on television.

2204
02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:36.060
Or maybe she likes it.
Who knows?
Maybe when you're 20 that's cool.
I love,

2205
02:06:36.061 --> 02:06:37.830
fuck you mom.
I love her big dumb teeth.

2206
02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:40.620
You remember when there's things that you liked when you were young?
You know,

2207
02:06:40.621 --> 02:06:42.810
there was certain comic books she's like,
look forward to,

2208
02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:45.570
and if you had to read them today,
he'd be like,
what is this piece of shit?

2209
02:06:46.410 --> 02:06:48.780
The fact that he loved him.
Maybe that's what it's like for her.

2210
02:06:48.781 --> 02:06:51.390
She's 20 years old,
right?
Which she thinks is awesome.

2211
02:06:51.420 --> 02:06:55.350
It might be that 100% she might like watch that every night and go,

2212
02:06:55.351 --> 02:06:59.310
I fucking knocked it out of the park.
I was watching Ghostbusters the other day.

2213
02:06:59.311 --> 02:07:02.250
It's still a great movie.
But I remember when I was a kid watching it,

2214
02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:05.850
how my mind was blown at how funny that movie was.

2215
02:07:06.090 --> 02:07:07.620
Well that's a different time though.

2216
02:07:07.650 --> 02:07:12.600
There's a thing about comedy that comedy has a very short sort of lifetime to it

2217
02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:17.220
and then if you go back and try to watch some comedies from a long time ago,

2218
02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:22.320
a lot of them don't hold up at all.
You could see like even blazing saddles.

2219
02:07:22.340 --> 02:07:24.300
It's a great fucking movie.

2220
02:07:24.690 --> 02:07:27.240
You go back and watch it today and compare it to something like,

2221
02:07:27.420 --> 02:07:29.370
did you see the world's end?
Yes.

2222
02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:33.420
Fucking whole Larry an awesome movie.

2223
02:07:33.450 --> 02:07:36.100
It was a great movie.
Here's my thing about the worlds.
Then I

2224
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:37.060
<v 2>think that put the end,</v>

2225
02:07:37.061 --> 02:07:42.061
the whole rape joke controversy because they do a five minute bit in there about

2226
02:07:43.210 --> 02:07:47.680
rape joke and nobody say anything.
So I'm like,
okay,
that's cool.
It was hilarious.

2227
02:07:47.681 --> 02:07:50.730
It was five minutes.
I'm whether where,
where?
Oh,

2228
02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:54.610
is that the one with the bar or is that the one where,
uh,
with Seth Rogen,
Oh,

2229
02:07:54.611 --> 02:07:56.980
I thought you were talking about the one would send the row against Jesus
Christ.

2230
02:07:57.170 --> 02:07:59.190
What did you see?
That one?
What was the,

2231
02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:03.350
this is the enzyme that was hilariously different movies and I let go.

2232
02:08:03.370 --> 02:08:06.310
I love that one.
I saw the world very funny.

2233
02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:10.100
The world's ended the robots in the pub.
I haven't seen it.
I'll go wash.
Look,

2234
02:08:10.610 --> 02:08:15.100
I'll come back with a book report on em.
Well,
those guys are funny,

2235
02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:20.680
dumb and dumber.
That doing a reunion.
Yeah.
That's not necessary.

2236
02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:24.820
That's a mistake at the Emmy's.

2237
02:08:24.820 --> 02:08:29.630
He beat out a breaking bad.
Who did?
Uh,
Jeff Daniels,

2238
02:08:30.100 --> 02:08:33.490
his character on newsroom newsroom.
Oh,
that's right.
He,
that's the same guy.

2239
02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:35.680
It's hard to remember that.
That's the same guy.

2240
02:08:35.681 --> 02:08:37.330
When you see in there with this silly look at his face.

2241
02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:39.310
I don't want to watch this.
Who knows though.

2242
02:08:39.370 --> 02:08:42.490
It was it the fairly brothers still probably,
yeah.
We have to look up.

2243
02:08:42.491 --> 02:08:45.640
Don't probably means it's a fucking computer in front of you.
Google at Sun.

2244
02:08:45.641 --> 02:08:50.260
Pretty sure it is.
Probably in 2015 yes it is.
Well,
if it's a fairly brothers,

2245
02:08:50.261 --> 02:08:53.050
that makes sense because they know what the fuck they're doing.

2246
02:08:53.230 --> 02:08:54.940
That's their movie.
Maybe they can do it again.

2247
02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:56.440
They're supposed to put out the movie,

2248
02:08:56.441 --> 02:08:58.870
but then that magician movie didn't do that well,

2249
02:08:58.871 --> 02:09:02.650
so they pulled funding on it even though the magician movie was hilarious.

2250
02:09:02.770 --> 02:09:05.490
I heard that Burt Wonderstone.
It's hilarious.
Hilarious too.

2251
02:09:05.590 --> 02:09:08.770
It's really fucking funny.
I watched it on the flight,

2252
02:09:08.771 --> 02:09:11.590
the international flight where they give you like 90 movies to watch and I was

2253
02:09:11.591 --> 02:09:15.460
one of it and I'm like,
this is really funny.
Why didn't it go?
What happened?

2254
02:09:15.730 --> 02:09:20.050
I did a dude,
who knows?
I don't know how they market it.
I don't know man.

2255
02:09:20.380 --> 02:09:24.010
What's his face?
Steve Carell's a great,
great comedic actor.

2256
02:09:24.011 --> 02:09:27.970
I don't know how well some of his movies do,
but he's a great actor.
Yeah.

2257
02:09:27.971 --> 02:09:29.440
That movie,
for whatever reason,

2258
02:09:29.441 --> 02:09:32.410
just didn't seem appealing when it was out and the movie theaters to me there,

2259
02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:36.640
I thought it was the way it was marketed or something.
Maybe.
I don't know man,

2260
02:09:36.641 --> 02:09:40.660
but it was,
and let me tell you,
Jim Carrey murders in that.

2261
02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:45.190
He's so good in that movie.
Is he the magician?
He's like the bad guy.

2262
02:09:45.190 --> 02:09:49.540
Magician in it.
Oh,
all right.
I need to go see that.
It was great,
man.

2263
02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:52.690
It was a great movie.
I watched it on a plane,
but I didn't watch all of it,

2264
02:09:52.691 --> 02:09:56.380
but I was howling.
It was quick solve it though,
and he was great.

2265
02:09:56.381 --> 02:10:00.250
Hi Jim Carrey was great in a in a kickass too.

2266
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.900
I love kick ass.

2267
02:10:01.930 --> 02:10:05.230
Kick ass one was one of the best movies I've ever watched in terms of comedy

2268
02:10:05.231 --> 02:10:09.160
cast too.
It's good.
It's good.
It's it.
Number one is a little better,

2269
02:10:09.161 --> 02:10:12.940
but that's hard to beat it because it's such a great movie.
Yeah,

2270
02:10:13.390 --> 02:10:16.870
but that little girl in that movie is so smart.
There's some of these,

2271
02:10:17.230 --> 02:10:21.400
these child actors,
she like,
man,
how do they graph that kind of motion?

2272
02:10:21.550 --> 02:10:23.140
Cause they're brilliant.
They're like,

2273
02:10:23.260 --> 02:10:26.530
they all go on like Harvard and Yale to school and stuff like that.

2274
02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:29.440
Cause they're way smarter than the average kid at that age.

2275
02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:31.180
I don't think it's hard to act,
man.

2276
02:10:31.210 --> 02:10:33.920
I think there's a lot of kids out there that can do.
I honestly do.

2277
02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.110
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2278
02:10:34.110 --> 02:10:37.490
But I think there's some kids you see that they're just playing a kid and then

2279
02:10:37.491 --> 02:10:40.250
you see there's some who like have the moment.

2280
02:10:40.251 --> 02:10:42.590
That girl who's also in let me in.

2281
02:10:43.190 --> 02:10:46.280
She's incredible.
Yeah,
she's really good.

2282
02:10:46.281 --> 02:10:49.370
But I don't think that it's that hard to do.
I okay,
I'll give you that.

2283
02:10:49.371 --> 02:10:52.970
I did a movie this year and it was like,
I'm like,
Oh shit.
Done this before.

2284
02:10:52.971 --> 02:10:54.470
But it's like,
yeah,
but this,

2285
02:10:54.590 --> 02:10:59.510
some of these kids are just able to just nail this very adult motion.

2286
02:10:59.630 --> 02:11:01.220
Yeah,
no,
they definitely are.

2287
02:11:01.221 --> 02:11:03.860
Especially if it's really well written and they're really smart.

2288
02:11:03.890 --> 02:11:08.210
I met a Dakota fanning's at her name.
Really young girl ones.
Very,
very smart kid.

2289
02:11:08.330 --> 02:11:12.770
Very smart cheese.
A another one.
There was a brilliant young actress,

2290
02:11:12.771 --> 02:11:17.720
but I always get weirded out by the idea because I like Miley Cyrus.

2291
02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:20.480
I think everybody should be able to do whatever the fuck they want to do.

2292
02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:23.210
However,
are you sure that's what you want?

2293
02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:27.260
And then you show you're ready to handle the repercussions of that because being

2294
02:11:27.261 --> 02:11:32.180
a Miley Cyrus has gotta be mindbogglingly difficult to not go crazy.

2295
02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:36.620
If you look at all of them,
everyone who ever was a young superstar,

2296
02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:40.940
how many of them made it through Ron Howard,
Jodie Foster,

2297
02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:45.680
and who knows?
Who knows how crazy they really are?
They seem awesome.
I mean,

2298
02:11:45.681 --> 02:11:48.350
Ron Howard seems totally together,
so it was Jodie Foster,

2299
02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:53.010
but think about how many of them went loco.
Almost all the rest.
Really.

2300
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:55.520
I know a couple.
I know him personally.

2301
02:11:55.521 --> 02:11:58.490
I know a couple of them that were famous when they're young and they're fucking

2302
02:11:58.491 --> 02:12:02.360
crazy man.
It all wired wrong.

2303
02:12:02.630 --> 02:12:06.440
Just like moving around and working,
but you're like,
oh,
this is where that is,

2304
02:12:06.441 --> 02:12:08.300
and that's where this is and how'd you get wired?

2305
02:12:08.301 --> 02:12:11.990
But that all you've been famous since you were five,
so that never even grew.

2306
02:12:12.170 --> 02:12:16.550
Oh Wow.
That's that Justin Bieber situation,
you know?
It's like,

2307
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:20.600
just seems like he's got everything and I mean his dad's his manager,

2308
02:12:20.601 --> 02:12:21.960
but what can his dad tell him?

2309
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:24.530
I don't think when you could have outside influences,

2310
02:12:24.650 --> 02:12:27.980
that's when things start going real really crazy.
Yeah.

2311
02:12:27.981 --> 02:12:29.330
There's no doubt about that.

2312
02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:34.360
There's no doubt that if you are a regular human being like we all are and you

2313
02:12:34.881 --> 02:12:38.480
don't slowly get inoculated to the idea of fame,

2314
02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:42.620
you don't develop some character,
you don't get older,
you don't get wiser.

2315
02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:45.650
You just jump into it from the time you're a baby.

2316
02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:49.910
Your reality is going to be so much different than everyone else's.

2317
02:12:50.090 --> 02:12:54.350
It's going to be wild animal.
That's what you are.
You become like a wild animal.

2318
02:12:54.351 --> 02:12:57.590
You're not taught the proper way to act.

2319
02:12:57.591 --> 02:13:01.310
You're not trained in the proper way of being in society,

2320
02:13:01.311 --> 02:13:04.610
so you're just reacting however you want to react.
Well,
I don't know about that,

2321
02:13:04.611 --> 02:13:07.160
but you don't develop character and a normal person does.

2322
02:13:07.370 --> 02:13:10.660
Being accepted or rejected,
learning how to coach people,

2323
02:13:10.700 --> 02:13:13.160
how you treat people or you're going to be famous from the jump.

2324
02:13:13.190 --> 02:13:18.140
And that just that alone,
having that royalty thing being so much more.

2325
02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:19.780
Look at Michael Jackson and look at,
you know,

2326
02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:24.080
how many of them had to become that way?
Donny Osmond,
I'd be the most normal.

2327
02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:29.040
Yeah,
but cause he's still at his family.
I mean Mormonism.
Yeah,
keep it together.

2328
02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:32.070
Had a bunch of people.
But then it's like just had some crazy

2329
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:34.890
<v 1>kids come out.
But even think about Michael Jackson.</v>

2330
02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:38.820
I mean that fame is beyond anything anyone will ever get to.
I mean,

2331
02:13:38.821 --> 02:13:41.820
he was the big thing plan.
He couldn't leave his house.

2332
02:13:42.060 --> 02:13:44.860
So every day's like probably looking at himself in the mirror and just imagine

2333
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:47.220
if you looked at yourself in the mirror all day,
every day.

2334
02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:49.980
It just like you'd start nitpicking herself.
Yeah.

2335
02:13:49.981 --> 02:13:51.510
You would start fucking with yourself.

2336
02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:54.910
Especially if you started changing things about your face.
Oh yeah.
No,

2337
02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:59.190
bleaching your skin.
Just wanting to get your lips thinner.
Yeah,

2338
02:13:59.191 --> 02:14:02.520
he did a lot of weird shit,
man.
I don't,
I wonder what he really did.

2339
02:14:02.820 --> 02:14:06.930
I wonder if ever we'll find out what were the full extent of the surgeries.

2340
02:14:06.931 --> 02:14:11.790
But he's the first guy in the history of television,
film.

2341
02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:16.440
Everything that we watched become like a freak like went from,

2342
02:14:16.650 --> 02:14:17.850
and I don't mean freaking a good way,

2343
02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:23.120
went from being this young boy who's this brilliant talent to being this man who

2344
02:14:23.641 --> 02:14:28.080
like hides and wants to be with children and has an amusement park and he's
Pale.

2345
02:14:28.230 --> 02:14:31.620
He's a white guy for no reason is knows as skinny.
His lips are skinny.

2346
02:14:31.940 --> 02:14:34.740
I mean his face changed so radically.

2347
02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:39.570
It might be the first guy that we've ever seen that has,
has done that.

2348
02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:43.740
The first person that we've ever seen that's grown from childhood to adult and

2349
02:14:43.741 --> 02:14:45.780
become like this kind of crazy freak like that.

2350
02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:48.780
And everywhere you go there's cameras.
You can't go anywhere,

2351
02:14:48.781 --> 02:14:50.850
you can't do anything.
It would just,

2352
02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.260
I mean that's just too much fame at the comparisons of his face when he first

2353
02:14:55.261 --> 02:15:00.060
started and then what he became over the years and what,

2354
02:15:00.061 --> 02:15:04.260
what do you,
what he looked like before he died.
It's really,
really shocking.

2355
02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:07.200
First of all,
who the fuck are these plastic surgeons?

2356
02:15:07.410 --> 02:15:09.450
How come nobody knows who these people are?

2357
02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:13.140
Like we know who the guy is who gave him the drugs that made him die,

2358
02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:15.030
but nobody knows who did all that work on him.

2359
02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:19.150
Like that guy did a terrible disservice.
Yes.

2360
02:15:19.710 --> 02:15:22.350
Like what did you do?
Like that guy,

2361
02:15:22.530 --> 02:15:26.310
that dude needed a hug and defend his lips out.
Well,
no,

2362
02:15:26.370 --> 02:15:29.610
you gave him so many no's operations.
It is,
knows caved in.

2363
02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:32.790
Like what can I doctor says yes to that one.
Who wants money?

2364
02:15:32.791 --> 02:15:36.630
I'm sure they just wanted the throat.
Immense amount of cash at.
Um,

2365
02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:40.290
do you have any photos?
See if you pull any photos of like the before and after.

2366
02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:44.160
That's okay.
It's just,
um,
it's madness.

2367
02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:48.750
What he's done to his body,
what he did to his face,

2368
02:15:48.751 --> 02:15:52.230
his eyes look at the size of his eyes when it was all over.

2369
02:15:53.220 --> 02:15:58.000
So strange.
It's so strange.

2370
02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:02.430
Yeah.
I made himself look white.
Well he,

2371
02:16:02.550 --> 02:16:05.340
he just did a lot of crazy shit to his nose.

2372
02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:09.540
His nose was so bad that they had to like graph skin over it.
It caved in.

2373
02:16:09.810 --> 02:16:13.980
It lost its support.
Started getting necrosis on his nose apparently too.

2374
02:16:14.250 --> 02:16:17.660
Isn't that what the one girl from the hill she did Heidi montage.

2375
02:16:17.661 --> 02:16:21.990
She did so much plastic surgery or nose was falling off.
I don't know.
Is that,

2376
02:16:21.991 --> 02:16:25.770
that's bullshit dude.
That's not real.
Uh,
I don't know.
I don't know.
Is that true?

2377
02:16:25.870 --> 02:16:27.960
That's sad shit man.
It's sad shit.

2378
02:16:27.961 --> 02:16:30.150
When you Pete see people start shoot and things.

2379
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:34.080
You're shaving their face is hot and their nose down.
That lady,
that one one,

2380
02:16:34.090 --> 02:16:35.560
we got so much plus surgery.

2381
02:16:35.561 --> 02:16:37.900
She looks like a cat and that's what starts happening.
Yeah.

2382
02:16:37.901 --> 02:16:40.390
I think she started fixing that.
Let's see.
Let me see.

2383
02:16:40.450 --> 02:16:44.050
I think there was like something about cat lady fixing our face.
Cat Lady.

2384
02:16:44.051 --> 02:16:45.910
Fix your fuck and face.

2385
02:16:46.090 --> 02:16:50.050
But there's a lot of ladies that I see like in Beverly Hills that looked like

2386
02:16:50.051 --> 02:16:50.884
monsters.

2387
02:16:51.500 --> 02:16:51.830
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2388
02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:55.710
<v 1>Yeah.
The Duck Lips.
It just like,
it's a hoot.
Who's,
who said that?</v>

2389
02:16:55.711 --> 02:16:57.080
Sexy Duck Lips.

2390
02:16:58.220 --> 02:16:58.650
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2391
02:16:58.650 --> 02:16:59.940
<v 1>Yeah.
She's trying to fix it.</v>

2392
02:16:59.970 --> 02:17:02.460
She's making him while she was so pretty and the beginning,
man,

2393
02:17:02.461 --> 02:17:06.720
that's really sad.
I just,
when you have that much money and you just get bored,

2394
02:17:07.710 --> 02:17:07.930
<v 0>okay.</v>

2395
02:17:07.930 --> 02:17:10.300
<v 1>Yeah.
Okay.
We'll get the actually so pretty.</v>

2396
02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:12.053
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2397
02:17:12.130 --> 02:17:12.461
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2398
02:17:12.461 --> 02:17:17.461
And then you just start injecting this and shaving that and why I also think

2399
02:17:18.371 --> 02:17:21.230
that the human mind is there's,

2400
02:17:21.340 --> 02:17:26.340
it's very possible for people to go crazy given the wrong circumstances,

2401
02:17:26.801 --> 02:17:30.850
giving the wrong,
you know,
wrong motivations.

2402
02:17:31.090 --> 02:17:35.230
The wrong people in their life.
People can blow fuses,

2403
02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:40.500
they can blast screws out and Dick can go nutty and they might not even realize

2404
02:17:40.721 --> 02:17:43.000
what they're doing while they're doing it.
Like,

2405
02:17:43.001 --> 02:17:47.530
did you see that lady that the uh,
the lady that um,
wow.

2406
02:17:47.531 --> 02:17:51.310
Is that really what she looked like?
She loves hot.
No.
Is that real?

2407
02:17:52.030 --> 02:17:53.620
Wow.
That's so crazy.

2408
02:17:53.621 --> 02:17:56.290
There's a before and after of the Cat lady where she was so funny.

2409
02:17:56.350 --> 02:17:58.240
No matter how much place surgery you get,

2410
02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:02.740
you can never remove the experience of life from your eyes.

2411
02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:05.980
You can always tell him the eyes,
how much stuff you've seen,

2412
02:18:05.981 --> 02:18:08.890
how much stuff you've been through.
It's always in the eyes.

2413
02:18:09.250 --> 02:18:12.640
He can't shave that off.
You can never get rid of the crazy either.
Right.
The,

2414
02:18:12.940 --> 02:18:17.440
you can't unsee what you've seen when the crazies in the eyes.
You see that shit

2415
02:18:19.790 --> 02:18:22.460
crazy.
Fucking people are everywhere too.

2416
02:18:22.730 --> 02:18:25.910
There's a woman in Korea that got addicted to plastic surgery,

2417
02:18:25.911 --> 02:18:30.170
so she didn't started injecting cooking oil into,
oh my God.
Did you see that?
No,

2418
02:18:30.171 --> 02:18:32.030
I don't want to say that.
You don't want to see it.
It's,

2419
02:18:32.031 --> 02:18:36.170
it's sad though and she was a really pretty young girl and she just,

2420
02:18:37.010 --> 02:18:39.800
apparently it's just like Anorexia,

2421
02:18:39.801 --> 02:18:42.380
just like bodybuilders that don't know how big they are.

2422
02:18:42.770 --> 02:18:44.420
There's we're susceptible.

2423
02:18:44.421 --> 02:18:48.000
We're susceptible to all sorts of weird variations in human behavior.
Yeah.

2424
02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:52.550
Addictions and were susceptible to going down these weird delusional path where

2425
02:18:52.551 --> 02:18:56.330
we don't see ourselves for what we look like.
Yeah.
We really calm with that.

2426
02:18:56.331 --> 02:18:58.940
With my fatness.
You,
what do you see how you see yourself?

2427
02:18:58.970 --> 02:19:02.300
I see myself as a sexy base.
Are you just a rock?

2428
02:19:03.410 --> 02:19:07.690
You like bulky at all?
I don't know what it is about my home mirror,
but it lets,

2429
02:19:07.820 --> 02:19:10.820
it makes me feel a lot better than this shot does.
Well,

2430
02:19:10.821 --> 02:19:14.600
look how you're sitting though.
It's bad.
Last year,
what do you want me to go?

2431
02:19:14.601 --> 02:19:17.870
Prop.
What do you want me to go but up.
That's it.
That's not bad right there.
Look,

2432
02:19:17.871 --> 02:19:20.060
how are you sitting?
Look predetermined.
I liked everywhere,

2433
02:19:20.061 --> 02:19:23.000
but here this is just it and I got to start working that I do.

2434
02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:26.570
You don't work out at all?
I do.
I just run.
But I got to do more.

2435
02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:29.780
Get to lift weights.
I got to get over the pink and blue weights.

2436
02:19:29.781 --> 02:19:33.890
I got to get to the Manuela and rob.
Black metal.
The raw.
Yeah,
the metal.

2437
02:19:33.891 --> 02:19:37.110
The blacks.
I to get over that it,
those pink weights aren't help.

2438
02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:41.090
How old are you now,
Sam?
Uh,
I'm 40 you got to do it before it's too late.

2439
02:19:41.630 --> 02:19:44.720
While your body is still pumping good fluid.
It's slowing down.

2440
02:19:44.780 --> 02:19:47.210
You got to get some sludge in your vein,
son.
I got to keep moving.

2441
02:19:47.211 --> 02:19:50.960
You can't because it's harder to do it when you're 40 than it is when you 39 and

2442
02:19:50.961 --> 02:19:54.310
harder when you 41 then is when you're 14 I know,
dude.
I know baby.

2443
02:19:54.330 --> 02:19:58.460
Can you pick a voice inside my head?
I am.
I'm trying to be please.
I need it.

2444
02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:01.190
You don't want me in there.
I'll make a recording for you.
I'll drive you crazy.

2445
02:20:01.191 --> 02:20:04.820
You throw that shit out of your head with a first day.
No,

2446
02:20:04.850 --> 02:20:07.610
my left foot was just skip and play over and over again.

2447
02:20:07.640 --> 02:20:10.700
Do you think that that would be like a good products of so me telling people

2448
02:20:10.701 --> 02:20:14.210
what to do like listen,
you can fucking do this like fear factor style.

2449
02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:18.590
I completely green and sell the fuck out of my fucking ass.

2450
02:20:18.970 --> 02:20:21.290
I'll personalize it to your name.
Sam Aaa.

2451
02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:24.920
Today's the day you are the hero in the movie of your own life.

2452
02:20:25.010 --> 02:20:26.330
It's time to get shit.

2453
02:20:26.410 --> 02:20:30.020
Pompez somewhat motivational speakers that do they just sell you tapes and just

2454
02:20:30.021 --> 02:20:31.820
tell me your name though.
I believe in yourself.

2455
02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:34.590
The way to do it right as it use the guy's name to make a,
a,

2456
02:20:34.970 --> 02:20:38.060
a real personal one and use her name if you really needed it.

2457
02:20:38.090 --> 02:20:39.860
Most people don't need it.
Most people are like,
bitch,

2458
02:20:39.861 --> 02:20:42.290
I don't need to hear you telling me what to do.
I'm with you man.

2459
02:20:42.410 --> 02:20:45.140
I think a lot of people would love it.
A lot of people need it.

2460
02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:49.550
You don't know how.
You obviously know how far this show reaches.
People live,

2461
02:20:49.551 --> 02:20:53.780
breathe and die.
This shit.
I did morning news in San Diego,

2462
02:20:54.300 --> 02:20:56.330
the wounds,
I wasn't even on the show.
She's like,

2463
02:20:56.331 --> 02:20:59.480
I heard your name on the Joe Rogan show,
hot chick out of San Diego.

2464
02:20:59.481 --> 02:21:02.600
You think you have a shot with her?
I could have if I want to keep pushing it,

2465
02:21:02.601 --> 02:21:04.640
but they
pay me.

2466
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:09.560
Pay me doing radio from six in the morning until three in the afternoon.

2467
02:21:09.620 --> 02:21:14.510
Oh my God.
I was on tour,
uh,
comedy,
mad house down in,

2468
02:21:14.511 --> 02:21:16.520
uh,
why would they put you on so much?

2469
02:21:16.730 --> 02:21:19.880
Because they just wanted me to push product.
Jesus Christ son,

2470
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:23.690
just let me know and I'll tweet it for you.
That's ridiculous.

2471
02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:26.410
Tell him don't do that.
Yeah,
well you know,
I like doing it.

2472
02:21:26.430 --> 02:21:28.670
I like going in there and see if I could rock it,
but man,

2473
02:21:28.671 --> 02:21:31.090
that was longer than it's ever been.
It's good to rocket,

2474
02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:35.000
but you also need to get some sleep before the show effected my show.
Oh,

2475
02:21:35.001 --> 02:21:37.160
it does my first shot.
It's just like my,

2476
02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:39.950
my energy is just really whacked right now.

2477
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:42.470
Well especially because most comedians,
and it's not an excuse,

2478
02:21:42.471 --> 02:21:45.260
but the reality is we have a certain sleep cycle.

2479
02:21:45.410 --> 02:21:48.710
We go to bed at like two three four you know,
even later in the morning,

2480
02:21:48.860 --> 02:21:50.780
like people have said to me like,
Oh,
you're up pretty late.

2481
02:21:50.781 --> 02:21:53.360
Last night I saw your tweet and around two of the Ama like,
bitch,

2482
02:21:53.361 --> 02:21:55.140
I just started writing it too.
Right.

2483
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:59.180
I went to bed at eight which I'll usually go to bed.
What time?

2484
02:21:59.210 --> 02:22:02.420
I go to bed in the morning.
Really?
Yeah,
like,
like what?

2485
02:22:02.421 --> 02:22:05.990
Like six my kids go to bed really early.

2486
02:22:06.140 --> 02:22:07.520
They go to bed at like seven ish,

2487
02:22:07.521 --> 02:22:10.800
seven 30 I read them stories by seven 30 there conked out.

2488
02:22:10.850 --> 02:22:12.410
Like they've got to get up in the morning and go to school.

2489
02:22:13.460 --> 02:22:16.820
I can't write until the house is quiet.
You can't trust me.

2490
02:22:16.821 --> 02:22:19.830
You cannot write Dick Jokes while he got little girls screaming.

2491
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:24.590
Understand playing team Umizoomi and run around your house.
Like they,
they,

2492
02:22:24.591 --> 02:22:27.870
you know,
and you also have to pay attention to them while they're awake,

2493
02:22:28.220 --> 02:22:29.220
you know,
while they're home.

2494
02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:32.670
That's when we have fun together and when it's all done and everyone's asleep,

2495
02:22:32.850 --> 02:22:35.310
then I can get into my shed.
He goes to work,

2496
02:22:35.370 --> 02:22:39.090
daddy goes to work and sometimes it lasts a long time.
Like if I catch a wave,

2497
02:22:39.330 --> 02:22:40.480
like if I'm in the on roll,

2498
02:22:40.610 --> 02:22:43.950
like especially if I'm writing a blog or like lately I've been,

2499
02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:48.270
I've been writing a novel,
actually it started writing enough a few weeks ago.

2500
02:22:48.271 --> 02:22:52.050
I've been obsessed with this.
But you put out so much content.

2501
02:22:52.810 --> 02:22:54.900
I got a lot of shit.
My head man trying to get over my childhood.

2502
02:22:56.190 --> 02:23:00.000
And that child childhood made you who you are.
Yeah,
absolutely.
You know,

2503
02:23:00.090 --> 02:23:03.030
everybody has to have a shitty childhood.
Makes you awesome.
Hey man,

2504
02:23:03.031 --> 02:23:06.240
if it was handed to you,
you'd be lazy.
Yeah,
there's a little of that too.

2505
02:23:06.241 --> 02:23:10.440
But also,
um,
I enjoy the creative process.

2506
02:23:10.470 --> 02:23:13.590
I really enjoy it.
The only thing that keeps me for doing it,
it's distractions.

2507
02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:18.820
Whether it's playing pool or doing Jujitsu or other things in my life,
if,

2508
02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:20.460
or watching TV or something like that.

2509
02:23:20.461 --> 02:23:23.190
Those are the only distractions that actually keep me from creating things.

2510
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:26.640
I'm at my happiest,
not at my happiest,

2511
02:23:26.641 --> 02:23:30.090
but I think a good source of happiness I should say,

2512
02:23:30.091 --> 02:23:32.790
I want to quantify it is when something comes out.

2513
02:23:32.791 --> 02:23:35.490
When I sit down and write something and it comes out,
I love it.

2514
02:23:35.730 --> 02:23:40.730
That's why I never understood joke stealing it because I love so much coming up

2515
02:23:41.761 --> 02:23:42.750
with an idea,

2516
02:23:43.230 --> 02:23:47.880
fine tuning it and presenting it to people and the reaction to it,

2517
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:52.020
I enjoy,
you know,
it's like I could do just Crowdwork.

2518
02:23:52.110 --> 02:23:55.970
I could just rack the crowd for an hour,
just go every,

2519
02:23:56.010 --> 02:24:00.120
do an interview final who they are 'em and they'd be happy,

2520
02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:01.320
but that doesn't get me off.

2521
02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:05.940
What gets me off as coming up with an idea in my head,
fine tuning it,
tagging it,

2522
02:24:06.180 --> 02:24:10.620
and then presenting it to a crowd and getting a reaction from 300 strangers or

2523
02:24:10.621 --> 02:24:14.580
who I'm at.
How many people are in the crawl.
That is what an artist is.

2524
02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:17.340
That's why the guy saying he's not an artist.
It's so fucking silly.

2525
02:24:17.610 --> 02:24:21.120
You put together a song,
you're an artist,
shut your hole.
All right,
stop it.

2526
02:24:21.570 --> 02:24:22.650
And when you're an artist,

2527
02:24:22.651 --> 02:24:24.990
you get that satisfaction of someone appreciating your art.

2528
02:24:25.410 --> 02:24:27.390
That's what it is to make something good.

2529
02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:30.870
They appreciate your art and that's what these people are doing.

2530
02:24:30.871 --> 02:24:32.510
They're appreciating your art.
You,
you,

2531
02:24:32.511 --> 02:24:35.670
you put something together and the reward is when it comes out,
right?

2532
02:24:35.671 --> 02:24:39.420
You get a big laugh in the crowd.
Ah,
it's awesome.

2533
02:24:39.900 --> 02:24:41.430
I love it when I hear,
you know,

2534
02:24:41.431 --> 02:24:44.250
I'll go on the road and I'll meet some people are fans of the podcast and

2535
02:24:44.610 --> 02:24:46.950
they're in the middle of nowhere and they're doing their own podcasts.

2536
02:24:46.950 --> 02:24:48.210
And I love that they're like,

2537
02:24:48.211 --> 02:24:51.360
they're finding their own creative ways to put their things out that isn't

2538
02:24:51.361 --> 02:24:51.961
necessarily like,

2539
02:24:51.961 --> 02:24:55.170
Hey I got to get this podcast out cause I need to have this result,

2540
02:24:55.171 --> 02:24:58.080
which would lead to this.
And they just love the creativity.

2541
02:24:58.081 --> 02:25:00.210
I always think that's so cool man.

2542
02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:04.020
Just to be doing your own thing like allowed to death squad.
People in Ohio,

2543
02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:08.220
they have this whole desk squad network and a bunch of them do podcasts and I

2544
02:25:08.221 --> 02:25:09.600
think it's really cool,
man.

2545
02:25:09.660 --> 02:25:11.760
The Internet is filled with people that have their own podcast.

2546
02:25:11.761 --> 02:25:15.930
I get requests listened to them every day.
Someone says,
Hey,
check out my podcast.

2547
02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:18.120
Look if you do something it's good.

2548
02:25:18.121 --> 02:25:21.110
People will listen and then they'll tell people and so on and so on and it'll

2549
02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:22.320
grow.
And it's really that easy.

2550
02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:24.820
I mean I know I had a head start because I was already on television.

2551
02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:27.130
I did a bunch of other things before I started doing my podcast,

2552
02:25:27.131 --> 02:25:28.870
but it all just grew.

2553
02:25:28.871 --> 02:25:32.030
The first couple episodes is like a hundred people listened to it,
you know,

2554
02:25:32.031 --> 02:25:34.090
and nobody gives a shit.
It took,
it takes awhile.

2555
02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:36.370
I remember you talking about doing your podcast.

2556
02:25:36.371 --> 02:25:39.130
I think you'd just done Adam Carolla show,
right?
And you're like,
hey man,

2557
02:25:39.131 --> 02:25:42.160
I might try to do that.
Well,
we actually did it long before then,

2558
02:25:42.161 --> 02:25:46.260
but we never stuck with it.
We did it on Justin TV.
Yeah,
we used to do it,
uh,

2559
02:25:46.270 --> 02:25:49.420
after shows.
We used to do with this before anybody was doing podcasts.

2560
02:25:49.421 --> 02:25:52.120
We were doing these live streaming things from the green room.

2561
02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:55.030
We're going to answer questions.
They look a little chat room.

2562
02:25:55.031 --> 02:25:59.410
We would just talk shit for the Green Room.
It was fun.
And then one day,
um,

2563
02:25:59.710 --> 02:26:04.360
there was two people that inspired me,
Adam Carolla and also opie and Anthony.

2564
02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:09.360
Anthony [inaudible] has a place set up at his house and he has a green screen

2565
02:26:09.521 --> 02:26:11.780
and a tricorder and the whole thing.
I mean,

2566
02:26:11.781 --> 02:26:14.820
he tri caster and he has this incredible setup.

2567
02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:17.380
We can pretend he's in Manhattan with the city behind him.

2568
02:26:17.530 --> 02:26:19.000
He can make it like Africa.

2569
02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:22.510
He could make it like space that you can do whatever he wants and it's pretty

2570
02:26:22.511 --> 02:26:26.110
fucking dope.
And I saw that.
I was like,
damn,
it would be fun to do.

2571
02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:30.910
And so we started doing them on Ustream just,
you know,
three,

2572
02:26:30.911 --> 02:26:34.210
almost four years ago before years ago,
I think.
I think it's four years,

2573
02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:37.600
something like that.
Four years ago in December.
It's a long ass time.

2574
02:26:37.630 --> 02:26:41.470
Have you ever thought about putting in a green screen?
Yeah.
Too much work.

2575
02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:43.090
And now who gives a fuck?
You know,

2576
02:26:43.091 --> 02:26:46.420
it's distracting to have a bunch of shit going on,
but this place is gorgeous.

2577
02:26:46.420 --> 02:26:48.910
It's one more thing to think about too.
I don't want to think about shit.

2578
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:53.940
It's gorgeous.
Gorgeous.
Like a girl.
I'm fucking,
you want to fuck my house?

2579
02:26:53.941 --> 02:26:58.180
Yeah,
I'll fuck you in your studio.
Yeah,
well we know what it is.
It's like,

2580
02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:02.660
it's what you can do if you can just design it from the ground up by herself.

2581
02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:04.090
I don't want a brick wall.
A brick wall.

2582
02:27:04.091 --> 02:27:06.430
I don't want to say what made that a old oak boom.

2583
02:27:06.431 --> 02:27:09.880
That's not the natural wall there.
You just know it in the wall that built,

2584
02:27:10.090 --> 02:27:12.430
you had someone build a wall.
Yeah.
Build a brick wall.

2585
02:27:12.470 --> 02:27:14.200
You know all around through the whole building.

2586
02:27:14.300 --> 02:27:16.750
You use just like being in front of brick walls,
like comedy clubs.

2587
02:27:16.970 --> 02:27:18.210
It feels organic though.

2588
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:20.740
That's why I wanted this wooden table to the wooden table.

2589
02:27:20.741 --> 02:27:24.100
Feels like you feel it.
You know?
This is like this got a life to it.

2590
02:27:24.101 --> 02:27:28.840
This is reclaimed farm wood from a hundred year old farm.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2591
02:27:28.850 --> 02:27:31.150
They cut it down.
Supposedly they might have lied to me.

2592
02:27:31.220 --> 02:27:32.630
You might have found this shit.

2593
02:27:32.631 --> 02:27:36.220
It's made in the u s but it's really China until the stupid fuck.
It's organic.

2594
02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:39.340
Tell him it's gluten free.
What is this screen behind us?

2595
02:27:39.370 --> 02:27:43.800
This thing that's some shit that the fucking people who produced the TV show,

2596
02:27:43.820 --> 02:27:46.240
Scifi show created.
They put it back there.

2597
02:27:46.241 --> 02:27:48.370
They thought it was important to have something back there.

2598
02:27:48.620 --> 02:27:51.820
She makes the light look,
doesn't do anything now or is it just hangs out.

2599
02:27:51.980 --> 02:27:55.360
Just chills and turn the lights on.
Oh look at that

2600
02:27:56.860 --> 02:27:59.120
swimming pool at night,
but we don't think of that.

2601
02:27:59.230 --> 02:28:02.230
It'll do that to the wall to without that thing.
It'll just,

2602
02:28:02.231 --> 02:28:05.080
those are just a little lights that we have on the ground.
Well,
it looks great.

2603
02:28:05.350 --> 02:28:09.060
It sets a great tone in here.
Thank you very much,
Sam Trim.
Very sexy.

2604
02:28:09.061 --> 02:28:10.990
I'm glad you enjoy the Humvee halls.

2605
02:28:11.020 --> 02:28:13.930
Very excited about working with you to this weekend.
I,
uh,

2606
02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:17.590
I'm very excited about doing the cow.
As you can tell.
I'm excited about,
uh,

2607
02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:22.040
the comedy Magic Club.
I,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm going over my set,
you know,

2608
02:28:22.110 --> 02:28:25.430
<v 2>I,
I want to rock it,
but I also,
I,
I,
you know,</v>

2609
02:28:25.431 --> 02:28:28.130
I'm not a guy who likes to go into a comedy club and be like,
fuck you.

2610
02:28:28.131 --> 02:28:30.890
I'm gonna do what I want to do.
I love the county magic club.

2611
02:28:30.891 --> 02:28:34.810
I know they like it a little cleaner,
so I'm working on what my set should be.

2612
02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:38.660
Well,
I'm not going to be clean because I'm,
but I'm not going to.
I listen,
man.

2613
02:28:38.661 --> 02:28:42.410
I don't want it,
you know,
I don't know.
I actually don't know.
I'm just rambling.

2614
02:28:42.650 --> 02:28:44.030
I'm just trying to figure it out.

2615
02:28:44.031 --> 02:28:47.430
Like what I should do should finish that Starbucks coffee.
That's what it is.

2616
02:28:47.431 --> 02:28:50.060
Is that coffee or tea in there?
That's coffee.
You got fired up.

2617
02:28:50.820 --> 02:28:52.490
Well I've got to figure it out.
What I'm going to do.

2618
02:28:52.491 --> 02:28:55.160
It's a weird thing cause cause I'm working for you and you're like kind of do

2619
02:28:55.161 --> 02:28:57.980
whatever you want.
But then it's a club that's kind of what likes clean.

2620
02:28:58.010 --> 02:28:59.900
So what you're saying is you working for me,

2621
02:28:59.901 --> 02:29:02.610
but you're also working to impress the clubs.
He can come back.
Yeah.

2622
02:29:03.740 --> 02:29:07.340
No I do.
I get that.
I'm not there kind of comic.

2623
02:29:07.370 --> 02:29:11.990
So I get that and it's a great club.
They have their once a year maybe,

2624
02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:16.400
but it's like I don't want to go in there and be like,
just shit on the rules.

2625
02:29:16.401 --> 02:29:20.810
It's not my way.
It's not rules,
dude.
Don't worry about that.
Mike's fine.

2626
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:25.430
He's a good guy.
He's not going to book anyway.
I get that.
But I don't know.

2627
02:29:25.431 --> 02:29:28.880
I have this thing that I'm like,
I don't want to piss people off.

2628
02:29:28.881 --> 02:29:32.390
I don't know why to shut a guy throwing a chair at me to worry about it.

2629
02:29:32.391 --> 02:29:35.270
That's the store.
I'm telling you this,
first of all,
the stores haunted,

2630
02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:36.081
you know that.

2631
02:29:36.081 --> 02:29:38.510
And I know that if I ever believed in ghosts and I never saw a ghost,

2632
02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:43.540
there's an energy to store.
I,
uh,

2633
02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:47.380
I,
I had seen a ghost where,
well,

2634
02:29:47.381 --> 02:29:50.010
one time I was in the green room and I was,
uh,

2635
02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:54.220
I was all alone and I was just writing and get my set ready.

2636
02:29:54.221 --> 02:29:57.520
And all of a sudden I hear the,
the,
in the shower,

2637
02:29:57.521 --> 02:29:59.320
they have a shower in the green room,
the main room.

2638
02:29:59.380 --> 02:30:03.430
I heard the faucet just turning.
I'm like,

2639
02:30:03.431 --> 02:30:08.290
what the fuck?
And the water started going.
I'm like,
dude,
that's some crazy shit.

2640
02:30:08.500 --> 02:30:10.600
Well,
another time I was,
uh,

2641
02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:15.280
promoting the naughty show there and I'd run into the lobby of the main room and

2642
02:30:15.281 --> 02:30:16.390
it was completely bright.

2643
02:30:16.420 --> 02:30:20.050
And then I ran back and I had to go grab something from my car and they come

2644
02:30:20.051 --> 02:30:23.080
back and the room was dark.
And I'm like,

2645
02:30:23.170 --> 02:30:26.320
and Jeff Ross in his writing staff from a show where all the,
I'm like,

2646
02:30:26.410 --> 02:30:29.410
did you see anyone go through here and turn this off?
They're like,
no,

2647
02:30:29.411 --> 02:30:31.990
nobody's come through here since you came through.
I'm like,
okay.

2648
02:30:32.440 --> 02:30:34.030
So I started getting a little freaked out.

2649
02:30:34.210 --> 02:30:39.190
So I walk into the lobby and it's pitch black,
but there's this weird one light,

2650
02:30:40.030 --> 02:30:44.680
this bright white light going against kind of where Tommy used to w stands,

2651
02:30:44.681 --> 02:30:49.510
which is kind of where the cashier areas of the main room lobby and it's this

2652
02:30:49.511 --> 02:30:53.710
white light and it's kind of a weird reflection coming from sunset street.

2653
02:30:53.711 --> 02:30:55.780
It's like bouncing off.
It's coming from,

2654
02:30:55.781 --> 02:31:00.720
they're bouncing off the glass door and then it's hitting this thing and I'd

2655
02:31:00.721 --> 02:31:02.620
have had no clue how the white light is getting there.

2656
02:31:02.890 --> 02:31:06.130
And I'm just looking at also,
and they see just his finger go rape front of light

2657
02:31:07.660 --> 02:31:10.540
and I'm just like,
ah,
okay.
I'm fucking Outta here.

2658
02:31:10.541 --> 02:31:13.270
And I just went in the other room and made them go turn the lights on.

2659
02:31:16.380 --> 02:31:20.100
So you saw something go in front it like this.

2660
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:23.370
<v 1>Just this,
just figure,
just go right in front of that white light.</v>

2661
02:31:23.550 --> 02:31:26.520
Is it possible there was some sort of a reflection from outside?

2662
02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:31.830
It's possible,
but it's,
I wouldn't put my,
maybe it's possible,

2663
02:31:31.831 --> 02:31:34.980
but all I know is that was light in the lobby.
I come back,

2664
02:31:34.981 --> 02:31:39.240
it's pitch black and I just see something go right in front of this white light.

2665
02:31:40.170 --> 02:31:44.880
Hmm.
You know,
it's not impossible,
man.
I don't,
I don't think that it's impossible.

2666
02:31:45.210 --> 02:31:48.630
I've talked about before on this show about how I believe it's like I believe in

2667
02:31:48.631 --> 02:31:52.470
ghosts because I think everything is energy and his transfer of energy and you

2668
02:31:52.471 --> 02:31:54.450
always hear like when ghosts happen,

2669
02:31:54.540 --> 02:31:57.000
it's always when some violent crime it happened,

2670
02:31:57.180 --> 02:32:00.480
which I always think fucks with the transfer,
the energy.

2671
02:32:00.481 --> 02:32:05.010
When you get absorbed back in to the whole,
you know the connection,

2672
02:32:05.250 --> 02:32:09.510
when your energy goes and you get absorb backed in the some violence fucks with

2673
02:32:09.511 --> 02:32:13.410
that transfer and your energy ended up getting,
it's in between here and there.

2674
02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:18.060
So that's where the ghosts come from.
Why it might be possible.

2675
02:32:18.180 --> 02:32:23.130
I mean the idea was proposed by a guy named Rupert Sheldrake think he's an

2676
02:32:23.131 --> 02:32:24.240
evolutionary biologist,

2677
02:32:24.241 --> 02:32:27.130
but he had this idea that everything has memory and then let go.

2678
02:32:27.150 --> 02:32:30.090
That's why people wouldn't want to buy houses that when people died in them,

2679
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:32.310
that there's a feeling of those,

2680
02:32:32.380 --> 02:32:35.280
that those experiences are still stuck in that space.

2681
02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:40.800
I don't know if that's true or not,
but my,
uh,
my dad is not a very,
um,

2682
02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:44.520
he's my Stepdad,
but he's,
you know,
call my dad.
I don't really know my real dad,

2683
02:32:44.550 --> 02:32:49.080
but he's not a,
not a very,
uh,
he's not a spiritual guy,
not a woo guy,

2684
02:32:49.130 --> 02:32:50.130
not religious at all,

2685
02:32:50.460 --> 02:32:54.330
but he went to Gettysburg and he told me that he had a really bad experience

2686
02:32:54.331 --> 02:32:58.140
there.
He said it just like you could feel the death.
He goes,
it feels sad.

2687
02:32:58.410 --> 02:33:01.030
It's just like,
there's a feeling there and he goes,
it,

2688
02:33:01.031 --> 02:33:03.510
it might be because I knew what happened there.
He goes,

2689
02:33:03.511 --> 02:33:05.040
but it didn't feel like it.
He's like,

2690
02:33:05.041 --> 02:33:10.041
it just felt like there was something in the place that I could tangibly

2691
02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:16.080
interact with.
Yeah.
There's,
I mean,
if something violent and bad happen,

2692
02:33:16.110 --> 02:33:21.060
you can feel it in the air.
Yeah.
It is possible.
Right.
Yeah.
I,
again,

2693
02:33:21.061 --> 02:33:24.300
it's like my opinion on transfer of energy,
everything's connected.

2694
02:33:24.301 --> 02:33:27.870
Might just be something that is really difficult to register.

2695
02:33:28.290 --> 02:33:30.780
Something that's really difficult.
Like there's,

2696
02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:35.490
there's a lot of people that automatically like shew the idea way shoe.

2697
02:33:35.491 --> 02:33:40.470
Any idea why?
If that idea seems to be like a Wacko idea,

2698
02:33:40.500 --> 02:33:43.400
like they don't go,
hmm man,
maybe,
but think of God,

2699
02:33:43.470 --> 02:33:47.880
how many fucking people have told ghost stories?
Is it possible?

2700
02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:50.580
There's something to that is all the imagination.

2701
02:33:50.610 --> 02:33:53.960
I mean it could all be the imagination.
It could just be like a,

2702
02:33:53.970 --> 02:33:57.060
an archetype that keeps repeating itself over and over again in the human
psyche.

2703
02:33:57.510 --> 02:34:02.510
Is it possible that there's things that can't be proven through science in terms

2704
02:34:02.971 --> 02:34:07.530
of the what we judge as scientific proof?
I think it's possible.

2705
02:34:07.531 --> 02:34:09.780
That could be.
I think it's also possibly it's,

2706
02:34:09.870 --> 02:34:13.380
it's also possible that there could be a whole nother dimension that we don't

2707
02:34:13.381 --> 02:34:17.190
experience and this man current state,
there might be another dimension.

2708
02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:21.060
Consciousness,
lives,
you know,
there,
there might be another dimension where your,

2709
02:34:21.070 --> 02:34:25.960
your,
your soul goes after you die.
It sounds ridiculous but so does regular life,

2710
02:34:26.310 --> 02:34:31.110
<v 2>well,
your episode on Psychics,
man,
I totally relate to that.
I mean I've,
I've had,</v>

2711
02:34:31.140 --> 02:34:31.741
I just,
again,

2712
02:34:31.741 --> 02:34:36.030
I feel like everything's internet connected through energy and that some people

2713
02:34:36.031 --> 02:34:38.100
may be able to,
uh,

2714
02:34:38.101 --> 02:34:41.640
connect with the energy a little better than other people and maybe they see

2715
02:34:41.641 --> 02:34:43.260
stuff that's going to happen maybe,

2716
02:34:43.261 --> 02:34:47.190
but the episode on psychics showed more about charlatans and anything.

2717
02:34:47.460 --> 02:34:49.950
There was part of that.
But I mean,
personally,
I mean,

2718
02:34:49.951 --> 02:34:54.680
that's just one instance in which I personally believe that there are people who

2719
02:34:54.681 --> 02:34:57.960
can tap into an energy that other people maybe can't.

2720
02:34:58.030 --> 02:35:00.490
<v 1>It's certainly possible.
I don't,
I can't do it.
Um,</v>

2721
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:04.120
and I couldn't prove anybody could do it on the show and we didn't,

2722
02:35:04.121 --> 02:35:05.920
we couldn't get anybody to show us they could do it.

2723
02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:10.090
The most likely thing we had on the show was a guy pretending to be psychic that

2724
02:35:10.091 --> 02:35:13.450
was telling us in advance that he was,
it's guy a check.
Yeah.
He saw that,

2725
02:35:13.451 --> 02:35:16.240
faked it.
And he told us,
he told us in advance,

2726
02:35:16.241 --> 02:35:17.410
I'm going to pretend to be psychic.

2727
02:35:17.620 --> 02:35:21.400
He fooled a series of scientists for four years with all these tricks that he

2728
02:35:21.401 --> 02:35:24.610
does.
I mean he's just a master at,
they won't tell you how he does it,

2729
02:35:24.611 --> 02:35:28.120
but he tells you he's doing,
I want to know how he did the,
uh,
the dice.

2730
02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:30.040
I want to know how we did all of it.
The dice thing.

2731
02:35:30.041 --> 02:35:33.760
I looked at it and he had his hand in his pocket while I was rolling the dice.

2732
02:35:33.970 --> 02:35:37.310
And I wonder if there's something in his pocket that registered,

2733
02:35:37.311 --> 02:35:40.720
like he could touch it.
And it gives him like two zaps for two,

2734
02:35:40.721 --> 02:35:44.560
three Zaps for three.
Like it lets him know like what the number is.

2735
02:35:45.670 --> 02:35:50.200
It is possible.
It is possible that he does that.
That could be a possibility.

2736
02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:51.460
Oh fine.
Though.

2737
02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:55.150
<v 2>My cousins supposedly can,
if you hand him something,</v>

2738
02:35:55.660 --> 02:35:58.750
he can put it in his hand and he could tell you where it's been and what's

2739
02:35:58.751 --> 02:36:02.730
happened to it was the smell.
It?
No,
he's got,
it's like,

2740
02:36:03.930 --> 02:36:07.240
oh shit.
Oh dice.

2741
02:36:07.250 --> 02:36:11.370
Who's the psychic dice?
The psychic.
Hmm.

2742
02:36:12.150 --> 02:36:16.300
They lost the credit mother.
I can see you sucking my dick.

2743
02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:19.800
Oh,
sexual sidekick.

2744
02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:25.050
[inaudible] sidekick.
I feel your weapon.
My balls.
Um,

2745
02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:30.760
how will you show what,
yeah,
man,
we did a show with him in Vegas.

2746
02:36:30.761 --> 02:36:34.480
I was doing the naughty show at the hard rock casino and in Vinyl,

2747
02:36:34.481 --> 02:36:38.180
which is gorgeous club and a man.
That Guy Packs Amanda.

2748
02:36:38.310 --> 02:36:42.210
<v 1>Oh yeah.
Well Dude,
we,
me Norton,
Bobby Kelly,</v>

2749
02:36:42.330 --> 02:36:44.400
Anthony Mia,
red band,

2750
02:36:44.420 --> 02:36:48.000
and Sam Roberts went to see him at the Riviera.

2751
02:36:48.001 --> 02:36:50.310
He was upstairs in the big room and the fucking

2752
02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:55.240
<v 2>killed.
It was hilarious to dice as a master.
It was really funny,
man.</v>

2753
02:36:55.241 --> 02:36:59.520
It was really enjoyable.
It was really,
it was,
it was an enjoyable show.

2754
02:36:59.540 --> 02:37:01.690
Was a good time watching him do his,
ah,

2755
02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:06.610
his Carol's doing the rhymes on a new years.
About eight years ago.

2756
02:37:06.611 --> 02:37:11.200
It was one of my favorite moments of comedy because I had grown up on that
stuff.

2757
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:13.060
Hickory dickory dock.

2758
02:37:13.090 --> 02:37:16.850
I grew up on that and it crushed.

2759
02:37:17.450 --> 02:37:21.010
<v 1>Yeah,
he was a,
he was a big part of my youth too.
Listen,</v>

2760
02:37:21.030 --> 02:37:24.200
I remember listening to him in my car with this girl that I was dating,

2761
02:37:24.201 --> 02:37:27.500
just giggling like a couple of retards.
We thought it was so funny.

2762
02:37:27.501 --> 02:37:29.930
And that was like the first cassette that he had been that first cassette

2763
02:37:31.800 --> 02:37:35.840
zillion before social media and all that stuff.
Oh yeah.
It was on social media.

2764
02:37:36.170 --> 02:37:40.640
Well,
he was really unique in that people could repeat his stuff,
you know,
dice,

2765
02:37:40.641 --> 02:37:44.360
like you wanted to hear the same stuff over and over again,
like a rock band,

2766
02:37:44.620 --> 02:37:48.260
go read deck every doc that people would just start chanting along with it.

2767
02:37:48.620 --> 02:37:50.390
Oh my God.
Yeah.
He was great.

2768
02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:54.410
He booked today can understand like you can't wrap your head around how big he

2769
02:37:54.411 --> 02:37:57.190
was that he was so fucking bay.

2770
02:37:57.191 --> 02:38:01.730
And there was this massive backlash from the so called liberal media again,

2771
02:38:01.820 --> 02:38:04.820
people who wanted him to be like everybody else.
Yep.

2772
02:38:04.860 --> 02:38:07.760
And they couldn't just accept and they couldn't accept also that this was a

2773
02:38:07.761 --> 02:38:09.910
character,
like this was a,
this is,

2774
02:38:09.911 --> 02:38:13.880
these are his real thoughts and this homophobia and his,
which,
you know,

2775
02:38:13.890 --> 02:38:16.850
it did say a lot of like really,
really shit different time.

2776
02:38:17.390 --> 02:38:19.810
So what was his homophobia is okay back then?
No.
Well,

2777
02:38:19.811 --> 02:38:21.610
it's just a different way of dealing with it.
Yeah.

2778
02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:23.860
<v 2>You know,
I mean,
people learn,
oh,
you know,
it's like when,</v>

2779
02:38:23.980 --> 02:38:27.370
when people get mad at the elderly people for saying racist stuff.
Yeah,

2780
02:38:27.371 --> 02:38:28.330
it's not right,

2781
02:38:28.540 --> 02:38:32.860
but it's a different time when your grandma show how your colored boyfriend is,

2782
02:38:32.980 --> 02:38:36.970
you know,
you don't throw grandma out the window.
It's a just a different time.

2783
02:38:37.090 --> 02:38:41.050
It's not right.
Or you a Paula Deen apologists not well.
Well,

2784
02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:43.180
hold on Paula Deen.
Listen,

2785
02:38:43.181 --> 02:38:45.580
I don't think you should call anyone the n word except for me in bed.

2786
02:38:45.581 --> 02:38:50.410
And that's just a true story.
But listen man,
I'm sorry,
but if I hit no,

2787
02:38:50.411 --> 02:38:55.060
the story,
right?
If you're robbing me at gunpoint,
is that what the story was?

2788
02:38:55.061 --> 02:38:58.210
She got robbed at gun point and said some mean shit.
Oh,
okay.

2789
02:38:58.211 --> 02:39:00.400
That's why I thought the story was if you robbed me at gun point,

2790
02:39:00.401 --> 02:39:01.234
I'm going to say some nasty

2791
02:39:01.450 --> 02:39:06.450
<v 1>and I think there was like employees involved just call up employees and words.</v>

2792
02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:11.060
<v 2>That's not right.
That's not right.
Dude.
I'm all love.</v>

2793
02:39:11.090 --> 02:39:16.010
I love everybody,
Dude.
I love everybody.
We got that.
We got that from you,
Sam.

2794
02:39:16.011 --> 02:39:18.770
That's what I've been feeling.
No,
you don't.
You don't feel that I do.

2795
02:39:18.771 --> 02:39:22.010
I feel that you don't feel,
I love everybody,
man.
I don't care.

2796
02:39:22.011 --> 02:39:24.480
But if you robbed me at gun point,
I'm going to say some names shifts.

2797
02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:28.530
One got robbed at gunpoint,
dude.
No,
that's what happened.
No,

2798
02:39:28.690 --> 02:39:32.110
<v 1>she didn't get robbed at gunpoint.
Gumbo.
Oh my God.</v>

2799
02:39:32.170 --> 02:39:36.520
Let's see what is wrong with you?
You have a phone dean robbed at gun point.

2800
02:39:36.521 --> 02:39:41.160
Why would you,
they asked her,
have you ever used the n word?

2801
02:39:41.161 --> 02:39:44.620
And she said yes,
of course.
And they asked her when she was held up at gunpoint,

2802
02:39:44.970 --> 02:39:49.630
burst into a bank that I was working 1987 crime she linked to,
oh,

2803
02:39:49.690 --> 02:39:51.130
okay.
I'm the asshole.

2804
02:39:51.790 --> 02:39:54.940
<v 2>Well this is,
it was also about her employees were saying,</v>

2805
02:39:57.220 --> 02:39:57.970
I agree with that.

2806
02:39:57.970 --> 02:40:01.540
I'm just saying that instant in which that's what got her in trouble.

2807
02:40:01.780 --> 02:40:03.120
Wait a minute,
is this really,
really

2808
02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:03.953
<v 1>it?</v>

2809
02:40:04.660 --> 02:40:09.660
She passed in the 1980s she uttered the racial slur while telling her husband

2810
02:40:10.231 --> 02:40:14.040
about being held up at gunpoint by a black.
That's it.
That's

2811
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:18.200
<v 3>when she used it.
Yeah.
I mean,
I'm sorry dude,</v>

2812
02:40:18.230 --> 02:40:19.190
but I'm sorry dude.

2813
02:40:19.191 --> 02:40:21.350
Cause I was saying that you didn't know what you're talking about was actually

2814
02:40:21.351 --> 02:40:22.184
me.

2815
02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:26.600
I know for a fact that her employees and accused her of doing it,

2816
02:40:27.670 --> 02:40:28.880
uh,
employee hold on.

2817
02:40:31.370 --> 02:40:32.840
Accused her of racism.

2818
02:40:34.810 --> 02:40:38.590
It started because a former manager sued her and that's where the deposition

2819
02:40:38.591 --> 02:40:39.281
started.
Yeah.

2820
02:40:39.281 --> 02:40:41.920
But how does that have anything to do with getting her getting robbed?

2821
02:40:42.250 --> 02:40:46.470
She asked her.
Okay,
hold up.
She asked her employee to dress up like aunt Jemima.

2822
02:40:47.460 --> 02:40:51.760
All right,
now it unfolds here.
Oh God.

2823
02:40:52.360 --> 02:40:53.530
Yeah.
This is different.

2824
02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:58.510
She kiss apparently after the robbery by gunpoint,

2825
02:40:58.540 --> 02:41:01.870
she held a grudge on the African American community,

2826
02:41:01.871 --> 02:41:04.930
but it also could be like an employee trying to get paid.

2827
02:41:05.470 --> 02:41:09.340
It's fucking hard dismissal.
Listen man,
listen,

2828
02:41:09.550 --> 02:41:14.410
I don't,
I believe I love,
I love diversity.
That's a big reason.

2829
02:41:14.411 --> 02:41:17.770
I love southern California.
Everybody's mixing with everybody.

2830
02:41:17.771 --> 02:41:18.940
I prefer it that way.

2831
02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:24.010
This guy who worked there said that Dean referred to her and other employees

2832
02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:25.840
using a racial slur.

2833
02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:31.230
The Times doesn't specify which besides that there is a racially offensive term

2834
02:41:31.751 --> 02:41:36.040
for black child.
Oh my goodness.
Do you know what that is?

2835
02:41:36.550 --> 02:41:40.540
No.
Niglet oh,
she's horrible.
She must have called them that.

2836
02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:43.780
But maybe I'm just making that up though.
They don't dismiss,
but c'mon.

2837
02:41:43.781 --> 02:41:46.720
How fucked is it that you could write a story about this but don't want to say

2838
02:41:46.721 --> 02:41:49.660
the actual word.
Yeah,
it's,
I don't want to say,

2839
02:41:49.810 --> 02:41:53.770
but what it is offensive word for black children.

2840
02:41:54.300 --> 02:41:58.490
But say the fucking word.
Why are we pretending that if it's,

2841
02:41:58.500 --> 02:42:02.860
if the word is so bad you can't say it,
then it's magic,
then it's,

2842
02:42:02.861 --> 02:42:07.840
then it's candy man.
Can,
why I'm at the store and let us know what's going on.

2843
02:42:07.841 --> 02:42:11.950
So we know exactly the degree of racism here.

2844
02:42:12.370 --> 02:42:16.810
Um,
yeah,
I don't know.
I didn't realize that she was,

2845
02:42:16.990 --> 02:42:19.810
I thought she just like had used the word before.

2846
02:42:20.170 --> 02:42:23.500
I didn't realize that she had used it because she got robbed.

2847
02:42:23.890 --> 02:42:27.430
When you get robbed,
you just fucking call people.
Everything you could think of.

2848
02:42:27.490 --> 02:42:28.750
It's when you dealing with a heck,

2849
02:42:28.780 --> 02:42:31.330
if you're heckling means we worse than heckling young,

2850
02:42:31.331 --> 02:42:34.480
you're relieved like life or death situation.
Possibly.

2851
02:42:34.810 --> 02:42:36.100
You'd probably freaking out.

2852
02:42:36.220 --> 02:42:41.110
You probably so high on adrenaline and fear.

2853
02:42:41.140 --> 02:42:41.681
What does it say?

2854
02:42:41.681 --> 02:42:46.090
It got dismissed in case officially closed judge approved dismissal of the case.

2855
02:42:46.091 --> 02:42:49.570
So that's the guy
who knows,
man.

2856
02:42:49.980 --> 02:42:53.440
You got to look at things like that from a bunch of different angles.
One,

2857
02:42:53.441 --> 02:42:55.210
if she is racist,
that's kind of fucked up,

2858
02:42:55.211 --> 02:43:00.211
but to she's famous and rich and I'm sure people who work for her look at that

2859
02:43:00.251 --> 02:43:03.040
as a target and they're easily could have been something that she,

2860
02:43:05.100 --> 02:43:07.530
Paula Dean's robber comes to her defense.

2861
02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:14.320
Jeanne Thomas King is the bank robber who Paula Deen says she referred to using

2862
02:43:14.321 --> 02:43:16.570
the n word after he robbed her at gunpoint.

2863
02:43:17.050 --> 02:43:21.160
King was caught and sentenced to 25 years in prison after the dean robbery and a

2864
02:43:21.161 --> 02:43:24.880
separate robbery.
He lives in Brooklyn,
New York now.
And when we spoke to him,

2865
02:43:24.970 --> 02:43:29.140
he actually broke down in tears.
He blames himself for Paula Dean's troubles.

2866
02:43:30.070 --> 02:43:31.330
I really feel for her.

2867
02:43:31.331 --> 02:43:35.800
King said she's being persecuted because that one little mistake in her
judgment,

2868
02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:38.470
she was acting out of anger.
Wow.
Look at this guy.

2869
02:43:38.471 --> 02:43:40.540
He really came to grips with reality in court.

2870
02:43:41.020 --> 02:43:44.890
He had 13 prior convictions for robbery before he pointed his gun.

2871
02:43:44.891 --> 02:43:47.700
You need 14 before they can legally be called a nigger.
Yeah,

2872
02:43:48.110 --> 02:43:50.710
it's 14 I've seen it.
Um,

2873
02:43:50.770 --> 02:43:54.460
and he says that he's turned his life around good for him,
good for him,

2874
02:43:54.461 --> 02:43:56.800
and also good for him saying that man,
you know,

2875
02:43:56.801 --> 02:43:59.860
that's like that's some clarity that a lot of people are not capable of.

2876
02:44:00.250 --> 02:44:03.670
Sometimes people have to actually go through something really fucked up so they

2877
02:44:03.671 --> 02:44:08.240
can see like what they're really doing.
Yeah.
Good for that guy.

2878
02:44:08.241 --> 02:44:12.820
My life,
my life.
Well,
I don't know if that's the only time she used that word.

2879
02:44:13.390 --> 02:44:14.230
Yeah,
I'm with you.

2880
02:44:14.231 --> 02:44:17.290
I'm just saying that was the incidence that which I heard in which I would tell

2881
02:44:17.291 --> 02:44:20.500
you that if I'm robbed at gunpoint by saying I'm going to say some nasty shit,

2882
02:44:20.640 --> 02:44:24.520
it's in the heat of the moment,
you know?
And even afterwards,
two hours later,

2883
02:44:24.521 --> 02:44:28.250
if I'm talking to my girl,
I'm going to be like,
oh,
that's weird though.

2884
02:44:28.310 --> 02:44:33.070
It's weird that she gets persecuted for that.
If this is nine 1980s,
I mean,

2885
02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:35.470
that's 30 years ago,
20

2886
02:44:38.050 --> 02:44:42.850
at least 20 you know,
is it the 19?

2887
02:44:42.910 --> 02:44:46.600
What is the exact year?
If it was 1990,

2888
02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:51.070
it would be 23 years ago.
She was 19 so it's more than 23 years ago.

2889
02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:55.510
Jesus Christ,
you know,
it's like that,
uh,
that,

2890
02:44:56.380 --> 02:44:57.190
that uh,

2891
02:44:57.190 --> 02:45:01.180
athletic director at Rutgers who's getting in a lot of trouble for saying stuff

2892
02:45:01.870 --> 02:45:06.190
that she had said at a previous job decades before that.
And you know,

2893
02:45:06.191 --> 02:45:10.920
maybe what she says rough.
But I mean,
people change,
man,
learn it.

2894
02:45:10.980 --> 02:45:12.940
You know,
especially myself.
I mean,
the,
the,

2895
02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:16.630
the things I've done in my life and that's sometimes how he treated people.

2896
02:45:16.770 --> 02:45:17.940
It wasn't right.
You know,
and I,

2897
02:45:17.941 --> 02:45:22.010
I've learned and I make amends and I move on and to be judged by something that

2898
02:45:22.020 --> 02:45:26.350
happened way long goes.
I think that's a horrible way.

2899
02:45:26.380 --> 02:45:27.730
It is horrible.
And it's also,

2900
02:45:27.790 --> 02:45:32.080
it's taking out the possibility of someone improving as a human being and

2901
02:45:32.081 --> 02:45:33.130
learning from mistakes,

2902
02:45:33.370 --> 02:45:36.580
holding you accountable to something that you did 20 years ago or even a fucking

2903
02:45:36.581 --> 02:45:38.410
year ago.
Man.
Let's be honest about that.

2904
02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:39.940
You're not the person you were a year ago.

2905
02:45:39.941 --> 02:45:41.590
If you're constantly evolving and growing,

2906
02:45:41.860 --> 02:45:44.470
you mean you might owe an apology for something he did a year ago,

2907
02:45:44.471 --> 02:45:47.560
but saying that defines you and a year is kind of stretching it for a lot of

2908
02:45:47.561 --> 02:45:49.900
people.
Cause a lot of people are the same person they were a year ago,

2909
02:45:50.350 --> 02:45:53.890
but six years ago,
10 years ago.
Are you the same person?
I sure as fuck,

2910
02:45:53.891 --> 02:45:57.920
I'm not going to totally different human being than I was 10 years ago.
You,
you,

2911
02:45:58.000 --> 02:45:58.330
you,

2912
02:45:58.330 --> 02:46:01.420
if you're paying attention and you're working on yourself and you're constantly

2913
02:46:01.421 --> 02:46:05.260
trying to think and look at the world objectively,
you're going to grow.

2914
02:46:05.410 --> 02:46:07.900
You're going to learn from mistakes and if you're not making any mistakes,

2915
02:46:08.110 --> 02:46:09.980
you're not taking any fucking,
yeah,

2916
02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:11.270
<v 1>it's my whole theory.</v>

2917
02:46:11.330 --> 02:46:15.690
I was talking about on stage about how everyone got mad at the NSA and there was

2918
02:46:15.710 --> 02:46:17.240
people like,
I don't care.
I've got nothing to hide.

2919
02:46:17.241 --> 02:46:19.220
It's like who doesn't have anything to hide man?

2920
02:46:19.390 --> 02:46:22.520
Like are you not living any life?
That's not the point.
Anyway,

2921
02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:25.640
the point is not the nothing that that idea is so silly.

2922
02:46:25.641 --> 02:46:27.890
I've got nothing to hide.
Well it doesn't matter.

2923
02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:29.990
You can't give people that kind of power.

2924
02:46:30.090 --> 02:46:35.090
The saying something like that is just without a doubt being ignorant about

2925
02:46:35.091 --> 02:46:38.990
human behavior cause absolute power.
There's the old quote PR corrupts.

2926
02:46:38.991 --> 02:46:40.670
Absolutely.
It always has.

2927
02:46:40.780 --> 02:46:43.100
And when you give someone the ability to look in on your email,

2928
02:46:43.101 --> 02:46:45.110
Snowden was saying that he could just read people's emails,

2929
02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:48.170
you can just target Sam Aaa and you start reading your emails.
Oh God.

2930
02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:52.370
And he didn't even have a high school education that you can't give people that

2931
02:46:52.371 --> 02:46:56.290
power.
You can't give people the power to stalk.
You can't give people the law,

2932
02:46:56.320 --> 02:47:00.470
the power to peer in let's creeper shit and you don't have to do anything wrong.

2933
02:47:00.471 --> 02:47:03.380
I mean we looked at,
I mean there are through history,

2934
02:47:03.381 --> 02:47:06.780
we've seen people who are profiled by agencies and you know,

2935
02:47:06.860 --> 02:47:08.420
he frank Sinatra,

2936
02:47:08.421 --> 02:47:12.020
Martin Luther king who weren't necessarily doing anything wrong but they were

2937
02:47:12.021 --> 02:47:15.680
being monitored.
It's like you don't have to do something wrong to be monitored.

2938
02:47:15.681 --> 02:47:19.340
Well that's the j Edgar Hoover days.
And before that of course the McCarthyism,

2939
02:47:19.550 --> 02:47:24.550
but the McCarthy era is a classic example of people being persecuted and people

2940
02:47:24.891 --> 02:47:29.891
being singled out and people being spied upon and categorize these dangerous and

2941
02:47:30.410 --> 02:47:35.210
divisive groups.
That kind of behavior is unconstitutional for a reason.

2942
02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:39.050
Looking into people's lives is a violation of privacy and it's unconstitutional

2943
02:47:39.051 --> 02:47:39.884
for reasoning.

2944
02:47:39.890 --> 02:47:44.000
We have to recognize that there is always been people that are looking to

2945
02:47:44.001 --> 02:47:48.920
capitalize on the holes that we have in our system and they will create false

2946
02:47:48.921 --> 02:47:50.900
flags and through those false flags,

2947
02:47:50.901 --> 02:47:54.080
these events will cause them to clamp down more on security.
It will curl.

2948
02:47:54.090 --> 02:47:57.320
Interesting,
right?
It's ridiculous,
but it's true.

2949
02:47:57.610 --> 02:48:01.820
They will create artificial problems so that they will have a solution.

2950
02:48:01.970 --> 02:48:06.410
Create a problem,
propose a solution,
get what you want.
What did you want?

2951
02:48:06.411 --> 02:48:09.680
We wanted to be able to control people.
We want them to Norway,
alien society.

2952
02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:10.850
How do we go about doing it?

2953
02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:12.860
What were you going to have to have a threat and you're going to have to have

2954
02:48:12.861 --> 02:48:14.450
this threat,
let's call it terrorism.

2955
02:48:14.451 --> 02:48:17.180
Terrorism is a good threat because it's so undefined.

2956
02:48:17.181 --> 02:48:20.690
It's not like we conquer one nation and our terrorism problem is over.

2957
02:48:20.810 --> 02:48:24.320
It continues forever and for people to think that some tinfoil hat conspiracy

2958
02:48:24.321 --> 02:48:27.470
bullshit,
you're really not paying attention because it's happened.

2959
02:48:27.471 --> 02:48:29.300
It's happened over and over and over again.
Yeah.

2960
02:48:29.301 --> 02:48:32.180
I mean even if you talk about conspiracy theories with some people,

2961
02:48:32.181 --> 02:48:36.170
they can't even begin to understand it because they're looking at through their

2962
02:48:36.171 --> 02:48:39.590
point of view.
My whole thing is like if you ever watch the first 48 man,

2963
02:48:39.710 --> 02:48:41.960
it's this great show.
It's about it sadly,

2964
02:48:41.961 --> 02:48:44.910
about murder and Marie real murder investigation.

2965
02:48:45.110 --> 02:48:50.110
You see people killing other people for $20 dollars.

2966
02:48:51.140 --> 02:48:55.760
Now just imagine if there was $1 billion on the line,
$1 trillion on the line,

2967
02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:59.150
just because someone's in the suit,
they're not standing on a corner,

2968
02:48:59.210 --> 02:49:02.210
they're going to act different.
No,
it's all primal basic thing.

2969
02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:04.630
This special pull the trigger themselves.
Yeah.

2970
02:49:04.700 --> 02:49:09.600
It's designed to get as much resources as possible.
That's what it's all about.

2971
02:49:09.810 --> 02:49:14.190
I mean,
it's basic human behavior and if you can get it through the guise of war,

2972
02:49:14.430 --> 02:49:16.410
it's really easy to get things done.

2973
02:49:16.470 --> 02:49:19.650
You just hire much and now they have mercenaries.
I mean there,

2974
02:49:19.651 --> 02:49:20.610
during the Bush administration,

2975
02:49:20.611 --> 02:49:23.640
they started using mercenaries for the first time in God knows how long man

2976
02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:27.600
openly using like blackwater and all these other companies go in and do a bunch

2977
02:49:27.601 --> 02:49:30.510
of shit.
Those dudes in Afghanistan,
I know some of those dudes,

2978
02:49:31.020 --> 02:49:33.060
I have friends that went over there and did some work for them.

2979
02:49:33.061 --> 02:49:36.210
I have a friend who was a sniper in the marines and he made more money in doing

2980
02:49:36.211 --> 02:49:37.800
that than he ever did doing anything.

2981
02:49:37.801 --> 02:49:40.680
He would go over there for a few months at a time,
made like 30 grand a month,

2982
02:49:41.550 --> 02:49:42.750
come back bank man.

2983
02:49:42.751 --> 02:49:46.440
But it's like that guy in Chicago who went around and and fortunately killed all

2984
02:49:46.441 --> 02:49:48.270
those people shooting.
You know what that was about?

2985
02:49:48.450 --> 02:49:52.580
That was them trying to take over territory.
They thought that area,
that,

2986
02:49:52.581 --> 02:49:54.690
that block or that,
that uh,

2987
02:49:54.780 --> 02:49:59.780
that blacktop was another gangs territory and they didn't care who they shot.

2988
02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:04.740
They just wanted to shoot.
Yeah.
So they don't care if they take out 13 people,

2989
02:50:04.770 --> 02:50:07.590
they just want to gain a certain amount of power.
And resources.

2990
02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:11.490
Same thing like you know the government does something where I'll bunch people

2991
02:50:11.491 --> 02:50:15.960
die.
Any of,
whether it's 1002003000 5,000 whatever,

2992
02:50:16.140 --> 02:50:19.620
it doesn't matter in the bigger picture of everything.
Yeah,

2993
02:50:19.621 --> 02:50:22.920
and they also know that time will continue to roll on.

2994
02:50:22.950 --> 02:50:27.250
More conflicts will arise and people forget about it.
Constant state of war.
Yeah.

2995
02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:30.900
People forget about so many different things that happened in the past.

2996
02:50:30.901 --> 02:50:33.510
They forget about different bombs that went off different.

2997
02:50:33.810 --> 02:50:37.050
They're going to forget about this mall in Africa after a while people are going

2998
02:50:37.051 --> 02:50:39.750
to forget about,
you know the,
the bomb,
the,
the,

2999
02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:43.270
the Iraqi's blew up on the u s warship.
There's,

3000
02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:48.060
there's so many different events in the course of a decade of war plus that

3001
02:50:48.061 --> 02:50:51.820
we've been involved in that they can just tally them all up and push them all

3002
02:50:51.821 --> 02:50:54.630
aside.
As long as there's some new thing in the news to think about,

3003
02:50:54.780 --> 02:50:56.670
people will keep thinking.
Do you feel it?

3004
02:50:56.671 --> 02:51:00.800
This naval yard thing hit as hard as Mosley.

3005
02:51:00.840 --> 02:51:04.320
I feel like it happened and everyone's like,
Nah,
another one.
Yeah.

3006
02:51:04.321 --> 02:51:08.850
We're getting desensitized.
Video.
What is this video of the guy shooting?

3007
02:51:08.860 --> 02:51:12.450
Anyone that's coming in with all your weapons and stuff?
Yeah,
it's pretty chilly.

3008
02:51:12.750 --> 02:51:15.990
Yeah.
I don't want to see it either,
but it's,
um,
yeah,

3009
02:51:15.991 --> 02:51:18.720
this is more where we're used to it.
They're Aurora,
Colorado.

3010
02:51:18.721 --> 02:51:20.160
One would now kind of forgot about it.

3011
02:51:20.161 --> 02:51:22.860
We're thinking about a new thing now where people are going to keep sanctity.

3012
02:51:22.890 --> 02:51:24.460
You're going to keep thinking about new things,
keeps,

3013
02:51:24.461 --> 02:51:27.180
keeps sticking things in front of their face and they forget about something

3014
02:51:27.181 --> 02:51:29.070
that happened a month ago.
Hey,
can I ask you,

3015
02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:33.630
I know in England the law enforcement doesn't carry guns,
but it does.

3016
02:51:33.810 --> 02:51:36.510
I know Canada has very strict gun laws,
right?

3017
02:51:37.250 --> 02:51:40.830
Does Canadian police carry?
Yes.
Yeah,
they have guns.

3018
02:51:41.160 --> 02:51:44.490
I always felt that that was a big issue with gun.
With England's.
It certainly is.

3019
02:51:44.790 --> 02:51:48.220
Yeah.
England.
It really is.
You know,
and there's a,
you know,

3020
02:51:48.390 --> 02:51:52.050
there's arguments both ways.
The problem with guns is like that expression.

3021
02:51:52.051 --> 02:51:54.570
You can't take p out of the pool once they're out there,

3022
02:51:54.571 --> 02:51:58.020
they're out there and in England and out there nearly as much as they are in

3023
02:51:58.021 --> 02:52:02.010
America.
They don't have nearly as many gun violence crimes,

3024
02:52:02.011 --> 02:52:06.010
but we do,
you know,
we do.
We,
we,
we,

3025
02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:08.260
and people have the right to protect themselves.
You know,

3026
02:52:08.261 --> 02:52:10.690
it's not like you're going to round up all the guns.

3027
02:52:10.691 --> 02:52:11.530
They're not going to let you,

3028
02:52:11.710 --> 02:52:14.320
this country is not going to let you round up all the guns.
We've got a,

3029
02:52:14.321 --> 02:52:15.610
we've got a sticky situation.

3030
02:52:15.640 --> 02:52:18.670
I think it's more of a mental health situation than it is anything.

3031
02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:23.770
I completely agree.
100% sky,
the Aurora shooter,
the kids that were in,
um,

3032
02:52:23.830 --> 02:52:27.730
the,
uh,
the Columbine kids,
they're all medicated.
They're all fucked up on,

3033
02:52:27.850 --> 02:52:31.450
they're on drugs.
They're,
they're heads are fucked up.
Their heads are fucked up.

3034
02:52:31.451 --> 02:52:34.750
Maybe before they were on drugs,
maybe can't even blame the,
the psychic,

3035
02:52:34.800 --> 02:52:38.700
the psychotropic drugs that they're on.
But the bottom line is they're all Scott.

3036
02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:42.970
That's the common denominator.
Mentally ill,
it's not guns.

3037
02:52:43.150 --> 02:52:45.790
There's a lot of same people with guns that never shoot anybody.

3038
02:52:46.060 --> 02:52:48.070
If it wasn't guns,
they'd find another thing.

3039
02:52:48.520 --> 02:52:51.400
I just wonder if people will eventually evolve to the point where we stopped

3040
02:52:51.401 --> 02:52:54.700
shooting each other with guns.
Stop murdering each other.
Is that possible?

3041
02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:55.600
Is that uh,

3042
02:52:55.600 --> 02:52:59.410
there's a lot less murder then there was like in the fucking 12 hundreds back

3043
02:52:59.411 --> 02:53:02.530
during the Mongol days and shit like that.
But it's still,

3044
02:53:03.070 --> 02:53:04.510
<v 2>yeah,
one little more civilized.</v>

3045
02:53:04.570 --> 02:53:08.230
I always think it has so much to do with people shooting guns.

3046
02:53:08.231 --> 02:53:11.620
Cause in the movies what you'll see is somebody will shoot somebody and then the

3047
02:53:11.690 --> 02:53:14.620
walkway and then like there'll be able to go shoot somebody else.

3048
02:53:14.621 --> 02:53:18.070
Like there isn't an instant law enforcement situation that comes in,

3049
02:53:18.071 --> 02:53:21.190
hunts them down there.
Like the one move you would Steven Seagal.

3050
02:53:21.191 --> 02:53:25.360
I think it was above the law where that one guy goes on this crime spree for

3051
02:53:25.361 --> 02:53:28.480
like a whole day and he just killing everybody and no point.

3052
02:53:28.481 --> 02:53:32.230
Do you see law enforcement anywhere?
You know,
he just moves on to the next crime,

3053
02:53:32.231 --> 02:53:33.460
moves onto the next crime.

3054
02:53:33.610 --> 02:53:37.390
Like I just feel people feel like they could shoot somebody and just easily get

3055
02:53:37.391 --> 02:53:40.180
away with it.
Um,
what,
yeah,

3056
02:53:40.210 --> 02:53:42.870
well that was my just tie right that nobody's talking about.

3057
02:53:43.120 --> 02:53:45.500
I just heard it equated above the law where the real life,

3058
02:53:46.480 --> 02:53:50.770
some people have been to gore movie like a an important point.
My point,

3059
02:53:50.771 --> 02:53:52.540
I just use it as an example,

3060
02:53:52.570 --> 02:53:57.220
meaning that I feel that a lot of people who go off on the,
and a,

3061
02:53:57.450 --> 02:53:59.500
like in Chicago,
they started shooting people.

3062
02:53:59.620 --> 02:54:02.380
I think when you watch television or even movies,

3063
02:54:02.470 --> 02:54:05.740
there's always someone who gets shoot somebody and he just walks off and his

3064
02:54:05.741 --> 02:54:08.560
life goes on.
He's never worried about the cops,
the cops.

3065
02:54:08.670 --> 02:54:10.600
I had friends in a lot of places where the cops aren't there,

3066
02:54:10.660 --> 02:54:14.170
but that's why I think it happens as much is that people don't think there's any

3067
02:54:14.171 --> 02:54:18.100
ramifications for shooting somebody as much as there really is.

3068
02:54:18.310 --> 02:54:21.670
Do you know what I'm saying?
No.
Okay.
Maybe I've just went off on a,

3069
02:54:21.700 --> 02:54:23.590
this is some weird thing as wasn't in my head.

3070
02:54:24.180 --> 02:54:26.190
<v 1>That's caffeine.
Talking to Simon.
I don't know what you're talking about.</v>

3071
02:54:26.191 --> 02:54:28.260
People know that if you get caught shooting people,
you go to jail.

3072
02:54:28.530 --> 02:54:30.900
<v 2>Yeah,
but I,
I think people think they're going to get away with it.</v>

3073
02:54:30.901 --> 02:54:32.610
That's why really who,

3074
02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:36.240
I think that's a lot of these people who shoot guns,

3075
02:54:36.420 --> 02:54:40.170
they think they're going to get away and be like mass shootings.
All,
all of them.

3076
02:54:40.260 --> 02:54:41.790
I don't think they think they're getting to get away with it.

3077
02:54:41.791 --> 02:54:44.790
I think they're on a suicide run.
Well maybe that guy's on a suicide run,

3078
02:54:44.791 --> 02:54:46.640
but these people go right,
go around.

3079
02:54:46.650 --> 02:54:48.540
They just walk up and they shoot their drug dealer.

3080
02:54:48.720 --> 02:54:52.200
They think they're going to get away with it because they know what they think.

3081
02:54:52.360 --> 02:54:54.090
I,
this is my opinion,

3082
02:54:56.070 --> 02:54:59.430
I'm staying in opinion for the,
for the purpose of discussion,

3083
02:54:59.460 --> 02:55:03.340
we're gonna bring the song because we only have a couple minutes left over.

3084
02:55:03.780 --> 02:55:04.010
It was

3085
02:55:04.010 --> 02:55:06.060
<v 1>good to be back.
I've never been in the studio.</v>

3086
