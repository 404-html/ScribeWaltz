69
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.440

<v Speaker 1>I was just one of the fight starts looking at him dog.</v>

76
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>He had like 6% body fat at this time.</v>

77
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>This guy wasn't gonna die.</v>

78
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan like this.</v>

81
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.851
<v Speaker 1>He didn't die.</v>

82
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>They killed this poor little kid.</v>

83
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>But this is really fascinating.</v>

84
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a movie that I recall where two guys warmed up like this before</v>

85
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:14.250
<v Speaker 1>a fight.</v>

86
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.083
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

87
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 1>but this is fascinating how they just don't even look at each other.</v>

88
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.961
<v Speaker 1>They move away.</v>

89
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>They go in their own little fucking world for awhile and they meet in the</v>

90
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>

91
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.853
<v Speaker 1>Like these are,</v>

92
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>this is a different thing than a fight in a movie.</v>

93
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.663
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

97
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>they agree to do it the right way.</v>

98
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Everybody warms up.</v>

99
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee catches a good sweat.</v>

100
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:37.944
<v Speaker 1>So it was chuck,</v>

101
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.800

102
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I forgot how crazy this is.</v>

103
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

104
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>this is the beginning guys.</v>

105
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.330

109
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>But this is where it starts.</v>

110
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.650
<v Speaker 1>This is where all these movies are stolen from him and they can't even steal</v>

111
00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

112
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>They don't know why they even did this.</v>

113
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

114
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee,</v>

115
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>he's getting into his fighting stance.</v>

116
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>You're the cat.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

120
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.410
<v Speaker 1>The bolts were on front leg roundhouse kicks to open up with in front lake</v>

121
00:03:07.411 --> 00:03:08.280
<v Speaker 1>sidekicks.</v>

122
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.783
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

123
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.050
<v Speaker 1>No one's hit anybody that blocking everything.</v>

124
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

125
00:03:13.831 --> 00:03:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Chuck Norris scores or the wheel kick to the face and smiles.</v>

126
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.450
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even follow up.</v>

127
00:03:20.451 --> 00:03:20.651
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

128
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:21.484
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen,</v>

129
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.070
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

130
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.940
<v Speaker 1>No ground and pound.</v>

131
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.073
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

132
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.251
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

133
00:03:25.251 --> 00:03:27.440
<v Speaker 1>Chuck is putting a beating on him.</v>

134
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

135
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.151
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

136
00:03:29.151 --> 00:03:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee grabbed the god damn chest hair.</v>

137
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair.</v>

138
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.541
<v Speaker 1>It's rude.</v>

139
00:03:32.541 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Is this is also the beginning of tank pseudo when chuck Norris split from Chi</v>

140
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Taekwondo and he could recreated this shit.</v>

141
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

142
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

143
00:03:39.351 --> 00:03:40.490
<v Speaker 1>He's a tank pseudo guy.</v>

144
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

145
00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:41.180
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

146
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he created it while supposedly he had his,</v>

147
00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:43.970
<v Speaker 1>his style.</v>

148
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was definitely a style,</v>

149
00:03:45.081 --> 00:03:46.130
<v Speaker 1>but it existed before,</v>

150
00:03:46.131 --> 00:03:47.930
<v Speaker 1>so they did two different tanks who dose,</v>

151
00:03:47.931 --> 00:03:48.201
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

152
00:03:48.201 --> 00:03:49.970
<v Speaker 1>This tank Sudo Su bog doll,</v>

153
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.770
<v Speaker 1>and I think he went the other way.</v>

154
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a superbug Dole that they all,</v>

155
00:03:53.571 --> 00:03:54.740
<v Speaker 1>they all started together,</v>

156
00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:55.760
<v Speaker 1>but he went the other way.</v>

157
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

158
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a little bit of grappling in it.</v>

159
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

160
00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.210
<v Speaker 1>They had more grappling.</v>

161
00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.691
<v Speaker 1>It didn't talk.</v>

162
00:03:59.691 --> 00:04:00.261
<v Speaker 1>When doe did,</v>

163
00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:01.100
<v Speaker 1>they had like some risks,</v>

164
00:04:01.101 --> 00:04:02.690
<v Speaker 1>locks and joint locks and stuff.</v>

165
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.201
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

166
00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:04.310
<v Speaker 1>So he gets his timing.</v>

167
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.460
<v Speaker 1>He starts talking,</v>

168
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.740
<v Speaker 1>jumping up and down and it's all fucking lights out motherfucker.</v>

169
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.620
<v Speaker 1>But the beauty of this is this is going to remind you something,</v>

170
00:04:12.621 --> 00:04:12.861
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

171
00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:14.900
<v Speaker 1>just keep watching watching.</v>

172
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

173
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it dishonorable to grab some of these chest hair and Rick had off them</v>

174
00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:20.330
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

175
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>When you were in the Colosseum,</v>

176
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.760
<v Speaker 1>whatever happens happens in this family.</v>

177
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.500
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to,</v>

178
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.251
<v Speaker 1>as long as you don't lie,</v>

179
00:04:25.251 --> 00:04:26.180
<v Speaker 1>but watch all these,</v>

180
00:04:26.181 --> 00:04:28.040
<v Speaker 1>watch all this is still slow mall.</v>

181
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.001
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows.</v>

182
00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Nothing pulled up.</v>

183
00:04:30.081 --> 00:04:32.540
<v Speaker 1>How fake is this row of they're finding and look,</v>

184
00:04:32.541 --> 00:04:34.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll thinking that brick wall was behind them.</v>

185
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.030
<v Speaker 1>They keep showing like a picture of the Coliseum and then a brick wall.</v>

186
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

187
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.960
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy shit.</v>

188
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee,</v>

189
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>they slow everything down.</v>

190
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>This is hilarious.</v>

191
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.610
<v Speaker 1>The sound that it makes every time they throw kicks this hilarious too.</v>

192
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.170
<v Speaker 1>It's 40 years ago.</v>

193
00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Look at the camera work.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Look at them.</v>

221
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.390
<v Speaker 1>John Jones style son Bruce Lee was the first oh front leg round cake to the</v>

222
00:05:53.301 --> 00:05:54.134
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

223
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Chuck Norris goes down.</v>

224
00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Had ever seen anything like this before.</v>

225
00:05:58.911 --> 00:05:59.361
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>

226
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 1>this didn't exist.</v>

227
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Never saw a fight and moved 11 and Tonya head almost blew up.</v>

228
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.481
<v Speaker 1>You left.</v>

229
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:08.670
<v Speaker 1>They're looking for somebody to say something to you,</v>

230
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>was fucked him up.</v>

231
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Including your dad.</v>

232
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 1>You didn't give a fuck when you left these movie theaters.</v>

233
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.283
<v Speaker 1>This Joe Rogan.</v>

234
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.780
<v Speaker 1>You know whether or not Bruce Lee ever competed in.</v>

235
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was like,</v>

236
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Speaker 1>the big thing about him is that he never fought like Chuck Norris was like world</v>

237
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:26.270
<v Speaker 1>middleweight kickboxing champion at one point in time.</v>

238
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee definitely did a lot of spa for sure.</v>

239
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>There's no way it could be this good.</v>

240
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.670
<v Speaker 1>The way his timing in his,</v>

241
00:06:32.671 --> 00:06:33.504
<v Speaker 1>his movement,</v>

242
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 1>his understanding of what would and wouldn't work like these in a lot of ways,</v>

243
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>even though some of it is ridiculous,</v>

244
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.850
<v Speaker 1>some of his movements are more realistic than shit you see in the movies today.</v>

245
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>The way he checks with that old bleak kick,</v>

246
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 1>the weight counters when you're moving in,</v>

247
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>it's very realistic.</v>

248
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Like these scenes like the ways fucking this dude up is a lot like the way</v>

249
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 1>someone who is at a really high levels fucking somebody up in the UFC.</v>

250
00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.980
<v Speaker 1>It's really a kind of ironic like the way he's the shit that nobody does.</v>

251
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:02.180
<v Speaker 1>This no bow.</v>

252
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 1>That's a move and a half.</v>

253
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 1>I told you in the 70s everybody swept Joe Rogan.</v>

254
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Everybody you had,</v>

255
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>you had a watch that front leg you will getting swept.</v>

256
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Once you got into range and you'd throw two punches laid out that you were</v>

257
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:15.770
<v Speaker 1>getting swept dog,</v>

258
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.120
<v Speaker 1>everybody sweat.</v>

259
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.040
<v Speaker 1>The sweep has disappeared from our society.</v>

260
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.041
<v Speaker 1>He broke his thought.</v>

261
00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:23.874
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

262
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 1>there you go with a fuck.</v>

263
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 1>You think you're dealing with.</v>

264
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I was going to be your arm or his leg.</v>

265
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.701
<v Speaker 1>That's how my hand,</v>

266
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 1>when I was out of the eight balls,</v>

267
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:33.644
<v Speaker 1>that's how I</v>

268
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.390
<v Speaker 1>check doors.</v>

269
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.711
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

270
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:37.940
<v Speaker 1>He broke his arm and his legs.</v>

271
00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Legs fucked up too.</v>

272
00:07:39.121 --> 00:07:39.954
<v Speaker 1>He fucked them up.</v>

273
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.651
<v Speaker 1>But listen,</v>

274
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

275
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.600

276
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 1>This is tremendous.</v>

281
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 1>Think about this move.</v>

282
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.261
<v Speaker 1>Look dog.</v>

283
00:07:54.261 --> 00:07:55.094
<v Speaker 1>He gets up.</v>

284
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Even though if it's a movie.</v>

285
00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:57.380

289
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.353
<v Speaker 1>but he gets up.</v>

290
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 1>This was a good fucking scene.</v>

291

295
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.950
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to throw kicks.</v>

296
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.113
<v Speaker 1>Can't get up.</v>

297
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

298
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.090
<v Speaker 1>I forget how it ends.</v>

299
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:21.923
<v Speaker 1>It he kill him.</v>

300
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.013
<v Speaker 1>Spoil alert.</v>

301
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:23.973
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

302
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful day.</v>

303
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Even got up correctly with a fucking damaged leg.</v>

304
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.521
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

305
00:08:38.521 --> 00:08:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Mother fuckers.</v>

306
00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:41.280
<v Speaker 1>This is cinematography one o one.</v>

307
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.340
<v Speaker 1>You gotta make good teen.</v>

308
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

309
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:47.911
<v Speaker 1>He killed them.</v>

310
00:08:47.911 --> 00:08:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Logins him.</v>

311
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.413
<v Speaker 1>First time ever.</v>

312
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 1>He's upset that he had to kill him.</v>

313
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Doug might might've the first gaiety never in a movie.</v>

314
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:57.481
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

315
00:08:57.481 --> 00:08:58.314
<v Speaker 1>Backing up a second,</v>

316
00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Speaker 1>I believe that was an RMN gear team,</v>

317
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>which is particularly difficult to pull up.</v>

318
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:02.761
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

319
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:03.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

320
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with this technique here.</v>

321
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Let me see back it up.</v>

322
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:07.194
<v Speaker 1>Just so here.</v>

323
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.453
<v Speaker 1>Is that an arm in?</v>

324
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's see here.</v>

325
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I can't see his other arm.</v>

326
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's a arm and gear team,</v>

327
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.220
<v Speaker 1>which I call bullshit.</v>

328
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:19.591
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

329
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:20.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not armed men is it?</v>

330
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.630
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it is.</v>

331
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.910
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to finish that one,</v>

332
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:24.061
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

333
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>You got to get up high on the neck.</v>

334
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:27.541
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

335
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 1>you got to have an unbelievable squeeze.</v>

336
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.331
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

337
00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:30.721
<v Speaker 1>What do you get?</v>

338
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

339
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

340
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Tough to tell where his arm was.</v>

341
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 1>It was if Chuck Norris had the under Hook there,</v>

342
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.293
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to,</v>

343
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:36.451
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

344
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.320
<v Speaker 1>why don't turn it off.</v>

345
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:38.101
<v Speaker 1>Watch we does.</v>

346

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.533

348
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 1>this is tremendous guys.</v>

349
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Which Steve was a fucking soldier and he wrote all these,</v>

350
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

351
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.140
<v Speaker 1>he wrote all of these though.</v>

352
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

353
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:48.520
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Dusts off his Kung Fu Jag.</v>

358
00:09:54.751 --> 00:09:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>

359
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.431
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

362
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.470
<v Speaker 1>My mom was gonna send me back to Cuba.</v>

363
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:02.350
<v Speaker 1>They sent me.</v>

364
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.790
