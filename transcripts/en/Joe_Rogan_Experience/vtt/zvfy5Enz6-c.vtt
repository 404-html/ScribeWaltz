00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.860
Folks.
It ain't about that.
It ain't about the guy who tries buying a clean car.

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:06.720
When you are dirty.
It's not his fault.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.540
It's you should figure out how to be clean.

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.440
You should figure out how to do a job that doesn't involve you walking in mud

5
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:16.800
all day and that's possible because somebody else has done it.

6
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.090
I don't buy the idea that you know the society the way it is right now.

7
00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.470
It has to be this way.
Someone's always going to have to work at Burger King.

8
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.240
Someone's always going to have to,
I don't buy that.

9
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.670
I think people are pretty fucking flexible.

10
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.880
If you look at the broad spectrum of humans and human behavior from different

11
00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:40.770
cultures all over the world,
it's pretty obvious to me that there's,

12
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.190
there's a lot of different ways that people can act.

13
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.910
We don't have to have fast food workers.
We don't,

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.300
we don't have to have people who work shit jobs.
We don't have to.

15
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.170
We just need to figure out how to restructure society so everybody somehow or

16
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:59.070
another plays apart cause something to contribute,
something to share.
I mean,

17
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:02.580
that's what a real society is supposed to be like,
I've give you some coconuts,

18
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.230
you give me some fish,
you know,

19
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:07.260
we make a deal and you do it back and forth and left and right.

20
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.170
And when there's nothing to contribute,

21
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:13.650
then you start looking or present needs to give us jobs.
We need jobs.

22
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.640
So instead of something to contribute,
just find something to do with your time.

23
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.330
And then it becomes about doing that more than it becomes about finding

24
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.410
something to contribute.

25
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.650
So society gets wrapped around becoming a part of a machine society instead of

26
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:31.860
becoming a bunch of individuals that are expressing themselves in unique ways

27
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.600
and everybody's sort of borrows and shares and sells this and you sell that.

28
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.360
And we all sort of figure out how we can contribute in a society.

29
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.570
We got sidetracked and diverted into these boxes that they call companies and

30
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:48.060
corporations and we got stuck into these containers.

31
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:52.080
They go Cuba offices and we've got forced into this system.
So our time,

32
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.280
instead of it being invested in making pottery or,

33
00:01:56.281 --> 00:02:01.281
or fixing cars or doing something where you have a passion or you have some sort

34
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:03.300
of a connection to,
instead of that,

35
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.280
you've sold your life to sit in a box and worked for a machine,

36
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.600
an uncaring machine that demands productivity,
doesn't understand you.

37
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:14.010
It doesn't want to understand you.

38
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.210
It has a bunch of very strict things in order to keep the humor at a minimum in

39
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:19.590
the office,
just in case one,

40
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:23.820
he fuckheads says some stupid sex jokes that gets them sued and you have to give

41
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:28.170
somebody $1 million.
So get it together.
And this is your life now.

42
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.650
No natural behavior.
Everybody's wearing clothes.
They don't want to,

43
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.400
where everybody is showing up and doing something they don't want to do,

44
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.100
they have no connection to.
That's the problem with our society.

45
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.150
And then what's the reward for all this stuff?
Go home,
get a big TV,
go home.

46
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:44.960
You're going to get a shiny belt buckle.
You're going to get a nice purse.

47
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:47.100
You're gonna wear shoes that you couldn't afford last week.

48
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.880
You're going to get that dream car and every week we're chasing down this new

49
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:55.290
object and every week we're trying to fill this hole in this,
this,

50
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.320
this sad shadow of a life that we've been left with after work that you work

51
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.110
eight to whatever to hours a day plus commuting and then you'll like this

52
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.950
and that's your life.
That's your real fucking life.

53
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.550
All that other stuff is not your life anymore.
All that other stuff is work.

54
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.250
And most of us have committed to that.

55
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.310
I know you've been there before and I've been there before and we understand

56
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.590
that it's trapped because we got out of it.
But for the people that are in it,

57
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.230
a lot of times they don't even understand it's a trap.

58
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.870
They just think it's a good job.
They think they got dental,

59
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.230
I'm doing really good and I got my own parking spots,
got my name on it,

60
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.090
and you're just a piece of a heartless shitty machine that makes money.

61
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.570
But don't you think you'd have to go through all that just to figure out what

62
00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:51.120
you want to do?
Because,
I mean,
I didn't think I did,

63
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.360
but I don't think you have to look.
I,
I did,

64
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.690
but I became what I became a comedian when I was 21 I was 100% convinced that I

65
00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:01.920
was going to be a stand up comedian for the rest of my life.

66
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.490
Like I didn't need the worry about what was next.
I was like,
oh,

67
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.930
this is what I'm doing.
Like I'm this,
no,

68
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.570
I don't want to do anything else like this.
This is what I'm doing.

69
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.130
Once I found it,
I was good.

70
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.840
All the jobs were just to feed myself while I was trying to make that work.

71
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:19.543
But it's,
um,

72
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.020
to get one and commit to it and have it become a part of your life becomes

73
00:04:24.021 --> 00:04:27.490
really problematic because if you're a viewer,

74
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:31.790
a dirt bag like myself who drove limos and did construction and they always,

75
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.300
you know,
almost kind of temporary jobs and a lot of people drift in and out of,

76
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.850
there was nothing expected of you.
But if you get hired by a major corporation,

77
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.740
become a big part of their,
their,
their,
you know,
their program.

78
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.070
Like let's say you're also an animator and you get a Gig.

79
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.470
Like I have a friend who,
uh,
was,
uh,

80
00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:52.400
an illustrator and he was working for Nickelodeon and he got fired and he was

81
00:04:52.401 --> 00:04:56.870
panicking and he was like,
shit,
I don't know what the fuck to do.
He's like,
ah,

82
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.030
you know,
I gotta I gotta figure out another job.

83
00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:01.310
So he started making paintings and selling his paintings.

84
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.290
It was the greatest thing that's ever happened to him.
Now he's just super,

85
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.360
his name is Todd white.
He's a super successful artist.
He makes like this,
uh,

86
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.720
kind of Martini style.
Like a cocktail was from the like,

87
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.740
like cocktail parties when the 1920s,

88
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.120
like those cool kind of cartoonish Martini glass things.

89
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.570
He's got a real specific,
distinctive style.
It's really cool.

90
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.210
These are great artists and he's also a black belt in Jujitsu.

91
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.560
I know him from a John Joc Machado's.
He's a great guy,

92
00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:33.270
but it was an opportunity for him to,

93
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.220
to lose a job and even a job that he loved as an illustrator.
But you know,

94
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.090
I'm sure you'd much rather do what he wants to do and do what's going on in his

95
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:43.490
mind.
And let's go down.
Oh,
he's really cool.

96
00:05:43.491 --> 00:05:46.520
He's bad ass and he's a great guy too.
Very cool guy.
