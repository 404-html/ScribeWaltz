8
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Only because sometimes this is the 12 sometimes it's a real change.</v>

9
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

11
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:14.191

12
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:14.900
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

13
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>You know how this one's fluid,</v>

14
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>like President Day,</v>

15
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>kids don't get that off school anymore.</v>

17
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

18
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>not funny.</v>

19
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>When we were talking about it today,</v>

20
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:21.961
<v Speaker 1>like yeah,</v>

21
00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:23.940
<v Speaker 1>cause they realize Columbus was kind of a mass murderer.</v>

22
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>No holidays changed more in ethos from the time we were a little to now.</v>

23
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Well like Santa Claus didn't become a fucking housebreaking sexual violator.</v>

24
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

25
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:34.730
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

26
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>At first it was Columbus discovered America with the Santa Maria and the Pinto,</v>

27
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:40.134
<v Speaker 1>Anna Nina.</v>

28
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>And then it was,</v>

29
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:41.581
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

30
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>he never really got to America.</v>

31
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>He was in The Bahamas or some shit.</v>

32
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.580
<v Speaker 1>And then it got to,</v>

33
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>he's a murderer and just dashing babies' heads on rocks and stories of the year.</v>

34
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.170
<v Speaker 1>And they would force people to get,</v>

35
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>bring them back gold and they would have to bring like whatever they weighed and</v>

36
00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:58.540
<v Speaker 1>gold every week.</v>

37
00:00:58.541 --> 00:00:59.101
<v Speaker 1>And if they didn't,</v>

38
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:00.450
<v Speaker 1>they'd cut one of their arms off.</v>

39
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

40
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>So they do it to a couple people.</v>

41
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>They cut their arm off and everyone's screaming.</v>

42
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>And so the rest of them just scramble and go and get that gold.</v>

43
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.651
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

44
00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:09.484
<v Speaker 1>they there.</v>

45
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the last time I was on,</v>

46
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>we talked about Columbus cause you called him an original gangster.</v>

47
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>He really was.</v>

48
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Well I think everybody was gangster back then.</v>

49
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Crown couldn't wait.</v>

50
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.230
<v Speaker 2>It was when he got back after the first one.</v>

51
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 2>It took a long time.</v>

52
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 2>The other guy who hated him,</v>

53
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 2>who was also co captain of the expedition died for much to his good fortune.</v>

54
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 2>He was in another boat,</v>

55
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.480
<v Speaker 2>isn't the Nina and uh,</v>

56
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.300
<v Speaker 2>so Columbus got back after much ado.</v>

57
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

58
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Did you go to Portugal?</v>

59
00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:37.171
<v Speaker 2>He almost crashed.</v>

60
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Landed the whole fucking enchilada.</v>

61
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 2>When he finally got to Ferdinand and Isabella,</v>

62
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 2>he had enough stuff with him from that first journey.</v>

63
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.061
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

64
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:48.630
<v Speaker 2>he left like 40 guys there because the Santa Maria ran aground and there was</v>

65
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 2>fucking scuppered.</v>

66
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 2>So he just left a bunch of fucking guys in the Caribbean.</v>

67
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 2>And they died.</v>

68
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 2>They got in fights with the Indians and died when he got back to Spain and</v>

69
00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:57.031
<v Speaker 2>finally,</v>

70
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 2>finally got to front in front of the king and Queen.</v>

71
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.740
<v Speaker 2>He had a cut,</v>

72
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.681
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

74
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 2>10 Indians and some parents and some gold and some native shit.</v>

75
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.263
<v Speaker 2>And they went,</v>

76
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

77
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:08.454
<v Speaker 2>their minds are blown.</v>

78
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.710
<v Speaker 2>No one knew there was another world right now.</v>

79
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

80
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 2>people knew there was another world,</v>

81
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't know that you could go find a new one like that.</v>

82
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Like he came back with people from another place who spoke Airwalk and had</v>

83
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 2>fucking monkeys.</v>

84
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is this?</v>

85
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Here's a bunch of men,</v>

86
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 2>10 times more money,</v>

87
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 2>a bunch more boats.</v>

88
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.670
<v Speaker 2>The second expedition was hugely funded.</v>

89
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Anyone ever with horses cannons,</v>

90
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 2>the whole fucking and shit.</v>

91
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

92
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 2>The first one was like,</v>

93
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 2>when you send your friend a fucking home depot,</v>

94
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:37.330
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

95
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 2>here's my car.</v>

96
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 2>Don't use the blinker.</v>

97
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

98
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

99
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 2>He barely made it there in backed on the first one and yes,</v>

100
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:46.740
<v Speaker 2>he did do all those horrible things to the Indians.</v>

101
00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 2>He was no notion of them as people.</v>

102
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 2>He was a strict Catholic.</v>

103
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 2>He believed that he had been singled out by God.</v>

104
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Just the idea of custody peoples' arms off cause they didn't bring enough and</v>

105
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>doing it in front</v>

106
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.843
<v Speaker 2>of their family.</v>

107
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 2>If he didn't produce precious goods for the Spanish crown,</v>

108
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 2>that he wasn't going to keep getting funded.</v>

109
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 2>When he went back and that was the driving to keep going and pushing through to</v>

110
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Asia was what he was after to find China cause he knew there'd be ivory and</v>

111
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 2>pearls and all that Shite toggle.</v>

112
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 2>But look what he look at it on the other hand,</v>

113
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 2>within 20 or 30 years of Columbus,</v>

114
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 2>now they're in Mexico and within another hundred years without the largest</v>

115
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 2>silver mine in the world,</v>

116
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 2>that giant mountain of silver that all of the silver of Asia for 400 years came</v>

117
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 2>from because of the Spanish trade routes between China and shit.</v>

118
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.400
<v Speaker 2>They reduced a mountain of silver in Mexico and some in South America too.</v>

119
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 2>And use the Indians to fucking do it on the mountain of silver.</v>

120
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

121
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 2>there's a book called 1493,</v>

146
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Why they don't tell you all the fun stuff in the game of Thrones.</v>

147
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

148
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Big giant warrior.</v>

149
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Imagine what a bad acid or you had to be to be on that fucking mission.</v>

150
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.440
<v Speaker 2>And Cortez burned the boats and took a vote with everybody and said,</v>

151
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 2>you want to go back or not?</v>

152
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.041
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

153
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:39.371
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

154
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:39.551
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

155
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 2>this is how it's going to go.</v>

156
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.280
<v Speaker 2>We know where the capital of the [inaudible],</v>

157
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.020
<v Speaker 2>this is our mission and let's look,</v>

158
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 2>and they got all the Indians along the way and that's how they did it.</v>

159
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 2>And they burned the boats.</v>

160
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't go back.</v>

161
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

162
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 2>But according to one book I read by Bernal Diaz,</v>

163
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 2>who was the last survivor of that mission,</v>

164
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.960
<v Speaker 2>he landed up in like Honduras or whatever,</v>

165
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 2>the little ranch when he was old.</v>

166
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 2>He writes the forward,</v>

167
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm old and I'm blind now,</v>

168
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to tell you what the fuck happened when on the mission with Cortez</v>

169
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 2>and he'd been on a previous one with another conquistador and then he says,</v>

170
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 2>he didn't just say we're burning the boats.</v>

171
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 2>We took a vote.</v>

172
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

173
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Captain General Cortez said to the boys,</v>

174
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 2>parrot is you can go back to Cuba where they were living or you can go back to</v>

175
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:25.741
<v Speaker 2>span where you got nothing horsch gold and fucking glory and to State Lawn and</v>

176
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 2>you may die and they may eat.</v>

177
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 2>You eat your heart out.</v>

178
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 2>It's so such an ability to take risks back then.</v>

179
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.860
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty extraordinary.</v>

180
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:39.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean the genocide and the Indians is of course the disgusting part.</v>

181
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 2>But I mean the Aztecs did have a organized army and you know,</v>

182
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:43.744
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>

183
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a hundred Spanish guys.</v>

184
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.090
<v Speaker 2>They had tens of thousands of Indians in their army when they finally laid the</v>

185
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.000
<v Speaker 2>big battle out,</v>

186
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Columbus on the other hand just Kinda maraud around the Caribbean and tried to</v>

187
00:05:56.231 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 2>get these poor Indians who had no gold to give him gold and he was in the wrong</v>

188
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:01.161
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

189
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:01.521

194
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.060

195
00:06:13.061 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 2>stuff and that they didn't have any gold there.</v>

196
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 2>So they were weighing little earrings and nose rings and Shit and he'd be like,</v>

197
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.603
<v Speaker 2>that was it though.</v>

198

205
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 2>it's not important to us.</v>

206
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:32.564
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

207
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 2>and he just went as soon as he saw any goal.</v>

208
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 2>That was the end of that.</v>

209
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:38.360
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>

<v Speaker 2>how do they have this?</v>

211
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Obviously they have that one account from Cortez you were talking about from one</v>

212
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 2>of the people that,</v>

213
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.451
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

214
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:46.660
<v Speaker 2>there's loads of accounts of Cortez cause there's fryers,</v>

215
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 2>the row.</v>

216
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 2>How do they have these accounts?</v>

217
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

218
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Columbus wrote a diary and a guy's on his ship wrote diaries and a,</v>

219
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.400
<v Speaker 2>there's a famous uh,</v>

220
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.550
<v Speaker 2>trees to as the,</v>

221
00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 2>the sort of the conscience of the new world who decried the genocide against the</v>

222
00:06:58.401 --> 00:06:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Indians from the very beginning.</v>

223
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 2>And the Spanish kept meticulous records and there's a giant library in Seville</v>

224
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 2>called the library of the indies where all of the Caucasians Adores fucking</v>

225
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 2>documents are collated and captain.</v>

226
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:11.324
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

227
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.010
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>

228
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.280
<v Speaker 2>There are legal society.</v>

229
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 2>So you brought a priest with you.</v>

230
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:16.520
<v Speaker 2>You bought a notary with you,</v>

231
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 2>you brought lawyers with you,</v>

232
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 2>you brought generals with you.</v>

233
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:20.060
<v Speaker 2>You brought a doctor,</v>

234
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 2>you wrote shit down.</v>

235
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:22.304
<v Speaker 2>You fucking,</v>

236
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.570
<v Speaker 2>when you took over a town,</v>

237
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:26.480
<v Speaker 2>you wrote a sign and posted a crucifix sense.</v>

238
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.510
<v Speaker 2>So how much did you agree to the Indians who can't understand you,</v>

239
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 2>that you are taking over their town in the name of the King of Spain and Chen?</v>

240
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 2>How much bullshit,</v>

241
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

242
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

243
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:36.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

244
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.480
<v Speaker 2>so when,</v>

245
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.100
<v Speaker 2>when they would tell their version of the events,</v>

246
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 2>how much of it was bullshit histories all spinning,</v>

247
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:42.740
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

248
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't think all of it's bullshit because there's a lot of real also Indians</v>

249
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:49.610
<v Speaker 2>wrote accounts later who lurks within a generation.</v>

250
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Obviously there's Mexicans,</v>

251
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.810
<v Speaker 2>which are the marriage of Indians and,</v>

252
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:55.671
<v Speaker 2>and Spanish,</v>

253
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

254
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.920
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

255
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 2>within a generation,</v>

256
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 2>all of the Aztec noble is of which there were lots and all the nobles in Mexico</v>

257
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 2>from the Indian tribes married into rich,</v>

258
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

259
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:08.430
<v Speaker 2>married into Spanish family.</v>

260
00:08:08.431 --> 00:08:13.431
<v Speaker 2>So they were raised as rich people who spoke Spanish now and they were able to</v>

261
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 2>tell their stories as well.</v>

262
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of first person accounts by the explorers.</v>

263
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Cabeza de Vaca kept a diary in,</v>

264
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean Columbus is is great because it's so self serving,</v>

265
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

266
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.430
<v Speaker 2>he'll knits whole portions of the journey and he doesn't mention some of the</v>

267
00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:30.060
<v Speaker 2>ratty shitty did and the radish,</v>

268
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 2>it was all ratted out by priests,</v>

269
00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:31.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

270
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

271
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 2>And then later expeditions within by the second expedition,</v>

272
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:39.710
<v Speaker 2>guys were mutinying on him and and fucking going back to Spain and ratting on</v>

273
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 2>him that he was a terrible and competent fucking commander and that he had,</v>

274
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 2>once they got on land,</v>

275
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:46.450
<v Speaker 2>he was useless and he didn't know how to handle it.</v>

276
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 2>The Indians and there was always in her violence with the cruise killing each</v>

277
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 2>other and choosing sides and hiding on different parts of the island from each</v>

278
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 2>other and not doing what he asked him to do.</v>

279
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 2>He was a terrible commander on the sea.</v>

280
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 2>The greatest thing you can say about Columbus's,</v>

281
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:02.420
<v Speaker 2>he's an extraordinary navigator.</v>

282
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 2>He knew that there was going to be a trade wind and he caught it.</v>

283
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 2>Having had some of that knowledge.</v>

284
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 2>He knew that if he went down and got it,</v>

285
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 2>he could come and get one back.</v>

286
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 2>And I think he guessed that he surmised lottery knew from other sailors and shit</v>

287
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:19.260
<v Speaker 2>that you wouldn't actually get lost in die.</v>

288
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.920
<v Speaker 2>You could come back to Europe from wherever you were going in Asia.</v>

289
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.470
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't have a,</v>

290
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.160
<v Speaker 2>a telescope.</v>

291
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.080
<v Speaker 2>This is previous to the telescope.</v>

292
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:33.081
<v Speaker 2>So He is dead reckoning and it was terrible with instruments.</v>

293
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.410
<v Speaker 2>Like he had an astro lab and he had a sexton but he couldn't fucking use them</v>

294
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

295
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 2>So all of his reckonings in the book,</v>

296
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Andy kept two separate notebooks.</v>

297
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.780
<v Speaker 2>One with his navigational charts and another with fake ones in case anybody</v>

298
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 2>caught him cause he didn't want anybody copying is root cause he thought he was</v>

299
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:54.810
<v Speaker 2>going to have the monopoly on going to the new world.</v>

300
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 2>So within of course,</v>

301
00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 2>20 years,</v>

302
00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:58.470
<v Speaker 2>within,</v>

303
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.640
<v Speaker 2>within four years,</v>

304
00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:02.220
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole bunch of other Spanish vowels coming over and you know,</v>

305
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.840
<v Speaker 2>within 10 years it's all over those growing levels.</v>

306
00:10:05.841 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 2>So when he first starts writing it down,</v>

307
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:08.610
<v Speaker 2>you said that he's writing,</v>

308
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:09.990
<v Speaker 2>he's not using instruments.</v>

309
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:10.830
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

310
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.371
<v Speaker 2>he could,</v>

311
00:10:11.371 --> 00:10:12.540
<v Speaker 2>he had instruments,</v>

312
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:13.680
<v Speaker 2>they're crappy.</v>

313
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.690
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have any idea of longitude.</v>

314
00:10:18.691 --> 00:10:19.524
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

315
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Longitude was kind of a free flowing affair.</v>

316
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.450
<v Speaker 2>If you had shit you could focus on like stars or bodies of our islands or</v>

317
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 2>whatever the you could now the gate,</v>

318
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 2>which is why those maps of the world always seemed so small right from then.</v>

319
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

320
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:40.340
<v Speaker 2>so he had to recommend by currents and winds and the color of the water,</v>

321
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.443
<v Speaker 2>how the water,</v>

322
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.810
<v Speaker 2>the salinity of the water tested.</v>

323
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 2>They had a rope with thumbs on it,</v>

324
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:51.300
<v Speaker 2>marked in knots and that take soundings to see how fucking deep the sea was.</v>

325
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:54.780
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden when they got near and the crew was having a heart attack,</v>

326
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:57.060
<v Speaker 2>cause they'd been out for a couple months and it's true.</v>

327
00:10:57.061 --> 00:10:57.894
<v Speaker 2>The crew was like,</v>

328
00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

329
00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.753
<v Speaker 2>we're going to die.</v>

330
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.750
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

331
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:01.740
<v Speaker 2>calm the fuck down.</v>

332
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.660
<v Speaker 2>And the next day,</v>

333
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:04.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

334
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.990
<v Speaker 2>clearly something a human had made,</v>

335
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:10.460
<v Speaker 2>like a carved paddle hit the boat and they pulled it out.</v>

336
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:11.294
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>

337
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.283
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

338
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.730
<v Speaker 2>there's something over there and then the next day a bunch of branches and shit</v>

339
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.790
<v Speaker 2>and then birds and when there's birds and branches,</v>

340
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:23.310
<v Speaker 2>there's fucking islands and they knew.</v>

341
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Then the men started to get hip to the fact that he wasn't wrong.</v>

342
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.650
<v Speaker 2>There was something over there.</v>

343
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:29.940
<v Speaker 2>And then of course he,</v>

344
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.180
<v Speaker 2>he said whoever sees the island first gets a prize and the guy in the middle of</v>

345
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.990
<v Speaker 2>the night saw the lights and he said when they got up in the day,</v>

346
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I saw him last night.</v>

347
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.633
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

348
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:40.860
<v Speaker 2>shouted his crew.</v>

349
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.270
<v Speaker 2>So why not her loved him.</v>

350
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.590
<v Speaker 2>What lights did he see?</v>

351
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.731
<v Speaker 2>Fires to?</v>

352
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Indians were burning.</v>

353
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

354
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:48.443
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>

355
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:48.721
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

356
00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:49.130
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

357
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.963
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

358
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:50.341
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

359
00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird to think of their gear navies.</v>

360
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.220
<v Speaker 2>No rifles on the first expedition.</v>

361
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a couple of,</v>

362
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.800
<v Speaker 2>not rifles like Arca buses that you lit a fuse and put it in a breach and you</v>

363
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:02.071
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

364
00:12:02.071 --> 00:12:03.610
<v Speaker 2>he had to pack it down,</v>

365
00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:04.450
<v Speaker 2>pack it down with the ball.</v>

366
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.860
<v Speaker 2>A lot of crossbows,</v>

367
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.860
<v Speaker 2>a few crossbows that was considered real high tact.</v>

368
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Have those with you.</v>

369
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.750
<v Speaker 2>That was a big deal to have like an organized group of Cross Bowman because an</v>

370
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:17.310
<v Speaker 2>organized group across go Bowman could wipe out lots of people out.</v>

371
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 2>We're very accurate.</v>

372
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 2>The armor thing never worked out for them with all the conquistadores.</v>

373
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Within a few weeks they'd all fucking started wearing the Indians armor because</v>

374
00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:26.554
<v Speaker 2>it's too hot.</v>

375
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

376
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.203
<v Speaker 2>Too much stuff.</v>

377
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.770
<v Speaker 2>They were metal and metal rots in the jungle and shitness but the Indians had</v>

378
00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:34.780
<v Speaker 2>fabulous cotton textiles that made,</v>

379
00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>

380
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

381
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:37.970
<v Speaker 1>so Columbus is,</v>

382
00:12:37.971 --> 00:12:38.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

383
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.530
<v Speaker 1>his journals,</v>

384
00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.820
<v Speaker 1>they were all his own way of measuring the salinity,</v>

385
00:12:43.821 --> 00:12:46.430
<v Speaker 1>his own way of measuring the color of the water.</v>

386
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.280
<v Speaker 1>So he would just describe that like that's how he knew</v>

387
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.820
<v Speaker 2>he'd been at sea since he was a teenager.</v>

388
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Genewiz tended to go to ca cause they were slave traders and there was always a</v>

389
00:12:56.361 --> 00:12:57.860
<v Speaker 2>tradition of slavery in Genoa,</v>

390
00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.640
<v Speaker 2>which is why he didn't perceive the Indians,</v>

391
00:12:59.641 --> 00:13:02.930
<v Speaker 2>just people as much as his first thing he wrote back was like,</v>

392
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I think we found a bunch of slaves here.</v>

393
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:05.990
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

394
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

395
00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.330
<v Speaker 2>we can use these people to build stuff.</v>

396
00:13:08.331 --> 00:13:12.950
<v Speaker 2>And then of course their temperament was not that way and he didn't manage any</v>

397
00:13:12.951 --> 00:13:13.701
<v Speaker 2>of the situations.</v>

398
00:13:13.701 --> 00:13:14.091
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

399
00:13:14.091 --> 00:13:18.440
<v Speaker 2>And he betrayed everybody and that's why it all went so horribly shit.</v>

400
00:13:18.441 --> 00:13:19.910
<v Speaker 2>And all those Indians are dead.</v>

401
00:13:19.911 --> 00:13:21.500
<v Speaker 2>There's no Caribbean Indians.</v>

402
00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.030
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird</v>

403
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.970
<v Speaker 1>when you stop and think about what a short amount of time ago that was.</v>

404
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

405
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.060
<v Speaker 1>So short,</v>

406
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Jesus was nothing.</v>

407
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:29.803
<v Speaker 1>Two years.</v>

408
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.120
<v Speaker 1>500 years seems like a long time for one person.</v>

409
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.600
<v Speaker 1>But once you've been alive for a little while and like you're in your forties</v>

410
00:13:36.601 --> 00:13:37.530
<v Speaker 1>and you start looking at you going,</v>

411
00:13:37.531 --> 00:13:37.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

412
00:13:37.711 --> 00:13:38.820
<v Speaker 1>that didn't take that long.</v>

413
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.410
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like he moved pretty quick.</v>

414
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.030
<v Speaker 1>How many of these are left?</v>

415
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.950
<v Speaker 1>How many of them do you get in the life?</v>

416
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.500
<v Speaker 1>My mother was 94 when she passed away.</v>

417
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Five of those born in 1919 yeah.</v>

418
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.251
<v Speaker 1>Five lives.</v>

419
00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:51.001
<v Speaker 1>Birth to death.</v>

420
00:13:51.001 --> 00:13:54.570
<v Speaker 1>And you're dealing with like the most horrible atrocities that you know we have</v>

421
00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:55.520
<v Speaker 1>like on record,</v>

422
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.950
<v Speaker 1>there was times when my mother was born,</v>

423
00:13:58.951 --> 00:13:59.610
<v Speaker 1>there was no,</v>

424
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.181
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird.</v>

425
00:14:00.181 --> 00:14:00.781
<v Speaker 1>Radio Sir,</v>

426
00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:01.710
<v Speaker 1>growing up in Columbus,</v>

427
00:14:01.711 --> 00:14:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Ohio because that's named after Christopher Columbus.</v>

428
00:14:04.201 --> 00:14:06.300
<v Speaker 1>And there's all these fucking statues everywhere,</v>

429
00:14:06.301 --> 00:14:10.680
<v Speaker 1>like just like celebrating this man and you grew up in school celebrating and</v>

430
00:14:10.681 --> 00:14:11.670
<v Speaker 1>it's just weird now.</v>

431
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Well we looked at men and not at any of reality.</v>

432
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:16.443
<v Speaker 2>Keep talking.</v>

433
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:17.363
<v Speaker 2>Should we?</v>

434
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:17.681
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

435
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:17.951
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

436
00:14:17.951 --> 00:14:18.880
<v Speaker 2>We can adjourn if you like.</v>

437
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.351
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

438
00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:20.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

439
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:21.910
<v Speaker 2>And if you get to Seville,</v>

440
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.170
<v Speaker 2>there's a giant statue of him.</v>

441
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

442
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.560
<v Speaker 2>and there's one in Barcelona chair looking out over the scene now.</v>

443
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:33.030
<v Speaker 2>And then the statue in Seville is in the cathedral and he's being carried in a</v>

444
00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:34.270
<v Speaker 2>litter,</v>

445
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:34.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

446
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:39.780
<v Speaker 2>by four Indians from different tribes and they're wearing their Indian garb.</v>

447
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.530
<v Speaker 2>And he's in a big brass that are like that.</v>

448
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 2>And his foot is rubbed completely shiny,</v>

449
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.590
<v Speaker 2>cause it's good luck to rub club foot in Seville was on a river.</v>

450
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.280
<v Speaker 2>And every year when the,</v>

451
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.140
<v Speaker 2>the fleet would come back to treasure fleet from the new world,</v>

452
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 2>they'd be ladened down like almost to the water line with fucking gold and</v>

453
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:03.740
<v Speaker 2>precious goods and people and stuff.</v>

454
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 2>And they'd come up the river and there was a chain across the river and Sybil.</v>

455
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:09.440
<v Speaker 2>And they'd pull the chain out.</v>

456
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:10.460
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

457
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.080
<v Speaker 2>and it's sail up the river.</v>

458
00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:15.340
<v Speaker 2>And that was a big event every year because when the treasure fleet came to</v>

459
00:15:15.341 --> 00:15:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Oculus,</v>

460
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.520
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

461
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 2>and of course Spanish people got none of that money.</v>

462
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Just the crown.</v>

463
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.830
<v Speaker 2>And then what did they do?</v>

464
00:15:20.831 --> 00:15:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Wage war against the French and the hall,</v>

465
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.690
<v Speaker 2>the Dutch and the English for fucking 300 years and blew all the money.</v>

466
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.840
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

467
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.790
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking human being.</v>
