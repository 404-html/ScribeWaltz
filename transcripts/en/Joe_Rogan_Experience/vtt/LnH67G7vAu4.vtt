<v Speaker 1>I like to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you want me to take them off?</v>

12
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.274
<v Speaker 1>You do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please explain to the people listening </v>

13
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>what exactly this jacket is because some</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks are not watching.</v>

14
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I've lots of friends in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>military.</v>

15
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>It's the best I'm forces in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Merck should be very happy about it.</v>

16
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's occasionally,</v>

17
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:40.284
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wandered into the commissary and </v>

18
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:41.191
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>pick up a few little few little items </v>
<v Speaker 1>and adjusted of course,</v>

20
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:45.894
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>she's tufts very boxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very boxy.</v>

22
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>So I took it to a nice Taylor in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.380
<v Speaker 1>in Beverly Hills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>had the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the sleeves pulled down.</v>

25
00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:53.364
<v Speaker 1>It's very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like some sort of a navy jacket or </v>

26
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:56.500
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that exactly?</v>

27
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>It's an army dress jacket actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this was an air force place.</v>

28
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Is that a military appropriation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to,</v>

29
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>is that the stolen valor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you allowed to other no,</v>

30
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:05.191
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

31
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's any stolen valor.</v>

32
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>If you're like misrepresenting their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember though I forces and you know,</v>

33
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>if I had like batches on or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that would be bad.</v>

34
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I like to think of this more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a source of fashionable amash.</v>

35
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a respectful gesture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

36
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Those stolen valor dudes are very odd </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they get caught.</v>

38
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.073
<v Speaker 1>We've seen a lot of those videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a disturbing little mental </v>

39
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>illness to pretend to be a war hero.</v>

40
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what's interesting,</v>

41
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>they always get caught out because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of very clever but not very</v>

42
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:34.284
<v Speaker 1>clever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they'll do is they will think </v>

43
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>that they've got all the badges right </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll kind of like,</v>

44
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.903
<v Speaker 1>they'll have a friend who sort of lets </v>
<v Speaker 1>them into the commissary so they can go </v>

45
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>and pick up these badges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

46
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 1>pretend that part of the tank unit or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

47
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll get something slightly wrong</v>

48
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>because they're not serving and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a superior officer.</v>

49
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:49.490
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

50
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:50.754
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just getting the middle of </v>

52
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

53
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>for all of their weird autistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessions about the,</v>

54
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>

55
00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>getting all of the uniform stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

56
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.803
<v Speaker 1>There are people out there on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet who are vets who know the </v>

57
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they were these amazing wars.</v>

58
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.940
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a name for them in Britain.</v>

59
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>We called them waltz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Walter Mitty is,</v>

60
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>who's Walter Mitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

61
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Walter Mitty is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that name.</v>

62
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the most recently there was a </v>

63
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>

64
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 1>was it Matt Damon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

65
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.241
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

66
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:18.721
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

67
00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just,</v>

68
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.940
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

69
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>it's become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a novel on a novel and a movie in,</v>

70
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>it's become just a name in culture for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who pretend to be somebody else.</v>

71
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>The secret life of Walter Mitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

72
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

73
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:31.290
<v Speaker 1>So in the army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call them walt's people who pretend</v>

74
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.153
<v Speaker 1>to be vets or pretending to be sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>service officer serving personnel who </v>

75
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>are not is a very bizarre mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>

76
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Eds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

77
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so uncomfortable watching them get </v>

78
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:43.330
<v Speaker 1>called out to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

79
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.163
<v Speaker 1>there was one guy that I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These marines cornered them and they </v>

80
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>started asking him questions and start </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling apart.</v>

81
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.023
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

82
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

83
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Speaker 1>it's so awkward and clingy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I live for those moments in life.</v>

84
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.620
<v Speaker 1>They are fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

85
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>so speaking of awkward and Cringey,</v>

86
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is going on with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

87
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

88
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm so happy for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

89
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:06.994
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

90
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michelle Obama said something terrible.</v>

91
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.663
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was proud of my country the first for </v>

92
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 2>the first time or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

93
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 2>about something trivial and ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I found distressing.</v>

94
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want to say that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not true,</v>

95
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.700
<v Speaker 2>but I did suddenly think there might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>hope for your,</v>

96
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 2>after all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be hope,</v>

97
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 2>particularly for the best country in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>

98
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.500
<v Speaker 2>which is England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

99
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.120
<v Speaker 2>and the best sort of nation in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

100
00:03:26.121 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 2>the United Kingdom finally unshackled </v>
<v Speaker 2>from this hellish,</v>

101
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.273
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this hellish continent on a suicide </v>

102
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 2>mission into is the migration and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic doom.</v>

103
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.703
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UK has got a chance to prove that </v>

104
00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 2>it's better than all that and it can </v>
<v Speaker 2>reopen,</v>

105
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better trade relationships with Asia,</v>

106
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 2>with India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with America can re,</v>

107
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reassess,</v>

108
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 2>renegotiate its relationship with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the countries around it.</v>

109
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.583
<v Speaker 2>The European project for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know a lot of Americans have </v>

110
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 2>sort of believed what they've read about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coverage,</v>

111
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

112
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 2>from the media on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm definitely in the Brexit camp.</v>

113
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fantastic and not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>economically,</v>

114
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.833
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I think things will bounce back </v>

115
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 2>and Britain will be better than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

116
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 2>but culturally and it's readable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what's so essential.</v>

117
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 2>Britain has a slightly different </v>
<v Speaker 2>national characters.</v>

118
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 2>The rest of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never really fit.</v>

119
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.343
<v Speaker 2>And I think Britain now has an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to save itself from the </v>

120
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:15.724
<v Speaker 2>suicidal open borders policies of Angela</v>
<v Speaker 2>Merkel from the inevitable decline and </v>

121
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 2>fall of Europe is a continent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally Britain's got a chance now and</v>

122
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 2>it didn't have a chance as part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>

123
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 2>And Merkel is the one who when those </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks were going on in Germany during,</v>

124
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Year's Eve,</v>

125
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 2>where the Islamic guys are grabbing all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those girls,</v>

126
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:35.763
<v Speaker 2>her advice was for them to dress </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently than stay within arm's </v>

127
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 2>length.</v>

128
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.093
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in feminism we call this victim blaming </v>

129
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.223
<v Speaker 2>when you tell people that they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that contributed toward their </v>

130
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 2>rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

131
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 2>but of course in the hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppression and victim hood,</v>

132
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 2>according to progressive's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims rank higher than women.</v>

133
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Muslims rank higher than anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

134
00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

135
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 2>it's because of the wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

136
00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:58.234
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because they hate the west as much </v>

137
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:00.514
<v Speaker 2>as feminists too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you think it has something to do </v>

138
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 2>with the fact that we invaded Iraq and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan and people feel a little bit</v>

139
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 2>guilty about the fact that a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have died?</v>

140
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.373
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white guilt has driven all of the worst </v>

141
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 2>things that have happened in Weston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

142
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:13.204
<v Speaker 2>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the worst things that have happened </v>

143
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 2>in western culture in the last 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>have all been driven by white guilt,</v>

144
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:18.190
<v Speaker 2>feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter the whole lot.</v>

145
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.121
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

146
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are not good reasons.</v>

147
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Feminism is driven by white guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

148
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've a theory about this.</v>

149
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.750
<v Speaker 2>It's very straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the nineties we had Marilyn Manson,</v>

150
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 2>we had Trent Reznor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a nirvana and people were cutting</v>

151
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

152
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.581
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

153
00:05:34.581 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 2>the emo thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I was growing,</v>

154
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean I didn't obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when people were growing up,</v>

155
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:41.120
<v Speaker 2>they had an outlet for all of that sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of repressed rage and self loathing.</v>

156
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids these days don't have that.</v>

157
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.370
<v Speaker 2>And the inevitable result of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice.</v>

158
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 2>What they do instead is they sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hang on to this as a protracted self.</v>

159
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Hatred is protracted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self harm,</v>

160
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:50.914
<v Speaker 2>social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go out into the world and hurt </v>

161
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 2>people who look like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these awful,</v>

162
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:55.834
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle class white feminist women just </v>

163
00:05:57.111 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>want to hurt other</v>

164
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 1>middle class white people because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like,</v>

165
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is terrible.</v>

166
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.433
<v Speaker 1>it's a very weird phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this social justice thing and I think </v>

168
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 1>it's mainly driven by self loathing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

169
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.300
<v Speaker 1>once you understand that their behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a lot more,</v>

170
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>it makes a lot more sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

171
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>you start to understand why they are as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

172
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of heat is definitely and </v>
<v Speaker 1>self-loathing and it,</v>

173
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.843
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an opportunity today that they </v>

174
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.034
<v Speaker 1>have that they never had before to </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize and find likeminded folks and </v>

175
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>get together and form of the crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

176
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>fully gangs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

177
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 1>they all do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they bully gangs and you know you,</v>

178
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 1>when you start to understand that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a sort of psychosis,</v>

179
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>when you start to understand this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like mental illness,</v>

180
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.343
<v Speaker 1>this is something that they should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>got out of the systems when they were </v>

181
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:38.324
<v Speaker 1>teens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't because they had no </v>

182
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>culture to help them.</v>

183
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.460
<v Speaker 1>They know I grew up on Marilyn Manson </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Nirvana.</v>

184
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:44.294
<v Speaker 1>These kids grow up on like Selena Gomez </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Justin Bieber and that sort of like </v>

185
00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>flat anodyne eternally fundless grinning</v>
<v Speaker 1>garbage.</v>

186
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.613
<v Speaker 1>They don't ever get it out of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems and now you have 35 year old </v>

187
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>bitter bastards working for buzzfeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still,</v>

188
00:06:57.321 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Speaker 1>it's got to go somewhere and where does </v>
<v Speaker 1>it go?</v>

189
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 1>It goes into social justice and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happened.</v>

190
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of them?</v>

191
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:05.654
<v Speaker 1>Some of them genuinely feel like this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a unique opportunity to write some of </v>

192
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 1>the wrongs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that our culture is sort of encouraged.</v>

193
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.920
<v Speaker 1>What is our culture or intimate sexism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism.</v>

194
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Nobody says there's no sexism and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism in this,</v>

195
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 1>in this country either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in this country.</v>

196
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.513
<v Speaker 1>No serious person says that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody really believes that I'm </v>

197
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:29.510
<v Speaker 1>squeaking in my chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't anything else.</v>

198
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Nobody really believes that.</v>

199
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody says it.</v>

200
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in,</v>

201
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.730
<v Speaker 1>you know where you live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that if at one day,</v>

202
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:40.250
<v Speaker 1>but you know you live in the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>country in the world.</v>

203
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.800
<v Speaker 1>It is a country driven by democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>

204
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:43.634
<v Speaker 1>property rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism and all of those western </v>

205
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The values on which,</v>

206
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:47.684
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech and the second </v>

207
00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:49.334
<v Speaker 1>amendment to all of those things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>went into building America and making </v>

208
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:52.454
<v Speaker 1>America wonderful are exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are responsible for women </v>

209
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.250
<v Speaker 1>having the vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having access to the same opportunity,</v>

210
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:00.110
<v Speaker 1>the same opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same access to institutions,</v>

211
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 1>to education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the workplace,</v>

212
00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:02.660
<v Speaker 1>having equal pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course they do.</v>

213
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.713
<v Speaker 1>You know it giving gay people rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the places in the world where </v>

214
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:07.670
<v Speaker 1>gay people have rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are modern,</v>

215
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:11.000
<v Speaker 1>western liberal capitalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalist democracies or the left hates</v>

216
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.750
<v Speaker 1>all of those things and hates the West </v>
<v Speaker 1>for precisely that,</v>

217
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:14.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for size of the reasons that the West </v>

218
00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>has been nice to them.</v>

219
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.233
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and frankly they don't go after this </v>

220
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.420
<v Speaker 1>assist hat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white patriarchy.</v>

221
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:21.254
<v Speaker 1>Well the patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the western capitalist </v>

222
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Patriarchy is the only people that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

223
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.040
<v Speaker 1>the only people who like the gaze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only people who like,</v>

224
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blacks and women,</v>

225
00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:29.864
<v Speaker 1>all the rest of it go anywhere else in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and it is not a particularly </v>

226
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.283
<v Speaker 1>pretty situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a particularly happy place to be if </v>

227
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:38.600
<v Speaker 1>you're not born into the right group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in America,</v>

228
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.640
<v Speaker 1>you can pretty much do say and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want.</v>

229
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are threats to that and I,</v>

230
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.500
<v Speaker 1>my college tourist is hoping to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>head off some of those,</v>

231
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.990
<v Speaker 1>those threats brewing in American </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>

232
00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 1>but these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are these people really hating on?</v>

233
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.950
<v Speaker 1>They live in the best country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most equal country,</v>

234
00:08:51.951 --> 00:08:54.350
<v Speaker 1>the greatest country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country with the most liberal values</v>

235
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 1>anywhere on the planet and they're still</v>
<v Speaker 1>not happy.</v>

236
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>We'll fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

237
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 1>There are obviously things left to fix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's saying there's no sexism,</v>

238
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 1>no racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why are they so silent when they see</v>

239
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 1>these horrific things happen elsewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world end when I'm left wing,</v>

240
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:09.024
<v Speaker 1>politicians decide they want to bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>those horrific things into our </v>

241
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're Justin Trudeau wants to bring all</v>

242
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:14.190
<v Speaker 1>of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Syrian,</v>

243
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 1>they're not refugees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they're migrants.</v>

244
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 1>You know Angela Merkel in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about moment ago.</v>

245
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.230
<v Speaker 1>opened the borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there 2 million Syrians in Germany?</v>

247
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Nobody really knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know it's at least 1.21</v>

248
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:29.301
<v Speaker 1>point 4 million fundamentally altering </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fabric of Germany and importing with</v>

249
00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:30.330
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing him with it.</v>

250
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Did we have a crash?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we still recording audio?</v>

251
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>

252
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:37.440
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to reboot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're watching this on youtube,</v>

253
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you're not watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not seeing anything.</v>

254
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.780
<v Speaker 1>You're not seeing anything from Ed map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are right now.</v>

255
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause really minded folks.</v>

256
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Cause we said feminism and Islam and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Merkel on together,</v>

257
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.990
<v Speaker 1>they came in European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came in,</v>

258
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.000
<v Speaker 1>they sat in union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sent a bomb through the pipes.</v>

259
00:09:54.001 --> 00:09:56.140
<v Speaker 1>We've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got the stuxnet is in,</v>

260
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.060
<v Speaker 1>is in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

261
00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:57.963
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't think anybody is saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's no racism and no one's </v>

262
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:02.940
<v Speaker 1>saying there's no sex and we agree on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

263
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.740
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

264
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some that there is,</v>

265
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 1>should be combated in some sort of a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll show,</v>

266
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:11.370
<v Speaker 1>but that's takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes care of itself pretty much.</v>

267
00:10:11.371 --> 00:10:12.204
<v Speaker 1>I mean that when was the last time </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody said it's like a genuinely </v>

268
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:18.360
<v Speaker 1>sexist are genuinely racist remark in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend group you were out and say in the</v>

269
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:20.490
<v Speaker 1>bar with and didn't get corrected by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

270
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friends who would all be joking,</v>

271
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.890
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many,</v>

272
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.740
<v Speaker 1>how many white supremacists to do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really think,</v>

273
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.603
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in America compared to black </v>

274
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:33.810
<v Speaker 1>supremacist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many genuinely misogynistic women,</v>

275
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.673
<v Speaker 1>women hating men?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there are in America </v>

276
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 1>compared to the women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the young women that third wave feminism</v>

277
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:41.880
<v Speaker 1>has bread or the third wave feminism </v>
<v Speaker 1>though is organized,</v>

278
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.690
<v Speaker 1>whereas the misogynist men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time they're isolated living</v>

279
00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:46.524
<v Speaker 1>in cabins in the woods and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to speculate because we never </v>

280
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:50.970
<v Speaker 1>meet any because we don't know any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any,</v>

281
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:51.804
<v Speaker 1>I've never met one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've met plenty of man hating </v>

282
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 1>lesbian monsters who would be perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy to see men rounded up in camps.</v>

283
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I've never met her real misogynist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

284
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.060
<v Speaker 1>and I try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try.</v>

285
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:04.320
<v Speaker 1>I try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

286
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.590
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't they be my fans if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed?</v>

287
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

288
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm always being accused of providing </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover for these people,</v>

289
00:11:09.931 --> 00:11:12.180
<v Speaker 1>but I've never found any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

290
00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:13.790
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean they're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

291
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.830
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the people that murder women?</v>

292
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean those are real people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

293
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:23.070
<v Speaker 1>the right rates of in this country been </v>
<v Speaker 1>going down for 30 years.</v>

294
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.040
<v Speaker 1>They have been going down one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

295
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.140
<v Speaker 1>But it's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they still get,</v>

296
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.403
<v Speaker 1>they still happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're never going to get rid of </v>

297
00:11:29.581 --> 00:11:30.414
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

298
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 1>That is something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

299
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.500
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot like language police your way</v>

300
00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:36.020
<v Speaker 1>out of bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's saying Kevin,</v>

301
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.863
<v Speaker 1>which please don't you think culturally </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've evolved past where we were a </v>

302
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.250
<v Speaker 1>thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all agree on that,</v>

303
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:42.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

304
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:44.370
<v Speaker 1>But you don't have to think of how we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to eradicate rape.</v>

305
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.970
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to have her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

306
00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.520
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

307
00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>

308
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:49.590
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

309
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:50.424
<v Speaker 1>one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once we get to the point where we could </v>

310
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:51.654
<v Speaker 1>read each other's minds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have some sort of a embedded chip </v>

311
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.913
<v Speaker 1>that allows us to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you imagine anything worse than </v>

312
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>

313
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Anything less than that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're kind of halfway there.</v>

314
00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.313
<v Speaker 1>Each other's minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how to read my own </v>

315
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:02.320
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>

316
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.410
<v Speaker 1>don't you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know and actually it's,</v>

317
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:06.610
<v Speaker 1>it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318

<v Speaker 1>inside of it.</v>

320
00:12:11.181 --> 00:12:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Like when you say that with your hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>open,</v>

321
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.280
<v Speaker 1>like a jazz dancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're</v>

322
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:16.303
<v Speaker 3>blonde tailored army jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This masculine energy can not be </v>

323
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:23.370
<v Speaker 3>contained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

<v Speaker 3>This masculine.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could coach me through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

329

<v Speaker 3>but you've got sparkly dog tags on.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to go somewhere and you look at</v>

351
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.750
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not suggesting that the men are just</v>

352
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.800
<v Speaker 1>going to rape me when you have to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

353
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.200
<v Speaker 1>What I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying though is it,</v>

354
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:44.883
<v Speaker 2>if you bully men out of the public </v>
<v Speaker 2>square and you sort of demonize and </v>

355
00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:51.900
<v Speaker 2>ridicule and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and almost make it legal,</v>

356
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>

357
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:54.064
<v Speaker 2>normal male behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is happening in schools and </v>

358
00:13:56.231 --> 00:13:57.064
<v Speaker 2>colleges for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also happening in the public </v>

359
00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.254
<v Speaker 2>square.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you make it okay to say almost </v>

360
00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:02.230
<v Speaker 2>anything about men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

361
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of bully man out of the public,</v>

362
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.490
<v Speaker 2>out of public life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bad things happen.</v>

363
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.353
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people have that that has to come </v>

364
00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:13.420
<v Speaker 2>out somewhere and on to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fortunately we do live in a,</v>

365
00:14:13.421 --> 00:14:14.254
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in evolved enough times where most of </v>

366
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:17.500
<v Speaker 2>the time it's just men letting off steam</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Internet and comment sections.</v>

367
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.180
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

368
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:24.070
<v Speaker 2>but you knew that that dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I say dog,</v>

369
00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:26.680
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of dangerous energy that is in</v>

370
00:14:26.681 --> 00:14:28.390
<v Speaker 2>all men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what women like him out,</v>

371
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:28.570
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

372
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.310
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly what meant like about men</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my case.</v>

373
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

374
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:32.344
<v Speaker 2>root of all the best sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason we went to the stars that be </v>

375
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.530
<v Speaker 2>built civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

376
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that makes men awesome.</v>

377
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Does have a flip side to it and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

378
00:14:41.651 --> 00:14:42.970
<v Speaker 2>it can be dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

379
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:46.690
<v Speaker 2>men can be dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also can be managed of course.</v>

380
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.250
<v Speaker 2>But it can't be managed if you lie about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

381
00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:49.084
<v Speaker 2>It can't manage the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you pretend that you can talk your </v>

382
00:14:50.021 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 2>way out of it and it can't be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular.</v>

383
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:52.724
<v Speaker 2>And most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women can't protect themselves from it </v>

384
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.710
<v Speaker 2>if they are lied to about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this sort of,</v>

385
00:14:57.711 --> 00:14:58.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>masculinity.</v>

386
00:14:58.511 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 2>So fragile managers socialized to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent.</v>

387
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 2>They're not just socialized to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

388
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:05.300
<v Speaker 2>this is a hormone thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men just all more aggressive.</v>

389
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.020
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

390
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.960
<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean is for instance in colleges,</v>

391
00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:09.794
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

392
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 2>if you tell women that the worst things </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever going to happen to them,</v>

393
00:15:13.071 --> 00:15:14.870
<v Speaker 2>if somebody's putting a hand on their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their leg,</v>

394
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:15.704
<v Speaker 2>and you call that sexual assault and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>put that in the sexual assault </v>

395
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:20.330
<v Speaker 2>statistics and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tell women,</v>

396
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.193
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can wear whatever you want and you </v>

397
00:15:21.561 --> 00:15:22.394
<v Speaker 2>can go out at 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>AM wearing a miniskirt and no man has a </v>

398
00:15:23.641 --> 00:15:24.730
<v Speaker 2>right to look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

399
00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no victim blaming all the rest of it.</v>

400
00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:30.370
<v Speaker 2>You're telling women in fact that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can put themselves in danger and um,</v>

401
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.270
<v Speaker 2>bad things are going to happen to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

402
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.200
<v Speaker 2>We do live in most of those times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we also have to recognize that there</v>

403
00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:37.034
<v Speaker 2>is something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is something dark and dangerous </v>

404
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:42.830
<v Speaker 2>about men and it is what creates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what it is,</v>

405
00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:47.000
<v Speaker 2>what has driven human civilization to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the heights that it has arisen to.</v>

406
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.520
<v Speaker 2>But it is also why men for most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prisons,</v>

407
00:15:49.521 --> 00:15:50.354
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sublime geniuses and the knuckle </v>

408
00:15:52.341 --> 00:15:55.880
<v Speaker 2>dragging apes of our species are both </v>
<v Speaker 2>male.</v>

409
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

410
00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.540
<v Speaker 2>and you can see that in a variety </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

411
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:01.430
<v Speaker 2>People don't take it very seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can see for instance,</v>

412
00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:04.640
<v Speaker 2>in Iq distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the suggestions that might be the</v>

413
00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:05.540
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

414
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:06.643
<v Speaker 2>sublime musical and artistic geniuses up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the very top end of the Iq scale </v>

415
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 2>where women tend not to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Likewise,</v>

416
00:16:12.411 --> 00:16:13.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down in the knuckle draggers,</v>

417
00:16:13.551 --> 00:16:14.384
<v Speaker 2>70 and 80 Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women tend not to exist down there </v>

418
00:16:15.831 --> 00:16:16.664
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men are more variable than women in </v>

419
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:20.750
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men are more complex I think,</v>

420
00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:24.140
<v Speaker 2>than women in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>

421
00:16:24.141 --> 00:16:24.974
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the idea that you can just sort </v>

422
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:30.350
<v Speaker 2>of buzzfeed your way out of rape and </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization is just insane.</v>

423
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.580
<v Speaker 2>Buzzfeed your way out.</v>

424
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:32.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

425
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.293
<v Speaker 2>if you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you publish enough listicles about </v>

426
00:16:34.821 --> 00:16:36.990
<v Speaker 2>how masculinity is so fragile and white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

427
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.290
<v Speaker 2>straight white men are the root of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil,</v>

428
00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:41.150
<v Speaker 2>that that's somehow going to stop rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

429
00:16:41.151 --> 00:16:41.984
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably </v>

430
00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably going to think,</v>

431
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.920
<v Speaker 2>going to push some men too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

432
00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:49.340
<v Speaker 2>boil over because they're sick of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>lied to and lied about.</v>

433
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.920
<v Speaker 2>But the good news is rape has been going</v>
<v Speaker 2>down for 30 years.</v>

434
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.793
<v Speaker 2>American college campuses are probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>the safest place you could possibly be </v>

435
00:16:55.251 --> 00:16:56.900
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a young woman in America today,</v>

436
00:16:56.901 --> 00:16:58.880
<v Speaker 2>despite what the left tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lies it tells you about.</v>

437
00:16:59.260 --> 00:16:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

438
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about all sorts of things we're in,</v>

439
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.923
<v Speaker 2>we're in a good place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the left won't say that or </v>

440
00:17:04.551 --> 00:17:06.500
<v Speaker 2>acknowledged victory because I'll put </v>
<v Speaker 2>them all out of business.</v>

441
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a strange thing with masculinity</v>

442
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:10.940
<v Speaker 2>where it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

443
00:17:10.941 --> 00:17:14.660
<v Speaker 2>there's ways to manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the best ways to manage it is</v>

444
00:17:14.661 --> 00:17:15.494
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's one of the things that's at </v>

445
00:17:17.061 --> 00:17:18.680
<v Speaker 2>least encouraged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

446
00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:20.420
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with children and with young men.</v>

447
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:22.570
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

448
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:27.080
<v Speaker 2>it's critically important to exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>that demon out of your system,</v>

449
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.153
<v Speaker 2>get that aggression out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's through some form of </v>

450
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:30.584
<v Speaker 2>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's obviously problems with </v>

451
00:17:32.091 --> 00:17:34.370
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the big ones being cte,</v>

452
00:17:34.371 --> 00:17:37.130
<v Speaker 2>that's the same thing with the footage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>CTE.</v>

453
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.770
<v Speaker 2>It's chronic brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chronic traumatic encephalopathy.</v>

454
00:17:40.771 --> 00:17:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I have to be beating each other in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

455
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:43.550
<v Speaker 2>You could just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

456
00:17:43.551 --> 00:17:45.260
<v Speaker 2>you could do athletics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do something,</v>

457
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:45.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

458
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.900
<v Speaker 2>but my point being one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

459
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons that martial arts are</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a good</v>

460
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.933
<v Speaker 1>vehicle is because it calms down one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the main issues with men and aggressive </v>

461
00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:56.610
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is insecurity.</v>

462
00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Insecurity leads to a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive behavior.</v>

463
00:17:59.641 --> 00:18:00.474
<v Speaker 1>When men are more secure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're less likely to engage in </v>

464
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:05.040
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

465
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:07.830
<v Speaker 1>And what is the one product you okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

466
00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:09.750

524
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:05.220
<v Speaker 1>to try to control you to prep two I met </v>

<v Speaker 1>very insecure,</v>

527
00:20:09.661 --> 00:20:10.494
<v Speaker 1>they want to do that and like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one small boy who got attacked by </v>

528
00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:14.784
<v Speaker 1>that girl in school and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatening to cut his hair because he </v>

529
00:20:16.451 --> 00:20:17.810
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he had dreadlocks.</v>

530
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.370
<v Speaker 1>He look really good with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked better than he would've looked</v>

531
00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:21.810
<v Speaker 1>without the dreadlocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

532
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.591
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

535
00:20:23.671 --> 00:20:25.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that is of course,</v>

536
00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:26.244
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreadlocks or not an African American </v>

537
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:28.644
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

538
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.270
<v Speaker 1>but this is precisely why the Greeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Romans,</v>

539
00:20:33.271 --> 00:20:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go on forever.</v>

540
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.230
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm going to say to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is precisely my point.</v>

541
00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:38.064
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural appropriation isn't this sort </v>

542
00:20:38.881 --> 00:20:42.450
<v Speaker 1>of like weird racism that ends in like </v>
<v Speaker 1>1950 or whatever the left thing.</v>

543
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.560
<v Speaker 1>It's how artworks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cultural appropriation from history</v>

544
00:20:46.561 --> 00:20:49.270
<v Speaker 1>include Picasso Volkner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

545
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:49.961
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna,</v>

546
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:51.280
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna are you gonna Start Saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

547
00:20:51.281 --> 00:20:52.840
<v Speaker 1>wagner shouldn't have been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

548
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:55.180
<v Speaker 1>drawing from the norse Eder and from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

549
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:58.000
<v Speaker 1>from the Neba lung and lead and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these sort of norse myths that he use to</v>

550
00:20:58.001 --> 00:20:59.980
<v Speaker 1>craft their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring this knee belonging because that's</v>

551
00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:02.110
<v Speaker 1>cultural appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are insane.</v>

552
00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:05.290
<v Speaker 1>They've never read a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've never read a book.</v>

553
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.900
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand how history and </v>
<v Speaker 1>artwork.</v>

554
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's so frustrating to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressionable young,</v>

555
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:10.624
<v Speaker 1>smart people start to soak this stuff up</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they just never hear the </v>

556
00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:14.074
<v Speaker 1>alternatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what my college tours for </v>

557
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.151
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

558
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.980
<v Speaker 1>it's just shocks me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrifying.</v>

559
00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:19.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just based on such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

560
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 1>his such historical ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a target of recreational outrage?</v>

561
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:24.611
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

562
00:21:24.611 --> 00:21:25.270
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

563
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is recreation.</v>

564
00:21:26.361 --> 00:21:26.630
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

565
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:27.463
<v Speaker 1>but they've found an area like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman who was picking on that boy with </v>

566
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:33.310
<v Speaker 1>the dreadlocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very cool girl and boy,</v>

567
00:21:33.311 --> 00:21:36.250
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very clear that she was a bully and</v>

568
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:37.690
<v Speaker 1>he was a small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny,</v>

569
00:21:37.691 --> 00:21:40.700
<v Speaker 1>feeble little guy and she was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them for the sres.</v>

570
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was.</v>

571
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was.</v>

572
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.013
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know this is this the self </v>

573
00:21:43.961 --> 00:21:44.794
<v Speaker 1>loathing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which so often turns into bullying and </v>

574
00:21:46.091 --> 00:21:48.460
<v Speaker 1>when you hear you do you know about her </v>
<v Speaker 1>background as well,</v>

575
00:21:48.461 --> 00:21:50.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She grew up in foster care.</v>

576
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.020
<v Speaker 1>She had a very horrible child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damaged as all hell.</v>

577
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:53.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

578
00:21:53.411 --> 00:21:55.720
<v Speaker 1>She wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wants the rest of the to suffer like</v>

579
00:21:55.721 --> 00:21:57.670
<v Speaker 1>she thinks she's suffered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she did suffer,</v>

580
00:21:57.671 --> 00:21:58.504
<v Speaker 1>but this is probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she probably did and I'm sorry about </v>

581
00:22:00.401 --> 00:22:00.970
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

582
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.480
<v Speaker 1>to cultural appropriation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like having a go at somebody for wearing</v>

583
00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 1>dreadlocks is not the way to get over </v>
<v Speaker 1>your damage.</v>

584
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.380
<v Speaker 1>The way to get out of your damages </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy and drugs,</v>

585
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just to deal with yourself.</v>

586
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:12.203
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just sad that this is something </v>

587
00:22:13.481 --> 00:22:17.530
<v Speaker 1>that has become a thing and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeating thing when I'm going to cut it</v>

588
00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:20.390
<v Speaker 1>off at the root because it's a nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's garbage.</v>

589
00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:21.743
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely on your own of cutting it </v>

590
00:22:24.001 --> 00:22:24.521
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but oh,</v>

591
00:22:24.521 --> 00:22:25.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to salute you and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>

592
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it just with that Indian</v>

593
00:22:28.031 --> 00:22:29.050
<v Speaker 1>outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

594
00:22:29.051 --> 00:22:29.291
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

595
00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:30.820
<v Speaker 1>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a huge variety,</v>

596
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.620
<v Speaker 1>a variety of outfits planned for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

597
00:22:32.621 --> 00:22:35.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wear everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything the left finds offensive.</v>

598
00:22:35.441 --> 00:22:38.410
<v Speaker 1>What is the most offensive native </v>
<v Speaker 1>American stuff?</v>

599
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.510
<v Speaker 1>It's usually the people that were the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most maligned crest,</v>

600
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I think native cause it's Yale and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very hypersensitive.</v>

601
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Can it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause the smart kids aren't violent.</v>

602
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Like some of them have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The smart kids are just like,</v>

603
00:22:49.781 --> 00:22:51.160
<v Speaker 1>just lose their minds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

604
00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:53.390
<v Speaker 1>and just start like spurting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

605
00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.453
<v Speaker 1>so I think the native American stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoys in the most because they know </v>

606
00:22:57.011 --> 00:22:57.844
<v Speaker 1>it's because they know the cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriation element of it is such </v>

607
00:22:59.981 --> 00:23:01.660
<v Speaker 1>rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they actually cared,</v>

608
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.780
<v Speaker 1>they would quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would quit the college that is like</v>

609
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:07.210
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a burial ground or something,</v>

610
00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:08.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell Yale is built on.</v>

611
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:10.983
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because they know it's so </v>

612
00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.230
<v Speaker 1>absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And insane.</v>

613
00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Of course they're even more upset about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because the stakes are so low.</v>

614
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.193
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think native Americans going to be </v>

615
00:23:21.251 --> 00:23:24.050
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if I can do black face.</v>

616
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I have to ask my editor about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can and you must.</v>

617
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.840
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you,</v>

618
00:23:28.841 --> 00:23:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Dave Chappelle did white face on TV.</v>

619
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:31.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can.</v>

620
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Why not if I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so did Mariah Carey's ex husband,</v>

621
00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.700
<v Speaker 1>did he the pretty one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick,</v>

622
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:37.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nick cannon.</v>

623
00:23:37.981 --> 00:23:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Nick Cannon did take place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

624
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:40.990
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fine,</v>

625
00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:45.070
<v Speaker 1>but I know that it's impossible to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist against white people.</v>

626
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

627
00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:47.613
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the most adorable thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have created to try to justify </v>

628
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.570
<v Speaker 1>black racism against white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it is not possible.</v>

629
00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.320
<v Speaker 1>You know what it is and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's this amazing combination of,</v>

630
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.273
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ignorance and condescension because </v>

631
00:24:04.281 --> 00:24:05.114
<v Speaker 1>they're stupid and they'd never read a </v>
<v Speaker 1>history book and they don't understand </v>

632
00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:09.350
<v Speaker 1>how bigotry or hatred works or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or any,</v>

633
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.100
<v Speaker 1>any kind of historical function or any </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche,</v>

634
00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:12.983
<v Speaker 1>psychological process whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time they're trying to </v>

635
00:24:15.561 --> 00:24:18.230
<v Speaker 1>explain to you how you actually don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what racism means.</v>

636
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:19.700
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism isn't just,</v>

637
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:20.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking another racism as good as </v>

638
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:22.030
<v Speaker 1>yours.</v>

639
00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Racism is actually a complex system of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudice.</v>

640
00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only have to,</v>

641
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.630
<v Speaker 1>it can only be done if you have power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and why people have power.</v>

642
00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Black people don't have any power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

643
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.593
<v Speaker 1>it's not like there's a black president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird because at my college </v>

644
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.573
<v Speaker 1>talkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black people forcing me off stage while </v>

645
00:24:36.531 --> 00:24:39.620
<v Speaker 1>the university administration told </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago peanut pd not to intervene.</v>

646
00:24:39.621 --> 00:24:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you,</v>

647
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.850
<v Speaker 1>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is at Depaul,</v>

648
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:43.003
<v Speaker 1>a Catholic University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has some of the most enthusiastic </v>

649
00:24:45.201 --> 00:24:47.900
<v Speaker 1>abortion advocates on campus anywhere in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

650
00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:48.973
<v Speaker 1>I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if this is true that </v>

651
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.670
<v Speaker 1>this took a port.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

652
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.260
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so one of the most left wing places</v>

653
00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:56.210
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does have to funny expression,</v>

654
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.690
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic abortion advocates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>

655
00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:01.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not joking.</v>

656
00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:01.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

657
00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.430
<v Speaker 1>this isn't just me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go like,</v>

658
00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it Lindy West that guardian nuggets,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

660
00:25:06.351 --> 00:25:09.410

<v Speaker 1>feminist Hashtag it trended.</v>

661
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.020
<v Speaker 1>They're proud of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're proud of murdering babies.</v>

662
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:13.880
<v Speaker 1>They are perfectly happy to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

663
00:25:13.881 --> 00:25:16.120
<v Speaker 1>They think it's a mark of pride like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

664
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't make this stuff up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just laugh along with everybody else.</v>

665
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't invent this.</v>

666
00:25:20.991 --> 00:25:22.400
<v Speaker 1>They love the portions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

667
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:24.470
<v Speaker 1>it's like a badge of honor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like scout badges,</v>

668
00:25:24.471 --> 00:25:26.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how many of you had sister,</v>

669
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm a serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are insane.</v>

670
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a favor of abortion.</v>

671
00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:32.534
<v Speaker 1>As long as you can't tell what it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Monday be your charge to shock me </v>

672
00:25:38.481 --> 00:25:40.360
<v Speaker 1>and am on unshockable as soon as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts looking at,</v>

673
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

674
00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.453
<v Speaker 1>not a person that would ever step in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say you can and can't do anything with </v>

675
00:25:45.741 --> 00:25:48.290
<v Speaker 1>your body as long as the baby's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman's body.</v>

676
00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Technically we differ on that one from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one.</v>

677
00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

678
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think there's a different,</v>

679
00:25:56.181 --> 00:25:57.014
<v Speaker 1>I'm hardline on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you can't tell anybody what they </v>

680
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 1>can and can't do with their body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

681
00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:04.010
<v Speaker 1>it isn't just about the woman's body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once she becomes pregnant,</v>

682
00:26:04.011 --> 00:26:06.240
<v Speaker 1>she's responsible for another body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another soul,</v>

683
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.093
<v Speaker 1>another human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's don't get into the soul thing </v>

684
00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:08.804
<v Speaker 1>cause we had a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very unproductive conversation about </v>

685
00:26:10.941 --> 00:26:11.774
<v Speaker 1>that last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

686
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:12.501
<v Speaker 1>but just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

687
00:26:12.501 --> 00:26:15.920
<v Speaker 1>this is another human being and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman has sole custody if you like.</v>

688
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.170
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you can trust or of cells,</v>

689
00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:22.490
<v Speaker 1>if it's like literally four or five </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells get sucked out,</v>

690
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.400
<v Speaker 1>stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop it.</v>

691
00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:26.811
<v Speaker 1>Stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>

692
00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:29.180
<v Speaker 1>look as a gay person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to be against abortion because as</v>

693
00:26:29.181 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 1>soon as they start working out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay gene,</v>

694
00:26:30.801 --> 00:26:31.634
<v Speaker 1>whatever is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

695
00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.850
<v Speaker 1>instead of going to get chopped because </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants a gay kid.</v>

696
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:35.900
<v Speaker 1>If you've got the choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

697
00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.850
<v Speaker 1>If from Sally cone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stupid in America,</v>

698
00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.070
<v Speaker 1>early colon,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about,</v>

729
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

730
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abortion.</v>

731
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

732
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.380
<v Speaker 1>The Gauging Sal Khan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

733
00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:50.251
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

734
00:27:50.251 --> 00:27:51.090
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

735
00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:52.810
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

736
00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:53.643
<v Speaker 1>she famously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well not famously because she's not </v>

737
00:27:54.661 --> 00:27:55.494
<v Speaker 1>famous because she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just a source of amusement on </v>

738
00:27:57.331 --> 00:27:58.050
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

739
00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:59.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

740
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.140
<v Speaker 1>she's on CNN weirdly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

741
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.560
<v Speaker 1>she said she'd like a gay kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She specifically wants a gay child,</v>

742
00:28:04.561 --> 00:28:07.860
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was just sort of weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just want a healthy kid.</v>

743
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not just want a child or want,</v>

744
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a smart,</v>

745
00:28:11.941 --> 00:28:12.930
<v Speaker 1>athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>

746
00:28:12.931 --> 00:28:13.591
<v Speaker 1>popular kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

747
00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:14.520
<v Speaker 1>she wants a gay one.</v>

748
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because she's a narcissist.</v>

749
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.213
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't care about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen to that child and </v>

750
00:28:18.361 --> 00:28:19.194
<v Speaker 1>it's lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any of the unhappy things that might </v>

751
00:28:20.431 --> 00:28:21.264
<v Speaker 1>happen to that child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not talking about bigotry or </v>

752
00:28:22.081 --> 00:28:23.730
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say we cure homophobia.</v>

753
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:24.683
<v Speaker 1>Great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm having sex with somebody and </v>

754
00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:28.140
<v Speaker 1>cannot create a child with a person I </v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

755
00:28:28.141 --> 00:28:29.400
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the act of intercourse,</v>

756
00:28:29.401 --> 00:28:32.130
<v Speaker 1>like that's kind of kind of rough </v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly.</v>

757
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not great and a lot of people don't</v>

758
00:28:33.991 --> 00:28:35.430
<v Speaker 1>go through their lives thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

759
00:28:35.431 --> 00:28:37.290
<v Speaker 1>But I've have that has occurred to me in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>

760
00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:39.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many reasons why you might not</v>

761
00:28:39.481 --> 00:28:41.220
<v Speaker 1>choose to be gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all else being equal.</v>

762
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.020
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just a sort of narcissistic,</v>

763
00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:44.820
<v Speaker 1>sociopath and Weirdo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most people,</v>

764
00:28:44.821 --> 00:28:45.331
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

765
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:47.340
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we believe the gay lobby,</v>

766
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.250
<v Speaker 1>which lies and says people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gays are born this way,</v>

767
00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:51.930
<v Speaker 1>which of course is rubbish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

768
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:55.190
<v Speaker 1>if we believe them and we find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if scientists come,</v>

769
00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:56.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're right.</v>

770
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:58.380
<v Speaker 1>If they are right and scientists come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this,</v>

771
00:28:58.381 --> 00:28:59.214
<v Speaker 1>this gay gene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well was the first group of people to </v>

772
00:29:00.481 --> 00:29:02.040
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's me anyway.</v>

773
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

774
00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:03.963
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of shit going on in these </v>

775
00:29:04.801 --> 00:29:06.090
<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These sentences,</v>

776
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:07.840
<v Speaker 1>they go one way and another way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

777
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:09.930
<v Speaker 1>That's how my brain works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

778
00:29:09.931 --> 00:29:10.764
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were actually talking about being </v>

779
00:29:12.331 --> 00:29:15.270
<v Speaker 1>born gay is a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that's what it's obvious.</v>

780
00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:16.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously a mixture.</v>

781
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.610
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously a mixture of nature or </v>
<v Speaker 1>nurture.</v>

782
00:29:17.611 --> 00:29:19.200
<v Speaker 1>But the gay lobby lies and says it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

783
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.063
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did this and the ats that the </v>

784
00:29:20.401 --> 00:29:22.350
<v Speaker 1>reason they did it as I'm in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties and nineties,</v>

785
00:29:22.351 --> 00:29:24.390
<v Speaker 1>because the religious right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're saying,</v>

786
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that being gay was a bad moral choice.</v>

787
00:29:27.061 --> 00:29:28.260
<v Speaker 1>It was a bad lifestyle choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

788
00:29:28.261 --> 00:29:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Remember the expression and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

789
00:29:31.201 --> 00:29:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Christian Christians would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate the sin,</v>

790
00:29:33.151 --> 00:29:34.350
<v Speaker 1>love the sinner and all the rest of it.</v>

791
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.510
<v Speaker 1>And there was this problem because gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>people or gay,</v>

792
00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.030
<v Speaker 1>the gay lobby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by their logic there,</v>

793
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:40.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we do with this?</v>

794
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:41.163
<v Speaker 1>Aha?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if we're like blacks or what if we </v>

795
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.070
<v Speaker 1>like women?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if this is just what we are?</v>

796
00:29:45.071 --> 00:29:45.904
<v Speaker 1>Because that makes them bigots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they invented this born this way </v>

797
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:49.480
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is that nobody knows.</v>

798
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.373
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you ever see the study that was </v>

799
00:29:50.921 --> 00:29:51.754
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe is out of the University of </v>

800
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:53.973
<v Speaker 1>Rome with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found a direct correlation between </v>

801
00:29:55.931 --> 00:29:58.600
<v Speaker 1>very promiscuous mothers and gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

802
00:29:59.020 --> 00:29:59.411
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

803
00:29:59.411 --> 00:30:00.244
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some people who think that </v>

804
00:30:00.971 --> 00:30:03.090
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

805
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:06.640
<v Speaker 1>might have dual effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There could be genetic or even epogen or</v>

806
00:30:06.641 --> 00:30:07.474
<v Speaker 1>epigenetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you buy into that stuff can be </v>

807
00:30:08.501 --> 00:30:11.450
<v Speaker 1>epigenetic factors in the room and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormonal stuff that,</v>

808
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.353
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes about as a result of a woman </v>

809
00:30:13.931 --> 00:30:15.940
<v Speaker 1>having a high sex drive that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>result in a gate kid,</v>

810
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.530
<v Speaker 1>but also when the kid is born.</v>

811
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:21.430
<v Speaker 1>If the mom's still a whore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe I'm just saying,</v>

812
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:22.030
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

813
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:22.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

814
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.620
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Mommy's putting,</v>

815
00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:24.454
<v Speaker 1>if Mommy's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

816
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.450
<v Speaker 1>spreading her legs all over town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

817
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.180
<v Speaker 1>could that affect a child's sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>development?</v>

818
00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

819
00:30:29.711 --> 00:30:31.450
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do remember that one though.</v>

820
00:30:31.451 --> 00:30:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I didn't read it closely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do remember that one.</v>

821
00:30:32.951 --> 00:30:36.280
<v Speaker 1>And I think that what I came away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that with was if you have,</v>

822
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a hoe for a mom,</v>

823
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.390
<v Speaker 1>there's probably multiple reasons you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might end up gay,</v>

824
00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:41.503
<v Speaker 1>but they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't go that far with it because </v>

825
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:47.070
<v Speaker 1>when you start accusing that mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

826
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.850
<v Speaker 1>you're making these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

827
00:30:48.851 --> 00:30:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I think you're probably on point with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

828
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:51.783
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not something a university </v>

829
00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:53.584
<v Speaker 1>would ever say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No because they're idiots because they </v>

830
00:30:54.731 --> 00:30:56.570
<v Speaker 1>don't actually want to get to the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to virtue signal.</v>

831
00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a little bit of that,</v>

832
00:30:58.211 --> 00:31:00.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also one of those things where it's</v>

833
00:31:00.251 --> 00:31:02.470
<v Speaker 1>just really problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you can't,</v>

834
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:04.310
<v Speaker 1>you can say that and ironically then </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

835
00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.163
<v Speaker 1>you can't prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say tell the truth about their </v>

836
00:31:07.301 --> 00:31:08.134
<v Speaker 1>sex lives is like expecting fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People tell the truth about the </v>

837
00:31:09.731 --> 00:31:11.470
<v Speaker 1>calorific intake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't happen.</v>

838
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:12.443
<v Speaker 1>Well they believe that somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another it was some sort of a variation </v>

839
00:31:16.331 --> 00:31:19.460
<v Speaker 1>on the x chromosome that made these </v>
<v Speaker 1>women right,</v>

840
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.030
<v Speaker 1>not just psychologically attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

841
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.073
<v Speaker 1>but that there was obviously there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a physical attraction that </v>

842
00:31:25.211 --> 00:31:26.044
<v Speaker 1>heterosexual women have towards men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that should vary and it will vary on a </v>

843
00:31:28.901 --> 00:31:32.110
<v Speaker 1>wide scale and the extreme end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>

844
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:32.944
<v Speaker 1>They believe this just these women that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are just almost like you roll a dick in </v>

845
00:31:36.011 --> 00:31:37.780
<v Speaker 1>front of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like a kitten on a ball of yarn.</v>

846
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:38.643
<v Speaker 1>They just can't help know how they feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that these women will pass this </v>

847
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:45.850
<v Speaker 1>trait on even to their male children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

848
00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See my mother's quite frigid.</v>

849
00:31:47.861 --> 00:31:48.980
<v Speaker 1>So it just goes to show the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

850
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:52.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the etiology of homosexuality is,</v>

851
00:31:52.151 --> 00:31:52.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple is,</v>

852
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:54.580
<v Speaker 1>is varied and complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

853
00:31:54.581 --> 00:31:59.020
<v Speaker 1>that might be the only point I'm making </v>
<v Speaker 1>is simply every credible sciences,</v>

854
00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.140
<v Speaker 1>every reasonable person knows that it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost certainly a mixture of nature and</v>

855
00:32:02.141 --> 00:32:04.720
<v Speaker 1>nurture and that that mix can change </v>
<v Speaker 1>from person to person.</v>

856
00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these things can get mixed up and</v>

857
00:32:07.841 --> 00:32:10.510
<v Speaker 1>ended up with somebody choosing to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy or not fucking guy.</v>

858
00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:11.373
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

859
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.940
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gay lobby,</v>

860
00:32:12.941 --> 00:32:15.070
<v Speaker 1>because they were scared at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

861
00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.350
<v Speaker 1>and because they wanted an easy answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came up with this,</v>

862
00:32:17.351 --> 00:32:18.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

863
00:32:18.041 --> 00:32:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Now it's embedded in culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lady Gaga born this way and it's a lie.</v>

864
00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lie saying that,</v>

865
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.440
<v Speaker 1>saying that if something is like not </v>
<v Speaker 1>black and white and it's like probably,</v>

866
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:31.830
<v Speaker 1>actually it probably about 50 50 saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely black is a lie.</v>

867
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:33.063
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the gape gay lobby lies to gay </v>

868
00:32:34.931 --> 00:32:37.030
<v Speaker 1>people and that's partially born this </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

869
00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't make a good song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partially partially born this way.</v>

870
00:32:40.791 --> 00:32:41.624
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like something you'd see on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>planned parenthood for me as like </v>

871
00:32:45.081 --> 00:32:47.480
<v Speaker 1>something that David Daleiden has </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed in his,</v>

872
00:32:47.481 --> 00:32:49.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his undercover videos.</v>

873
00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I on returning to the abortion thing,</v>

874
00:32:52.551 --> 00:32:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what don't you think that it's like many</v>

875
00:32:57.081 --> 00:32:59.360
<v Speaker 1>things like even homosexuality we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

876
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.253
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot going on there to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're talking about a very </v>

877
00:33:03.861 --> 00:33:06.680
<v Speaker 1>small cluster of cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me it starts at conception.</v>

878
00:33:06.681 --> 00:33:07.514
<v Speaker 1>I think from that moment on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're locked into this nine month </v>

879
00:33:10.911 --> 00:33:12.530
<v Speaker 1>journey with the human inside your body.</v>

880
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

881
00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want a merger,</v>

882
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:15.194
<v Speaker 1>it then go ahead and murder it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But be honest about what you're doing </v>

883
00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:20.120
<v Speaker 1>and don't call it women's bodily choices</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that is sociopathy and that it's</v>

884
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.860
<v Speaker 1>two cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's murder,</v>

885
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:23.143
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm thinking going to have to </v>

886
00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:25.190
<v Speaker 1>say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

887
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:27.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a hard liner,</v>

888
00:33:27.201 --> 00:33:29.540
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hotline on very many things.</v>

889
00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Aside from the friend that feminist to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly and stupid and eastern mysticism,</v>

890
00:33:33.951 --> 00:33:38.060
<v Speaker 1>what is it that 48 days where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe the soul enters the body.</v>

891
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:42.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the formation of the pineal gland</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the seat of the soul.</v>

892
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it like 48 days?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we just know about it?</v>

893
00:33:45.901 --> 00:33:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm a 48 day cutoffs and mysticism was </v>
<v Speaker 1>not an area that I've,</v>

894
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one had researched.</v>

895
00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.220
<v Speaker 1>It was a new house to no one in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's still a house.</v>

896
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:57.380
<v Speaker 1>It's still a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

897
00:33:57.381 --> 00:33:59.570
<v Speaker 1>But if it gets wrecked and no one has </v>
<v Speaker 1>any memories,</v>

898
00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.600
<v Speaker 1>it's no big deal if you say so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

899
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just playing devil that devil's out.</v>

900
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Get you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

901
00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.030
<v Speaker 1>do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

902
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.680
<v Speaker 1>I think you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>

903
00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:13.340
<v Speaker 1>do you believe in the Myers brigg stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the e n t j stuff?</v>

904
00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.080
<v Speaker 1>There's explained that to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

905
00:34:15.081 --> 00:34:16.520
<v Speaker 1>so there's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

906
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:20.720
<v Speaker 1>it's this system of personality types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And apparently if you,</v>

907
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.660
<v Speaker 1>if you can do sort of a 50 question test</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>

908
00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:24.503
<v Speaker 1>it come up with a single intg NFP and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be at to predict what </v>

909
00:34:27.381 --> 00:34:31.700
<v Speaker 1>kind of job you would be good at and </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict your sort of characteristics and</v>

910
00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:33.860
<v Speaker 1>behaviors and who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who else in the world you'll get on with</v>

911
00:34:33.861 --> 00:34:34.694
<v Speaker 1>and how you'll succeed in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've got like the lawyers won the </v>

912
00:34:36.891 --> 00:34:37.700
<v Speaker 1>devil's advocate one.</v>

913
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.533
<v Speaker 1>I think you have it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a sort of voracious appetite </v>

914
00:34:40.701 --> 00:34:42.610
<v Speaker 1>for information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love to read and find out.</v>

915
00:34:42.611 --> 00:34:43.444
<v Speaker 1>But everything love to talk to smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>people love to be provocative and </v>

916
00:34:45.921 --> 00:34:46.754
<v Speaker 1>interesting and sometimes adopt </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions you don't necessarily hold </v>

917
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.753
<v Speaker 1>because the debate is fascinating and </v>
<v Speaker 1>love just the cut and thrust of </v>

918
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:56.270
<v Speaker 1>intellectual argument discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

919
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have that too.</v>

920
00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:58.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

921
00:34:58.281 --> 00:35:00.050
<v Speaker 1>that's well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you believe in such things.</v>

922
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

923
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:01.783
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

924
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.830
<v Speaker 1>But I think also I'm a different person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

925
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.280
<v Speaker 1>every six or seven months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

926
00:35:07.281 --> 00:35:08.114
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm constantly evolving and </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing and reevaluating or at least </v>

927
00:35:11.391 --> 00:35:12.224
<v Speaker 1>attempting to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm definitely a different person </v>

928
00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:14.594
<v Speaker 1>than I was 10 or 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you take that into consideration </v>

929
00:35:17.811 --> 00:35:20.420
<v Speaker 1>that that's my problem with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these tests,</v>

930
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:23.510
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing is they're sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>testing who you are right now.</v>

931
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:28.850
<v Speaker 1>And one of the problems with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitions is the self defining aspects</v>

932
00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:30.110
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you start saying,</v>

933
00:35:30.111 --> 00:35:32.570
<v Speaker 1>well this is me and this is who I am </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of just,</v>

934
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.610
<v Speaker 1>and then it becomes so fulfilling </v>
<v Speaker 1>prophecy.</v>

935
00:35:34.611 --> 00:35:35.444
<v Speaker 1>You think you're locked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another one of the things I like </v>

936
00:35:37.801 --> 00:35:38.820
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should stop complimenting you.</v>

937
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:39.923
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's another one of the things I like </v>

938
00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:41.970
<v Speaker 1>about is you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great,</v>

939
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:42.893
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have well developed sense of </v>

940
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:44.603
<v Speaker 1>intellectual humility and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're always sort of open and </v>

941
00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:47.574
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I liked that because I think you </v>

942
00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:50.980
<v Speaker 1>have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no way I like,</v>

943
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.833
<v Speaker 1>I like that in this day and age we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>so many subjects that you can extract </v>

944
00:35:57.871 --> 00:35:58.704
<v Speaker 1>information from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is impossible to know everything </v>

945
00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:00.924
<v Speaker 1>about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all the subjects that we're </v>

946
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:04.140
<v Speaker 1>discussing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all change.</v>

947
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.120
<v Speaker 1>There's new data comes in constantly.</v>

948
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.730
<v Speaker 1>And to pretend that you know everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>about everything is just you couldn't,</v>

949
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:10.390
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do that in 1992.</v>

950
00:36:10.391 --> 00:36:13.380
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny what they say about facts and</v>

951
00:36:13.381 --> 00:36:15.270
<v Speaker 1>science have a half life of seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

952
00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:18.840
<v Speaker 1>everything that you think you know in </v>
<v Speaker 1>science becomes wrong in under a decade,</v>

953
00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.580
<v Speaker 1>in every field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in nutrition,</v>

954
00:36:20.581 --> 00:36:22.470
<v Speaker 1>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just constantly changing.</v>

955
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:23.963
<v Speaker 1>I find that fascinating instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical uncertainty about everything </v>

956
00:36:26.071 --> 00:36:27.870
<v Speaker 1>around it's varied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think this is,</v>

957
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.180
<v Speaker 1>this is why people would like to grasp </v>
<v Speaker 1>the certainty.</v>

958
00:36:30.181 --> 00:36:33.150
<v Speaker 1>And it is why I'm going to hand you an </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument here because this is it.</v>

959
00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Cause I know you don't like religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>very much.</v>

960
00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:35.364
<v Speaker 1>This is why people like faith so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it gives them an anchor in a </v>

961
00:36:37.951 --> 00:36:42.180
<v Speaker 1>very uncertain disinter mediated sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>very uncertain,</v>

962
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:43.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

963
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:44.003
<v Speaker 1>globalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing world wherever you want to </v>

964
00:36:45.721 --> 00:36:47.910
<v Speaker 1>sort of uprooted and thrown in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Maelstrom were nothing.</v>

965
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:48.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing seems,</v>

966
00:36:48.961 --> 00:36:49.794
<v Speaker 1>seems constant or true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Local communities has been broken down </v>

967
00:36:51.781 --> 00:36:52.290
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

968
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.780
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big states that take the role of parents</v>

969
00:36:54.781 --> 00:36:55.561
<v Speaker 1>and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

970
00:36:55.561 --> 00:36:56.110
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

971
00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

972
00:36:57.091 --> 00:36:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I think people clear to that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also,</v>

973
00:36:58.621 --> 00:37:02.070
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleave to less helpful systems of belief</v>

974
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.770
<v Speaker 1>like feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

975
00:37:04.771 --> 00:37:06.600
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can equate those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

976
00:37:06.601 --> 00:37:09.240
<v Speaker 1>And I think that a lot of what faith </v>
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

977
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.103
<v Speaker 1>even if it's not based on a real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a scaffolding for four for </v>

978
00:37:15.481 --> 00:37:19.920
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a scaffolding for a reasonable view</v>

979
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:20.783
<v Speaker 1>of the world you live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having some moral guidelines that you </v>

980
00:37:25.111 --> 00:37:25.944
<v Speaker 1>can follow that allow you to live a life</v>
<v Speaker 1>with more positive moments or negative </v>

981
00:37:29.341 --> 00:37:32.100
<v Speaker 1>moments because you're sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravitating towards those in a Christian</v>

982
00:37:32.101 --> 00:37:32.934
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

983
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.020
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

984
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:35.263
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get involved in conversations </v>

985
00:37:36.751 --> 00:37:37.584
<v Speaker 1>trying to sort of persuade them of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence of God because it's comes so </v>

986
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:39.840
<v Speaker 1>completely pointless.</v>

987
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:44.160
<v Speaker 1>But let's just say that these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a variety of belief systems from</v>

988
00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:44.994
<v Speaker 1>which you can choose or which ones are </v>
<v Speaker 1>better because there are some that are </v>

989
00:37:47.281 --> 00:37:49.280
<v Speaker 1>good and some that are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

990
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:50.123
<v Speaker 1>and I would say feminism and the race </v>
<v Speaker 1>baiting of black lives matter and Islam </v>

991
00:37:52.981 --> 00:37:54.030
<v Speaker 1>are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

992
00:37:54.031 --> 00:37:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Christianity on the whole is good or at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least has had pretty good effects.</v>

993
00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good influences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also had some horrible facts,</v>

994
00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.040
<v Speaker 1>especially in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We weren't going to do this,</v>

995
00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:04.440
<v Speaker 1>we weren't going to do this session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

996
00:38:04.441 --> 00:38:05.274
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Islam hasn't gone through the </v>

997
00:38:06.511 --> 00:38:07.500
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

998
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:08.560
<v Speaker 1>I just think it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesse,</v>

999
00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:12.120
<v Speaker 1>did you guys getting one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think it's impossible.</v>

1000
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.383
<v Speaker 1>It's a possible change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's highly unlikely that Islam </v>

1001
00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:18.003
<v Speaker 1>will ever get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's ever going to engage </v>

1002
00:38:19.891 --> 00:38:22.590
<v Speaker 1>properly with the modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it just needs to be eradicated.</v>

1003
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:26.490
<v Speaker 1>And I've come to this conclusion after </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orlando.</v>

1005
00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I've seen what I've stopped being polite</v>
<v Speaker 1>about as low as was stopped being polite</v>

1006
00:38:30.571 --> 00:38:35.270
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think gay guy as well.</v>

1007
00:38:35.271 --> 00:38:36.740
<v Speaker 1>I he wasn't he gay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what's,</v>

1008
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.640
<v Speaker 1>is that just a rumor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self healthy hating gay Christians.</v>

1009
00:38:39.641 --> 00:38:41.770
<v Speaker 1>They don't shoot up nightclubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they could,</v>

1010
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1011
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.400
<v Speaker 1>the guy who shot up those people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie theater in Aurora,</v>

1012
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy wasn't Islamic.</v>

1013
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.120
<v Speaker 1>He was just some nutty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1014
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.960
<v Speaker 1>This guy just happened to be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self-Loathing,</v>

1015
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:53.200
<v Speaker 1>had guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1016
00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:57.040
<v Speaker 1>we're reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're reading into a nutcase and various</v>

1017
00:38:57.041 --> 00:38:58.040
<v Speaker 1>different things and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1018
00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:58.903
<v Speaker 1>and as you correctly say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think have pinned on your twitter </v>

1019
00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:02.560
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a mental health problem.</v>

1020
00:39:02.561 --> 00:39:04.330
<v Speaker 1>This company off a gun problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1021
00:39:04.331 --> 00:39:06.990
<v Speaker 1>which I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is disguise observation.</v>

1022
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:08.163
<v Speaker 1>This particular guy clearly drew on </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that he was being taught by his </v>

1023
00:39:11.621 --> 00:39:13.410
<v Speaker 1>faith and let's be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know,</v>

1024
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.343
<v Speaker 1>declared that he was doing it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>name of his faith and in the name of </v>

1025
00:39:17.141 --> 00:39:17.974
<v Speaker 1>Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1026
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.620
<v Speaker 1>At some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to take the guy at his word.</v>

1027
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Dave Chappelle has a great joke about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1028
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give away as bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but essentially it's like,</v>

1029
00:39:27.191 --> 00:39:28.860
<v Speaker 1>it's quite a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do it.</v>

1030
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.100
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1031
00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:32.740
<v Speaker 1>you can't claim something right before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it.</v>

1032
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Like right about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat a girl's pussy,</v>

1033
00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.710
<v Speaker 1>go woo Tang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1034
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:37.503
<v Speaker 1>he can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't claim here in the Wu Tang clan </v>

1035
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.550
<v Speaker 1>just by saying it right before you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1036
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fairly obvious from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

1037
00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.460
<v Speaker 1>this guy's history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was on the FBI watch list.</v>

1038
00:39:47.461 --> 00:39:48.340
<v Speaker 1>A bit started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1039
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.413
<v Speaker 1>it is fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's fun.</v>

1040
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:50.643
<v Speaker 1>At some point you've just got to accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>when people say they're doing it in the </v>

1041
00:39:52.811 --> 00:39:53.920
<v Speaker 1>name of a law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1042
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get it like good.</v>

1043
00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:00.760
<v Speaker 1>But you know like him saying that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it for isis,</v>

1044
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:02.260
<v Speaker 1>that he pledged allegiance to isis.</v>

1045

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:47.743
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think that that's a </v>

1161
00:44:48.481 --> 00:44:50.720
<v Speaker 1>temporary drop and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just have to deal with,</v>

1162
00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:51.451
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1163
00:44:51.451 --> 00:44:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1164
00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:52.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1165
00:44:52.651 --> 00:44:53.580
<v Speaker 1>it's going to rebound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebound.</v>

1166
00:44:53.581 --> 00:44:54.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1167
00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:56.060
<v Speaker 1>if you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you actually don't listen to it,</v>

1168
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:56.933
<v Speaker 1>if you don't read like what Bloomberg </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Msnbc or tweeting and you zoom out </v>

1169
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:01.373
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

1170
00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:02.510
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

1171
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:04.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pound and zoom out on the footsie.</v>

1172
00:45:04.801 --> 00:45:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look so bad at all.</v>

1173
00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:07.411
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1174
00:45:07.411 --> 00:45:07.960
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1175
00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:08.793
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of scam or it's weird to me </v>

1176
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:11.124
<v Speaker 1>that everybody was always so concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a one world government that was a </v>

1177
00:45:13.621 --> 00:45:14.454
<v Speaker 1>big fear.</v>

1178
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.780
<v Speaker 1>There was a big fear of a new world </v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

1179
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.500
<v Speaker 1>one world government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the big conspiracy fears.</v>

1180
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:24.090
<v Speaker 1>But then when England decides to be its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own country and exit the European Union,</v>

1181
00:45:24.091 --> 00:45:24.924
<v Speaker 1>everybody's terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sky is falling with the different </v>

1182
00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:27.090
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different groups.</v>

1183
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.373
<v Speaker 1>So you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are some very smart people </v>

1184
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I speak to who think that globalization </v>
<v Speaker 1>is basically over and that this push to,</v>

1185
00:45:34.891 --> 00:45:35.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1186
00:45:35.461 --> 00:45:36.294
<v Speaker 1>to have this push for open borders </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world hasn't worked and </v>

1187
00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:41.400
<v Speaker 1>people don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

1188
00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:42.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look,</v>

1189
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.160
<v Speaker 1>if you read the work of like Jonathan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Heit or whatever,</v>

1190
00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.370
<v Speaker 1>you will discover that this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism thing,</v>

1191
00:45:47.371 --> 00:45:48.204
<v Speaker 1>it's the level of evolutionary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like being with their own tribe </v>

1192
00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:51.550
<v Speaker 1>and that's not a racism thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just that,</v>

1193
00:45:51.551 --> 00:45:52.384
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is an evolutionary advantage </v>

1194
00:45:54.421 --> 00:45:57.990
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have to get over all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the cultural barriers and just get on</v>

1195
00:45:57.991 --> 00:45:58.824
<v Speaker 1>with doing shit.</v>

1196
00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1197
00:46:00.661 --> 00:46:03.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing all across the world,</v>

1198
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:04.643
<v Speaker 1>not just in Europe as a result of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>globalist policies of Angela Merkel and </v>

1199
00:46:08.141 --> 00:46:09.150
<v Speaker 1>all the rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1200
00:46:09.151 --> 00:46:09.984
<v Speaker 1>in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brexit in Europe and the rise of trump </v>

1201
00:46:11.641 --> 00:46:14.520
<v Speaker 1>and America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people returning to nationalism.</v>

1202
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:16.290
<v Speaker 1>By which we don't mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1203
00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.340
<v Speaker 1>racism by which we mean simply pride in </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation culture and lesser in the West is</v>

1204
00:46:20.341 --> 00:46:20.971
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1205
00:46:20.971 --> 00:46:21.980
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1206
00:46:21.981 --> 00:46:23.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe and America,</v>

1207
00:46:23.461 --> 00:46:25.650
<v Speaker 1>the best bit of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people who,</v>

1208
00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get wrap their heads around that </v>

1209
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:32.180
<v Speaker 1>don't understand why people might wish </v>
<v Speaker 1>to preserve the,</v>

1210
00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:36.120
<v Speaker 1>the cultures that created Mozart and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare and Wagner,</v>

1211
00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:37.373
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also don't understand the economic </v>

1212
00:46:39.181 --> 00:46:40.014
<v Speaker 1>pressures on those people who had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>global one world government conspiracy </v>

1213
00:46:42.661 --> 00:46:43.111
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1214
00:46:43.111 --> 00:46:43.944
<v Speaker 1>they tended to be lower income people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are worried about centralization of </v>

1215
00:46:47.941 --> 00:46:48.720
<v Speaker 1>power away from them.</v>

1216
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.860
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1217
00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:51.120
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was these,</v>

1218
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.313
<v Speaker 1>these liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American liberals who crowing about the </v>

1219
00:46:53.281 --> 00:46:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Browning of America or this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1220
00:46:54.551 --> 00:46:55.980
<v Speaker 1>or they're worried about their culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their families,</v>

1221
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.560
<v Speaker 1>depressed wages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economics as well,</v>

1222
00:46:57.561 --> 00:46:58.394
<v Speaker 1>all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who are worried on the other </v>

1223
00:46:59.431 --> 00:47:00.264
<v Speaker 1>hand about this now are the elites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking about two different </v>

1224
00:47:02.671 --> 00:47:03.990
<v Speaker 1>groups and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the main,</v>

1225
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.120
<v Speaker 1>this is the main route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is really the main fight.</v>

1226
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Now this election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1227
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:09.143
<v Speaker 1>in America and most of the big elections</v>
<v Speaker 1>and referendums over the next 10 years </v>

1228
00:47:11.821 --> 00:47:12.654
<v Speaker 1>are going to be about two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them driven by economics and one </v>

1229
00:47:15.211 --> 00:47:18.150
<v Speaker 1>of them driven by culture and politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economics,</v>

1230
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:19.380
<v Speaker 1>the economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>

1231
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:21.960
<v Speaker 1>is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elites versus the proles.</v>

1232
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:22.973
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the moneyed international few </v>

1233
00:47:24.901 --> 00:47:28.350
<v Speaker 1>versus the rest of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Proles being proletariat for people.</v>

1234
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1235
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of the</v>

1236
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:30.963
<v Speaker 2>rest of us who are worried about wages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worried about immigration and worried </v>

1237
00:47:33.431 --> 00:47:34.680
<v Speaker 2>about culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the,</v>

1238
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.420
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1239
00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.253
<v Speaker 2>the fate of our country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other one of course is men view </v>

1240
00:47:38.681 --> 00:47:39.514
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is entirely manufactured by the </v>

1241
00:47:41.051 --> 00:47:41.740
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1242
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:42.573
<v Speaker 2>and I think the more I see the American </v>
<v Speaker 2>election entirely through the prism of </v>

1243
00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:45.754
<v Speaker 2>men versus women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think trump at trump versus hillary </v>

1244
00:47:47.261 --> 00:47:48.340
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1245
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.941
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

1246
00:47:48.941 --> 00:47:51.010
<v Speaker 2>is a clash of the titans between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1247
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:52.750
<v Speaker 2>the strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blustery,</v>

1248
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:54.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outward looking,</v>

1249
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:55.533
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strong male archetype versus the status </v>

1250
00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:00.920
<v Speaker 2>establishment feminism of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1251
00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:02.680
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Clinton and the Democrats,</v>

1252
00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:03.843
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this election really is men view women </v>

1253
00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.060
<v Speaker 2>and it's not nice to put it in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the left did it not,</v>

1254
00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:07.903
<v Speaker 2>have you seen the compilation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that she has said that she did </v>

1255
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:15.940
<v Speaker 2>versus the things that the FBI has said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that she did?</v>

1256
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that woman,</v>

1257
00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:21.160
<v Speaker 2>I have to be careful that I miss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a day job aside from having,</v>

1258
00:48:21.161 --> 00:48:21.994
<v Speaker 2>doing fun things like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do have a day job as an editor at a </v>

1259
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:25.063
<v Speaker 2>Breitbart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I have to be very careful what names </v>

1260
00:48:26.561 --> 00:48:27.970
<v Speaker 2>I call people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1261
00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:33.060
<v Speaker 2>But markable Rooney Mara lies are out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and can say it very clear,</v>

1262
00:48:35.261 --> 00:48:37.210
<v Speaker 2>remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very obvious.</v>

1263
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.890
<v Speaker 2>She did not tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

1264
00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:42.040
<v Speaker 2>she lied about how many device,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to,</v>

1265
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:45.850
<v Speaker 2>there's a instagram page that has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>compilation of it,</v>

1266
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called liberal tears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes back and forth.</v>

1267
00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:50.373
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shows what the FBI said she did and </v>

1268
00:48:52.571 --> 00:48:56.260
<v Speaker 2>what she said she did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said she only used one device.</v>

1269
00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:57.123
<v Speaker 2>She never sent anything that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>classified and they said she's multiple </v>

1270
00:48:59.741 --> 00:49:00.574
<v Speaker 2>devices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent many classified things and they're </v>

1271
00:49:02.351 --> 00:49:03.184
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the difference between with </v>

1272
00:49:03.791 --> 00:49:08.200
<v Speaker 2>the SPD FBI statement was what she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then she's clearly being deceptive.</v>

1273
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:10.090
<v Speaker 2>But the Department of Justice is on her </v>
<v Speaker 2>side though.</v>

1274
00:49:10.091 --> 00:49:10.601
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1275
00:49:10.601 --> 00:49:11.191
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1276
00:49:11.191 --> 00:49:12.170
<v Speaker 2>they said the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1277
00:49:12.171 --> 00:49:15.170
<v Speaker 2>it was it Camy Komi Cami,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I caught Mary's name to get,</v>

1278
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:17.380
<v Speaker 2>the guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy says we've never prosecuted.</v>

1279
00:49:17.381 --> 00:49:18.214
<v Speaker 2>He said he's in his yesterday for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've never prosecuted somebody for </v>

1280
00:49:20.351 --> 00:49:21.184
<v Speaker 2>doing what Hillary did in a way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to sort of explain away why they </v>

1281
00:49:23.081 --> 00:49:24.370
<v Speaker 2>weren't pressing charges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

1282
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.160
<v Speaker 2>they've issued press releases about </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the past.</v>

1283
00:49:27.161 --> 00:49:31.870
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted it yesterday about Petraeus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>General Petraeus is the whole reason why</v>

1284
00:49:31.871 --> 00:49:32.980
<v Speaker 2>he was removed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

1285
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.700
<v Speaker 2>they have issued press releases crowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about finding these guys in the past.</v>

1286
00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:37.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1287
00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:38.523
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this just shows you how dumb Fox </v>

1288
00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.790
<v Speaker 2>News can be sometimes thinking that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to be an indictment here.</v>

1289
00:49:42.791 --> 00:49:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knew Democrats don't indict </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats,</v>

1290
00:49:45.041 --> 00:49:45.874
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1291
00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.513
<v Speaker 2>an presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary was never going to be indicted </v>

1292
00:49:49.391 --> 00:49:50.320
<v Speaker 2>with Obama in the White House.</v>

1293
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.210
<v Speaker 2>It was not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

1294
00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.610
<v Speaker 2>if she does get indicted and she gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>removed from the race,</v>

1295
00:49:54.611 --> 00:49:56.650
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is there on the democratic </v>
<v Speaker 2>side?</v>

1296
00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Joe Biden want Bernie back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get buried,</v>

1297
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.080
<v Speaker 2>keep burning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1298
00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:01.923
<v Speaker 2>I like him and I like to do to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie supporters fall into two camps </v>

1299
00:50:05.261 --> 00:50:06.094
<v Speaker 2>there like the crazy gender activists </v>
<v Speaker 2>and race baiters but I think that's </v>

1300
00:50:08.591 --> 00:50:09.424
<v Speaker 2>probably only 20% of Bernie people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the Bernie fans aren't that </v>

1301
00:50:12.491 --> 00:50:14.410
<v Speaker 2>dissimilar from trump fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1302
00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:15.860
<v Speaker 2>there are people who don't like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>tablet.</v>

1303
00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:16.993
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of being lied to or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are fed up of the consequences of </v>

1304
00:50:19.721 --> 00:50:20.980
<v Speaker 2>globalization on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1305
00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:22.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>native populations if you like,</v>

1306
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:23.613
<v Speaker 2>worried about all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they express themselves very </v>

1307
00:50:25.751 --> 00:50:26.890
<v Speaker 2>differently from the trump fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1308
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.840
<v Speaker 2>don't use the same language and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even the,</v>

1309
00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:30.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean the polls are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it,</v>

1310
00:50:30.981 --> 00:50:33.290
<v Speaker 2>20 30% of Bernie supporters might come </v>
<v Speaker 2>over to trump and the election.</v>

1311
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.770
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't surprise me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1312
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:35.623
<v Speaker 2>Cause they're very similar people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked Bernie supporters and I like </v>

1313
00:50:38.121 --> 00:50:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's all right.</v>

1314
00:50:39.861 --> 00:50:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Hillary is the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well she is the establishment.</v>

1315
00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:44.053
<v Speaker 2>I mean she is as established a </v>
<v Speaker 2>politician as he could possibly get and </v>

1316
00:50:47.171 --> 00:50:48.170
<v Speaker 2>she has deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

1317
00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:49.440
<v Speaker 2>deep in the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1318
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.590
<v Speaker 2>And there's just a lot of darkness to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1319
00:50:51.591 --> 00:50:52.424
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of danger to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does a lot of danger to embracing that </v>

1320
00:50:54.321 --> 00:50:55.154
<v Speaker 2>just simply because she has a vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife is going to vote for just cause </v>

1321
00:50:58.371 --> 00:50:59.900
<v Speaker 2>she has a vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your wife need no,</v>

1322
00:50:59.901 --> 00:51:01.130
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1323
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:02.990
<v Speaker 2>I do all those things to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't help.</v>

1324
00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't you looking forward to this?</v>

1325
00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Here's the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the,</v>

1326
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.430
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the video.</v>

1327
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:11.960
<v Speaker 2>Listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen to this,</v>

1328
00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:16.220
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>classified material to anyone.</v>

1329
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:19.760
<v Speaker 4>There is no classified material.</v>
<v Speaker 4>110 emails.</v>

1330
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:22.183
<v Speaker 4>Email chains have been determined by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>owning agency to contains classified </v>

1331
00:51:26.091 --> 00:51:29.690
<v Speaker 4>information at the time they were sent </v>
<v Speaker 4>or received.</v>

1332
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:34.670
<v Speaker 4>I provided all my emails that could </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly be work related,</v>

1333
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:39.730
<v Speaker 4>several thousand work related emails </v>
<v Speaker 4>that were not among the group of 30,000</v>

1334
00:51:40.401 --> 00:51:41.234
<v Speaker 4>emails returned by Secretary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought using one device would be </v>

1335
00:51:44.361 --> 00:51:45.194
<v Speaker 4>simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She also use numerous mobile devices to </v>

1336
00:51:47.901 --> 00:51:48.734
<v Speaker 4>send in to read email.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were no security breaches you'd </v>

1337
00:51:52.311 --> 00:51:55.900
<v Speaker 4>use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Possible hostile actors gained access to</v>

1338
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:57.550
<v Speaker 4>secretary Clinton's personal email.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kevin.</v>

1339
00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:58.413
<v Speaker 4>It was my practice to communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 4>State Department and other government </v>

1340
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.710
<v Speaker 4>officials on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dot Gov accounts.</v>

1341
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:05.623
<v Speaker 4>Hostile actors gained access to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>private commercial email accounts of </v>

1342
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:12.230
<v Speaker 4>people was home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Secretary Clinton was in regular contact</v>

1343
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.090
<v Speaker 4>from her personal account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1344
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:17.330
<v Speaker 4>no doubt that we've done exactly what we</v>
<v Speaker 4>should have done.</v>

1345
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:21.530
<v Speaker 4>They were extremely careless handling a </v>
<v Speaker 4>very sensitive,</v>

1346
00:52:21.531 --> 00:52:23.160
<v Speaker 4>highly classified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is dre,</v>

1347
00:52:23.161 --> 00:52:25.100
<v Speaker 4>nicely structured and judge for </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

1348
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:26.413
<v Speaker 4>We cannot find a case that would support</v>
<v Speaker 4>bringing criminal charges on these </v>

1349
00:52:30.021 --> 00:52:34.490
<v Speaker 4>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To be clear.</v>

1350
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:38.090
<v Speaker 4>This is not to suggest that in similar </v>
<v Speaker 4>circumstances,</v>

1351
00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.230
<v Speaker 4>a person who engaged in this activity </v>
<v Speaker 4>would face no consequences.</v>

1352
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:44.750
<v Speaker 4>Americans will find that to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1353
00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:45.733
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I look forward to having a </v>

1354
00:52:47.541 --> 00:52:50.230
<v Speaker 4>discussion about them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nice.</v>

1355
00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a crook.</v>

1356
00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.553
<v Speaker 2>She a crooked hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crooked Hillary as the sainted God </v>

1357
00:52:56.921 --> 00:52:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Emperor Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>

1358
00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:00.230
<v Speaker 2>that's just a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1359
00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.393
<v Speaker 2>you know that is just a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aren't you looking forward to the </v>

1360
00:53:02.771 --> 00:53:05.140
<v Speaker 2>debates though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I am,</v>

1361
00:53:05.141 --> 00:53:07.500
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is like he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Crucey,</v>

1362
00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:12.190
<v Speaker 2>he starts name calling and all the jazz </v>
<v Speaker 2>that goes along with that.</v>

1363
00:53:12.191 --> 00:53:14.530
<v Speaker 2>And he says preposterous things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico,</v>

1364
00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:15.753
<v Speaker 2>about them being a bunch of rapists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>next thing you know he didn't say that </v>

1365
00:53:18.881 --> 00:53:23.881
<v Speaker 2>someone's doing the rabbit said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never said that puncture of rapists.</v>

1366
00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Well he didn't say it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1367
00:53:25.501 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 2>he said Mexico</v>

1368
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.053
<v Speaker 1>is not sending as best people and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the people who come over are </v>

1369
00:53:29.221 --> 00:53:31.380
<v Speaker 1>rapists and criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all true.</v>

1370
00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:34.860
<v Speaker 1>And what has happened since the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounce the the conservative press has</v>

1371
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:37.980
<v Speaker 1>been more alert and awake to this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been and been reimbursed.</v>

1372
00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:39.540
<v Speaker 1>And if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it,</v>

1373
00:53:39.541 --> 00:53:40.374
<v Speaker 1>we're finding these guys that are caught</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a cleaner court for raping and </v>

1374
00:53:42.451 --> 00:53:44.700
<v Speaker 1>killing and stealing things and they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been deported six times.</v>

1375
00:53:44.701 --> 00:53:45.301
<v Speaker 1>We're finding all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1376
00:53:45.301 --> 00:53:46.134
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this poor girl got murdered by an </v>

1377
00:53:46.921 --> 00:53:48.210
<v Speaker 1>immigrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been deported four times.</v>

1378
00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:50.790
<v Speaker 1>He's not wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not like the way he says it,</v>

1379
00:53:50.791 --> 00:53:51.624
<v Speaker 1>but he's not wrong the way as it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely problematic and it really </v>

1380
00:53:53.851 --> 00:53:54.684
<v Speaker 1>hurts the people that x size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that word from your vocal problematic </v>

1381
00:53:57.970 --> 00:53:59.880
<v Speaker 1>because it's don't you know it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive word.</v>

1382
00:53:59.881 --> 00:54:00.714
<v Speaker 1>That's what they sound campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually I find what you're saying </v>

1383
00:54:02.161 --> 00:54:02.994
<v Speaker 1>really problem.</v>

1384
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.231
<v Speaker 1>You need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1385
00:54:04.231 --> 00:54:05.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>

1386
00:54:05.641 --> 00:54:08.130
<v Speaker 1>You need to get rid of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to get rid of this a problem.</v>

1387
00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:13.050
<v Speaker 1>And when you can communicate and that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a social justice dog whistle.</v>

1388
00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:15.540
<v Speaker 1>When people sit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people hear you say problematic,</v>

1389
00:54:15.541 --> 00:54:19.680
<v Speaker 1>they think saying that word feminism </v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic was ever I know.</v>

1390
00:54:19.681 --> 00:54:22.470
<v Speaker 1>But language language sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerates past us.</v>

1391
00:54:22.471 --> 00:54:23.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>can have a fast pass for gay,</v>

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:42.180
<v Speaker 1>but people are not going to accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could use it.</v>

1398
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.890
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone told me,</v>

1399
00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:47.690
<v Speaker 1>I had a discussion because I called my </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog a faggot and one of my,</v>

1400
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.240
<v Speaker 1>one of my comedy specials and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>

1401
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:53.100
<v Speaker 1>it was a stupid bit.</v>

1402
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.470
<v Speaker 1>And the guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where it was really,</v>

1403
00:54:55.471 --> 00:54:56.790
<v Speaker 1>it was a comedy central guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1404
00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.370
<v Speaker 1>only we can use that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

1405
00:54:59.371 --> 00:55:00.570
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1406
00:55:00.571 --> 00:55:01.620
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's our nigger.</v>

1407
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.270
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the gay shit I've ever heard.</v>

1408
00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1409
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:08.190
<v Speaker 1>but that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1410
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:10.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a real conversation I had with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real person.</v>

1411
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.210
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with all of this.</v>

1412
00:55:12.211 --> 00:55:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I think boards should be liberated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you liberate them,</v>

1413
00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:16.710
<v Speaker 1>you rob them of their ability to hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1414
00:55:16.711 --> 00:55:19.440
<v Speaker 1>You rob them of their ability to wound </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you stop giving them power.</v>

1415
00:55:19.441 --> 00:55:23.490
<v Speaker 1>And more important than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't just rob racist,</v>

1416
00:55:23.491 --> 00:55:24.324
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and homophobic of a word in their </v>

1417
00:55:26.071 --> 00:55:29.040
<v Speaker 1>arsenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you also rob social justice warriors</v>

1418
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:30.023
<v Speaker 1>of the ability to bully and police and </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly shame people for using loads </v>

1419
00:55:33.391 --> 00:55:34.650
<v Speaker 1>that are fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1420
00:55:34.651 --> 00:55:35.484
<v Speaker 1>the problem is when you give words </v>
<v Speaker 1>magical powers and so words are about </v>

1421
00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:39.334
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>

1422
00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:41.160
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know,</v>

1423
00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:43.800
<v Speaker 1>when someone does like what was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis Ck joke?</v>

1424
00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:45.001
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1425
00:55:45.001 --> 00:55:45.834
<v Speaker 1>what if someone's just being a faggot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows he doesn't have anything to do </v>

1426
00:55:48.091 --> 00:55:48.924
<v Speaker 1>with being gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like did you know the people from </v>

1430
00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:58.770
<v Speaker 1>I recorded episode of my show yesterday </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Ann Coulter and she said,</v>

1431
00:55:58.771 --> 00:55:59.820

<v Speaker 1>I hope you don't mean homosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you mean gay in its prestige,</v>

1433
00:56:02.941 --> 00:56:05.130
<v Speaker 1>meaning in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is rubbish,</v>

<v Speaker 1>lame crap.</v>

<v Speaker 1>charming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>

1440
00:56:19.951 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 1>blonde haired British immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Donald Trump's rapists,</v>

1441

<v Speaker 1>it's got nothing to do.</v>

1444
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:30.640
<v Speaker 1>It's got nothing to do with skin color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about culture.</v>

1445
00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:32.220
<v Speaker 1>It's about culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're,</v>

1446
00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:33.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what's happening in item of </v>

1447
00:56:35.591 --> 00:56:37.900
<v Speaker 1>all people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with brown skin,</v>

1448
00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.270
<v Speaker 1>but as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1449
00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:42.820
<v Speaker 1>it's about culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you import,</v>

1450
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:43.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an,</v>

1451
00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.630
<v Speaker 1>as happening in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these barbaric,</v>

1452
00:56:46.631 --> 00:56:47.890
<v Speaker 1>medieval,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1453
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:50.500
<v Speaker 1>attitudes to women and gays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad things happen.</v>

1454
00:56:50.501 --> 00:56:51.334
<v Speaker 1>And actually that doesn't just service </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the barbarians and that is a real </v>

1455
00:56:53.831 --> 00:56:54.664
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1456
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:57.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's a problem that the left just </v>
<v Speaker 1>does not want to face it.</v>

1457
00:56:57.701 --> 00:57:00.370
<v Speaker 1>That there are cultures dislike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some of the,</v>

1458
00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're terrible people in all cultures,</v>

1459
00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:03.934
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can all,</v>

1460
00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:07.300
<v Speaker 1>there are cultures that are not as good </v>
<v Speaker 1>as ours,</v>

1461
00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:08.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Briefly,</v>

1462
00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:08.843
<v Speaker 1>system choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't import them here at our </v>

1463
00:57:10.991 --> 00:57:13.960
<v Speaker 1>prison system is filled with people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have done terrible things,</v>

1464
00:57:13.961 --> 00:57:14.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1465
00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:15.760
<v Speaker 1>So even in the best country in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1466
00:57:15.761 --> 00:57:18.250
<v Speaker 1>there are people in this country that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have done terrible things,</v>

1467
00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:19.593
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a general attitude about women </v>

1468
00:57:22.181 --> 00:57:23.014
<v Speaker 1>in the Middle East that has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>supported by the people that are in </v>

1469
00:57:26.441 --> 00:57:31.120
<v Speaker 1>charge of the countries like Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabia where the women could not drive.</v>

1470
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:32.220
<v Speaker 1>It's endemic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1471
00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:33.460
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with them on.</v>

1472
00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:35.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes no,</v>

1473
00:57:35.951 --> 00:57:36.221
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1474
00:57:36.221 --> 00:57:37.054
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes sometimes good things can </v>

1475
00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:39.790
<v Speaker 1>happen for bad reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1476
00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:42.210
<v Speaker 1>and the chicks don't drive accidentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone.</v>

1477
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:44.290
<v Speaker 1>They've accidentally stumbled on a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule.</v>

1478
00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Women should not be behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heterosexual male.</v>

1479
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:48.663
<v Speaker 1>If a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a girl to come over my house and </v>

1483
00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.073
<v Speaker 1>then you should have some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sorts of disreputable midnight </v>

1484
00:58:00.341 --> 00:58:01.174
<v Speaker 1>trust someone.</v>

1485
00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's good to be able to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>good old carriage for her.</v>

1486
00:58:05.021 --> 00:58:06.880
<v Speaker 1>She comes over with their own pillow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Without own pillar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good girl.</v>

<v Speaker 1>obviously some girls like jerome pillow,</v>

1489
00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:12.923

<v Speaker 1>No guy comes over a girl's house or own </v>

1490
00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:18.690
<v Speaker 1>pillar.</v>

1494
00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:26.763

<v Speaker 1>I should start taking my own pillows </v>

1495
00:58:28.181 --> 00:58:29.014
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad idea because I sleep in </v>

<v Speaker 1>my own bed about three days every two </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

1497
00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:33.430

<v Speaker 1>it's like such a luxurious experience to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be at home watching that much.</v>

1531
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:52.370
<v Speaker 1>Nigel Faraj,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a hat on who looks British,</v>

1532
00:59:53.330 --> 00:59:55.250

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:02.883
<v Speaker 1>And indeed this has gone viral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He explained in his words as to why the </v>

1536
01:00:08.811 --> 01:00:12.200
<v Speaker 1>brexit happened and he sat down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he educated them,</v>

1537
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:15.980
<v Speaker 1>he tried to enlighten them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddy also made it staying just a little</v>

<v Speaker 1>let's roll clip one.</v>

1541
01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.380
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it funny?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

1542
01:00:23.381 --> 01:00:24.214
<v Speaker 5>I came here 17 years ago and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I wanted to lead a campaign to get </v>

1543
01:00:29.741 --> 01:00:34.360
<v Speaker 5>Britain to leave the European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You all laughed at me.</v>

1544
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:37.700
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to say you're not laughing now,</v>

1545
01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.320
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1546
01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this reminds me of a great,</v>

1547
01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we pause this for a second?</v>

1548
01:00:52.611 --> 01:00:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It reminds me of a great,</v>

1549
01:00:54.351 --> 01:00:56.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a monk monkhouse joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1550
01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.730
<v Speaker 1>he said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1551
01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:00.400
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago I told you I was all going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

1552
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.360
<v Speaker 1>I told you all I was going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian.</v>

1553
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's laughing now.</v>

1554
01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:07.430
<v Speaker 3>It gets crazy to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get,</v>

1555
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.030
<v Speaker 3>they go deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is this?</v>

1556
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:11.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love that.</v>

1557
01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what you say about him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that man is a p.</v>

1558
01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.070
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>M.</v>

1559
01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:16.903
<v Speaker 3>P.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1560
01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.490
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's laughing now spelling that out </v>
<v Speaker 3>in my head.</v>

1561
01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:21.830
<v Speaker 3>You expect this fragment to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

1562
01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:26.323
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to people who are far more </v>

1563
01:01:27.201 --> 01:01:28.034
<v Speaker 3>authoritative on the brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of like the UK with the </v>

1564
01:01:30.381 --> 01:01:31.790
<v Speaker 3>American election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's entertainment.</v>

1565
01:01:31.791 --> 01:01:32.810
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been a,</v>

1566
01:01:32.811 --> 01:01:33.644
<v Speaker 3>it's been an intense few weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is last week of cultural </v>

1567
01:01:35.811 --> 01:01:36.644
<v Speaker 3>appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moms,</v>

1568
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:38.900
<v Speaker 3>brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good on you guys.</v>

1569
01:01:38.901 --> 01:01:42.560
<v Speaker 3>You got some independent chair going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be entertained this evening.</v>

1570
01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.753
<v Speaker 3>Sons,</v>

1571
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>we have some other clips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't we ask them a clip?</v>

1572
01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:49.190
<v Speaker 1>We have some more clips where he sat </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and he talked to them about,</v>

1573
01:01:49.191 --> 01:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he just read them the riot act.</v>

1574
01:01:51.561 --> 01:01:52.200
<v Speaker 1>So let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

1575
01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.033
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get to some of the substance of </v>

1576
01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.610
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his comments were all the next clip.</v>

1577
01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:56.673
<v Speaker 5>But what I would like to see is a grown </v>
<v Speaker 5>up and sensible attitude to how we </v>

1578
01:02:01.991 --> 01:02:06.991
<v Speaker 5>negotiate a different relationship now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I know,</v>

1579
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:12.940
<v Speaker 5>I know that virtually none of you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever done a proper job in your lives.</v>

1580
01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:18.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1581
01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1582
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:22.010
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like Tim.</v>

1583
01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:25.100
<v Speaker 2>He's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1584
01:02:25.101 --> 01:02:25.934
<v Speaker 2>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a real issue with politicians </v>

1585
01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:33.350
<v Speaker 2>and also university teachers of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it gets worse than that.</v>

1586
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Professors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>universities,</v>

1587
01:02:36.571 --> 01:02:37.404
<v Speaker 2>it's worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It used to be the case in America that </v>

1588
01:02:40.081 --> 01:02:42.870
<v Speaker 2>the faculty ruled the roost and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>faculty,</v>

1589
01:02:42.871 --> 01:02:43.704
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could pretty much do what they wanted </v>

1590
01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:45.894
<v Speaker 2>and colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the balance of power has shifted in </v>

1591
01:02:47.071 --> 01:02:48.960
<v Speaker 2>American universities now toward </v>
<v Speaker 2>administrators.</v>

1592
01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.093
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it basically the people who run the </v>

1593
01:02:50.521 --> 01:02:55.080
<v Speaker 2>money because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because universities are now giant,</v>

1594
01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.153
<v Speaker 2>partly taxpayer funded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly government owned businesses that </v>

1595
01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:03.910
<v Speaker 2>need to bring in donations and need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1596
01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:08.510
<v Speaker 2>keep the admissions numbers up and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these gigantic campuses.</v>

1597
01:03:08.511 --> 01:03:09.344
<v Speaker 2>We'd luxurious facilities and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of education is taking very much a </v>

1598
01:03:11.161 --> 01:03:11.994
<v Speaker 2>back seat to the business of providing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>home or even as some people want a safe </v>

1599
01:03:16.021 --> 01:03:19.740
<v Speaker 2>space away from home for four years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>charging vast fees to do it.</v>

1600
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.100
<v Speaker 2>That becomes sort of holiday camps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very well appointed holiday camps.</v>

1601
01:03:23.101 --> 01:03:25.800
<v Speaker 2>The people with the power now in </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities or the administrators.</v>

1602
01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:26.663
<v Speaker 2>And to be a university administrator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to know even less than to be a </v>

1603
01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:30.420
<v Speaker 2>professor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to really,</v>

1604
01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:31.081
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

1605
01:03:31.081 --> 01:03:31.914
<v Speaker 2>it's almost compulsory to go through </v>
<v Speaker 2>life with a cluster of conspiracy </v>

1606
01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:35.244
<v Speaker 2>theories in a victimhood and grievance </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and total ignorance of history </v>

1607
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:39.463
<v Speaker 2>to run a university in America now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have to pander to and </v>

1608
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:45.210
<v Speaker 2>believe a variety of things that simply </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't true.</v>

1609
01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.280
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about campus rape culture.</v>

1610
01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:48.323
<v Speaker 2>You need to not only enable but fund </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist groups on campus and all sorts </v>

1611
01:03:53.221 --> 01:03:55.730
<v Speaker 2>of an a variety and the diversity office</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the women's,</v>

1612
01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:56.564
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the women's studies department and </v>

1613
01:03:57.630 --> 01:03:58.463
<v Speaker 2>this Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these things that are happening on </v>

1614
01:03:59.611 --> 01:04:00.540
<v Speaker 2>campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1615
01:04:00.541 --> 01:04:01.374
<v Speaker 2>putting other kids tuition fees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting the tuition fees are people who </v>

1616
01:04:03.481 --> 01:04:04.314
<v Speaker 2>are studying engineering and maths and </v>
<v Speaker 2>physics into academic departments and </v>

1617
01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:09.474
<v Speaker 2>student services and all sorts of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that simply peddle lies to </v>

1618
01:04:12.931 --> 01:04:13.710
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

1619
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:14.543
<v Speaker 2>They are spreading conspiracy theories </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on shoddy advocacy research and </v>

1620
01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:19.603
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barmy social social science nonsense </v>

1621
01:04:22.621 --> 01:04:25.530
<v Speaker 2>from the 1970s and filling it </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable,</v>

1622
01:04:25.531 --> 01:04:26.970
<v Speaker 2>impressionable young people's heads with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1623
01:04:26.971 --> 01:04:29.400
<v Speaker 2>And it is obscene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of conspiracy theory?</v>

1624
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:30.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the patriarchy,</v>

1625
01:04:30.811 --> 01:04:33.210
<v Speaker 2>the patriarch is a conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Patriarchy is the,</v>

1626
01:04:33.211 --> 01:04:33.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1627
01:04:33.641 --> 01:04:35.730
<v Speaker 2>is an idea of dreamt up by feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basic,</v>

1628
01:04:35.731 --> 01:04:36.564
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it really boils down to is my life </v>

1629
01:04:39.091 --> 01:04:40.360
<v Speaker 2>is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the,</v>

1630
01:04:40.361 --> 01:04:41.194
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing I don't like about Bernie </v>

1631
01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:42.744
<v Speaker 2>supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go to the world and they start on </v>

1632
01:04:44.461 --> 01:04:47.040
<v Speaker 2>this basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my life's bad.</v>

1633
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.113
<v Speaker 2>Who's to blame for it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which of you are at fault for my life </v>

1634
01:04:51.181 --> 01:04:53.730
<v Speaker 2>not being as good as I want it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is the,</v>

1635
01:04:53.731 --> 01:04:55.590
<v Speaker 2>the victim hood in grievance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of politics of,</v>

1636
01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:56.463
<v Speaker 2>of the social justice left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly then sort of middle and </v>

1637
01:04:57.871 --> 01:04:58.704
<v Speaker 2>upper middle class social justice left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now these women's studies departments </v>

1638
01:05:01.051 --> 01:05:02.880
<v Speaker 2>tell young girls if there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong in your life.</v>

1639
01:05:02.881 --> 01:05:04.530
<v Speaker 2>We were miserably unhappy and anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever bad,</v>

1640
01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:07.500
<v Speaker 2>anything bad ever happens to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the patriarchy.</v>

1641
01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:11.520
<v Speaker 2>It's this sort of voldemort s conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory that can explain everything.</v>

1642
01:05:11.521 --> 01:05:12.354
<v Speaker 2>And of course as anybody with any sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>who actually reads books knows that any </v>

1643
01:05:14.701 --> 01:05:17.770
<v Speaker 2>explanation that's a bit too good to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>true generally is.</v>

1644
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:21.070
<v Speaker 1>And the Patriarchy in fact does not </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain any of the things that are wrong</v>

1645
01:05:21.071 --> 01:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>in women's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the real data,</v>

1646
01:05:23.171 --> 01:05:24.820
<v Speaker 1>you discover that if there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy,</v>

1647
01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>it ain't doing a very good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1648
01:05:26.651 --> 01:05:29.640
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know 97% of workplace fatalities are</v>

1649
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>male men have fallen behind in </v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

1650
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:32.673
<v Speaker 1>There is no wage gap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact women have a huge </v>

1651
01:05:34.601 --> 01:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>competitive advantage going for many </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>

1652
01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:36.791
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1653
01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:38.440
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who's listened to us regularly,</v>

1654
01:05:38.441 --> 01:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>we'll know all this stuff by heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

1655
01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:41.253
<v Speaker 1>but let's explain the web get wage gap </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because it's one of the things </v>

1656
01:05:43.091 --> 01:05:44.530
<v Speaker 1>that gets trumped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trumpeted out,</v>

1657
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.850
<v Speaker 1>trumped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trumpeted out,</v>

1658
01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.160
<v Speaker 1>tried a bit from where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people don't,</v>

1659
01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I get a semi just at the sound of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word now you don't understand.</v>

1660
01:05:50.810 --> 01:05:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Told The New York Times I was trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual and I was trolling them,</v>

1661
01:05:53.201 --> 01:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>but they saw that I was trolling them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they printed it.</v>

1662
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recognize the troll.</v>

1663
01:05:58.890 --> 01:05:59.723
<v Speaker 1>And I think they did too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they are obligated to do you </v>

1664
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:03.400
<v Speaker 1>personally find Donald Trump sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction on it?</v>

1665
01:06:03.401 --> 01:06:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trump's actual,</v>

1666
01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.950
<v Speaker 1>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1667
01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they know what to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1668
01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:10.443
<v Speaker 1>but that's beside the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's explained what the issue is with </v>

1669
01:06:13.451 --> 01:06:14.710
<v Speaker 1>the wage gap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1670
01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>So there's two ways to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1671
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:17.823
<v Speaker 1>one of them involves a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>economics and people at home sometimes </v>

1672
01:06:19.811 --> 01:06:23.230
<v Speaker 1>like Uconn deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but steals dirty math is what it is.</v>

1673
01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:25.180
<v Speaker 1>They start taking you be checking on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1674
01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:26.580
<v Speaker 1>but listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're at home and you're thinking,</v>

1675
01:06:26.581 --> 01:06:27.414
<v Speaker 1>I really can't be bothered with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>buck the fuck up 75 cents to every </v>

1676
01:06:32.201 --> 01:06:34.150
<v Speaker 1>dollar of lies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lies,</v>

1677
01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:35.043
<v Speaker 1>lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are of course reasons why men </v>

1678
01:06:37.871 --> 01:06:40.990
<v Speaker 1>and women may have different roles in </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

1679
01:06:40.991 --> 01:06:42.400
<v Speaker 1>In some of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

1680
01:06:42.401 --> 01:06:43.360
<v Speaker 1>let's pick an example.</v>

1681
01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:44.463
<v Speaker 1>Mendham bear children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now of course the left is trying to </v>

1682
01:06:46.641 --> 01:06:47.021
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>

1683
01:06:47.021 --> 01:06:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry to go off track.</v>

1684
01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.960
<v Speaker 1>This is how my brain works is I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 1>scattered,</v>

1685
01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.113
<v Speaker 1>but the Guardian in June,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just so this other story about </v>

1686
01:06:53.831 --> 01:06:54.664
<v Speaker 1>this guy who was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try this trans guy trying to breastfeed </v>

1687
01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his quote was like,</v>

1688
01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.710
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1689
01:06:59.711 --> 01:07:00.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1690
01:07:00.551 --> 01:07:02.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not children don't know what gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

1691
01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:04.383
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was someone was like an </v>

1692
01:07:06.581 --> 01:07:07.970
<v Speaker 1>onion type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1693
01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:09.080
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1694
01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:11.660
<v Speaker 1>it's the guy with glasses that has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby on his tail.</v>

1695
01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started laughing when I saw that.</v>

1696
01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:17.170
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like an almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly Canadian.</v>

1697
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could look it up.</v>

1698
01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:22.780
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't put a lot of money on it,</v>

1699
01:07:22.781 --> 01:07:23.680
<v Speaker 1>but I put a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's,</v>

1700
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.540
<v Speaker 1>let's get quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:45.790
<v Speaker 1>So he was born a woman then that it is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman who knows.</v>

<v Speaker 1>which means hormones and is now becoming</v>

<v Speaker 1>female.</v>

1716

<v Speaker 1>He's a man to demand where we have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1717
01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:07.053
<v Speaker 1>Now he is a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even refer to him as a former </v>

1718
01:08:08.891 --> 01:08:09.611
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I've worn the female garb and I've worn </v>
<v Speaker 1>the male garb.</v>

1734
01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Men Don't know they're born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get so many.</v>

1735
01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:51.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I walked through life as a man,</v>

1736
01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.970
<v Speaker 1>people treated me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1737
01:08:52.971 --> 01:08:53.804
<v Speaker 1>perfectly normally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now people look at me very </v>

1738
01:08:55.581 --> 01:08:56.120
<v Speaker 1>strangely.</v>

1739
01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:01.120
<v Speaker 1>It took every ounce of my self control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to say you're a man in a dress.</v>

1740
01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.353
<v Speaker 1>Of course they look at you weirdly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're terrifying when babies cry at </v>

1741
01:09:05.931 --> 01:09:06.764
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not crying because they're </v>

1742
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:08.203
<v Speaker 1>transphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're crying because you look </v>

1743
01:09:09.081 --> 01:09:09.914
<v Speaker 1>horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see Caitlin Jenner or brew </v>

1744
01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:14.420
<v Speaker 1>install bruce?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1745
01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:15.261
<v Speaker 1>Bruce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1746
01:09:15.261 --> 01:09:19.360
<v Speaker 1>How style at Breitbart is to insist on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce when ellen was grilling here,</v>

1747
01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:22.640
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him know about gay marriage.</v>

1748
01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:24.920
<v Speaker 1>And then she was saying she's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditionalist.</v>

1749
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1750
01:09:25.730 --> 01:09:26.563
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's why the missional girl </v>

1751
01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:33.890
<v Speaker 1>fucking rubber face or face can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She shouted up full of Botox.</v>

1752
01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.033
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck ever happened to loving </v>

1753
01:09:37.101 --> 01:09:39.500
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what confuses the shit out of me.</v>

1754
01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:40.493
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's self harm extended out into the </v>

1755
01:09:41.721 --> 01:09:42.554
<v Speaker 1>rest of your life because you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up a razor blade when you were 15 </v>

1756
01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:46.200
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids cut yourself.</v>

1757
01:09:46.230 --> 01:09:46.551
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>

1758
01:09:46.551 --> 01:09:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's something very bizarre about</v>

1759
01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:50.663
<v Speaker 1>in collage exoticness hormones into </v>
<v Speaker 1>their body and getting their chin </v>

1760
01:09:55.041 --> 01:09:57.950
<v Speaker 1>slashed off so that they look more like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a man or a woman.</v>

1761
01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:58.813
<v Speaker 1>I very firmly believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very firmly believe that we will look </v>

1762
01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:03.614
<v Speaker 1>back on this period in time like we do </v>
<v Speaker 1>now on Victorian electroshock therapy </v>

1763
01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:11.960
<v Speaker 1>and wonder how we could ever have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>so monstrously callous as to allow these</v>

1764
01:10:11.961 --> 01:10:15.320
<v Speaker 1>people who have mental mental illnesses </v>
<v Speaker 1>to mutilate their bodies.</v>

1765
01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:20.560
<v Speaker 1>And of course how idiotic and and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian it was of us to expect the</v>

1766
01:10:21.921 --> 01:10:22.754
<v Speaker 1>taxpayers to pick up the bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that gets really weird for </v>

1767
01:10:24.891 --> 01:10:25.670
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1768
01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:28.610
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if somebody wants to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's their body,</v>

1769
01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.280
<v Speaker 1>I have no right whatsoever to tell them </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't do.</v>

1770
01:10:31.281 --> 01:10:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

1771
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.220
<v Speaker 1>But it is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do is you should,</v>

1772
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:39.910
<v Speaker 1>why should I be so stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My God?</v>

1773
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Anybody be able to tell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just let it do it.</v>

1774
01:10:42.711 --> 01:10:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares,</v>

1775
01:10:43.671 --> 01:10:44.504
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1776
01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.753
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

1777
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.890
<v Speaker 1>We don't allow people with mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>illnesses on the whole to live out their</v>

1778
01:10:51.891 --> 01:10:54.140
<v Speaker 1>delusions excepted when it isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical interest.</v>

1779
01:10:54.141 --> 01:10:56.570
<v Speaker 1>When we do what is mental illness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1780
01:10:56.571 --> 01:10:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a person's pays their bills,</v>

1781
01:10:59.031 --> 01:11:00.920
<v Speaker 1>they're nice to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They functioned normally,</v>

1782
01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:03.180
<v Speaker 1>they pay their taxes and for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1783
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:07.310
<v Speaker 1>they want to be a man to man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they want to be one tough.</v>

1784
01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.300
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a serious answer to this,</v>

1785
01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 1>which is that it is by no clear,</v>

1786
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.170
<v Speaker 2>and you wouldn't know this just by </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading the media,</v>

1787
01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.273
<v Speaker 2>but it is by no means clear that that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most effective and humane treatment </v>

1788
01:11:20.161 --> 01:11:22.070
<v Speaker 2>pathway for people with this particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

1789
01:11:22.150 --> 01:11:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greed is not clear at all.</v>

1790
01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:25.343
<v Speaker 2>Now what we should be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you just want some sort of </v>

1791
01:11:28.021 --> 01:11:28.831
<v Speaker 2>chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaotic,</v>

1792
01:11:28.831 --> 01:11:29.340
<v Speaker 2>free for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1793
01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The easy argument,</v>

1794
01:11:30.431 --> 01:11:31.264
<v Speaker 2>that easy libertarian argument is let </v>
<v Speaker 2>people do what they want themselves to </v>

1795
01:11:33.291 --> 01:11:35.250
<v Speaker 2>not hurting anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't make the taxpayer pay for it.</v>

1796
01:11:35.251 --> 01:11:35.941
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1797
01:11:35.941 --> 01:11:36.774
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

1798
01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:38.400
<v Speaker 2>But my natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1799
01:11:38.401 --> 01:11:42.450
<v Speaker 2>I think my compassion kicks in at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point and says to me,</v>

1800
01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:47.250
<v Speaker 2>do we want to allow people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally ill to mutilate themselves?</v>

1801
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:49.010
<v Speaker 2>If somebody was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1802
01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.153
<v Speaker 2>a schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would we give them the razor blade </v>

1803
01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:53.850
<v Speaker 2>they're asking for because they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hack off their own arm.</v>

1804
01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we would know what size?</v>

1805
01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Double e tits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they've got just,</v>

1806
01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:02.760
<v Speaker 2>just good Kukoc could sense that's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have a girl.</v>

1807
01:12:02.761 --> 01:12:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Gastric surgery is different.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's just plus.</v>

1809
01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.033
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's tending into the same kind of </v>

1810
01:12:09.181 --> 01:12:11.130
<v Speaker 2>disorder and we shouldn't let them do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that either.</v>

1811
01:12:11.131 --> 01:12:12.510
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there should be rules about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

1812
01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:13.410
<v Speaker 2>how big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go.</v>

<v Speaker 2>a little bit tit rules in this country.</v>

1814
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:18.390
<v Speaker 2>A little plastic surgery is just good </v>
<v Speaker 2>grooming.</v>

1815
01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.680
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1818
01:12:20.781 --> 01:12:22.920

1822
01:12:27.331 --> 01:12:28.680
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about the size of the breast.</v>

1823
01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:31.890
<v Speaker 2>It's about the mental state of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who wants to change their body.</v>

1824
01:12:31.891 --> 01:12:36.140

<v Speaker 2>Jessica Rabbit tits.</v>

1825

<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1830
01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:51.810
<v Speaker 2>It's because it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1836
01:13:00.771 --> 01:13:03.900
<v Speaker 2>but you should be allowed because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hot to you.</v>

1837
01:13:04.290 --> 01:13:06.060

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you shouldn't get them if you're a </v>

1853
01:13:38.221 --> 01:13:38.820
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1854
01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:39.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1855
01:13:39.751 --> 01:13:40.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Bruce has him,</v>

1856
01:13:40.741 --> 01:13:41.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has them now.</v>

1857
01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:42.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1858
01:13:42.841 --> 01:13:47.610
<v Speaker 2>That was the things about him as he went</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Diane Sawyer thing and said,</v>

1859
01:13:47.611 --> 01:13:50.270
<v Speaker 2>he still wants to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bruce still wants to be a him stolen.</v>

1860
01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:53.250
<v Speaker 2>So we called to him and then immediately</v>
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>

1861
01:13:53.251 --> 01:13:56.340
<v Speaker 2>because of all the attention gets his </v>
<v Speaker 2>jaw shave down,</v>

1862
01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.640
<v Speaker 2>has massive facial reconstruction </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery.</v>

1863
01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:00.713
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was instantaneously and changed his </v>

1864
01:14:02.791 --> 01:14:03.624
<v Speaker 2>name to Caitlyn and it was also right </v>
<v Speaker 2>after the Diane Sawyer injury or injury </v>

1865
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:10.583
<v Speaker 2>interview that he plowed into that lady </v>
<v Speaker 2>and center into oncoming traffic and </v>

1866
01:14:13.631 --> 01:14:15.310
<v Speaker 2>killed her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

1867
01:14:16.730 --> 01:14:17.860
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was,</v>

1868
01:14:17.861 --> 01:14:19.420
<v Speaker 2>he was that he was going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed.</v>

1869
01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:21.430
<v Speaker 2>I think he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was declared innocent of that.</v>

1870
01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:24.160
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean declared innocent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't,</v>

1871
01:14:24.161 --> 01:14:27.160
<v Speaker 2>he definitely wasn't the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't he acquitted of manslaughter?</v>

1872
01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.113
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean he's definitely taken us </v>

1873
01:14:30.190 --> 01:14:32.290
<v Speaker 2>being careless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely hit that car.</v>

1874
01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.780
<v Speaker 2>But of course he's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's insane.</v>

1875
01:14:34.781 --> 01:14:35.980
<v Speaker 2>He shouldn't be allowed behind the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheel.</v>

1876
01:14:35.981 --> 01:14:36.814
<v Speaker 2>He shouldn't be given guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He should not be given access to </v>

1877
01:14:38.231 --> 01:14:39.064
<v Speaker 2>surgeons struggling with the office face</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to make sounds with his mouth or </v>

1878
01:14:46.511 --> 01:14:50.390
<v Speaker 2>her mouth or would it look at this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you,</v>

1879
01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:52.600
<v Speaker 2>it's quite good in that dress frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1880
01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:56.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is that this is,</v>

1881
01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:57.491
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1882
01:14:57.491 --> 01:14:58.870
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an insane person.</v>

1883
01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:02.290
<v Speaker 2>This is a person whose mind is he needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy and well,</v>

1884
01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.153
<v Speaker 2>that's a person who grew up with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well existed with a bunch of incredibly </v>

1885
01:15:07.271 --> 01:15:08.104
<v Speaker 2>famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very powerful women and probably </v>

1886
01:15:09.851 --> 01:15:12.140
<v Speaker 2>secretly wanted to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them.</v>

1887
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I'm saying for sure for sure outside</v>

1888
01:15:16.031 --> 01:15:16.900
<v Speaker 2>of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1889
01:15:17.170 --> 01:15:18.003
<v Speaker 2>joking around is that it is by no means </v>
<v Speaker 2>clear that transition surgery is the </v>

1890
01:15:21.131 --> 01:15:22.240
<v Speaker 2>best route for these people.</v>

1891
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:24.640
<v Speaker 2>It does not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to all of the data we have,</v>

1892
01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:25.503
<v Speaker 2>all of the studies that it does not </v>
<v Speaker 2>significantly or at all really affects </v>

1893
01:15:29.261 --> 01:15:30.094
<v Speaker 2>suicide rates or depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What people who've had this surgery do </v>

1894
01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:33.780
<v Speaker 2>not get better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1895
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:36.520
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few of them do,</v>

1896
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:37.383
<v Speaker 2>but not many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And 40% of them who have it want it </v>

1897
01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:41.373
<v Speaker 2>reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My suggestion is shouldn't we just be a </v>

1898
01:15:43.391 --> 01:15:44.950
<v Speaker 2>bit more cautious about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1899
01:15:44.951 --> 01:15:45.784
<v Speaker 2>you are certainly saying some very uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative things about that in terms </v>

1900
01:15:51.251 --> 01:15:53.800
<v Speaker 2>of like how you should approach your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>body and your life,</v>

1901
01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.330
<v Speaker 2>like getting sexual reassignment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody,</v>

1902
01:15:56.370 --> 01:15:56.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want,</v>

1903
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.860
<v Speaker 2>you mean conservative like right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like cautious,</v>

1904
01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:01.023
<v Speaker 2>cautious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should be cautious before we </v>

1905
01:16:02.171 --> 01:16:03.004
<v Speaker 2>moved to they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our bodies because there's no coming </v>

1906
01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:04.684
<v Speaker 2>back from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of regret once you've </v>

1907
01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:07.600
<v Speaker 2>cut your cock off.</v>

1908
01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:08.510
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1909
01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:09.363
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything else in life you can reverse </v>

1910
01:16:10.810 --> 01:16:14.060
<v Speaker 2>your reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can restore within the hard work and</v>

1911
01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:14.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1912
01:16:14.850 --> 01:16:15.683
<v Speaker 2>and a commitment to read it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>redressing whatever wrongs you did to </v>

1913
01:16:18.311 --> 01:16:19.870
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Korea,</v>

1914
01:16:19.871 --> 01:16:22.960
<v Speaker 2>you can make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can fix almost anything in life.</v>

1915
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:24.123
<v Speaker 2>But you cut your genitals off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Biological reality is biological </v>

1916
01:16:26.651 --> 01:16:27.251
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1917
01:16:27.251 --> 01:16:29.040
<v Speaker 2>And you can fix almost anything else </v>
<v Speaker 2>about yourself,</v>

1918
01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:32.590
<v Speaker 2>almost anything else about your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are certain facts,</v>

1919
01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:35.950
<v Speaker 2>certain anatomical facts about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about men and women.</v>

1920
01:16:35.951 --> 01:16:37.810
<v Speaker 2>And once you cut that thing off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

1921
01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.273
<v Speaker 2>It's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just suggesting that maybe we </v>

1922
01:16:41.231 --> 01:16:42.670
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

1923
01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:45.430
<v Speaker 2>to children for start giving them </v>
<v Speaker 2>hormone therapy.</v>

1924
01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.910
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't allow people that should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>just standard.</v>

1925
01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.860
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if but yeah,</v>

1926
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:53.630
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if somebody with 1819 you know,</v>

1927
01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:54.753
<v Speaker 2>1819 years old and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know and have known for 10 years that </v>

1928
01:16:56.951 --> 01:16:57.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1929
01:16:57.911 --> 01:17:00.940
<v Speaker 2>would you let them change and stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I wanted to be married.</v>

1930
01:17:01.090 --> 01:17:03.970
<v Speaker 2>You'll frontal lobe isn't even fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>formed at that age.</v>

1931
01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:05.163
<v Speaker 2>You're not even really a person yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you are and you are a a </v>

1932
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.530
<v Speaker 2>burgeoning person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1933
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:15.500
<v Speaker 2>You are growing into the person you will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be and that's why you can abort them.</v>

1934
01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not really people yet.</v>

1935
01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>

1936
01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:27.110
<v Speaker 2>This level of software story has been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few.</v>

1937
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:31.680
<v Speaker 2>So you might be 800 plus podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 2>guests.</v>

1938
01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:32.523
<v Speaker 2>The first is someone said Sophos tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is unless you said it during the </v>

1939
01:17:34.751 --> 01:17:36.240
<v Speaker 2>last episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sophos stream.</v>

1940
01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.490
<v Speaker 2>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is this.</v>

1941
01:17:39.491 --> 01:17:41.320
<v Speaker 2>So it's the headline on Breitbart </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>

1942
01:17:41.321 --> 01:17:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan in favor of 18 year old </v>
<v Speaker 2>abortions or abortion.</v>

1943
01:17:44.890 --> 01:17:47.680
<v Speaker 2>How many weeks is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many weeks is 18 years?</v>

1944
01:17:47.681 --> 01:17:48.940
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm bad at math.</v>

1945
01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:50.320
<v Speaker 2>My issue is,</v>

1946
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:56.490
<v Speaker 6>wasn't there a time where we said you </v>
<v Speaker 6>should just love who you are,</v>

1947
01:17:56.850 --> 01:17:59.810
<v Speaker 6>like love who you are and if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these people do who you are.</v>

1948
01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:04.920
<v Speaker 6>But there's the big difference between x</v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of accepting who you are.</v>

1949
01:18:04.921 --> 01:18:07.440
<v Speaker 6>And there's some people that just have </v>
<v Speaker 6>unfortunate genetics,</v>

1950
01:18:07.441 --> 01:18:09.690
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's some people that may be wish</v>

1951
01:18:09.691 --> 01:18:10.524
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're a woman or made me wish there </v>

1952
01:18:11.131 --> 01:18:13.020
<v Speaker 6>was something else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's one thing between,</v>

1953
01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:17.070
<v Speaker 6>there's a difference between dressing up</v>
<v Speaker 6>or pretending,</v>

1954
01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.113
<v Speaker 6>but once you start getting into full on </v>
<v Speaker 6>injecting female hormones into a male's </v>

1955
01:18:23.131 --> 01:18:26.370
<v Speaker 6>body and changing things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then physical surgery,</v>

1956
01:18:26.670 --> 01:18:29.250
<v Speaker 6>I am not against it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I am.</v>

1957
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:31.110
<v Speaker 6>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm silly libertarian.</v>

1958
01:18:31.111 --> 01:18:31.944
<v Speaker 6>I feel like you should be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck you want to do with </v>

1959
01:18:33.901 --> 01:18:37.170
<v Speaker 6>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it is a very dangerous road.</v>

1960
01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:38.273
<v Speaker 6>And there's there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is a host of different people out </v>

1961
01:18:41.461 --> 01:18:43.590
<v Speaker 6>there that will tell you that they've </v>
<v Speaker 6>done it.</v>

1962
01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:45.510
<v Speaker 6>And it was a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was a huge mistake.</v>

1963
01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:47.430
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're all 40% of,</v>

1964
01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.273
<v Speaker 6>but no one has to address that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is something that the left never </v>

1965
01:18:50.221 --> 01:18:53.400
<v Speaker 6>wants to address in their embracing of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the transgender culture,</v>

1966
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.280
<v Speaker 6>which I embrace to do whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 6>you want to do.</v>

1967
01:18:56.281 --> 01:18:57.060
<v Speaker 6>I'll say it again.</v>

1968
01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:57.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1969
01:18:57.521 --> 01:18:59.490
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't get behind it because I see</v>

1970
01:18:59.491 --> 01:19:01.830
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it dishonest though too?</v>

1971
01:19:01.831 --> 01:19:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Never discussed those people that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>crucified is,</v>

1972
01:19:03.961 --> 01:19:04.771
<v Speaker 2>but for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1973
01:19:04.771 --> 01:19:07.920
<v Speaker 2>they forced us to take a moral position </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a medical issue,</v>

1974
01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a moral issue.</v>

1975
01:19:09.691 --> 01:19:10.524
<v Speaker 2>This is a medical issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it is the case that people have a </v>

1976
01:19:13.501 --> 01:19:16.640
<v Speaker 2>disorder or a condition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they have dysphoria,</v>

1977
01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:18.240
<v Speaker 2>whatever word they want to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it,</v>

1978
01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:21.990
<v Speaker 2>that means that they were born with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong brain in the wrong body.</v>

1979
01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:24.510
<v Speaker 2>Nevermind the fact that we're always </v>
<v Speaker 2>told that gender socialized,</v>

1980
01:19:24.511 --> 01:19:25.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or can apparently suddenly,</v>

1981
01:19:25.771 --> 01:19:26.604
<v Speaker 2>abruptly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can have a male brain such a </v>

1982
01:19:28.051 --> 01:19:28.884
<v Speaker 2>thing as a male brain and the leftist </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender as a social construct and last </v>

1983
01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:34.590
<v Speaker 2>year trends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which case you've got a male brain of</v>

1984
01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.000
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a load of crap.</v>

1985
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.920
<v Speaker 2>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people really expect us to believe</v>

1986
01:19:37.921 --> 01:19:38.754
<v Speaker 2>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that we have the same level </v>

1987
01:19:40.381 --> 01:19:41.214
<v Speaker 2>of cognitive dissonance that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that we are as dumb as they </v>

1988
01:19:43.621 --> 01:19:44.454
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that we don't think things </v>

1989
01:19:45.211 --> 01:19:47.850
<v Speaker 2>through like they don't think things </v>
<v Speaker 2>through what we do.</v>

1990
01:19:47.970 --> 01:19:48.803
<v Speaker 2>We do think these things through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so to most people that are home and </v>

1991
01:19:50.941 --> 01:19:51.774
<v Speaker 2>they are like told on the one hand if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they even bother to get this far into a </v>

1992
01:19:54.241 --> 01:19:55.074
<v Speaker 2>guardian editorial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know that gender is a social </v>

1993
01:19:57.121 --> 01:19:57.954
<v Speaker 2>construct and you know all of this kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of stuff and yet at the same time that </v>

1994
01:20:00.271 --> 01:20:01.104
<v Speaker 2>masculinity is toxic and at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time you can have a mat and the only </v>

1995
01:20:05.851 --> 01:20:08.340
<v Speaker 2>time you were allowed to feminine</v>

1996
01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:11.820
<v Speaker 1>virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really like sexy clothes,</v>

1997
01:20:11.821 --> 01:20:14.180
<v Speaker 1>short skirts as if you're chasing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trend.</v>

1998
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:17.900
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a trainee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a girl,</v>

1999
01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:19.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2000
01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so empowered.</v>

2001
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:21.763
<v Speaker 1>You're brave and fabulous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a stunning and brave is the phrase </v>

2002
01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:25.403
<v Speaker 1>stunning and brave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing heroic about cutting </v>

2003
01:20:29.581 --> 01:20:34.110
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your firefighter should get the pump off</v>

2004
01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:36.090
<v Speaker 1>and cutting their cocks off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2005
01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:41.250
<v Speaker 1>it's just strange that a woman who wears</v>
<v Speaker 1>short skirts and high heels and a lot of</v>

2006
01:20:41.251 --> 01:20:44.100
<v Speaker 1>makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a pay as long as you're a man,</v>

2007
01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:45.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as you're a married man,</v>

2008
01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:49.950
<v Speaker 1>you see where even better at being women</v>
<v Speaker 1>than women or women on deer.</v>

2009
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With Glamour magazine,</v>

2010
01:20:51.970 --> 01:20:54.480
<v Speaker 1>woman of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months after being a woman,</v>

2011
01:20:54.481 --> 01:20:55.314
<v Speaker 1>he one woman of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's bitches had been trying to </v>

2012
01:20:57.001 --> 01:21:00.750
<v Speaker 1>win that fucking award for this 30 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of good ladies out there.</v>

2013
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:03.090
<v Speaker 1>There's some good girls who missed out </v>
<v Speaker 1>on that.</v>

2014
01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything men can't do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're better.</v>

2015
01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:06.643
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had male cleaners and female </v>

2016
01:21:07.501 --> 01:21:08.820
<v Speaker 1>cleanest men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always better.</v>

2017
01:21:08.821 --> 01:21:11.640
<v Speaker 1>I've had male cooks and female coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Male cooks always better.</v>

2018
01:21:12.370 --> 01:21:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I mean?</v>

2019
01:21:13.771 --> 01:21:14.604
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem with a trans project</v>
<v Speaker 1>is profoundly sexist because you know </v>

2020
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:18.570
<v Speaker 1>the transplant and homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2021
01:21:18.571 --> 01:21:19.404
<v Speaker 1>because I've convinced to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transport is profoundly homophobia </v>

2022
01:21:22.121 --> 01:21:23.670
<v Speaker 1>because what it's telling parents right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

2023
01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:25.670
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the 40% of the one at route when</v>

2024
01:21:25.671 --> 01:21:28.170
<v Speaker 1>it reversed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and probably then some they're telling,</v>

2025
01:21:28.171 --> 01:21:29.004
<v Speaker 1>if you're a young boy and your feminine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you liked playing with barbies and </v>

2026
01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:34.710
<v Speaker 1>you're attracted to other boys and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in your confused child,</v>

2027
01:21:34.711 --> 01:21:37.290
<v Speaker 1>mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and your parents,</v>

2028
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:38.670
<v Speaker 1>dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal,</v>

2029
01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:40.770
<v Speaker 1>infested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infected,</v>

2030
01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:43.830
<v Speaker 1>intoxicated mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow this becomes,</v>

2031
01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.173
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must have really supposed to have </v>

2032
01:21:46.381 --> 01:21:47.430
<v Speaker 1>been a girl.</v>

2033
01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2034
01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:51.990
<v Speaker 1>they're just gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you leave these kids alone,</v>

2035
01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:52.853
<v Speaker 1>all the evidence suggests that they grew</v>
<v Speaker 1>up into perfectly well adjusted young </v>

2036
01:21:54.961 --> 01:21:57.030
<v Speaker 1>gay men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But instead we're telling them,</v>

2037
01:21:57.031 --> 01:21:57.864
<v Speaker 1>and is this also provides an escape </v>
<v Speaker 1>hatch for parents who can't cope with </v>

2038
01:22:00.601 --> 01:22:01.590
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that kids are gay,</v>

2039
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:03.630
<v Speaker 1>because what it says to them is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2040
01:22:03.631 --> 01:22:06.240
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't given birth to a queer.</v>

2041
01:22:06.570 --> 01:22:07.131
<v Speaker 1>You've just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2042
01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:09.210
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kid's got a disorder,</v>

2043
01:22:09.211 --> 01:22:10.044
<v Speaker 1>you should have had a daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this gets parents out of having to </v>

2044
01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:13.523
<v Speaker 1>like go through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the difficult a rigmarole on </v>

2045
01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:16.980
<v Speaker 1>their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what did I do to turn my son gay?</v>

2046
01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:17.993
<v Speaker 1>Well now you don't have to because now </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a disorder and now they're </v>

2047
01:22:19.771 --> 01:22:20.820
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2048
01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:26.030
<v Speaker 1>That's so homophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So homophobic and the trends thing is,</v>

2049
01:22:26.130 --> 01:22:28.850
<v Speaker 1>is profoundly anti women because all it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be demonstrating,</v>

2050
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:29.703
<v Speaker 1>and I mean the effect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least all it seems to be </v>

2051
01:22:30.811 --> 01:22:33.000
<v Speaker 1>demonstrating is that men are better at </v>
<v Speaker 1>being women than women are.</v>

2052
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:33.833
<v Speaker 1>And I no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look at Caitlyn Jenner woman of </v>

2053
01:22:38.341 --> 01:22:39.700
<v Speaker 1>the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't do it.</v>

2054
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:44.830
<v Speaker 1>It's bullshit award just because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much attention being put on a,</v>

2055
01:22:45.391 --> 01:22:47.430
<v Speaker 1>no one really thinks she did anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>fabulous.</v>

2056
01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:47.821
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2057
01:22:47.821 --> 01:22:50.790
<v Speaker 1>this isn't about all the women that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>done amazing things for women.</v>

2058
01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:53.030
<v Speaker 1>This is what the left does is it forces </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to take it.</v>

2059
01:22:53.031 --> 01:22:53.864
<v Speaker 1>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It forces you to take moral positions </v>

2060
01:22:55.890 --> 01:22:56.850
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2061
01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.010
<v Speaker 1>on medical issues in this case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2062
01:22:59.190 --> 01:23:00.023
<v Speaker 1>But it also makes you lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how you know the left thinks </v>

2063
01:23:01.771 --> 01:23:03.270
<v Speaker 1>it's one and it's getting over </v>
<v Speaker 1>confident,</v>

2064
01:23:03.271 --> 01:23:04.104
<v Speaker 1>which is why I'm winning on college </v>
<v Speaker 1>campuses because they've forgotten how </v>

2065
01:23:05.171 --> 01:23:06.004
<v Speaker 1>to argue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the left is getting over at comp </v>

2066
01:23:07.630 --> 01:23:11.860
<v Speaker 1>overconfident and he's making it is it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcing this stuff when people now,</v>

2067
01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:12.963
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to be a bigot and lose</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job and liberal newspaper column </v>

2068
01:23:14.711 --> 01:23:17.200
<v Speaker 1>and not be appear on TV anymore and </v>
<v Speaker 1>become persona non grata,</v>

2069
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:19.480
<v Speaker 1>you have to tell lies that you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't true,</v>

2070
01:23:19.481 --> 01:23:20.440
<v Speaker 1>that everybody knows aren't true.</v>

2071
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:21.880
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Caitlyn Jenner was a woman.</v>

2072
01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Nobody believes that no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the journalist who I,</v>

2073
01:23:25.050 --> 01:23:26.560
<v Speaker 1>he still has a penis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

2074

2075
01:23:27.131 --> 01:23:27.964
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's say it's even more </v>

2076
01:23:28.451 --> 01:23:30.660
<v Speaker 1>problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she's offensive.</v>

2077
01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:34.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you that problematic that </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take another trans person,</v>

2078
01:23:34.001 --> 01:23:35.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who's had everything.</v>

2079
01:23:35.201 --> 01:23:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who now has one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>hideous,</v>

2080
01:23:38.170 --> 01:23:40.750
<v Speaker 1>oozing inverted vaginas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2081
01:23:40.751 --> 01:23:41.584
<v Speaker 1>the surgery is terrific by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I describe it in detail to anybody </v>

2082
01:23:43.781 --> 01:23:46.000
<v Speaker 1>thinking of having this done to them on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>

2083
01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

2084
01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:47.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2085
01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:48.420
<v Speaker 1>even I haven't done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can Watch it.</v>

2086
01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:49.990
<v Speaker 1>No thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2087
01:23:50.670 --> 01:23:51.530
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2088
01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:54.400
<v Speaker 1>take a take a woman who has had all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2089
01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:55.253
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's had all the surgery or the woman </v>

2090
01:23:56.671 --> 01:23:58.480
<v Speaker 1>is living as a woman could almost pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>or does it?</v>

2091
01:23:58.810 --> 01:24:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Nobody believes it's a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the journalist writing the stories,</v>

2092
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:04.343
<v Speaker 1>not the doc.</v>

2093
01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop it.</v>

2094
01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:08.051
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know,</v>

2095
01:24:08.051 --> 01:24:08.884
<v Speaker 1>interesting little tidbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I might even have said this in </v>

2096
01:24:10.121 --> 01:24:10.954
<v Speaker 1>the last show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a long time ago and I'm sure </v>

2097
01:24:11.471 --> 01:24:12.304
<v Speaker 1>different people are listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know why so many trainings get </v>

2098
01:24:15.161 --> 01:24:15.781
<v Speaker 1>beaten up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause the,</v>

2099
01:24:15.781 --> 01:24:16.720
<v Speaker 1>the left is always saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2100
01:24:16.721 --> 01:24:17.554
<v Speaker 1>we gotta protect the Trans Community </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's like disproportionately </v>

2101
01:24:18.821 --> 01:24:19.840
<v Speaker 1>the victims of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2102
01:24:19.870 --> 01:24:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2103
01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:22.843
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why tranny prostitutes get beaten up so </v>

2104
01:24:24.671 --> 01:24:25.480
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2105
01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.313
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they lie and say that they're a </v>

2106
01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:31.210
<v Speaker 1>woman and the guy finds a penis and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd beat him up.</v>

2107
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:33.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they steal money.</v>

2108
01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:37.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they what did the first one that gave us</v>

2109
01:24:37.541 --> 01:24:39.250
<v Speaker 1>a much obvious explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't the reason.</v>

2110
01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:40.773
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean men aren't dumb when they see a </v>

2111
01:24:42.971 --> 01:24:44.500
<v Speaker 1>trainee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know it's a tranny,</v>

2112
01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:47.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who these guys are like in,</v>

2113
01:24:47.281 --> 01:24:50.440
<v Speaker 1>in your imagination who you think don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know a man when they see one.</v>

2114
01:24:50.530 --> 01:24:52.480
<v Speaker 1>But most people know a man when they see</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

2115
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:54.540
<v Speaker 1>even if it's at hormones and it's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

2116
01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:57.260
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some close ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some ones.</v>

2117
01:24:57.790 --> 01:25:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I've seen someone that you've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bailey J no belly.</v>

2118
01:25:00.821 --> 01:25:01.654
<v Speaker 1>J transgender woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She is the most compelling argument for </v>

2119
01:25:04.691 --> 01:25:07.030
<v Speaker 1>someone who was born in the wrong sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2120
01:25:07.031 --> 01:25:10.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't think hotness is a compelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument for medical,</v>

2121
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:13.630
<v Speaker 1>like 100% 100% well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of men are pretty,</v>

2122
01:25:13.631 --> 01:25:14.860
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got a big Dick.</v>

2123
01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:17.610
<v Speaker 1>There's better pictures of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2124
01:25:18.110 --> 01:25:19.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That right there.</v>

2125
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:20.583
<v Speaker 1>Kapow come on son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not into a big fat dick to post it on </v>

2126
01:25:23.681 --> 01:25:24.514
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the weird things about </v>

2127
01:25:25.151 --> 01:25:27.040
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can be flipping through twitter</v>

2128
01:25:27.041 --> 01:25:28.600
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden you just see a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>

2129
01:25:28.601 --> 01:25:28.991
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2130
01:25:28.991 --> 01:25:29.824
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I follow a couple of porn stars </v>

2131
01:25:30.851 --> 01:25:32.020
<v Speaker 1>because I'm friends with them.</v>

2132
01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:33.153
<v Speaker 1>But if it was a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they use the twitter accounts </v>

2133
01:25:34.991 --> 01:25:36.700
<v Speaker 1>just to promote their work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sort of like,</v>

2134
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I've got like one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2135
01:25:37.961 --> 01:25:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I've got like Felix Salmon from fusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody from the Wall Street Journal,</v>

2136
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:46.360
<v Speaker 1>a colleague tweeting about Elon Musk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tranny porn.</v>

2137
01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:48.460
<v Speaker 1>It was all the time after time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2138
01:25:48.461 --> 01:25:49.530
<v Speaker 1>what was I saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2139
01:25:49.630 --> 01:25:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody believes no one,</v>

2140
01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:53.583
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a single soul believes that this </v>

2141
01:25:56.111 --> 01:25:57.730
<v Speaker 1>person is a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2142
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Might look like a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be hot my,</v>

2143
01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:00.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the rest of it.</v>

2144
01:26:00.401 --> 01:26:01.234
<v Speaker 1>But nobody believes it is a woman where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to say we have to use pronouns </v>

2145
01:26:04.041 --> 01:26:08.210
<v Speaker 1>that suggested we have to warp reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and you know,</v>

2146
01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:09.073
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and passports or the infrastructure of </v>

2147
01:26:10.501 --> 01:26:11.334
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the country has to be remodeled </v>

2148
01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:13.933
<v Speaker 1>around people with mental disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if we did this for any other </v>

2149
01:26:16.490 --> 01:26:17.323
<v Speaker 1>kind of mental disorder.</v>

2150
01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:18.313
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the left has made this as they </v>

2151
01:26:20.001 --> 01:26:22.010
<v Speaker 1>put on the front cover of Time magazine </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Laverne Cox,</v>

2152
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:24.260
<v Speaker 1>the new civil rights frontier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While,</v>

2153
01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

2154
01:26:25.251 --> 01:26:26.084
<v Speaker 1>That was the new civil rights frontier </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the cover of Time magazine with </v>

2155
01:26:28.941 --> 01:26:29.774
<v Speaker 1>Laverne Cox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hot black one and the new civil </v>

2156
01:26:31.581 --> 01:26:32.414
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laverne Cox is the one in orange is the </v>

2157
01:26:33.501 --> 01:26:35.250
<v Speaker 1>new black black training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2158
01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:36.940
<v Speaker 1>front cover time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it.</v>

2159
01:26:36.941 --> 01:26:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Then you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm sorry.</v>

2160
01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:38.811
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

2161
01:26:38.811 --> 01:26:39.644
<v Speaker 1>Civil Rights is about black people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop trying to take it is not about </v>

2162
01:26:41.601 --> 01:26:42.434
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about gays and it's not about </v>

2163
01:26:43.221 --> 01:26:45.320
<v Speaker 1>fucking trannies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Civil rights about black people.</v>

2164
01:26:45.321 --> 01:26:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Stop doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lab,</v>

2165
01:26:46.461 --> 01:26:48.890
<v Speaker 1>what the left does is it tries to </v>
<v Speaker 1>present these issues.</v>

2166
01:26:48.891 --> 01:26:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Totally unrelated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little pet projects.</v>

2167
01:26:51.321 --> 01:26:53.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a little flexing of muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say.</v>

2168
01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:55.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like the left is at home being </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2169
01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.910
<v Speaker 1>let's see what crazy thing we can make </v>
<v Speaker 1>people say they believe in today.</v>

2170
01:26:58.910 --> 01:27:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Just because we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2171
01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:01.820
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

2172
01:27:01.821 --> 01:27:03.770
<v Speaker 1>this is I'm convinced we all get </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

2173
01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.750
<v Speaker 1>You know that there must be some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like left wing build a burger.</v>

2174
01:27:05.751 --> 01:27:06.584
<v Speaker 1>It happens like in Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens like in Toronto or something </v>

2175
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:10.910
<v Speaker 1>and they're all together and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2176
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:14.270
<v Speaker 1>what is the craziest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most insane,</v>

2177
01:27:14.271 --> 01:27:16.400
<v Speaker 1>most counter intuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most like medically impossible,</v>

2178
01:27:16.401 --> 01:27:17.234
<v Speaker 1>most ridiculous thing we can come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and make everyone believe it and </v>

2179
01:27:19.131 --> 01:27:20.420
<v Speaker 1>say they believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if they don't,</v>

2180
01:27:20.421 --> 01:27:21.890
<v Speaker 1>they'll lose their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2181
01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Trannys perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2182
01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.920
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course you've got the,</v>

2183
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

2184
01:27:25.881 --> 01:27:27.530
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what they've done.</v>

2185
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Nobody believes this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to say it.</v>

2186
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:31.820
<v Speaker 1>It's so wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so wrong.</v>

2187
01:27:31.821 --> 01:27:34.160
<v Speaker 1>And when you realize what their real </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations aren't,</v>

2188
01:27:34.161 --> 01:27:34.994
<v Speaker 1>you understand why they don't care about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the science and why they're not </v>

2189
01:27:37.101 --> 01:27:38.750
<v Speaker 1>interested in exploring what we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

2190
01:27:38.751 --> 01:27:39.980
<v Speaker 1>that the treat different treatment </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathways,</v>

2191
01:27:39.981 --> 01:27:43.130
<v Speaker 1>they don't care about motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's political,</v>

2192
01:27:43.131 --> 01:27:43.970
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely political.</v>

2193
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.751
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2194
01:27:44.751 --> 01:27:45.584
<v Speaker 1>the left wants to tear down everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to just deconstruct the </v>

2195
01:27:48.051 --> 01:27:48.884
<v Speaker 1>differences between men and women </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're there because they </v>

2196
01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:52.670
<v Speaker 1>cannot cope with the fact that women </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't as good at some things as men.</v>

2197
01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:53.533
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2198
01:27:53.690 --> 01:27:55.460
<v Speaker 1>men aren't as good at some things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

2199
01:27:55.461 --> 01:27:57.980
<v Speaker 1>but you don't talk about that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't suit your narrative because</v>

2200
01:27:57.981 --> 01:27:59.420
<v Speaker 1>you want to paint women as victims all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

2201
01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:01.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to pull apart the,</v>

2202
01:28:01.261 --> 01:28:01.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2203
01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:02.290
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2204
01:28:02.290 --> 01:28:03.123
<v Speaker 1>they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to pull apart and destroy </v>

2205
01:28:03.951 --> 01:28:04.611
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2206
01:28:04.611 --> 01:28:05.470
<v Speaker 1>isn't it bizarre to</v>

2207
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:06.383
<v Speaker 6>that in this time and age of gender </v>
<v Speaker 6>neutral pronouns and these strange new </v>

2208
01:28:09.341 --> 01:28:13.390
<v Speaker 6>pronouns that they want to stick to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>traditional male female pronouns when it</v>

2209
01:28:13.391 --> 01:28:14.224
<v Speaker 6>comes to transgender people?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course they did without any </v>

2210
01:28:16.331 --> 01:28:19.270
<v Speaker 6>variation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's a she of course.</v>

2211
01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:19.871
<v Speaker 6>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

2212
01:28:19.871 --> 01:28:22.030
<v Speaker 6>this gives you an insight into what's </v>
<v Speaker 6>really happening.</v>

2213
01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.500
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it tells its own story,</v>

2214
01:28:23.530 --> 01:28:25.360
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't really believe it.</v>

2215
01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:26.861
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's that,</v>

2216
01:28:26.861 --> 01:28:30.400
<v Speaker 6>that is one of the best examples of it </v>
<v Speaker 6>because they don't really buy it.</v>

2217
01:28:30.401 --> 01:28:31.234
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is like what this Justin Trudeau </v>

2218
01:28:32.141 --> 01:28:32.974
<v Speaker 6>situation where they're trying to have </v>
<v Speaker 6>gender neutral options and your </v>

2219
01:28:35.231 --> 01:28:36.064
<v Speaker 6>identification and the thing in New York</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's going on where shopkeepers and </v>

2220
01:28:40.730 --> 01:28:41.563
<v Speaker 6>employers can be sued by for up to a </v>
<v Speaker 6>quarter million dollars from this </v>

2221
01:28:45.330 --> 01:28:49.960
<v Speaker 6>changing use the right bathroom or,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or use yes.</v>

2222
01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:55.690
<v Speaker 6>Including artificial invented pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like Zi Aa,</v>

2223
01:28:55.691 --> 01:28:58.760
<v Speaker 6>a quarter of $1 million.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean you're here her,</v>

2224
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:59.500
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here.</v>

2225
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.700
<v Speaker 6>Zaire.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know I'm good at grandma lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2228
01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm my mother's German and so I'm good </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all the different data of genitive,</v>

2229
01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:08.190
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>

2230
01:29:08.190 --> 01:29:11.460
<v Speaker 1>There are 18 new I call key gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns.</v>

2231
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:12.383
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean one can I'm I'm like Donna total </v>

2232
01:29:14.761 --> 01:29:15.630
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2233
01:29:15.631 --> 01:29:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you know like I did linguistics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like where are they coming from?</v>

2234
01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember.</v>

2235
01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:26.680
<v Speaker 3>I used to know about x themself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this one.</v>

2236
01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:32.070
<v Speaker 3>See Em self don't know xm self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that Zim self?</v>

2237
01:29:33.230 --> 01:29:35.530

<v Speaker 3>Y,</v>

2238
01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:38.700
<v Speaker 3>Z.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gee,</v>

2239
01:29:38.770 --> 01:29:39.710
<v Speaker 1>this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

2240
01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced the left wants to make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world as ugly as possible.</v>

2241
01:29:42.670 --> 01:29:44.500
<v Speaker 1>They want everyone else to be as ugly as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

2242
01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:46.990
<v Speaker 1>These pronouns are the ugliest words </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen.</v>

2243
01:29:47.650 --> 01:29:48.483
<v Speaker 1>There are beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're beautiful words and there are </v>

2244
01:29:49.741 --> 01:29:52.570
<v Speaker 1>ugly words and these are ugly words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at what feminists are doing.</v>

2245
01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:55.630
<v Speaker 1>They know that I had a podcast about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this with a great guy,</v>

2246
01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Alex Kazemi and he is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really clever,</v>

2247
01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:01.030
<v Speaker 1>brilliant writer from Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this guy.</v>

2248
01:30:01.031 --> 01:30:02.950
<v Speaker 1>He's friends with a lot of people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood that you would,</v>

2249
01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:05.620
<v Speaker 1>you would know in like very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart,</v>

2250
01:30:05.621 --> 01:30:06.151
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2251
01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:08.530
<v Speaker 1>and he was talking about my show two </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago,</v>

2252
01:30:08.710 --> 01:30:09.543
<v Speaker 1>last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks ago.</v>

2253
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:10.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2254
01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.370
<v Speaker 1>recently and it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Episode 14,</v>

2255
01:30:12.371 --> 01:30:13.150
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2256
01:30:13.150 --> 01:30:16.900
<v Speaker 1>about how beauty has become marginalized</v>
<v Speaker 1>in mainstream culture.</v>

2257
01:30:16.930 --> 01:30:18.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because feminism has told what,</v>

2258
01:30:18.301 --> 01:30:19.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body positivity stuff,</v>

2259
01:30:19.691 --> 01:30:21.670
<v Speaker 1>encouraging women to get fat and get ill</v>
<v Speaker 1>and die,</v>

2260
01:30:22.210 --> 01:30:24.910
<v Speaker 1>which is just the worst kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sociopathy and selfishness and,</v>

2261
01:30:24.911 --> 01:30:27.580
<v Speaker 1>and just just outright lies that we tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

2262
01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced the left foot because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>populated,</v>

2263
01:30:30.551 --> 01:30:33.280
<v Speaker 1>and this is all the studies say this by </v>
<v Speaker 1>just proportionately ugly people.</v>

2264
01:30:33.281 --> 01:30:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do the,</v>

2265
01:30:34.570 --> 01:30:35.403
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2266
01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:38.770
<v Speaker 1>the politicians thing where you take out</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrat and Republican,</v>

2267
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:39.833
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like politicians and you ask people to </v>

2268
01:30:40.961 --> 01:30:43.540
<v Speaker 1>rank them in hotness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost exactly 50,</v>

2269
01:30:43.541 --> 01:30:44.374
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2270
01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:45.580
<v Speaker 1>and there are studies on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd left,</v>

2271
01:30:45.581 --> 01:30:46.414
<v Speaker 1>doesn't even disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even didn't bother denying </v>

2272
01:30:47.501 --> 01:30:49.270
<v Speaker 1>this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Republicans are just way hotter.</v>

2273
01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Calkins are harder than Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every study,</v>

2274
01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.520
<v Speaker 1>every survey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans,</v>

2275
01:30:54.521 --> 01:30:55.354
<v Speaker 1>absolutely all those lovely skinny </v>
<v Speaker 1>blonde bitches with Fox News ones for </v>

2276
01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:01.360
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be a lot of hot,</v>

2277
01:31:01.361 --> 01:31:06.010
<v Speaker 1>so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really like a row Vicky Yoga teachers?</v>

2278
01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:06.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2279
01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:07.151
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new left,</v>

2280
01:31:07.151 --> 01:31:10.090
<v Speaker 1>the new social justice left the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fat,</v>

2281
01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:11.500
<v Speaker 1>ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quivering.</v>

2282
01:31:11.501 --> 01:31:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Lena Dunham left those piercing blue </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair stuff.</v>

2283
01:31:15.011 --> 01:31:15.844
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the people running culture </v>

2284
01:31:16.331 --> 01:31:19.390
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a nice here and they are trying</v>

2285
01:31:19.391 --> 01:31:21.100
<v Speaker 1>to make everybody else's ugly as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

2286
01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:25.750
<v Speaker 1>But there's a bizarre trend to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to him embrace having an obese body.</v>

2287
01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:29.030
<v Speaker 1>It's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wrote about is that like what,</v>

2288
01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:32.650
<v Speaker 1>where is that empowering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it empowering to be unhealthy,</v>

2289
01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:35.320
<v Speaker 1>listless out of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't,</v>

2290
01:31:35.321 --> 01:31:37.330
<v Speaker 1>but what they're trying to tell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immune system,</v>

2291
01:31:37.331 --> 01:31:39.070
<v Speaker 1>how is that empowering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2292
01:31:39.190 --> 01:31:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>

01:32:03.970 --> 01:32:06.770
<v Speaker 1>they have their own gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a lot of mass ham.</v>

01:32:06.771 --> 01:32:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Feast is Nastier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ham planets this or him beast.</v>

2306
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.350
<v Speaker 1>This is a bit lighter touch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2307
01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:12.550
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2308
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:14.230
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2309
01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:15.213
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable and unhappy with their own </v>

2310
01:32:16.361 --> 01:32:17.194
<v Speaker 1>lives trying to persuade the rest of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is not just neutral but a </v>

2311
01:32:20.681 --> 01:32:21.514
<v Speaker 1>positive and happy and joyous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost something to be admired and </v>

2312
01:32:24.450 --> 01:32:25.283
<v Speaker 1>always something to be imitated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being so unhealthy that your chances of </v>

2313
01:32:28.301 --> 01:32:29.770
<v Speaker 1>diabetes go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the rest of it,</v>

2314
01:32:29.771 --> 01:32:32.680
<v Speaker 1>your chances of disgusting being </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting got 4000%.</v>

2315
01:32:33.070 --> 01:32:33.903
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2316
01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

2317
01:32:36.251 --> 01:32:40.030
<v Speaker 1>very strange to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird and it's part of this,</v>

2318
01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:43.070
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the left's campaign to to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make um,</v>

2319
01:32:43.210 --> 01:32:44.590
<v Speaker 1>ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2320
01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:45.433
<v Speaker 1>like there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rush limbaugh used to say this and I </v>

2321
01:32:47.411 --> 01:32:48.244
<v Speaker 1>think he was right about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feminism is how ugly women get </v>

2322
01:32:49.841 --> 01:32:50.240
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

2323
01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:51.073
<v Speaker 1>How it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a way for ugly women to get </v>

2324
01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:55.270
<v Speaker 1>purchase in the public sphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2325
01:32:55.271 --> 01:32:57.360
<v Speaker 1>This is how ugly women get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2326
01:32:57.850 --> 01:33:00.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positions and he's right about that.</v>

2327
01:33:01.150 --> 01:33:03.070
<v Speaker 1>And this sort of social justice left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2328
01:33:03.071 --> 01:33:08.071
<v Speaker 1>the gender queer fat blue head facial </v>
<v Speaker 1>piercing thing is so horrifying and it's</v>

2329
01:33:08.441 --> 01:33:11.830
<v Speaker 1>just a way for ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marginalized outcasts to make themselves</v>

2330
01:33:11.831 --> 01:33:12.664
<v Speaker 1>feel like they're hot people and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to drag everyone else down because </v>

2331
01:33:15.370 --> 01:33:17.230
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of self harm.</v>

2332
01:33:17.530 --> 01:33:21.400
<v Speaker 1>It is extended adolescence writ large.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what my guests said,</v>

2333
01:33:21.401 --> 01:33:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he was very smart and insightful,</v>

2334
01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:24.311
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2335
01:33:24.311 --> 01:33:25.540
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

2336
01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.640
<v Speaker 1>how did we normalize Septum piercings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did,</v>

2337
01:33:30.641 --> 01:33:31.474
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lose fantasy and aspiration in </v>

2338
01:33:33.791 --> 01:33:35.560
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need those things.</v>

2339
01:33:35.690 --> 01:33:38.620
<v Speaker 1>We need people to look up to and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspire to and to admire.</v>

2340
01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:42.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's so horrifying that now the hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are feel marginalized.</v>

2341
01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:43.173
<v Speaker 1>Look at the cover of men's health and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much uglier than men on the covers </v>

2342
01:33:45.461 --> 01:33:46.294
<v Speaker 1>of men's health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men's health or getting right because </v>

2343
01:33:47.231 --> 01:33:49.210
<v Speaker 1>they weren't really relatable models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:51.400
<v Speaker 1>The bodies or about the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look at the faces,</v>

2345
01:33:51.610 --> 01:33:52.443
<v Speaker 1>look at how their shot now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're like friendly and </v>

2346
01:33:54.011 --> 01:33:55.690
<v Speaker 1>approachable and not too hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2347
01:33:55.710 --> 01:33:56.543
<v Speaker 1>used to be fucking stunning people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cover of men's health like five </v>

2348
01:33:58.541 --> 01:34:00.400
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting uglier.</v>

2349
01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:03.940
<v Speaker 1>And you can see it even in magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men's magazines.</v>

2350
01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a trend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2351
01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the acts commercial,</v>

2352
01:34:06.881 --> 01:34:09.010
<v Speaker 1>the axe commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cheap deodorant,</v>

2353
01:34:09.011 --> 01:34:10.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2354
01:34:10.290 --> 01:34:11.290
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2355
01:34:11.291 --> 01:34:13.180
<v Speaker 1>they've got a new ad out you can find on</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

2356
01:34:13.181 --> 01:34:13.811
<v Speaker 1>which is about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2357
01:34:13.811 --> 01:34:15.220
<v Speaker 1>nevermind the six pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2358
01:34:15.221 --> 01:34:16.660
<v Speaker 1>you've got the nose or whatever and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

2359
01:34:16.690 --> 01:34:18.640
<v Speaker 1>ugly guy with a huge nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind.</v>

2360
01:34:18.641 --> 01:34:19.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biceps,</v>

2361
01:34:19.691 --> 01:34:20.680
<v Speaker 1>you've got your bike.</v>

2362
01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Or some shit like that encouraging men </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2363
01:34:23.191 --> 01:34:26.470
<v Speaker 1>to be ugly and Dorky and unattractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nerdy and horrific.</v>

2364
01:34:26.471 --> 01:34:27.304
<v Speaker 1>Justin the same way that feminist had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been doing this to women for decades </v>

2365
01:34:28.871 --> 01:34:29.704
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't that just a manipulative ad </v>

2366
01:34:31.121 --> 01:34:31.954
<v Speaker 1>campaign to try to find marginalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and capitalize on dragging them </v>

2367
01:34:35.591 --> 01:34:38.470
<v Speaker 1>into your group and selling them some </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty fucking deodorant.</v>

2368
01:34:38.710 --> 01:34:42.750
<v Speaker 1>It's trying to legitimize and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately to um,</v>

2369
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:45.780
<v Speaker 1>celebrate irresponsible lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>

2370
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:48.250
<v Speaker 1>You talking about this as if some grand </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy,</v>

2371
01:34:48.251 --> 01:34:49.084
<v Speaker 1>like there's a cabal of fucking lefties </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there with the evil plan to build a </v>

2372
01:34:52.230 --> 01:34:53.930
<v Speaker 1>book in Toronto?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2373
01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:55.420
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens.</v>

2374
01:34:55.630 --> 01:34:58.780
<v Speaker 1>How else can we explain this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely happened.</v>

2375
01:34:59.050 --> 01:35:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Just a lot of marginalized people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and they find comfort in groups.</v>

2376
01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:03.793
<v Speaker 1>People always find comfort in numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when they find someone that they </v>

2377
01:35:05.961 --> 01:35:06.794
<v Speaker 1>think is beautiful and privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to lash out at them because </v>

2378
01:35:09.591 --> 01:35:12.290
<v Speaker 1>they've been jealous of that person for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time.</v>

2379
01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:13.153
<v Speaker 1>I just think as a whole person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling very personally victimized </v>

2380
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:16.183
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2381
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:18.290
<v Speaker 1>the messages that society is sending me </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

2382
01:35:18.291 --> 01:35:19.730
<v Speaker 1>And I think I might go home and caught </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

2383
01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:20.660
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2384
01:35:20.661 --> 01:35:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Well don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2385
01:35:21.621 --> 01:35:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I want to just think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2386
01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:26.390
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying and I see these</v>
<v Speaker 1>trends,</v>

2387
01:35:26.391 --> 01:35:27.224
<v Speaker 1>but I think that you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly small numbers of people that </v>

2388
01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:33.800
<v Speaker 1>are very vocal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wheel disproportionate influence.</v>

2389
01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:36.530
<v Speaker 1>They have the power and they campus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2390
01:35:36.531 --> 01:35:36.891
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2391
01:35:36.891 --> 01:35:37.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2392
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:38.383
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody I talked to is like so dumb </v>

2393
01:35:39.591 --> 01:35:40.424
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2394
01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:42.380
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get things done.</v>

2395
01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.600
<v Speaker 1>They make companies apologize for </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2396
01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.580
<v Speaker 1>They change policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2397
01:35:46.581 --> 01:35:48.250
<v Speaker 1>the feminist about video and video games</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

2398
01:35:48.251 --> 01:35:49.084
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to take your video games </v>

2399
01:35:49.431 --> 01:35:50.264
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then suddenly grand theft auto </v>

2400
01:35:50.961 --> 01:35:52.820
<v Speaker 1>disappears off the shelves of target in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

2401
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:55.940
<v Speaker 1>They get things done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are not harmless.</v>

2402
01:35:55.941 --> 01:35:56.774
<v Speaker 1>These people run culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people have the power to affect </v>

2403
01:35:59.811 --> 01:36:03.210
<v Speaker 1>what the decision making of massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>multinet considerations.</v>

2404
01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:04.453
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're loud because they're </v>

2405
01:36:05.481 --> 01:36:08.570
<v Speaker 1>organized and they have just enough not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not smart that you know,</v>

2406
01:36:08.571 --> 01:36:09.404
<v Speaker 1>that are kind of like dangerous smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just like a little bit clever and </v>

2407
01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:13.190
<v Speaker 1>with a little bit of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2408
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:16.070
<v Speaker 1>bare bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophomore at college education in gender</v>

2409
01:36:16.071 --> 01:36:16.904
<v Speaker 1>theory or the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sound smart enough that they can </v>

2410
01:36:19.671 --> 01:36:20.504
<v Speaker 1>give this veneer of thoughtfulness about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is just hateful and </v>

2411
01:36:23.871 --> 01:36:25.040
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2412
01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:25.973
<v Speaker 1>and it's so weird to me that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed the worst people in society to </v>

2413
01:36:30.471 --> 01:36:31.304
<v Speaker 1>run the rest of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are allowing the people who hate men </v>

2414
01:36:33.831 --> 01:36:36.060
<v Speaker 1>to tell girls how they should be women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>

2415
01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:38.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that race baiters and black supremacists</v>

2416
01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:41.120
<v Speaker 1>to explain to us how we should treat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2417
01:36:41.121 --> 01:36:42.580
<v Speaker 1>how we should negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2418
01:36:42.690 --> 01:36:43.820
<v Speaker 1>complex racial issues.</v>

2419
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.570
<v Speaker 1>We are allowing hideous fat monsters to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell girls no,</v>

2420
01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:51.650
<v Speaker 1>these people look like something recife </v>
<v Speaker 1>thy Murphy.</v>

2421
01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:53.690
<v Speaker 1>They look like they're from a Scifi </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

2422
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Put them next to Jabba the hut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like close your eyes and open them and</v>

2423
01:36:56.751 --> 01:36:58.100
<v Speaker 1>it takes you a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2424
01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:02.090
<v Speaker 1>like these people would be unknown to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the America in the 1950s.</v>

2425
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:04.900
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the pictures of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>women in the 1950s and you know,</v>

2426
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.940
<v Speaker 1>you know how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how elegant and it's felt and beautiful.</v>

2427
01:37:07.941 --> 01:37:11.330
<v Speaker 1>They looked and you look now and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff hurts women than most.</v>

2428
01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:15.410
<v Speaker 1>It hurts women horribly because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>women who are suffering from the obesity</v>

2429
01:37:15.411 --> 01:37:16.244
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 60% of American women who are now </v>

2430
01:37:17.781 --> 01:37:18.614
<v Speaker 1>seriously overweight and more women are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting obese at greater rates than the </v>

2431
01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:21.621
<v Speaker 1>men are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2432
01:37:21.621 --> 01:37:23.390
<v Speaker 1>The women are getting fatter faster than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the men.</v>

2433
01:37:23.391 --> 01:37:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Or did you read the new study that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just released?</v>

2434
01:37:25.810 --> 01:37:26.643
<v Speaker 1>The women of today in 2016 are as heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>as men from 1960 [inaudible] the first </v>

2435
01:37:31.911 --> 01:37:33.290
<v Speaker 1>time ever that's ever happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2436
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:35.570
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is that w um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number,</v>

2437
01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:39.890
<v Speaker 1>the number of women and the rate of </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase is skyrocketing for girls.</v>

2438
01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:40.813
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because these ham beasts are telling </v>

2439
01:37:42.951 --> 01:37:43.784
<v Speaker 1>them that being fat is fine and that fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can see where Howard people can </v>

2440
01:37:46.581 --> 01:37:47.710
<v Speaker 1>do anything thin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can do it.</v>

2441
01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:49.500
<v Speaker 1>We'll shut the fucking fridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then if you,</v>

2442
01:37:49.501 --> 01:37:51.290
<v Speaker 1>if you could do everything that thin </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can do,</v>

2443
01:37:51.291 --> 01:37:52.990
<v Speaker 1>close the fridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the downward,</v>

2444
01:37:53.110 --> 01:37:54.770
<v Speaker 1>the ice cream scoop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

2445
01:37:54.771 --> 01:37:59.771
<v Speaker 1>The average American woman weighs 166 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

2446
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:02.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a lot.</v>

2447
01:38:02.250 --> 01:38:03.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

2448
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:05.880
<v Speaker 1>that's obese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a law for a woman.</v>

2449
01:38:05.881 --> 01:38:06.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2450
01:38:06.930 --> 01:38:07.763
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the same weight as the average </v>

2451
01:38:11.071 --> 01:38:14.220
<v Speaker 1>American male from the 1960s and look </v>
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

2452
01:38:14.221 --> 01:38:15.450
<v Speaker 1>and not completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2453
01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:16.710
<v Speaker 1>men and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2454
01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immune from this effect.</v>

2455
01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:21.960
<v Speaker 1>We're all getting fatter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but women are getting a lot faster,</v>

2456
01:38:21.961 --> 01:38:24.630
<v Speaker 1>a lot faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a disturbing a number.</v>

2457
01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:25.493
<v Speaker 1>Like for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that to be the average weight of a </v>

2458
01:38:27.181 --> 01:38:28.740
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's obesity.</v>

2459
01:38:28.890 --> 01:38:30.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's also diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2460
01:38:30.421 --> 01:38:33.240
<v Speaker 1>that's not like lifting weights on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are done.</v>

2461
01:38:33.250 --> 01:38:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Crossfit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go in,</v>

2462
01:38:34.611 --> 01:38:37.710
<v Speaker 1>squats says you don't need to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise to lose weight.</v>

2463
01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:38.573
<v Speaker 1>It will be better if you did because </v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole body gets stronger and </v>

2464
01:38:40.291 --> 01:38:41.790
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're the expert in this.</v>

2465
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:43.650
<v Speaker 1>But all you need to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to lose 200 pounds,</v>

2466
01:38:43.651 --> 01:38:45.360
<v Speaker 1>just stop fucking eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2467
01:38:45.630 --> 01:38:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I got in trouble on twitter that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't have seen this,</v>

2468
01:38:47.281 --> 01:38:50.310
<v Speaker 1>but I got in huge trouble and treated </v>
<v Speaker 1>for fat shaming someone at the gym.</v>

2469
01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

2470
01:38:51.601 --> 01:38:53.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is disgusting.</v>

2471
01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have to look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2472
01:38:55.290 --> 01:38:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Well this is how first and then they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the gym.</v>

2473
01:38:57.870 --> 01:39:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Fat Shaming works right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was doing this person a favor.</v>

2474
01:39:00.931 --> 01:39:03.840
<v Speaker 1>I was doing this person a favor because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2475
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:05.370
<v Speaker 1>I wrote an article about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>

2476
01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I wrote an article about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the studies say as long as you wrote</v>

2477
01:39:07.921 --> 01:39:09.030
<v Speaker 1>an article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be true.</v>

2478
01:39:09.930 --> 01:39:10.950
<v Speaker 1>You're getting snippy again.</v>

2479
01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:14.340
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

2480
01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:15.343
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my peace drew attention to the real </v>

2481
01:39:17.371 --> 01:39:18.630
<v Speaker 1>point of my comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which studied this.</v>

2482
01:39:18.631 --> 01:39:19.464
<v Speaker 1>The studies show fat shaming works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But did you point out an individual </v>

2483
01:39:22.411 --> 01:39:25.920
<v Speaker 1>person and highlight them and did you </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify them?</v>

2484
01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:27.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did it from behind.</v>

2485
01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it didn't show their face?</v>

2486
01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:29.753
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2487
01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:31.050
<v Speaker 1>It's perfectly fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2488
01:39:31.051 --> 01:39:31.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2489
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:35.430
<v Speaker 1>this is how people get thin worrying if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be them next,</v>

2490
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:36.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could somebody tell us,</v>

2491
01:39:36.871 --> 01:39:38.370
<v Speaker 1>are you using argument for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2492
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.620
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I encourage you to go read the piece.</v>

2493
01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So I'll check it out.</v>

2495
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2496
01:39:44.610 --> 01:39:45.780
<v Speaker 1>if you're listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

2497
01:39:45.781 --> 01:39:46.614
<v Speaker 1>if you go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you've got a bright bottle </v>

2498
01:39:47.461 --> 01:39:48.660
<v Speaker 1>comm slash minor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of stuff,</v>

2499
01:39:48.661 --> 01:39:50.070
<v Speaker 1>buying about me so it will be there </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

2500
01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

2501
01:39:51.650 --> 01:39:52.471
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find it.</v>

2502
01:39:52.471 --> 01:39:54.460
<v Speaker 1>And I wrote two things at JC penny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2503
01:39:55.230 --> 01:39:57.180
<v Speaker 1>well I wrote a thing about the JC penny </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2504
01:39:57.181 --> 01:39:58.650
<v Speaker 1>seeing this fat shaming thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was disgusting.</v>

2505
01:39:58.830 --> 01:40:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's very hurtful comment </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath it.</v>

2506
01:40:00.481 --> 01:40:01.314
<v Speaker 1>They sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is 1600 words of tenuously </v>

2507
01:40:03.511 --> 01:40:05.370
<v Speaker 1>connected fat jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I didn't know better,</v>

2508
01:40:05.371 --> 01:40:06.204
<v Speaker 1>I would have got the impression that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were claiming the moral high ground </v>

2509
01:40:08.461 --> 01:40:10.560
<v Speaker 1>merely as an excuse to call people hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>planets.</v>

2510
01:40:11.610 --> 01:40:15.120
<v Speaker 1>I was very hurt by that criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's accurate and excellent.</v>

2511
01:40:15.690 --> 01:40:17.910
<v Speaker 1>That's a good to be a criticism and is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

2512
01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:23.270
<v Speaker 1>What I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I explained in my followup piece,</v>

2513
01:40:23.271 --> 01:40:24.330
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do some good.</v>

2514
01:40:24.331 --> 01:40:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Call someone fat today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

2515
01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe these bullshit studies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that come out.</v>

2516
01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:29.943
<v Speaker 1>There's the only serious study that says</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fat shaming doesn't work is from </v>

2517
01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.890
<v Speaker 1>University College London and it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopelessly flawed.</v>

2518
01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:37.770
<v Speaker 1>It deals with a tiny group of like 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>year olds and upwards.</v>

2519
01:40:37.771 --> 01:40:38.604
<v Speaker 1>And that's not what this is directed is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not what the messaging is directed to </v>

2520
01:40:40.981 --> 01:40:41.814
<v Speaker 1>because they're using young 25 to 35 </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old singers and writers in these </v>

2521
01:40:45.031 --> 01:40:47.490
<v Speaker 1>commercials telling 20 year old girls </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can eat what the fuck they want.</v>

2522
01:40:47.670 --> 01:40:49.200
<v Speaker 1>This is not about 50 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2523
01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:51.480
<v Speaker 1>So don't believe this stuff because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not true.</v>

2524
01:40:51.481 --> 01:40:52.910
<v Speaker 1>You've got to dig under the surface fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2525
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Of course fat shaming works and anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got in trouble for this,</v>

2526
01:40:56.231 --> 01:40:57.064
<v Speaker 1>this tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was doing that person trouble </v>

2527
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.840
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2528
01:40:58.840 --> 01:40:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

2529
01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.173
<v Speaker 1>Negative attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you knew that that was coming </v>

2530
01:41:02.531 --> 01:41:03.580
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

2531
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Don't bother lifting anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's cardio is pointless.</v>

2557
01:41:59.321 --> 01:42:00.154
<v Speaker 1>Cardio is a masochist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To Way to lose weight is completely </v>

2558
01:42:01.841 --> 01:42:02.674
<v Speaker 1>pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do some wacky like nutrient </v>

2559
01:42:05.501 --> 01:42:07.660
<v Speaker 1>partitioner that you're entering into my</v>
<v Speaker 1>realm.</v>

2560
01:42:07.661 --> 01:42:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not true at all.</v>

2561
01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.670
<v Speaker 1>350 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is he realistic distinctly going?</v>

2562
01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:17.770
<v Speaker 1>It will elevate his metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will aid in his body burning off at,</v>

2563
01:42:17.771 --> 01:42:20.050
<v Speaker 1>the main thing that needs to do is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>calories in,</v>

2564
01:42:20.051 --> 01:42:22.300
<v Speaker 1>calories out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he'd be 350 pounds.</v>

2565
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:24.400
<v Speaker 1>The best thing you can do is just stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating.</v>

2566
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:26.930
<v Speaker 1>This is a person who is clearly taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>in seven hours,</v>

2567
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:27.783
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>ice either because it's a day stopping </v>

2568
01:42:30.311 --> 01:42:31.144
<v Speaker 1>eating actually slows your metabolism </v>
<v Speaker 1>down because your body thinks it's in </v>

2569
01:42:33.521 --> 01:42:35.200
<v Speaker 1>famine mode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right things,</v>

2570
01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:40.450
<v Speaker 1>the right to change your gut bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different factors,</v>

2571
01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:42.340
<v Speaker 1>but one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the big ones is sugar,</v>

2572
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:46.440
<v Speaker 1>sugar and simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I say stop eating fiercely,</v>

2573
01:42:46.450 --> 01:42:48.670
<v Speaker 1>that's a shorthand for don't go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's anymore.</v>

2574
01:42:48.970 --> 01:42:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Unhealthy food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

2575
01:42:50.531 --> 01:42:54.850
<v Speaker 1>What has sugar and the carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their body would miraculously shrink.</v>

2576
01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:55.713
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's because you're lazy.</v>

01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Like stop saying that.</v>

2583
01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.710
<v Speaker 1>It is some kind of like hormonal </v>
<v Speaker 1>deficiency or,</v>

2584
01:43:08.711 --> 01:43:09.544
<v Speaker 1>or some emotional disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't stop inflicting yourself on the </v>

<v Speaker 1>rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see you at the gym.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Stay home,</v>

2589
01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:22.510
<v Speaker 1>eat better food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have to run,</v>

2590
01:43:22.690 --> 01:43:24.220
<v Speaker 1>get a running machine delivered to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

2591
01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Amazon has them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start at $100.</v>

01:43:26.170 --> 01:43:28.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see you and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know these people,</v>

2594
01:43:30.220 --> 01:43:31.053
<v Speaker 1>I was on Reddit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like a huge thread on reddit lost </v>

<v Speaker 1>this monster is like fat shaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some poor,</v>

2597

<v Speaker 1>It his,</v>

2599
01:43:37.390 --> 01:43:38.223
<v Speaker 1>his actions have consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the world not least </v>

2600
01:43:39.521 --> 01:43:42.010
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have to look at you.</v>

2601
01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2602
01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:49.020
<v Speaker 1>I think that if someone being fat at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gym throws you off your workout,</v>

2603
01:43:49.090 --> 01:43:51.470
<v Speaker 1>you are not dedicated to your task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sir.</v>

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe my not my attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my salute.</v>

2605
01:43:53.631 --> 01:43:55.490
<v Speaker 1>People that are fat that are taking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance,</v>

2606
01:43:55.491 --> 01:43:57.530
<v Speaker 1>they're doing something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Making it to say,</v>

2607
01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:00.330
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're turning your life around.</v>

2608
01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Do it hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it at home.</v>

2609
01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:03.673
<v Speaker 1>Like I saw this guy at the gym doing his</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs were like hanging out of his </v>

2610
01:44:06.771 --> 01:44:09.170
<v Speaker 1>shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enormous fat guy,</v>

2611
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:12.140
<v Speaker 1>but he had the balls to go out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>

2612
01:44:12.141 --> 01:44:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Like that didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shouldn't,</v>

2613
01:44:13.671 --> 01:44:15.800
<v Speaker 1>he should stay home in Shaman stove.</v>

2614
01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:20.900
<v Speaker 1>I just agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible for the immune system.</v>

2615
01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:24.430
<v Speaker 1>The Punch cards from whatever disgusting</v>
<v Speaker 1>takeout.</v>

01:45:35.151 --> 01:45:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I was a of before I was a generalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2647
01:45:36.801 --> 01:45:39.310
<v Speaker 1>I used to build houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why I can afford,</v>

2648
01:45:39.330 --> 01:45:41.750
<v Speaker 1>can survive on a journalist salary now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>

2649
01:45:41.751 --> 01:45:43.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's it like an ordinance,</v>

2650
01:45:43.461 --> 01:45:44.294
<v Speaker 1>you know in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in England where you have to put the </v>

2651
01:45:45.351 --> 01:45:47.720
<v Speaker 1>light switch is not here where everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs them.</v>

2652
01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:49.910
<v Speaker 1>But here where the wheelchair people </v>
<v Speaker 1>need them.</v>

2653
01:45:50.150 --> 01:45:50.983
<v Speaker 1>Why I'm not selling my house to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not how to say my house to </v>

2654
01:45:53.241 --> 01:45:54.230
<v Speaker 1>somebody with no legs.</v>

2655
01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Like what the hell is going on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2656
01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:59.870
<v Speaker 1>this is the supposedly these tiny little</v>
<v Speaker 1>minorities and people who say they speak</v>

2657
01:45:59.871 --> 01:46:02.080
<v Speaker 1>for those minorities who don't because </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the people that I know,</v>

2658
01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:03.093
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know veterans who are in wheelchairs </v>

2659
01:46:04.461 --> 01:46:05.294
<v Speaker 1>who would probably laugh at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation we just had rather than </v>

2660
01:46:06.501 --> 01:46:08.570
<v Speaker 1>getting offended and then we'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2661
01:46:08.571 --> 01:46:10.040
<v Speaker 1>put the light switch is wherever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you want.</v>

2662
01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:11.053
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sort of stupid lobbies where all </v>

2663
01:46:11.871 --> 01:46:15.140
<v Speaker 1>of us has to calf to count out these </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny slices of society.</v>

2664
01:46:15.141 --> 01:46:17.410
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know you have to put these lights,</v>

2665
01:46:17.411 --> 01:46:20.060
<v Speaker 1>which is done with it inconvenient for </v>
<v Speaker 1>99.8%</v>

2666
01:46:20.061 --> 01:46:21.620
<v Speaker 1>of the rest of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>

2667
01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:22.101
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2668
01:46:22.101 --> 01:46:25.010
<v Speaker 1>these disabled people were demanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>like concrete ramps on the way up to the</v>

2669
01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:25.844
<v Speaker 1>council building so he can go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>collect their disability benefit and </v>

2670
01:46:27.741 --> 01:46:31.130
<v Speaker 1>their welfare checks twice a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get someone to help you.</v>

2671
01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:33.960
<v Speaker 1>There was somebody in the UK who filed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawsuit against a council.</v>

2672
01:46:33.961 --> 01:46:36.950
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have accessible ramps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>

2673
01:46:36.951 --> 01:46:37.784
<v Speaker 1>these people are out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

2674
01:46:40.731 --> 01:46:42.320
<v Speaker 1>with a wheelchair ramp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2675
01:46:42.630 --> 01:46:43.880
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might have got a little bit,</v>

2676
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:45.370
<v Speaker 1>you get a little look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a little carried away.</v>

2677
01:46:45.371 --> 01:46:47.470
<v Speaker 1>She stuck with the fat thing cause I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>

2678
01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean the fat thing I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sympathetic on and there is a</v>

2679
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.903
<v Speaker 2>thing there where you're making sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>were making people feel bad instead of </v>

2680
01:46:54.511 --> 01:46:56.730
<v Speaker 2>saying you're beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what you are,</v>

2681
01:46:56.850 --> 01:46:59.040
<v Speaker 2>you're not place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unhealthy.</v>

2682
01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:02.700
<v Speaker 2>And it's not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This beautiful at any size,</v>

2683
01:47:03.090 --> 01:47:04.260
<v Speaker 2>it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2684
01:47:04.261 --> 01:47:06.780
<v Speaker 2>at the Nep is young and unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unique.</v>

2685
01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:09.530
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's so special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there was,</v>

2686
01:47:09.531 --> 01:47:11.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are objective beauty standards for</v>

2687
01:47:11.311 --> 01:47:12.240
<v Speaker 2>men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2688
01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:14.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and most,</v>

2689
01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:15.563
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people who most people find </v>

2690
01:47:16.471 --> 01:47:18.540
<v Speaker 2>hot and those people tend not to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>size,</v>

2691
01:47:18.730 --> 01:47:20.320
<v Speaker 2>the size of houses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2692
01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:22.050
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or how about are never,</v>

2693
01:47:22.590 --> 01:47:24.660
<v Speaker 2>and usually when people say that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are hot,</v>

2694
01:47:24.661 --> 01:47:25.494
<v Speaker 2>they're being disingenuous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're applying these artificial </v>

2695
01:47:27.811 --> 01:47:30.460
<v Speaker 2>standards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making a fake standard bullshit.</v>

2696
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:33.990
<v Speaker 2>What do you think by the way of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I was talking to,</v>

2697
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:35.820
<v Speaker 2>he was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in culture as well.</v>

2698
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:37.230
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to somebody today about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2699
01:47:37.231 --> 01:47:39.450
<v Speaker 2>all this kind of like sexual harassment </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

2700
01:47:39.630 --> 01:47:40.463
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual harassment stuff that women do </v>

2701
01:47:43.261 --> 01:47:45.180
<v Speaker 2>now when they've been touched on the leg</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

2702
01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:47.710
<v Speaker 2>And Anna has this theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

2703
01:47:47.711 --> 01:47:49.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't drop her in it cause I can't</v>

2704
01:47:49.891 --> 01:47:51.150
<v Speaker 2>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a part of the conversation on the</v>

2705
01:47:51.151 --> 01:47:52.470
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me just say,</v>

2706
01:47:52.471 --> 01:47:55.110
<v Speaker 2>this is my theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is not ankle to theory.</v>

2707
01:47:55.111 --> 01:47:55.944
<v Speaker 2>She is not guilty because I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly remember whether she said it's </v>

2708
01:47:57.701 --> 01:47:59.160
<v Speaker 2>on all the way she said it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>

2709
01:47:59.430 --> 01:48:02.130
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sexual harassment craze right now?</v>

2710
01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:04.560
<v Speaker 2>It's really just a way for women to tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>you they've been hit on,</v>

2711
01:48:04.561 --> 01:48:05.394
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really just a way for women to </v>

2712
01:48:06.481 --> 01:48:08.790
<v Speaker 2>saving up the somebody well known,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not just that,</v>

2713
01:48:08.791 --> 01:48:11.310
<v Speaker 2>but somebody was expressing sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in me because all of these like</v>

2714
01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:14.880
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote rape stories from campuses</v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't actually involve any sex.</v>

2715
01:48:15.150 --> 01:48:15.983
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course the ones that do involve sex </v>

2716
01:48:17.491 --> 01:48:19.530
<v Speaker 2>rape stories are all for all frauds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hoaxes.</v>

2717
01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:21.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that don't,</v>

2718
01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:22.930
<v Speaker 2>the ones that involve sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sort of,</v>

2719
01:48:22.931 --> 01:48:24.450
<v Speaker 2>they're all hideous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone touched my breast.</v>

2720
01:48:24.451 --> 01:48:26.640
<v Speaker 2>How awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a woman really telling you there?</v>

2721
01:48:26.850 --> 01:48:28.610
<v Speaker 2>She's telling you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2722
01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:31.140
<v Speaker 2>someone was sexually interested in her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the sort of bragging,</v>

2723
01:48:31.141 --> 01:48:31.980
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2724
01:48:31.981 --> 01:48:35.610
<v Speaker 2>it only does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One does really touch your breasts.</v>

2725
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Are we supposed to know now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's always people,</v>

2726
01:48:38.541 --> 01:48:40.350
<v Speaker 2>some guy just comes up and grabs your </v>
<v Speaker 2>tit.</v>

2727
01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is sexual assault.</v>

2728
01:48:43.050 --> 01:48:43.883
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our parents' generation would have </v>

2729
01:48:45.451 --> 01:48:46.340
<v Speaker 2>turned around and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kia,</v>

2730
01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:49.260
<v Speaker 2>keep your fucking hands to yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>moved on with their lives.</v>

2731
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:50.183
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't have gone into university </v>
<v Speaker 2>administrators and tried to destroy the </v>

2732
01:48:52.441 --> 01:48:55.450
<v Speaker 2>guy's reputation in life over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that big a deal because I might</v>

2733
01:48:55.451 --> 01:48:57.000
<v Speaker 2>touch your to get over it.</v>

2734
01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:00.150
<v Speaker 2>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a no person that doesn't have any</v>

2735
01:49:00.151 --> 01:49:02.340
<v Speaker 2>respect to somebody else's body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's rude,</v>

2736
01:49:02.341 --> 01:49:04.800
<v Speaker 2>but when you enlarge the take those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people out of campus,</v>

2737
01:49:04.801 --> 01:49:05.634
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be allowed to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That someone's pussy that you'd be able </v>

2738
01:49:08.851 --> 01:49:11.970
<v Speaker 2>to grab girl's ass and squeezy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously there's a line,</v>

2739
01:49:11.971 --> 01:49:12.804
<v Speaker 2>but listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can fuck with someone </v>

2740
01:49:13.471 --> 01:49:14.580
<v Speaker 2>emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't do that.</v>

2741
01:49:14.590 --> 01:49:18.720
<v Speaker 2>You're making physical contact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You on inappropriate where an adult,</v>

2742
01:49:19.110 --> 01:49:19.943

<v Speaker 2>18 and 19 year old kids who are coming </v>

2743
01:49:23.821 --> 01:49:25.360
<v Speaker 2>to college and this is where you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2744

<v Speaker 2>sexuality.</v>

2745
01:49:28.991 --> 01:49:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exploring other people.</v>

2746
01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:31.463
<v Speaker 2>There are all sorts of confused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>awkward situations in those years at </v>

2747
01:49:35.311 --> 01:49:37.620
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we should not do is be going in and</v>

2748
01:49:37.621 --> 01:49:40.050
<v Speaker 2>legislating which colleges are now </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do legislative,</v>

2749
01:49:40.051 --> 01:49:40.884
<v Speaker 2>the sex lives of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovering each other and don't know </v>

2750
01:49:42.481 --> 01:49:44.310
<v Speaker 2>what the rules are yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2751
01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:45.173
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows you don't walk up to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl and grab her and they know they </v>

2752
01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:48.190
<v Speaker 2>should</v>

2753
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:51.090
<v Speaker 1>learn and the best way to learn is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a woman's at school.</v>

2754
01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:52.031
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2755
01:49:52.031 --> 01:49:53.410
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Way to learn is a woman,</v>

2756
01:49:53.411 --> 01:49:53.951
<v Speaker 1>Tony Man,</v>

2759
01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:58.990
<v Speaker 1>That's how you or your friend goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2760
01:49:58.991 --> 01:50:01.420
<v Speaker 1>that was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it on camera.</v>

2761
01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:02.303
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always going to be people like </v>

2762
01:50:02.531 --> 01:50:03.030
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

2763
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to on a mass recommendations </v>

2764
01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:07.180
<v Speaker 1>because he touched him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his reputation is shitty.</v>

2765
01:50:07.181 --> 01:50:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean grabbing strangers,</v>

2766
01:50:08.711 --> 01:50:09.220
<v Speaker 1>tit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2767
01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:11.320
<v Speaker 1>you'll see all this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a mistake.</v>

2768
01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Your natural instinct toward chivalry </v>
<v Speaker 1>and gallantry,</v>

2769
01:50:14.710 --> 01:50:19.360
<v Speaker 1>which is to your great credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I think blinding you with the reality</v>

2770
01:50:19.361 --> 01:50:20.194
<v Speaker 1>of what's happening on college campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is young boys are effectively </v>

2771
01:50:22.961 --> 01:50:26.020
<v Speaker 1>being criminalized for normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration of their sexuality.</v>

2772
01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:27.293
<v Speaker 1>There's a very specific example you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about unwanted grabbing a </v>

2773
01:50:30.131 --> 01:50:30.580
<v Speaker 1>breast.</v>

2774
01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:31.413
<v Speaker 1>I do think that there's a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to hit on people in a clumsy way </v>

2775
01:50:35.231 --> 01:50:36.064
<v Speaker 1>that gets misinterpreted or that's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue we talking about physically </v>

2776
01:50:40.661 --> 01:50:43.120
<v Speaker 1>grabbing someone's tip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really crossing the line.</v>

2777
01:50:43.121 --> 01:50:45.400
<v Speaker 1>People grabbed each other for kisses all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

2778
01:50:45.401 --> 01:50:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Like in its student nightclubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were just like,</v>

2779
01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:48.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like go in for a kiss and maybe like </v>

2780
01:50:49.691 --> 01:50:51.430
<v Speaker 1>their lips touch or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that sexual assault?</v>

2781
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Just gimme a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's is people now that's different.</v>

2782
01:50:55.660 --> 01:50:56.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about unwanted tit </v>

2783
01:50:57.041 --> 01:50:57.874
<v Speaker 1>grazers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's worse than like putting your </v>

2784
01:50:59.441 --> 01:51:00.820
<v Speaker 1>tongue down someone's throat when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want it.</v>

2785
01:51:01.090 --> 01:51:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't want it,</v>

2786
01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:05.230
<v Speaker 1>you should probably know when someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be kissed.</v>

2787
01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know if that's exactly my point,</v>

2788
01:51:07.150 --> 01:51:09.040
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at college,</v>

2789
01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:10.960
<v Speaker 1>you may have been to an all boys high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

2790
01:51:10.961 --> 01:51:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2791
01:51:11.230 --> 01:51:14.630
<v Speaker 1>You made learning come to terms with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

2792
01:51:14.670 --> 01:51:16.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the opposite sex,</v>

2793
01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:18.340
<v Speaker 1>you are discovering your own body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their body.</v>

2794
01:51:18.341 --> 01:51:20.270
<v Speaker 1>You might not even know if you're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2795
01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Or you don't know what the rules are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the rules are.</v>

2796
01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:24.333
<v Speaker 1>I know what the rules are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 year old kids do not know what the </v>

2797
01:51:26.291 --> 01:51:27.124
<v Speaker 1>rules are and to have their entire half </v>
<v Speaker 1>their reputations destroyed forever is </v>

2798
01:51:29.801 --> 01:51:32.260
<v Speaker 1>obscene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a difference between</v>

2799
01:51:32.261 --> 01:51:33.820
<v Speaker 1>when did the scenario you're describing </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

2800
01:51:33.821 --> 01:51:36.970
<v Speaker 1>which is like a nightclub scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two people are close to each other,</v>

2801
01:51:36.971 --> 01:51:41.020
<v Speaker 1>guy moves in for a kiss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a breast and goes in for a kiss.</v>

2802
01:51:41.021 --> 01:51:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean these things just happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>

2803
01:51:42.951 --> 01:51:43.810
<v Speaker 1>have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if these,</v>

2804
01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:46.300
<v Speaker 1>if these campus administrators walked </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a gay club,</v>

2805
01:51:46.301 --> 01:51:47.134
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their heads would explode with the </v>

2806
01:51:48.491 --> 01:51:51.130
<v Speaker 1>amount of like inappropriate cock </v>
<v Speaker 1>touching and all the rest of it.</v>

2807
01:51:51.130 --> 01:51:54.280
<v Speaker 1>But that's excludes dudes with dude's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no Yang.</v>

2808
01:51:54.281 --> 01:51:56.320
<v Speaker 1>It's all younger lesbians don't have sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all,</v>

2809
01:51:56.321 --> 01:51:57.160
<v Speaker 1>do they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2810
01:51:57.161 --> 01:51:59.530
<v Speaker 1>if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same.</v>

2811
01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:00.553
<v Speaker 1>If that's another weird thing I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring up about transgender people is </v>

2812
01:52:02.591 --> 01:52:05.080
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of them become lesbians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They turn into women,</v>

2813
01:52:05.081 --> 01:52:06.790
<v Speaker 1>but then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanna have sex with men.</v>

2814
01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:09.190
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of another way that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>regret comes out,</v>

2815
01:52:09.191 --> 01:52:09.881
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2816
01:52:09.881 --> 01:52:12.730
<v Speaker 1>that's a Bruce Jenner thing and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>several other ones as well.</v>

2817
01:52:12.731 --> 01:52:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Or this general lesbian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did we have to call it?</v>

2818
01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to call him a lesbian now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2819
01:52:17.021 --> 01:52:18.790
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Bruce Jenner,</v>

2820
01:52:18.791 --> 01:52:23.791
<v Speaker 1>winner of the 200 meters is not as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's weird is when you go back to that</v>

2821
01:52:24.671 --> 01:52:26.800
<v Speaker 1>era of the Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what does it say?</v>

2822
01:52:26.801 --> 01:52:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Does it say Bruce Jenner one or does it </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2823
01:52:28.571 --> 01:52:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they changed it?</v>

2824
01:52:29.801 --> 01:52:30.810
<v Speaker 1>I've looked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2825
01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:31.091
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2826
01:52:31.091 --> 01:52:33.640
<v Speaker 1>They've changed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've changed it in wikipedia.</v>

2827
01:52:34.110 --> 01:52:34.943
<v Speaker 1>In wikipedia it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says worse even than you think it's </v>

2828
01:52:37.061 --> 01:52:39.460
<v Speaker 1>as Katelyn Jana was the winner of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>men's too.</v>

2829
01:52:40.930 --> 01:52:43.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what it says now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>

2830
01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Madness.</v>

2831
01:52:47.690 --> 01:52:49.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just says,</v>

2832
01:52:49.251 --> 01:52:50.420
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so crazy.</v>

2833
01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what that is.</v>

2834
01:52:52.221 --> 01:52:53.054
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a sign of the times what </v>

2835
01:52:54.771 --> 01:52:58.100
<v Speaker 2>happened to us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did we get so bizarre and how did it</v>

2836
01:52:58.101 --> 01:53:00.310
<v Speaker 2>happen so quickly and services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2837
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:05.380
<v Speaker 2>gave up the culture wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a simplistic gas.</v>

2838
01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:05.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2839
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:08.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the sequester accelerating.</v>

2840
01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:08.953
<v Speaker 2>There's an accelerating attitude that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that somehow or another is prevalent </v>

2841
01:53:12.290 --> 01:53:14.390
<v Speaker 2>throughout college campuses throughout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>

2842
01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:15.293
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same left of the 1960s and </v>

2843
01:53:17.181 --> 01:53:22.181
<v Speaker 2>the 70s it's this new left whereas the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left is mutated slightly.</v>

2844
01:53:23.661 --> 01:53:26.240
<v Speaker 2>It's got more hardline and crazier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is the same people.</v>

2845
01:53:26.241 --> 01:53:27.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean the campus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2846
01:53:27.171 --> 01:53:28.004
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same professors who around in the </v>

2847
01:53:30.110 --> 01:53:30.943
<v Speaker 2>70s and eighties and now still work in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gender studies department and the </v>

2848
01:53:32.301 --> 01:53:37.280
<v Speaker 2>same people that have got their views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point is the right doesn't really</v>

2849
01:53:37.281 --> 01:53:40.790
<v Speaker 2>embrace much different values and rules </v>
<v Speaker 2>than they did in the 70s,</v>

2850
01:53:40.791 --> 01:53:41.360
<v Speaker 2>80s and nine.</v>

2851
01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:42.021
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>

2852
01:53:42.021 --> 01:53:42.854
<v Speaker 2>You just have no idea what they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they've completely exited the </v>

2853
01:53:44.991 --> 01:53:45.824
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The right has not bothered to engage on </v>

2854
01:53:47.610 --> 01:53:48.980
<v Speaker 2>kit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on university campuses.</v>

2855
01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:49.993
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has not put up a fight in education </v>

2856
01:53:51.411 --> 01:53:53.330
<v Speaker 2>or entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not part of fight in the,</v>

2857
01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:55.310
<v Speaker 2>in the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not put up a fight anyway.</v>

2858
01:53:55.311 --> 01:53:56.144
<v Speaker 2>It's given.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

2859
01:53:56.210 --> 01:53:57.890
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't fought and lost the culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>wars.</v>

2860
01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:58.753
<v Speaker 2>It merely handed them over to the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the right the right is full of </v>

2861
01:54:01.611 --> 01:54:02.444
<v Speaker 2>dorks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And geeks and loses and Weirdos who are </v>

2862
01:54:04.011 --> 01:54:04.844
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with money and power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all they care about is Wall Street </v>

2863
01:54:06.171 --> 01:54:07.004
<v Speaker 2>and Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they forgot is that people don't </v>

2864
01:54:09.111 --> 01:54:09.944
<v Speaker 2>vote for Wall Street and Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People vote according to their values </v>

2865
01:54:12.411 --> 01:54:14.000
<v Speaker 2>and they learn their values through </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

2866
01:54:14.001 --> 01:54:15.950
<v Speaker 2>through art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through what they watch on TV,</v>

2867
01:54:15.951 --> 01:54:16.784
<v Speaker 2>the music they listen to and the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right just handed that over to the left </v>

2868
01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:22.310
<v Speaker 2>and the left has run those things for 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2869
01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:23.353
<v Speaker 2>And that's why things are so crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the people running it had been </v>

2870
01:54:25.971 --> 01:54:28.520
<v Speaker 2>unopposed for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've user called evermore wildly,</v>

2871
01:54:28.521 --> 01:54:31.550
<v Speaker 2>wildly hysterical and crazy because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>all need healthy opposition,</v>

2872
01:54:31.570 --> 01:54:32.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't think there's been a </v>

2873
01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:34.453
<v Speaker 2>comparable sort of shift in the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the left has gotten wilder and </v>

2874
01:54:39.051 --> 01:54:42.350
<v Speaker 2>crazier with their idea is the right is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not the right or it hasn't gone crazy.</v>

2875
01:54:42.351 --> 01:54:43.800
<v Speaker 2>If anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right it's going to be terrian.</v>

2876
01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.140
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the most exciting bits of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right,</v>

2877
01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:48.920
<v Speaker 2>perhaps breitbart where I work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2878
01:54:48.921 --> 01:54:50.870
<v Speaker 2>I think a large proportion of trump's </v>
<v Speaker 2>voters,</v>

2879
01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:51.883
<v Speaker 2>and I think a lot of just conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 2>in general reacting against political </v>

2880
01:54:54.231 --> 01:54:55.064
<v Speaker 2>correctness and responding to the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>excesses of nannying pole clutching </v>

2881
01:54:59.151 --> 01:54:59.984
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the writers become a </v>

2882
01:55:01.061 --> 01:55:03.500
<v Speaker 2>libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Pearl clutching,</v>

2883
01:55:03.810 --> 01:55:05.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like fainting couch comes up,</v>

2884
01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:06.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2885
01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:09.530
<v Speaker 2>I think for many on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2886
01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:10.453
<v Speaker 2>the reaction gets political correctness </v>
<v Speaker 2>has pushed them in a libertarian </v>

2887
01:55:11.871 --> 01:55:12.704
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you want to be a libertarian </v>

2888
01:55:13.371 --> 01:55:14.204
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pretty much have to be a </v>

2889
01:55:14.511 --> 01:55:16.850
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think also,</v>

2890
01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:17.713
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing has happened on the </v>

2891
01:55:19.881 --> 01:55:24.881
<v Speaker 2>right is the death of really of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the reduced influence of religion and</v>

2892
01:55:25.791 --> 01:55:29.240
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you will probably find welcome has</v>

2893
01:55:29.241 --> 01:55:31.220
<v Speaker 2>meant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for people under 40,</v>

2894
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:33.920
<v Speaker 2>the social conservatism of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents' and grandparents' generation is</v>

2895
01:55:33.921 --> 01:55:34.754
<v Speaker 2>effectively dead and gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the most exciting young </v>

2896
01:55:36.741 --> 01:55:38.990
<v Speaker 2>conservatives don't look like all </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives.</v>

2897
01:55:38.991 --> 01:55:41.420
<v Speaker 2>They're not like rich old white man who </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2898
01:55:41.421 --> 01:55:43.050
<v Speaker 2>hate gay marriage and our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2899
01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:45.510
<v Speaker 2>sound faintly racist after a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>glasses of wine.</v>

2900
01:55:45.810 --> 01:55:47.010
<v Speaker 2>They are young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>

2901
01:55:47.011 --> 01:55:47.791
<v Speaker 2>quirky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>

2902
01:55:47.791 --> 01:55:49.080
<v Speaker 2>dissident punks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2903
01:55:49.081 --> 01:55:49.914
<v Speaker 2>who only find room to grow and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous and difficult and expand on </v>

2904
01:55:52.951 --> 01:55:53.700
<v Speaker 2>the right.</v>

2905
01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:54.533
<v Speaker 2>I think I fall into that bracket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also a lot of trump's young fans </v>

2906
01:55:56.371 --> 01:55:57.204
<v Speaker 2>fall into that bracket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who just want the freedom to say </v>

2907
01:55:58.801 --> 01:56:01.470
<v Speaker 2>do and be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nowhere for the left arm.</v>

2908
01:56:01.570 --> 01:56:03.300
<v Speaker 2>There's nowhere left on the left for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2909
01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:05.130
<v Speaker 2>That is a bizarre shift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2910
01:56:05.131 --> 01:56:06.840
<v Speaker 2>That is a very bizarre shift we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting.</v>

2911
01:56:06.841 --> 01:56:07.674
<v Speaker 2>Being accepting of that kind of behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>is much more thought of as something </v>

2912
01:56:10.870 --> 01:56:12.450
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's now a conservative thing.</v>

2913
01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:13.313
<v Speaker 2>That's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's now a conservative thing and I </v>

2914
01:56:14.551 --> 01:56:15.384
<v Speaker 2>don't think any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody can realistically </v>

2915
01:56:16.891 --> 01:56:19.200
<v Speaker 2>claim otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are a dissident,</v>

2916
01:56:19.201 --> 01:56:20.034
<v Speaker 2>a mischief maker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you believe in pushing boundaries in </v>

2917
01:56:21.661 --> 01:56:22.530
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

2918
01:56:22.531 --> 01:56:23.281
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy,</v>

2919
01:56:23.281 --> 01:56:24.120
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2920
01:56:24.121 --> 01:56:25.020
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2921
01:56:25.290 --> 01:56:28.770
<v Speaker 2>If you want to be dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be a conservative.</v>

2922
01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:30.070
<v Speaker 2>And the left did this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right,</v>

2923
01:56:30.071 --> 01:56:31.710
<v Speaker 2>it didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The right didn't win any arguments.</v>

2924
01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:32.573
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left just got overconfident and got </v>

2925
01:56:33.451 --> 01:56:35.550
<v Speaker 2>carried away and alienated the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

2926
01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:37.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could've,</v>

2927
01:56:37.110 --> 01:56:39.490
<v Speaker 2>I could've been like a center lefty if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2928
01:56:39.491 --> 01:56:41.790
<v Speaker 2>if they were more sensible on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2929
01:56:42.330 --> 01:56:44.700
<v Speaker 2>economics or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on social issues,</v>

2930
01:56:44.701 --> 01:56:45.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2931
01:56:45.841 --> 01:56:46.674
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm foul mouth and young and gay and </v>

2932
01:56:50.490 --> 01:56:52.170
<v Speaker 2>love black whatever and all the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2933
01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:56.370
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't be a conservative on paper.</v>

2934
01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I am,</v>

2935
01:56:57.451 --> 01:57:00.360
<v Speaker 2>because the left is ejected me because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got the wrong opinions about things</v>

2936
01:57:00.361 --> 01:57:01.194
<v Speaker 2>and because it won't let me talk how I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to talk because you have honest </v>

2937
01:57:02.911 --> 01:57:06.030
<v Speaker 2>opinions about feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honest opinions about social justice.</v>

2938
01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:07.020
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>

2939
01:57:07.021 --> 01:57:08.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm persona non,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gosh to the left,</v>

2940
01:57:08.190 --> 01:57:10.120
<v Speaker 2>I only got one place left to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2941
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:12.030
<v Speaker 2>and this is how the left has created,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2942
01:57:12.031 --> 01:57:14.190
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands if not millions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump voters.</v>

2943
01:57:14.190 --> 01:57:14.551
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2944
01:57:14.551 --> 01:57:15.840
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nannying and the,</v>

2945
01:57:15.841 --> 01:57:16.674
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the controlling that school mom </v>

2946
01:57:18.610 --> 01:57:19.443
<v Speaker 2>missioners you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they want to order your crayons </v>

2947
01:57:21.150 --> 01:57:24.390
<v Speaker 2>and treat us all like children has </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushed so many of us over to the right.</v>

2948
01:57:24.391 --> 01:57:25.224
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2949
01:57:25.230 --> 01:57:27.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm far right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm as right as it gets.</v>

2950
01:57:27.541 --> 01:57:28.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so,</v>

2951
01:57:28.591 --> 01:57:31.680
<v Speaker 2>so I'm so far right on economics or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of it's social.</v>

2952
01:57:31.681 --> 01:57:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Obviously a bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get more complex,</v>

2953
01:57:33.421 --> 01:57:34.980
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the borders,</v>

2954
01:57:35.010 --> 01:57:36.630
<v Speaker 2>on trade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2955
01:57:36.631 --> 01:57:37.464
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a trump guy now I might have ended </v>

2956
01:57:38.941 --> 01:57:41.250
<v Speaker 2>up very differently if I hadn't been </v>
<v Speaker 2>ejected by the left.</v>

2957
01:57:41.670 --> 01:57:45.150
<v Speaker 2>But do you have any problems with trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>with his behavior,</v>

2958
01:57:45.151 --> 01:57:48.180
<v Speaker 2>with any of his past statements?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

2959
01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:50.760
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a perfect angel from heaven,</v>

2960
01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:52.213
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2961
01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:53.880
<v Speaker 2>you're being silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

2962
01:57:53.881 --> 01:57:55.310
<v Speaker 2>I think he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2963
01:57:55.470 --> 01:57:56.290
<v Speaker 2>what's he done well?</v>

2964
01:57:56.290 --> 01:57:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2965
01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Tell me what the worst things you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's done it.</v>

2966
01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:01.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>business wise there's been,</v>

2967
01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:03.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is one of the things that Joey</v>

2968
01:58:03.530 --> 01:58:04.363
<v Speaker 2>Diaz has talked about in the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he knew back from a long time ago </v>

2969
01:58:07.650 --> 01:58:08.483
<v Speaker 2>in the construction business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump was famous for having these </v>

2970
01:58:11.461 --> 01:58:15.490
<v Speaker 2>projects and not paying people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2971
01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:19.320
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't sound very likely if trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't sound likely,</v>

2972
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:20.910
<v Speaker 2>where are these people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are they?</v>

2973
01:58:21.290 --> 01:58:22.550
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't have come out in the press</v>
<v Speaker 2>by now.</v>

2974
01:58:22.580 --> 01:58:24.480
<v Speaker 2>I've come out in the press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's quite a few of them.</v>

2975
01:58:24.481 --> 01:58:25.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll,</v>

2976
01:58:26.010 --> 01:58:27.840
<v Speaker 2>he'll pull some of them up so you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>see some of the stories.</v>

2977
01:58:27.841 --> 01:58:31.110
<v Speaker 2>But was it a what one New York paper?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2978
01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:32.460
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard a couple of times too.</v>

2979
01:58:32.461 --> 01:58:35.370
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of like smaller time </v>
<v Speaker 2>contractors that would take him,</v>

2980
01:58:35.490 --> 01:58:37.190
<v Speaker 2>oh please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some dis,</v>

2981
01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:38.033
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some disgruntled little mom and pop </v>

2982
01:58:39.781 --> 01:58:41.500
<v Speaker 2>shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then a mom and pop</v>

2983
01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:43.453
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get construction company and </v>

2984
01:58:44.561 --> 01:58:45.394
<v Speaker 1>they would get a bid to work on one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his buildings and they would spend all </v>

2985
01:58:47.711 --> 01:58:50.890
<v Speaker 1>this money on it and it would start </v>
<v Speaker 1>working and then he wouldn't pay them.</v>

2986
01:58:51.100 --> 01:58:51.933
<v Speaker 1>And in doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crushed a lot of her business has a </v>

2987
01:58:54.581 --> 01:58:55.414
<v Speaker 1>history of not paying his bills that </v>
<v Speaker 1>offers some insights into his </v>

2988
01:58:57.761 --> 01:58:58.594
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>USA Today is posted an explosive </v>

2989
01:59:01.271 --> 01:59:02.104
<v Speaker 1>investigative story about what appears </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a deep aversion presumptive gop </v>

2990
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:09.880
<v Speaker 1>nomination nominee Donald Trump has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying his bills.</v>

2991
01:59:09.881 --> 01:59:10.714
<v Speaker 1>The short version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>USA Today claims is based on what looks </v>

2992
01:59:13.301 --> 01:59:14.134
<v Speaker 1>like some rather impressive reporting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump has for decades looked for just </v>

2993
01:59:17.591 --> 01:59:18.424
<v Speaker 1>about any excuse he could find to stiff </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone from plumbers to can't make </v>

2994
01:59:22.421 --> 01:59:23.254
<v Speaker 1>this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lawyers who represented him and </v>

2995
01:59:24.821 --> 01:59:27.490
<v Speaker 1>nonpayment lawsuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of fun.</v>

2996
01:59:27.491 --> 01:59:28.324
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every bad story about trump has a </v>

2997
01:59:30.461 --> 01:59:32.510
<v Speaker 1>punchline and that just makes you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>

2998
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:36.910
<v Speaker 1>At least 60 lawsuits along with hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Liens,</v>

2999
01:59:36.911 --> 01:59:40.060

<v Speaker 1>work and any it doesn't sound goes on.</v>

3002
01:59:48.090 --> 01:59:49.690
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't sound good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to defend that.</v>

3003
01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:50.673
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

3004

<v Speaker 1>that doesn't sound good at all.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:54.760
<v Speaker 1>I have a quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close follower of trump.</v>

3007

<v Speaker 1>a mom and that my dishwasher in Florida,</v>

3010
02:00:00.221 --> 02:00:01.150
<v Speaker 1>a plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>painters,</v>

<v Speaker 1>48 waiters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 waiters of lawsuits that God,</v>

3012
02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dozens of bartenders and other hourly </v>

3014
02:00:09.491 --> 02:00:11.950
<v Speaker 1>workers at resorts and clubs east.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you run,</v>

3015
02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:13.680
<v Speaker 1>when you want to imply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3016
02:00:13.690 --> 02:00:16.300
<v Speaker 1>this is $1 billion empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get things like this.</v>

3017
02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:19.400
<v Speaker 1>And when you do it for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be difficult.</v>

3018
02:00:19.450 --> 02:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Washington,</v>

3019
02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson doesn't have those one </v>
<v Speaker 1>to let me know,</v>

3020
02:00:22.451 --> 02:00:23.284
<v Speaker 1>but if he ran for president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might find out that you would have </v>

3021
02:00:24.551 --> 02:00:25.150
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3022
02:00:25.150 --> 02:00:27.310
<v Speaker 1>cause he's not that kind of guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh please.</v>

3023

<v Speaker 1>she is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3025
02:00:31.001 --> 02:00:34.240
<v Speaker 1>I think Richard Branson is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst examples of a sort of,</v>

3026
02:00:34.241 --> 02:00:35.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

3029
02:00:40.061 --> 02:00:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson is about as close to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>devils.</v>

3030
02:00:42.371 --> 02:00:44.720
<v Speaker 1>It's possible to get a no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>How did they do that?</v>

3223
02:06:58.800 --> 02:06:59.633
<v Speaker 1>One of the things he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think sincerity and intelligence and </v>

3224
02:07:02.431 --> 02:07:03.264
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just started speaking honestly and </v>

3225
02:07:04.711 --> 02:07:06.330
<v Speaker 1>plainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did less but better.</v>

3226
02:07:06.331 --> 02:07:07.770
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't a fame whore.</v>

3227
02:07:07.980 --> 02:07:10.020
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't demanding attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just said,</v>

3228
02:07:10.350 --> 02:07:11.183
<v Speaker 1>here's what I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I'm going to do in my life </v>

3229
02:07:12.121 --> 02:07:12.954

<v Speaker 1>and spoke simply and seriously and </v>

3230
02:07:14.341 --> 02:07:17.230
<v Speaker 1>actually did things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who's that crazy guy that he had run</v>

<v Speaker 1>Bald Guy when run Roma bomber,</v>

3233
02:07:20.130 --> 02:07:25.130
<v Speaker 1>I lot around screaming and yelling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's sweating and he's out.</v>

3234
02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:28.650
<v Speaker 1>It looks good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I loved him.</v>

3236
02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:32.033
<v Speaker 1>That video is off God damn classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I worked for Microsoft would be </v>

3237
02:07:35.261 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 1>terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3238
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:36.903
<v Speaker 6>I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have to muster up this level of </v>

3239
02:07:38.561 --> 02:07:40.120
<v Speaker 6>enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Although I get fired.</v>

3240
02:07:40.121 --> 02:07:40.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there he is.</v>

3241
02:07:40.961 --> 02:07:41.794
<v Speaker 6>Look at this.</v>

3242
02:07:41.950 --> 02:07:44.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the monkey something.</v>

3243
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:50.950
<v Speaker 3>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love him.</v>

3244
02:07:51.890 --> 02:07:52.723
<v Speaker 1>This is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still like this because there's </v>

3245
02:07:54.081 --> 02:07:54.914
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a video of him like at </v>

3246
02:07:55.791 --> 02:07:58.760
<v Speaker 1>basketball games and he's like this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the front row in the basketball game.</v>

3247
02:07:59.340 --> 02:08:00.400
<v Speaker 6>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is just who he is.</v>

3248
02:08:00.750 --> 02:08:02.740
<v Speaker 6>Bruce from sterling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3249
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:04.390
<v Speaker 6>Oh that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3250
02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:05.253
<v Speaker 6>He would know that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He probably orchestrated the fucking </v>

3251
02:08:06.701 --> 02:08:08.680
<v Speaker 6>wire tap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was probably a long chess game.</v>

3252
02:08:09.610 --> 02:08:10.443
<v Speaker 6>That son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is one of the most bizarre things </v>

3253
02:08:12.221 --> 02:08:14.080
<v Speaker 6>ever because if you listen to what that </v>
<v Speaker 6>guy said,</v>

3254
02:08:14.081 --> 02:08:17.170
<v Speaker 6>that cost him the clippers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is one of the weirdest.</v>

3255
02:08:17.220 --> 02:08:21.610
<v Speaker 6>And you're wondering outside my area,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Donald Sterling was the guy.</v>

3256
02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:22.990
<v Speaker 6>Well it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it enters into your area.</v>

3257
02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:23.951
<v Speaker 6>Tell me about the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tell me about it.</v>

3258
02:08:23.951 --> 02:08:24.784
<v Speaker 6>Cause it deals with social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was a clippers owner to one of the </v>

3259
02:08:28.361 --> 02:08:29.680
<v Speaker 6>bigger basketball teams,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3260
02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:32.180
<v Speaker 6>The Los Angeles area.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3261
02:08:32.230 --> 02:08:33.063
<v Speaker 6>he has his girlfriend and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want you taking pictures as </v>

3262
02:08:37.031 --> 02:08:37.864
<v Speaker 6>black guys because she takes a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>pictures of these black guys on her </v>

3263
02:08:39.731 --> 02:08:40.870
<v Speaker 6>instagram page.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

3264
02:08:40.990 --> 02:08:41.823
<v Speaker 6>I don't mind if you fuck them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't want you taking pictures </v>

3265
02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:45.820
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

3266
02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:49.750
<v Speaker 6>They conveniently left out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They conveniently left out the,</v>

3267
02:08:50.050 --> 02:08:50.883
<v Speaker 6>I don't care if you fuck them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just don't because it embarrassed him </v>

3268
02:08:53.801 --> 02:08:56.560
<v Speaker 6>because everybody knew it was his </v>
<v Speaker 6>girlfriend and she fucks everybody.</v>

3269
02:08:56.590 --> 02:08:57.423
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So she's got pictures with all these </v>

3270
02:08:58.211 --> 02:08:59.670
<v Speaker 6>stud athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3271
02:08:59.830 --> 02:09:04.180
<v Speaker 6>Everyone knows these shut athletes or </v>
<v Speaker 6>bone in her writing a trainer is Tim.</v>

3272
02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:06.010
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't like you taking pictures.</v>

3273
02:09:06.011 --> 02:09:08.540
<v Speaker 6>What'd you show me there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So here it goes.</v>

3274
02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:09.393
<v Speaker 6>Bothered me a lot that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 6>broadcast that you're associating with </v>

3275
02:09:12.131 --> 02:09:12.964
<v Speaker 6>black people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you have to the man believing to be </v>

3276
02:09:14.471 --> 02:09:17.860
<v Speaker 6>sterling says you can sleep with them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could bring them in,</v>

3277
02:09:17.861 --> 02:09:18.694
<v Speaker 6>you could do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The little I ask you is not to promote </v>

3278
02:09:21.311 --> 02:09:24.310
<v Speaker 6>it on and not to bring them to my games.</v>

3279
02:09:24.490 --> 02:09:26.310
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's him just saying,</v>

3280
02:09:26.311 --> 02:09:28.320
<v Speaker 1>please don't humiliate me because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3281
02:09:28.410 --> 02:09:30.600
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're my girlfriend.</v>

3282
02:09:30.650 --> 02:09:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

3283
02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:35.430
<v Speaker 1>you are ritually humiliating me in </v>
<v Speaker 1>public,</v>

3284
02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:36.960
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's just asking her not to do it,</v>

3285
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:40.410
<v Speaker 1>but she specifically said black eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what if she brought in some fucking</v>

3286
02:09:40.411 --> 02:09:44.180
<v Speaker 1>vikings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant bearded ax wielding.</v>

3287
02:09:45.050 --> 02:09:47.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a complement to the black people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's,</v>

3288
02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:49.830
<v Speaker 1>he's identifying them as like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the master race they are.</v>

3289
02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

3290
02:09:51.181 --> 02:09:52.014
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just some little white guy and you </v>

3291
02:09:52.861 --> 02:09:53.694
<v Speaker 1>keep going out with these like massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>six foot four athletes and you're </v>

3292
02:09:55.561 --> 02:09:57.030
<v Speaker 1>humiliating me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please stop it.</v>

3293
02:09:57.060 --> 02:09:57.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously if she was a coal burner </v>

3294
02:09:59.080 --> 02:09:59.913
<v Speaker 1>and she's just going out and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>black guys and she's just got coal </v>

3295
02:10:02.250 --> 02:10:04.470
<v Speaker 1>burner and so what they call them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3296
02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a snicker liquor.</v>

3297
02:10:08.330 --> 02:10:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Put a Kolber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3298
02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

3299
02:10:11.670 --> 02:10:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Or a a loco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the other one I left too.</v>

3300
02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:14.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3301
02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not as much as Colbert and corden.</v>

3302
02:10:16.851 --> 02:10:19.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just like an old nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

3303
02:10:19.711 --> 02:10:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be something like 1940 </v>
<v Speaker 1>is racist thing,</v>

3304
02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:25.980
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to reclaim it because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>a allowed because I am one.</v>

3305
02:10:25.981 --> 02:10:26.641
<v Speaker 1>That's the rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3306
02:10:26.641 --> 02:10:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the rule these days.</v>

3307
02:10:27.690 --> 02:10:29.480
<v Speaker 1>That's the rule these days in coal </v>
<v Speaker 1>burner,</v>

3308
02:10:29.481 --> 02:10:30.330
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3309
02:10:30.570 --> 02:10:31.403
<v Speaker 1>That's the rule these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can say whatever I want as long as I </v>

3310
02:10:32.611 --> 02:10:33.780
<v Speaker 1>am it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3311
02:10:33.870 --> 02:10:34.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3312
02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:35.033
<v Speaker 2>she's only fucking black guys and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not really putting out for rich white </v>

3313
02:10:37.881 --> 02:10:41.120
<v Speaker 2>husband and he's boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has a water,</v>

3314
02:10:41.121 --> 02:10:43.130
<v Speaker 2>he has a wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

3315
02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is example of the media,</v>

3316
02:10:45.141 --> 02:10:45.641
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just,</v>

3317
02:10:45.641 --> 02:10:46.474
<v Speaker 2>just cherry picking to say that everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>is racist when everyone's not racist </v>

3318
02:10:49.071 --> 02:10:52.640
<v Speaker 2>because his primary motivation in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement had nothing to do with race.</v>

3319
02:10:52.970 --> 02:10:54.740
<v Speaker 2>And you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did he need to say black at all?</v>

3320
02:10:54.741 --> 02:10:55.574
<v Speaker 2>But who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't what he was asking her </v>

3321
02:10:57.111 --> 02:10:57.944
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the thrust of his remarks and </v>

3322
02:10:59.661 --> 02:11:01.910
<v Speaker 2>the media because it is populated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

3323
02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:03.660
<v Speaker 2>not by adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3324
02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:05.000
<v Speaker 2>did this to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it sounds like,</v>

3325
02:11:05.001 --> 02:11:05.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

3326
02:11:05.381 --> 02:11:06.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm speculating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The literal,</v>

3327
02:11:06.891 --> 02:11:09.140
<v Speaker 2>literally the tiny bit you just told me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

3328
02:11:09.170 --> 02:11:10.450
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't sound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem,</v>

3329
02:11:10.460 --> 02:11:12.980
<v Speaker 2>it sounds to me to be in your words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>problematic.</v>

3330
02:11:13.010 --> 02:11:13.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>

3331
02:11:13.401 --> 02:11:14.234
<v Speaker 2>here's another issue with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a private conversation that he </v>

3332
02:11:16.401 --> 02:11:17.234
<v Speaker 2>did not think was being broadcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people are allowed to say fucked up </v>

3333
02:11:20.061 --> 02:11:24.050
<v Speaker 2>things that maybe they shouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>said and it doesn't have to be shared to</v>

3334
02:11:24.051 --> 02:11:26.900
<v Speaker 2>the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he loses his team.</v>

3335
02:11:27.740 --> 02:11:30.650
<v Speaker 2>This is the craziest part about people </v>
<v Speaker 2>bastards.</v>

3336
02:11:30.651 --> 02:11:33.710
<v Speaker 2>The president of the NBA makes his </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>

3337
02:11:33.711 --> 02:11:35.210
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like Nosferatu.</v>

3338
02:11:35.330 --> 02:11:37.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like he just fucking,</v>

3339
02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:39.170
<v Speaker 2>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old president president,</v>

3340
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:40.183
<v Speaker 2>he looks like you popped out of a coffin</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he sits straight up and he reads </v>

3341
02:11:45.261 --> 02:11:46.094
<v Speaker 2>this fucking canned ridiculous speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the horrors of what this guy look </v>

<v Speaker 2>at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at Nosferatu wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no white to his eyes.</v>

3344
02:11:57.111 --> 02:11:59.450
<v Speaker 2>It's all black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't see him out in sunlight.</v>

3345
02:11:59.451 --> 02:12:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a demon.</v>

3346
02:12:01.130 --> 02:12:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Even of the white stuff is all red blood</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind.</v>

3347
02:12:05.630 --> 02:12:07.850
<v Speaker 2>He's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like a pure blood.</v>

3348
02:12:07.851 --> 02:12:10.370
<v Speaker 2>You know the ones that are like Paler </v>
<v Speaker 2>and older than are the vows.</v>

3349
02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:12.290
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't made.</v>

3350
02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:14.170
<v Speaker 2>He was born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>born vampire.</v>

3351
02:12:14.210 --> 02:12:15.043
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3352
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:16.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Anyway,</v>

3353
02:12:16.620 --> 02:12:20.780
<v Speaker 2>he was very unreasonable the way he </v>
<v Speaker 2>described it.</v>

3354
02:12:20.781 --> 02:12:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Look with what the guy said was not </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>

3355
02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:25.610
<v Speaker 2>It was sorted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was gross,</v>

3356
02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:28.550
<v Speaker 2>but more gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have said if I was him,</v>

3357
02:12:28.700 --> 02:12:29.533
<v Speaker 2>how gross is it that we're listening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this man's private conversation and </v>

3358
02:12:32.301 --> 02:12:33.134
<v Speaker 2>judge him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want people to say this stuff in </v>

3359
02:12:34.221 --> 02:12:35.300
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

3360
02:12:35.301 --> 02:12:36.620
<v Speaker 2>the guy was drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3361
02:12:36.621 --> 02:12:38.240
<v Speaker 2>He was drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was with his mistress.</v>

3362
02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:39.710
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3363
02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:41.690
<v Speaker 2>that seems completely reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement to me.</v>

3364
02:12:41.900 --> 02:12:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to say fucked up things.</v>

3365
02:12:44.230 --> 02:12:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you'll go from cheating on you with a</v>

3366
02:12:45.771 --> 02:12:47.810
<v Speaker 2>bunch of black guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would not say,</v>

3367
02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:50.030
<v Speaker 2>why are you cheating on with me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these guys,</v>

3368
02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:51.380
<v Speaker 2>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3369
02:12:51.381 --> 02:12:52.070
<v Speaker 2>but listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

3370
02:12:52.070 --> 02:12:53.570
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had a girlfriend,</v>

3371
02:12:53.571 --> 02:12:53.970
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3372
02:12:53.970 --> 02:12:54.381
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

3373
02:12:54.381 --> 02:12:55.880

3374
02:12:55.881 --> 02:12:57.080
<v Speaker 2>But Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was nice.</v>

3375
02:12:57.120 --> 02:12:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3376
02:12:58.670 --> 02:13:01.220
<v Speaker 2>My boss now is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so used to these,</v>

3377
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:04.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these sort of a flippant compliments.</v>

3378
02:13:04.341 --> 02:13:06.260
<v Speaker 2>He now no longer believes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he says,</v>

3379
02:13:06.261 --> 02:13:08.480
<v Speaker 2>you have to give me the same exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>compliment three times,</v>

3380
02:13:08.481 --> 02:13:12.230
<v Speaker 2>so I know you actually mean it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a three.</v>

3381
02:13:12.231 --> 02:13:14.810
<v Speaker 2>Compliments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compliments and then a statement.</v>

3382
02:13:15.370 --> 02:13:16.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a compliment,</v>

3383
02:13:16.101 --> 02:13:16.970
<v Speaker 2>compliment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compliment,</v>

3384
02:13:16.971 --> 02:13:17.804
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

3385
02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:21.433
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't give me on three separate </v>

3386
02:13:22.701 --> 02:13:24.230
<v Speaker 2>occasions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unrelated,</v>

3387
02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:25.760
<v Speaker 2>unrelated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>separate occasions,</v>

3388
02:13:25.761 --> 02:13:26.810
<v Speaker 2>the same compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll know.</v>

3389
02:13:26.811 --> 02:13:28.190
<v Speaker 2>It's just you being flipping a </v>
<v Speaker 2>flatterer,</v>

3390
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:29.900
<v Speaker 2>which I think is reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no.</v>

3391
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 2>If you had a girlfriend and she</v>

3392
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:32.903
<v Speaker 1>was cheating on you and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>exclusively cheating on you with black </v>

3393
02:13:35.101 --> 02:13:36.870
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you had a conversation with her,</v>

3394
02:13:36.930 --> 02:13:39.630
<v Speaker 1>you would not say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind you sleeping with all these</v>

3395
02:13:39.631 --> 02:13:41.040
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would say,</v>

3396
02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind you sleeping with all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>black men.</v>

3397
02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:43.913
<v Speaker 1>You would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how people talk because it's a </v>

3398
02:13:45.781 --> 02:13:48.870
<v Speaker 1>group that is very identifiably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not you and what you're,</v>

3399
02:13:49.100 --> 02:13:51.840
<v Speaker 1>what you're implicitly saying is what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>it that they have that I don't have?</v>

3400
02:13:51.841 --> 02:13:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's what's going on there.</v>

3401
02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:55.733
<v Speaker 1>He's being racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's identifying a pattern of behavior </v>

3402
02:13:58.891 --> 02:14:01.920
<v Speaker 1>from her and it's like that's how we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would all talk.</v>

3403
02:14:01.950 --> 02:14:04.770
<v Speaker 1>But he specifically broadcast that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're with them.</v>

3404
02:14:04.771 --> 02:14:07.900
<v Speaker 1>It's even more bizarre than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puts even more bizarre because,</v>

3405
02:14:08.050 --> 02:14:09.840
<v Speaker 1>cause he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind if you fucked them.</v>

3406
02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the best fucking boyfriend in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is funny too that they bleeped</v>

3407
02:14:14.011 --> 02:14:14.700
<v Speaker 1>out fuck.</v>

3408
02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:19.070
<v Speaker 1>And they put in in parentheses sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>with like they change.</v>

3409
02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:21.060
<v Speaker 1>People are dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They change like the,</v>

3410
02:14:21.070 --> 02:14:23.160
<v Speaker 1>like the trend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Orlando transcript,</v>

3411
02:14:23.161 --> 02:14:27.990
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't allowed to have any mention</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Islam or isis whatsoever.</v>

3412
02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:29.640
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that?</v>

3413
02:14:29.730 --> 02:14:30.421
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3414
02:14:30.421 --> 02:14:31.230
<v Speaker 1>The way that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3415
02:14:31.230 --> 02:14:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I hate this cause I'm like a free speech</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist.</v>

3416
02:14:33.241 --> 02:14:34.074
<v Speaker 1>I want people to have conversations like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and far worse in public all the </v>

3417
02:14:36.001 --> 02:14:36.834
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere because I want to rob words </v>

3418
02:14:37.591 --> 02:14:39.150
<v Speaker 1>of their magical powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3419
02:14:39.310 --> 02:14:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really going on.</v>

3420
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:42.743
<v Speaker 1>Really think I want people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody wants to use the n word </v>

3421
02:14:45.091 --> 02:14:47.340
<v Speaker 1>because they don't like black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know about it.</v>

3422
02:14:47.460 --> 02:14:48.293
<v Speaker 1>I want to know who the racists are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know who the sexist so I want </v>

3423
02:14:51.331 --> 02:14:52.050
<v Speaker 1>to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I wanna be friends.</v>

3424
02:14:52.050 --> 02:14:53.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm joking.</v>

3425
02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally joking.</v>

3426
02:14:53.881 --> 02:14:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very reasonable.</v>

3427
02:14:55.021 --> 02:14:55.854
<v Speaker 1>I want to know people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you force people to sign up to </v>

3428
02:14:58.741 --> 02:15:01.230
<v Speaker 1>bogus speech codes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows who anyone else's.</v>

3429
02:15:01.290 --> 02:15:05.100
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't change their intent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact it can make it worse because</v>

3430
02:15:05.101 --> 02:15:06.820
<v Speaker 1>when you press that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3431
02:15:06.821 --> 02:15:07.654
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll open it up and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get drunk for a bottleneck and we're on </v>

3432
02:15:09.571 --> 02:15:11.100
<v Speaker 1>the same page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're on the same page.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I want all this stuff to happen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes I do.</v>

3435
02:15:14.820 --> 02:15:16.050

<v Speaker 1>but I've forgotten.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're saying this is true.</v>

3443
02:15:34.410 --> 02:15:35.243
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they got ridiculed and </v>

3444
02:15:35.791 --> 02:15:38.040
<v Speaker 1>humiliated into releasing the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>full transcript,</v>

3445

<v Speaker 1>I hate any time that people don't quote </v>

3447
02:15:44.461 --> 02:15:45.930
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's to like,</v>

3448
02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:46.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Oh god,</v>

3449
02:15:46.921 --> 02:15:47.760
<v Speaker 1>people can't cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's where,</v>

3450
02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:51.000
<v Speaker 1>why would they think that would be okay </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do?</v>

3451
02:15:51.001 --> 02:15:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Why would the Department of Justice do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

3452
02:15:53.070 --> 02:15:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Because it's an it because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3453
02:15:54.541 --> 02:15:54.841
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3454
02:15:54.841 --> 02:15:55.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loretta Lynch,</v>

3455
02:15:55.951 --> 02:15:57.480
<v Speaker 1>the Attorney General,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are Democrats.</v>

3456
02:15:57.481 --> 02:15:59.100
<v Speaker 1>They are pandering to Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very simple.</v>

3457
02:15:59.130 --> 02:16:00.390
<v Speaker 1>There are pandering to Muslims,</v>

3458
02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:03.370
<v Speaker 1>the pandering to Muslims and </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstration.</v>

3459
02:16:03.371 --> 02:16:07.360
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a shit about gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is bizarre that they would want,</v>

3460
02:16:07.490 --> 02:16:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit to take out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>references to Islam.</v>

3461
02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:11.680
<v Speaker 1>He described like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

3462
02:16:11.681 --> 02:16:12.640
<v Speaker 1>he's like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh La la,</v>

3463
02:16:12.641 --> 02:16:13.271
<v Speaker 1>la La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3464
02:16:13.271 --> 02:16:13.950
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3465
02:16:13.950 --> 02:16:14.561
<v Speaker 1>giving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the,</v>

3466
02:16:14.561 --> 02:16:16.000
<v Speaker 1>doing the Shahada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God knows what else.</v>

3467
02:16:16.001 --> 02:16:16.401
<v Speaker 1>Saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3468
02:16:16.401 --> 02:16:17.620
<v Speaker 1>in the name of Allah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of,</v>

3469
02:16:17.621 --> 02:16:18.550
<v Speaker 1>most of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most great,</v>

3470
02:16:18.551 --> 02:16:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3471
02:16:19.991 --> 02:16:21.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this for Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a proud Muslim.</v>

3472
02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:23.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm killing in the name of Allah and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of it.</v>

3473
02:16:23.771 --> 02:16:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I think even when they put the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcript back,</v>

3474
02:16:25.631 --> 02:16:27.250
<v Speaker 1>I think they changed Allah to God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3475
02:16:27.251 --> 02:16:29.770
<v Speaker 1>just to wind up Christians just to Piss </v>
<v Speaker 1>us off,</v>

3476
02:16:29.771 --> 02:16:30.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3477
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:31.990
<v Speaker 2>just to wind people up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3478
02:16:32.020 --> 02:16:33.610
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to sort of muddy the waters,</v>

3479
02:16:33.611 --> 02:16:34.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just said,</v>

3480
02:16:34.250 --> 02:16:35.200
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said religious,</v>

3481
02:16:35.220 --> 02:16:37.210
<v Speaker 2>religious images,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive.</v>

3482
02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:38.193
<v Speaker 2>That's a massive piece of deception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's discuss the words like that course </v>

3483
02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:42.903
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the censorship and changing all the </v>

3484
02:16:44.231 --> 02:16:45.064
<v Speaker 2>rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that you have the power to </v>

3485
02:16:46.211 --> 02:16:47.200
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3486
02:16:47.201 --> 02:16:51.190
<v Speaker 2>it's obscene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a direct violation of the press.</v>

3487
02:16:51.430 --> 02:16:52.263
<v Speaker 2>Direct violation of journalism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribute information that's so </v>

3488
02:16:56.051 --> 02:17:00.900
<v Speaker 2>distorted like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost worse than the motivations behind</v>

3489
02:17:00.901 --> 02:17:01.734
<v Speaker 2>the fact they did it is the contempt and</v>
<v Speaker 2>low esteem in which they must hold the </v>

3490
02:17:05.801 --> 02:17:06.634
<v Speaker 2>public and the press to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we would think that was okay and </v>

3491
02:17:10.031 --> 02:17:13.990
<v Speaker 2>put up with it and not know what was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gaps that they redacted.</v>

3492
02:17:14.170 --> 02:17:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have they commented on this?</v>

3493
02:17:15.670 --> 02:17:16.181
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

3494
02:17:16.181 --> 02:17:17.014
<v Speaker 2>they got bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got so ridiculed by all sides that </v>

3495
02:17:19.091 --> 02:17:23.980
<v Speaker 2>they released a new transcript where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they think fewer explanations.</v>

3496
02:17:23.980 --> 02:17:25.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was complete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>complete,</v>

3497
02:17:25.841 --> 02:17:29.380
<v Speaker 2>complete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was much better because it was insane</v>

3498
02:17:29.381 --> 02:17:31.330
<v Speaker 2>that they think they could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

3499
02:17:31.390 --> 02:17:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Well they didn't get away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but imagine them thinking they could get</v>

3500
02:17:34.481 --> 02:17:35.314
<v Speaker 2>away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What that says about their opinion of </v>

3501
02:17:37.121 --> 02:17:39.760
<v Speaker 2>the public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's almost worse.</v>

3502
02:17:40.390 --> 02:17:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that,</v>

3503
02:17:41.771 --> 02:17:43.600
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their sense of entitlement,</v>

3504
02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:46.810
<v Speaker 2>the amount of power that they think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can walk reality.</v>

3505
02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is warping reality.</v>

3506
02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 100% more pro.</v>

3507
02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:50.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it,</v>

3508
02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:51.873
<v Speaker 2>it creates space for people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for idiots like sally cone to say this </v>

3509
02:17:54.431 --> 02:17:55.260
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3510
02:17:55.260 --> 02:17:59.140
<v Speaker 2>homophobically motivated fucking wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>a transcript or is it not a transcript,</v>

3511
02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:00.493
<v Speaker 2>the transcript,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're suppose to be able to hear it on </v>

3512
02:18:01.230 --> 02:18:03.070
<v Speaker 2>the script.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck did he say?</v>

3513
02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3514
02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:06.790
<v Speaker 2>and they sense it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every single mention,</v>

3515
02:18:06.791 --> 02:18:07.990
<v Speaker 2>and this is not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3516
02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:09.093
<v Speaker 2>usual rightwing kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why aren't your naming Islam kind of </v>

3517
02:18:11.711 --> 02:18:16.711
<v Speaker 2>stuff for this attorney general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loretta Lynch refused Wednesday to say,</v>

3518
02:18:16.901 --> 02:18:17.734
<v Speaker 2>who made the decision to remove </v>
<v Speaker 2>references to the Islamic state and its </v>

3519
02:18:19.991 --> 02:18:23.620
<v Speaker 2>leader from the publicly released </v>
<v Speaker 2>version of the transcript of the nine 11</v>

3520
02:18:23.621 --> 02:18:26.120
<v Speaker 2>call involving the Orlando nightclub </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooter.</v>

3521
02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:29.710
<v Speaker 2>The goal of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what listen to this,</v>

3522
02:18:29.980 --> 02:18:33.130
<v Speaker 2>the goal is of course the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>transparency.</v>

3523
02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:33.993
<v Speaker 2>The initial thought was that we did not </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to provide a further platform for </v>

3524
02:18:37.511 --> 02:18:41.080
<v Speaker 2>the propaganda of the killer bull shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a load of crap.</v>

3525
02:18:41.081 --> 02:18:42.850
<v Speaker 2>That's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's a lie.</v>

3526
02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Of course it became an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We decided we would go ahead and release</v>

3527
02:18:46.241 --> 02:18:47.074
<v Speaker 2>the full transcript.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lynch said when's she must've released </v>

3528
02:18:49.541 --> 02:18:50.960
<v Speaker 2>the full one if she said it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

3529
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they have,</v>

3530
02:18:51.971 --> 02:18:53.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows if they,</v>

3531
02:18:53.561 --> 02:18:55.870
<v Speaker 2>if they really did really sit or if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>change certain words,</v>

3532
02:18:55.871 --> 02:18:56.920
<v Speaker 2>who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3533
02:18:56.950 --> 02:18:59.680
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when we have no way of telling,</v>

3534
02:18:59.710 --> 02:19:02.970
<v Speaker 2>and this certainly does not inspire us </v>
<v Speaker 2>with confidence that even even the,</v>

3535
02:19:03.310 --> 02:19:06.190
<v Speaker 2>even the released one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this statement right here.</v>

3536
02:19:06.550 --> 02:19:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second.</v>

3537
02:19:07.721 --> 02:19:08.554
<v Speaker 2>Do we trust them even to have released </v>
<v Speaker 2>the real one now that we know what </v>

3538
02:19:10.121 --> 02:19:11.020
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing.</v>

3539
02:19:11.020 --> 02:19:13.510
<v Speaker 2>Once you say you released the real one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

3540
02:19:13.610 --> 02:19:16.510
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like it's going to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Press on.</v>

3541
02:19:16.511 --> 02:19:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Who decided to remove the references to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Isol as well as the name of the deceased</v>

3542
02:19:21.011 --> 02:19:22.390
<v Speaker 2>shooter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Omar Martine.</v>

3543
02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:23.253
<v Speaker 2>Lynn Lynch remained vague.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go into the detail of </v>

3544
02:19:26.471 --> 02:19:27.304
<v Speaker 2>the process behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lynch said I review was not to further </v>

3545
02:19:30.261 --> 02:19:32.730
<v Speaker 2>spread the propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once it became a distraction,</v>

3546
02:19:32.731 --> 02:19:33.564
<v Speaker 2>when we release the whole transcript,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what tell me and you know that we know </v>

3547
02:19:37.161 --> 02:19:38.810
<v Speaker 2>how you know it's a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3548
02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:40.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least how,</v>

3549
02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:43.070
<v Speaker 2>you know how stupid these people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They release,</v>

3550
02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:43.933
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the deadliest shooting in </v>

3551
02:19:46.131 --> 02:19:47.150
<v Speaker 2>American history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3552
02:19:47.151 --> 02:19:48.560
<v Speaker 2>The deadliest mass shooting in American </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

3553
02:19:48.561 --> 02:19:51.290
<v Speaker 2>It is the biggest news in the country </v>
<v Speaker 2>for weeks.</v>

3554
02:19:52.100 --> 02:19:55.820
<v Speaker 2>They released the deadliest mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting in America.</v>

3555
02:19:55.821 --> 02:19:56.654
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

3556
02:19:56.680 --> 02:19:57.070
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

3557
02:19:57.070 --> 02:19:59.940
<v Speaker 2>There was one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was showed to other ones that were</v>

3558
02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:02.660
<v Speaker 2>really similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which one had more,</v>

3559
02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:03.673
<v Speaker 2>could just google that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Orlando was not the deadliest mass </v>

3560
02:20:06.201 --> 02:20:09.750
<v Speaker 2>shooting in American history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Google that because there was this,</v>

3561
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:11.570
<v Speaker 2>what can the assumption is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top five.</v>

3562
02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

3563
02:20:12.771 --> 02:20:13.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3564
02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:14.570
<v Speaker 2>this is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was horrible.</v>

3565
02:20:14.571 --> 02:20:16.760
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just for clarity's sake,</v>

3566
02:20:16.761 --> 02:20:18.740
<v Speaker 2>I think I would like to know if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong about that,</v>

3567
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:20.330
<v Speaker 2>but it just assume that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3568
02:20:20.331 --> 02:20:22.160
<v Speaker 2>it's the biggest news story in America </v>
<v Speaker 2>for three weeks,</v>

3569
02:20:22.190 --> 02:20:23.023
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the eyes of the world media we're </v>

3570
02:20:24.471 --> 02:20:27.380
<v Speaker 2>watching and this guy dialed nine one </v>
<v Speaker 2>one right?</v>

3571
02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:31.910
<v Speaker 2>And made a phone call immediately before</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it was,</v>

3572
02:20:31.911 --> 02:20:32.744
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think that you can gerrymander that </v>

3573
02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:42.040
<v Speaker 2>is so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so mind bogglingly stupid given the</v>

3574
02:20:42.261 --> 02:20:45.770
<v Speaker 2>suspicion with which normal people </v>
<v Speaker 2>already hold the authorities,</v>

3575
02:20:45.771 --> 02:20:48.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the politicization swirling around,</v>

3576
02:20:48.141 --> 02:20:49.310
<v Speaker 2>this is so stupid.</v>

3577
02:20:49.490 --> 02:20:52.070
<v Speaker 2>But think also if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if what she was saying was true,</v>

3578
02:20:52.071 --> 02:20:54.860
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we did this to stop,</v>

3579
02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:56.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spread of his hateful messages and </v>

3580
02:20:57.561 --> 02:20:58.820
<v Speaker 2>to avoid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3581
02:20:58.850 --> 02:21:02.630
<v Speaker 2>more attention beyond Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's more attention on now?</v>

3582
02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:03.793
<v Speaker 2>Now that funding has gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all anyone wants to talk about it in </v>

3583
02:21:05.301 --> 02:21:07.550
<v Speaker 2>that transcript is the words that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>kept out.</v>

3584
02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:08.953
<v Speaker 2>All anybody will ever want to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>in relation to that transcript for the </v>

3585
02:21:11.841 --> 02:21:12.674
<v Speaker 2>rest of time is how the government cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the names of Isis and even his own </v>

3586
02:21:17.361 --> 02:21:17.931
<v Speaker 2>name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3587
02:21:17.931 --> 02:21:21.020
<v Speaker 2>like the cutout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything remotely Islamic looking,</v>

3588
02:21:21.170 --> 02:21:24.740
<v Speaker 2>any Arabic words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything [inaudible] cleansed it so that</v>

3589
02:21:24.741 --> 02:21:28.520
<v Speaker 2>if you had only read that transcript and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you knew nothing about the case,</v>

3590
02:21:28.730 --> 02:21:30.410
<v Speaker 2>you might think the guy was just some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3591
02:21:30.650 --> 02:21:33.800
<v Speaker 2>straight white male homophobic shooter </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Charleston,</v>

3592
02:21:33.930 --> 02:21:34.910
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3593
02:21:34.911 --> 02:21:36.270
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to hide his name there.</v>

3594
02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They a bunch of weird name.</v>

3595
02:21:37.791 --> 02:21:40.610
<v Speaker 2>They hit his name like we didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>his name.</v>

3596
02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.130
<v Speaker 2>They hid his name so that if you read </v>
<v Speaker 2>that document,</v>

3597
02:21:43.460 --> 02:21:46.550
<v Speaker 2>you could have been persuaded to believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this was some,</v>

3598
02:21:46.551 --> 02:21:47.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>redneck,</v>

3599
02:21:47.541 --> 02:21:50.540
<v Speaker 2>homophobic Christian killer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course the left was saying,</v>

3600
02:21:50.541 --> 02:21:51.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3601
02:21:53.090 --> 02:21:54.590
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is no better than blah,</v>

3602
02:21:54.591 --> 02:21:55.071
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

3603
02:21:55.071 --> 02:21:55.904
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the kind of like excuse making </v>

3604
02:21:57.740 --> 02:22:01.190
<v Speaker 2>and molly coddling and pandering and </v>
<v Speaker 2>weaseling and,</v>

3605
02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:02.450
<v Speaker 2>and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's use,</v>

3606
02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:06.290
<v Speaker 2>let's use a Muslim killing gays as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse to attack the questions again,</v>

3607
02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:07.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3608
02:22:07.460 --> 02:22:09.740
<v Speaker 2>all of this stuff that the left was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

3609
02:22:09.770 --> 02:22:10.603
<v Speaker 2>the government legitimized and assisted </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it redacted that transcript </v>

3610
02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:16.213
<v Speaker 2>appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that it's ridiculous to think that </v>

3611
02:22:18.401 --> 02:22:19.234
<v Speaker 2>they thought they'd get away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also shows how much fear they </v>

3612
02:22:21.291 --> 02:22:24.980
<v Speaker 2>have of Islam and Muslim people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

3613
02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:26.460
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a massive</v>

3614
02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:27.293
<v Speaker 6>fear in this country and that was the </v>
<v Speaker 6>same fear that led them to suppress the </v>

3615
02:22:30.151 --> 02:22:33.120
<v Speaker 6>images from Charlie Abdo that got those </v>
<v Speaker 6>cartoonists killed.</v>

3616
02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:34.141
<v Speaker 6>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3617
02:22:34.141 --> 02:22:36.820
<v Speaker 6>there was a massive failure of the press</v>
<v Speaker 6>or no one,</v>

3618
02:22:36.821 --> 02:22:38.010
<v Speaker 6>and we ran them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You guys,</v>

3619
02:22:38.011 --> 02:22:41.370
<v Speaker 6>Breitbart did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and Kudos to you because that was a huge</v>

3620
02:22:41.371 --> 02:22:43.050
<v Speaker 6>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Time magazine,</v>

3621
02:22:43.051 --> 02:22:45.420
<v Speaker 6>The New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all those people denied.</v>

3622
02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:46.673
<v Speaker 6>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3623
02:22:46.740 --> 02:22:48.020
<v Speaker 6>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're not running that.</v>

3624
02:22:48.040 --> 02:22:48.873
<v Speaker 6>We don't want to die.</v>

3625
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:49.611
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3626
02:22:49.611 --> 02:22:50.600
<v Speaker 2>we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew.</v>

3627
02:22:50.601 --> 02:22:51.500
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We always sold,</v>

3628
02:22:51.501 --> 02:22:53.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left is so stunning and brave,</v>

3629
02:22:53.410 --> 02:22:54.860
<v Speaker 2>responsible for all these great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3630
02:22:55.220 --> 02:22:56.053
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social triumphs and civil rights </v>

3631
02:22:57.351 --> 02:22:59.360
<v Speaker 2>victories and all the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3632
02:23:00.020 --> 02:23:00.853
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's conservative taking all the risks </v>

3633
02:23:02.991 --> 02:23:04.730
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks that way to me.</v>

3634
02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:05.593
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going at the end of the month to </v>

3635
02:23:06.201 --> 02:23:07.910
<v Speaker 2>Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think I told you this.</v>

3636
02:23:08.090 --> 02:23:09.650
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't know this yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3637
02:23:09.710 --> 02:23:10.543
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting at the end of the month to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden to lead to gay pride march </v>

3638
02:23:12.561 --> 02:23:16.190
<v Speaker 2>through a Muslim ghetto because to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been nice knowing you dude,</v>

3639
02:23:16.220 --> 02:23:17.053
<v Speaker 2>and a black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>glad I got to come on before the end of </v>

3640
02:23:19.250 --> 02:23:23.120
<v Speaker 2>the month because to me it seems like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the point of gay pride,</v>

3641
02:23:23.121 --> 02:23:25.000
<v Speaker 2>if there is one any more is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

3642
02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:28.350
<v Speaker 2>that's very much in debate in the west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3643
02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:31.580
<v Speaker 2>surely this was the point of gay pride </v>
<v Speaker 2>was always to,</v>

3644
02:23:31.581 --> 02:23:32.414
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sort of March defiantly through </v>

3645
02:23:33.741 --> 02:23:35.900
<v Speaker 2>areas of social conservatism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactionary,</v>

3646
02:23:35.930 --> 02:23:37.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious bigotry in all the rest of it.</v>

3647
02:23:38.540 --> 02:23:39.373
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's only coming really from one </v>

3648
02:23:39.981 --> 02:23:43.430
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't think there's very much,</v>

3649
02:23:44.240 --> 02:23:45.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is an absurd,</v>

3650
02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:46.273
<v Speaker 2>it's an absurd and ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of perspective to suggest that </v>

3651
02:23:48.651 --> 02:23:49.484
<v Speaker 2>somebody who doesn't want to bake a cake</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some lesbians is equivalent to a </v>

3652
02:23:52.071 --> 02:23:54.920
<v Speaker 2>creed that wants to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that throws homosexuals off roofs where,</v>

3653
02:23:55.100 --> 02:23:56.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 million people live in,</v>

3654
02:23:56.811 --> 02:23:59.690
<v Speaker 2>in Islamic countries where the penalty </v>
<v Speaker 2>for gay sex is death.</v>

3655
02:23:59.960 --> 02:24:00.621
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

3656
02:24:00.621 --> 02:24:01.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>British Muslims,</v>

3657
02:24:01.940 --> 02:24:02.773
<v Speaker 2>100% of British Muslims think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality is not an acceptable </v>

3658
02:24:05.091 --> 02:24:08.240
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle choice and 52% of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What gay sex made illegal.</v>

3659
02:24:08.420 --> 02:24:11.120
<v Speaker 2>This is coming from one religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one,</v>

3660
02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:14.190
<v Speaker 2>and stop lying to people that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's some equivalence between,</v>

3661
02:24:14.191 --> 02:24:15.024
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the discomfort occasionally felt by </v>

3662
02:24:16.101 --> 02:24:19.640
<v Speaker 2>Christians about gay marriage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims murdering homosexuals.</v>

3663
02:24:19.641 --> 02:24:22.260
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking stop it because nobody </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes you anymore.</v>

3664
02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:23.193
<v Speaker 6>We were talking about this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that Michael Shermer had an excellent </v>

3665
02:24:25.091 --> 02:24:25.924
<v Speaker 6>article about that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>about Islam being the one religion that </v>

3666
02:24:28.511 --> 02:24:30.400
<v Speaker 6>didn't go through the enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

3667
02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:32.320
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a very illuminating article.</v>

3668
02:24:32.321 --> 02:24:37.321
<v Speaker 6>It really shows you how sort of isolated</v>
<v Speaker 6>their ideology has remained and it's one</v>

3669
02:24:39.311 --> 02:24:42.970
<v Speaker 6>of the very few ideologies from that </v>
<v Speaker 6>long ago.</v>

3670
02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:45.490
<v Speaker 6>It remains fairly untouched.</v>

3671
02:24:45.890 --> 02:24:47.080
<v Speaker 2>The reason that I think for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

3672
02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:48.400
<v Speaker 2>he may have touched on this in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>article,</v>

3673
02:24:49.210 --> 02:24:50.043
<v Speaker 2>is there a structural differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>between Islam and every other major </v>

3674
02:24:52.211 --> 02:24:53.044
<v Speaker 2>world religion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3675
02:24:53.170 --> 02:24:54.730
<v Speaker 2>So if you take the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Quran,</v>

3676
02:24:54.731 --> 02:24:56.460
<v Speaker 2>the sooner and the headaches and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it together.</v>

3677
02:24:56.470 --> 02:24:57.303
<v Speaker 2>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

3678
02:24:57.310 --> 02:24:58.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims will say this is the final </v>

3679
02:24:59.231 --> 02:25:01.330
<v Speaker 2>perfect and unalterable would have got </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Quran right.</v>

3680
02:25:01.331 --> 02:25:05.050
<v Speaker 2>And it's supported by the [inaudible] of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sayings and doings of been molested.</v>

3681
02:25:05.470 --> 02:25:06.303
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no other religion makes a claim for </v>

3682
02:25:08.561 --> 02:25:10.630
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know that God will never come back.</v>

3683
02:25:10.631 --> 02:25:11.464
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other religions make a specifically </v>

3684
02:25:12.281 --> 02:25:13.810
<v Speaker 2>specifically opposite claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3685
02:25:13.890 --> 02:25:14.723
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no other religion I think apart </v>

3686
02:25:15.791 --> 02:25:16.624
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart from Islam has proven itself so </v>

3687
02:25:18.491 --> 02:25:19.680
<v Speaker 2>resistant to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3688
02:25:19.690 --> 02:25:21.230
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to maternity and,</v>

3689
02:25:21.231 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 2>and so in capable of adapting to modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>

3690
02:25:24.011 --> 02:25:24.844
<v Speaker 2>Christianity for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does a wonderful job of aligning itself </v>

3691
02:25:27.611 --> 02:25:30.280
<v Speaker 2>with capitalist societies and adapting </v>
<v Speaker 2>and changing with the times.</v>

3692
02:25:30.290 --> 02:25:31.960
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in my view,</v>

3693
02:25:31.961 --> 02:25:32.794
<v Speaker 2>maybe not entirely in yours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in my view certainly in the last </v>

3694
02:25:34.900 --> 02:25:35.733
<v Speaker 2>hundred years has been nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing but a net positive for public </v>

3695
02:25:36.971 --> 02:25:39.310
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Islam of course,</v>

3696
02:25:39.311 --> 02:25:40.144
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of locks down into the social </v>

3697
02:25:46.541 --> 02:25:49.720
<v Speaker 2>attitudes that people had when Islam was</v>
<v Speaker 2>founded.</v>

3698
02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity isn't Christina,</v>

3699
02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:53.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've even got the Anglican church,</v>

3700
02:25:53.021 --> 02:25:54.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now women bishops,</v>

3701
02:25:54.161 --> 02:25:55.510
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage is probably whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3702
02:25:55.790 --> 02:25:58.750
<v Speaker 2>there's the Christianity is adapting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff and is changing,</v>

3703
02:25:59.140 --> 02:26:00.250
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

3704
02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Islam has some problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3705
02:26:01.241 --> 02:26:03.400
<v Speaker 2>another structural problem of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it is that even,</v>

3706
02:26:03.430 --> 02:26:04.263
<v Speaker 2>even Islam zone scholars say that where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Quran contradicts itself is of </v>

3707
02:26:08.051 --> 02:26:08.884
<v Speaker 2>course it does in many places because </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of it is just sort of plagiarized </v>

3708
02:26:10.961 --> 02:26:12.580
<v Speaker 2>old testament and the rest of it is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad.</v>

3709
02:26:12.990 --> 02:26:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

3710
02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:18.550
<v Speaker 2>where it contradicts itself as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle of abrogation which means that</v>

3711
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:21.940
<v Speaker 2>reverses versus that will reveal to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed later,</v>

3712
02:26:22.090 --> 02:26:25.570
<v Speaker 2>chronologically in time a supersede the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier ones.</v>

3713
02:26:25.570 --> 02:26:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Well the problem is at the earlier ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the peace,</v>

3714
02:26:26.951 --> 02:26:27.784
<v Speaker 2>love and understanding ones and later </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones when he was a warlord of the ones </v>

3715
02:26:29.741 --> 02:26:30.340
<v Speaker 2>that kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill,</v>

3716
02:26:30.340 --> 02:26:31.173
<v Speaker 2>kill the infidel versus all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So according to Islam zone scholars and </v>

3717
02:26:33.641 --> 02:26:35.500
<v Speaker 2>they don't think there's any real </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreement on this.</v>

3718
02:26:35.950 --> 02:26:39.910
<v Speaker 2>The belly coast verses in the Quran take</v>
<v Speaker 2>precedence over the peace,</v>

3719
02:26:39.911 --> 02:26:42.550
<v Speaker 2>love and understanding versus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course you know,</v>

3720
02:26:42.551 --> 02:26:45.460
<v Speaker 2>the other structural problems with </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion that prevent it from it,</v>

3721
02:26:45.461 --> 02:26:46.294
<v Speaker 2>from engaging with maternity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual inquiry inequality for </v>

3722
02:26:48.071 --> 02:26:48.610
<v Speaker 2>women and gays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will,</v>

3723
02:26:48.610 --> 02:26:49.443
<v Speaker 2>the rest of it have led to things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people have heard me say this </v>

3724
02:26:51.911 --> 02:26:52.990
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's an interesting,</v>

3725
02:26:52.991 --> 02:26:53.824
<v Speaker 2>just to just one little data point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't a single world class </v>

3726
02:26:55.481 --> 02:26:57.130
<v Speaker 2>university anywhere in the Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

3727
02:26:57.250 --> 02:26:58.083
<v Speaker 2>Not One.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why I think you can fill in the gaps </v>

3728
02:26:59.951 --> 02:27:01.150
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3729
02:27:01.151 --> 02:27:03.070
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to claim that that is somehow equivalent</v>

3730
02:27:03.071 --> 02:27:03.791
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

3731
02:27:03.791 --> 02:27:04.780
<v Speaker 2>as we say to these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this,</v>

3732
02:27:04.781 --> 02:27:06.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to memories pizza is,</v>

3733
02:27:06.921 --> 02:27:07.754
<v Speaker 2>is insane.</v>

3734
02:27:07.780 --> 02:27:09.550
<v Speaker 2>It's completely absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for the government to,</v>

3735
02:27:09.551 --> 02:27:10.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

3736
02:27:10.061 --> 02:27:14.260
<v Speaker 2>to deny gay people the right to educate </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and you know,</v>

3737
02:27:14.261 --> 02:27:15.094
<v Speaker 2>and deny gay people knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to protect themselves about </v>

3738
02:27:17.141 --> 02:27:17.974
<v Speaker 2>threats at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is now dangerous to be a gay </v>

3739
02:27:19.511 --> 02:27:20.980
<v Speaker 2>person in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3740
02:27:21.100 --> 02:27:23.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not fucking memories pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Muslims,</v>

3741
02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:24.473
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deny people the ability to educate </v>

3742
02:27:25.721 --> 02:27:28.300
<v Speaker 2>themselves on that is unacceptable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscionable.</v>

3743
02:27:28.301 --> 02:27:32.290
<v Speaker 2>An unforgivable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm doing two things.</v>

3744
02:27:32.291 --> 02:27:33.124
<v Speaker 2>One of them is we're going to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot back party at the Republican </v>

3745
02:27:34.990 --> 02:27:35.830
<v Speaker 2>National Convention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm going to show up to,</v>

3746
02:27:35.831 --> 02:27:37.150
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just get,</v>

3747
02:27:37.151 --> 02:27:38.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the gays.</v>

3748
02:27:38.410 --> 02:27:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other is back policy.</v>

3749
02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:42.300
<v Speaker 2>The policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the [inaudible].</v>

3750
02:27:42.430 --> 02:27:43.930
<v Speaker 2>There's little party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Republican National Convention,</v>

3751
02:27:43.931 --> 02:27:44.380
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3752
02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:45.213
<v Speaker 2>reminding gay people that the best way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can protect themselves is not </v>

3753
02:27:46.810 --> 02:27:47.643
<v Speaker 2>pander to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not the NRA going to open its doors </v>

3754
02:27:49.781 --> 02:27:50.614
<v Speaker 2>to gay people.</v>

3755
02:27:50.830 --> 02:27:53.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any reason why the NRA is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not already.</v>

3756
02:27:53.910 --> 02:27:56.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just take them all in all then yeah.</v>

3757
02:27:56.270 --> 02:27:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Might be a good thing at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary is losing a,</v>

3758
02:27:59.031 --> 02:28:01.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the NRA is worrying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worrying about membership.</v>

3759
02:28:01.181 --> 02:28:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I think their membership grows every </v>
<v Speaker 2>time as well as catastrophes,</v>

3760
02:28:03.671 --> 02:28:05.110
<v Speaker 2>because every time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time,</v>

3761
02:28:05.111 --> 02:28:05.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

3762
02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:07.300
<v Speaker 2>there's some other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3763
02:28:07.301 --> 02:28:08.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm guessing,</v>

3764
02:28:08.570 --> 02:28:09.403
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the energy at the NRA is </v>

3765
02:28:10.151 --> 02:28:12.730
<v Speaker 2>probably quite healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite healthy and membership growth.</v>

3766
02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:13.593
<v Speaker 2>It's quite healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But really the people who benefit are </v>

3767
02:28:14.861 --> 02:28:16.870
<v Speaker 2>the arms manufacturers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good,</v>

3768
02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:20.380
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want lots of market competition in the</v>

3769
02:28:20.381 --> 02:28:22.130
<v Speaker 2>arms trade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want cheap,</v>

3770
02:28:22.430 --> 02:28:25.310
<v Speaker 2>reliable firearm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every home has got 12 of them.</v>

3771
02:28:25.370 --> 02:28:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your country,</v>

3772
02:28:26.271 --> 02:28:28.070
<v Speaker 2>you're not even allowed to have them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3773
02:28:28.090 --> 02:28:28.923
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not allowed a pistol in my own </v>

3774
02:28:29.541 --> 02:28:30.590
<v Speaker 2>country to protect myself.</v>

3775
02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:32.400
<v Speaker 2>Despite the fact that government is </v>
<v Speaker 2>letting you know,</v>

3776
02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:34.460
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of people who want</v>
<v Speaker 2>me dead.</v>

3777
02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:37.610
<v Speaker 2>And this is not just me being a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>right wing lunatic.</v>

3778
02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although Ammo,</v>

3779
02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:39.890
<v Speaker 2>all of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

3780
02:28:40.060 --> 02:28:40.893
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a Gallup poll a couple of years </v>

3781
02:28:43.130 --> 02:28:45.080
<v Speaker 2>ago polled 1,001</v>
<v Speaker 2>British Muslims,</v>

3782
02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:47.780
<v Speaker 2>100% of them said to homosexuality was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3783
02:28:47.781 --> 02:28:50.170
<v Speaker 2>it was unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a later of percent,</v>

3784
02:28:50.210 --> 02:28:52.670
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent that's higher than </v>
<v Speaker 2>Palestine.</v>

3785
02:28:52.671 --> 02:28:53.504
<v Speaker 2>When 96% of people in the pew global </v>
<v Speaker 2>data say that homosexuality is </v>

3786
02:28:56.961 --> 02:29:01.670
<v Speaker 2>unacceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100% and 52% of those people weren't gay</v>

3787
02:29:01.671 --> 02:29:03.950
<v Speaker 2>sex made illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not crazy.</v>

3788
02:29:03.951 --> 02:29:04.784
<v Speaker 2>Muslims in Racker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is people two streets away from </v>

3789
02:29:06.351 --> 02:29:09.080
<v Speaker 2>where I live or even one street away or </v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the same building.</v>

3790
02:29:09.081 --> 02:29:11.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all think I'm unacceptable.</v>

3791
02:29:11.870 --> 02:29:16.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't want this in the west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get rid of it and lack of mode.</v>

3792
02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:18.553
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go out and I'm not </v>

3793
02:29:18.891 --> 02:29:19.724
<v Speaker 2>going to go out.</v>

3794
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:21.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go out and shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But somebody in a fucking like,</v>

3795
02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:23.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody comes dressed in,</v>

3796
02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:24.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flowing white white clothes with a beer </v>

3797
02:29:26.121 --> 02:29:28.010
<v Speaker 2>called Mohammed knocks at my front door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks aggressive.</v>

3798
02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm putting my hand on my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my hip,</v>

3799
02:29:29.901 --> 02:29:31.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and making sure that I'm not in danger.</v>

3800
02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn right.</v>

3801
02:29:32.901 --> 02:29:34.100
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3802
02:29:34.130 --> 02:29:35.850
<v Speaker 2>but you can't do that in your country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3803
02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:36.551
<v Speaker 2>why do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3804
02:29:36.551 --> 02:29:37.580
<v Speaker 2>is that where you're going to come over </v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

3805
02:29:38.070 --> 02:29:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Can you move here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3806
02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:42.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see you seem to fit the profile.</v>

3807
02:29:43.130 --> 02:29:45.720
<v Speaker 2>You make good money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're expected.</v>

3808
02:29:45.740 --> 02:29:49.520
<v Speaker 2>You have a great job in a Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't complication,</v>

3809
02:29:49.550 --> 02:29:51.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'd have a problem getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>a events.</v>

3810
02:29:51.620 --> 02:29:52.830
<v Speaker 2>So pretty easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3811
02:29:52.840 --> 02:29:54.080
<v Speaker 2>But a green card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3812
02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:56.960
<v Speaker 2>just learn a bunch of goofy shit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>our country that we don't remember.</v>

3813
02:29:57.200 --> 02:29:58.033
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to get married first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to some people that have </v>

3814
02:29:59.361 --> 02:30:00.194
<v Speaker 2>learned a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>become Canadians that have come over </v>

3815
02:30:00.891 --> 02:30:03.740
<v Speaker 2>here and gotten their green cards and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they know a lot more about this is,</v>

3816
02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:04.993
<v Speaker 2>this is the best country in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it would give me nothing but </v>

3817
02:30:07.521 --> 02:30:09.970
<v Speaker 2>pleasure to see what I'm saying.</v>

3818
02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:15.400
<v Speaker 2>Nothing but pleasure to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3819
02:30:15.450 --> 02:30:16.370
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come and live here.</v>

3820
02:30:16.371 --> 02:30:16.941
<v Speaker 2>So we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

3821
02:30:16.941 --> 02:30:18.320
<v Speaker 2>I'll keep you posted on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3822
02:30:18.450 --> 02:30:19.410
<v Speaker 2>some do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3823
02:30:19.430 --> 02:30:19.791
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3824
02:30:19.791 --> 02:30:20.624
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the left is not going to be honest </v>

3825
02:30:22.280 --> 02:30:23.960
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3826
02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:27.040
<v Speaker 2>the risks to gaze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to educate ourselves.</v>

3827
02:30:27.041 --> 02:30:29.450
<v Speaker 2>Stop listening to dumb as pictured </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrities.</v>

3828
02:30:29.451 --> 02:30:30.284
<v Speaker 2>Stop listening to politicize reporters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped listening to the governments </v>

3829
02:30:32.031 --> 02:30:34.790
<v Speaker 2>that listen to Obama and Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like trump,</v>

3830
02:30:34.791 --> 02:30:35.624
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the only his speech after Orlando </v>

3831
02:30:37.430 --> 02:30:39.890
<v Speaker 2>magnificent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most pro.</v>

3832
02:30:40.040 --> 02:30:40.731
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just saying,</v>

3833
02:30:40.731 --> 02:30:41.270
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

3834
02:30:41.270 --> 02:30:44.090
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem for the gay community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We cannot allow this stuff to come in.</v>

3835
02:30:44.091 --> 02:30:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to protect you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3836
02:30:45.470 --> 02:30:45.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to,</v>

3837
02:30:45.951 --> 02:30:47.010
<v Speaker 2>you need to arm yourself and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3838
02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:47.271
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

3839
02:30:47.271 --> 02:30:48.650
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to read a speech.</v>

3840
02:30:48.651 --> 02:30:50.420
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's a lot more complex and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuanced than that.</v>

3841
02:30:50.720 --> 02:30:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Then that suggests genuinely great </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>

3842
02:30:54.140 --> 02:30:56.270
<v Speaker 2>which suggests to me that Obama might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like a,</v>

3843
02:30:56.271 --> 02:30:58.370
<v Speaker 2>almost like a Cameroonian politician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

3844
02:30:58.371 --> 02:30:59.001
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the country,</v>

3845
02:30:59.001 --> 02:31:00.770
<v Speaker 2>but I mean like David Cameron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3846
02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:02.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

3847
02:31:02.541 --> 02:31:03.351
<v Speaker 2>in the sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3848
02:31:03.351 --> 02:31:04.070
<v Speaker 2>he can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can,</v>

3849
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:06.890
<v Speaker 2>he can sort of falter now and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when the moment calls for it,</v>

3850
02:31:06.920 --> 02:31:08.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he rises to the occasion.</v>

3851
02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:09.470
<v Speaker 2>A Bush was like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3852
02:31:09.471 --> 02:31:10.304
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3853
02:31:10.390 --> 02:31:12.680
<v Speaker 2>w speech after nine 11 was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular.</v>

3854
02:31:13.130 --> 02:31:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

3855
02:31:14.001 --> 02:31:14.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>

3856
02:31:14.481 --> 02:31:15.740
<v Speaker 2>trump has very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strong,</v>

3857
02:31:15.741 --> 02:31:16.574
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think trumps the most pro gay </v>

3858
02:31:17.001 --> 02:31:19.740
<v Speaker 2>candidate in American electoral history </v>
<v Speaker 2>on either side of the divide,</v>

3859
02:31:19.741 --> 02:31:20.970
<v Speaker 2>frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

3860
02:31:21.210 --> 02:31:22.910
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gave,</v>

3861
02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:24.330
<v Speaker 2>people need to take this into their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands,</v>

3862
02:31:24.390 --> 02:31:25.950
<v Speaker 2>frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3863
02:31:25.970 --> 02:31:26.803
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to Sweden where a year ago </v>

3864
02:31:30.390 --> 02:31:32.270
<v Speaker 2>the Swedish authorities say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3865
02:31:32.340 --> 02:31:33.173
<v Speaker 2>told a gay pride march that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>needlessly provocative for walking </v>

3866
02:31:35.881 --> 02:31:37.170
<v Speaker 2>through a Muslim area of Stockholm.</v>

3867
02:31:37.650 --> 02:31:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3868
02:31:38.940 --> 02:31:40.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really needlessly,</v>

3869
02:31:40.480 --> 02:31:42.720
<v Speaker 2>needlessly provocative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is gay pride,</v>

3870
02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:44.850
<v Speaker 2>how much gay stuff goes on in the Muslim</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

3871
02:31:44.851 --> 02:31:47.440
<v Speaker 2>because isn't that a big issue as well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3872
02:31:47.960 --> 02:31:49.980
<v Speaker 2>because of the suppression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3873
02:31:50.070 --> 02:31:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

3874
02:31:51.331 --> 02:31:52.890
<v Speaker 2>we should get onto that because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

3875
02:31:53.070 --> 02:31:54.210
<v Speaker 2>So I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna,</v>

3876
02:31:54.360 --> 02:31:55.193
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that my security guys are golden </v>

3877
02:31:58.531 --> 02:31:59.640
<v Speaker 2>pony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please say yes.</v>

3878
02:31:59.880 --> 02:32:01.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to ride a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3879
02:32:01.230 --> 02:32:03.810
<v Speaker 2>you are into the Muslim ride a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping so.</v>

3880
02:32:03.811 --> 02:32:04.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3881
02:32:04.590 --> 02:32:05.423
<v Speaker 2>the security people asking me not to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because they can't protect me if I'm </v>

3882
02:32:07.590 --> 02:32:08.670
<v Speaker 2>much higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3883
02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Because anybody could take me out from </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere,</v>

3884
02:32:10.321 --> 02:32:12.540
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping to persuade them to let me do</v>

3885
02:32:12.541 --> 02:32:13.374
<v Speaker 2>it and I want to ride in with like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want 20 people in a v shape with like </v>

3886
02:32:15.271 --> 02:32:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Milo banners behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like proper full game of thrones style.</v>

3887
02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to write this or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be of course,</v>

3888
02:32:21.570 --> 02:32:23.310
<v Speaker 2>which we'll take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll take all our people over.</v>

3889
02:32:23.311 --> 02:32:24.610
<v Speaker 2>We'll have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there'd be plenty of volunteers</v>

3890
02:32:24.611 --> 02:32:25.444
<v Speaker 2>and this March anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to be me on horseback </v>

3891
02:32:28.290 --> 02:32:29.123
<v Speaker 2>marching into the Muslim ghetto and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving a speech about Islam and gays in </v>

3892
02:32:32.191 --> 02:32:36.060
<v Speaker 2>the very hot of European cookery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country,</v>

3893
02:32:36.061 --> 02:32:36.894
<v Speaker 2>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has given itself over completely </v>

3894
02:32:38.821 --> 02:32:41.730
<v Speaker 2>to Islamic immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is now the rape capital of Europe.</v>

3895
02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Because the true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3896
02:32:43.350 --> 02:32:44.183
<v Speaker 2>the Rape Camp Malmo Malmo in Sweden is </v>
<v Speaker 2>now the rape capital of Europe because </v>

3897
02:32:47.941 --> 02:32:48.774
<v Speaker 2>of uncontrolled Muslim immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the police there have been </v>

3898
02:32:50.611 --> 02:32:53.610
<v Speaker 2>instructed not to record the ethnicity </v>
<v Speaker 2>or religion of a silent,</v>

3899
02:32:53.611 --> 02:32:54.444
<v Speaker 2>so they don't even ask to Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even have statistics on who </v>

3900
02:32:56.911 --> 02:32:59.730
<v Speaker 2>does it any more similar to the Loretta </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lynch Trent redacted transcript.</v>

3901
02:32:59.731 --> 02:33:01.530
<v Speaker 2>This is what people don't see color.</v>

3902
02:33:01.800 --> 02:33:03.480
<v Speaker 2>I just see people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3903
02:33:03.481 --> 02:33:05.610
<v Speaker 2>And men are rapists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause this is what the left does.</v>

3904
02:33:05.611 --> 02:33:06.444
<v Speaker 2>It's like you import a load of Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims start raping and stealing from </v>

3905
02:33:09.301 --> 02:33:12.810
<v Speaker 2>everybody and the responses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is toxic masculinity.</v>

3906
02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

3907
02:33:14.101 --> 02:33:16.680
<v Speaker 2>that's a hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that term.</v>

3908
02:33:16.740 --> 02:33:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to do about that?</v>

3909
02:33:19.650 --> 02:33:22.170
<v Speaker 2>What is swollen plan to do to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>mitigate some of the rape?</v>

3910
02:33:22.380 --> 02:33:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know what they've done?</v>

3911
02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:24.593
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you know,</v>

3912
02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:26.520
<v Speaker 2>you gave me a cue question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surely you did.</v>

3913
02:33:27.260 --> 02:33:28.800
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was a,</v>

3914
02:33:28.801 --> 02:33:30.830
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was a canny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenny.</v>

3915
02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3916
02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:32.970
<v Speaker 2>what do you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>T up?</v>

3917
02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3918
02:33:34.681 --> 02:33:38.820
<v Speaker 2>Sweden has issued women with wristbands </v>
<v Speaker 2>and these wristbands say don't rape.</v>

3919
02:33:39.630 --> 02:33:41.370
<v Speaker 2>That's Sweden's answer to the rape </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis.</v>

3920
02:33:43.610 --> 02:33:44.443
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden's to the rape crisis is an issue </v>

3921
02:33:47.060 --> 02:33:47.893
<v Speaker 2>with wristbands that say don't rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to forbid the police for mentioning </v>

3922
02:33:51.151 --> 02:33:54.390
<v Speaker 2>the ethnicity and religion of a silence </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Sweden's answer the rape crisis,</v>

3923
02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:58.980
<v Speaker 2>I can't fix that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Milo's answer to the rape crisis and</v>

3924
02:33:58.981 --> 02:34:01.380
<v Speaker 2>deport all the Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deport them,</v>

3925
02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:02.273
<v Speaker 2>get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has anybody else suggested that anyone </v>

3926
02:34:04.691 --> 02:34:07.140
<v Speaker 2>in their countries or any debate about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to handle this?</v>

3927
02:34:07.160 --> 02:34:08.310
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they doing?</v>

3928
02:34:08.311 --> 02:34:09.450
<v Speaker 2>They're just sticking their head in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sand.</v>

3929
02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3930
02:34:11.430 --> 02:34:12.263
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot fix the woman problem single </v>

3931
02:34:13.610 --> 02:34:14.443
<v Speaker 2>handed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can perhaps embarrass the </v>

3932
02:34:15.541 --> 02:34:18.430
<v Speaker 2>government about the gay problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I certainly hope to do that.</v>

3933
02:34:18.431 --> 02:34:19.264
<v Speaker 2>So end of the month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have enjoyed any of my </v>

3934
02:34:21.700 --> 02:34:23.920
<v Speaker 2>programming or writing or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3935
02:34:23.921 --> 02:34:27.850
<v Speaker 2>enjoy the next three weeks because after</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 27th of July,</v>

3936
02:34:27.970 --> 02:34:28.803
<v Speaker 2>that could be it.</v>

3937
02:34:29.830 --> 02:34:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a ballsy move,</v>

3938
02:34:31.301 --> 02:34:33.490
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To go to one of the most,</v>

3939
02:34:33.491 --> 02:34:36.820
<v Speaker 2>probably I will say do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do it.</v>

3940
02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:37.713
<v Speaker 2>One of the most troubled areas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden and to walk through these </v>

3941
02:34:42.971 --> 02:34:44.060
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3942
02:34:44.200 --> 02:34:46.210
<v Speaker 2>these are obviously immigrant </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods,</v>

3943
02:34:46.211 --> 02:34:48.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are people that are Muslim cancer.</v>

3944
02:34:48.251 --> 02:34:49.084
<v Speaker 2>It's exclusively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did these people move into this </v>

3945
02:34:51.011 --> 02:34:52.570
<v Speaker 2>area?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did this start taking place?</v>

3946
02:34:52.590 --> 02:34:54.400
<v Speaker 2>I think over the last 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years,</v>

3947
02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Sweden's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ha ha,</v>

3948
02:34:55.610 --> 02:34:56.443
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has taken in hundreds of thousands of </v>

3949
02:34:57.551 --> 02:35:00.190
<v Speaker 2>them a year for the last 10 years I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

3950
02:35:00.370 --> 02:35:02.230
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't sound like a lot to an </v>
<v Speaker 2>American,</v>

3951
02:35:02.231 --> 02:35:04.060
<v Speaker 2>but Sweden doesn't have many people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3952
02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:04.953
<v Speaker 2>Like Sweden is not very populous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a couple of towns and that's </v>

3953
02:35:07.571 --> 02:35:12.010
<v Speaker 2>really the overall population of Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of million,</v>

3954
02:35:12.011 --> 02:35:12.844
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing like 4 million or </v>

3955
02:35:14.171 --> 02:35:15.130
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

3956
02:35:15.131 --> 02:35:16.180
<v Speaker 2>I think it might be less than that.</v>

3957
02:35:16.180 --> 02:35:17.013
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a fairly small geographic </v>

3958
02:35:18.971 --> 02:35:20.710
<v Speaker 2>area too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're on top of each.</v>

3959
02:35:20.711 --> 02:35:21.544
<v Speaker 2>Well does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a big stretch of it up </v>

3960
02:35:22.391 --> 02:35:24.760
<v Speaker 2>north where basically nobody lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like snow or something.</v>

3961
02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:27.960
<v Speaker 2>And then down there's like three or four</v>
<v Speaker 2>cities and yeah,</v>

3962
02:35:27.961 --> 02:35:28.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

3963
02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:29.860
<v Speaker 2>so two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>300,000</v>

3964
02:35:29.861 --> 02:35:32.290
<v Speaker 2>people a year is not to nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been to Stockholm.</v>

3965
02:35:32.291 --> 02:35:33.490
<v Speaker 2>It's gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

3966
02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:36.250
<v Speaker 2>But it won't be for long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be Al stock home soon.</v>

3967
02:35:36.610 --> 02:35:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll stock alice.</v>

3968
02:35:39.930 --> 02:35:40.763
<v Speaker 2>So the only thing is you used to hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abba and give it a couple of years and </v>

3969
02:35:44.381 --> 02:35:45.214
<v Speaker 2>all he will hear is,</v>

3970
02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:46.170
<v Speaker 8>oh Whoa,</v>

3971
02:35:47.130 --> 02:35:48.410
<v Speaker 2>what would they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Stockholm,</v>

3972
02:35:48.510 --> 02:35:50.940
<v Speaker 2>what would the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers for mass shootings.</v>

3973
02:35:51.140 --> 02:35:53.430
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was did you,</v>

3974
02:35:53.431 --> 02:35:54.264
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the definition of what someone is </v>

3975
02:35:56.961 --> 02:35:59.810
<v Speaker 2>using for what a mass shooting is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>varied.</v>

3976
02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:02.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in one place if it's,</v>

3977
02:36:02.510 --> 02:36:05.550
<v Speaker 2>which is where the questions are coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and uh,</v>

3978
02:36:06.050 --> 02:36:07.720
<v Speaker 2>they also don't count them if it's maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3979
02:36:07.721 --> 02:36:09.800
<v Speaker 2>a military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3980
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:11.540
<v Speaker 2>What are the other options are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the other,</v>

3981
02:36:11.541 --> 02:36:13.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>candidates for the number one,</v>

3982
02:36:14.590 --> 02:36:16.900
<v Speaker 2>this a massacre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of massacres.</v>

3983
02:36:16.930 --> 02:36:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Wounded knee massacre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3984
02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:20.230
<v Speaker 2>The Saint Louis massacre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3985
02:36:20.231 --> 02:36:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Those are the two ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3986
02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:22.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3987
02:36:22.721 --> 02:36:25.420
<v Speaker 2>The Saint Louis one in the a wounded </v>
<v Speaker 2>knee one were to,</v>

3988
02:36:25.421 --> 02:36:27.670
<v Speaker 2>I remembered other names of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

3989
02:36:27.671 --> 02:36:28.504
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

3990
02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3991
02:36:30.470 --> 02:36:31.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it depends on our definition,</v>

3992
02:36:31.811 --> 02:36:32.730
<v Speaker 2>but any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in many cases,</v>

3993
02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:34.640
<v Speaker 2>horrible tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3994
02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:35.673
<v Speaker 2>So I don't understand how sweet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks that they're just going to calm </v>

3995
02:36:38.741 --> 02:36:39.574
<v Speaker 2>the situation down by not mentioning the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender or the name of the assailant or </v>

3996
02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:45.580
<v Speaker 2>basically just can't say it was Muslims.</v>

3997
02:36:45.580 --> 02:36:46.430
<v Speaker 2>It did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3998
02:36:46.450 --> 02:36:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I bet everybody is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it does is it means they are now no</v>

3999
02:36:49.481 --> 02:36:50.314
<v Speaker 2>national statistics on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nobody can say 97% of the rapes are </v>

4000
02:36:53.891 --> 02:36:55.480
<v Speaker 2>committed by this portion of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

4001
02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Fix this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government's answer is not fixed the</v>

4002
02:36:58.901 --> 02:37:01.150
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but obscure the data.</v>

4003
02:37:01.420 --> 02:37:02.830
<v Speaker 2>They're going to ruin their whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

4004
02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:04.320
<v Speaker 2>They already have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was joe.</v>

4005
02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Malmo.</v>

4006
02:37:06.130 --> 02:37:07.900
<v Speaker 2>This was a feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Progressive Paradise.</v>

4007
02:37:08.050 --> 02:37:08.883
<v Speaker 2>Sweden was like a left wing paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden was one of the few countries </v>

4008
02:37:10.691 --> 02:37:12.640
<v Speaker 2>where leftwing politics worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4009
02:37:12.700 --> 02:37:14.890
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they as taxes for everything in Sweden.</v>

4010
02:37:14.891 --> 02:37:15.471
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

4011
02:37:15.471 --> 02:37:16.304
<v Speaker 2>I swear this is true because I have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Swedish friends told me that the TAC </v>

4012
02:37:18.261 --> 02:37:21.560
<v Speaker 2>like property taxes in Sweden depend on </v>
<v Speaker 2>like how nice your view is,</v>

4013
02:37:21.561 --> 02:37:22.940
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a nice ocean view,</v>

4014
02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:25.250
<v Speaker 2>they will charge you more like local </v>
<v Speaker 2>council tax.</v>

4015
02:37:25.250 --> 02:37:27.860
<v Speaker 2>I know what you call it in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you like the property tax?</v>

4016
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:28.783
<v Speaker 2>Is that property tax?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tax you pay to the city to like to </v>

4017
02:37:30.531 --> 02:37:32.060
<v Speaker 2>do the roads and stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

4018
02:37:32.061 --> 02:37:34.430
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's property tax that you have.</v>

4019
02:37:34.690 --> 02:37:36.770
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a lot of taxes over here anyway.</v>

4020
02:37:36.771 --> 02:37:38.600
<v Speaker 2>So one of these taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you have a nicer view,</v>

4021
02:37:38.690 --> 02:37:40.660
<v Speaker 2>they literally have so little to do in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden.</v>

4022
02:37:40.730 --> 02:37:41.563
<v Speaker 2>The government is just sitting around </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreaming up new taxes for things and </v>

4023
02:37:43.341 --> 02:37:45.200
<v Speaker 2>working out how they can charge people </v>
<v Speaker 2>more money for things.</v>

4024
02:37:45.201 --> 02:37:46.820
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4025
02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:49.070
<v Speaker 2>that's how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Appraisal fairly effective.</v>

4026
02:37:49.071 --> 02:37:50.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean the country was nice place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4027
02:37:50.540 --> 02:37:51.373
<v Speaker 2>what was the thought process between </v>
<v Speaker 2>letting all those people in there and </v>

4028
02:37:53.001 --> 02:37:53.834
<v Speaker 2>just open minded and just crazy left </v>
<v Speaker 2>wing lunatics who refuse to accept </v>

4029
02:37:59.001 --> 02:37:59.834
<v Speaker 2>reality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think they think that language </v>

4030
02:38:00.921 --> 02:38:01.550
<v Speaker 2>shapes reality.</v>

4031
02:38:01.550 --> 02:38:02.900
<v Speaker 2>They think if they call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4032
02:38:02.901 --> 02:38:03.734
<v Speaker 2>if they think if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they say lies often enough that it </v>

4033
02:38:05.601 --> 02:38:06.740
<v Speaker 2>becomes the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4034
02:38:06.741 --> 02:38:08.390
<v Speaker 2>which of course in some cases it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

4035
02:38:08.750 --> 02:38:09.171
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4036
02:38:09.171 --> 02:38:10.004
<v Speaker 2>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you say Muslims are peaceful often </v>

4037
02:38:10.551 --> 02:38:11.690
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does not seem to come through.</v>

4038
02:38:12.020 --> 02:38:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

4039
02:38:12.951 --> 02:38:14.110
<v Speaker 2>there are limits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are limits to this,</v>

4040
02:38:14.111 --> 02:38:15.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the power of positive thinking.</v>

4041
02:38:15.530 --> 02:38:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Is there anybody that thinks it's a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to have those people there?</v>

4042
02:38:18.461 --> 02:38:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there any arguments?</v>

4043
02:38:19.870 --> 02:38:24.870
<v Speaker 2>This is a positive sort of multicultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit to Sweden to think so.</v>

4044
02:38:25.610 --> 02:38:27.620
<v Speaker 2>I think Swedish people get it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't,</v>

4045
02:38:27.621 --> 02:38:29.510
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen any signs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4046
02:38:29.511 --> 02:38:31.670
<v Speaker 2>But only now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen any signs that the,</v>

4047
02:38:31.671 --> 02:38:33.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the government gets it.</v>

4048
02:38:33.470 --> 02:38:34.930
<v Speaker 2>And indeed in Sweden of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4049
02:38:34.931 --> 02:38:37.820
<v Speaker 2>it's very heavily socially enforced </v>
<v Speaker 2>consensus.</v>

4050
02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.730
<v Speaker 2>If you even mentioned immigration called</v>
<v Speaker 2>a racist and Sweden and you know,</v>

4051
02:38:40.731 --> 02:38:42.950
<v Speaker 2>there's no discussion of the papers </v>
<v Speaker 2>until very,</v>

4052
02:38:42.951 --> 02:38:44.250
<v Speaker 2>very recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4053
02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:46.760
<v Speaker 2>it's not on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People just don't.</v>

4054
02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:49.820
<v Speaker 2>So it asks about it bill out over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top before people start calling it.</v>

4055
02:38:49.821 --> 02:38:50.654
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically everyone needs to have a </v>

4056
02:38:52.041 --> 02:38:54.980
<v Speaker 2>daughter or a friend's daughter who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>raped before anything will happen.</v>

4057
02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Choose Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4058
02:38:57.870 --> 02:39:00.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so queasy Sweden.</v>

4059
02:39:00.951 --> 02:39:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then here's the big picture.</v>

4060
02:39:02.481 --> 02:39:03.314
<v Speaker 2>How do you take these people from these </v>
<v Speaker 2>places where they're coming over here </v>

4061
02:39:05.331 --> 02:39:07.640
<v Speaker 2>and doing these horrible things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you educate them?</v>

4062
02:39:07.641 --> 02:39:08.474
<v Speaker 2>How do you change that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you don't want to just share </v>

4063
02:39:09.610 --> 02:39:11.060
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want the how does anybody ever,</v>

4064
02:39:11.061 --> 02:39:12.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to engineer humanity,</v>

4065
02:39:13.970 --> 02:39:14.803
<v Speaker 2>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I care about keeping my family safe and </v>

4066
02:39:16.161 --> 02:39:16.994
<v Speaker 2>keeping my culture in tact and I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>them deported or I care about those </v>

4067
02:39:19.911 --> 02:39:23.330
<v Speaker 2>things as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also think that as a civilization,</v>

4068
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:27.440
<v Speaker 2>we should look towards optimizing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the civilization.</v>

4069
02:39:28.340 --> 02:39:30.200
<v Speaker 2>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should invade their country's killed</v>

4070
02:39:30.201 --> 02:39:32.810
<v Speaker 2>our leaders and convert to Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As Ann Coulter said,</v>

4071
02:39:35.870 --> 02:39:38.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have a better solution?</v>

4072
02:39:39.050 --> 02:39:40.640
<v Speaker 2>That's suppression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to work.</v>

4073
02:39:40.641 --> 02:39:43.910
<v Speaker 2>They're going to secretly build up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to make a dirty bomb.</v>

4074
02:39:43.980 --> 02:39:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Does come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq has been neutralized as a threat to</v>

4075
02:39:48.351 --> 02:39:50.660
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking mess either fighting over</v>

4076
02:39:50.661 --> 02:39:51.520
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shows,</v>

4077
02:39:52.250 --> 02:39:53.083
<v Speaker 2>they're not coming for us anytime soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The move wars everywhere to us anytime </v>

4078
02:39:56.661 --> 02:39:58.640
<v Speaker 2>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq has been neutralized as a threat.</v>

4079
02:39:58.880 --> 02:40:00.410
<v Speaker 2>That worked out pretty great from where </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting.</v>

4080
02:40:00.411 --> 02:40:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Well were weren't they like a fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat in the first place?</v>

4081
02:40:03.171 --> 02:40:08.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean the only reason why the it back </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause we armed him and supported him.</v>

4082
02:40:09.020 --> 02:40:09.853
<v Speaker 2>I in general think that America is one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the reasons America is cool is that </v>

4083
02:40:15.381 --> 02:40:16.214
<v Speaker 2>it is the only country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're sitting from outside America </v>

4084
02:40:17.451 --> 02:40:19.110
<v Speaker 2>is the only country that's got your </v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

4085
02:40:19.140 --> 02:40:20.940
<v Speaker 2>is the only country that will go and </v>
<v Speaker 2>help other people out.</v>

4086
02:40:20.970 --> 02:40:22.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of sweet like fucking things up.</v>

4087
02:40:23.230 --> 02:40:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty cool.</v>

4088
02:40:24.130 --> 02:40:25.650
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's how I ended the day.</v>

4089
02:40:26.310 --> 02:40:29.250
<v Speaker 2>There's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something to be said for that to</v>

4090
02:40:29.251 --> 02:40:31.740
<v Speaker 2>every like every country in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>likes to rag on America,</v>

4091
02:40:31.741 --> 02:40:33.240
<v Speaker 2>but where do they come when they need </v>
<v Speaker 2>help?</v>

4092
02:40:33.270 --> 02:40:35.250
<v Speaker 2>They come to America because they want </v>
<v Speaker 2>the boys,</v>

4093
02:40:35.251 --> 02:40:35.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want,</v>

4094
02:40:35.701 --> 02:40:37.260
<v Speaker 2>they want your boys to make it rain,</v>

4095
02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:38.273
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That massive amount of military moment </v>

4096
02:40:40.810 --> 02:40:45.580
<v Speaker 6>momentum and that military momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it supports a lot of people in this</v>

4097
02:40:45.581 --> 02:40:48.850
<v Speaker 6>country and it just supports a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>arms manufacturers,</v>

4098
02:40:48.851 --> 02:40:49.684
<v Speaker 6>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of industry involved in </v>

4099
02:40:51.791 --> 02:40:52.624
<v Speaker 6>the military and so we spread out and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the way to keep that military mode </v>

4100
02:40:56.410 --> 02:40:57.243
<v Speaker 6>moving and the way to keep it </v>
<v Speaker 6>operational is you have to have it all </v>

4101
02:40:59.471 --> 02:41:00.304
<v Speaker 6>over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we're in every fucking corner of the </v>

4102
02:41:02.651 --> 02:41:03.370
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>

4103
02:41:03.370 --> 02:41:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad to America is,</v>

4104
02:41:05.201 --> 02:41:06.034
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I want people to </v>

4105
02:41:06.611 --> 02:41:07.444
<v Speaker 2>remember in this election and remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>just generally in life is America's </v>

4106
02:41:10.331 --> 02:41:13.390
<v Speaker 2>fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>America is wonderful,</v>

4107
02:41:13.540 --> 02:41:14.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not perfect.</v>

4108
02:41:14.950 --> 02:41:16.990
<v Speaker 2>There are all sorts of things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody would like to change about it.</v>

4109
02:41:16.991 --> 02:41:19.230
<v Speaker 2>And the business of improving on America</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

4110
02:41:19.231 --> 02:41:22.180
<v Speaker 2>is what politics is for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But America is pretty fucking great.</v>

4111
02:41:22.450 --> 02:41:24.580
<v Speaker 2>And speaking of somebody who is not an </v>
<v Speaker 2>American,</v>

4112
02:41:24.910 --> 02:41:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I am so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad that America does have,</v>

4113
02:41:28.841 --> 02:41:30.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a finger everywhere in the world.</v>

4114
02:41:30.970 --> 02:41:33.670
<v Speaker 2>It makes us safer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes us more secure.</v>

4115
02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:37.000
<v Speaker 2>America's the only really powerful good </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy in the world.</v>

4116
02:41:37.001 --> 02:41:40.210
<v Speaker 2>And thank God for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God for you,</v>

4117
02:41:40.211 --> 02:41:43.720
<v Speaker 2>the state of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it weren't for America and you know,</v>

4118
02:41:44.110 --> 02:41:46.900
<v Speaker 2>it's a sort of brinkmanship like con </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

4119
02:41:46.901 --> 02:41:48.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if all the bad guys wants to act,</v>

4120
02:41:48.521 --> 02:41:50.020
<v Speaker 2>America couldn't fight them all off at </v>
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>

4121
02:41:50.021 --> 02:41:50.290
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

4122
02:41:50.290 --> 02:41:52.090
<v Speaker 2>So if they were smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would all just do what they want.</v>

4123
02:41:52.091 --> 02:41:53.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Russia would be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4126
02:41:55.750 --> 02:41:57.520
<v Speaker 2>like that in China.</v>

4127
02:41:57.521 --> 02:41:58.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could happen in America,</v>

4128
02:41:58.900 --> 02:42:00.450
<v Speaker 2>couldn't take them all on at once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

4129
02:42:00.451 --> 02:42:03.690
<v Speaker 2>the risk of going to war with America is</v>
<v Speaker 2>so great that the world doesn't,</v>

4130
02:42:03.710 --> 02:42:04.031

02:42:12.700 --> 02:42:13.533
<v Speaker 2>Il.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God that that super power is </v>

4136
02:42:14.651 --> 02:42:17.560
<v Speaker 2>America and not China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not Russia,</v>

4137
02:42:17.610 --> 02:42:19.840
<v Speaker 2>not Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>India.</v>

4138
02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:21.780
<v Speaker 2>And it calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could and it could be if,</v>

4139
02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:24.490
<v Speaker 2>if the left succeeds in destroying this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

4140
02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:26.590
<v Speaker 2>But don't you think that the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are on the left,</v>

4141
02:42:26.620 --> 02:42:29.140
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't believe that that's the case?</v>

4142
02:42:29.170 --> 02:42:30.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe,</v>

4143
02:42:30.190 --> 02:42:31.720
<v Speaker 2>they don't believe America is a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

4144
02:42:31.721 --> 02:42:33.190
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe it said was a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

4145
02:42:33.191 --> 02:42:34.024
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe there are global </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the children with no </v>

4146
02:42:37.811 --> 02:42:39.760
<v Speaker 2>understanding of geography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>history or anything else,</v>

4147
02:42:39.761 --> 02:42:42.820
<v Speaker 2>they don't appreciate how America keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world's safe.</v>

4148
02:42:43.030 --> 02:42:43.863
<v Speaker 2>And you can disagree with individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>military actions and many reasonable </v>

4149
02:42:47.291 --> 02:42:48.124
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I might even be persuaded into this </v>

4150
02:42:50.050 --> 02:42:51.280
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this position,</v>

4151
02:42:51.281 --> 02:42:53.080
<v Speaker 2>many reasonable people think </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan,</v>

4152
02:42:53.081 --> 02:42:54.910
<v Speaker 2>Iraq and all of the recent wars are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster.</v>

4153
02:42:54.911 --> 02:42:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Why going to Vietnam?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4154
02:42:56.650 --> 02:42:57.483
<v Speaker 2>Perfectly reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>respectable points of view that I do </v>

4155
02:42:58.931 --> 02:42:59.764
<v Speaker 2>respect and I enjoy discussing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people cause I like finding out about </v>

4156
02:43:02.051 --> 02:43:03.820
<v Speaker 2>these things that I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything about right.</v>

4157
02:43:04.420 --> 02:43:05.253
<v Speaker 2>Love to have the discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very important that America reflects on </v>

4158
02:43:07.481 --> 02:43:09.340
<v Speaker 2>what it's done before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So x better in the future.</v>

4159
02:43:10.300 --> 02:43:14.440
<v Speaker 2>But to say that it's to suggest that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world isn't a better place for America's</v>

4160
02:43:14.441 --> 02:43:14.860
<v Speaker 2>presence.</v>

4161
02:43:14.860 --> 02:43:17.920
<v Speaker 2>And preeminence is absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4162
02:43:17.950 --> 02:43:20.520
<v Speaker 2>in this stage of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're looking at the alternative,</v>

4163
02:43:20.890 --> 02:43:24.220
<v Speaker 2>the alternative being Putin being China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4164
02:43:24.221 --> 02:43:25.054
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do have some legitimate dictators </v>

4165
02:43:27.070 --> 02:43:29.650
<v Speaker 2>that are out there in the world that </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed their adversaries.</v>

4166
02:43:29.770 --> 02:43:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Putin is,</v>

4167
02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:36.550
<v Speaker 2>he is the most gangster of gangsters </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to a public leader,</v>

4168
02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:39.100
<v Speaker 2>like a guy who is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4169
02:43:39.101 --> 02:43:42.820
<v Speaker 2>there's no shadow dealings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's killing people in broad daylight.</v>

4170
02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4171
02:43:43.901 --> 02:43:46.240
<v Speaker 2>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think about that as,</v>

4172
02:43:46.241 --> 02:43:47.680
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we came back what we said earlier about,</v>

4173
02:43:47.710 --> 02:43:50.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America's values and this was it.</v>

4174
02:43:50.650 --> 02:43:52.030
<v Speaker 2>Margaret Thatcher used to say this to </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

4175
02:43:52.031 --> 02:43:54.790
<v Speaker 2>not founded on nationality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it founded on principle.</v>

4176
02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4177
02:43:56.800 --> 02:43:57.633
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's true and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans are quite keenly aware of </v>

4178
02:44:01.001 --> 02:44:01.834
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why they care about the first and </v>

4179
02:44:02.951 --> 02:44:03.784
<v Speaker 2>second amendments and some of the others</v>
<v Speaker 2>and why they care about freedom of </v>

4180
02:44:06.191 --> 02:44:07.910
<v Speaker 2>speech and liberty and prosperity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4181
02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:09.010
<v Speaker 2>freedom and property rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

4182
02:44:09.011 --> 02:44:09.844
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of stuff.</v>

4183
02:44:10.270 --> 02:44:10.761
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4184
02:44:10.761 --> 02:44:11.381
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4185
02:44:11.381 --> 02:44:13.390
<v Speaker 2>obviously the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the capitalism that has made all of that</v>

4186
02:44:13.391 --> 02:44:14.224
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has created a country in which </v>

4187
02:44:16.631 --> 02:44:19.540
<v Speaker 2>pretty much anyone can do pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything now.</v>

4188
02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:23.200
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

4189
02:44:23.201 --> 02:44:27.100
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are so inclined and so insane,</v>

4190
02:44:27.970 --> 02:44:30.490
<v Speaker 2>get other people to pay to turn you into</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman if you want to.</v>

4191
02:44:30.970 --> 02:44:33.430
<v Speaker 2>That's how tolerant and permissive </v>
<v Speaker 2>American society is,</v>

4192
02:44:33.700 --> 02:44:34.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I might think paying for that </v>

4193
02:44:36.100 --> 02:44:39.010
<v Speaker 2>insurance companies are paying for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what's going on in America?</v>

4194
02:44:39.011 --> 02:44:40.150
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4195
02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:43.480
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole that's what tends to be,</v>

4196
02:44:43.481 --> 02:44:45.640
<v Speaker 2>cause there'll Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if a girl identifies with a man,</v>

4197
02:44:45.940 --> 02:44:47.440
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can change her.</v>

4198
02:44:47.590 --> 02:44:50.590
<v Speaker 2>I know in well they very rarely pay for </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

4199
02:44:50.591 --> 02:44:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a mixture of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4200
02:44:52.480 --> 02:44:56.440
<v Speaker 2>of insurance companies and Medicare and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Medicaid because there were poor because</v>

4201
02:44:56.441 --> 02:44:57.580
<v Speaker 2>they're all poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4202
02:44:57.910 --> 02:45:01.450
<v Speaker 2>transsexuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender folk as the left wants us to</v>

4203
02:45:01.451 --> 02:45:02.550
<v Speaker 2>call them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4204
02:45:02.590 --> 02:45:03.423
<v Speaker 2>are vastly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disproportionately a socioeconomically </v>

4205
02:45:05.891 --> 02:45:06.610
<v Speaker 2>underprivileged.</v>

4206
02:45:06.610 --> 02:45:08.320
<v Speaker 2>What about Bruce Jenner?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rich as fuck.</v>

4207
02:45:08.350 --> 02:45:09.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>

4208
02:45:09.001 --> 02:45:10.300
<v Speaker 2>he's an outlier most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

4209
02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:13.390
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most transgender people.</v>

4210
02:45:13.540 --> 02:45:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like a rebel to be.</v>

4211
02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's not,</v>

4212
02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:17.800
<v Speaker 2>he's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not that cool,</v>

4213
02:45:18.250 --> 02:45:21.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leather straps to be strictly accurate.</v>

4214
02:45:21.341 --> 02:45:25.030
<v Speaker 2>All you can say is that transgender </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are disproportionately poor and,</v>

4215
02:45:25.180 --> 02:45:27.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socioeconomically underprivileged.</v>

4216
02:45:27.221 --> 02:45:28.054
<v Speaker 2>They come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come from low orders and tend to </v>

4217
02:45:29.981 --> 02:45:31.540
<v Speaker 2>have much in their bank account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

4218
02:45:31.550 --> 02:45:31.950
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4219
02:45:31.950 --> 02:45:33.310
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a mixture of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4220
02:45:33.370 --> 02:45:36.760
<v Speaker 2>insurance companies like health stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have here,</v>

4221
02:45:36.761 --> 02:45:38.650
<v Speaker 2>which always miss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so confusing to me.</v>

4222
02:45:38.860 --> 02:45:40.660
<v Speaker 2>These weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>complex things you have,</v>

4223
02:45:40.661 --> 02:45:42.730
<v Speaker 2>just get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4224
02:45:42.731 --> 02:45:43.564
<v Speaker 2>you don't want this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this creeping national health service </v>

4225
02:45:45.461 --> 02:45:46.430
<v Speaker 2>you seem to have here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4226
02:45:46.590 --> 02:45:47.423
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4227
02:45:47.650 --> 02:45:48.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4228
02:45:48.530 --> 02:45:49.300
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4229
02:45:49.300 --> 02:45:50.133
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's completely taxpayer funded and </v>

4230
02:45:51.511 --> 02:45:52.780
<v Speaker 2>everywhere in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

4231
02:45:52.900 --> 02:45:55.210
<v Speaker 2>transgender operations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely taxpayer funded.</v>

4232
02:45:55.210 --> 02:45:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

4233
02:45:56.051 --> 02:45:56.884
<v Speaker 2>how do they determine whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's valuable or viable doctors do </v>

4234
02:45:59.651 --> 02:46:00.550
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just say,</v>

4235
02:46:00.551 --> 02:46:01.384
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy.</v>

4236
02:46:01.450 --> 02:46:02.283
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the doctors have a vested interest in </v>

4237
02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:05.860
<v Speaker 2>performing more of the surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

4238
02:46:05.861 --> 02:46:06.910
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

4239
02:46:06.911 --> 02:46:07.690
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

4240
02:46:07.690 --> 02:46:09.040
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4241
02:46:09.290 --> 02:46:11.870
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4242
02:46:11.871 --> 02:46:12.704
<v Speaker 2>if somebody is really insistent and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens more than you would think and </v>

4243
02:46:15.711 --> 02:46:16.544
<v Speaker 2>it's not reported on very often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to find someone to </v>

4244
02:46:18.891 --> 02:46:19.724
<v Speaker 2>go on record about this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you'll find that very often when </v>

4245
02:46:23.481 --> 02:46:25.830
<v Speaker 2>somebody wants to go in for the surgery </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the doctors know no,</v>

4246
02:46:25.850 --> 02:46:26.683
<v Speaker 2>they will start kicking up a fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might accuse the doctor of </v>

4247
02:46:29.811 --> 02:46:30.644
<v Speaker 2>transphobia asked for another doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People basically who people who want </v>

4248
02:46:33.591 --> 02:46:36.800
<v Speaker 2>this stuff or mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they act like mad people.</v>

4249
02:46:36.801 --> 02:46:37.634
<v Speaker 2>So they will go doctor shopping and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>will go round every doctor until </v>

4250
02:46:39.831 --> 02:46:41.480
<v Speaker 2>somebody says yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will acute,</v>

4251
02:46:41.481 --> 02:46:43.220
<v Speaker 2>they will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will like beg,</v>

<v Speaker 2>borrow and steal for money to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4253
02:46:44.961 --> 02:46:47.150
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do crazy stuff to themselves.</v>

4254
02:46:47.420 --> 02:46:52.420
<v Speaker 2>They will insist in and cry foul and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bully and yell at doctors until they get</v>

4255
02:46:52.851 --> 02:46:54.260
<v Speaker 2>what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4256
02:46:54.261 --> 02:46:57.140
<v Speaker 2>doctors are only humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the must just want an easy life.</v>

4257
02:46:57.170 --> 02:46:58.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody comes in and says,</v>

4258
02:46:58.461 --> 02:47:00.080
<v Speaker 2>I want to be a woman in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly unhinged.</v>

4259
02:47:00.081 --> 02:47:02.210
<v Speaker 2>At some point of Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number 17,</v>

4260
02:47:02.240 --> 02:47:03.380
<v Speaker 2>somebody is going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know what?</v>

<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

4266
02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:18.050
<v Speaker 6>I think you probably converted 17 or 18 </v>
<v Speaker 6>people to voting for trump.</v>

4267
02:47:18.170 --> 02:47:19.550
<v Speaker 6>That's all I ask.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's all.</v>

4268
02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:21.380
<v Speaker 6>I was 20 people a day and I would have </v>
<v Speaker 6>done my bit.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I think you probably get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's probably closing in on 20.</v>

4270
02:47:24.260 --> 02:47:25.910
<v Speaker 6>It's splendid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 6>but I think you had some very reasonable</v>

4277
02:47:38.571 --> 02:47:39.404
<v Speaker 6>points about what a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what an odd business that the whole </v>

4278
02:47:43.371 --> 02:47:46.250
<v Speaker 6>thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>America is in a weird place.</v>

4279
02:47:46.340 --> 02:47:50.870
<v Speaker 6>What's also the ideology that we are </v>
<v Speaker 6>being forced to accept.</v>

4280
02:47:50.871 --> 02:47:52.910
<v Speaker 6>And Kurt Metzger,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who was on the podcast,</v>

4281
02:47:53.300 --> 02:47:57.590
<v Speaker 6>very smart guy and a funny dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he grew up a Jehovah's witness.</v>

4282
02:47:57.591 --> 02:47:59.120

<v Speaker 6>Or a Moonie showboat.</v>

4283
02:47:59.130 --> 02:47:59.963
<v Speaker 6>Jehovah's Witness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He grew up in a call this a to dual </v>

4284
02:48:01.971 --> 02:48:02.470
<v Speaker 6>ones,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4286
02:48:04.010 --> 02:48:05.420
<v Speaker 6>couple of them go door door,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

4287
02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:08.230
<v Speaker 2>the Mormons do too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4288
02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:10.460
<v Speaker 6>I don't know that jeff has messages.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The famous,</v>

02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:12.420
<v Speaker 6>they have the cash town makes me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know that just yet.</v>

4290
02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:13.463
<v Speaker 6>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>point being he acquainted it correctly </v>

4291
02:48:16.770 --> 02:48:17.603
<v Speaker 6>to this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this sort of box thinking where you're </v>

4292
02:48:19.561 --> 02:48:21.990
<v Speaker 6>not allowed to think outside that box.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just like religion.</v>

4293
02:48:22.140 --> 02:48:24.090
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I understand this kind of thinking.</v>

4294
02:48:24.091 --> 02:48:26.790
<v Speaker 6>I grew up with this kind of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 6>like you can't make me think like this.</v>

4295
02:48:27.060 --> 02:48:30.540
<v Speaker 6>I know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like this is not rational or objective.</v>

4296
02:48:30.541 --> 02:48:34.050
<v Speaker 6>You're not talking about these things in</v>
<v Speaker 6>a fair way.</v>

4297
02:48:34.230 --> 02:48:35.063
<v Speaker 6>You have a very biased,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very predetermined pattern that you're </v>

4298
02:48:38.580 --> 02:48:41.340
<v Speaker 6>forcing people into subscribing to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if they don't,</v>

4299
02:48:41.610 --> 02:48:42.443
<v Speaker 6>then there's something wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're bigoted or assholes or they're </v>

4300
02:48:44.920 --> 02:48:47.430
<v Speaker 6>trans phobic or they tried to </v>
<v Speaker 6>pathologize.</v>

4301
02:48:47.431 --> 02:48:47.741
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

4302
02:48:47.741 --> 02:48:48.331
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it's me,</v>

4303
02:48:48.331 --> 02:48:51.630
<v Speaker 6>they call you was self-loathing gay men </v>
<v Speaker 6>or toxic male,</v>

4304
02:48:51.631 --> 02:48:53.310
<v Speaker 6>masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hate myself.</v>

4305
02:48:53.311 --> 02:48:55.710
<v Speaker 6>I just don't agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4306
02:48:55.740 --> 02:48:59.190
<v Speaker 6>it's a weird thing when you can't agree </v>
<v Speaker 6>or you can't disagree with someone.</v>

4307
02:48:59.490 --> 02:49:00.251
<v Speaker 6>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

4308
02:49:00.251 --> 02:49:04.070
<v Speaker 6>you're not allowed to debate it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The discussion is closed and this is a,</v>

4309
02:49:04.071 --> 02:49:06.600
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is not like as simple as is hot,</v>

4310
02:49:06.601 --> 02:49:08.250
<v Speaker 6>hot is cold,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cold,</v>

4311
02:49:08.490 --> 02:49:09.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his metal hard.</v>

4312
02:49:09.690 --> 02:49:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Now these are things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are complicated.</v>

4313
02:49:11.460 --> 02:49:12.293
<v Speaker 2>The etiology of homosexuality is complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nuanced and maybe different for </v>

4314
02:49:15.331 --> 02:49:16.164
<v Speaker 2>different people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The correct treatment pathway for </v>

4315
02:49:18.151 --> 02:49:18.984
<v Speaker 2>transgenderism is complex and nuanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>and may be different for different </v>

4316
02:49:21.571 --> 02:49:22.404
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left simply doesn't make space for </v>

4317
02:49:24.001 --> 02:49:25.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for how complex life really is.</v>

4318
02:49:26.130 --> 02:49:28.920
<v Speaker 2>They demand this sort of conformity from</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else.</v>

4319
02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:30.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're gay,</v>

4320
02:49:30.151 --> 02:49:33.120
<v Speaker 2>you can't be a Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must hate yourself and one of you is</v>

4321
02:49:33.121 --> 02:49:33.954
<v Speaker 2>in confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet they demand that we accept their </v>

4322
02:49:35.700 --> 02:49:37.290
<v Speaker 2>crazy self descriptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4323
02:49:37.291 --> 02:49:38.124
<v Speaker 2>I'm a gender Queer nonbinary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the height of hypocrisy and at </v>

4324
02:49:42.241 --> 02:49:43.350
<v Speaker 2>the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4325
02:49:43.370 --> 02:49:45.240
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they expect us to,</v>

4326
02:49:45.510 --> 02:49:48.180
<v Speaker 2>if not believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least publicly go along with lies,</v>

4327
02:49:48.420 --> 02:49:51.480
<v Speaker 2>lies that over simplify the complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>realities of life.</v>

4328
02:49:51.750 --> 02:49:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Now people are messy and imperfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are all on a not to get too,</v>

4329
02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:00.420
<v Speaker 2>you know what have a bucket veeder I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>

4330
02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't even have a vocabulary for </v>
<v Speaker 2>mysticism.</v>

4331
02:50:02.430 --> 02:50:02.941
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4332
02:50:02.941 --> 02:50:04.740
<v Speaker 2>not to get too happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo Woo.</v>

4333
02:50:04.770 --> 02:50:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to get too woo woo about it.</v>

4334
02:50:06.421 --> 02:50:07.890
<v Speaker 2>But we are all on a journey through </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

4335
02:50:07.891 --> 02:50:08.724
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing as you said at the beginning of </v>

4336
02:50:09.751 --> 02:50:10.980
<v Speaker 2>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolving,</v>

4337
02:50:10.981 --> 02:50:12.570
<v Speaker 2>becoming different people every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4338
02:50:12.571 --> 02:50:14.190
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every six months or even sooner.</v>

4339
02:50:14.580 --> 02:50:17.460
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is complicated.</v>

4340
02:50:17.461 --> 02:50:18.294
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that depresses me </v>
<v Speaker 2>as somebody who enjoys reading and </v>

4341
02:50:21.061 --> 02:50:21.894
<v Speaker 2>learning is the oversimplification of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life by the left into into okay people </v>

4342
02:50:27.810 --> 02:50:32.810
<v Speaker 2>and bigots and if you don't agree with </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific and very often insane points of</v>

4343
02:50:33.391 --> 02:50:34.224
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>points of view that contradict medical </v>

4344
02:50:35.131 --> 02:50:35.964
<v Speaker 2>science points you with a contradict </v>
<v Speaker 2>common sense points of view that at a </v>

4345
02:50:38.341 --> 02:50:42.480
<v Speaker 2>bare minimum are highly debatable if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not go along with this stuff,</v>

4346
02:50:42.540 --> 02:50:43.373
<v Speaker 2>this ever increasingly mad stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know this stuff that is his </v>

4347
02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:47.670
<v Speaker 2>wandering off into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into crazy territory.</v>

4348
02:50:48.110 --> 02:50:53.110
<v Speaker 2>You were in big land and the left has </v>
<v Speaker 2>excluded so many of us for so long,</v>

4349
02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:55.380
<v Speaker 2>gays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blacks,</v>

4350
02:50:55.410 --> 02:50:56.243
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>printed of blacks feel totally anti </v>

4351
02:50:57.150 --> 02:50:58.950
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine most of them in fact,</v>

4352
02:50:59.460 --> 02:51:00.600
<v Speaker 2>and these people are called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4353
02:51:00.601 --> 02:51:01.434
<v Speaker 2>Uncle Toms and all the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it happened on stage one of my </v>

4354
02:51:02.761 --> 02:51:05.400
<v Speaker 2>talks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't go along with all of this,</v>

4355
02:51:05.820 --> 02:51:08.070
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pathologized all the rest of it.</v>

4356
02:51:08.071 --> 02:51:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Well the left has created by doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outright me,</v>

4357
02:51:13.170 --> 02:51:17.370
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump and a whole army of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disaffected liberals,</v>

4358
02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:20.580
<v Speaker 2>it's own former supporters who are tired</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being told what they can think,</v>

4359
02:51:20.610 --> 02:51:21.540
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

4360
02:51:21.630 --> 02:51:22.830
<v Speaker 2>how they can dress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they can speak,</v>

4361
02:51:22.831 --> 02:51:23.880
<v Speaker 2>cause they can hang out with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4362
02:51:23.881 --> 02:51:24.714
<v Speaker 2>what belief systems they can have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it has alienated and entire young </v>

4363
02:51:27.751 --> 02:51:30.240
<v Speaker 2>generation from left wing politics.</v>

4364
02:51:30.450 --> 02:51:31.283
<v Speaker 2>And isn't it hilarious that it kind of </v>

4406
02:53:13.391 --> 02:53:16.570
<v Speaker 2>worlds when people looked out and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that you can beat them,</v>

4407
02:53:16.930 --> 02:53:19.990
<v Speaker 2>you can beat them if you don't give a </v>

<v Speaker 2>libertarianism and the right to do,</v>

4431
02:54:09.881 --> 02:54:10.714
<v Speaker 2>more plainly encouraged to contradict </v>
<v Speaker 2>people more often reminded that it is </v>

4432
02:54:15.311 --> 02:54:16.144
<v Speaker 2>not bigoted to have a different point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>view and that you are entitled to your </v>

4433
02:54:18.401 --> 02:54:21.460
<v Speaker 2>opinion no matter what it is and </v>
<v Speaker 2>entitled to say it without fear of being</v>
