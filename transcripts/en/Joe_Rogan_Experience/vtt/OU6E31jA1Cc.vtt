00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.430
Two one he ha.
Hello Anthony.

2
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:08.710
Jeselnik how are you sir?
Great,
Joe.
Good,
my buddy.
Uh,

3
00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:12.840
you a fully committed to the beard now.
Yeah.
I want to keep it as long as I can.

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.290
Are you going to go manage a man or you know,
as trim to trim a little.

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.090
I trim it a little bit.
Uh,

6
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:21.420
I just felt like the lady who cuts my hair trims it every like four weeks when I

7
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.790
go in for a haircut,
but I don't touch it at all.

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.560
I'm afraid if I tried to trim it I would just ruin it.
But I've love,

9
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.620
love having a beer.
Why do you love having a beard is like,

10
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.070
it's like sunglasses for the bottom half of your face.
You know what I mean?

11
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:39.360
Hide from the world kind of.
Yeah.
It chills me out a little more.

12
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.950
Yeah.
Especially on stage.
Like you're,

13
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.900
you're under the lights,
you know?
Uh,
and um,
I,

14
00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:50.640
my lip would start to get a little bit sweaty and I'm thinking about my lip and

15
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:54.210
I'm like,
should I wipe this?
Should I move it?
And then I started to sweat more.

16
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.180
But now that I have the beard and mustache,
my lip gets a little sweaty.

17
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:01.830
You can't tell so I don't get more anxious.
Uh,
interesting.
Yeah.

18
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.450
So you used to like think boy,
there's a little couple of beads.
Upper lip.
Yeah.

19
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:09.540
And I'm like,
can they see it?
Should I wipe?
Is it like,
is it too much?

20
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:12.960
If I'm wiping I drives me crazy.
You know,
it gets me boogers.

21
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.980
If I think I have a book,
like what is going on with my nose?
What is that?

22
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:19.320
Is that a booger shit?
Can they see that?
Oh,

23
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:22.820
I check for sure before I go on stage.
There's always a bigger check.
But I,

24
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.040
I'm so animated and I'm always yelling and screaming.

25
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.290
I'm always worried that something is like hanging off the tip of my nose.
Yeah.

26
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.640
And the people in the front row can't even enjoy it.
Like what the fuck man,

27
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:36.930
your nose,
Bro.
I've never had that.
I've had like definitely a fly down situation.

28
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.340
Oh yeah.
Never,
never like a booger.
That a ruined the show.

29
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.180
This is two things that people love to laugh at your fly down.

30
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.520
And if you put a beer down on the stage and the foam comes over the top,
I go,

31
00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:54.450
Oh my God,
your beers coming.
Ooh,
those are those things.

32
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.640
Right.
[inaudible] hi,
humor.
Yeah.
Hi.
Humor sweat.

33
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.110
Like,
like weird sweat stains like,
um,
when I've done specials,

34
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.620
but speaking,
which Anthony Jessalyn next new comedy special comes out tonight.

35
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:12.390
I hear.
Yup.
This evening.
Midnight.
I guess Netflix does it.
Excited.

36
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.960
Very excited.
Wow.
I've been seeing your sad.
It's fucking fantastic.
Thank you.

37
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:19.530
Thank.
I think this is the best I've ever done,
so I'm uh,
I'm pumped for it.

38
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:22.020
It's a beautiful thing about comedy,
man.
Keep working.

39
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.200
Keep paying attention to it.
You get better at it.
You don't really,
I mean,

40
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:28.790
Dom Maria and I had this conversation just a couple of months ago.
He looked Joe,

41
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:32.070
he goes,
I'm never been better.
He goes,
I'm fucking it.
A thousand years old.

42
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.280
It was,
I've never been better at comedy.
Yeah.
As long as you don't quit,

43
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.850
you don't,
you don't,
you don't ever get worse.
I don't think.
You don't,

44
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.870
as long as you don't give up because some guys don't quit.
But they give up.

45
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.170
Exactly.
Yeah.
They just go through the same material every single time.

46
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:47.610
You're like,
w w what are you doing here?

47
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.350
You're just trying to get out of the house.

48
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.700
You're not trying to get better as a little of that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

49
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:55.050
It's like if you're not right,

50
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.740
I guess that's the difference between also guys who put out specials or I say

51
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:04.060
women too or,
and people who don't.
Some people just don't put anything out.
Yeah,

52
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.200
no.
Yeah.
Once you put it out,
like I put it out because I'm like,
I'm,

53
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.900
I'm done with this.
Now it's getting boring.
It's not going to get better.

54
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.270
It's good as I can make it,
but because of that,

55
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:17.920
then I have to come up with a new hour specific schedule.
You like to fall too,

56
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.490
right?
If I'm correct,
I try.
I did it.
I did a year in La,

57
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:23.260
like at the store every night,
you know,

58
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:26.920
and like once a month I do Largo and try it all out at once.

59
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.190
And then a,
at the end of that year,
I had about 40 minutes,

60
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.370
went to clubs for a year,
every weekend for a year.

61
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.750
And then once that I had the hour after that,
then I did a year of theaters.

62
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.080
I mean at the end of that year I taped the special and,
and uh,

63
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.130
I was done with it.
So you're on like a three year plan?
Pretty much.
Yeah.

64
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.450
And that might change,
you know,
as I've gotten older,
uh,

65
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.510
the idea of a four year plan sounds a little bit nicer and you have other things

66
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:57.130
going on that,
uh,
that it's not as,
I'm not as worried.
Yeah,
yeah,

67
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.010
yeah.
Um,
I was trying,

68
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.160
I think two years seems to be right for me,

69
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:06.340
but it might be better to give it a little more time.
Right.

70
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:10.450
Just a little bit more time to tighten things up and Polish and you know,

71
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:15.430
add layers and act,
extra punch.
It's like you,
you know those guys,

72
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:17.560
like in when I started out in Boston,

73
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.800
there was guys that had been doing in the same set forever and there's pros and

74
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:23.650
cons to that and the pro is God damn.

75
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.150
They had that shit down tight where it was just punch line,
rapid punchline,

76
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.920
pause,
punchline.
They knew the,
the economy of words was perfect.

77
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.530
There was no fat,
no fat in the bits they had.

78
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.480
They had tightened all that stuff up.
Yeah.

79
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.930
My one of my biggest fears is like taping the special and then coming up with

80
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:46.240
like a great tag.
You know what I mean?
Like that.

81
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:50.710
I want it to be done when I shoot it because that feeling is awful.

82
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.780
It's the worst.
Done that.
Yeah.
So by sucks it sucks.

83
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.230
I W I once went back in my last special thoughts and prayers I ADR to line.

84
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.100
I like walked off stage and was like,
oh fuck,

85
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.400
I should use this word.
And I,

86
00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:11.200
it just occurred to me in the moment that I was using the wrong word.

87
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:15.850
So I went back and ADR you can obviously tell it's like me talking and then it's

88
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:20.080
like clearly a different voice,
a different voice.
Uh,
just one word but I had,

89
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.470
we'll do ADR stand for,
I know what it means but what does it stand for?

90
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.830
Jamie knows he's an actual audio guy.

91
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.870
Automated Dialogue Replacement and why it's automated is lost in my head
forever.

92
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:34.720
But that's what it means.
I wouldn't have guessed that in a million years.

93
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.130
I would've never,
I knew what it meant.
I've done ADR.
Yup.

94
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.550
I did it like fear factor.
Like every episode I had it do ADR.

95
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.290
It was the worst.
Why did you,

96
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.370
because you were just mispronouncing names or you it was usually because they

97
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:50.170
wanted a titan segments up.
Like you know,

98
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:54.880
we would film for three days and we'd have to slam that down to 44 minutes.

99
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.490
So sometimes you needed or sometimes

100
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.940
<v 1>they needed clarification for certain things.
Like,</v>

101
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.750
like we would explain the rules to them like very specifically and they would

102
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:07.910
have to read these rules and it took a long time.

103
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.970
But then like sometimes in the moment,

104
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.320
like on television you wouldn't explain it as clearly.
Like while we're filming,

105
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.290
like when would we had show them like this is what you have to do,

106
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:20.420
this is what you have to start here.
You go from here to there.

107
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.110
But sometimes when you would want to put it on TV,

108
00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:26.720
wanting to be more precise or more concise.
Yeah.

109
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.650
So I would every fucking week I to do ADR.
I hated it.

110
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.330
<v 0>You did.
It seems like it would be fun,</v>

111
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.640
like fear factor,
but just ADR seems like easy.
It's relaxed.

112
00:06:38.641 --> 00:06:40.260
You're just in the booth.
Yeah,
I was born.

113
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.000
<v 1>No,
no,
I didn't mind it.
Yeah.</v>

114
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.670
Now the fun thing about fear factor was when the checks came,

115
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.230
that was a fun thing.
And then when Nice people one,
that was fun too.
Yeah,
those,

116
00:06:49.231 --> 00:06:53.760
those things were fun.
But really that was,
that was a great job.

117
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.410
But it was a job.
It was like a job.
But like,
you know,
if he had a great like,

118
00:06:58.411 --> 00:06:59.820
yeah,
I really like working here.

119
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.550
Whereas you don't really say that about stand up.

120
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.670
<v 0>No,
I mean,
I don't think about it as a job.
It's just fucking fun.
It's awesome.
Oh,</v>

121
00:07:06.671 --> 00:07:10.860
absolutely.
Absolutely.
It's a get to do.
Yeah.
I get to do.
Yeah.

122
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.840
That's my new thing is like get to do versus have to do.

123
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.010
How long have you been doing it now?
Almost 17 years.
Wow.
Yeah.

124
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.740
Not Crazy to say.
It did,
is,

125
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.450
it blows me away like 17 years just seems like,

126
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.090
seems like forever.
And I'd had it my head that like 20.

127
00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:32.140
Was it an important number?
Like when you get to 20,
that means something.
And I,

128
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.800
I think I must have made that up that people say 10 years is a big deal,

129
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.430
but 20 doesn't seem to,
uh,
like I thought that was like,

130
00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:42.850
that's when you're really relaxed.
10 years seems like you're a pro.

131
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.200
When I see someone,
I'm like,
how long have you been doing it?
11 years.
All right.

132
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.080
I buy it.
And when someone says six years,
I'm like,
good luck.
You might quit.
Yeah.

133
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.350
I hate the people who were like,
I've been doing it for like 12 years.

134
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.840
When's the last time you got onstage?
Uh,
six months ago.
Oh No.

135
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.400
You started doing standup 12 years ago.
Uh,
you have not been doing it.
Yeah.

136
00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:05.620
You gotta go fuck yourself if you're not,

137
00:08:05.621 --> 00:08:08.920
if you take those people that take like giant chunks of time off and then come

138
00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:13.210
back,
you know,
and the want to go on the road with you like,
hey man.
Yeah.

139
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.090
It's like no,
that's not how this works.
You gotta be,

140
00:08:16.091 --> 00:08:19.040
you gotta be putting in the work yourself.
Otherwise,
why,
why,

141
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.370
why am I doing you a favor?
Yeah.
Well it's just,

142
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.460
it's one of those things like if you wanted to run a marathon,

143
00:08:24.461 --> 00:08:27.610
you have to run all the time or you're going to be really,

144
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.840
really sore and tired when it's over,
you know,

145
00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:33.520
and you're not going to really be able to do it.

146
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.220
You want to be able to actually do it and really run.

147
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.940
This is the same as stand up for whatever reason.

148
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.780
It seems so fucking easy when you're watching,

149
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.710
when you're watching someone do it.

150
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.070
See this is one of the reasons why everyone thinks they can do it,

151
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.600
cause it's just,
we're just talking.

152
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.140
It's not like we're doing Cirque de Solei up there and some people are like,
oh,

153
00:08:53.141 --> 00:08:55.120
that's not that funny.
I can be not that funny.

154
00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.450
Like it's not that it's not that big a deal.
Yeah.
You could.
Yeah,
maybe.
Yeah.

155
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.090
When you started out,
where'd you would sit?
Did you start in here?
Los Angeles?

156
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:07.640
Did you really where,
what was your first club?

157
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.540
<v 2>I,
uh,
my first ever show was at the belly room in the comedy store.</v>

158
00:09:11.541 --> 00:09:15.780
I took the class,
I took a class.
Uh,
Greg Dean,
uh,

159
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.940
I was working at borders books and music was my first job in La.
I remember that,

160
00:09:19.941 --> 00:09:22.400
play it like that big bookstore and I,
they,

161
00:09:22.401 --> 00:09:27.170
I just found the thinnest book on standup comedy that they had and bought that

162
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.330
and uh,
read it at the end.
It was like,

163
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:33.470
this guy teaches a class and send him Monica.
So you went and people were like,

164
00:09:33.471 --> 00:09:34.580
Oh,
surprise that I took a class.

165
00:09:34.581 --> 00:09:37.130
It's like the class didn't teach me how to be like this.

166
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.300
It just kind of gave me the courage to go to open mics and uh,
and,

167
00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:43.130
and I don't think it could have just gone to an open mic.

168
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.950
I was too scared for that.
I was like 23.
Uh,
but after the class,
you know,

169
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.900
I had a seven minutes set that I would go and go and do.

170
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.270
What did the class teach you?
Like how do they,
how do they start a class out?

171
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.660
There were two sessions.
It was like,

172
00:09:56.661 --> 00:09:59.810
it was like beginning and advanced and they would talk a little bit about joke

173
00:09:59.811 --> 00:10:00.644
structure.

174
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.950
They would talk about like simple things like taking the Mick out of the stand,

175
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:04.813
you know,
like,

176
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.730
but be careful cause some people walk up and they'd take the teeth out,

177
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.300
you know what I mean?
And like things like don't run the light show up early.

178
00:10:11.301 --> 00:10:15.170
Like things that were just,
um,
I may not have been common sense,
but it like,

179
00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:19.270
it gave me comfort to know the rules so that I could try to break them and you

180
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.090
know,

181
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:24.440
later on and then did a set at the belly room like with a bunch of other like

182
00:10:24.441 --> 00:10:27.560
people in the class who are all terrible.
None of them are doing standup anymore.

183
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.310
And I like killed.
Like I thought I killed,
I had to tape,

184
00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:34.880
I sent it out to everyone and one of the jokes from that first set I ended up

185
00:10:34.881 --> 00:10:37.850
using in the Donald Trump roast real.
So I was like,
Oh wow,

186
00:10:37.851 --> 00:10:41.390
maybe there's like some gold in there.
And I went back,
you know,

187
00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:45.410
10 years after I did it and watch the set again and had a panic attack watching

188
00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:49.480
myself.
What the way it was in my head was not what was on,
uh,

189
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.840
was not what was on screen.
It was,
it was bad.
Do you think

190
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:57.350
<v 0>just like psychological protectants that you throw up,
I mean,</v>

191
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.400
what is it that makes you think that you were better back in the day?

192
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.320
<v 2>I think it's exciting.
It's excitement,
right.
You know,
and just being stupid,</v>

193
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.320
you know,
like when people get into stand up later on in life,
I'm like,

194
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:13.630
I don't know if you can do this because you have to kind of be dumb enough to go

195
00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.430
through the things you have to do when you start out.

196
00:11:15.431 --> 00:11:19.270
But I'm glad I was 23 when I was running around to open mikes and uh,

197
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.180
and not knowing any better.
That's a really good point.
Yeah.

198
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.400
<v 0>Yeah.
I was 21 I was really dumb.
Yeah.</v>

199
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.660
Did you even just went right to an open mic or?
Well,
um,

200
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.160
I went to an open mic to watch first and that's what gave me the courage to go

201
00:11:33.161 --> 00:11:38.161
on stage because I had always thought like standup comedy was going to be Jerry

202
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.170
Seinfeld or Richard Pryor.
And if you go there,
like,
you know,

203
00:11:41.171 --> 00:11:44.140
and I had wrote a bunch of stuff and I had practiced a bunch of stuff into a

204
00:11:44.141 --> 00:11:48.910
tape recorder and it was terrible,
but I was trying to say it like a comedian.

205
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.630
But then when I went to an open mic and I realized how bad some of those people

206
00:11:52.631 --> 00:11:54.340
are,
I was like,
well,
I can be that

207
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.580
<v 1>bad.
I can do that.
I know I can pull off what they're doing.</v>

208
00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.291
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

209
00:11:58.291 --> 00:12:02.610
There's something about like performing for comedians that really angered me.

210
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.520
Like if I'm an audience wasn't laughing,
it was like,
all right,
whatever.

211
00:12:05.521 --> 00:12:08.640
The comedians,
it's like,
no,
you guys should get me.

212
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:13.140
Really ticked me off.
That I think didn't have any friends in the open mic.

213
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.230
A community that would laugh.
No,
I didn't have friends at all.
Like I would just,

214
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.200
I was just the guy who showed up and,

215
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.300
and did a set and we just get angrier and angrier.

216
00:12:21.301 --> 00:12:24.120
So I would like great because I was mad that they didn't,

217
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.060
they didn't get that I was funny,
you know?
And it was like,

218
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.730
it's my job to prove it to them and I was like,

219
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.380
these people should understand that I'm a,
that I'm funny.
Like,

220
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.050
because suddenly if a comedian that doesn't like me or doesn't like respect what

221
00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:41.100
I do,
I'm just like,
I can't believe you're comedian.
Like,
I really feel that way.

222
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.680
<v 1>That's a funny way of looking at it.
Well,</v>

223
00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:49.940
it's one of those things where you want to be good,
so bad.

224
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.310
You'll sort of convince yourself that you're good.

225
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.590
Are you convinced yourself that you're better than you are?

226
00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:59.450
Like I remember the feeling of being at an open mic night and not being sure

227
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:03.290
whether or not I was going to go on stage or not having a spot and watching

228
00:13:03.291 --> 00:13:05.450
these guys go,
God dammit,
I want to go up there.

229
00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:08.750
If I got up in front of that crowd right now,
I could kill you.

230
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.730
Just convince yourself that you were good.

231
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.820
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean I knew that my performance was bad.</v>

232
00:13:13.821 --> 00:13:17.030
I knew I was like funnier than what I was putting out there and that was what

233
00:13:17.031 --> 00:13:21.170
frustrated me.
It's like I've got to keep writing new jokes to get to,

234
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.140
to be able to prove myself to get to your potential.
Exactly.
Yeah.

235
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.950
<v 1>Yeah,
yeah.
That's,
uh,
it's a,</v>

236
00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:30.580
it's an interesting thing because it occurs in almost every thing that's

237
00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:35.020
difficult to do is like,
you see the path,
you're like,
okay,
I can just keep going.

238
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.060
Like martial arts for example,
it's a perfect,
perfect example.

239
00:13:38.061 --> 00:13:41.950
It's like you'll practice with a white belt and you kind of think like,
oh,

240
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:44.560
I kind of get this,
I'm going to get good at this,
I'm going to brew it.

241
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.200
And then you'll practice with someone who's really good,

242
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:51.220
who does it every day and is a black belt and you just feel helpless and you

243
00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:53.110
feel like,
God damn it,
I'll never get to that spot.

244
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.710
And that I used to feel like that about standing up.
There was a guy,

245
00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.710
when I first started out,
you probably never heard of him,

246
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:02.740
but he's one of the best comics of all time.
His name is Teddy Berge Ron.

247
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.720
And he was a Boston legend and he had a problem with substances to put it

248
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:11.010
mildly.
And um,
he was,

249
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:15.430
his timing was impeccable.
He went on the tonight show,
like back in the day,

250
00:14:15.431 --> 00:14:19.030
and he would play piano as well.
And,
uh,
he had like,

251
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.390
like the ultimate set on the tonight show.

252
00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:26.530
I mean just fucking murdered sat on the couch with Johnny,
I mean,

253
00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:30.280
and just was killing it and just super low.
And then went off the rails,

254
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:35.310
like the pressure of success and everything and his pills and booze and woo and

255
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:40.270
the whole thing.
But when I was an open mic or,
um,
one of the early,

256
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.710
early sets that I did,
I remember I did a set and then he went on,

257
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:45.851
you know,

258
00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:48.940
there was a bunch of old micros and then some professionals would hop on and do

259
00:14:48.941 --> 00:14:52.100
like five,
10 minutes.
And he went out and did that and he

260
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.930
<v 0>was so fucking good and so polished.
I almost quit.
I was like,
I was like,</v>

261
00:14:56.931 --> 00:15:00.860
what am I doing?
I'm terrible.
I don't have a point of view.
I don't,

262
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:03.470
I don't have perspective.
I don't have that kind of timing.

263
00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:06.190
I definitely don't have that kind of swagger.
Like he had a,

264
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:10.070
like a casual swagger,
you know,
on stage.
Did you have like an idol?

265
00:15:10.071 --> 00:15:14.600
Like somebody were trying to be as a standup?
Um,

266
00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.450
like he knows are probably a bunch of guys.
I sounded a lot like Richard,

267
00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:22.080
Jenny in the beginning I was kind of stealing,
like almost stealing his timing.

268
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.110
And then I realized that one time,

269
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.510
one time I was on stage and I heard myself sound like him and I was like,

270
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.880
alright,
I gotta fix this.
Yeah.
You know,
I did that with,

271
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.580
with David Tell in New York,

272
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.420
why would I did it till I would run downstairs and watch it tells set.

273
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.050
And then one day I caught myself not doing one of his bits,

274
00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:42.320
but like one of his mannerism kind of things.
Yeah.
It's just fun to do.

275
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.400
And I felt,
I was like,
I gotta stop this.
And I went and told SD,
uh,

276
00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:48.230
the woman who books the comedy cellar,
I was like,

277
00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:49.850
I got to stop watching David Towel.

278
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.700
And I said it like a confessional and I thought she was going to be like,

279
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.150
you're not a real comic.
Then everyone watches the talent.
She goes good,

280
00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.010
like more people should stop watching.

281
00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:02.260
David tells people were just ripping them off and I understand why,
but,
uh,

282
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:07.450
he's got such a bizarre sense of timing and then it's so infectious,

283
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:11.240
you know?
Oh yeah.
Just so,
so fun.
So fun to watch.

284
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.660
I've known Dave for like 28 years I think,

285
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:19.640
and he's always been like that.
He's always had that very strange way of talking.

286
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.070
Yeah.
You know?
Oh,
it's a box.

287
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.000
I've known him maybe 10 years and I don't know him at all.
You know what I mean?

288
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.210
We've like talked to a couple of times,
but I don't know anything about the guy.

289
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.100
And I think I met him after he had quit drinking,
so I think it was a different,

290
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:39.080
oh yeah.
I knew him in the heart when he was on that show.

291
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:44.110
Insomniacs and he was getting blasted out of his gourd every night.

292
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.790
Every night he was going to these places and it was killing him.
Yeah.

293
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.750
And he stopped doing the show for that very reason because everywhere he would

294
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:55.070
go,
it would just be shots,
shots,
shots,
and uh,

295
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.270
and then he,

296
00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:00.470
one time I ran into him at the Improv and it was like one o'clock in the morning

297
00:17:00.471 --> 00:17:03.620
and I was headed home and he's like,
Hey,
is there an after party?
Where do we go?

298
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:08.440
I was like,
where do we go?
Like go home,
go to sleep.
Yeah.

299
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.750
And then the next time I saw him,
he was totally sober.

300
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:16.670
He's one of those guys though that got sober and didn't stop being hilarious.
No,

301
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:19.430
a lot of guys do.
Yeah.
Oh,

302
00:17:19.431 --> 00:17:22.820
he's sober up and then they become annoying and they want to talk about their

303
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:26.030
sobriety.
I cannot stand,

304
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.970
I can't stand recovering addicts.
They drug.
Yeah,
man.

305
00:17:31.971 --> 00:17:33.590
They're worse than people who just find yoga.

306
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.160
They just won't shut the fuck up about recovery.
Yeah.
I,
I'm a,

307
00:17:38.161 --> 00:17:40.070
I'm guilty of that with many things.

308
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.780
If I get into something and I can't shut the fuck up about it,
but I get it,

309
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.140
you know,
for them it's like this pivotal moment in their life.
We're all sudden,

310
00:17:48.141 --> 00:17:51.240
they have their shit together and they just want to talk about it all the time.

311
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.600
The thing that drives me nuts though is when they judge.
Yes.

312
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.940
And they always get a little judgey that I go,
you sure?

313
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.210
Like do you need that last drink?
And I'm like,
yeah,
I do.

314
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:04.530
And I can handle my shit.
So,
Hey,
I'm super sorry.
You got that fucked up gene.

315
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.610
Yeah,
yeah,
whatever.
You went too far with it.
But I've got it under control,

316
00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:13.620
like being a little buzzed and I'm luckily the drugs and the drinking that I do,

317
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:18.300
it's a,
you know,
I,
if I'm going to drink,
I drink high quality stuff,
uh,

318
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.520
smoke a little weed,
but the other drugs don't really do it for me.
Tiff,

319
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.230
you fucked with other drugs.
Do tried just about everything.
And it just like,

320
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.800
not for me.
Like I've done cocaine and the next day been like,
I just feel stupid.

321
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.680
Like I feel like everything that came out of my mouth last night was dumb.

322
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.910
I feel like hell,
uh,
I enjoy,
uh,
we'd chills me out a,

323
00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:39.300
I like beer and wine and,
and uh,
and vodka and whiskey.

324
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.890
I have not done a lot of things.
I've never done masculine or pot.
It's basically,

325
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:47.390
I think they're pretty much the same thing.
I've never done,
um,

326
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:51.770
coke and never done meth.
I've never done any real and fed amines.
I've,
I mean,

327
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.130
I've always been scared of those though,

328
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.430
because those are the ones that I've seen people like really lose their lives

329
00:18:56.431 --> 00:19:00.600
for.
Yes.
And I,
I don't mess with them.
Fed it means at all and I don't enjoy it.

330
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.590
Uh,
someone who grinds their teeth,
you know,
like that's,
that's awful.

331
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.850
And I found like with comedy,
you can't be funny on cocaine

332
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.090
at comics who do,

333
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:16.020
who do cocaine and our funding because I just find it to be like,
you're not,

334
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.760
I can't laugh at anything and I can't,
like,
I'm talking too fast.
My timing's off.

335
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.650
Uh,
and like,
I'm not thinking in a funny way that I've always been surprised.

336
00:19:24.651 --> 00:19:27.990
The comics who have coke problems.
Yeah.
Joey Diaz talked about that,

337
00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:31.950
cause Joey Diaz did coke for years,
but he doesn't,
he's never done coke and gone.

338
00:19:31.951 --> 00:19:35.430
I said,
she goes,
he goes,
every time I tried it I was fucking terrible.
He goes,

339
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.700
it takes away your soul,
your heart.
You've got no heart when you're up there.

340
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.600
Yeah.
I guess again,
I've never done it,

341
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.690
but what I get is just,

342
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:49.610
I get that whole speedy thing where you just like your,

343
00:19:49.611 --> 00:19:54.330
your sense of how people are perceiving you as distorted timing is distorted.

344
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:58.170
Yeah.
Like I don't even go on stage.
Hi,
I'm Matt.
I have a couple of beers.

345
00:19:58.171 --> 00:20:01.140
I don't want to be slurring.
I even smoked pot at all that day.

346
00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:05.010
It's a worst show for it.
Really?
Yeah.
I wonder why that is.
I think I'm just,

347
00:20:05.011 --> 00:20:06.890
I'm just in my own head.
You know,
it makes,

348
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.470
it makes me want to get through the set as opposed to being present and enjoying

349
00:20:10.471 --> 00:20:13.950
it.
Like I just want it to be over so I can go chill out.
You know?

350
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.590
That's interesting.
It's only on only with weed.

351
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.290
One of my favorite things to do and I would take us in the row with me.

352
00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:23.370
He's getting so high that they could barely talk and then put him on stage.

353
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.600
That's what I do.
The first,
the first two guys I would open for on the road,

354
00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:32.100
it was a Doug Benson and Brian Posehn,
Jesus Christ.
And they were like,

355
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.890
they wanted to smoke all day.
That I was like,

356
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.210
every time I was a feature act like little most every time I was a feature act,

357
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.370
I was terrible because I thought like,
I have to smoke,

358
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.590
I've have to spoke to these guys that they won't take me on the road,

359
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.950
but I'm like barely getting through this half hour and I'm terrible.

360
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.040
It's not a smart

361
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.850
<v 1>move for someone who's just getting going to be that high on sage.</v>

362
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:56.560
But one time I did,
I was,
uh,
I,
I really didn't smoke pot until I was 30,

363
00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:00.190
like really smoke pot.
But I did it a handful of times when I was younger.

364
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.090
And one time when I was like a 21,

365
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.200
I was living with my buddy Jimmy.
And,
uh,
him and his,

366
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.550
one of his friends came over and he had pot and we smoked some pot during the

367
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:12.551
day.

368
00:21:12.551 --> 00:21:16.420
I think we had a barbecue or something and then I had a gig like six hours later

369
00:21:16.421 --> 00:21:21.421
I was still high and I remember being on stage and my timing was excellent and I

370
00:21:23.591 --> 00:21:27.760
was so locked in and focused and I remember being terrified that I was going to

371
00:21:27.761 --> 00:21:31.930
be terrible.
Terrified,
but I really nailed it for whatever reason.

372
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.430
But then I never did it again and I was like,
fuck,
I got away with it,
you know?

373
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:41.490
And then I started smoking when I was 30 and it kind of changed my act.

374
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:47.020
Like it made my ag from like,
it made my act more introspective.

375
00:21:47.021 --> 00:21:50.700
I started talking about weird or subjects and more interesting I taught,

376
00:21:50.701 --> 00:21:53.290
I started talking about things that it was actually more interested in.

377
00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.970
<v 2>Did you start to write on stage more when you were high on stage?</v>

378
00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.100
<v 1>Yeah,
I kind of always have written on stage a little bit,
but mostly,
um,</v>

379
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.280
mostly like tangents.

380
00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:08.030
Like I'd go off on a weird branch if I knew how to get back to the river,
right.

381
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.020
I would take like a weird stream off to the right and then just as long as I

382
00:22:12.021 --> 00:22:15.230
knew how to get back to the river of whatever the fuck I was talking about,

383
00:22:15.231 --> 00:22:16.064
I'd be fine.

384
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.640
But when I'm high I'll just let go wandering through the woods like I'm not,

385
00:22:21.831 --> 00:22:23.880
I'm not even concerned about the river.
I'm like,
yeah,

386
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.650
you know there's the river of thought,
the pattern that you're following.

387
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.430
But when I'm high I'm like,
what?
But who the fuck wants that and the why?

388
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:32.840
Why would you be that person?

389
00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.930
And then I'll start thinking like I remember when I was a kid and then I'll just

390
00:22:35.931 --> 00:22:40.850
like add a nowhere,
have this idea and I'm hoping it's going to go somewhere.

391
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:46.730
And those moments I feel like they're like,
it's like

392
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.170
foraging for food.
Like occasionally you find it,

393
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.690
like if you go out looking for mushrooms,
you don't know where they are.

394
00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.490
You might find edible mushrooms.

395
00:22:55.491 --> 00:22:57.800
Hopefully you're going to find them and sometimes you won't.

396
00:22:57.801 --> 00:22:59.480
Sometimes you come home with an empty basket,

397
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.710
but sometimes you get him and the only way you find out is if you forage.

398
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.580
And that's kind of what it feels like when I'm high on stage.
It's like,
Ugh,
okay.

399
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.483
I guess Kona.

400
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:13.190
But then I'm also really worried that I'm going to be boring.

401
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.550
Like I want to be.
Uh,
uh,
no.
These people paid to see,

402
00:23:16.551 --> 00:23:18.620
I know I'm trying to develop material,

403
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:20.930
but I also know I'm entertaining these people in the present.

404
00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.950
So it's like a fine line.
Yeah.

405
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.650
<v 2>I don't have that confidence to waste the audience's time.</v>

406
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.320
Do you know what I mean?
Like I'll see Chris Rock,

407
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.730
Chris Rock's a friend of mine and he'll go up and just like with nothing and

408
00:23:32.731 --> 00:23:37.410
just sit there and very comfortably for 45 minutes and just,

409
00:23:37.411 --> 00:23:38.071
and just,

410
00:23:38.071 --> 00:23:41.610
and just kind of talk and look for things and has no problem with it whatsoever.

411
00:23:41.611 --> 00:23:46.070
And I let him,
he'll go,
what else?
What else?
And the like stare at the sky,
look

412
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.360
<v 0>at the ground.
I can't,
you know,
who was the master at that was Damon Wayans.</v>

413
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.003
Oh my God.

414
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:56.450
Who a lot of people have forgot a lot of people forgot was one of the FEC and

415
00:23:56.451 --> 00:23:58.310
still is one of the best comics ever.

416
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:03.260
Damon Damon was a god damn murderer in the nineties.
Oh,
I loved her coming up,

417
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.600
but I remember going to the hot cafe.
Uh,

418
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.150
they would do it like a show every Tuesday.

419
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:13.310
Then my friends would run and Daymond winds would always drop in and do an hour

420
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.750
and ruin the show.

421
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:19.010
Like he would have no material and he would just attack people in the crowd.

422
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.760
By the time he was offstage,
like the audience was furious like they were,

423
00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.670
they went crazy when he came out and then by the end they were just like,

424
00:24:25.671 --> 00:24:28.340
why is he doing this to us?
And we were like,
we were like,

425
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.830
oh fuck Damon Waynes this year.
It was so funny.

426
00:24:30.831 --> 00:24:34.220
Somebody like looked up to as a kid and like loved you.
Just like,
aw man,

427
00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:38.120
this asshole again.
Wow,
that's crazy.
I wonder why he was doing that.

428
00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.420
But I mean,

429
00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.380
I guess it was probably because he couldn't do it at the store anymore.
Yeah.

430
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.490
W how,
how many years ago was this?
God,
I mean,
the least,

431
00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:51.200
at least 10,
12,
13 years ago.
See,
that puts it.
That's,
that makes sense,
right?

432
00:24:51.201 --> 00:24:53.300
Because that's around 2005 yeah.

433
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.820
That's like probably he stopped going to the store.

434
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.030
The store probably tightened up the way they used to because they used to just

435
00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:03.770
let anybody just draw.
Like Eddie Griffin would drop in,
wasn't on the,

436
00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.180
wasn't on the schedule.

437
00:25:05.181 --> 00:25:09.950
He would drop in at 9:00 PM and get off stage at 3:00 AM and that was real.

438
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.330
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was real six hours.
That would kill me.

439
00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.220
And uh,
and then when he was done,
he be like,
who's next?

440
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.910
Who's next day?
He didn't six hours.
What's the longest that you've ever done?

441
00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.830
I think an hour and 40 minutes.
Maybe a little longer.

442
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.230
I don't remember,
but I think an hour and 40 minutes.

443
00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:37.410
Probably the longest I've ever done.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But that's too long.
Too Long.
Yeah.

444
00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.680
An hour and 20 is more than anybody should ever have to hear you talk.
Yeah.

445
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:46.430
And even that,
it's like pushing it.
What I like.
I like,
I like to do,

446
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:51.290
when I do like a theater I two an hour or an hour and 10 and I just want,

447
00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:55.820
I just want to just start and then finish,
just come on,

448
00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:57.560
go ready.

449
00:25:57.561 --> 00:26:02.561
And then for one hour I want everything to be tight and concise and I would way

450
00:26:02.811 --> 00:26:07.811
rather have an hour and 10 minutes that people really enjoyed versus an hour and

451
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.390
a half where they're like an hour of it was really funny because then it leaves

452
00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:15.260
you with this even if it's the same hour,
that extra time.

453
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.830
I also just think the audience doesn't want to see more than an hour of comedy.

454
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:23.060
And it's like people were like,
oh I did three hours the other night.
Like why?

455
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.720
Like the audience must have hated it.
Like Chapelle used to drop into the cellar.

456
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:28.970
He liked Dan Cooper going back and forth.

457
00:26:28.971 --> 00:26:33.590
Like who could do the longer set logs ever world record,
like world records.
Yeah.

458
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:36.140
And then I think Bob Marley eventually broke it or something.
Uh,

459
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.290
Bob Marley from Maine.
Yeah.
Didn't he do like two days on stage?
Funky bitches.

460
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.100
And,
uh,
but it,
Chappelle was down there one time when I was like,
Oh,

461
00:26:44.101 --> 00:26:44.911
I'm gonna go check it out.

462
00:26:44.911 --> 00:26:48.450
And it was like almost unwatchable because it was like the pacing that they have

463
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.020
that you have to do in order to be on stage that long.
And he was funny,

464
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.170
but it would be like not funny for long stretches than a big punch line.

465
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.330
And then back into it.
The you're like,
all right,

466
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.140
like the show Dave was on hiatus,
right?

467
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.910
That was when Dave kind of like took time off a comedy for a long time.
He Co,

468
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.010
I mean kind of like he wasn't doing specials,

469
00:27:08.011 --> 00:27:11.310
but I think he was doing like surprise shows.
Like he was always,

470
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.240
always kind of on tour in weird venues.
He's still doing that now.
You know,

471
00:27:15.241 --> 00:27:17.780
he's not always doing like big,
big giant theaters.

472
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:22.770
So like he'll just want a book,
like a 20 seat room and uh,
make as agents crazy.

473
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.950
Well,
he's been doing,
he's been doing the lab at the Improv,

474
00:27:25.951 --> 00:27:29.490
that little tiny room,
which is what,
50 50 seats maybe.
Yeah,

475
00:27:29.491 --> 00:27:33.390
he did it as zs did it.
That's a,
that's a place for comedy dies.

476
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.360
That little fucked up room.
I have always hated that room.
That room sucks.

477
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.570
Every deck on the planet.
When people are like,
oh you can try new stuff.

478
00:27:39.571 --> 00:27:43.530
It's like I can try the new stuff in the main room for a good crowd.

479
00:27:43.531 --> 00:27:46.980
Like why do I want to do this little terrible room?

480
00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:47.814
I don't know why it's even the,

481
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:51.270
well it's a weird one was cause the belly room is perfect.

482
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.340
The belly room works.
Yeah,

483
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.330
but somewhat for some reason that lab seems like why is there a comedy here?

484
00:27:57.331 --> 00:28:00.990
What is,
why is the door right there?
Why is this treat right there?
What is this?

485
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.910
Yeah.
What is this here?
What do you got going on here?
Everything about it.

486
00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.740
It's like I was trying to tell them,
I go turn that into the comics green room.

487
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.190
Like no,
there's good comedy.
Then I'm like,
shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth.

488
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.380
You turn that into the comics cream room.
Yeah.

489
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.950
They used to be where the bar was from my now they used to be like where

490
00:28:16.951 --> 00:28:19.740
everybody's hanging out before the show.
It was great.
It was great,

491
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.590
and he'd go in the other room and to go on stage and you would go from that part

492
00:28:23.591 --> 00:28:26.760
to go on stage.
Now everybody goes from the front door to go on stage,

493
00:28:26.761 --> 00:28:30.060
so you're trapped in that little hallway and you're like,
where the fuck?

494
00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:32.790
How do I,
where do I hide?
There's nowhere to hide.

495
00:28:32.791 --> 00:28:35.700
That's why I love the stores so much because there's so many places to hide,

496
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.100
but the store has a little problem with the,
or like when you,

497
00:28:39.101 --> 00:28:40.610
right before you're about to go on stage,

498
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.200
you're in the hallway and he had only at the hallway,

499
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.770
but I liked those seats against the back.
That just for comics do.

500
00:28:46.771 --> 00:28:49.740
You can kind of sit there and go over your notes and we'll leave you alone.

501
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:54.480
I love that backbar.
Yeah,
back bars.
My favorite,
the back bars,
the shit,

502
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:59.610
the secret comedians bar.
I mean that's just what they've done in the new,

503
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:04.470
this new generation of managers and the people that run the place now they've

504
00:29:04.471 --> 00:29:07.030
sort of like really paid attention to like what,

505
00:29:07.031 --> 00:29:09.990
what's going to make these guys happier?
What's going to make this better?

506
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:12.000
Like you gotta give him a place where they can hide.

507
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.580
So given that back bar and you'd go to the back part any day,

508
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:19.200
it's filled with people just hanging out,
talking shit and like,
it's fun.

509
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:23.160
It's like a fun play.
I go there,
I gravitate and I get into the back end.

510
00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:25.080
I'm like,
Oh,
look at all these cool people.
Yeah.

511
00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:29.880
This is a great spot to hang out it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They did that.
They added security.

512
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:33.840
They did it.
So it's,
it's night and day two,
the way it used to be.

513
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.360
I never used to go there.
I didn't like hanging out there.

514
00:29:36.361 --> 00:29:40.800
I didn't like any part of it.
And then once,
uh,
once the new management took over,

515
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.033
I was like,
oh,
great.
Like

516
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.400
<v 2>I once did a show there,
I did a benefit.
There was like a kid who died,</v>

517
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.510
I forget his name,
he was a comic,
uh,

518
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:51.880
died in a car accident and they had like a benefit for his family.
Oh yeah.

519
00:29:51.881 --> 00:29:56.640
That's Josh.
Adam Meyers friend.
Well,
Angelo.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Angela.
Angela Bowers.

520
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.210
I did not know him.
I didn't know him either,
but uh,

521
00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:01.360
he was like a fan of mine and I was like,

522
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:05.170
I was like his favorite comic they could get and I'm like on the,

523
00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:07.960
I'm on the marquis,
it's a sold out show.
I have a great set.

524
00:30:07.961 --> 00:30:11.380
I walk off and Tommy comes up and he's like,
uh,
the old manager was like,
Andy,

525
00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:13.080
that was great when we got,
we've got to get you around you.
You got,

526
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:15.550
you've got to start hanging out,
you know,
you got to start hanging out and doing,

527
00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.770
do you know,
doing the open mic and stuff.

528
00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:20.830
And I'm like [inaudible] my name is on the marquee right now.

529
00:30:20.831 --> 00:30:24.490
You just watched me headline the show.
Like what are you talking about?

530
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.430
And I then the,
I don't think I ever saw him again.

531
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.070
Next thing I knew he was fired and they were like,
what can we do to,

532
00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:30.904
to get you back here?

533
00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.880
<v 1>Well that's Adam,
right?
Adam did the same thing to me.</v>

534
00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.910
He told me that Tommy got fired and came to visit me.
The improv.

535
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.310
<v 2>So you were gone seven years,
seven years from the store.</v>

536
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.290
And then when Tommy left,
they brought you back in?

537
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.450
<v 1>Well,
there's two reasons.
One,</v>

538
00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:51.840
I had to go physically to the store because Ari was filming his comedy central

539
00:30:52.781 --> 00:30:57.550
special and is like that.
He's a,

540
00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:00.340
you know,
he's just one of my best friends.

541
00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:06.220
And I knew him from the time he was a doorman and I knew that him filming his

542
00:31:06.221 --> 00:31:10.540
special there was so important and there's no hours can it miss it?
I was like,

543
00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:15.280
I have to be here,
like I have to see this at the store.
So I was like,
oh fuck.

544
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.980
All right,
I gotta go back.
And so I decided to go back.

545
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:20.390
I think he was filming on a Wednesday.
What,

546
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.290
what night is a gross battles on Tuesday,
right?

547
00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:24.820
So I went down there on a Tuesday.
I said,

548
00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:26.740
let me go down on Tuesday just to see what's up.

549
00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:31.360
And I went to roast battle and I was like,
Holy Shit,
this place is electric.

550
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.930
This is crazy.
Like the environment is so much different.
It's so creative.

551
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:38.770
And the,
the night that I was at Rose Battle was fucking fantastic.

552
00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:43.660
It was so good.
There was so many funny roasters and I remember thinking,
wow,

553
00:31:43.661 --> 00:31:47.470
this place is just different,
man.
It just feels so much different.

554
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.830
And it wasn't like it is now.
Like now,

555
00:31:50.831 --> 00:31:55.390
like you'll go on a Saturday night,
they'll have six sold out shows,

556
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.270
they have two shows in the belly room,
two and the o r two in the main room.

557
00:31:58.271 --> 00:32:01.240
Everything's sold out and packed with headliners and it's chaos.

558
00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.313
It wasn't like that.

559
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.620
It was still sort of shitty like in terms of like the numbers,

560
00:32:05.621 --> 00:32:08.620
but the vibe and the creativity was way different.

561
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.980
And the new guys and girls that were coming up,

562
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:16.210
they were fucking good man.
I was like,
wow,
this is a different vibe.

563
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:21.340
I had been gone for almost a decade.
Yeah.
So that brought me in.
I,
like I said,

564
00:32:21.341 --> 00:32:24.600
I had to be there for Ari.
There was no way I,

565
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.120
there's no way I could miss it.
I had to be there.
So I'm like,
all right,

566
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.630
I just got to swallow it.
And that was probably what Adam for sure helped,

567
00:32:31.631 --> 00:32:36.160
but I might've stayed away forever if it wasn't for Ari.
I just had to see it.

568
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.800
<v 2>Do you like roast battle?
Do you like judging that?</v>

569
00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:45.760
<v 1>I cringe sometimes cause they're so fucking mean.</v>

570
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.310
Yeah,
sometimes people are so mean,
you know?
Um,

571
00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:56.710
uh,
but I do like it.
I do love the writing aspect of it.

572
00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:01.060
I love the fact that it's a joke writers forum but I don't want to name any

573
00:33:01.061 --> 00:33:04.770
names of this one comic that I'm friends with that does really well and roast

574
00:33:04.771 --> 00:33:06.700
battle and I said,
hey man,
how come you,

575
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:10.060
when you roast you have all this good new material but you're doing the same

576
00:33:10.061 --> 00:33:12.160
stupid shit when you go on stage all the time.

577
00:33:12.161 --> 00:33:14.860
Like you were doing the same set for years.
You're not,

578
00:33:14.861 --> 00:33:17.890
you're not advancing cause you're not writing a lot,

579
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:22.120
but you're writing a lot when you write for roasts and I'm like you should treat

580
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.590
like your material.

581
00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.620
Like the same way you treat your material when you have to roast.
I,

582
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:32.410
the thing about the roast is like say if a you are going to roast with Tony

583
00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:36.070
Hinchcliffe,
you guys know each other,
you know who you're writing for.
I,
Tony,

584
00:33:36.071 --> 00:33:37.510
what does he look like?
He looks like,
you know,

585
00:33:37.511 --> 00:33:41.110
you start fucking around with all I know this about Tony and that about towing.

586
00:33:41.111 --> 00:33:44.890
This is going to be funny and it forces you to be creative.

587
00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:49.120
Whereas I think there's so many guys that they,
they develop,
um,

588
00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:53.440
a framework of a set and then they just kind of like that.
That is their comfort.

589
00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.920
The comfort is in the fact that they know,
even if it's not good,

590
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:59.890
they know that they can go from this to that and that this,

591
00:33:59.891 --> 00:34:02.710
and they know where they're going and they don't,
they're not lost.
You know?

592
00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:08.120
And I think that the beautiful thing about the roast is none of that material

593
00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:11.410
you can do in any other place,
you can only do it right there.

594
00:34:11.411 --> 00:34:12.490
So you have to work on that.

595
00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:16.600
And so oftentimes you see like what comics capable of when they're roasting

596
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:19.990
versus what they're doing when they're actually doing the real set,

597
00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:20.950
which seems stale.

598
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.720
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
I feel like it's almost,
um,</v>

599
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.220
I agree with everything you're saying that it's almost like a,

600
00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:32.260
it's not beneficial to be like a really good bad roast battle and not as a

601
00:34:32.261 --> 00:34:33.220
stance like it takes,

602
00:34:33.221 --> 00:34:35.770
it can take away from stand up and people think it's like this,

603
00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:40.120
this path to glory and I'm not sure that it is.
No,
I don't think it is.

604
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:41.103
I think it's a

605
00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:44.310
<v 1>exercise if you're,
if you're treating all of your comedy,</v>

606
00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:47.460
the way you treat the roast battle,
like you're always working on it.

607
00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:49.650
But I think there's a lot of guys just aren't working on,

608
00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:54.920
I think part of our problem is this no other art form like stand up where

609
00:34:55.861 --> 00:34:57.510
there's low.
Like you were telling me,

610
00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.630
you were saying how you took a class to learn to get on stage,

611
00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:04.500
but you were quick to add and almost every great comic does this and he really

612
00:35:04.501 --> 00:35:07.290
didn't learn anything in that class but now,
but it got you to the stage.

613
00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:12.860
That's weird that there's nothing like the best education that we have is

614
00:35:14.131 --> 00:35:17.160
talking to each other.
Like,
like,
how do you write?
How do you do it?

615
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:20.730
And I'm always,
I've been doing comedy 30 years and I'm always like,

616
00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.710
how do you do it?
What are you doing?
What are you doing this?

617
00:35:22.711 --> 00:35:25.920
Why are you doing it that way?
What do you write?
Do you write it out?
Like,

618
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:28.920
and everybody's got a different thing.
Like bill bird doesn't write anything out,

619
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.750
just his notes and works it out on stage.
You know,
he writes it,

620
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.330
he has these ideas in his head and then he rants and you know,

621
00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:40.650
he uses podcast to develop a lot of his material because his podcast is unique

622
00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:41.910
in that it's just him talking.

623
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.390
But everybody's got a different thing and there's no one who's right.

624
00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:49.740
<v 2>No one's no one's right.
Was it standing up with said that if you tell,</v>

625
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:51.180
if you give a comic advice,

626
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.450
you're just telling them how to be more like you [inaudible] you know that I

627
00:35:54.451 --> 00:35:56.910
kind of agree with it.
You can say like write more,

628
00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.640
get on stage as much as you can.
You know,
that's important.

629
00:35:59.641 --> 00:36:03.030
But there are things even in comedy that like you hear early on the,

630
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.640
it takes 10 years to understand,
you know,
like I remember the movie,
uh,
um,

631
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:12.450
the movie comedian with Jerry Seinfeld was like a huge influence on me and

632
00:36:12.451 --> 00:36:15.000
there's one point where Seinfeld's kind of depressed and he's like,

633
00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:16.500
Colin Quinn's like,
what's the matter?
He's like,

634
00:36:16.501 --> 00:36:18.450
I just don't know when I'll be back.
You know,

635
00:36:18.451 --> 00:36:22.050
when I'll feel like I'm back again with this new material.
And Colin Quinn says,

636
00:36:22.051 --> 00:36:25.140
uh,
when you're onstage and you're killing and you're miserable,

637
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.930
that's when you'll,
you'll know your back.
Like we were just like,
great,

638
00:36:27.931 --> 00:36:31.200
I'm making these idiots laugh.
And Seinfeld was dying laughing and I have like,

639
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:35.220
I saw that and I didn't understand what he meant.
And now I know exactly,

640
00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.230
<v 1>you know.
Well,
if I could go back to when that was filming,</v>

641
00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:44.320
I would grab horny Adams and go,
don't do it.
Don't let them do this to you,
man.

642
00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:47.170
How long have you been doing comedy?
Don't let them do this.

643
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.770
They're going to put you that they're doing this to make Jerry look better.

644
00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:51.910
Don't let him do it.

645
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:56.190
<v 2>[inaudible] I mean he must've thought it was like the biggest thing in the world</v>

646
00:36:56.191 --> 00:37:00.120
for him.
Uh,
and I'm so mad.
Like I love that movie.

647
00:37:00.121 --> 00:37:04.170
I watched the DVD once a year and there's no Arnie Adam's commentary track.

648
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.620
They shouldn't give him one.
I think they don't reference it.

649
00:37:07.621 --> 00:37:10.200
Like in the other comment,
there'll be only,
we'll talk about this in his,

650
00:37:10.201 --> 00:37:14.190
and I think he was so angry with the way he was portrayed that he refused to do

651
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:14.970
one.

652
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:16.140
<v 1>He'll be here.
They portray,</v>

653
00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.950
I mean they just edited him it the worst aspects of it.

654
00:37:19.951 --> 00:37:23.820
They didn't want to give a nuanced perspective on who he is and what he's doing.

655
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.920
They just wanted him to be like the young guy who's trying to figure it out

656
00:37:28.921 --> 00:37:31.530
versus the old,
you know,
legend

657
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.210
<v 2>[inaudible] but they would like,
my friends would use them as an example.</v>

658
00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:36.890
Like if I was like acting like a jerk,
they'd be like,

659
00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:38.230
you're behaving like pointing at him.

660
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:42.620
Like you need to like I came in second and like a comedy competition and I was

661
00:37:42.621 --> 00:37:45.080
mad about it and they were like,
don't be like a warning.
And I was like,

662
00:37:45.081 --> 00:37:46.100
thank you.
Got It.

663
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:50.480
Well he's doing great now.

664
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:54.430
I mean already is doing far but I've met him a couple of times.
He's,
he's,

665
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.370
he's always been nice to me.
It's nice guy.

666
00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:01.340
I once did a show at the Improv was years ago and it's an eight o'clock show.

667
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:04.820
I'm the,
I'm the,
I'm,
I'm not the headliner,
the owner's going on after me,

668
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.190
but it's like I'm the biggest name on the,

669
00:38:07.191 --> 00:38:11.270
on the marquee and I get there and there's six people in the audience and two of

670
00:38:11.271 --> 00:38:14.870
them were like friends of mine who had never seen me perform and I was like,

671
00:38:14.871 --> 00:38:18.000
this is humiliating.
I was like,
what?
I'm like yelling at the staff and like,

672
00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:20.750
how do you have six people here at 8:00 PM on a Friday?

673
00:38:20.751 --> 00:38:22.220
I can go to the store right now and it's,

674
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:24.470
the five rooms are sold out like what's going on?

675
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:28.040
And I get onstage and I'm so embarrassed to my friends who see me that I'm

676
00:38:28.041 --> 00:38:29.690
yelling at the staff.

677
00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.900
Staff members are walking by and I'm screaming at them like yelling at the sound

678
00:38:32.901 --> 00:38:36.040
guy,
don't even,
I don't even do a joke.
I like put the mic down.
I'm like

679
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.630
<v 0>fuck this place.
I'm never coming back.</v>

680
00:38:37.631 --> 00:38:41.140
And I leave and I see my friends a couple of days later and I'm like,

681
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:43.240
so sorry about that.
They're like,
no,
you were funny.
They go,

682
00:38:43.241 --> 00:38:47.080
the guy who went after you,
that guy was angry and I'm like,

683
00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:51.100
that guy was angry.
I yelled at the sound guy for 15 minutes.
Like,

684
00:38:51.101 --> 00:38:55.930
what the hell did he do?
The improv had those dark moments.

685
00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:00.100
They still kind of do sometimes like shop did a show there recently on Friday

686
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.450
night it was 25 people in the crowd.
I blew up at uh,

687
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.760
like the new booker there.
They called me up and then like,

688
00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:08.980
we would love to have you back as we see her at the store.

689
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.140
What can we do to get you back at the Improv?
And I'm like,

690
00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.890
email me once a once a week and tell me what spots you have.

691
00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:17.440
And I'll tell you when I can go.
Like,
all right,
like I'm booked for Wednesday,

692
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:21.130
I see the lineup,
it's like me five people,
Tiffany Haddish.
I'm like,
great.

693
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.630
Should be good.
Show Day of the improv emails me and they're like,
listen,

694
00:39:25.631 --> 00:39:29.830
Tiffany Haddish wants to do an hour and she wants you to introduce her,

695
00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:33.520
so it's just going to be the two of you guys know Mc.
And I'm like,

696
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:39.090
did you just bump me down to opening act like without and not asking if this is

697
00:39:39.371 --> 00:39:43.620
okay,
just like you're now the MC going up cold,
uh,
that I was.

698
00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:48.220
And I'm like,
all right,
I'll be there,
but know that I'm furious.
And they're like,

699
00:39:48.221 --> 00:39:49.390
why aren't you just cancel?
And I'm like,

700
00:39:49.391 --> 00:39:52.240
because I want you to know how mad I am and I'm never coming back here.

701
00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:55.360
And Tiffany was great.
That was nice to her.
Uh,
but I was just,

702
00:39:55.361 --> 00:39:58.010
I couldn't believe that they would treat me with like that.

703
00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:01.080
I'm there tomorrow night at the Improv.
I'm there all the time.
Yeah.

704
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:05.950
You want to do a set that maybe don't sold out.
Sold out.
Actually I got a,

705
00:40:05.951 --> 00:40:09.100
I'm going to dinner to celebrate the special dam.
Yeah,

706
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:12.670
it's good if you catch it with a packed crowd.

707
00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:17.370
It's just they didn't have the right approach to,

708
00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:21.340
to marketing.
Yeah.
That's all it is.
But it used to,
when I first started,

709
00:40:21.341 --> 00:40:25.840
that was the club.
That was where I went when I left the store.

710
00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.790
When I left the store for seven years,

711
00:40:27.791 --> 00:40:31.750
I did my sets at the Improv at the ice house.
Haha.
I did.

712
00:40:31.751 --> 00:40:36.330
I'm just anywhere else.
But the store laugh factory?
No,
no,
no.

713
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.420
Never.
They film you.
Yes.
Yeah.

714
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.720
And they put people up when they put,
they've done it with me.

715
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.960
They put your shit up online and they say they don't do it anymore but it's too

716
00:40:46.961 --> 00:40:49.080
late.
You can't just do that.
Yeah.

717
00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.760
And their attitude about it was very disappointing.

718
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.800
Like when I told them that I wanted to take my shit down,
they,

719
00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.480
they were not,
they weren't,

720
00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:04.000
they weren't understanding or apologetic until it became a big deal.
Yeah.

721
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:08.200
Like big deal.
Like,
you know,
like how to get other people involved.

722
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.910
It was not good.

723
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:13.690
It's not wise to think that you could just film people and put them online when

724
00:41:13.691 --> 00:41:16.980
they're working out for free.
Yeah.
Yeah.

725
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:21.130
Especially like a guy like you who's going to do a fucking Netflix special,

726
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:25.600
so you're going to release this stuff and put it online long before Netflix gets

727
00:41:25.601 --> 00:41:29.170
ahold of it.
And the attitude about it,
it just wasn't good.
I mean,

728
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.950
it's a great club.
I've worked there many,
many times.
I just don't do it anymore.

729
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:33.980
Yeah.
You know,
just

730
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.120
<v 1>get it together.
You know this,
this is the fucking big leagues.</v>

731
00:41:38.121 --> 00:41:38.931
We're in Hollywood.

732
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:43.280
This is not like some fucking shit hole comedy club in the middle of nowhere

733
00:41:43.281 --> 00:41:46.670
that nobody goes to.
This is on the sunset strip.

734
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.170
This is in Hollywood.
And you're doing that,
like,
what do you guys,

735
00:41:51.171 --> 00:41:54.290
what are you doing?
Yeah.
You couldn't trust them.
It just was ridiculous.

736
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:58.940
But it's a great club.
Me Go there and you'll see great comedy.
It's,

737
00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.340
it's a fucking killer set up.
You know,
it's,

738
00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.880
there's a lot of the pieces are in place for it to be amazing.

739
00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:08.080
<v 2>Yeah.
I was going back for a little bit,
but they would like,</v>

740
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:09.940
they would use me to promote the whole show.

741
00:42:09.941 --> 00:42:12.100
It's a good thing cause if it's just my show,
right,

742
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:15.250
I'm just doing 15 minutes and making the same money as everybody else in the

743
00:42:15.251 --> 00:42:19.420
lineup.
Like if I'm at the comedy store,
it's like me,
you delete a Sebastian.

744
00:42:19.421 --> 00:42:23.320
Like you don't feel that pressure and we're all in it together kind of thing.

745
00:42:23.321 --> 00:42:27.760
That it,
I,
I enjoyed the store a lot more than just the way they promote.

746
00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.380
I feel less pressure.
Yeah.

747
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:34.030
<v 1>The quality of the comedy is better.
And at the store,
and this is like,</v>

748
00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:37.630
there's something about that that I think is like one of the things that's

749
00:42:37.631 --> 00:42:42.631
happened from the seven years ago or the seven years when I was gone versus now,

750
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:45.460
which I've been back like almost four years.
It'll be four years,

751
00:42:45.461 --> 00:42:48.580
November of five years.
November is that,
um,

752
00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:54.450
it's better for me to see guys like you and to see guys like Neil Brennan and,

753
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:59.320
and all these,
the asis working with killers,
just,

754
00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:04.530
just this lineup of like where I know that if there's 400 people in that

755
00:43:04.631 --> 00:43:07.300
audience,
they're coming to see everybody.
They're not just coming to see me.

756
00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:11.410
And I think that's,
that's critical for developing material.

757
00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.150
I think it's critical for putting,

758
00:43:13.151 --> 00:43:16.300
piecing stuff together and putting an act together.

759
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.540
It's like I need a balanced audience.

760
00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:23.590
I don't want to perform for the,
the converted,
you know what I mean?

761
00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.020
<v 2>Exactly.
Like if I,
like I,</v>

762
00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:28.560
I feel like the store is like a gym where you're working out where like you're

763
00:43:28.561 --> 00:43:31.980
not getting the same,
I don't get the same laughs at the store that I do.

764
00:43:31.981 --> 00:43:36.900
If I go to Largo and every single person there has paid 30 bucks just to see me

765
00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:41.340
so that like,
it makes it easier.
But because I've worked at the store like you,

766
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.690
it's like I've earned that at Largo.
Yeah.

767
00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.670
But if I just did Largo all the time and that was it,
I wouldn't be as good.

768
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.750
You know,
you need to kind of,
you need to suffer a little bit.
So nice

769
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:53.810
<v 1>at Largo.
[inaudible] I did,</v>

770
00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:58.880
I did Whitney show at Largo and uh,
it was,
it was so,
so nice.
And then,

771
00:43:58.881 --> 00:44:03.650
uh,
I did this bit about mocking feminists and I could say like,

772
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.400
I don't like feminists for the same reason why I don't like white people or only

773
00:44:07.401 --> 00:44:11.330
into white people.
Like I like people who like everybody,
like I'm,

774
00:44:11.331 --> 00:44:16.310
I'm not interested in anybody who's really only into one thing,
you know,
like,

775
00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:20.400
come on,
stop.
Yeah.
Like it's nonsense.
Like I do,

776
00:44:20.401 --> 00:44:23.840
do women need equal rights?
I fucking course of course.
Yeah.

777
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:26.390
But I don't want to hear you talk about it all the time.
It's annoying.

778
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:28.700
And you could see like the tightening up,

779
00:44:28.701 --> 00:44:31.950
like someone saying that they don't like feminists.
Like it's like,
oh,

780
00:44:31.951 --> 00:44:36.120
you guys are indoctrinated.
I see what this is.
And so then I felt like,

781
00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:41.200
and it helped me actually develop this one piece that I was doing and that be

782
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:45.740
like sort of around it rounded out this one piece I was doing because it was

783
00:44:45.741 --> 00:44:50.340
trying to figure out a way that I could explain it to someone who might have a

784
00:44:50.341 --> 00:44:53.410
preconceived notion about who I am,
like the,

785
00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:57.870
to to say it in a way that makes people that were hesitant,

786
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.270
laugh,
you know what I mean?

787
00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:05.130
Versus savages at 1130 on a Saturday night that are hammered.

788
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.920
Yeah.
So Whitney Cummings crowd wasn't a endear.
Antifeminist still laughed.

789
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.790
They laughed because the punchline was good and I had a place to go with it and

790
00:45:14.791 --> 00:45:19.740
the place to go was ultimately mocking men's rights activists.
That was the,

791
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:24.480
the real thing was the,
the,
this,
the setup for that joke is,

792
00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.550
I don't like anybody's into one thing and I go,

793
00:45:26.551 --> 00:45:30.290
but what tries to be the most fucking crazy is men's rights activists.

794
00:45:30.291 --> 00:45:33.210
And like every men's rights activist I ever met,
I just want to grab them and go,

795
00:45:33.211 --> 00:45:37.530
dude,
we got them all.
Yeah.
We got all the rights.
Yeah,
we got them all.

796
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.100
I can't believe that's a real thing.
Men's rights activists,
it's a real thing.

797
00:45:41.101 --> 00:45:45.330
If you get divorced and you have child,
uh,
it's uh,
for child custody,

798
00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.390
those things or do those things are real.
Like guys really,

799
00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:53.391
I know men who have gotten really fucked over in divorce where their wife hired

800
00:45:53.701 --> 00:45:58.290
a fucking killer lawyer and they drag them through.
See the thing about,

801
00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:03.130
and I learned this from Phil Hartman,
unfortunately before he died,
uh,

802
00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.570
I was trying to tell him to get divorced and I said,
just give her half man,

803
00:46:06.571 --> 00:46:10.020
you'll make more money.
He goes,
it's not half.
He goes,
it's two thirds.

804
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.650
He goes to fucking lawyers,
take a third.
It's a Goddamn scam.
You know,
he like,

805
00:46:13.651 --> 00:46:16.950
he was furious about it because apparently he had been trying to figure it out,

806
00:46:16.951 --> 00:46:20.520
like how to do it.
But I had a friend whose wife,

807
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:25.610
ex wife dragged it out on purpose because she wanted him to pay the legal bills.

808
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:28.500
So he had to pay for her lawyer.

809
00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:33.830
He had to pay for his lawyer and then he had to pay for all of the Times that

810
00:46:36.421 --> 00:46:41.280
she decided to change the goalposts and mu and renegotiate like just no one can

811
00:46:41.281 --> 00:46:43.500
say that you can't renegotiate.

812
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:47.520
So she would just renegotiate and just drag things out.
And her,

813
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:51.240
her goal was to try to drain him financially.

814
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:54.600
So she was doing this on purpose,
like targeting.

815
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:59.580
So he was essentially paying for the general of the army that was plotting to

816
00:46:59.581 --> 00:47:00.414
murder him.

817
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:04.950
And he was slowly going crazy and I was watching my friend go crazy and it took

818
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.580
several years for it to be completely resolved and he's still paying her,

819
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:09.211
he's still,

820
00:47:09.211 --> 00:47:13.920
but he's been divorced for I think 12 years now and he's still pays her.

821
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:17.820
She didn't have a child and he has a family now.

822
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:22.500
He's married with children now.
He,
and he still pays this person still.

823
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:27.060
Like he fucked her so hard.
She can't work 12 years later.
Yeah,

824
00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:32.090
it's so that's where men's rights activists have a point because if you're in a

825
00:47:32.171 --> 00:47:37.171
state that's particularly a progressive or liberal in regards to alimony and

826
00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:42.130
child support,
the only,
the only thing that we win on that,
it's like Tom Arnold,

827
00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:45.790
like we got one on the board for Tom Arnold when he divorced,

828
00:47:45.791 --> 00:47:49.660
but the problem with that is I love Roseanne more than I love Tom Arnold.

829
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.000
No offense Tom.
But I do,
you know,

830
00:47:52.001 --> 00:47:54.700
so like it bothered me that Roseanne had to pay him like,
Bro,

831
00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.330
get the fuck Outta here.
You,
you can work like why?

832
00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:02.260
How come we you with a successful person if that's successful person says

833
00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:04.240
fucking kicked,
Brex get outta here.

834
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:08.770
You have to pay them that that person has to pay the person.

835
00:48:08.771 --> 00:48:13.730
They're getting rid of what?
Oh,
he's used to her lifestyle.
What?
That,
that,

836
00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:16.960
that I'm used to it is a thing.
Yeah.

837
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.340
It's the only thing that makes sense is childcare.
That makes sense.
Like,
Hey,

838
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:25.750
this person is taking care of the children.
They're your children.

839
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.490
You guys had these children together.
You have to contribute to the,
the,
the,

840
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:34.360
the money that it costs to raise a child.
100% I get it.
What?

841
00:48:34.361 --> 00:48:38.560
I don't get his alimony.
I just don't get it.
We're not together anymore.

842
00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.410
Now how we were before we were together and you didn't have any money and then

843
00:48:41.411 --> 00:48:44.710
you met me and now I have money and then you,
you got used to having money.
Well,

844
00:48:44.711 --> 00:48:47.260
you're going to have to get used to not having money because now you don't have

845
00:48:47.261 --> 00:48:50.740
any money because now we're not together anymore.
Or like a year maybe.

846
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:53.700
You know what I mean?
Like Dave let her take some time to get back on her feet.

847
00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:58.240
Right.
But a prostitute or anything.
Yeah.
You don't have to be just bitterness.

848
00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:02.280
It's like,
I want to take you for everything that I can.
What am I friends with?

849
00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.670
Who's going through a divorce?
He was like,

850
00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:08.920
all my friends who've gotten a divorce,
I mean,
80% of them,
if they have kids,

851
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:12.730
the wife accuses the husband of molesting the kids.
Oh,
Jesus.

852
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:17.430
Just for visitation,
you know,
just,
just like for negotiation with this.
Yeah,

853
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:20.350
exactly.
Well the lawyers are onto that now.
You know,
I mean,

854
00:49:20.351 --> 00:49:24.580
this is actually something that my friend was warned of when the him and him and

855
00:49:24.581 --> 00:49:27.920
his wife were splitting up like,
is your wife malicious?
Will she,
you know,

856
00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.510
make some sort of a baseless accusation?
And he's like,
how so?

857
00:49:31.511 --> 00:49:35.580
And then they went into that.
Yeah man,
there's evil people out there that,

858
00:49:35.581 --> 00:49:39.330
and there's also this thing that happens when people break up with someone if

859
00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:41.350
someone wants it doesn't want to be with you anymore.

860
00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:45.400
Someone that you deeply loved and cared about.
You want them to suffer.

861
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:49.540
It's weird.
It's weird.
I mean it's normal.

862
00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:54.790
So I guess it's not that weird,
but the,
the evil vicious jealousy,
you know,

863
00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:57.910
like you see that vicious jealousy and chimpanzees,

864
00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:00.820
like one of the things that chimpanzees do when the attack people,

865
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:05.000
one of the things they attack people over is unfairness.
Like a,

866
00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:09.190
there was a terrible story about a guy who had kept a pet chimp and then brought

867
00:50:09.191 --> 00:50:13.300
the a chimp a birthday cake on his birthday.
Brian Posehn has a whole bit about,

868
00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:15.670
it does,
it does.
Even though,
yeah.
Um,

869
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.880
and the other chimps found out that this chimps getting a birthday cake and they

870
00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:21.730
saw it and they weren't getting any cake and they were fucking furious.

871
00:50:21.731 --> 00:50:25.390
So someone had inadvertently left one of the gates open.

872
00:50:25.391 --> 00:50:28.730
So the chimps got out toward this guy apart because of a birthday cake.

873
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:32.810
But it's that thing.
It's not like it was affecting them.
I was like,

874
00:50:32.811 --> 00:50:36.350
he was doing something bad to them.
So they got out and killed him.
No,

875
00:50:36.351 --> 00:50:39.350
they ripped his dick off because they didn't like the fact that gave the other

876
00:50:39.351 --> 00:50:43.070
champ a birthday cake.
Took his dick,
took his fingers,
took his feet.
But yeah,

877
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.860
yeah,
yeah.
[inaudible] bits.
So funny.
He's like,

878
00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:49.280
the worst thing about that story for that guy is that everyone's gonna want to

879
00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:51.170
hear it forever because it starts with,

880
00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:56.350
so it was bringing a birthday cake to a chimpanzee and then you got to hear the

881
00:50:56.361 --> 00:51:00.110
rest.
But that,
that anger and jealousy,

882
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:02.810
like there's evolution does an evolutionary basis for it.
Oh,

883
00:51:02.811 --> 00:51:06.920
is that what he looks like now?
Oh my God.
Am I going to show it?
It's tough.

884
00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:11.780
His fingers are missing.
His face has ms and he's got one eye.
His nose is gone.

885
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.040
I'll look at that.
Frown

886
00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:19.520
faces ripped apart the stitched it together that way.
Awful.

887
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:23.540
Yeah.
It's fucking awful,
man.
Yeah.

888
00:51:23.541 --> 00:51:25.990
You can't own a chimp crazy assholes.

889
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:31.160
They're the most vicious of all the primates.
Next to people I think.
Good for.

890
00:51:31.161 --> 00:51:34.610
Like you can put like train them for like the first like five years of their

891
00:51:34.611 --> 00:51:36.050
life and then they forget everything.

892
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.650
They just decided they're going to fuck you up.
Yeah.
And they're so strong.

893
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:42.290
What does that one doing?
Is that the chimp?
No,
no,

894
00:51:42.291 --> 00:51:45.800
but it just popped up in the same group of pictures of shoes.
Hairless chimp.

895
00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:50.690
There's some meaning such a,
it's such a mean species.
You know,

896
00:51:50.691 --> 00:51:55.691
there's a problem with Calibus monkeys in parts of Africa where chimps live

897
00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.430
because they've eaten so many columns.

898
00:51:58.431 --> 00:52:03.080
Monkeys that there the populations down 97%.
Yeah.

899
00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.120
They rip them apart and eat them a lot while they're alive.

900
00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:10.040
Are they tiny cubs monkeys?
It's not big.
Big enough to eat,
but,

901
00:52:10.041 --> 00:52:14.660
uh,
is a David Attenborough documentary from the 90s where they first discovered

902
00:52:14.661 --> 00:52:16.640
that chimps eat monkeys.
They really didn't know.

903
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:19.160
They thought the chimps were basically herbivores.

904
00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:23.660
And then they got this video footage of them hunting these monkeys and the way

905
00:52:23.661 --> 00:52:27.560
they would corralled them and beat them through the trees and then catch them.

906
00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:32.560
And this monkey screaming while this chimp is ripping it apart from the hips,

907
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:35.840
let just chewing it and pulling it apart from the,
and he's like,

908
00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:42.200
and he's like basically ripping his legs and his ass end off and just eating it

909
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:46.790
alive.
Got Sam.
They're fucking mean man.
They're fucking mean.

910
00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:51.290
It's a mean animal.
But w w what I get,
the fact that,
look,

911
00:52:51.291 --> 00:52:53.150
everything's mean in the jungle.

912
00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:58.070
There's big cats and poisonous snakes and spiders and it's just a hard,
hard,

913
00:52:58.071 --> 00:52:58.904
hard world.

914
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:02.810
But the thing that drives that gets me is the jealousy because I don't think

915
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:07.400
other animals experience jealousy the way chimps do.
Is that it right there,

916
00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.000
uh,
from the Attenborough that I ended up where they actually caught it?
Yeah.

917
00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:15.380
So that's a monkey in his hand.
Jesus.
Yeah,
Dude.

918
00:53:15.381 --> 00:53:19.550
The videos of it killing it while they're pulling it apart.
Like,
Whoa,

919
00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:23.110
but the,
that jealousy that I want,
you just suffer.

920
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:26.030
I didn't get that fucking cake.
Oh,
you don't got

921
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.690
<v 0>me have that cake.
I can't get any cake.</v>

922
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:31.260
I'm going to pull your fucking Dick off on a bite your nose off like that.

923
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:36.180
That is a,
as a strange trait for an animal to have.
Oh yeah.
No,

924
00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:39.530
I mean I think it's a terrible trip for a human being to have.
Oh yeah,

925
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.050
we are animals.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's something,
uh,
you got to work on,

926
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:46.830
but when it comes to divorce,
like that's that same thing.
It's like that same,

927
00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.250
I want you it all fucking software or I want to pull your deck off and that's

928
00:53:50.251 --> 00:53:51.180
why people hire,

929
00:53:51.181 --> 00:53:55.650
hit men and shit to kill their ex wives and killed her ex husband's Liam.

930
00:53:55.830 --> 00:54:00.750
People don't get less crazy as they age.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

931
00:54:00.751 --> 00:54:03.570
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
A lot of times they get more,
cause they never realized.

932
00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:07.680
It's almost over the ride's over and now you know,

933
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:12.300
you're 65 year old lady.
No one's a fuck you and your 65 year old man,

934
00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:16.020
no one's a fuck you either.
And now all of a sudden you guys are battling,

935
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:20.550
you know?
Yeah.
Battling over finances and this and that.

936
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:24.210
I can't be the best years of my life.
That's my favorite.
I did.

937
00:54:24.211 --> 00:54:27.630
I did a girl once and when we broke up she said,
I wasted all this time with you.

938
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:33.090
I said,
oh I go,
I thought we were dating.
Yeah.
I didn't know you were investing.

939
00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:37.830
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Wasted it.
Oh,
you wasted it.
Well

940
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:42.420
I guess every relationship when it's over is a waste.
Like what?

941
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:47.430
That's so bizarre,
bizarre way of looking at it.
Enjoy the present.

942
00:54:47.431 --> 00:54:49.890
Enjoy the time you had together.
Yeah.

943
00:54:49.891 --> 00:54:54.600
But if you thinking about in terms of like hitching a ride on a successful
train.

944
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:55.021
Yeah.

945
00:54:55.021 --> 00:54:58.140
If your goal is to get married and you're with someone for five years and then

946
00:54:58.141 --> 00:55:00.070
they break up the,
Oh,
you know,

947
00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:02.490
I should be with someone else and you would have married me.

948
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.400
Now I've got to find someone else.
Yeah.

949
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:10.710
The jealousy thing about the breakup,
it's so,
it's so normal.

950
00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:12.960
It's so hard for people to not be jealous.

951
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.760
Like very few people ever break up and go,
hey man,
she's cool.

952
00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:21.860
It just didn't work out.
I was Dick.
She was,
she needed some growing.
We needed,

953
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:25.620
we both needed time away.
Hey,
I wish her well.
I've never really gotten jealous.

954
00:55:25.621 --> 00:55:27.880
Like I always like when they move on,
you know what I mean?

955
00:55:27.881 --> 00:55:30.300
When like when they get a new boyfriend,
you're just like,
oh thank God.

956
00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:34.940
That's cause you're a comic.
You have opportunities,
but it's like,

957
00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:37.410
it's like you're not their responsibility anymore.
You know what I mean?

958
00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.990
They can still like,
if they're single,
they can still call you up,
you know,

959
00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:44.520
in the middle of the night.
Yeah.
I still get mad about things like still,

960
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:47.550
let's talk about this again.
What's the date and someone else.
You're like,

961
00:55:47.551 --> 00:55:49.620
all right.
Yeah.
You're someone else's problem.

962
00:55:49.621 --> 00:55:52.290
Now the best is when they have a kid with someone else.
You're like,
yes,

963
00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:57.120
it's over baby.
Yeah.
I've never talked to you again.
I'm free.
Yeah.

964
00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:00.150
It's interesting.
Then it's,
it's a,

965
00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:05.420
it's an interesting thing when you decide to touch naked bodies with the person.

966
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:10.320
Right.
Did he like it would create this bond by doing things with your bodies and

967
00:56:10.321 --> 00:56:12.570
spending time together and then you separate,

968
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:14.850
but you're always going to have this,
Yay.

969
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:17.880
But I used to touch naked bodies with her,
you know?
Yeah.

970
00:56:17.881 --> 00:56:20.280
We used to get together and we used to do things together.

971
00:56:20.281 --> 00:56:24.010
We don't do it anymore,
but I did it.
I did it back in the day.
I got her naked and

972
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:28.120
<v 2>we got naked together.
The history.
Yeah.
It's history.
It's weird,
you know?
Yeah.</v>

973
00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:32.470
Yeah.
She'll never forget.
I won't either.
We touched each other.
Yeah.

974
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:36.670
I liked the idea of like relationships.
Looking back fondly on relationships.

975
00:56:36.671 --> 00:56:38.380
I never felt like I wasted my time.

976
00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:41.800
The people that I've dated that I'm like probably shouldn't have done that.
But,

977
00:56:41.801 --> 00:56:45.520
uh,
but for the most part I try to,
uh,
have good feelings about it.

978
00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:48.790
You don't wanna,
you don't wanna hate like a period of your life now.

979
00:56:48.791 --> 00:56:51.670
It's pointless.
But there's lessons learned.

980
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:55.210
Those ones that I've had that were like,
Ugh,
that's how,

981
00:56:55.211 --> 00:56:59.950
you know what,
when you date someone and it's cool when they're,
they're good.

982
00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:03.620
You got it.
Like I dated this girl long,
long time ago who's super negative

983
00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.220
<v 1>per negative all the time.</v>

984
00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:08.940
And then I dated this other girl right afterwards who was not negative at all.

985
00:57:08.941 --> 00:57:11.850
She was always laughing about stuff and joking around.
No matter what.

986
00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:14.910
Like even if it like a car get in an accident,
she'd take a deep breath and go,

987
00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:21.060
wow,
that car's fucked up.
And she would start laughing and I was like,
oh,

988
00:57:21.061 --> 00:57:23.190
this,
there's different ways to handle things.

989
00:57:23.191 --> 00:57:26.470
Like if you get stuck with your high school sweetheart and,
and,

990
00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.970
and she's a pain in the ass forever,
uh,
you never understand.

991
00:57:29.971 --> 00:57:32.730
Like there are the exact same circumstances.

992
00:57:32.731 --> 00:57:35.400
One person is going to handle it completely differently.

993
00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:36.930
And if you're with that person,

994
00:57:36.931 --> 00:57:40.740
it's going to be a totally different experience where it'll be a bonding

995
00:57:40.741 --> 00:57:45.210
experience versus them woe is meaning for the next six months and bringing it

996
00:57:45.211 --> 00:57:48.510
back to,
I can't even look at a tourist cause it reminds me of when I got in that

997
00:57:48.511 --> 00:57:50.010
accident.
Tourists,

998
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:54.670
well I fucked those a year ago.

999
00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:56.870
<v 2>I like when people are together for a long time.</v>

1000
00:57:56.871 --> 00:58:00.650
They break up and then the guy gets married to the next woman he runs into

1001
00:58:00.651 --> 00:58:01.820
instantly,
instantly.

1002
00:58:01.821 --> 00:58:04.910
It's like he just like found the opposite of what he'd been dealing with and was

1003
00:58:04.911 --> 00:58:07.820
just like so over the moon about it.
They had to marry right away.

1004
00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:11.770
Then I'm an old buddy of mine,
he did an actress and then it was just,
uh,

1005
00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:14.450
you know,
it was just brutal.
Everything was career,

1006
00:58:14.451 --> 00:58:17.960
this career that it was about her career was trying to help her career and,

1007
00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.560
and that they broke up and he's like,
I'm never getting married again.

1008
00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:25.040
A month later he's with this new check and he's living with her two months later

1009
00:58:25.041 --> 00:58:26.540
and then he's married six months later.
I'm like,

1010
00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:31.180
<v 1>what happened?
He goes,
I realize it wasn't that I didn't want to be married.</v>

1011
00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:31.421
He goes,

1012
00:58:31.421 --> 00:58:35.410
I just didn't want to be married to her because I realized like there's some

1013
00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:38.740
people out there that I get along great with.
Yeah.
And if you don't,

1014
00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:42.310
if you don't bail on a bad relationship,

1015
00:58:42.311 --> 00:58:45.700
you don't know that there's you can be and you are going to be different.

1016
00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:49.750
That's the other thing like your d I'm different with different people.

1017
00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:54.670
You're different with like you react better to certain people and certain

1018
00:58:54.671 --> 00:58:58.210
people's personalities,
you jive better with them,
you have more fun with them.

1019
00:58:58.211 --> 00:58:59.440
It's more entertaining

1020
00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:01.680
<v 2>and you get to like reintroduce yourself.</v>

1021
00:59:01.681 --> 00:59:05.060
You know the other person knows you for this like five year period of time when

1022
00:59:05.061 --> 00:59:07.610
you,
and maybe you weren't at your best,
you know,

1023
00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:10.320
and like when you've already used all your tricks.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1024
00:59:10.321 --> 00:59:12.480
Like if you give a girl diamond earrings,

1025
00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:15.420
you can never give her diamond earrings again for as long as you live.

1026
00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:15.841
You know what I mean?

1027
00:59:15.841 --> 00:59:19.650
It's like that the president is over for now and then when you get a spoon with

1028
00:59:19.651 --> 00:59:21.980
someone new,
you can,
you know it's a clean slate,

1029
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:25.670
<v 0>right?
You can impress them.
Yeah.
They haven't heard your fucking dumb stories.</v>

1030
00:59:25.671 --> 00:59:27.800
I'm gonna know that you can,
like,
you can pick all listen to this.

1031
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:29.210
Why I always tell guys,

1032
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:33.050
strive to be the person you pretend to be when you're trying to get laid.

1033
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:37.250
If you can be that person,
that real person all the time,

1034
00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:42.200
but this is very difficult to do.
But if you can be that person most of the time,

1035
00:59:42.201 --> 00:59:46.340
if not all the time,
you'll have a better life.
Yes,
I would agree with that.
Yeah.

1036
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:50.080
But it's fun to try to impress people.
It's fun when he meet someone,
I'm like,

1037
00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:55.090
boy,
wait til they see how witty I am.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's weird.
Like with me,

1038
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:55.963
I'm like,

1039
00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:59.360
I don't like when someone's just into me just because they know who I am.

1040
00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.270
If you're a famous comedian,
I'm like a little annoyed,

1041
01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:06.110
but if they have no idea who I am,
I'm also a little annoyed,
you know?
It's like,

1042
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:09.850
there should be purpose to this that I'm missing out on it.

1043
01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:13.610
Did you not Google me?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1044
01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:16.610
He's not a comedy fan was from another country.
What's going on?

1045
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:20.240
Can you imagine dating someone who didn't like comedy?
Anthony,
I love you.

1046
01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:24.770
You're amazing.
But I don't like stand up.
I mean,

1047
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.860
if it was someone who just like didn't like stand up but thought I was great,

1048
01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:31.880
I could handle it.
They didn't like standup in general,

1049
01:00:31.881 --> 01:00:36.010
but they like your material in particular.
Do you watch a lot of standup?
Me?
Yeah.

1050
01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:40.610
I watch it at the clubs.
I very rarely sit down and watch a special.
Yeah,

1051
01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:42.950
it's true.
Do you watch the special ever a case?

1052
01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:46.140
Like right now I'm working on it and trying to put together a new album or,

1053
01:00:46.141 --> 01:00:49.250
so I'm trying to go back and watch stuff,
but for years I didn't watch anything.

1054
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:51.620
Um,
uh,
but like,
it's funny,

1055
01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:56.780
like the three comics that I watch are you deleah and I'm Sebastian because I

1056
01:00:58.461 --> 01:01:00.740
follow you guys at the store.
So it's like I,

1057
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:03.740
I'm in the room sitting there and you're the only three that I watch.

1058
01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.700
Like I could like for her,

1059
01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:08.570
I could like recite your act word for word and I don't watch anyone else.

1060
01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.810
It's so funny to me.
Well I think it's great to be,

1061
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:16.670
again at a place like the store where you can see all these different styles and

1062
01:01:16.671 --> 01:01:17.960
all these different people doing it.

1063
01:01:17.961 --> 01:01:21.110
And you also see how we kind of influenced each other in the slightest bit.

1064
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:25.130
And you know that we're all working in these really hot rooms where it's all

1065
01:01:25.131 --> 01:01:28.970
packed and,
but I think it's good to sit down and watch.
You know,

1066
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.200
John Malaney when he did his world,
was that,
where was his radio city?

1067
01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.820
A city or you know,
Dave Chappelle,
wherever he did his,

1068
01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:41.900
he did his and DC I think.
Right?
The big one,
wasn't it in DC?
I the last one,

1069
01:01:41.901 --> 01:01:43.700
I think it was in la.
The last one.

1070
01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:46.880
Well he did the store with the belly room with the little one.
Oh,
the room.

1071
01:01:46.881 --> 01:01:50.270
He did another one where he's wearing like the military shirt with the CRM,

1072
01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:54.530
the Oj thing.
We talked about Oj that was in la and then there was one in Austin.

1073
01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.230
They may have been one more in DC.

1074
01:01:57.290 --> 01:02:00.560
I thought the most recent bigger one was in DC.

1075
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.360
But either way the um,
maybe you're right where,
what?
Well Jamie,
we'll find it,

1076
01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:10.070
but it's,
I think it's,
uh,
it's good to see,
you know,

1077
01:02:10.071 --> 01:02:11.510
it's good to see how different people do it.

1078
01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:15.530
I always enjoy watching Katt Williams,

1079
01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:17.660
particularly in the beginning because you know,

1080
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:21.840
like a lot of times he'll just out on stage and like he's running around on

1081
01:02:21.841 --> 01:02:25.650
stage for like five or 10 minutes before the fucking first Joe comes out and

1082
01:02:25.651 --> 01:02:28.780
he's pointing at people the audience and sweat and,
and going crazy.
It's,

1083
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.950
and it's so different than the way anybody that I know does it.

1084
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:34.260
It's good to see that too.
Yeah.
He,

1085
01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:39.261
I think the most discussed a standup special of the past year.

1086
01:02:39.511 --> 01:02:43.470
It was not in a net.
It was Kat Williams.
His,
did you see it?

1087
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:44.581
Yes.

1088
01:02:44.581 --> 01:02:47.760
The one he did from Florida where he opens up at 10 minutes of Florida material,

1089
01:02:47.761 --> 01:02:50.430
15 minutes of Jacksonville material.

1090
01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:53.100
But it's like apparently destroying that we did.
I just,

1091
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:56.280
I couldn't get enough of it.
We watched watched it a hundred times.
Yeah,

1092
01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:59.550
but it tapered off pretty hard.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1093
01:02:59.551 --> 01:03:02.850
I tapered off real hard when he was doing it.
The Trump stuff,
it's like,
wow,

1094
01:03:02.851 --> 01:03:04.500
this stuff is like half baked.
Yeah.

1095
01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:09.060
It looked like it looked like he had a bit to that they like made him cut and so

1096
01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:10.980
we had to just like do the hour anyway.

1097
01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:14.730
That's what I assume from having watched it.
That's how they do that though.

1098
01:03:14.731 --> 01:03:17.850
They don't tell you to do shit.
They don't tell me to do shit.

1099
01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:19.980
I don't think they're going to tell him to do shit.
They may have been like,

1100
01:03:19.981 --> 01:03:23.310
this is someone,
this is already a bit,
do you know what I mean?
As simple as that.

1101
01:03:23.311 --> 01:03:24.060
I don't know.

1102
01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:28.800
It seemed to me that it was almost like he had some shit to say but maybe hadn't

1103
01:03:28.801 --> 01:03:31.770
been doing a lot of stand up,
you know,

1104
01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:35.460
like I don't know how much that guy works out.
I don't see him anywhere.
No.

1105
01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:39.150
I always wonder about those guys.
Like the guys who you don't see in the clubs,

1106
01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.370
you know,
like bill,
you know,
Bill Bird saw a special one day,
um,

1107
01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:47.460
and uh,
we were doing a set together at the Ice House and uh,

1108
01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:51.510
he came into the green room,
like frothing at the mouth and then he's like,

1109
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:55.050
he goes,
the,
the fucking guy,
I forgot.
Oh,
I know who he's talking about.

1110
01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:56.010
I'll tell you later.
But he was like,

1111
01:03:56.011 --> 01:03:58.830
the fucking guy doesn't do the clubs anymore.
He doesn't do the clubs.
He goes,

1112
01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:03.570
is watching this cringy bullshit.
And he was,
he was like angry and I was like,

1113
01:04:03.571 --> 01:04:06.840
you've got to do the fucking clubs.
Yeah.
People get too comfortable,
you know,

1114
01:04:06.841 --> 01:04:08.640
it's just,
it,
it's only their fans.

1115
01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:10.920
There's preaching to the fan base and they got like,

1116
01:04:10.921 --> 01:04:14.340
Bill Maher is not changing anyone's mind.
Just like people are,

1117
01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:15.440
people are applauding their,

1118
01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:18.120
that they know they're gonna apply before they even get there.

1119
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:22.460
I would never do a comedy club.
He goes into comedy clubs at all.
No,

1120
01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:27.210
I'm sure he does not.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think you,
I think you really have to.

1121
01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:31.530
Yeah,
no,
I think so too.
Yeah.
Well,
he's in this weird category too,
right?

1122
01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.810
Where he's not just doing in comedy,
he's got to do,

1123
01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:37.530
everything has to be political because this whole thing is about political,

1124
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:42.480
political shit.
Like his show,
his,
his persona,
who he is,
you know,

1125
01:04:42.481 --> 01:04:47.360
he donated $1 million to the Democratic Party.
Like he's,
it's all politics.
Oh,

1126
01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:51.390
all of it.
And I can't stand political humor just because it's just,
it's so easy.

1127
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.500
You know,
you're either,

1128
01:04:52.501 --> 01:04:55.830
you're either making everyone mad or you're making everyone really happy,

1129
01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:00.840
but it doesn't really matter like what the joke is.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah,
yeah,

1130
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.330
yeah.
It's,
uh,

1131
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:08.190
and then if you're doing stuff about like the speaker of the house and you're

1132
01:05:08.191 --> 01:05:11.700
like,
oh my God,
it's when someone's like,
so the Mueller report,
it's like,

1133
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:14.700
fuck man.
Like,
no,
you know,

1134
01:05:14.701 --> 01:05:18.700
who's like super deep into politics on the right is nick depaulo like every time

1135
01:05:18.701 --> 01:05:23.330
I talk to him.
Yeah.
And what's the talk about the fucking Steele dossier.
Yeah,

1136
01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:28.300
yeah,
yeah.
Let's talk about all this different,
all the Shit Obama did.
Wow.

1137
01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:31.230
How about when Obama did this?
Well,
yeah.
How do you know?
Yeah,

1138
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:34.150
I don't even know this.
I know the,
the,
the,
the knowledge of it.

1139
01:05:34.151 --> 01:05:38.490
Like I once got a phone call,
like before the last election,
I get,
you know,

1140
01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.500
get a year ago.
And they're like,
we want to ask you about like,

1141
01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:45.150
how involved would you say are you with politics?
And I'm like,
very action.

1142
01:05:45.151 --> 01:05:49.750
I'm pretty passionate right now.
Um,
and like how,
how informed would you say you,

1143
01:05:49.751 --> 01:05:52.540
I'm like,
I'm,
I'm attempt,
very informed.
And they're like,
okay.

1144
01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:55.720
And they start asking me questions and I did not know what the fuck they were

1145
01:05:55.721 --> 01:05:58.990
talking about.
Like I hadn't heard of any of these things.
Any of these bills.

1146
01:05:58.991 --> 01:06:01.600
Like I have no idea.
I have no idea what's going on.

1147
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:04.510
It's like the difference between a casual sports fan and someone who really

1148
01:06:04.511 --> 01:06:09.090
understands all the drafts and all the pics from different colleges and all with

1149
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.960
this guy's got potential and this guy needs to work on this defense.

1150
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:16.780
This is a 40 times.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
The people who know the combined numbers.

1151
01:06:16.781 --> 01:06:21.310
Yeah.
He bench pressed two 24 or 47 times.
Just people that know that stuff.

1152
01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:26.980
It's exhausting because it,
it,
it's so involved.
Like you have to,

1153
01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:29.710
if you really want to be paying attention to everything that's going on with

1154
01:06:29.711 --> 01:06:31.570
Nancy Pelosi,
you know,
you gotta,

1155
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:34.030
you gotta be paying attention to that all day long.

1156
01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:38.470
And most of the people that do that,
they're nuts.
Like you're,
you're,
it's just,

1157
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:42.160
it's like sports.
It's sports,
but in a different way.
Like you're just there.

1158
01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:46.270
This is the thing that you're wrapped up in [inaudible] although it does shape

1159
01:06:46.271 --> 01:06:49.390
our world,
you know?
Yeah.
As a,

1160
01:06:49.391 --> 01:06:52.930
as like right wing comics go though does not a lot.

1161
01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:56.530
I'm like Nick Dipaolo is that king because he's actually really fucking funny.

1162
01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:00.610
Like he's right wing as like a person and you know,

1163
01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:03.940
he's conservative but he's also a great standup comedian.

1164
01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:08.500
But did he get more right?
Yes.
As he got older.
Yeah.
So it wasn't all always,

1165
01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:11.370
cause I remember Depaulo he's one of my favorites.
Uh,
you know,

1166
01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:16.230
when I would see him on TV as a kid and I know I'm a little bit now,
but uh,
the,

1167
01:07:16.231 --> 01:07:20.410
the,
the right thing seem to come up more and more in the past 10 years.
Yeah.

1168
01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:22.090
He was always an angry guy,

1169
01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:28.020
but he became like an old angry guy that's really into politics as he got older.

1170
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:33.910
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean I guess part of it is like,

1171
01:07:33.911 --> 01:07:36.520
it works for him.
Like it's,
people love to hear it.

1172
01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:38.890
Like there's not a lot of those guys,

1173
01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:44.700
like who is the right have to bank on in terms of like comics that they could go

1174
01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:48.730
see Tim Allen barely.

1175
01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:51.760
Does he do standup anymore?
I think he does.
Like,

1176
01:07:51.761 --> 01:07:54.910
I think it goes up to the laugh factory.
Does it?
Yeah.
Okay.

1177
01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.490
So maybe he's one of those guys that like when was the last time you want to say

1178
01:07:57.491 --> 01:08:00.610
six months ago,
you know what I mean?
Oh yeah.
You know what I mean?
I don't,

1179
01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:03.340
I don't know,
maybe I'm wrong,
but who else?
Okay,

1180
01:08:03.341 --> 01:08:07.840
so you got Tim Allen and Nick Depaulo.
It's gotta be more,
there must be,

1181
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:13.710
I mean Norton kind of leans right a little bit more libertarian,

1182
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:18.140
but he doesn't do a lot of politic jokes.
He'll talk about it.

1183
01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:20.480
But what the fuck else is like no one.

1184
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:24.260
But if you wanted it like left wing comedians so you could start with Michelle

1185
01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:27.290
Wolf and work your way up.
Oh yeah,
there's,
there's millions of them.

1186
01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.920
Michelle Wolf wasn't even like left wing.
I think the correspondents' dinner,

1187
01:08:30.921 --> 01:08:34.430
everyone's like,
this is a star making turn.
And I think it almost ruined her.

1188
01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:38.930
Really?
Like,
yes,
because her show Netflix was called the break.

1189
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:40.730
Like it was called the break and was like,

1190
01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:44.450
we're going to take a break from all of this and just talk about like other

1191
01:08:44.451 --> 01:08:47.180
things going on in the world.
We don't need to be focused on politics.

1192
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.940
And after that,
after the correspondence dinner,

1193
01:08:49.941 --> 01:08:54.230
it was like Dee opening show was like her going after Sarah Huckabee Sanders and

1194
01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:59.190
you're like,
oh,
you,
you got forced into this niche.
Yeah.

1195
01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:01.123
Yeah.

1196
01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:06.940
It's tricky if you find a thing that like works and then people like you should

1197
01:09:07.191 --> 01:09:08.180
really concentrate on that.

1198
01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:10.640
Like I remember Jamie Masada gave her a friend of mine,
uh,

1199
01:09:10.641 --> 01:09:12.470
advice once way back in the day.
He's like,

1200
01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.940
you should be generation x guy when you go onstage or should be,

1201
01:09:16.941 --> 01:09:20.300
I'm from generation x any time,
you know,

1202
01:09:20.301 --> 01:09:24.860
like my generation generation x think this and talk like that.

1203
01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:28.100
But he was giving him advice and I was like,
listen to me,
don't listen to that.

1204
01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:32.360
Has Jimmy massage ever given good advice?
I don't know.
As Tiffany Haddish,

1205
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:36.350
she's still mad.
He manages it.
Right.
So He's,
he's doing something right.

1206
01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:40.910
He's manages,
sir.
Yeah.
Like recently I actually fired everybody.

1207
01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:45.650
Maybe she fired him too.
Yeah.
I don't know.
She's a wild woman.

1208
01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:49.910
She can do whatever the fuck she wants now,
you know?
But you know,

1209
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:53.960
I'm so happy for her.
I knew her when the shit wasn't going well.
You know?

1210
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:58.700
She's always been wild though.
She's a wild person,
she seems like.
Yeah.

1211
01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:00.470
In a good way.
Like Hey.
Yeah,

1212
01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:03.140
just one of the two people that I saw like onstage was like,
oh,

1213
01:10:03.141 --> 01:10:05.360
you're going to be a star.
Like I didn't know anything about her,

1214
01:10:05.361 --> 01:10:07.290
but I was just like,
you just start.

1215
01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:10.310
Was it when she was creeping into the microphone?
No.
No,

1216
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:13.430
it was not that you ever seen her do that?
No.
Dude,

1217
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:18.430
she can make the most ungodly sounds with her vagina.
Like for real?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1218
01:10:18.431 --> 01:10:19.850
Yeah.
She takes the microphone.

1219
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.470
She puts it on her pussy and goes like she knows how to do it.

1220
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:25.280
She has,

1221
01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:30.210
apparently she has an ability to make a noise with a vagina on cue thing.

1222
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:34.790
Actually,
I did go before her.
If I had to follow that,

1223
01:10:34.791 --> 01:10:39.140
I'd be fear in front of six people.
Can I get a new mic?

1224
01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:43.630
Yeah.
I followed her before.
I didn't even think about it.
I probably should have.

1225
01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.260
Yeah,
I figured like the genes or filter enough.
Yeah.
You hope so.
Yeah,
we'd hope.

1226
01:10:48.730 --> 01:10:50.180
Yeah.
It's still,
it's not ideal.

1227
01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:55.360
You like that type of personally thought wild personality that like a Gallach

1228
01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:59.450
has that has like,
what the fuck else could she have done other than stand up.

1229
01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:04.390
I Dunno,
but there's a lot of those people out there that never find stand up.

1230
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:07.940
Oh Shit.
Then life just becomes chaos.
Like the crazy person at the office,

1231
01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:10.270
you know,
it's just stuck there and the,

1232
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:13.380
you get fired from enough of those jobs where you can't even get that office job

1233
01:11:13.381 --> 01:11:13.980
anymore because

1234
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.580
<v 1>you know the word gets out.
Oh yeah.
Don't hire Tiffany.
That crazy bitch.</v>

1235
01:11:17.581 --> 01:11:20.280
She's never going to be there.
And when she is there,

1236
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.160
she's going to Queef into the fucking loud speaker.

1237
01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:25.940
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

1238
01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:30.040
<v 1>Wish.
I mean,
part of me says no,</v>

1239
01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.520
I don't wish that there was like some sort of an organized program to get into

1240
01:11:33.521 --> 01:11:36.640
comedy because figuring it out,
I figured it out.
You figured it out.

1241
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:40.540
All of us did.
But then part of me says,
man,
there's so many kids out there,

1242
01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:45.660
there's probably a 16 year old kid right now who sees the hypocrisy in all the

1243
01:11:46.061 --> 01:11:49.570
things that these adults are doing.
And He fucking hates class.

1244
01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:52.180
And he's sitting there right now going nuts.

1245
01:11:52.181 --> 01:11:56.920
Or there's a girl who's feeling the same way about our stupid friends and her

1246
01:11:56.921 --> 01:12:00.110
mom and all these fucking people that want her to be a certain way.

1247
01:12:00.111 --> 01:12:03.870
And she's like,
Jesus Christ,
I gotta get the fuck away from these people.
And,

1248
01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:07.870
and she makes her friends laugh,
but nobody ever tells her,
hey listen to me.

1249
01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.780
You could do this.
You could talk shit about things.

1250
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:12.700
Like you could be a really funny comedian.

1251
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.060
Like you've got to figure out a way to do that.
Nobody does that.
Like you,
you,

1252
01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.190
it's so it,
the,
the number of people that have the,

1253
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:23.290
like how many people have you ever met in your life that have the potential to

1254
01:12:23.291 --> 01:12:26.380
be a comic but never did it?
Like when you're around them,
you're like,
damn,

1255
01:12:26.381 --> 01:12:28.440
this guy is funny.
Cause I'm gonna comment

1256
01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.460
<v 0>five or six,
you know,</v>

1257
01:12:29.461 --> 01:12:34.461
there are people who are like as funny as me in college who just went on and got

1258
01:12:34.531 --> 01:12:38.850
jobs and I got funnier.
You know,
like I knew people like that are people.

1259
01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:41.550
One of the funniest guys I've ever met in my life was like a,

1260
01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:45.360
was like an executive producers Pa,
but he was so goddamn funny.

1261
01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:46.530
I couldn't believe it.
But he like,

1262
01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:49.140
I don't think it would have translated to the stage.
There's something like,

1263
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:53.190
there's something you have to figure out in yourself to become a good community.

1264
01:12:53.191 --> 01:12:56.730
And if you're the funniest guy in the world,
yes.
You know,
it's a different,

1265
01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:00.900
it's a different muscle,
you know?
Yeah.
But I,

1266
01:13:00.901 --> 01:13:02.970
and I like that there's so many different ways to do it.

1267
01:13:02.971 --> 01:13:07.320
Like I started in La and people like,
you should not start in la.
Yeah,

1268
01:13:07.630 --> 01:13:08.463
Ari did too.

1269
01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.280
I think it helped me because it was like you had to get good right away.
Well,

1270
01:13:11.281 --> 01:13:14.400
Ari,
Ari did open mikes in DC at first,

1271
01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:17.370
but then basically started out in la when I met him.

1272
01:13:17.371 --> 01:13:21.750
He was a doorman at the comedy store in or just a raw open miker yeah,

1273
01:13:21.751 --> 01:13:25.320
it's hard to,
it's hard to start out in la,
but it can be done.
Especially now,

1274
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.860
especially,
we don't know any better,
you know,
like I,
I didn't,

1275
01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.280
I found out like years after I'd started in La that you should not start in la.

1276
01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:34.830
Yeah.
And it wasn't like I was going to move and go.

1277
01:13:34.831 --> 01:13:36.900
I was already living here when I decided to do stand up,

1278
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:41.520
but I wasn't going to like move to Chicago,
uh,
and start there.
Yeah.

1279
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:45.570
Some people do and they know it doesn't seem to work.
No.

1280
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:50.520
I don't know anybody who's ever moved from La to like a satellite community like

1281
01:13:50.521 --> 01:13:54.660
Denver or somewhere like that,
unless they were already really established.

1282
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:57.150
I don't know anybody who was starting out who moved somewhere where it worked

1283
01:13:57.151 --> 01:14:02.050
out well,
no,
they always,
they come back or like to go to Austin.
I'm like,

1284
01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.050
I'm going to try it out there.
And it's like,
it doesn't,

1285
01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:09.300
you're just starting over.
Yeah.
You got to start there.
There's,
yeah,

1286
01:14:09.630 --> 01:14:11.590
there's no right or wrong way to do it,
but man,

1287
01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:16.591
it would be nice if somebody sort of collected thoughts on how like what to do

1288
01:14:18.641 --> 01:14:21.640
and what not to do.
Yeah.
Like some people are like,
oh,
you got to get in the road.

1289
01:14:21.641 --> 01:14:25.060
Just get on the road and like,
and it's like,
no,
that's,
that's not great advice.

1290
01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:28.550
If you're doing see rooms,
it just going to make you hate the road.
Right.

1291
01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:31.600
I've seen people who just look like worn through that.

1292
01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:35.080
Like they're just like every night they're going up and they're either like,

1293
01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:38.140
I have to be like a crowd pleaser because the person's just coming to see
comedy.

1294
01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:42.160
Like I'm so lucky people come to see Anthony Jeselnik and not just a comedy show

1295
01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.360
because that's,
that can be brutal and painful and a lot of people who were like,

1296
01:14:46.361 --> 01:14:48.520
no,
just get in the road and then their act suffers.

1297
01:14:48.521 --> 01:14:51.700
They had this like hackey act all the sudden because they had to do it like
that.

1298
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:56.740
He would kiss me like serious anxiety when I find out that someone got a Vegas

1299
01:14:56.741 --> 01:15:01.630
residency,
I go,
how many nights a week?

1300
01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:06.040
Six,
six nights a week at the stratosphere.

1301
01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.630
It sounds,
I mean,

1302
01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.550
someone told me David spade was thinking about doing one and he went to go see

1303
01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:15.490
Louis Anderson who was doing one this before baskets and he was like,

1304
01:15:15.491 --> 01:15:16.990
it was just the saddest thing I've ever seen.

1305
01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.500
That was a Carlin's last stand was a Vegas residency.

1306
01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:24.400
Did he have a Vegas residency?
Yeah.
Where was he at?
I forget where he was,

1307
01:15:24.401 --> 01:15:28.300
but he had like a meltdown where he like went off on the crowd,

1308
01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:31.900
just like talk to calling them all pieces of shit.
Really.
And Yeah.

1309
01:15:31.901 --> 01:15:35.710
And then had to go to rehab was like,
I'm,
I'm addicted to painkillers like,

1310
01:15:35.711 --> 01:15:39.520
and an unlucky ever.
I don't if he ever performed again.
Well,

1311
01:15:39.521 --> 01:15:42.490
he died before he died.

1312
01:15:43.090 --> 01:15:46.420
He was performing when he died.
I mean,

1313
01:15:46.421 --> 01:15:48.730
I think he was at a hotel,

1314
01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.000
I'm pretty sure he was sleeping in a hotel,

1315
01:15:52.001 --> 01:15:54.490
that he was performing it when he died.
I would believe that,

1316
01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.720
but I didn't because I had done that last special he did was terrible.

1317
01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:01.880
Where he's like reading half of it.
Oh,
I didn't see that.
It was,
it was,

1318
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.540
it was just like a,
you know,
a swan song for him.

1319
01:16:04.541 --> 01:16:07.510
But I think that was after the Vegas residency.
So must have been doing more.

1320
01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:11.980
Yeah,
his schedule was very,
very hectic and unusual.

1321
01:16:11.981 --> 01:16:13.960
He was doing one hour a year,

1322
01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:18.190
an hour specialty would film and he would write it all out.

1323
01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.520
Like he would write it all out and then tweak it a little bit.

1324
01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:25.750
But it was more of a monologue than it was like set up punchline jokes.

1325
01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:28.390
And he seemed to be,

1326
01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:34.260
he was falling into this more like a sort of more of a social commentator in

1327
01:16:34.721 --> 01:16:38.990
some aspects than he was a standup towards the end.
You know what I mean?
Oh yeah.

1328
01:16:39.190 --> 01:16:40.080
Someone told me that he,

1329
01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:43.750
a lot of the reason he did an hour every year was because a,

1330
01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.650
it like tax problems and the IRS has come out of hard.
And,
uh,

1331
01:16:47.651 --> 01:16:50.320
so we had to be working that much and it kind of made a miserable,

1332
01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:54.520
you know the story about his nine 11 story,
right.

1333
01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:59.770
Um,
tell me where he recorded a special called.

1334
01:16:59.771 --> 01:17:01.950
I kind of like it when a lot of people die.

1335
01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:06.460
That was the name of the special and he has this whole closes with a big long 20

1336
01:17:06.461 --> 01:17:09.030
minute thing about like when he hears about people dying,
he'd,

1337
01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:13.340
the more the better.
And he filmed it on like September 10th,

1338
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:17.690
and then the next day came in and was like,
we've got,
we've got to cancel this,

1339
01:17:17.691 --> 01:17:21.080
but no one can ever see this or hear this and now you can get the album.

1340
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:23.440
But even in the album he's reading it,
they like it.

1341
01:17:23.441 --> 01:17:26.960
They destroyed the actual footage from the taping.
Oh really?
Yeah.

1342
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:31.730
They destroyed it.
Oh,
he was just like,
there's no one can ever see this.
Wow.

1343
01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.880
Recorded in Vegas at the MGM Grand on September 9th and 10th.

1344
01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:41.450
September 9th and 10th.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
What was it called?

1345
01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:46.910
I kind of like him.
A lot of people die.
Jesus Christ.

1346
01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:51.590
He must've woken up the morning of September 11th and going,

1347
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:54.710
did I manifest this?
Yeah,
look at that.

1348
01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:58.400
I kind of like it when a lot of people die.
And so the audio CD,

1349
01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:03.380
it's just him talking.
It's like him working out the,
uh,

1350
01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:03.861
wait a minute.

1351
01:18:03.861 --> 01:18:08.861
It says streaming audio streaming with Amazon prime's so there's no video of it

1352
01:18:09.341 --> 01:18:11.800
on,
I'll look to see if there is some,

1353
01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:16.640
some person who works somewhere might have preserved it.
I mean,

1354
01:18:16.641 --> 01:18:18.230
I feel like I would've heard about it.
I mean,
like I said,

1355
01:18:18.231 --> 01:18:21.000
I listened to the bit and it's,
if he's like,
I've got to read this,

1356
01:18:21.001 --> 01:18:24.680
this is how I do it.
So it's like a very early version of it.
But,
uh,

1357
01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:26.680
it's not great.
But I mean,
I can't,

1358
01:18:26.710 --> 01:18:31.640
I can't even imagine taping a special on September 10th he had some dark moments

1359
01:18:31.641 --> 01:18:32.474
in his career.

1360
01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:37.720
I took some friends to see him in 1988 at the Hampton Beach Casino.

1361
01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:42.920
I think that's what it was called in Hampton Beach,
New Hampshire.

1362
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:46.790
It was like a place where people would go up for vacation and we went to see a

1363
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:51.080
George Carlin there way back in the day and he always had the same opening act

1364
01:18:51.081 --> 01:18:53.900
and the same opening.
I kind of knew even back then cause I was,

1365
01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:57.130
I guess I was an open miker then I was just starting out.
Um,

1366
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:58.610
I knew there were certain guys,

1367
01:18:58.611 --> 01:19:02.270
he took people on the road with them that were terrible that they took people on

1368
01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:04.790
the road with him that just didn't,
they weren't good comics,

1369
01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:07.670
but they made them look like heroes and they did it because they were friends

1370
01:19:07.671 --> 01:19:10.610
with them or because they just wanted to have like the worst comic ever go up

1371
01:19:10.611 --> 01:19:14.600
before that.
It's a good question.
You know,
you'd have to,

1372
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:15.830
I guess it would vary,

1373
01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.790
but for sure there's certain comics that like it when people go on in front of

1374
01:19:19.791 --> 01:19:23.030
them suck.
They do,
they,
they want that.
You know,

1375
01:19:23.031 --> 01:19:26.000
there's certain comics that you see them taking people on the road and you look

1376
01:19:26.001 --> 01:19:29.180
at it,
you're like,
what the fuck?
You're taking that guy with you?
Like,

1377
01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:33.860
what are you doing?
Why,
why are you torturing people like that?
Yeah.
But,
uh,

1378
01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:38.330
the opening acted better than George.
He had terrible set.

1379
01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:42.420
He had this whole rant that he was doing,
cause he was like,

1380
01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:45.290
he had an unquestionably one of the greatest comics of all time,

1381
01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.900
but he had hours that were just not good.

1382
01:19:47.901 --> 01:19:51.350
And there was a period of time where it seemed like he just missed it.

1383
01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:55.220
Like it was like it was missing whether it was his personal life was off or

1384
01:19:55.221 --> 01:19:58.940
whatever it was.
But he had this whole rant that was like,

1385
01:19:58.941 --> 01:20:01.100
fuck this.
And he was like,

1386
01:20:01.101 --> 01:20:05.780
and fuck Israel and fuck comedy clubs.
Like he was saying,
fuck comedy clubs.

1387
01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:08.070
Like this is like this whole bit.
And he was reading it off of

1388
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:12.810
<v 1>a yellow legal pad and the whore is like standing there like not understanding</v>

1389
01:20:12.811 --> 01:20:17.010
like where this was going.
Like we're waiting for the jokes,
where's the hilarity?

1390
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:20.550
Whereas the,
and it wasn't,
it just didn't exist.
And my friends were mad at me,

1391
01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:24.660
how can I take it?
I had taken them from where we live.

1392
01:20:24.661 --> 01:20:29.630
We lived in revere and we all drove all the way up to New Hampshire.
Like,
yeah,

1393
01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.550
we're going to go see George Collins is going to be awesome.
And it was terrible.

1394
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:33.620
<v 2>It's funny,</v>

1395
01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:38.450
I remember Louis C K and like an interview years ago was talking about how he

1396
01:20:38.451 --> 01:20:41.870
took the pressure,
came off of him to always have a good show.

1397
01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.030
But you said audience members love sang.

1398
01:20:44.031 --> 01:20:48.830
I saw George Carlin once and he was awesome.
But they really love saying,

1399
01:20:48.831 --> 01:20:52.480
you know,
I saw Carlin once and he was horrible.
Like they,

1400
01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:57.520
they still get the experience and the story of it and that it's theirs forever.

1401
01:20:57.690 --> 01:21:00.440
I don't have to worry about doing a bad,
it's better though.

1402
01:21:00.441 --> 01:21:05.030
If they say you were funny.
I think it's,
I think to see a legend bomb would be,

1403
01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:08.270
uh,
would be great.
Well,

1404
01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:10.400
<v 1>if you are a and fan,
you got to see those.</v>

1405
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:14.270
If you went to see him live a bunch of times,
yeah,
he had those rough spots,
man.

1406
01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.660
You know,
it's,
um,
it's one of those things,

1407
01:21:17.661 --> 01:21:20.930
if you're going to do an hour of standup every year,

1408
01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:26.450
you can have some rough ones.
There's just no way around that.
Oh,
100%.

1409
01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:30.620
It seems like that's just,
I mean it can be done.

1410
01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.750
I think it can be done.
I mean,

1411
01:21:32.751 --> 01:21:37.550
I think you can put together like I'm six months in from my last special,

1412
01:21:37.730 --> 01:21:40.370
I think I could do another special in six months,

1413
01:21:40.371 --> 01:21:43.280
but it wouldn't be as good as my last one,
I don't think.
Yeah,

1414
01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:47.870
I just don't think it would,
I just think you need time.
Yeah.
One a year.

1415
01:21:47.871 --> 01:21:48.704
It's crazy.

1416
01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.080
<v 2>One of yours.
It's insane.
Like the,</v>

1417
01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:53.250
the guys like Jimmy Carr who while they're touring,

1418
01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.820
they're writing jokes and just putting them away.
So at the end of the tour,

1419
01:21:56.821 --> 01:21:57.660
when they taped the special,

1420
01:21:57.661 --> 01:22:02.400
they have all these jokes they can go through and look at and then start the new

1421
01:22:02.401 --> 01:22:07.380
tour from that.
That seems like I like to sit in my set,
you know what I mean?

1422
01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:11.190
I just want to be focused on that and not always be writing the next thing,

1423
01:22:11.191 --> 01:22:12.600
but some people who were just like,

1424
01:22:12.601 --> 01:22:15.480
I'm just going to go up and talk and then see it happening a lot now.

1425
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.030
I think with like the prevalence of Netflix specials,

1426
01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:21.240
people just want the money and they're famous enough they can just go up and

1427
01:22:21.241 --> 01:22:24.000
just get through it.
I'm like,
this is your legacy.

1428
01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:26.400
Like why would you want to put out a bad special ever?

1429
01:22:26.401 --> 01:22:29.100
I don't care what they're paying you make sure it's great

1430
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:33.950
<v 1>the same way and I feel like those people that watched that,
when you do do that,</v>

1431
01:22:33.951 --> 01:22:36.110
man,
if you don't acknowledge that you fucked them over,

1432
01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:39.650
they're never going to trust you again.
If you don't say,
hey look,

1433
01:22:39.651 --> 01:22:42.740
that one wasn't a good special.
I gave it a shot.
It just wasn't right.

1434
01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:43.880
It didn't come out right.

1435
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:48.170
I thought it was pretty good and then the taping didn't go well and if you don't

1436
01:22:48.171 --> 01:22:50.060
do that,
they're not going to listen to you man.
They were like,

1437
01:22:50.061 --> 01:22:54.650
this is my best work.
Like this is,
Oh,
this is your best work.
Yeah,
well the fuck

1438
01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.260
<v 2>you can like fold them once.
And I mean like if I want,</v>

1439
01:22:57.261 --> 01:23:00.980
if I went on tour right now and just did the same material from the special,

1440
01:23:00.981 --> 01:23:04.190
like people would be like,
okay,
but they're not coming back the next time.

1441
01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:08.380
You know they're gonna get mad at you.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1442
01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:12.460
When you do a special,
once it's on Netflix,
you're done with that material,

1443
01:23:12.461 --> 01:23:16.180
it's over done.
I think people don't,
I try not even to remember it.

1444
01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:17.940
Like I'm an idiot in the way that I teach.

1445
01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:22.980
I like assumed that the entire audience has seen everything I've ever done good.

1446
01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.430
Like I really do think that.
And it's like,

1447
01:23:24.431 --> 01:23:26.980
even if it's one guy in the back of was like,
I've heard these before,

1448
01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:30.880
no one else has heard it.
It's still drives me crazy that I can't,
I don't know.

1449
01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:35.440
It's,
I've got too much pride.
I have the same feeling and I'll say sometimes too.

1450
01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:38.350
And here's like if something comes up,
I go,

1451
01:23:38.351 --> 01:23:41.140
I have an old bid on this and I'll say the bit,

1452
01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:44.710
but I'll let them know this is an old bit like this.
This is,
you know,

1453
01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:49.600
I got this old bit.
Yeah.
Some books.
Some people though,
they,

1454
01:23:49.601 --> 01:23:53.110
when someone comes to see you,
like Jim Gaffigan,
they want,

1455
01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:55.930
if they don't see hot pockets,
oh they get fucking mad.

1456
01:23:56.020 --> 01:24:00.700
I saw Gaffigan and Toronto a couple of years ago and he did killer hour,

1457
01:24:00.730 --> 01:24:04.720
just walks out,
does the hour,
says thank you,
good night walks off stage,

1458
01:24:04.721 --> 01:24:07.720
walks right back on and does hot pockets.

1459
01:24:07.730 --> 01:24:10.930
Doesn't ask who wants to your hot pockets.
Just goes right into it.

1460
01:24:10.931 --> 01:24:14.170
Does the whole 10 minute thing and then says good night and walks off stage.

1461
01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:16.960
Well,
Burke crises that way with the machine,

1462
01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:20.350
like he has to tell that fucking story.
Yeah.
Even though people see it,

1463
01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:23.140
they want to see it live.
Yeah.
He's trapped.

1464
01:24:23.530 --> 01:24:26.200
And maybe if I had more stories I could get away with it.

1465
01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:30.700
But once you hear the joke,
you know it's,
it's over.

1466
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:36.100
It doesn't,
it doesn't work again.
Yeah.
Seinfeld still does,
old,
old stuff,

1467
01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:41.440
does really old stuff and he's done two specials of old stuff that he's like,

1468
01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:46.030
he's already put on specials.
I went and saw him at the palladium,
uh,

1469
01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.930
about a year or two ago and it was one of the worst shows I've ever seen.

1470
01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.830
Like I had like a splitting headache and I was like furious really.

1471
01:24:53.890 --> 01:24:57.400
And one of my friends in another comic that I respect a lot gave him a standing

1472
01:24:57.401 --> 01:25:00.160
ovation and I was like,
are you fucking kidding me?
And he was like,

1473
01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:03.880
I understand why you feel the way you do,
but I just love seeing the act.

1474
01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:04.960
And I was like,
I couldn't believe it.

1475
01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:07.780
And then I saw Seinfeld again at cluster fest.

1476
01:25:08.110 --> 01:25:11.860
He was in the big outdoor stage with a bunch of like for kids completely

1477
01:25:11.861 --> 01:25:15.310
different hour and murdered like destroyed.
Then it was like,

1478
01:25:15.311 --> 01:25:19.980
he has like corny stuff depending on what the audience,
you know,

1479
01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.390
is if everyone's sitting there wearing a Yamaka,

1480
01:25:22.570 --> 01:25:26.170
he's got one act and if it's a bunch of kids he's got and he's got a cool hip

1481
01:25:26.171 --> 01:25:30.250
act.
Really?
Yeah.
So you went to the Amika crowd?
Yeah.

1482
01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:33.760
Interesting.
What was bad about that?

1483
01:25:34.450 --> 01:25:39.450
It was a aggressively corny and just really corny is a funny phrase.

1484
01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:44.890
A good like you would like.
Thank you for coming to the show.
I know,
you know,

1485
01:25:44.891 --> 01:25:46.720
we were like,
should we go to the show?
Should we go?

1486
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:49.010
Should we go to the shows we get?
Did we nuber throughout?

1487
01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:50.860
How did we get to the show?
Do we really want to get it down?
I'm like,

1488
01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:54.190
I can't believe he's doing this right now.
But people were eating it up.

1489
01:25:54.191 --> 01:25:56.880
Like everyone around me was going nuts and loving it.
Uh,

1490
01:25:57.130 --> 01:26:00.690
but it was just like old man corny.
Oh Man.

1491
01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:04.070
Could you see Seinfeld on like a talk show?
And

1492
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.650
<v 0>he's like mean kind of biting and you're like,
oh,
this is great.
Like,</v>

1493
01:26:06.651 --> 01:26:10.190
he's hilarious.
And I expected more of that,
but when I saw him cluster fest,

1494
01:26:10.191 --> 01:26:14.150
I got that.
You know what his cluster fest,
it's uh,
it's,

1495
01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:18.180
uh,
it's the third year.
This year.
The festival in San Francisco.

1496
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:22.880
It's a comedy central and Coachella together put together a thing.

1497
01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:27.920
It's all comedy,
a comedy,
music,
listen,
music teacher,
whenever I see festivals,

1498
01:26:27.921 --> 01:26:31.300
I was assume someone's getting ripped off.
That's what I think my,

1499
01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:33.950
my impression is or who's getting the money,
who's,

1500
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:36.680
who's getting the money out of this.
That's how I feel about like Montreal.

1501
01:26:36.710 --> 01:26:38.660
But there's the occasional no big a festival.
You're like,

1502
01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:42.980
okay this much for for like one show in Toronto.
Like yeah,

1503
01:26:42.981 --> 01:26:46.820
I'm totally in.
I'm totally,
so sometimes it's great and sometimes it's nothing.

1504
01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:48.320
Yeah,
the just for laughs thing.

1505
01:26:48.710 --> 01:26:52.910
My issue with that is I got in when I was a zero.

1506
01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:57.230
Like I got an adjustable apps when I was four years into comedy.

1507
01:26:57.231 --> 01:27:00.740
I think five,
I was terrible.
You know,

1508
01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:04.580
I had like a 10 minute set that I could do and it could get some laughs,

1509
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:09.710
but I became a part of just for laughs.
Like when it was helping me,

1510
01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:10.790
I wasn't helping it.

1511
01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:16.240
But then when I see festivals where I see like a lot of names on a thing and I'm

1512
01:27:16.461 --> 01:27:20.240
like,
well,
who's funding this?
Like sponsored by southwest airlines.
So like,

1513
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:24.740
well what is this weird corporate mishmash that you've put together and who's

1514
01:27:24.741 --> 01:27:27.530
profiting off of this?
Like it's not the comedians.

1515
01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:30.620
Like I get why you put it all together,
but then you find out how much,

1516
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:33.440
how much the comedians are getting like well where's the rest of the money
going?

1517
01:27:33.710 --> 01:27:37.130
There's a lot of money in that audience is a big place.
Yeah.
You know,

1518
01:27:37.190 --> 01:27:40.430
just some are better than others,
but like,
and sometimes they're just like,

1519
01:27:40.431 --> 01:27:43.340
we're going to take a loss of,
the sponsors are going to lose money on this,

1520
01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:46.730
but we're going to like that riot fest in La,
they would do every year.

1521
01:27:46.830 --> 01:27:47.571
It's done now.

1522
01:27:47.571 --> 01:27:50.450
But did it like four or five years in a row and it never made money.

1523
01:27:50.451 --> 01:27:55.110
It was a comedy festival in downtown La.
Really?
Yeah.
See that's how much I,

1524
01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:56.630
I haven't version of those things.

1525
01:27:56.631 --> 01:27:58.970
I don't even know when they're taking place cause I say no to everything.

1526
01:27:58.971 --> 01:28:02.780
I'm like,
no,
you're not just priced out of it.
No.
It's like people are like,

1527
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:04.640
oh I don't,
I haven't done the college in years.

1528
01:28:04.641 --> 01:28:06.320
And it's not like I've got a problem with colleges.

1529
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:07.610
It's just like they can't afford,

1530
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.590
well I stopped doing colleges when they could afford me cause I just would just,

1531
01:28:12.730 --> 01:28:15.560
I'd be performing in front of 18 year olds.
I'd be like,
this is ridiculous.

1532
01:28:15.561 --> 01:28:20.120
I just like,
there's too many of them that don't have life experience.
They're,

1533
01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:24.230
they're growing minds and you can make them laugh at some things but they

1534
01:28:24.231 --> 01:28:26.450
haven't experienced what I like.

1535
01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.600
It's like I'm happily married but if I wasn't,

1536
01:28:29.630 --> 01:28:34.010
I'd like a chick was a little bitter.
I like a older chick.
Keeps yourself fit.

1537
01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:36.980
These experienced a lot in life.
Who understands?

1538
01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:40.490
She understands that life is up and down.
There's hardships.

1539
01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:45.140
I'm not interested in anyone who's young and delusional and bubbly.
Yeah,

1540
01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:49.400
no.
So that when you go to perform in front of 18 year olds,

1541
01:28:49.401 --> 01:28:53.930
like they have this like this delusional version of what the world should be and

1542
01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:59.440
social justice and all these ideas about the economy and all these ideas about

1543
01:28:59.691 --> 01:29:01.620
socialism and all these ideas.
I don't like,

1544
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:05.550
<v 2>I'm exhausted already.
I can't,
I can't do this.
I still think it's fun.</v>

1545
01:29:05.670 --> 01:29:07.800
I think it's fun to watch them just be like,
Holy Shit,

1546
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:09.480
you don't have to do one show.
You know what I mean?

1547
01:29:11.090 --> 01:29:14.910
Maybe they can leave if they want.
I don't feel any pressure.

1548
01:29:15.190 --> 01:29:18.810
I mean casinos more than more than,
uh,
colleges.

1549
01:29:18.811 --> 01:29:22.410
But I loved like even if one bad,
it was an interesting bat and you're,

1550
01:29:22.411 --> 01:29:25.200
and you're getting paid so much money that you're like,
I don't care.

1551
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:28.740
I don't care how this goes.
And I've,
I've had some go real,

1552
01:29:28.741 --> 01:29:31.920
I used to go to the college and say,
uh,
what should I not talk about?

1553
01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.920
And then whatever they said I would open with that and it,

1554
01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:40.290
and it worked every time.
Except Colorado School of mines.
What does that,

1555
01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:45.000
the Colorado School of mines is like a um,
it's a engineering school.

1556
01:29:45.650 --> 01:29:50.400
Yeah,
School of mines.
Mines.
Yeah.
It's a famous m I.
N e or m.

1557
01:29:50.401 --> 01:29:55.170
I.
N.
D.
M.
I.
N.
E.
O.
Like digging.
I thought you were saying mine's too.

1558
01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:58.590
I was with Joe
and I,

1559
01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:02.220
they said do not talk about abortion.
And I was like,
okay.

1560
01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:05.610
And I went up and open wounds and abortion joke and then died for an hour.

1561
01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:09.330
Like they never forgave me.
I just completely ate shit.

1562
01:30:10.130 --> 01:30:12.960
Was it a good abortion joke?
I assume

1563
01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:18.690
to have it a bad abortion joke is like if you're going to tell I have a joke

1564
01:30:18.691 --> 01:30:20.700
about abortion and better be great,
you know,

1565
01:30:20.701 --> 01:30:24.690
or you're a or you're in some real trouble where there are those people that

1566
01:30:24.691 --> 01:30:29.130
think that when you touch on controversial subjects that there's like a little,

1567
01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:30.990
there's weight to objects,
right?

1568
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:33.930
Like there's certain things that have more weight to them.

1569
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:37.890
Like if you can get through,
if you can actually get the bit to work,

1570
01:30:38.190 --> 01:30:39.570
it will have like a,

1571
01:30:39.670 --> 01:30:43.250
an artificial amount of momentum connected to it because of the fact that it was

1572
01:30:43.251 --> 01:30:47.610
all this weight.
It's more tension.
Yeah.
If you can cut that tension,

1573
01:30:47.611 --> 01:30:52.530
the laugh is bigger.
Yeah,
sure.
Yeah.
But if you can't,
oh no,
it's over.
Yeah.

1574
01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:55.740
They just like Maddie for even trying.
Yeah.
You know,

1575
01:30:55.890 --> 01:30:59.430
I don't think people get mad really,
that people make jokes about awful things.

1576
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:03.110
They get mad at the idea that people think it's funny.
Yeah.
You know,

1577
01:31:03.111 --> 01:31:05.610
it's not so much you've told a cancer joke.
It's like you think cancer is funny.

1578
01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:09.430
It's like,
no I don't.
That's why I'm making a joke about it.
You know?
That's like,

1579
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:12.120
that's,
that's the process.
But I really think it's like,

1580
01:31:12.121 --> 01:31:15.480
it's hearing an audience laugh at it more than hearing a comic.

1581
01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.060
Like if a comic tells it a cancer joke in a bombs,

1582
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:20.670
no one really gets mad at them.
If it's like killing,

1583
01:31:20.671 --> 01:31:25.290
that's when people get upset.
Well,
you act is so controversial.

1584
01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:30.180
You have so many subjects and it's so much tongue in cheek and there's so much

1585
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:34.650
where you're,
you know,
you,
you say mean shit on stage.

1586
01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:38.190
I would imagine that you get people upset at you quite a bit.

1587
01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:42.260
I used to and honestly now it's like I've been like grandfathered in and like,

1588
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:43.650
it's funny,
like I used to get people,

1589
01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:47.070
I would tweet a joke and some people would the comments and people were getting

1590
01:31:47.071 --> 01:31:51.720
mad at me and now what happens is that tweeted joke and then my fans start

1591
01:31:51.721 --> 01:31:55.680
tweeting their own jokes underneath it,
like tagging and people get mad at them.

1592
01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:59.680
It's like I'm just like the guy who is allowed to do it and people would stop

1593
01:31:59.681 --> 01:32:00.070
getting mad

1594
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.640
<v 0>at me.
All of a sudden you had a show called the Jessel neck offensive.</v>

1595
01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:07.000
I mean you've,
you do,
you are sort of grandfathered in,

1596
01:32:07.001 --> 01:32:09.290
but it's also like your style.
Yeah.
It's like,

1597
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:13.210
it's like being mad at slayer for being loud.

1598
01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:17.680
Like what do you,
that's what they do.
Exactly.
What are you talking about?
Yeah.

1599
01:32:17.681 --> 01:32:21.620
You're like,
but I like classical music.
It's like,
so what?
Go listen to that.
Yeah.

1600
01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:24.220
Yeah.
That is the weird thing about comedy too,
right?

1601
01:32:24.221 --> 01:32:28.510
It's like when you go to see comedy,
you could see all sorts of different styles.

1602
01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:32.290
Whereas when you go to see music,
if you go to a club,
it's like a blues club.

1603
01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:36.010
You expect to see blues.
Like you're going there on purpose.
You don't,

1604
01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:40.450
it's not like a blues band followed by a country band fall by a hardcore band

1605
01:32:40.530 --> 01:32:43.870
like it doesn't,
but that's what you get when you go to a comedy club.

1606
01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:47.020
You can get guns and roses followed by Barry Manilow and you're like,

1607
01:32:47.021 --> 01:32:51.640
what is this place?
Yeah.
You know,
like a,
a main room show on a Saturday night,

1608
01:32:51.850 --> 01:32:56.680
you're going to get virtually every genre of comedy there is.
I mean,

1609
01:32:56.681 --> 01:32:58.590
I liked that.
I'm glad it's like that because I hate,

1610
01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:02.460
like I when I used to tour and I couldn't bring my own opener,
you know,

1611
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:03.760
I would get to town,
they're like,
oh,

1612
01:33:03.761 --> 01:33:07.810
Jake has been begging us to open to open views so badly for months.

1613
01:33:08.130 --> 01:33:09.530
So we're letting him open a for you.

1614
01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:13.280
And he does my act for 15 minutes before he brings me onstage.
I was like,

1615
01:33:13.281 --> 01:33:17.020
I hate this and see if you haven't asked someone to actually do your actual

1616
01:33:17.021 --> 01:33:21.850
material.
Not my material,
but like they'll,
my mannerisms,
you know,
short,

1617
01:33:21.851 --> 01:33:24.940
dark jokes,
you know,
like that my attitude,

1618
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:28.420
they've just like taken it and they're like,
Oh,
if he,
Anthony sees me,

1619
01:33:28.421 --> 01:33:32.080
he'll be like,
oh,
you're like me,
come do that.
I'm like,
I don't want to see me.

1620
01:33:32.350 --> 01:33:35.680
You know,
I want to see anyone like me.
I don't ever,
I don't want us to like,

1621
01:33:35.770 --> 01:33:38.440
someone's like,
all this guy does really dark one liners.
You'd love it.
I'm like,

1622
01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:39.700
don't ever want to see it.

1623
01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:43.870
I don't ever want to look at it because that's what I do.
Right.
You know,
I like,

1624
01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:47.320
I want to see goofy,
silly,
just like the opposite of me.
Yeah.

1625
01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:49.720
Joey Diaz likes to bring girls on stage.

1626
01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:52.180
He brought it likes to bring girls on the road with them because he said he

1627
01:33:52.181 --> 01:33:54.460
wants the audience to see something totally different.

1628
01:33:54.461 --> 01:33:57.790
Anyone to give the women in the audience that are with their boyfriends that are

1629
01:33:57.791 --> 01:34:01.450
there to see him.
Like,
he's like,
this is good.
Like it'll balance it out.

1630
01:34:01.930 --> 01:34:06.160
I bring a lot of female openers,
uh,
mostly just completely different.

1631
01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:07.630
I don't want the same.
Even like,

1632
01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:11.030
I don't want them talking about the same subjects as me,
you know,

1633
01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:15.220
and then that's you that usually avoids it.
Uh,
completely.
I don't know.

1634
01:34:15.221 --> 01:34:16.570
I don't know how much I'm doing it for the,

1635
01:34:16.571 --> 01:34:20.770
the girlfriends of the guys who have come and certainly,
you know,

1636
01:34:20.771 --> 01:34:23.650
there are people come afterwards and then I liked you better than the headline

1637
01:34:23.651 --> 01:34:24.484
or it's like,

1638
01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:27.510
it is weird when you start taking someone on the road with you and then their

1639
01:34:27.511 --> 01:34:30.730
acts or it's morphing and becoming like yours,

1640
01:34:31.210 --> 01:34:35.500
like their style source because they see what,
what's working and so they start,

1641
01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:36.760
it's like a natural thing.
Like,

1642
01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:39.450
like you saying that you can't watch tell anymore,
you know,

1643
01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:40.870
especially with someone who's opening for you,

1644
01:34:40.871 --> 01:34:43.180
you got to think they're in the developmental period.
Oh yeah.

1645
01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:45.640
I've had MCS who by the end of the weekend or like,

1646
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:48.940
that's a great joke and I'm like,
Hey,
that's my line.
Like you can't,

1647
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.450
I know it's fun to do,
but like you can't do it when you're opening from me.

1648
01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:55.620
Like you've just been watching me all weekend and now you're copying my manner

1649
01:34:55.621 --> 01:34:58.130
with that.
That's knowing.
Yeah.
Cause then you have to think

1650
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:01.970
<v 2>about it.
[inaudible]
well,
you have to watch them.</v>

1651
01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.610
Is there any places where you just don't work anymore?
Like any cities?

1652
01:35:04.611 --> 01:35:09.470
We were like,
fuck this place.
Do you work in Miami and Miami?
I try not to.

1653
01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:12.470
I'll do it.
I'll do a feed or in Miami or like close by,

1654
01:35:12.471 --> 01:35:14.180
but I would never do a club down there.

1655
01:35:14.181 --> 01:35:16.940
Like Miami's like New Orleans and New Orleans is one of my favorite cities in

1656
01:35:16.941 --> 01:35:19.660
the world.
But like,
they have shit going on.
Yeah.

1657
01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:21.710
They don't care about your comedy.
Right.
You know,
Miami,

1658
01:35:21.711 --> 01:35:23.180
there's just too much else to do.

1659
01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:26.220
And New Orleans who've got like their music and their food and their alcohol,

1660
01:35:26.250 --> 01:35:31.130
they don't care about comedy.
Uh,
you can,
you can do a show there,
but it's not a,

1661
01:35:31.131 --> 01:35:34.760
it's not that fun.
It's not that fun.
Yeah.
Um,

1662
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:40.460
Miami might be the one,
but I'll do like Fort Lauderdale,
you know,

1663
01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:44.740
places around that.
A Florida can be tough.
Miami adjacent.
Yeah.
It's hard.

1664
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:47.540
It's tough.
Man.
Yeah,
it's tough.
That's it.

1665
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:51.020
That is the weirdest fucking state in the country for sure.

1666
01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.730
Yeah.
I'm trying to think of any other place that I was just like their clubs.

1667
01:35:55.731 --> 01:35:59.360
I would never go back to,
what about Connecticut?
Connecticut?

1668
01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.840
I think I just did somewhere in Connecticut and had a great,
I had a great time.

1669
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:04.970
I think they were just like,
they were like grateful that I was there.

1670
01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:08.120
I know some places you go and they're just like,
oh,
I can't believe he came here.

1671
01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:10.760
Yeah,
this is awesome.
Yeah.
But there was a,

1672
01:36:10.761 --> 01:36:15.761
I went to one club where just like the owner of the club made his,

1673
01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:18.350
made the green room.
His office.

1674
01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:19.970
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1675
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:23.310
<v 2>And we'd just sit in there and like be watching TV and talking to me the entire,</v>

1676
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.720
I'm like,

1677
01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:27.650
surely you're going to leave with 20 minutes before I go on stage and just what,

1678
01:36:27.651 --> 01:36:28.970
just in your face the whole time.

1679
01:36:28.971 --> 01:36:33.971
Like that was why he owned the club was to talk to comics and I just like lost

1680
01:36:34.011 --> 01:36:38.720
my mind.
Where was this?
Um,
uh,
I probably shouldn't say,
but I won't say,

1681
01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:43.370
uh,
what it sound like.
Um,
Columbus,

1682
01:36:43.371 --> 01:36:48.010
Ohio,
I think through issues.

1683
01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:53.520
Think what?
Hoosier's Hoosiers,
what are the Indiana yeah,
next door.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.

1684
01:36:53.690 --> 01:36:58.490
Okay.
Do you ever been there?
Um,
I think I did a show there once.
Yeah.

1685
01:36:58.670 --> 01:37:02.000
Yeah.
Coming up.
It was like a,
it was like a cool club to go do.

1686
01:37:02.001 --> 01:37:05.900
And I finally got there and like a year or so ago and I was like,

1687
01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:08.420
even on my friends,
I was like,
why did you,

1688
01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:10.130
why is everyone loved this club so much?
And they're like,

1689
01:37:10.131 --> 01:37:11.840
we couldn't wait to hear what you thought of him.

1690
01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:14.930
Wait to hear how mad you would get to this guy.

1691
01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:19.880
The weird thing is when a guy owns the club,

1692
01:37:19.881 --> 01:37:23.720
but then he's also the MC that happen.
Oh,
the worst.

1693
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:26.120
The absolute worst.

1694
01:37:28.650 --> 01:37:32.100
Can't stamp that.
Yeah.
That's not good.
No.
Yeah.

1695
01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:37.310
Is there any places in a overseas that you really enjoy working?
Yeah.

1696
01:37:37.311 --> 01:37:42.190
I went on a big European tour this summer and did,
uh,
did the,

1697
01:37:42.230 --> 01:37:44.390
did the standards,
you know,
did a couple of nights in London,

1698
01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:47.960
a couple of nights in Edinburgh during the festival.
Those were fun.
Um,

1699
01:37:47.961 --> 01:37:50.720
and then like places off the beaten path that I was like,

1700
01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:53.780
I want to do Berlin and I want to do Warsaw.
And they were like,

1701
01:37:53.781 --> 01:37:55.770
there's no market.
And I'm like,
I to do those,

1702
01:37:55.890 --> 01:37:58.310
those are the two most fun shows of the whole tour.

1703
01:37:58.311 --> 01:38:01.800
And it was like 300 people maybe.
But uh,

1704
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:04.470
but they were just so grateful you were there and they were,
they were awesome.

1705
01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:06.810
And they understand English like he would,
they,

1706
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:10.620
they understand it better than they can speak it.
So they laugh at every joke.

1707
01:38:10.621 --> 01:38:14.010
Nothing goes over their heads.
They don't have to change any references.

1708
01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:16.650
I've really loved,
uh,
the European tour.

1709
01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:19.800
It was cool because if you do an a place to like 300 seats,

1710
01:38:19.801 --> 01:38:24.150
even if it's a primarily a German or Polish speaking country,

1711
01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:28.230
there's going to be enough people that speak English.
They can come to your show.

1712
01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:31.920
Yeah.
A lot of ex pats,
you know,
and they're like,
and they,

1713
01:38:31.921 --> 01:38:36.120
they all say they got comedy 10 years ago.
Youtube is what did it for them.

1714
01:38:36.150 --> 01:38:40.770
So they all had these standup comedy scenes that are all 10 years old and

1715
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:44.790
they're all like dirt.
They're like bad for,
for people to do doing it.

1716
01:38:44.791 --> 01:38:48.210
10 years old,
there's still hacky,
you know,
they're like a generation away from,

1717
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:50.610
from getting good bye amber in Warsaw.
They were like,

1718
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:54.900
this is a historic day for Polish comedy.
Like you're the first American comic,

1719
01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:57.180
like big American comic to come here and do a show.

1720
01:38:57.330 --> 01:39:01.950
And now I think burrs go in there,
maybe just went there.
Uh,
but they're a,

1721
01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:06.960
they're getting more and more people wore saw what is Polen like honestly,

1722
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:11.700
we like got into the airport.
Asar luggage was,
wasn't there,

1723
01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:15.060
went straight to the GIG,
went on stage,
uh,

1724
01:39:15.061 --> 01:39:17.880
when to the hotel and the next morning flew to Budapest.

1725
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:20.790
Like we didn't get to see any of Warsaw or do anything there.

1726
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:23.340
I was one of the cities.
It was just,
there was just nothing to do.

1727
01:39:23.341 --> 01:39:26.940
But when I had my old comedy central show,
the Jessel nick offensive,

1728
01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:28.500
someone at comedy central says,
listen,

1729
01:39:28.501 --> 01:39:32.550
we can look at Google and tell you where your googled all around the world.

1730
01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:37.910
America by far the most.
Canada close second and then Wa and then uh,

1731
01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:40.770
Poland is number three and I'm like pulling why?
And they go,

1732
01:39:41.010 --> 01:39:45.300
they think you're Polish,
Polish,
they think they assume you're Polish.

1733
01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:48.210
So I'm like,
let's book a show there and have all these people come out.

1734
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:52.500
And whoever told me that fucking lied to me like they would,
they were like,
what?

1735
01:39:52.530 --> 01:39:55.290
We don't think your Polish?
Like why would you think your Polish?
Like,
no,

1736
01:39:55.291 --> 01:39:59.010
we don't give a shit.
I don't know who's told you that?
[inaudible] neck.

1737
01:39:59.370 --> 01:40:03.510
Slovenian.
Ah,
yeah.
Do you ever go there?
No.
Never been.

1738
01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:08.220
Never just do a show there.
It was,
it's kind of,
um,
I think I thought about it,

1739
01:40:08.221 --> 01:40:10.320
but it was just like routing,
you know what I mean?
It's like,

1740
01:40:10.321 --> 01:40:15.090
do I want to deal with what I have to deal with to get to Slovenia when I can

1741
01:40:15.091 --> 01:40:19.620
just go,
you know,
from to Australia at all.
Yeah.
I just did Australia.

1742
01:40:19.621 --> 01:40:24.030
I did like a,
I did a few weeks,
like a one week at the very end of the tour.

1743
01:40:24.270 --> 01:40:28.510
What'd you do?
I did a Brisbane,
Adelaide,
uh,

1744
01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:32.280
Melbourne and Sydney.
Melbourne and Sydney is the only places I've done,

1745
01:40:32.281 --> 01:40:34.880
but it's fucking a,
they're great.
I love those too.
Yeah.

1746
01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:38.040
If the world war three hits and that,
that place doesn't get nuked,

1747
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:39.900
that's the spot you think so.
Yeah.
It's an,

1748
01:40:39.901 --> 01:40:42.660
the other side of the planet wasn't their book though.
We're like,

1749
01:40:42.661 --> 01:40:44.710
that happens and everyone goes to Australia,

1750
01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:47.880
but there's like a cloud of radiation coming that's eventually going to get
them.

1751
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.190
Fuck.
Maybe we just get a big fan blow that shit to Russia.

1752
01:40:53.290 --> 01:40:54.123
I bet that would work.

1753
01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:55.700
<v 0>But it's just the Chinese exam.</v>

1754
01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:00.990
Look if they can figure out how to nuke an entire country with a few bombs that

1755
01:41:00.991 --> 01:41:03.810
drop out of airplanes or shoot out a rockets,

1756
01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:07.090
we should be able to build a giant fan.
Build a big fan.
Yeah.
Why is it so hard?

1757
01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:09.160
Like I was reading the shit about space junk.

1758
01:41:09.250 --> 01:41:10.600
Do you know how much space chunk there is?

1759
01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:13.690
Like this style's a lot floating around in space,

1760
01:41:13.691 --> 01:41:18.280
like thousands of pieces of shit just flying around broken satellites parts.

1761
01:41:18.281 --> 01:41:21.820
Is it all just broken satellites?
All kinds of shit.
All kinds of stuff.

1762
01:41:21.821 --> 01:41:25.900
Stuff from,
you know like when rockets take off and then they eject.

1763
01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:29.180
They leave little pieces of stuff up in there and it.

1764
01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:32.920
And is it like in a ring like let me take a Saturn type or ring or is it just

1765
01:41:32.921 --> 01:41:35.710
everywhere?
It's everywhere.
It's all over the planet.

1766
01:41:36.370 --> 01:41:39.700
It's like it's in the sky.
Like it's in the ocean.

1767
01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:44.590
It's like there's pieces of shit just flying around above our head and like they

1768
01:41:44.591 --> 01:41:47.820
have to be cognizant about it if they're going to launch a rocket.
Yeah,

1769
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:51.870
like you could run into it.
Space,
debris and human spacecraft.

1770
01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:57.280
The all travel at speeds up to 17,500 miles an hour,

1771
01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:03.060
more than 500,000 pieces of debris or space junk are tracked as the orbit earth.

1772
01:42:03.850 --> 01:42:04.361
Think of that.

1773
01:42:04.361 --> 01:42:09.361
They travel at speeds up to 17,500 miles and hour small enough for a relatively

1774
01:42:10.961 --> 01:42:15.010
small piece of orbital debris to damage a satellite or a spacecraft.

1775
01:42:17.230 --> 01:42:22.120
That's,
how was that movie with Sandra Bullock?
Gravity.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1776
01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:24.370
Cause it doesn't.
Nice chunk comes down on us.
Yeah.

1777
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:27.460
They're like fixing a satellite and someone comes by and hits them,

1778
01:42:27.461 --> 01:42:28.510
mix it and the next thing you know,

1779
01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:32.140
fuck that shit can happen and they don't know what to do either.

1780
01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:34.090
Like the throw a net up there.
What are you going to do?

1781
01:42:34.150 --> 01:42:37.450
I would think of like some kind of magnet satellite that would just attract

1782
01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:41.290
everything.
Right.
But then it would probably get too heavy.

1783
01:42:41.890 --> 01:42:45.010
I think we'll probably take out things that you need.
Yeah.

1784
01:42:45.011 --> 01:42:47.260
Is this the junk that we can track over time?

1785
01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:52.261
It starts at 57 there's only two things out there and that God word gross were

1786
01:42:53.050 --> 01:42:57.010
so gross.
I bet the ocean's a similar similar story.
Wow.

1787
01:42:57.011 --> 01:43:01.240
Look at all the shit around is even worse.
Oh my God.
That's incredible.

1788
01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:03.360
That's all real.
I don't know,

1789
01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:09.120
2015 the entire low enter like near Earth orbit is covered with shit,

1790
01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:15.490
space,
debris,
satellites and nonsense.

1791
01:43:15.730 --> 01:43:16.690
I mean at what point in time,

1792
01:43:16.691 --> 01:43:20.110
I mean we've only been traveling in the space since the 1960s right,
so what?

1793
01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.990
When is this going to end like that?
That's not that long ago.

1794
01:43:22.991 --> 01:43:24.190
That's 50 plus years ago.

1795
01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:27.220
What are we going to do when it's a hundred years from now?
500 Years from now?

1796
01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:29.170
I mean are we going to be able to see the sun?

1797
01:43:29.410 --> 01:43:33.150
Let me just look up and just see space shit floating overhead instead.

1798
01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:36.550
It's only 500,000 pieces of the earth is pretty fucking big still.

1799
01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:38.110
We'd have to get,
yeah,

1800
01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:42.220
I guess like I just snapped the fact that it said if you dug a hole through the

1801
01:43:42.221 --> 01:43:44.560
earth,
it would take you 42 minutes to fall through it.

1802
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.610
It's like how fucking big as that.
So it's a long,
long drawl.
Yeah,
it's a long,

1803
01:43:48.611 --> 01:43:51.850
far Austin.
I was thinking would you stop in the middle?
It

1804
01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:54.830
<v 1>dies.
It cooked.
I know,
but in theory if you didn't yet.
Yeah.</v>

1805
01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:55.970
If it was just a tube,

1806
01:43:56.220 --> 01:44:00.260
an n zero temperature or neutral temperature tube.

1807
01:44:00.630 --> 01:44:05.060
I wonder how like how accurate Snapple facts really have to be like bull shit on

1808
01:44:05.061 --> 01:44:09.350
a Snapple fact,
like don't drink that shit.
So I don't read those things.

1809
01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:13.250
I didn't even know they had Snapple facts until you just said that.
I didn't.

1810
01:44:14.090 --> 01:44:17.060
They used to have like little things on the caps.
Like you say,

1811
01:44:17.061 --> 01:44:19.850
it makes sense to me,
but I don't think I've ever read one of them.

1812
01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:24.720
<v 2>I used to always read them.
No.
Yeah,
I can't remember any of them ever get angry.</v>

1813
01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:30.120
How does snap effect?
No,
I have gotten mad at like a Bazooka Joe Comic.

1814
01:44:30.730 --> 01:44:32.700
Just be like this fucking you kidding me?

1815
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:37.670
<v 1>Yeah,
this is bullshit.
They phone it in sometimes big time.
Well,</v>

1816
01:44:37.671 --> 01:44:41.720
comics in general I think is some,
like,
there's great comics,

1817
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:43.040
there's really funny comics,

1818
01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:46.550
but then there's comic strips that have existed forever and they're fucking

1819
01:44:46.551 --> 01:44:51.170
terrible.
And for some reason or another they just still exist.
Oh yeah.

1820
01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:55.040
Do they any more though?
Like is there still a sec?
I haven't read a newspaper.

1821
01:44:55.041 --> 01:44:56.000
Like a physical print?

1822
01:44:56.050 --> 01:45:00.700
<v 2>No,
I think it's smaller and smaller.
Uh,
the than it ever has been before.</v>

1823
01:45:00.701 --> 01:45:04.090
But like,
they're still cranking out Garfield,
you know?
Garfield's still a thing.

1824
01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:08.200
Yeah.
And the guy,
Jim Davis,
critic Garfield has nothing to do with it.

1825
01:45:08.230 --> 01:45:11.980
He's like golfing and like collecting money and he's got ghost writers.

1826
01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:14.620
So it was just like the worst shit ever.
Oh Wow.

1827
01:45:14.650 --> 01:45:17.380
So he hires people to do it and he makes all the money.

1828
01:45:18.130 --> 01:45:22.720
He's probably worth $1 billion.
I guarantee the merchandise,
this fucking things.

1829
01:45:22.721 --> 01:45:27.040
You stick on your car alone.
My bad.
Those were everywhere that like the,
yeah,

1830
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:32.430
it's all so I think the Calvin and Hobbes guy would never let them make toys of

1831
01:45:32.921 --> 01:45:36.730
Calvin and Hobbes and the books.
Yeah.
He didn't want that money.

1832
01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:40.810
A Calvin and Hobbes plug money once.
He didn't want his creation being like,

1833
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:45.430
he didn't want to be like Jim Davis.
Um,
that's why I think the best,

1834
01:45:45.970 --> 01:45:48.700
like the best comic ever.
Uh,

1835
01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:52.600
gotta be Gary Larson's the Pharcyde those things fucking hold up.

1836
01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:55.720
Is your read those back in the day?
He retired a long time ago,

1837
01:45:55.800 --> 01:46:00.250
but there's still stuff rate.
Right.
And then who did Doonesbury

1838
01:46:02.230 --> 01:46:06.310
that's like the political one,
right?
That's still,
is that his name?
Maybe?
Yeah.

1839
01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:12.190
<v 1>What the fuck?
Who the fuck was,
is it Trudeau?
What's his first name?
Gary Trudeau.</v>

1840
01:46:12.610 --> 01:46:17.050
Isn't that,
what's the name?
The Guy who runs Canada.
Justin.

1841
01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:18.033
Justin.

1842
01:46:18.510 --> 01:46:22.440
<v 2>That guy?
Yeah.
I never got Doonesbury.
I never like,
it was like too clever.</v>

1843
01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:25.620
I was like,
okay.
Like I guess they're taken down Ronald Reagan or something,

1844
01:46:25.621 --> 01:46:28.680
but I don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
Doonesbury's weird too,

1845
01:46:28.681 --> 01:46:31.300
because they basically,
they

1846
01:46:31.670 --> 01:46:35.190
<v 1>can hold hunter s Thompson and turned him into this.</v>

1847
01:46:35.191 --> 01:46:39.870
They had a character that they were doing.
I think he wound up suing them.
Yeah.

1848
01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:44.880
There's his character is basically the exact same guy,
just slightly different.

1849
01:46:45.150 --> 01:46:48.390
And he was always like shooting off guns and doing a bunch of crazy shit.

1850
01:46:49.890 --> 01:46:54.720
I forget his name.
I forget the name of the guy.
They gave him a different name,

1851
01:46:54.721 --> 01:46:58.650
like uncle something or another.
Yeah,
but that was there.

1852
01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:02.640
I mean that was Garry Trudeau's take on hunter s Thompson and it wound up

1853
01:47:02.641 --> 01:47:05.940
driving hunters Thompson nuts.
Is this still real?

1854
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:10.680
These still doing like he's doing Trump this.

1855
01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:15.720
That's 2017.
Wow.
Wow.

1856
01:47:16.650 --> 01:47:17.670
Yeah.
But he,
um,

1857
01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:23.490
so he created this character that was basically the most exaggerated versions of

1858
01:47:23.491 --> 01:47:27.360
hunter s Thompson one hunters Thompson was fucking around and it sort of defined

1859
01:47:27.361 --> 01:47:28.710
who hunter s Thompson was too.

1860
01:47:28.711 --> 01:47:32.800
A lot of people because instead of being this brilliant journalist who you know

1861
01:47:32.830 --> 01:47:33.930
is great writer,

1862
01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:38.030
he also became this kind of like guide,

1863
01:47:38.031 --> 01:47:42.600
just shoots guns and was always drunk and then you fall into that trap.

1864
01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:48.030
I think comedians that have a persona like oftentimes fall,

1865
01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:52.320
like you know dice that's not,
his real name is Andrew Silverstein.

1866
01:47:52.321 --> 01:47:56.220
And the dice character was a part of his act.

1867
01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:58.700
He had a bunch of different things you can do.
Impressions,

1868
01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:02.970
we do Travolta impression.
Yeah,
phenomenal,
phenomenal Travolta impression.

1869
01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:08.210
And then the dice man became like a part of his act and then he just decided

1870
01:48:08.701 --> 01:48:11.400
that's the best part,
so I'm just going to do dice all the time.

1871
01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:14.040
And then he decided,
you know what?
Fuck live in like a regular person.

1872
01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:15.930
It was going to be dice all the time.

1873
01:48:16.050 --> 01:48:19.440
So he became the guy in his act.
I mean,

1874
01:48:19.441 --> 01:48:22.770
that's who he is like most of the time.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1875
01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:25.650
Kinison Kennison under similar,
similar situation.

1876
01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:29.230
<v 2>Never met Kennison Kinnison I mean he died well before I got into stand up,</v>

1877
01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:32.410
but I'd never met dice and I've always like sang his praises.

1878
01:48:32.411 --> 01:48:35.440
Like I think the day the laughter died is one of the greatest comedy albums of

1879
01:48:35.441 --> 01:48:40.300
all time.
Uh,
and uh,
and I've just never met him.
He's great.
Yeah.

1880
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:43.120
I'll let you do,
see you next time.
I see him at the store if you're there.

1881
01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:47.890
I've heard great stories.
He must like,
he must know who I am.
Oh yeah.

1882
01:48:48.210 --> 01:48:52.080
Yeah.
I once did.
Governor,
if he wasn't,
we'd be mad.
I wouldn't be mad.

1883
01:48:52.081 --> 01:48:54.670
I would be surprised just because I've spoken about him publicly,

1884
01:48:54.671 --> 01:48:56.140
that like if he was,

1885
01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:58.930
if he was wondering why he sold like a thousand copies of the day,

1886
01:48:58.931 --> 01:49:01.480
the laughter died after I like talked about it on a podcast.

1887
01:49:01.481 --> 01:49:04.210
Like he would hear that,
you know,
someone says something nice about you,

1888
01:49:04.211 --> 01:49:07.670
you find out.
Um,
but,
uh,
uh,

1889
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:09.910
I was at governor's once and they were like all proud.
They were like,

1890
01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:13.770
dice was here last weekend and he left one of his gloves,
you know,

1891
01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:16.960
the fingerless gloves.
And I was just like,
give it to me.

1892
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:20.430
What do I have to do to take this glove home?
But I'd still have it.

1893
01:49:20.431 --> 01:49:22.660
I like where it or I'm aware it around.
Sometimes it's fun.

1894
01:49:22.690 --> 01:49:25.630
Do you read and write jokes with it?
Oh,
well I'll,
I'll,

1895
01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:28.770
I'll walk around like just doing the,
doing a little bit.
Just one little o's.

1896
01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:30.750
But it's funny.
Cigarettes like loose.
Yeah.

1897
01:49:32.530 --> 01:49:35.380
<v 1>But uh,
but yeah,
love,
love dogs.
But those characters,</v>

1898
01:49:35.381 --> 01:49:39.250
when guys get lumped into a character,
when you get locked into that,

1899
01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:41.760
it can be very self-defining,
you know?

1900
01:49:41.770 --> 01:49:44.620
Of course Rick Kennison I think it was very self-define oh,
big time.

1901
01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:48.100
<v 2>I the,
I thought about that when I was creating my persona.
It was like,</v>

1902
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:50.830
what's going to age?
Well?
Hmm.
You know,
like,

1903
01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:53.880
not like I think of a guy like Nick Swardson,
you know,

1904
01:49:53.890 --> 01:49:57.770
who's just like party all the time.
Like he's a college kid forever,
right?

1905
01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:01.210
It's like,
how long can you do that for?
You know what I mean?

1906
01:50:01.211 --> 01:50:04.300
It's like still kind of asked to do it and it's still great,
but I'm like,

1907
01:50:04.301 --> 01:50:06.280
are you enjoying this?
You know,

1908
01:50:06.281 --> 01:50:11.110
like I want to be able to like kind of hold onto my dignity,
you know,

1909
01:50:11.150 --> 01:50:14.350
does the best version of it.
Emo Phillips.
Yes.

1910
01:50:14.530 --> 01:50:17.410
That's the best example because it's like wow.
Like,

1911
01:50:17.411 --> 01:50:20.440
cause when he was a young sort of cute guy,

1912
01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:24.390
it was kind of strange to watch him go call medical.

1913
01:50:24.391 --> 01:50:28.900
I bliss when you're 60 though and you're doing that,
people are like,
hey man,

1914
01:50:29.170 --> 01:50:30.430
this is just weird.

1915
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:36.030
Like bobcat talked about that like that bobcat had this moment where he stopped

1916
01:50:36.251 --> 01:50:40.270
being bobcat and people like,
hey man,
how can we not do it?
The scream.
He's like,

1917
01:50:40.271 --> 01:50:44.770
fuck you,
I'm not doing it.
I hate told me the best story ever.
He said,
he's in a,

1918
01:50:44.830 --> 01:50:45.760
he's at a comedy,

1919
01:50:45.761 --> 01:50:50.200
works in Denver doing a weekend and he's eaten shit every show and every show,

1920
01:50:50.201 --> 01:50:53.350
he's just bombing and everyone's going to do the voice,
do the voice.

1921
01:50:53.351 --> 01:50:55.150
And he's like,
no,
I'm not.
I don't do the voice anymore.

1922
01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:58.810
I'm not doing the voice late show Saturday.
Uh,

1923
01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:03.310
someone in the backyards were from Aurora,
do the voice for us.
And he goes,
Oh,

1924
01:51:03.311 --> 01:51:06.910
you're from Aurora.
At least you learn to sit in the back.

1925
01:51:07.810 --> 01:51:12.770
And he said,
and this is like a year after the shooting,
the movie theater.

1926
01:51:12.771 --> 01:51:16.720
Yes.
A year after that.
And he said the entire audience,

1927
01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:21.130
the entire audience just pretended he didn't say it,

1928
01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:26.470
they didn't boo,
they didn't laugh,
they just acted like nothing had happened.

1929
01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:29.440
And he did the rest of the show and he said him and made the whole weekend worth

1930
01:51:29.441 --> 01:51:33.460
it for him.
Just to say that.
Yeah,

1931
01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:36.910
<v 1>dude,
I was speaking of which I was watching a video today,</v>

1932
01:51:36.911 --> 01:51:38.470
you know how Youtube for whatever reason,

1933
01:51:38.471 --> 01:51:43.210
just starts recommending things and you'd click on it watching a video today on,

1934
01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:44.590
oh,
this is what it was.

1935
01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:49.390
I was looking at bulletproof clothing for whatever reason,
because I was like,

1936
01:51:49.590 --> 01:51:53.680
well,
I saw an ad on Instagram where this guy had a bulletproof hoodie on and it

1937
01:51:53.681 --> 01:51:55.510
looked like a regular hoodie and he shot himself.

1938
01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:59.340
<v 2>Is that like a John Wick situation where it's like,
yes,
it's like,
it's like</v>

1939
01:51:59.690 --> 01:52:01.860
<v 1>Sonin in in the fabric.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1940
01:52:02.010 --> 01:52:06.690
So this guy had a regular hoodie and he shot himself in the gut with a a nine

1941
01:52:06.691 --> 01:52:08.430
millimeter,
just bang.
Wow.

1942
01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:13.170
Why was playing this video with like a regular Hoodie?
I was like,
this is crazy.

1943
01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.690
And this Hoodie,
it looked like a regular hoodie was,

1944
01:52:15.691 --> 01:52:17.790
but it's some sort of Kevlar or something.

1945
01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:23.480
So then it recommends this next thing and this next video that I watch is on

1946
01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:29.280
whether or not you should carry with a bullet in the chamber.

1947
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:34.320
So it's this guy who's just speculating.
I liked it.

1948
01:52:34.321 --> 01:52:35.640
There's two kinds of people.

1949
01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:39.360
There's kind of people that thinks they're going to have enough time to rack a

1950
01:52:39.361 --> 01:52:44.190
bullet.
And there's a bunch of people that realize that when something happens,

1951
01:52:44.191 --> 01:52:47.630
it's like being in a accident happens quickly and you gotta be prepared.

1952
01:52:47.631 --> 01:52:49.250
You're not going to have enough time to rack a bullet.

1953
01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:55.120
And so there was this long discussion as to whether or not you should have a

1954
01:52:55.341 --> 01:52:59.000
bullet in the chamber or not when you conceal carry.

1955
01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:01.700
And he was talking about how this guy was open carrying,

1956
01:53:01.701 --> 01:53:05.510
but he could see that the guys,
the hammer was shut down on the pistol,

1957
01:53:05.511 --> 01:53:09.770
which means he's going to have to cock it cause it was a,
not a revolver but uh,

1958
01:53:09.771 --> 01:53:14.210
you know,
whatever.
And Autumn Semite what did,
what is it,
what is it,

1959
01:53:14.211 --> 01:53:17.480
when you call,
what do you call one of those when you have to load it like that,

1960
01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:22.490
like a nine millimeter glock.
What is the difference?
Well,
one's a revolver.

1961
01:53:22.491 --> 01:53:26.060
Revolver revolves,
so it's on a revolver.
It's just a pistol.
Anyway,

1962
01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:30.320
he was saying because the way the hammer was,
he could tell that this guy,
uh,

1963
01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:30.711
you know,

1964
01:53:30.711 --> 01:53:33.290
he was going to have to pull that hammer back and was going to use that gun.

1965
01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:39.360
And I was like,
this is,
this is like next level thinking like these people,

1966
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:42.560
everywhere you go,
someone's worrying about shooting you.

1967
01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:47.480
And then I go onto Twitter almost like this is synchronicity.

1968
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:51.410
And Eric Weinstein is a friend of mine says,

1969
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:56.830
is this the year where the debate is something,
something in terms of a,

1970
01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:02.200
is it appropriate to bring a loaded gun into a place where you worship now to

1971
01:54:04.221 --> 01:54:05.054
protect yourself?

1972
01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:09.440
Because there've been so many attacks on people and synagogues and churches and

1973
01:54:09.441 --> 01:54:12.500
mosques and I'm like,
fuck man,

1974
01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:17.660
what probably what?
What is happening here?
It's,

1975
01:54:17.661 --> 01:54:22.160
I mean it's bad.
I don't,
I'm not,
I'm not like a,
there's two more today.

1976
01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:26.620
What do you mean there's two more attacks today at synagogues.
It was,

1977
01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:30.260
one was in a church.
What were the ones that had,
that happened today?

1978
01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:32.760
There was two smaller ones.
There was no as the,

1979
01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:36.620
there was the church that was in San Diego this weekend.
No,
the,
the,
uh,

1980
01:54:36.621 --> 01:54:39.830
the synagogue in San Diego this weekend.
But there was another one,

1981
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:42.320
like this morning when I was reading the news,

1982
01:54:43.190 --> 01:54:44.670
<v 2>Los Angeles.
Yes.</v>

1983
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:48.280
What was it for my 26 year old US army soldiers servers,

1984
01:54:48.281 --> 01:54:51.530
Afghanistan has been charged with plotting terror attacks in Los Angeles area,

1985
01:54:52.010 --> 01:54:56.900
a rally in Long Beach.
So it's on,

1986
01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:58.640
it's on the front page.
Is he had already got something like,

1987
01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:00.890
it's dumb sounds leaking through the video.

1988
01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:03.260
Did he do something or did he just got caught plot?

1989
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:06.290
It says he was accused of targeting juices.
They walked to the synagogue,

1990
01:55:06.291 --> 01:55:09.980
police officer's a military facility and crowds at the Santa Monica pier.

1991
01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:11.470
<v 1>I think there was another one too.</v>

1992
01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:16.270
There was another one somewhere else might've been outside the country today.

1993
01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:20.650
It's like fuck,
like this shit is ramping up.
Yeah,

1994
01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:25.270
it's getting worse and worse.
Are you a gun guy?
I have guns.

1995
01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:27.400
I wouldn't say I'm a gun guy,

1996
01:55:27.790 --> 01:55:30.850
but I have them the hunting or like just don't really,

1997
01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:34.150
I have hunting guns and I have safety guns.

1998
01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:38.270
Like security guns are private,
you know,
personal protection guns.
But,

1999
01:55:38.890 --> 01:55:42.430
um,
I hunt with a bow and arrow mostly,

2000
01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:43.980
but of

2001
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:47.400
<v 0>course I'm not opposed to,
when you say,
of course being sarcastic,</v>

2002
01:55:49.370 --> 01:55:53.390
<v 1>I'm,
I'm not opposed to it.
What does this California synagogue attack latest?
Oh,</v>

2003
01:55:53.391 --> 01:55:56.850
this is the,
they found a social media message,
I guess,
right

2004
01:55:57.010 --> 01:56:01.330
<v 0>before it happened.
Of course.
Jesus Christ.</v>

2005
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:04.690
No,
I dunno.
I think there was one other one that I saw.

2006
01:56:04.691 --> 01:56:09.040
I believe it was in another country.
That's all right.
It's enough.

2007
01:56:09.370 --> 01:56:12.430
There's so many.
I know,
I know.
He just numb to it.

2008
01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:16.630
Well also that their chart targeting places of worship now,

2009
01:56:16.631 --> 01:56:18.130
like what the fuck man?

2010
01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:25.360
Do you have guns?
No.
Would you ever own one?
They make me uncomfortable.

2011
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:28.990
Like I'm not like against it.
People want to have guns.
Okay.
I'm not done.

2012
01:56:28.991 --> 01:56:31.090
That's not a hill I'm going to die on.
But,
uh,

2013
01:56:31.570 --> 01:56:35.280
I think what's happening with the schools and churches is a,

2014
01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:39.250
is reprehensible and it's,
we are the only country where this really happens.

2015
01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:43.840
You know,
it was me.
Not Anymore.
It's happening,
you know,
uh,
around the world.

2016
01:56:43.841 --> 01:56:48.280
But it's,
it's much more often here.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2017
01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:50.740
Now there's,
there's certainly an argument for that.

2018
01:56:50.830 --> 01:56:54.730
The real problem is the guns are already there.
It's like,
how do you,

2019
01:56:54.731 --> 01:56:58.750
what do you do when you live in a country of 300 plus million people with 300

2020
01:56:58.751 --> 01:57:02.650
plus million guns?
Like how do you ever eradicate that?
How do you ever,

2021
01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:07.860
how do you shift the path that we seem to be on what you do?

2022
01:57:08.410 --> 01:57:11.590
I mean everything is like,
you know,
people talk about this and then like,

2023
01:57:11.591 --> 01:57:14.230
you know how,
how do we do what,
what is it,
the culture is,

2024
01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:18.460
is it the this and he turned on the TV and it's like a video game commercial or

2025
01:57:18.461 --> 01:57:22.480
a commercial for a movie and it's just a supermodel spinning around in circles

2026
01:57:22.510 --> 01:57:24.250
shooting everything she sees you.
You're like,

2027
01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:26.260
you don't think this is happened in the fact?

2028
01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:29.980
Like they just make it look so cool that if you want to be the hero,

2029
01:57:29.981 --> 01:57:32.320
you got to have a gun.
You know.
How about John Wick,

2030
01:57:32.380 --> 01:57:35.530
John Wick three coming out to my fucking favorite thing and I'm like,

2031
01:57:35.531 --> 01:57:40.180
this is the most,
the most glorifying gun shit ever.
But I love it.
I love it.

2032
01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:44.170
It is a problem.
I mean it has,
it hasn't made me turn to guns,
you know,

2033
01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:46.180
mean I wouldn't say that like video games,
you know,

2034
01:57:46.181 --> 01:57:49.210
make this video games or making people more violent.
I don't,

2035
01:57:49.211 --> 01:57:52.570
I don't believe that.
I don't know if there,
there's evidence to back that,

2036
01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:57.280
but I mean I've always loved,
you know,
James Bond movies,
you know,

2037
01:57:57.281 --> 01:57:59.800
things like where guns are are a,

2038
01:57:59.801 --> 01:58:03.250
are a big part of it and it's never made me want to pick one up.
Well,
there's

2039
01:58:03.770 --> 01:58:08.770
<v 1>argument that that alleviates some of the need for violence that people like</v>

2040
01:58:08.901 --> 01:58:11.960
seeing it and in seeing it and something like John Wick,

2041
01:58:11.961 --> 01:58:13.370
it actually relaxes people.

2042
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:16.190
There's a real argument for that and there's a real argument that you could make

2043
01:58:16.191 --> 01:58:18.800
with that,
with video games too.
But that is not with everybody.

2044
01:58:18.801 --> 01:58:22.550
The problem is certain people are very susceptible to influence.

2045
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:23.750
They're susceptible,

2046
01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:28.430
they're vulnerable to being influenced or excited in one particular direction,

2047
01:58:28.850 --> 01:58:29.810
whether it's,
uh,

2048
01:58:30.050 --> 01:58:34.730
excited to become radicalized and become a white nationalist and want to shoot

2049
01:58:34.731 --> 01:58:37.070
up,
you know,
uh,
whatever.

2050
01:58:37.071 --> 01:58:40.910
Figure out that whatever the group is or whether it's,
you know,

2051
01:58:40.930 --> 01:58:41.980
there's certain people that,

2052
01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:46.420
<v 0>you know,
they'll see something in a movie or a video game.</v>

2053
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:49.590
It will make them want to act that out.
But they usually mentally ill.
I mean,

2054
01:58:49.591 --> 01:58:50.830
that's,
that's a real problem.

2055
01:58:50.860 --> 01:58:54.340
The real problem is mental illness at the type of person that could go into a

2056
01:58:54.341 --> 01:58:57.760
synagogue and just start shooting people.
That's a mentally ill person.

2057
01:58:57.790 --> 01:59:02.140
That's regardless of whether or not they have a gun or not.
That's a sick person.

2058
01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:07.380
So we have to figure out like what's causing this massive amount of mental

2059
01:59:08.921 --> 01:59:10.840
illness in this country.
Cause that's a big,

2060
01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:15.100
that's the guy in Aurora is a perfect example.
Like I was,

2061
01:59:15.490 --> 01:59:18.040
they knew he was sick.
They knew there was something really,

2062
01:59:18.041 --> 01:59:20.560
I mean if you see a photos of that fucking guy,
you look at his eyes,

2063
01:59:20.770 --> 01:59:24.550
he was completely batshit crazy.
I think it's something to,
to like when they,

2064
01:59:24.551 --> 01:59:27.970
when they,
now they've started to refuse to show the guy's face,
you know,
I mean,

2065
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.080
they won't show it because they're like,

2066
01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:32.830
this guy's getting glory now and the next shooter wants to top that.

2067
01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:35.230
But I think they're getting a little bit smarter about it.
But what's the,

2068
01:59:35.231 --> 01:59:38.410
what's the quote?
No Man chooses evil because it's evil.

2069
01:59:38.710 --> 01:59:40.150
They only mistake it for happiness.

2070
01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:41.713
<v 5>Mm.</v>

2071
01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:47.010
<v 0>Like I believe that.
Yeah.
That's a good quote.
Yeah.</v>

2072
01:59:47.250 --> 01:59:50.760
They mistake it for happiness or they want other people to feel what they feel.

2073
01:59:51.210 --> 01:59:56.100
They want other people to suffer the way they're suffering.
Now with,

2074
01:59:56.820 --> 02:00:00.330
I mean,
when you ever have a giant country filled with people,

2075
02:00:00.331 --> 02:00:04.560
you're going to have a broad spectrum of people's experiences and so you're

2076
02:00:04.561 --> 02:00:08.280
going to have a certain number of people that are on the low end of experiences,

2077
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:12.720
the worst experiences all the time,
sexual abuse,
physical abuse,
violence,

2078
02:00:12.990 --> 02:00:17.550
mental illness,
pills,
drugs,
this,
that boom.

2079
02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:20.940
But like Japan is one of the most unhappy countries in the world.

2080
02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:25.430
People at the suicide rate is off the charts,
but they take themselves out.
Yeah.

2081
02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:29.730
Know in America it's like,
let me,
who can I take with me?
I don't know what that,

2082
02:00:29.850 --> 02:00:31.170
what that is.
Well,

2083
02:00:31.230 --> 02:00:36.120
Japan emphasizes humility and uh,
they reward it.

2084
02:00:36.270 --> 02:00:40.200
Like if they emphasize being polite and orderly.

2085
02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:42.610
It's really interesting.
Um,

2086
02:00:42.690 --> 02:00:47.690
there was a dis piece I was watching on Youtube of these people that live in

2087
02:00:48.361 --> 02:00:49.680
cyber cafes,

2088
02:00:50.070 --> 02:00:54.270
that they have cyber cafes that are open 24 hours a day in Japan and they have

2089
02:00:54.271 --> 02:00:58.560
like this little cubicles that you taken there and they're just online on their

2090
02:00:58.561 --> 02:01:01.560
computer and they have all their things there and that's where they live and

2091
02:01:01.561 --> 02:01:03.870
they shower and they go back to their little cubicle.

2092
02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:08.010
But this woman was saying that it made her feel like she wasn't alone,

2093
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:10.740
but she wasn't with people either.
Like she likes that,

2094
02:01:10.980 --> 02:01:15.210
that like she wants to know that there's people around her but she doesn't want

2095
02:01:15.211 --> 02:01:19.230
anybody in her life.
And I was like,
Ooh,
it was dark.
Yeah.

2096
02:01:19.950 --> 02:01:22.230
Yeah.
That's super fucking dark.
Sad.

2097
02:01:22.770 --> 02:01:25.170
Just the loneliness like that.

2098
02:01:25.171 --> 02:01:28.770
That's a giant issue apparently in Japan is how lonely people are,

2099
02:01:28.771 --> 02:01:31.200
which is incredibly ironic when you consider that it's probably one of the most

2100
02:01:31.201 --> 02:01:34.500
population dense places on earth and Tokyo at least.
Oh yeah.

2101
02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:36.270
I think they're just working their asses off.

2102
02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:40.730
I mean they fucking loved jumped in of trans,
they live for it.

2103
02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:45.470
Like it really is like the of countries that it's the least happy country and

2104
02:01:45.471 --> 02:01:46.880
the world.
Wow.

2105
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:51.410
I think number like the happiest is like someone's Scandinavia,

2106
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:56.660
Sweden or some shit.
Yeah.
Finland.
I think Finland like ranks very highly on that.

2107
02:01:56.710 --> 02:01:57.543
Yeah.

2108
02:01:58.060 --> 02:02:02.240
Why is it the thing I was watching said it was like a sense of community.

2109
02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:05.720
I think that them live together and like they eat their meals together as like a

2110
02:02:05.721 --> 02:02:09.500
neighborhood almost and they just like everyone contributes and they're just

2111
02:02:09.710 --> 02:02:13.010
happy and content.
That makes sense.
The numbers are smaller too.

2112
02:02:13.710 --> 02:02:17.780
I think that that helps also.
It's gorgeous up there.
That helps too.

2113
02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:23.000
A lot of factors there,
right?
Yeah.
Like what's a big city and Finland?
Helsinki.

2114
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:26.270
How many people is at 50 how many people live in Helsinki?

2115
02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:32.060
50 50 50 I bet.
50 yeah,
I bet you're right.
I would.

2116
02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:36.770
I Bet Helsinki has 1.2 million people.
How many people think you have?

2117
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:40.970
That's a wild guess.
I don't know why I had to put the 0.2 in there.

2118
02:02:40.971 --> 02:02:44.810
I'm hedging my bet if I was on the price is right.
It's the biggest,

2119
02:02:44.811 --> 02:02:49.220
but the thing I pull up doesn't say the second largest says 279,000 say he'll

2120
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:51.650
think he does.
Well,
it doesn't.
You can't.
Doesn't.

2121
02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:54.380
If you Google population at the Helsinki,
it's the very first thing I had,

2122
02:02:54.381 --> 02:02:56.450
which was the biggest cities in Finland.
I figured it would.
It had it.

2123
02:02:56.530 --> 02:03:00.920
Oh five 58 558,000 yeah,
that ain't shit.

2124
02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:05.480
Wow.
That's it.
That's what they're happy.
It's basically like four boulders.
Yeah.

2125
02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:08.600
For Boulder.
Colorado's and it's a whole country.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2126
02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:12.290
You go to boulder then some of the nicest people ever.
Why 100,000 of them?

2127
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:17.230
Is it hard to build their beautiful bolt?
Beautiful,

2128
02:03:17.290 --> 02:03:20.450
beautiful,
gorgeous,
great people.
Little on the social side,

2129
02:03:20.810 --> 02:03:25.430
but I get it a little too many Birkenstocks and tevarres and girls could use a

2130
02:03:25.431 --> 02:03:28.460
little bit more makeup.
Putting makeup on gals.
It's not load up a little.

2131
02:03:28.461 --> 02:03:32.420
It's not pronounced.
Tiva was Tevez.
Maybe it is divas.

2132
02:03:32.421 --> 02:03:35.840
I Dunno if I've even heard the word and figure weird leather sandals and shit,

2133
02:03:36.170 --> 02:03:39.560
but it's a cool place,
man.
But I think that's what you get.

2134
02:03:39.590 --> 02:03:40.970
If you live around nature,

2135
02:03:40.971 --> 02:03:44.840
you get a bunch of fit people that like hiking and had a lot of north face

2136
02:03:44.841 --> 02:03:49.700
jackets.
You know they got great weather.
Yeah,
yeah,
they'd really do.

2137
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.490
They have blue blizzards and snow storms and shit,

2138
02:03:52.491 --> 02:03:54.550
but they also have like you'll,

2139
02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:59.560
it'll be 30 degrees in Denver or boulder and then the next day it'll be 60 yeah,

2140
02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:01.040
it doesn't make any sense.

2141
02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:05.540
Would you say Denver's the best comedy town in the country?
It's up there.

2142
02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:09.440
It's up there.
I fucking love it there.
I'm going there in August.

2143
02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:13.460
I'm doing that place again.
I fucking love it.
Yeah.

2144
02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:15.890
It's one of my favorite places on the planet period.

2145
02:04:15.891 --> 02:04:19.130
Like if I was going to leave la,
Denver's one of the spots that I would pick.

2146
02:04:19.131 --> 02:04:21.620
I think about like when I mentioned we leave,

2147
02:04:21.621 --> 02:04:24.770
where would I go and Denver's a demos at the top of the list.

2148
02:04:24.771 --> 02:04:28.490
I used to want to go to like Seattle or Portland and then I read that article,

2149
02:04:28.491 --> 02:04:30.340
that terrifying article about how light,

2150
02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:34.520
not just if one talks about the big one earthquake in La and they're like,

2151
02:04:34.521 --> 02:04:38.360
what's really going to fuck shit up is the tsunami that's going to happen on

2152
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:40.770
that bottom line.
They're like Portland and Seattle.

2153
02:04:40.771 --> 02:04:45.120
We're going to be gone with that tsunami 100%.
Right?
100%.
Yeah.

2154
02:04:45.121 --> 02:04:49.930
It's just whether it's a hundred years from now or two [inaudible] but like I

2155
02:04:49.931 --> 02:04:54.600
just,
if we wake up one day and Seattle's gone 13 million people dead,

2156
02:04:55.290 --> 02:04:58.290
it goes deep into Washington state all the way to Tacoma.

2157
02:04:58.291 --> 02:05:00.320
The ocean goes to Tacoma.
Oh,

2158
02:05:00.321 --> 02:05:02.940
that there was an article they like talked about like what,

2159
02:05:02.941 --> 02:05:05.040
how it would happen like one,
one hand,

2160
02:05:05.041 --> 02:05:07.890
like minute by minute in Portland with this,
with this going on.

2161
02:05:07.891 --> 02:05:11.340
It was just terrified.
Yeah.
Fuck that.
Too risky.

2162
02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:13.920
Also seasonal depression is real.
Oh,
for sure.

2163
02:05:14.010 --> 02:05:16.050
I have a buddy of mine who moved to,
um,

2164
02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:20.810
he moved to Portland and started Jujitsu school out there and I was like
delight.

2165
02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:23.250
Like it.
He was like,
dude,
I fucking love it.
I go,
you don't Miss La at all.

2166
02:05:23.251 --> 02:05:26.790
He was like,
no,
I,
what about the reigns and me?
It's like,
no,
no,
it's nothing.

2167
02:05:26.970 --> 02:05:30.150
Two years later,
he's back in La.
I go,
what happened?
He goes,
the fucking weather.

2168
02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:33.120
I go,
you liar.
You were trying to convince me.

2169
02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:35.430
You were trying to tell me and he started laughing.
He's like,

2170
02:05:35.431 --> 02:05:39.570
I'm convincing myself.
Yeah,
but he bought into it.
He goes,
I,
I go,

2171
02:05:39.571 --> 02:05:44.100
what happened is I came back one time and when it was rainy out there and it

2172
02:05:44.101 --> 02:05:47.790
wasn't rainy here and I was like,
what am I doing?
I go,
I'm less happy.

2173
02:05:47.791 --> 02:05:51.990
They're like,
it makes you less happy if it's raining all the time,

2174
02:05:52.170 --> 02:05:55.950
it makes you less happy rain.
If you live in La and it rains,

2175
02:05:55.951 --> 02:05:59.760
we're all happy like,
oh,
this is cool.
It's raining out of vitamin D is important.

2176
02:06:01.110 --> 02:06:03.450
It's not just vitamin D either.
It's just like a feeling.

2177
02:06:03.451 --> 02:06:06.450
You get like you're going to be cold and wet,

2178
02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:10.590
you're going to be cold and wet and you've got to bundle up and get inside

2179
02:06:10.591 --> 02:06:13.250
quickly.
Kid inside.
You can't just be free.

2180
02:06:13.251 --> 02:06:15.990
It can't be outside sitting in the grass eaten lunch.

2181
02:06:16.050 --> 02:06:20.580
So looking out and just relaxing.
Yeah,
I like my hammock.
Yeah.

2182
02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:24.840
Fuck that place.
And then fuck places that have like too much snow too,

2183
02:06:25.370 --> 02:06:27.540
like all the people that want to move back to New York.
I'm like,

2184
02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:31.080
you can keep that.
Good luck with that.
Yeah.
That New York,

2185
02:06:31.110 --> 02:06:33.510
the summer and the winters would kill me in New York.

2186
02:06:33.810 --> 02:06:37.170
I've been waiting for the subway when you're just like dripping sweat was just

2187
02:06:37.171 --> 02:06:41.490
brutal.
Chipping sweat with moist Piss,
smell everywhere,

2188
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.560
that moisture,

2189
02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:47.580
but that's carrying those pis odor molecules and the subway.

2190
02:06:47.581 --> 02:06:50.610
Like what in the fuck are you people breathing in down here?

2191
02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:53.160
And I never got the rubber boots.
You know what I mean?

2192
02:06:53.161 --> 02:06:55.360
I was always just like had sneakers and be like trying to get,

2193
02:06:55.640 --> 02:06:57.720
trying to get to Fallon at like seven in the morning,

2194
02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:01.260
walking to the subway through the slush.
It was like it'd be beautiful,

2195
02:07:01.261 --> 02:07:03.750
wall was snowing and then as soon who was on the ground he would just like get

2196
02:07:03.751 --> 02:07:08.340
rid of this shit.
And now did you write for Fallon?
What was that kick like?

2197
02:07:09.330 --> 02:07:12.330
I mean it was a,
it was frustrating.
They didn't like,

2198
02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:15.830
because I started when he started late night with Jimmy Fallon's,

2199
02:07:15.850 --> 02:07:20.850
I was one of the first guys there and they didn't like any of my jokes.

2200
02:07:21.210 --> 02:07:22.080
Like it was just,
it was,

2201
02:07:22.081 --> 02:07:26.400
it was impossible to mean or just like this is going to make Jimmy unlikable.

2202
02:07:26.401 --> 02:07:31.401
Like it wasn't about being funny so much as like coming off as smart and uh,

2203
02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:36.160
and friendly,
you know,
unlikable the day I was there for a year

2204
02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:40.390
<v 2>and then they barely used anything I ever did,
but they knew I was funny.</v>

2205
02:07:40.391 --> 02:07:43.870
They liked me and I thought for some reason in my head I thought that if I quit

2206
02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:48.160
before a year that it like follow me.
People be like,
what happened with Fallon?

2207
02:07:48.161 --> 02:07:50.830
Why were you only there a year?
That like,
and then when I left,
it was like,

2208
02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:53.590
no one would have given a shit if I'd left after 10 weeks,
you know,

2209
02:07:53.591 --> 02:07:57.300
wouldn't have mattered at all.
Yeah,
it was,
it was good.

2210
02:07:57.310 --> 02:08:01.690
It's an interesting experience,
but I did not enjoy it.

2211
02:08:02.230 --> 02:08:05.990
Being a writer for other people's voices has got to be very difficult.
It's,

2212
02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.120
I mean,
for me it's impossible.

2213
02:08:07.150 --> 02:08:10.000
It's like I write in my voice and you either like it or you don't,

2214
02:08:10.001 --> 02:08:13.780
like I've written for Jimmy Kimmel,
Sarah Silverman,
and they'd,
if I love to joke,

2215
02:08:13.781 --> 02:08:18.300
they loved it too.
Uh,
but with Fallon,
that was not the case.
You know,
it was,

2216
02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:21.760
he was,
it was almost never like a,
he might,
he might,
he would laugh at the joke,

2217
02:08:21.761 --> 02:08:26.080
but he be like,
I can't say this.
I can't do it.
What are they trying to do?

2218
02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:29.170
Like what,
what is he trying to do?
And he's trying to be like Middle America,

2219
02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:31.780
like there's a market for that,
right?
Is that what it is?

2220
02:08:31.810 --> 02:08:35.410
He just wants everyone to love him,
you know,
he just wants everyone to,
uh,

2221
02:08:35.470 --> 02:08:36.303
everyone to love him.

2222
02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:40.510
And that's like not a bad trait to having a late night host.
Right.

2223
02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:42.820
Probably the best trait to having a late night host.

2224
02:08:42.970 --> 02:08:47.290
[inaudible] I'd like to see him drunk one day just shitting on everybody though.

2225
02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:50.500
I think it'd be hilarious.
Hilarious.
Does it do that?
Oh yeah.

2226
02:08:53.130 --> 02:08:56.860
Cause I mean I,
I've heard that he quit drinking.
I don't know if that's true,

2227
02:08:56.861 --> 02:08:59.170
but he would like,
he liked to get drunk and like,

2228
02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:01.840
and like shitty bars and like hang out and like with the,

2229
02:09:01.841 --> 02:09:03.940
with the staff and the crew,
like he was,

2230
02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:06.970
he's like a man of the people and he didn't just want to go home and drink.

2231
02:09:07.210 --> 02:09:11.710
He wanted to go out and go to some weird bar that was like in a subway that no

2232
02:09:11.711 --> 02:09:16.260
one knew about and have beers.
Like he was,
uh,
he was like a fun drunk,
you know.

2233
02:09:16.660 --> 02:09:21.520
But he did a lot.
Yeah.
There was always those rumors that he's got a problem.

2234
02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:26.230
She can balance.
Got a problem.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2235
02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:30.520
Do you think that's like the pressure of just being this like super friendly,

2236
02:09:30.521 --> 02:09:34.990
sweet guy on TV wanting everybody to love you?
They,
you're like,
oh my God,

2237
02:09:34.991 --> 02:09:38.260
get me a fucking drank so I can cut loose.
I'm,
I'm,

2238
02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:40.880
I think that could be part of it,
you know?
That's why I was,

2239
02:09:40.910 --> 02:09:42.520
I was thought like with my persona,

2240
02:09:42.521 --> 02:09:45.130
like let's be the meanest person you can so that you can,

2241
02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:48.460
it allows you to be nice offstage.
You know,
you got cute kind of,

2242
02:09:48.461 --> 02:09:50.230
it gives you a little bit of distance.

2243
02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:55.270
But the guys who come off as like your best friend onstage tend to be monsters

2244
02:09:55.271 --> 02:09:58.690
off stay.
Some of them,
man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got another story.

2245
02:09:58.691 --> 02:10:02.300
I'll tell you when we get off the air about one of those.
Great.
Um,

2246
02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:05.440
well let's wrap this fucking thing up man.
Um,
you're special.

2247
02:10:05.441 --> 02:10:09.640
It's out tonight at midnight.
Yeah.
What's it called?
Fire in the maternity ward.

2248
02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:14.170
And you have Jesus,
once you think of that title,

2249
02:10:14.171 --> 02:10:17.830
you got to go with it every now and then when someone tells you a title,

2250
02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:21.490
a special and you have to,
well that was one of those.
So you got me.
Um,

2251
02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:23.730
you have several though.
So,
um,

2252
02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:25.410
what are the other ones that are available on Netflix now?

2253
02:10:25.690 --> 02:10:28.990
Thoughts and prayers is on Netflix firing the maternity ward comes out tonight.

2254
02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:34.220
I've got a podcast on a comedy central called the Jessalyn and Rosenthal Vanity

2255
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:36.680
<v 0>project.
Oh,
that's right.
Yeah.
Who is it with?</v>

2256
02:10:37.020 --> 02:10:40.820
My friend Greg Rosenthal is a NFL analyst.
We've been best friends since college,

2257
02:10:41.090 --> 02:10:43.850
so we just kind of like,
we were supposed to talk about sports,

2258
02:10:43.851 --> 02:10:47.660
but we just fuck around.
Like we never call talk about scores.
Yeah.
It's fun.

2259
02:10:47.810 --> 02:10:49.910
Beautiful.
All right,
well,
uh,
good luck.

2260
02:10:49.911 --> 02:10:52.280
Good luck with a special thanks for doing this,
man.
I appreciate it.
Yeah.

2261
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:55.070
Great comedy.
And finally be here.
Yeah,
for sure.
And uh,

2262
02:10:55.250 --> 02:10:57.470
I can't recommend his comedy enough.
It was for real.

2263
02:10:57.650 --> 02:11:01.910
If you're a fan of standup comedy,
Anthony Jeselnik is the shit,
so thank you,
sir.

2264
02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:03.320
Thank you,
John.
Bye everybody.
