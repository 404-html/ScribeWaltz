00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.851
Ladies and gentleman,

11
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.910
Fucking house Joe Shillings.

14
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.220
That thing it read and write.

15
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.061
I mean,

16
00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:17.511
I hope not.

17
00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:18.550
I really hurt my ego.

18
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.210
You are light in that fucker on fire.

19
00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:21.260
That thing is not right.

20
00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:23.090
We've got to get that recalibrated chosen.

21
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.471
Chosen here,

22
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:27.260
complaining about a sciatic pain in his hip and still out kicked me.

23
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.561
I'm like,

24
00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.060
what is going on out here?

25
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.170
Most sweaty.

26
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.670
Forget about cyanic pain.

27
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.541
Daniel Straus.

28
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:34.160
You've gone through some fucking pain,

29
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:34.610
dude.

30
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.390
You are defying science and doctors and that David talent,

31
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.621
you,

32
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:40.454
it was over.

33
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.350
Tell everybody the whole story.

34
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.220
Put this,

35
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.100
bring this sucker up here,

36
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:44.290
right

37
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.350
<v 0>how the story goes.</v>

38
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.923
I was out one night,

39
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:47.201
buddy.

40
00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:49.690
Your mom's having trouble and needed somebody to go out with them.

41
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:50.524
So,

42
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.070
uh,

43
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.750
it was around the city that night.

44
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.740
And um,

45
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.080
after taking him home we were leaving the highway.

46
00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.530
How's it split off?

47
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.520
I was coming around was like,

48
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.150
yeah,

49
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.270
I was on a bike and I had a passenger.

50
00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:09.271
So what was called eight 26 is the highway as a splits off to 95.

51
00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:10.331
I was going around eight,

52
00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:11.164
26.

53
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.740
Now here's the tricky part.

54
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.390
Don't really remember what's going on from there.

55
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.260
So the what me and the passenger of,

56
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.140
remember we were hit from either the side or from the back.

57
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.280
Um,

58
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.360
but coming around the bin,

59
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.721
boom,

60
00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:26.420
coming around,

61
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.640
it got pushed into the wall.

62
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.940
I wake up under the,

63
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:29.460
uh,

64
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.293
go out real,

65
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.263
can't move,

66
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.220
you know,

67
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.770
uh,

68
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.720
nobody else is there and the car is gone.

69
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.310
There was not really a witness there until like later pulling up behind us.

70
00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:41.410
So it fucked me up for a while.

71
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.921
I mean,

72
00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:42.910
fuck me up right now,

73
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.300
but,

74
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.133
you know,

75
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.830
uh,

76
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.560
getting back to just what it is,

77
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.640
the body's healing.

78
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:48.474
And then,

79
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.740
so what was the extent of your injuries?

80
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.071
All right.

81
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:51.491
So,

82
00:01:51.491 --> 00:01:51.910
uh,

83
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.331
I had,

84
00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:53.164
um,

85
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.810
in my c four,

86
00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:56.770
five and six,

87
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.550
uh,

88
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.480
I had contusions on my spinal cord and half of my,

89
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.450
on the left side of my spinal cord,

90
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:03.240
it was,

91
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.760
uh,

92
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.090
pressure so bad that it like shut down my whole nervous system.

93
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.260
Like all my body.

94
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.311
So,

95
00:02:09.311 --> 00:02:09.880
uh,

96
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.460
am I up in my neck and then my middle of my back was just compressed a lot of

97
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:16.090
the swelling and that's what,

98
00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:16.660
uh,

99
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.800
caused a lot of the,

100
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.550
you know,

101
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.590
not being able to walk,

102
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:22.090
not being able to feel that nervous problems.

103
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.920
Never system that I have are the nervous,

104
00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:24.370
uh,

105
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.270
issues that I had.

106
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:27.430
So what did they do to fix it?

107
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.790
I've been rehabbing a,

108
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:31.810
they wanted to do surgery right away,

109
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.970
but how many months ago was this?

110
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.170
This was in December [inaudible] 17.

111
00:02:35.171 --> 00:02:36.004
So,

112
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.383
um,

113
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.490
they wanted to do re,

114
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.780
uh,

115
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.550
they wanted her to do a surgery immediately.

116
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.810
You know what I'm trying to tell him,

117
00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:43.931
like,

118
00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:44.281
no,

119
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:45.100
I'm,

120
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.090
I'm trying to fight again,

121
00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:46.221
blah,

122
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:46.391
blah,

123
00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:46.840
blah.

124
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.600
What kind of surgery?

125
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.433
Fuse,

126
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.440
that's what they wanted to do.

127
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.070
They wanted to go in and take the,

128
00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:51.904
I think the,

129
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.260
I want to say the three to five or four to six or something fuse out altogether,

130
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.630
which obviously there's no rain that's,

131
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.680
and it's a big spot.

132
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:03.514
So,

133
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.911
uh,

134
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:06.490
wasn't trying to have that looked up for,

135
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.140
we looked for a couple of rehab places and eventually got hooked up with a place

136
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:13.270
called a Neil fit three 60.

137
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.740
So I've been rehabbing there since the accident and I mean it's,

138
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.360
it's in Pembroke pines,

139
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:20.140
Florida,

140
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.010
close to Miami,

141
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.270
a great crew.

142
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.990
Um,

143
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.291
but yeah,

144
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:24.910
they've been giving me back in the game.

145
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.511
I've been a,

146
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:29.530
I was doing that extensively every day for like two days a week,

147
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:31.390
two hour or couple of hours a day,

148
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.171
you know,

149
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:34.840
two to three times a day kind of shit that they do for your neck.

150
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.960
Uh,

151
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.150
for more for me,

152
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:39.430
first we had to start with um,

153
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.941
you know,

154
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:41.490
just uh,

155
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.960
the fine motor stuff,

156
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.160
touching,

157
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.880
feeling,

158
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.181
you know,

159
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:48.280
I had problems where it's my sensitivities.

160
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.480
So like you wake up under the guard rail,

161
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.010
you know,

162
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.950
you guys don't remember what happened when you wake up in the hospital.

163
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.953
What did they tell you?

164
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.121
Four,

165
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:56.080
they got all this stuff.

166
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:56.914
They were like,

167
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.420
oh to walk cause you feel,

168
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:00.370
could you like how were you when you woke up?

169
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.030
Because for me,

170
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.600
um,

171
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.433
when I woke up,

172
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.610
boom.

173
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.881
Yeah.

174
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:05.740
So back to the store when I woke up,

175
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.900
when I woke up,

176
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.833
help.

177
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.100
So I woke up and uh,

178
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.791
you know,

179
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:15.490
I had my helmet on but I couldn't move my legs.

180
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.863
Um,

181
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.030
my passenger had one over top.

182
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.860
She had,

183
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.140
uh,

184
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.341
her,

185
00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:20.831
her hands,

186
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:22.210
so she wasn't like extremely,

187
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.260
but she had went out too.

188
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:26.050
So I couldn't really feel nothing cause see nothing.

189
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:28.360
I was just telling him to get my helmet off and get my helmet off.

190
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.760
Finally a truck had pulled up and a seeing that we were in an accident and they,

191
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.570
what they shouldn't,

192
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.540
shouldn't do but pull me out and uh,

193
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.680
yeah cause I was,

194
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.593
you know,

195
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.913
get me out of here,

196
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.450
you know,

197
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.290
I was freaking out.

198
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.690
They pulled me out from under it and uh,

199
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.703
you know,

200
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.570
going to the hospital,

201
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.433
that whole,

202
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.760
the scary part was,

203
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:55.150
was knowing nothing was broke but not being able to feel nothing.

204
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.680
Trying to wipe my face or trying to grab something and he just couldn't move

205
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:01.450
your mind in my head and my head,

206
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:03.100
I'll move my leg or move my arm.

207
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.330
Nothing's going on.

208
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.080
You know what I'm saying?

209
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.340
So you're thinking you're paralyzed.

210
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.283
I'm going.

211
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.870
That's a wrap.

212
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.720
Like Paul Williams,

213
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.590
just like fuck.

214
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.090
So I get to the,

215
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:13.330
uh,

216
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.710
hospital finally.

217
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:15.220
Um,

218
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.461
you know,

219
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:17.770
they're trying to work on me and uh,

220
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.760
seeing the doctors,

221
00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:19.331
he's telling me,

222
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:20.164
well,

223
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.351
you know,

224
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:21.310
because of my neck,

225
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:23.020
it's unlikely that I'll be,

226
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.380
you know,

227
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.760
walking anytime soon.

228
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.690
No,

229
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.291
a couple of days,

230
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:27.520
couple of weeks ago after that,

231
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.721
you know,

232
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:29.554
just banging out.

233
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.040
And in the meantime I'm trying to explain to them I'm an athlete.

234
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.420
I know you see this,

235
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.240
I've been through this type of incident before.

236
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.871
You know,

237
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:38.651
I grew up wrestling,

238
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:39.484
I'm from Cincinnati,

239
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.211
grew up wrestling,

240
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:43.900
so I've had neck problems for fuck my whole life,

241
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.793
you know what I mean?

242
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.521
And,

243
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:45.760
uh,

244
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.280
so I'm trying to explain to him like,

245
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:47.710
uh,

246
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.543
you know,

247
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:49.451
chill out.

248
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:50.380
Just give me some time.

249
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:51.160
Let me,

250
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.210
let me work something out.

251
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.830
I don't want to do the surgery right now.

252
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.670
I really want to,

253
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.130
they want you to do it in the hospital right there.

254
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.801
Right.

255
00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:57.200
Then there,

256
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.070
there is no other,

257
00:05:58.071 --> 00:05:58.371
you know,

258
00:05:58.371 --> 00:05:59.240
there's no other choice.

259
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:00.230
You never going to walk a game.

260
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.700
You got to go back to them right now and go,

261
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:02.380
hey motherfucker,

262
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.720
look,

263
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.930
look,

264
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.763
it was walking around.

265
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.181
You know what I mean?

266
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:08.390
And it's been like that majority of times in my career where I've done

267
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:08.751
something,

268
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:09.440
something's happened.

269
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.591
Oh,

270
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:10.730
you're not going to be able to do this.

271
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.810
You got me fucked up.

272
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.050
He's hitting pads with me at the gym yesterday,

273
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.090
sparring.

274
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.680
This happened in fucking December.

275
00:06:16.681 --> 00:06:17.514
That's insane.

276
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.373
It's just insane.

277
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.710
It just makes me sick that they always want to cut you immediately when it comes

278
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:22.544
to those things,

279
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.470
kind of bulging disc issue,

280
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.610
they want to get in there and it,

281
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.670
it's hurtful to us because,

282
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:29.061
you know,

283
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:30.530
I understand they got a job to do,

284
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:32.300
but do your job.

285
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.630
Right.

286
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.321
You know what I mean?

287
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:36.740
Like they have the one method is Thursday.

288
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.023
So,

289
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.840
um,

290
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.201
but yeah,

291
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:39.741
like I said,

292
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:42.080
I was rehabbing a neuro fit three,

293
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:42.441
six d,

294
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:46.190
which is just the great death physical therapy place down there and Pembro prize

295
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.540
and uh,

296
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:47.991
you know,

297
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.250
I've been getting back with,

298
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.000
uh,

299
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.241
you know,

300
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:53.630
they had me strengthened my neck with just small exercises.

301
00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:54.111
Like I said,

302
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:58.280
I started with fine motor stuff while I had to work on a lot of balance stuff,

303
00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.061
you know.

304
00:06:59.061 --> 00:06:59.660
Um,

305
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.100
you ever fuck with that iron neck thing?

306
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.090
You ever used that thing yet?

307
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.340
No.

308
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.820
Have not used one out here.

309
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.530
I'm try if you want to mess around with it and he's fantastic.

310
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.833
Fantastic.

311
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:09.620
Low too.

312
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.100
So you are six months out now.

313
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.270
Six months out.

314
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.560
Start walking again.

315
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.300
It took me,

316
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.080
uh,

317
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.790
like even now I'm still like trying to get the form right.

318
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.241
But uh,

319
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:26.090
it took me about three months because she was like,

320
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:26.441
read,

321
00:07:26.441 --> 00:07:27.620
learning how to tie your shoe.

322
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.260
We learned how to tie your shoe in my hand.

323
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.011
My Motor,

324
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:33.230
like my hand wasn't moving his right,

325
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.460
it wasn't working as good.

326
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.833
Um,

327
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.261
it's just,

328
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:38.090
everything's slowed down for me because of him,

329
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.200
because of my spinal cord.

330
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:40.034
So wow.

331
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.210
You know,

332
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.500
that is the most for me was the scariest part because I was everything so

333
00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:46.190
unsure,

334
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.000
you know what I mean?

335
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.290
The most recent MRI,

336
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.100
when did you get,

337
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:49.820
have you gotten more,

338
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.330
uh,

339
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.280
gobble in about a month and a half ago?

340
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:53.720
Ever since look good.

341
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:54.500
It looks good.

342
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:54.750
Every,

343
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.311
all the swollen.

344
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:56.144
His went down.

345
00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.790
The left side is clear.

346
00:07:59.140 --> 00:07:59.460
Uh,

347
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.620
the only way I can explain it,

348
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:01.160
there's two,

349
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:01.790
there's two,

350
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.510
two months,

351
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.340
white lines and it gets blocked.

352
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.180
You know what I'm saying?

353
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.410
That's where the fluids coming down.

354
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.960
My left side of my,

355
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.890
on the fluid was being blocked.

356
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:14.180
So now I'm having a clear line of fluid going down my spinal cord.

357
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.380
Now it's just about healing,

358
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.783
which,

359
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.331
you know,

360
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:20.300
I've been working that and that's the part to get overcome.

361
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:20.631
You know,

362
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:21.411
the healing part,

363
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:22.244
the,

364
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.340
the neurological part and the nerves and all that part that goes with it.

365
00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:26.780
It's the body that can only,

366
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.790
there's not too much that I can do to,

367
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.070
to tell this other than,

368
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.560
you know,

369
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.393
eating right.

370
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.290
All of the simple shit.

371
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:34.640
But it's the body.

372
00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:35.474
That's Helen.

373
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.040
That's crazy that you're sparring.

374
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:38.301
Yeah,

375
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:40.710
I do a lot of things I shouldn't do now.

376
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.550
He's partying with friends so you know that everything's going to be cool.

377
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.413
I mean,

378
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:45.740
good training partners.

379
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.770
So I was born down at Henry who's h kickboxing was training down there.

380
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.891
Um,

381
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:52.610
so,

382
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:52.821
you know,

383
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:53.800
I live in Fort Lauderdale,

384
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.643
so,

385
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:55.141
you know,

386
00:08:55.141 --> 00:08:55.800
that's,

387
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.041
you know,

388
00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:57.360
working out with those guys,

389
00:08:57.361 --> 00:08:57.661
you know,

390
00:08:57.661 --> 00:09:00.780
no one's out there to hurt me or tried to get me hurt or injured.

391
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:04.650
Everyone's had a lot of respect and love seeing me back.

392
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:08.070
So I've never been in a situation where I'm trying to go super hard.

393
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.641
Not yet,

394
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:09.474
but I love to.

395
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:09.921
<v 2>Right.</v>

396
00:09:09.921 --> 00:09:10.754
Well,

397
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:11.683
you can get it.

398
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.693
Let me know.

399
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:14.670
We can get it.

400
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.630
<v 1>So when you hit in the bag or hitting pads,</v>

401
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.780
you feel like you have full strength.

402
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:19.480
<v 0>Um,</v>

403
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:19.950
no,

404
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:20.070
no,

405
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.291
no.

406
00:09:20.291 --> 00:09:23.080
And that's the thing that I'm excited about.

407
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.990
I'm a broken toward that is dying to be fixed.

408
00:09:25.991 --> 00:09:26.471
You know what I mean?

409
00:09:26.471 --> 00:09:27.970
Cause I'm a brand new,

410
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:28.691
you know,

411
00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:29.980
I can be fixed in any way.

412
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.710
Like I'm relearning everything.

413
00:09:32.711 --> 00:09:33.131
I'm not,

414
00:09:33.131 --> 00:09:33.401
you know,

415
00:09:33.401 --> 00:09:34.630
it's not like I can't box,

416
00:09:34.631 --> 00:09:36.010
it's not like I can't wrestle,

417
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.430
but it's now just relearning the,

418
00:09:39.431 --> 00:09:39.930
you know,

419
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.300
<v 1>the mechanics of making your brain knows how to do it,</v>

420
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.650
but your body's got to relearn it.

421
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:44.650
<v 0>Exactly why.</v>

422
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.820
And it's like the nerve,

423
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.510
the nerve stuffs is on the right side of your body.

424
00:09:49.511 --> 00:09:49.740
Right,

425
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:49.860
right.

426
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.530
It's like muscle memory coming back.

427
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.930
Even yesterday I was holding pads from like,

428
00:09:52.931 --> 00:09:54.580
his job was a little weak and like his,

429
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:55.460
his uh,

430
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.940
lifting of his foot or whatever the thing we were trying to do.

431
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.800
But once as we were doing it,

432
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.840
once he felt the right way to do it,

433
00:10:01.841 --> 00:10:02.650
then he can repeat it.

434
00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:03.483
You know what I mean?

435
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:04.723
I think that's a lot.

436
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.510
So it was lots of did it and this big for me,

437
00:10:07.511 --> 00:10:07.800
man,

438
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.820
I really want to be back in,

439
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.680
in the cage by the end of this year.

440
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:12.640
Really.

441
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.300
You know what I mean?

442
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.210
I want to be fighting about an issue and it's not impossible.

443
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:16.811
<v 1>Well,</v>

444
00:10:16.811 --> 00:10:17.980
you got a great attitude,

445
00:10:17.981 --> 00:10:18.251
man.

446
00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:19.330
This idea that you love it,

447
00:10:19.331 --> 00:10:21.820
that you're a broken toy and you're going to rebuild it and fix it.

448
00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:26.170
And it's exciting because it gives you an opportunity to kind of start again.

449
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.070
<v 0>I mean,</v>

450
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.370
that's been my whole life my whole life.

451
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.760
So I'm just there again at this point in my career.

452
00:10:33.761 --> 00:10:38.761
And unfortunately this had to happen for me to turn the corner and get focused

453
00:10:38.921 --> 00:10:39.671
in another way.

454
00:10:39.671 --> 00:10:40.391
But you know,

455
00:10:40.391 --> 00:10:41.830
it's just what it has to be.

456
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.560
<v 1>But it's so exciting that you have this attitude that's the,</v>

457
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:46.730
that's the cool thing about it.

458
00:10:46.731 --> 00:10:47.331
It's like you're not,

459
00:10:47.331 --> 00:10:48.170
woe is me.

460
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:48.831
You're like,

461
00:10:48.831 --> 00:10:49.490
Hey,

462
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:50.450
I'm on a rebuild,

463
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.770
but I'm gonna get right back in there.

464
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.720
<v 0>Hey Man.</v>

465
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.553
I mean,

466
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.030
<v 1>you must be so excited that you could just do everything again.</v>

467
00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:57.980
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

468
00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:58.601
You know what I mean?

469
00:10:58.601 --> 00:11:02.420
Like first was fun and now what work had been making sure to Dick work

470
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.333
<v 2>first,</v>

471
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.243
it was like,

472
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.313
all right,

473
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.100
always fuck off my back,

474
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.020
making sure I can do shit.

475
00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:16.893
Yeah.

476
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.720
<v 0>You know,</v>

477
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.350
the first,

478
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.620
you know,

479
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.620
first couple of months it was just brutal,

480
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.041
you know,

481
00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:25.810
not being a weapon of mass coming to eat

482
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.140
<v 1>in this.</v>

483
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.800
Did it slowly start to come back where you got like some motion dude.

484
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:32.740
<v 0>Well and I've had um,</v>

485
00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:33.521
a lot of,

486
00:11:33.521 --> 00:11:34.030
uh,

487
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.370
I think it's just the notice files,

488
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.950
the gnosis wrestling for 40 years,

489
00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:39.551
you know what I mean?

490
00:11:39.551 --> 00:11:40.360
Source.

491
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.193
Um,

492
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.460
do you do any decompression?

493
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:46.690
I do a little bit here and there and whenever I can get to the chiropractors I'm

494
00:11:46.691 --> 00:11:48.260
doing some or you know,

495
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.121
like I said,

496
00:11:49.121 --> 00:11:50.350
it's been bad for you.

497
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.010
<v 1>Have you seen that thing you hook up to your neck and yet hang from a doorway,</v>

498
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.863
<v 0>stretch it.</v>

499
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.670
<v 3>Do I do that same thing with a rolled up towel or bang it from the doorway and</v>

500
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:01.800
it helps mind tremendously.

501
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.753
But I got mine,

502
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.640
I'm sure from fighting.

503
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:06.030
But then also like I'll lay on my back at night,

504
00:12:06.031 --> 00:12:06.864
I'll watch

505
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.370
for like two weeks.

506
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.223
My neck will be all,

507
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:11.500
you know,

508
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.371
isn't it crazy?

509
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:15.850
You're a professional fight or you fuck up your back watching youtube videos?

510
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:16.684
For sure.

511
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.583
For sure.

512
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.633
But everyone was doing it.

513
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:18.890
<v 0>Man.</v>

514
00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:23.840
That's all we do is take the whole world is doing it is people's necks are

515
00:12:23.841 --> 00:12:24.650
changing.

516
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:25.220
Yeah.

517
00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.320
It's terrible if it wasn't for like,

518
00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:27.951
you know,

519
00:12:27.951 --> 00:12:31.270
being new awareness that I have now for like my neck and neck injuries,

520
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.990
just seeing a lot of things.

521
00:12:32.991 --> 00:12:36.290
I'm like trying to posture up and just see you and shit cause I'm just,

522
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.390
I'm always like this,

523
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:39.530
always heard,

524
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.251
always hurting him.

525
00:12:40.251 --> 00:12:41.030
So,

526
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.241
you know,

527
00:12:41.241 --> 00:12:45.380
it's been one thing after another four years and that's actually leading into

528
00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:45.830
this,

529
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:46.663
you know,

530
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.340
this accident with a or this injury,

531
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:50.170
you know,

532
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:50.630
um,

533
00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:51.840
try to keep this mic closer

534
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.293
to you.

535
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.020
So are you,

536
00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:56.960
how old are you now Daniel?

537
00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.450
I am 33.

538
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.320
I'll be 34.

539
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.410
I'm at that age where you forget how old you are.

540
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.010
Yeah.

541
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:04.431
So,

542
00:13:04.431 --> 00:13:04.641
uh,

543
00:13:04.641 --> 00:13:06.260
I'll be 34 in July.

544
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:07.440
Well you're,

545
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.470
you're healthy and you know,

546
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.280
the ability to recuperate from something that's that devastating,

547
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.230
that quickly shows what could of shape you're in.

548
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.070
That must have a big impact on your rehab process.

549
00:13:19.071 --> 00:13:19.280
Right?

550
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.113
Does it does,

551
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.510
I mean,

552
00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.510
a regular person that has that kind of injury probably is not going to bounce

553
00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:24.344
back like that.

554
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:25.220
Not as quickly.

555
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:26.011
I mean,

556
00:13:26.011 --> 00:13:26.301
being,

557
00:13:26.301 --> 00:13:26.811
like I said,

558
00:13:26.811 --> 00:13:29.300
being an athlete has helped me tremendously.

559
00:13:29.301 --> 00:13:30.111
I mean with my neck,

560
00:13:30.111 --> 00:13:33.080
Korean obviously as strong as it was,

561
00:13:33.081 --> 00:13:33.410
the,

562
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:33.860
you know,

563
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.750
the damage would have been worse.

564
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:36.643
But,

565
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:37.160
uh,

566
00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.220
being able to bounce backwards been,

567
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:39.561
you know,

568
00:13:39.561 --> 00:13:40.281
being young,

569
00:13:40.281 --> 00:13:41.114
being able to,

570
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.550
I put my body through so much that this is,

571
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:44.360
yeah.

572
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.200
Compared to what,

573
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.710
you know,

574
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:46.281
it's been through.

575
00:13:46.281 --> 00:13:47.450
So yeah,

576
00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:51.050
being young it's definitely helped me and I'm trying to keep that,

577
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.943
that,

578
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.880
that time away,

579
00:13:52.881 --> 00:13:53.750
but you know,

580
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.270
so how will you know when you can get back in there?

581
00:13:56.271 --> 00:13:57.230
Are you wrestling yet?

582
00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:57.910
Yeah.

583
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.210
Wrestling and doing everything.

584
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.980
He restaurant Breslin Russell.

585
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:02.670
Yeah.

586
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:03.360
Wow.

587
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.040
Um,

588
00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.930
nervous about getting your neck Yank Dawn.

589
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.460
And I was nervous before,

590
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.121
you know what I mean?

591
00:14:08.121 --> 00:14:11.750
But now I'm just getting confident with getting my neck strong,

592
00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:16.270
making sure I don't do the stupid moves I've been doing the caused the injury.

593
00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:16.930
So,

594
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:17.763
um,

595
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.270
my next step is just being clear,

596
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.070
being seen by a doctor,

597
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.600
a neurologist.

598
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.321
Yes.

599
00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:25.154
He can fight,

600
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.013
sign off,

601
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.320
let's get back to business.

602
00:14:27.321 --> 00:14:27.740
So,

603
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.230
and how's bell toward treating all of this great man.

604
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.670
I can't say anything negative about them because they've always done nothing but

605
00:14:34.671 --> 00:14:36.060
help me out in situations.

606
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:36.890
Uh,

607
00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:37.071
you know,

608
00:14:37.071 --> 00:14:38.840
I've been with them for some time,

609
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:39.381
you know,

610
00:14:39.381 --> 00:14:40.130
and uh,

611
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.940
two times world champion if y'all motherfuckers didn't know.

612
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.383
<v 3>But uh,</v>

613
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.673
yeah,

614
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:50.180
they've

615
00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:50.631
<v 1>always,</v>

616
00:14:50.631 --> 00:14:51.464
they've always,

617
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.020
they've always been fair to me.

618
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:55.100
That's great.

619
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.260
Obviously you've always had problems here and there,

620
00:14:57.261 --> 00:14:58.940
but I've never really had any major,

621
00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.833
you know,

622
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.520
Scott Coker?

623
00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.410
I do too.

624
00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.250
So I always been good to me.

625
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.920
I hear nothing but good things too about how they treat people.

626
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:09.140
Like guys who have gone over there said it's a,

627
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:12.320
it's just a huge relief to get treated with respect.

628
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:12.711
You know,

629
00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:14.480
like they were a little nervous about going over there.

630
00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.000
All right,

631
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.680
right.

632
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:15.921
You know,

633
00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:16.940
a lot of people would always asking,

634
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.250
Hey,

635
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:17.711
what do you want it?

636
00:15:17.711 --> 00:15:18.020
I'm like,

637
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:18.350
Eh,

638
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.190
this is home for me.

639
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:19.941
You know what I mean?

640
00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:24.941
Like the all ideal for everybody would be bell toward gets to the same state as

641
00:15:25.071 --> 00:15:25.730
the UFC,

642
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:26.481
the same level.

643
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:27.320
That would be ideal.

644
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.770
That would help the world.

645
00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.120
Like if you see Gennady Golovkin fighting Canelo Alvarez,

646
00:15:32.121 --> 00:15:36.440
you don't give a fuck if it's golden boy versus Bob Arum course that they want

647
00:15:36.441 --> 00:15:37.540
to see too far.

648
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.720
Champions go after it.

649
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:39.440
That's,

650
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.670
that's what everybody wants to see.

651
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:41.691
Ultimately.

652
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.700
That's what I would like to see across the board.

653
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.331
You know,

654
00:15:44.331 --> 00:15:45.920
I mean I don't think it harms anybody.

655
00:15:45.921 --> 00:15:47.120
I think it helps everybody.

656
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.023
Definitely good.

657
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.090
Better for everybody.

658
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.740
It's better for the athletes for sure.

659
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.281
You know,

660
00:15:52.281 --> 00:15:54.920
and the more money that's gets thrown around and the more,

661
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:55.840
I mean if,

662
00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.080
if a superstar merges from Bella tour that's at the same level that Rhonda was

663
00:16:00.081 --> 00:16:01.370
or Connor is or something like that,

664
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:02.750
that's great for everybody.

665
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:03.681
For everybody.

666
00:16:03.681 --> 00:16:04.310
And you know,

667
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.510
there's a possibility there too.

668
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.000
I mean Michael Van and pages,

669
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.770
he's getting a lot of mainstream press.

670
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.350
People were paying attention to him now cause the other crazy shit he doesn't.

671
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:13.070
That's all right.

672
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:13.903
We need more of that.

673
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.660
I thought he actually had retired from him and may cause boxed for awhile,

674
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.210
like retired from them may box to something.

675
00:16:20.211 --> 00:16:21.044
Nothing.

676
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:21.913
You know what man,

677
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.753
dude like that.

678
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.400
Probably when we retire and unretired just for the press,

679
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.400
<v 3>you know,</v>

680
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.510
it just seems to be the thing have is a lot

681
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.860
speaking and retiring and retiring.

682
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.440
Joe Shelan back to MMA.

683
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.520
I know you competed in the high rollers event this weekend,

684
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:36.981
which by the way,

685
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:38.360
Eddie Bravo told me he was so high,

686
00:16:38.361 --> 00:16:39.350
he thought it was going to jail.

687
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.400
He told me,

688
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:40.761
he goes,

689
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:44.510
I was convinced I was going to jail because I was so paranoid.

690
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.740
It was such a cool event.

691
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.080
It really was the event for people don't know what the fuck we're talking about

692
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:49.971
as an event.

693
00:16:49.971 --> 00:16:54.971
Put on my mat style and a big lawn on my buddies.

694
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.310
The Coldwell high rollers and it's a cannabis infused,

695
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.290
a Jujitsu tournament is with nick all day.

696
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.153
You know,

697
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.650
what are those two dudes that slapped each other and then they,

698
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.990
they smoked a joint together.

699
00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.870
He knew there something in between and then they stepped out with a joint.

700
00:17:08.871 --> 00:17:09.081
I mean,

701
00:17:09.081 --> 00:17:09.770
it was good though.

702
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:10.790
Before every match,

703
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:13.130
everybody smoked like kind of smoked together.

704
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.910
The whole event is kind of this thing.

705
00:17:14.911 --> 00:17:15.920
There was no alcohol.

706
00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:16.970
The vibe was super chill.

707
00:17:16.971 --> 00:17:17.810
They played um,

708
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:19.610
like a hip hop in the background.

709
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:20.410
It was wow.

710
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.100
It was like kind of press star studded event.

711
00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:23.090
It was really fucking cool.

712
00:17:23.091 --> 00:17:23.331
Is it?

713
00:17:23.331 --> 00:17:26.360
That is by far the coolest martial arts event I've ever been to.

714
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:28.420
It was dope.

715
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:29.770
<v 1>Shout out to the DJ man.</v>

716
00:17:29.771 --> 00:17:32.910
He did like eight hours straight playing the same song.

717
00:17:32.911 --> 00:17:35.200
Like only twice paid it twice,

718
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:35.880
right?

719
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.713
I'm off always dope.

720
00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:37.340
Oh really?

721
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.280
Oh thing get Bollix it was it.

722
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:41.950
It's a weird connection.

723
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:46.390
Marijuana with Jujitsu and it's always been there and people that don't know if

724
00:17:46.391 --> 00:17:47.500
people that don't smoke weed,

725
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:48.760
I have to tell them that.

726
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.010
Look that his Jeff Glover

727
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.750
<v 4>and his opponent smoking weed.</v>

728
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.820
It's hilarious man.

729
00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:58.200
It is really,

730
00:17:58.201 --> 00:17:59.820
really fun and that they're doing that man.

731
00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:00.660
But I like it.

732
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:00.911
Oh,

733
00:18:00.911 --> 00:18:01.880
why is your real cool event?

734
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.100
It was real cool Jujitsu and we'd have always been connected.

735
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.740
As long as I've been doing Jujitsu.

736
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.920
People smoked pot in the parking lot and then went in and rolled.

737
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:11.730
Right.

738
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:16.730
That's still do kickboxing apparently is the same way because it's how you

739
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.300
practice focus.

740
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.140
I always found that I'm not good at learning when I'm high or maybe I get too

741
00:18:25.141 --> 00:18:27.090
high and I can't learn like,

742
00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:29.630
like some old show me something and I'm not sure where to put my legs.

743
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:30.450
Like what do I do?

744
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:31.320
Step over here,

745
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.520
what I put my right foot,

746
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:33.030
what?

747
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:33.270
Yeah.

748
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.103
I find that,

749
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.210
but when I'm rolling,

750
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.040
if I'm rolling high then it just,

751
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:39.170
you just get into that zone

752
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.420
<v 0>rubbing like a few,</v>

753
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:41.691
you know,

754
00:18:41.691 --> 00:18:42.620
like when they say like,

755
00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:43.454
uh,

756
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.360
if you take a,

757
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.340
if when you study for a test,

758
00:18:46.341 --> 00:18:48.960
you're sucking on peppermint and then the day of the test you take pepper,

759
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.110
you like suck on peppermint.

760
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.140
You supposed to help you remember?

761
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.570
<v 4>Oh yeah.</v>

762
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:53.150
Yeah.

763
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:54.170
I feel like that's kind of how it is

764
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:54.541
<v 0>with,</v>

765
00:18:54.541 --> 00:18:55.374
uh,

766
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.191
with martial arts.

767
00:18:56.191 --> 00:18:56.731
For me anyway,

768
00:18:56.731 --> 00:19:00.990
like I'm high as fuck and I'm kind of like just a programming into my deep

769
00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:02.130
subconscious or whatever.

770
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.060
Yeah,

771
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.540
I know.

772
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.800
That's my thought.

773
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.040
Maybe you think smoking all the time when you try and then smoking,

774
00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:08.851
not smoking.

775
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:09.684
When you performed,

776
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.020
do you think that has a like a positive or negative effect?

777
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.320
Uh,

778
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.153
<v 4>I don't know.</v>

779
00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.000
I don't really,

780
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:17.480
well,

781
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.313
well let me ask you this.

782
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.410
The first time I felt towards said we're not testing for weed.

783
00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:22.520
You could fight high as fuck.

784
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.740
What would you do that smoked that day?

785
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:25.580
Whoo.

786
00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.640
I wouldn't smoke probably 10 minutes before I got out of shit going on in my

787
00:19:28.641 --> 00:19:29.474
head.

788
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.830
This is cool.

789
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:31.663
This is cool.

790
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:33.080
The high rollers with that.

791
00:19:33.081 --> 00:19:33.500
But like,

792
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:33.941
yeah,

793
00:19:33.941 --> 00:19:34.430
it's different.

794
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:35.710
Lot of money on the line through it fight.

795
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.040
Yeah.

796
00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.873
Well it's also,

797
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.340
you know,

798
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.500
the consequences are a lot different,

799
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.190
you know,

800
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.720
zigging and zagging Rhett's a lot different when you kicks and punches are being

801
00:19:44.721 --> 00:19:45.080
thrown.

802
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:45.261
Yeah,

803
00:19:45.261 --> 00:19:46.094
for sure.

804
00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:47.270
For sure.

805
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.810
Well remember when Nate d or nick rather a fuck go me nick.

806
00:19:50.811 --> 00:19:51.870
Fuck me home.

807
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.401
Well,

808
00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:52.581
I mean,

809
00:19:52.581 --> 00:19:53.670
I know nick and I,

810
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:54.890
if you asked him that question,

811
00:19:54.891 --> 00:19:55.111
he's like,

812
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:55.221
oh,

813
00:19:55.221 --> 00:19:55.971
have you spoken to right there?

814
00:19:55.971 --> 00:19:56.804
And like he would for sure.

815
00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:57.880
For sure.

816
00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.620
100% I bet he would fight better.

817
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:01.760
Probably.

818
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:01.941
Yeah.

819
00:20:01.941 --> 00:20:02.774
Not a fan of it.

820
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.770
You're not a fan of fighting.

821
00:20:03.771 --> 00:20:03.990
Hi.

822
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.310
No,

823
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.640
no,

824
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.360
no fault.

825
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.193
One time.

826
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:07.623
<v 0>What happened?</v>

827
00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:07.991
Well,

828
00:20:07.991 --> 00:20:08.824
for once,

829
00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.620
for once I went through the crowd instead of the,

830
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.953
the walkway.

831
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:16.803
<v 4>Well,</v>

832
00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.280
how did you do,

833
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.113
do it

834
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.880
<v 0>like you,</v>

835
00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:22.760
you're supposed to come out.

836
00:20:22.761 --> 00:20:23.710
It was at shark fights.

837
00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:24.280
Okay.

838
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.113
And uh,

839
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.530
you'd come out and then you go at an l shape and go straight to the cage.

840
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:29.850
Right.

841
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:30.490
I came out,

842
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.440
the ushers always fuck that shit up though.

843
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.680
That's happened like every time he tried to walk out the cage the wrong way.

844
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.120
Anyway,

845
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.680
so I came out just the crowd sitting there and just beeline straight to the

846
00:20:41.681 --> 00:20:42.041
crowd.

847
00:20:42.041 --> 00:20:42.640
Excuse me.

848
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.473
Excuse me.

849
00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:44.141
Stepping over.

850
00:20:44.141 --> 00:20:45.790
People got to the cage,

851
00:20:45.791 --> 00:20:47.050
like stepped over the fence.

852
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.153
Check me out.

853
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.011
Got it down.

854
00:20:49.011 --> 00:20:49.280
I'm like,

855
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:49.690
God,

856
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:50.890
I remember shark fights.

857
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.001
That was a bud.

858
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:52.840
Brotzmann his thing.

859
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.300
He's a buddy of mine.

860
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:55.990
Bullshit.

861
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.081
Yeah.

862
00:20:56.081 --> 00:20:58.420
He was one of the original guys that own king of the cage.

863
00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:58.990
Was it?

864
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.211
Yeah,

865
00:20:59.211 --> 00:20:59.431
I did.

866
00:20:59.431 --> 00:21:01.030
And they didn't get involved in shark fights.

867
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.193
Yeah.

868
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.303
Somebody,

869
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.620
did they have something to do with like Sean fights as well?

870
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.370
I don't know.

871
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.500
So maybe this a few people involved.

872
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.430
It was a good car that I was on,

873
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.980
had a Georgie Parkdale.

874
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.900
They had uh,

875
00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:13.880
uh,

876
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.720
[inaudible] uh,

877
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:16.690
fuck.

878
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:17.810
What's the bunch of people and um,

879
00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.390
hmm.

880
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.680
So what was it like fighting high?

881
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.751
Well,

882
00:21:21.751 --> 00:21:22.770
for me at the time,

883
00:21:22.771 --> 00:21:24.990
that was my biggest event and I'm was fighting,

884
00:21:24.991 --> 00:21:25.550
uh,

885
00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.340
uh,

886
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.330
Karen Double Radians.

887
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.400
So it was the biggest name I had fought

888
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.321
to me.

889
00:21:31.321 --> 00:21:32.154
It was like,

890
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:33.300
fuck.

891
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:33.961
You know what I mean?

892
00:21:33.961 --> 00:21:35.940
I just was kinda overwhelmed.

893
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.340
I wasn't a Jujitsu.

894
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.420
I didn't know much about you just to actually,

895
00:21:39.421 --> 00:21:42.840
the whole fight was weird because on Monday I separated,

896
00:21:42.841 --> 00:21:44.760
my arm are separated my shoulder.

897
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.380
Wednesday they called me for the fight.

898
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:47.510
Saturday I fought.

899
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:48.250
Okay.

900
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.083
Separate years,

901
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:49.330
like,

902
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:50.320
I guess I'll get high for this.

903
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:51.030
Right.

904
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:51.600
You know what I mean?

905
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.021
Why you separate?

906
00:21:52.021 --> 00:21:53.080
Separated show like what,

907
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.820
like separation,

908
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:55.960
like a separated shoulder,

909
00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.150
like a torn myself.

910
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:57.380
No,

911
00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:57.491
no,

912
00:21:57.491 --> 00:21:57.571
no,

913
00:21:57.571 --> 00:21:57.631
no,

914
00:21:57.631 --> 00:21:58.010
no.

915
00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.843
Um,

916
00:21:59.050 --> 00:21:59.883
yeah,

917
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:00.611
up in the,

918
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:01.090
um,

919
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:02.610
I don't know what the fuck you asked me.

920
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.610
He love them.

921
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:03.910
Yeah,

922
00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:05.950
well we got it like bandaged up,

923
00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.000
got to work in,

924
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.833
fought with it.

925
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.360
He didn't fight,

926
00:22:10.361 --> 00:22:11.500
would've been bandaged up,

927
00:22:11.501 --> 00:22:14.110
but the next two days kinda held on it.

928
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.650
Ice.

929
00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.600
It worked on as much as I can.

930
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.940
Went out there.

931
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:18.111
Uh,

932
00:22:18.111 --> 00:22:20.880
it was in Texas fought and uh,

933
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:21.430
yeah,

934
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:22.240
I was just,

935
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.110
for me it was weird.

936
00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:23.640
Like I said,

937
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.540
go one decision.

938
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:26.703
Uh,

939
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.590
like I said at first round he got through a bunch of like Lego blocks.

940
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:30.321
Yeah.

941
00:22:30.321 --> 00:22:32.430
He's a serious spools his leg.

942
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:33.471
That's what I was saying.

943
00:22:33.471 --> 00:22:33.980
Like,

944
00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.100
hi [inaudible] don't know what's going on.

945
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.083
I

946
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.780
just want to get out of here.

947
00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.540
So it was,

948
00:22:41.541 --> 00:22:42.890
it was a bad thing for me.

949
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.370
So one and done first fight and high done.

950
00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:45.750
I was like,

951
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:46.110
yeah.

952
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.943
Cool.

953
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:47.481
Have you ever fought?

954
00:22:47.481 --> 00:22:48.314
Hi?

955
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.160
<v 5>Uh,</v>

956
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.770
I mean I'm sure I fought at spar high all the time.

957
00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:53.743
Uh,

958
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.400
uh,

959
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.233
hi.

960
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:57.900
What's your feeling about that?

961
00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.600
I think it like a,

962
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:01.380
for this Jujitsu tournament,

963
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:01.711
you know,

964
00:23:01.711 --> 00:23:03.780
Jujitsu is not my strong suit obviously.

965
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.621
And so for me,

966
00:23:04.621 --> 00:23:07.020
that was my first Jiu Jitsu tournament and uh,

967
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.770
we just put it on the g like about a month ago when Matt told me about that

968
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:11.371
things like,

969
00:23:11.371 --> 00:23:11.461
oh,

970
00:23:11.461 --> 00:23:12.061
I should do it.

971
00:23:12.061 --> 00:23:14.280
And Micky Gall I train with every day and uh,

972
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.470
him and Bomba and we like,

973
00:23:16.471 --> 00:23:16.681
all right,

974
00:23:16.681 --> 00:23:16.951
fuck it,

975
00:23:16.951 --> 00:23:17.311
we'll do it.

976
00:23:17.311 --> 00:23:18.900
So we start putting on the g and a,

977
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:19.850
yeah,

978
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:20.101
it was,

979
00:23:20.101 --> 00:23:20.520
um,

980
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.780
I didn't want to make a fool of myself.

981
00:23:21.781 --> 00:23:23.720
So being high and having that like pressure,

982
00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.050
like not being completely comfortable.

983
00:23:25.051 --> 00:23:25.801
I think it was different.

984
00:23:25.801 --> 00:23:29.970
But like in a kickboxing fight I could probably be drunk and still be pretty

985
00:23:29.971 --> 00:23:30.804
comfortable with.

986
00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:35.811
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

987
00:23:35.811 --> 00:23:37.010
This is a lot of people that think that,

988
00:23:37.011 --> 00:23:40.100
and I'm one of them that think that marijuana is a performance enhancing drug.

989
00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.410
I don't think so.

990
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:42.261
On a certain,

991
00:23:42.261 --> 00:23:43.094
on certain levels,

992
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:43.881
certain levels.

993
00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:44.990
I think you could fuck you up,

994
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.440
but,

995
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.273
but it's,

996
00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:47.630
<v 1>if you get the dose right,</v>

997
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.840
I think you puts you in a zone in our comfortable zone.

998
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.281
<v 5>Right.</v>

999
00:23:51.281 --> 00:23:51.840
And I think that the,

1000
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.380
a lot of mean for performance,

1001
00:23:53.381 --> 00:23:56.470
like how well it's going to increase your performance is not being super

1002
00:23:56.471 --> 00:23:58.250
stressed out over bullshit the weekend.

1003
00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.160
That's where I find the most benefit.

1004
00:24:00.161 --> 00:24:03.910
Like when I would quit smoking weed for a couple of days before the fight,

1005
00:24:03.911 --> 00:24:06.550
that was when it's like now's when I needed it the most and I was one the most

1006
00:24:06.551 --> 00:24:08.170
stressed out is when I have the most anxiety.

1007
00:24:08.171 --> 00:24:10.210
When I have the hungriest they can,

1008
00:24:10.211 --> 00:24:10.390
you know,

1009
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.631
I was like,

1010
00:24:10.631 --> 00:24:11.470
this sucks.

1011
00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.360
I can just play it and just relax.

1012
00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:14.643
I think that helps.

1013
00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.091
<v 1>Hey Man,</v>

1014
00:24:15.091 --> 00:24:17.730
are you doing any cryotherapy or anything to reduce swelling?

1015
00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:18.320
<v 0>A little,</v>

1016
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:18.791
like I said,

1017
00:24:18.791 --> 00:24:20.470
I was doing a little bit with uh,

1018
00:24:20.471 --> 00:24:20.891
the,

1019
00:24:20.891 --> 00:24:21.724
um,

1020
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.640
the,

1021
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.473
um,

1022
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.500
I'm trying to like the chiropractor that I was going to,

1023
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.030
but I haven't done much of it.

1024
00:24:28.031 --> 00:24:31.420
But that's one thing I would really want you to get into because of the swelling

1025
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.471
a lot.

1026
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:32.891
Like I said,

1027
00:24:32.891 --> 00:24:34.450
a lot of it's went down over the,

1028
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:35.171
over the time,

1029
00:24:35.171 --> 00:24:38.350

1052
00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:13.220

1054
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.110
A CBD company.

1055
00:25:15.111 --> 00:25:16.980
I've been working with the pen.

1056
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.170
Yeah,

1057
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.600
<v 5>like medicated drops.</v>

1058
00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:21.910
I get it gives you like a certain dose every time you click it.

1059
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.860
<v 1>Oh,</v>

1060
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.011
I've been using,

1061
00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:25.730
um,

1062
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:27.080
you ever heard of that company Jambo?

1063
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.320
They just sent me some CBD.

1064
00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:32.180
A Rub on Holy Shit.

1065
00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.020
Does that work for you?

1066
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:33.711
Fuck yeah.

1067
00:25:33.711 --> 00:25:34.730
2000 milligrams.

1068
00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:35.570
CBD Rub on.

1069
00:25:35.571 --> 00:25:39.620
I told you this sciatic pains been fucking with me or the last week or so and a,

1070
00:25:39.621 --> 00:25:43.850
I rub it on my hip like it's like my ass muscle and right over like right here.

1071
00:25:43.851 --> 00:25:44.710
That's where it like it,

1072
00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.580
it travels down and I rubbed that shit on before I go to bed.

1073
00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.950
<v 5>Cause Flavor has these uh,</v>

1074
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.840
they have like medicated patches you can use to have roll ons that you could use

1075
00:25:52.841 --> 00:25:54.160
it if it's solve stuff.

1076
00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.650
I just feel like I smoked so much weed with CBD and it all the time that it

1077
00:25:58.651 --> 00:25:58.900
don't,

1078
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.400
it doesn't seem to work for me.

1079
00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:01.511
I don't notice it.

1080
00:26:01.511 --> 00:26:01.900
You know.

1081
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.190
And then they have these droppers.

1082
00:26:03.191 --> 00:26:04.210
I use that like crazy.

1083
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:04.781
Yeah.

1084
00:26:04.781 --> 00:26:07.630
Maybe you just got too much of a tolerance.

1085
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:08.480
Well I just think if you,

1086
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:08.820
you know,

1087
00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.370
if you smoke weed constantly there's CBD and everything,

1088
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:12.521
you're hitting both.

1089
00:26:12.521 --> 00:26:16.450
So like when when my coach who's was like 65 and never smoked weed and I give

1090
00:26:16.451 --> 00:26:17.570
him put it that shit on him,

1091
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:17.831
he's like,

1092
00:26:17.831 --> 00:26:18.470
oh my God,

1093
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.520
my elbow feels correct me.

1094
00:26:20.521 --> 00:26:20.941
I'm just like,

1095
00:26:20.941 --> 00:26:21.700
Eh,

1096
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.050
<v 1>I'll get you some of that jumbo shit.</v>

1097
00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.610
It's better than anything I've ever used before.

1098
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:25.990
They have two versions.

1099
00:26:25.991 --> 00:26:29.610
They have a 300 milligram in 2000 milligram and I put that 2000 milligram arm

1100
00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.270
and it's got like a menthol in it.

1101
00:26:31.271 --> 00:26:33.460
So you feel it like when your skin like Ooh,

1102
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:34.560
heats up.

1103
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.910
<v 0>Tell him I really have a feeling that is like using it on my neck.</v>

1104
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:38.560
Yeah.

1105
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.290
Like using on my neck and I've used it on my hand to where I've liked the

1106
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:44.100
achiness does the achiness goes

1107
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:44.341
<v 3>away.</v>

1108
00:26:44.341 --> 00:26:45.420
But on my neck as well,

1109
00:26:45.421 --> 00:26:48.090
I felt it the most like up in the pain.

1110
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:53.270
But I put out this CBD vaporizers and then there's CBD bath bomb and he used

1111
00:26:53.781 --> 00:26:55.230
that before my buddy's fight.

1112
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.041
The day of the fight,

1113
00:26:56.041 --> 00:26:57.180
we dropped it in the uh,

1114
00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:58.923
and the hot tub

1115
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.560
CBD Balms some fucking monsters out there that trying to make this illegal.

1116
00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:05.251
It is crazy.

1117
00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:05.820
Oh my gosh.

1118
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.651
Pharmaceutical.

1119
00:27:06.651 --> 00:27:07.484
Those guys.

1120
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:08.690
Fuck those guys.

1121
00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.390
So scary that someone would do that.

1122
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.920
They would try to spend money to try to make this stuff illegal.

1123
00:27:13.921 --> 00:27:14.850
And then while they're doing that,

1124
00:27:14.851 --> 00:27:18.480
they legalize like the fucking GMO synthetic version,

1125
00:27:18.481 --> 00:27:19.850
which is like actually killing Zack.

1126
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:20.611
Seriously.

1127
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:20.941
Fuck.

1128
00:27:20.941 --> 00:27:22.380
Those people were fentanyl.

1129
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:23.280
That shit's killing.

1130
00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.710
Everybody killed Prince.

1131
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.820
It killed David.

1132
00:27:26.821 --> 00:27:28.530
Bowie had killed.

1133
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.311
Who the fuck else are?

1134
00:27:29.311 --> 00:27:30.061
They killed it.

1135
00:27:30.061 --> 00:27:31.620
Killed it.

1136
00:27:31.621 --> 00:27:33.300
Killed a bunch of people this year.

1137
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.750
Tom Petty Killed Tom Petty too.

1138
00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.021
Did he kill David?

1139
00:27:37.021 --> 00:27:39.330
Go or make that up so I'm killed.

1140
00:27:39.331 --> 00:27:40.164
David Bowie.

1141
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.840
Who knows what's the ball?

1142
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:44.020
What's that?

1143
00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:44.630
That's a,

1144
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.240
that's a CBD bath bomb.

1145
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:46.850
Dang.

1146
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:47.730
You just drop that in.

1147
00:27:47.731 --> 00:27:48.091
That's it.

1148
00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:50.130
That's fucking not fucking around.

1149
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.540
That's his legit,

1150
00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:53.920
they still good time.

1151
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:58.140
I really feel like a rub on effect from CBD is like I'll soak in one of those.

1152
00:27:58.141 --> 00:27:59.850
Just never did the bathroom.

1153
00:27:59.851 --> 00:28:00.120
Yeah,

1154
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:00.610
it's good.

1155
00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:01.443
Yeah.

1156
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.200
And it's fun to watch you dropped it in and I'll just August.

1157
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:08.733
I got a lot of shit in here.

1158
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:09.631
Write some stuff Joe.

1159
00:28:09.631 --> 00:28:10.080
Beautiful.

1160
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:10.891
I got some good little,

1161
00:28:10.891 --> 00:28:11.340
uh,

1162
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.140
you know,

1163
00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.880
to Chili's and edible.

1164
00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:15.363
Yeah.

1165
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.333
Ooh.

1166
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.100
Citing Max got it off.

1167
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.911
This is awesome.

1168
00:28:20.911 --> 00:28:22.830
I take this on my international flights.

1169
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.293
Allegedly.

1170
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.070
The key folks of law is illegal.

1171
00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:27.811
It's illegal,

1172
00:28:27.811 --> 00:28:28.530
but it's a,

1173
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.340
when you put the the vape pen and do it [inaudible] it looks like a car key

1174
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.250
security.

1175
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:39.120
Oh that's crazy.

1176
00:28:39.121 --> 00:28:40.230
I miss lot the bathroom.

1177
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:41.801
So you screw that.

1178
00:28:41.801 --> 00:28:45.570
Decide the caps on from given that he put it in there.

1179
00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.940
And these look at these candy.

1180
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:51.873
So jazz.

1181
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:56.310
So my complaint about the candy thing is if they're going to have like a,

1182
00:28:56.311 --> 00:28:57.144
um,

1183
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:58.830
that those are CBD,

1184
00:28:58.831 --> 00:29:02.100
but they have a THC wants to and if you're going to have THC,

1185
00:29:02.101 --> 00:29:03.480
like super potent candy,

1186
00:29:03.481 --> 00:29:05.850
they shouldn't taste so fucking good because I'll eat the whole bag.

1187
00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:06.990
You know what I mean?

1188
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.010
Like who's going to eat just one?

1189
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.053
That's very good.

1190
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.273
That's watermelon.

1191
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.830
Watermelon bags at once.

1192
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.320
Yeah.

1193
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.960
This is watermelon belts.

1194
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:18.863
It's like a belt.

1195
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.790
Super lucky dude.

1196
00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:21.990
Check your shit.

1197
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:23.370
This is the shit.

1198
00:29:23.371 --> 00:29:24.204
Look at this thing.

1199
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.800
I love it.

1200
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.320
And then I think it has like a,

1201
00:29:28.321 --> 00:29:29.490
there's three different settings.

1202
00:29:29.491 --> 00:29:31.620
Repeat or how you burn it.

1203
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.260
These kids today,

1204
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:34.651
oh,

1205
00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:35.730
you got to turn it off five times.

1206
00:29:35.731 --> 00:29:37.860
Click it fund on to the other side.

1207
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:38.251
One,

1208
00:29:38.251 --> 00:29:38.700
two,

1209
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.031
three,

1210
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:39.451
four,

1211
00:29:39.451 --> 00:29:40.284
five.

1212
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:49.203
<v 0>Nope.</v>

1213
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.550
<v 4>Can you maybe that's the heat up,</v>

1214
00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.120
getting more into Joe fucking it up their job that you got it.

1215
00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:57.210
You got it.

1216
00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:57.840
You got to go on.

1217
00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.770
Maybe it had to heat up.

1218
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:59.783
There it goes.

1219
00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:00.913
There it goes.

1220
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.033
Burn it.

1221
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:03.690
How was a ballad tours,

1222
00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:06.450
drug testing policy standard.

1223
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:09.070
We don't have like the additional,

1224
00:30:09.071 --> 00:30:09.900
uh,

1225
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.160
you saw the random tests,

1226
00:30:11.161 --> 00:30:14.190
but I get tested before or after every fight.

1227
00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:14.941
I haven't tested.

1228
00:30:14.941 --> 00:30:15.810
Most of them are boys.

1229
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.860
I know that.

1230
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.430
Yeah.

1231
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:18.263
So,

1232
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.100
and I've had people talk shit like,

1233
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:20.461
oh,

1234
00:30:20.461 --> 00:30:21.294
they won't tell us like,

1235
00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.080
well,

1236
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.210
I'll know what he's talking about the test after fights.

1237
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.850
But obviously there's a big difference between that and hey,

1238
00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:27.871
it's four weeks out,

1239
00:30:27.871 --> 00:30:29.250
wake up at six 30 in the morning.

1240
00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:29.791
What do you been up to,

1241
00:30:29.791 --> 00:30:31.100
Daniel here pissing his cup.

1242
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.531
Look at that.

1243
00:30:31.531 --> 00:30:32.031
It's Taro.

1244
00:30:32.031 --> 00:30:32.864
It's crazy.

1245
00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:33.831
I mean they,

1246
00:30:33.831 --> 00:30:36.960
they have lost a lot of people off the roster in the UFC.

1247
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.210
The really crazy thing is the body's changing.

1248
00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:39.950
Yeah.

1249
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:40.980
Like people you weren't sure,

1250
00:30:40.981 --> 00:30:41.221
you know,

1251
00:30:41.221 --> 00:30:41.371
you know,

1252
00:30:41.371 --> 00:30:44.160
everybody passed the test when they were doing it on the way in day,

1253
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.290
but then you're looking at their bodies changed like,

1254
00:30:46.291 --> 00:30:47.124
Whoa,

1255
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:47.980
this guy.

1256
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.090
So many of them just shriveled up and they just look totally different in their

1257
00:30:51.091 --> 00:30:52.290
performances are different.

1258
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:56.370
Their mindset's different guys that were just unstoppable and they saw that came

1259
00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.080
in sixth fight,

1260
00:30:58.081 --> 00:30:58.790
losing streak,

1261
00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:01.010
crazy drop two weight classes get away.

1262
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:02.820
Anybody who says it's steroids doesn't work.

1263
00:31:02.821 --> 00:31:04.110
It's crazy.

1264
00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:05.761
Fucking mine.

1265
00:31:05.761 --> 00:31:06.930
They're not taking it for fun.

1266
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:08.023
Right.

1267
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:09.180
You know,

1268
00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:12.300
they're not going all the way down to Tijuana and get by in this shit because

1269
00:31:12.301 --> 00:31:12.540
it's,

1270
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.180
it's fun to good to do on the weekend.

1271
00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.430
So do you feel like you got a new lease on life?

1272
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:19.583
<v 0>Um,</v>

1273
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.980
I do a man right now I'm just grinding,

1274
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.850
like fully focused on getting back into the cage.

1275
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:27.773
Like,

1276
00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:28.770
you know,

1277
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:29.603
having,

1278
00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:32.910
having what happened to me and being in a position that I'm in,

1279
00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.040
I don't really have too many things to go back to them.

1280
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:35.903
So,

1281
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:36.690
you know,

1282
00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:40.080
having a new lease on life really isn't how I would say it is.

1283
00:31:40.081 --> 00:31:42.090
It's just what it is.

1284
00:31:42.091 --> 00:31:44.640
I'm just focused on the next step,

1285
00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:45.301
you know what I mean?

1286
00:31:45.301 --> 00:31:46.550
The next step in my career,

1287
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:48.150
the next step and you know,

1288
00:31:48.151 --> 00:31:49.710
the path and what I've been going through,

1289
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.580
you know,

1290
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.960
it's always just something for me.

1291
00:31:51.961 --> 00:31:52.794
So,

1292
00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:53.220
you know,

1293
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.690
I wouldn't say it's a new lease of life,

1294
00:31:54.691 --> 00:31:56.280
but just a new chapter.

1295
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.230
<v 4>But you must feel very fortunate that you,</v>

1296
00:31:58.231 --> 00:31:59.450
you can recover from that.

1297
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:00.303
Do I do?

1298
00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:01.120
Um,

1299
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:01.960
it's amazing story.

1300
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.160
I love hearing shit.

1301
00:32:03.161 --> 00:32:03.530
Like

1302
00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:04.363
<v 0>I agree.</v>

1303
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:05.321
It's a,

1304
00:32:05.321 --> 00:32:06.370
it just sucks.

1305
00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.001
You know what I mean?

1306
00:32:07.001 --> 00:32:08.260
It sucks to be in this position,

1307
00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:08.680
but I'm,

1308
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:08.891
I'm,

1309
00:32:08.891 --> 00:32:09.401
I'm here,

1310
00:32:09.401 --> 00:32:10.270
I'm talking to you,

1311
00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:11.830
talking to this guy,

1312
00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.200
you know,

1313
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.033
walking around.

1314
00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.640
So I'm blessed more than anything,

1315
00:32:15.641 --> 00:32:20.641
but this is just fired me up to just get shit going on.

1316
00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.380
You know what I mean?

1317
00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.900
<v 4>So you got to feel pretty fucking unstoppable after that.</v>

1318
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:28.730
Go flying to check in before this shit and you come back like,

1319
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.650
what's going to stop?

1320
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:30.080
Yeah,

1321
00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:30.913
that's the goal.

1322
00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:32.360
<v 0>Get another belt,</v>

1323
00:32:32.361 --> 00:32:32.841
get back,

1324
00:32:32.841 --> 00:32:33.621
get another belt,

1325
00:32:33.621 --> 00:32:34.071
show people.

1326
00:32:34.071 --> 00:32:34.491
I'm not,

1327
00:32:34.491 --> 00:32:35.324
you know,

1328
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:36.643
not done at all.

1329
00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:37.581
You know,

1330
00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:38.414
so,

1331
00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.380
uh,

1332
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:39.770
yeah,

1333
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:40.850
I'm even still running.

1334
00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:43.780
<v 1>Are you really fucking savage?</v>

1335
00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.160
Jesus Christ.

1336
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.950
Just say one 76 the other day,

1337
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.201
dude,

1338
00:32:47.201 --> 00:32:48.610
I'd be an h one.

1339
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.320
The real one real hummer.

1340
00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:53.560
I'd be in one of those bitches and I'd ride in the middle of it.

1341
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:54.070
Right.

1342
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.791
I figured out a way to,

1343
00:32:54.791 --> 00:32:56.370
if we put the steering wheel in the middle,

1344
00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:02.230
but I don't want to be on either side and strapped me with a race harness and

1345
00:33:02.231 --> 00:33:03.910
put fucking airbags everywhere.

1346
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.880
I want this thing to be like an inflatable bath toy,

1347
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:08.303
but I'm an,

1348
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:08.860
I'm an

1349
00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:09.790
<v 0>adrenaline junkie,</v>

1350
00:33:09.791 --> 00:33:11.800
so I love to do anything,

1351
00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:12.740
you know,

1352
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.320
I shouldn't be riding obviously,

1353
00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:15.243
but uh,

1354
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:16.691
you know,

1355
00:33:16.691 --> 00:33:18.310
I need something to study my mind.

1356
00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.450
So like I said,

1357
00:33:19.451 --> 00:33:19.790
training,

1358
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:21.070
training has been going,

1359
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.260
something I got back into riding,

1360
00:33:23.261 --> 00:33:27.250
something I got back into and it's pushing me to like move forward.

1361
00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:27.711
Would it be,

1362
00:33:27.711 --> 00:33:29.260
how long was it before you wrote again?

1363
00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:31.900
I probably started riding again

1364
00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:35.770
maybe about a month and a half.

1365
00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.050
<v 1>What about a month ago?</v>

1366
00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.200
About a month ago.

1367
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:38.761
A month ago.

1368
00:33:38.761 --> 00:33:39.080
Okay.

1369
00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:39.760
Not a month then.

1370
00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.350
So five months after the injury at probably about a month.

1371
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.660
If you did a month after Andrea,

1372
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:45.500
like this dude is fucking crazy.

1373
00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:46.360
Get barely walk.

1374
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.411
That's some shit.

1375
00:33:49.411 --> 00:33:50.244
I would try them.

1376
00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.500
I mean I would definitely try it.

1377
00:33:51.501 --> 00:33:53.730
But what do you think makes you such an adrenaline junkie?

1378
00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:54.751
I don't know.

1379
00:33:54.751 --> 00:33:56.070
Even right before all my fights

1380
00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:56.913
<v 0>it's like,</v>

1381
00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.900
it's just been that way.

1382
00:33:58.901 --> 00:34:03.430
Like I would always ride a lot before my fights because I had to release,

1383
00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:03.880
you know,

1384
00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.713
all the adrenaline,

1385
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:04.841
the,

1386
00:34:04.841 --> 00:34:06.910
all the pent up like anxiety,

1387
00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:09.430
anxiety going on and that's just how I've always been,

1388
00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:09.760
you know?

1389
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.410
I've always wanted to see what was it like to kill yourself,

1390
00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:14.980
you know?

1391
00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.090
What was it like to foot back,

1392
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.491
<v 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1393
00:34:19.491 --> 00:34:20.630
Like adrenaline wise,

1394
00:34:20.631 --> 00:34:23.070
what was it like to do something fun and exciting?

1395
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.133
Push the limit,

1396
00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.191
you know what I mean?

1397
00:34:25.191 --> 00:34:25.490
Yeah.

1398
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:27.910
That sounds very different than I didn't mean it like that.

1399
00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.520
I mean Diego corrals,

1400
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:31.820
he died in a motorcycle accident.

1401
00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:32.540
Right?

1402
00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:33.321
Paul Williams,

1403
00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:33.621
you know,

1404
00:34:33.621 --> 00:34:34.454
he got fucked up.

1405
00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.600
There's so many fighters that have gotten into motorcycles for that.

1406
00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:39.653
<v 0>The reason,</v>

1407
00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.190
but it's not just motorcycles.

1408
00:34:41.191 --> 00:34:43.680
I mean I've done until all type of shit.

1409
00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:44.603
Like what else?

1410
00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:46.860
I mean dive and I love diving.

1411
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.810
Water is one of my favorite things.

1412
00:34:48.811 --> 00:34:50.460
The ocean is one of my favorite things to do.

1413
00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:51.151
You know,

1414
00:34:51.151 --> 00:34:54.450
I've never been in any situation where I'm about to die or anything,

1415
00:34:54.451 --> 00:34:55.400
but you know,

1416
00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.990
I want to do sky diving.

1417
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.590
I want to do rock climb.

1418
00:34:58.591 --> 00:34:59.424
I don't want to do all this.

1419
00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:00.220
<v 3>Me,</v>

1420
00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.870
Cho Shaylin's on my page.

1421
00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:03.760
He and Joe are on the same page,

1422
00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:05.163
all that.

1423
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:09.180
I don't even like roller coasters to drag me on it the first time.

1424
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.611
Then I'm like,

1425
00:35:09.611 --> 00:35:10.444
we're going again.

1426
00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.501
Until that point I'm like,

1427
00:35:11.501 --> 00:35:11.831
no,

1428
00:35:11.831 --> 00:35:12.664
fuck that.

1429
00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:15.280
You ride bikes a little bit,

1430
00:35:15.281 --> 00:35:18.730
but I don't like when I go down to the ranch with Coldwell riding with them,

1431
00:35:18.731 --> 00:35:22.540
but they make fun of me cause I'll go like 60 once I get paid like 60 then it

1432
00:35:22.541 --> 00:35:23.321
starts getting my God,

1433
00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:24.010
I don't know,

1434
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.610
just be cool cowboy example.

1435
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:31.510
Hellboy will be fucking going down the highway 90 with his hat off,

1436
00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.920
like resize and his hat,

1437
00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:33.620
you know?

1438
00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.290
No hands 90 down the highway.

1439
00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:36.850
He's fucking not yeah.

1440
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.370
Or snapping pictures

1441
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.660
<v 5>of us while he's riding.</v>

1442
00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.140
Oh,

1443
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:40.681
Jesus.

1444
00:35:40.681 --> 00:35:41.514
I don't want to hear it.

1445
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.170
Isn't that for sure?

1446
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.100
I love that dude.

1447
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.420
I don't want him to get hurt.

1448
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:46.283
I don't want to hear that.

1449
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.153
Yeah,

1450
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:47.840
fuck.

1451
00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.480
He's good at it,

1452
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:48.960
I guess.

1453
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.321
Oh yeah.

1454
00:35:49.321 --> 00:35:50.720
I'm sure he is good at fighting too,

1455
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:51.410
but

1456
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:52.490
<v 1>it's fucking dangerous.</v>

1457
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:54.680
Just like you should dot your I's.

1458
00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.720
Cross your t's or sure.

1459
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:57.770
90 on the highway.

1460
00:35:57.771 --> 00:35:58.604
Fuck that.

1461
00:35:59.570 --> 00:35:59.811
Yeah.

1462
00:35:59.811 --> 00:36:02.900
He's a perfect example of a legit adrenaline junkie.

1463
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:03.743
Hundred percent.

1464
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:05.840
A hundred percent,

1465
00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:06.290
hundred percent.

1466
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.090
I guess just some people once,

1467
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:10.610
I guess fighting is a big part of it.

1468
00:36:10.611 --> 00:36:13.190
Like once you've experienced the highs of fighting,

1469
00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:16.760
I guess the lows of regular life or just too fucking boring.

1470
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:17.480
Is that what it is,

1471
00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:17.721
<v 5>man?</v>

1472
00:36:17.721 --> 00:36:18.554
Imagine that.

1473
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:19.670
I feel like you would get,

1474
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.800
I would definitely mammoth thought about retiring,

1475
00:36:21.801 --> 00:36:23.300
but when I stopped fighting,

1476
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:25.760
I think that's what really bothered me

1477
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:30.290
because I'm addicted to like not the adrenaline side of,

1478
00:36:30.291 --> 00:36:31.250
they'd be like the challenge,

1479
00:36:31.251 --> 00:36:32.084
like the,

1480
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:35.330
you can't do this like me versus the world like that.

1481
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.590
That really gets me going.

1482
00:36:36.591 --> 00:36:39.210
But I think if I didn't have that when I'm old,

1483
00:36:39.211 --> 00:36:40.250
I'd be pretty pissed off.

1484
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:41.570
You'll versus the world.

1485
00:36:41.571 --> 00:36:42.404
Like how so?

1486
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:43.280
Uh,

1487
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.000
like,

1488
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.610
or like even just me versus like me man versus man,

1489
00:36:46.611 --> 00:36:47.770
like one on one like that,

1490
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:48.531
no other,

1491
00:36:48.531 --> 00:36:50.360
it's just you're the only one that you can,

1492
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.841
you,

1493
00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:51.230
uh,

1494
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.861
can count on.

1495
00:36:51.861 --> 00:36:52.940
And that scenario I guess.

1496
00:36:52.941 --> 00:36:53.720
But like that,

1497
00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.690
that personal challenge is what drives me and fuels me.

1498
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:57.521
And that's what,

1499
00:36:57.521 --> 00:36:58.510
why like I think,

1500
00:36:58.650 --> 00:36:59.090
uh,

1501
00:36:59.090 --> 00:36:59.923
my career,

1502
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:00.860
the,

1503
00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.480
the fights that I wasn't supposed to win,

1504
00:37:02.481 --> 00:37:05.150
we're always the ones that I really showed up for it because that Jen,

1505
00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.013
that,

1506
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:07.520
that hit me where it was,

1507
00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:09.440
if I was supposed to,

1508
00:37:09.441 --> 00:37:12.260
when everyone thought I was going to win for some on some level,

1509
00:37:12.261 --> 00:37:14.450
I would not show up the same way.

1510
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:15.343
Very common.

1511
00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:16.190
That's very common.

1512
00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:17.541
A lot of guys,

1513
00:37:17.541 --> 00:37:19.130
when when they think it's going to be an easy fight,

1514
00:37:19.131 --> 00:37:19.964
they can't get up.

1515
00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:21.200
They just have this weird,

1516
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:22.820
and it's weird because like you don't,

1517
00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:23.571
you know,

1518
00:37:23.571 --> 00:37:25.730
your coaches won't let you not train the way.

1519
00:37:25.731 --> 00:37:27.290
Like you train hard for the fight,

1520
00:37:27.291 --> 00:37:27.540
you know,

1521
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:32.150
it was just something about the thing in your head doesn't click or it doesn't,

1522
00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:32.780
you know,

1523
00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.040
go after it the same way.

1524
00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:35.881
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1525
00:37:35.881 --> 00:37:39.480
It's like the thing that everybody hates the most about before a fight,

1526
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.670
that discomfort and anxiety and just fuck,

1527
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:42.511
why am I doing this?

1528
00:37:42.511 --> 00:37:45.330
Fuck that is what is your friend when you're in there?

1529
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:45.790
Yeah,

1530
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:46.623
yeah,

1531
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:47.021
yeah.

1532
00:37:47.021 --> 00:37:47.854
It's the fights.

1533
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:48.071
<v 5>Good.</v>

1534
00:37:48.071 --> 00:37:48.904
To an extent.

1535
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:50.880
That's what fucking drowns yet at the same time,

1536
00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.010
cause it'd be right people like fucking,

1537
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:56.460
their whole camp is perfect and as soon as they walk out in front of that crowd,

1538
00:37:56.461 --> 00:37:58.190
it's like the coaches like who the fuck is this?

1539
00:37:58.350 --> 00:37:59.340
What the fuck's going on?

1540
00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.140
But don't you think

1541
00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:00.810
<v 1>dabble sometimes.</v>

1542
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.360
But that's always that kind of person.

1543
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.871
Like a guy.

1544
00:38:03.871 --> 00:38:05.220
Like you doesn't have that.

1545
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:06.330
There's not,

1546
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:08.520
that's not a thing that you experience.

1547
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:09.271
You know?

1548
00:38:09.271 --> 00:38:13.560
I mean there's the type of people that crumble or usually like the guys who were

1549
00:38:13.561 --> 00:38:16.500
just murderers in the gym and then for whatever reason,

1550
00:38:16.501 --> 00:38:17.490
under the bright lights,

1551
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:18.180
they falter,

1552
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.280
but they rarely rise.

1553
00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:24.030
Like those guys rarely when the big fights that they're not supposed to win,

1554
00:38:24.031 --> 00:38:24.520
that's not the,

1555
00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.370
not the same psychological makeup.

1556
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:31.020
Like something about the challenge or the unknown to some people,

1557
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:31.650
it,

1558
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.820
it just overwhelms them.

1559
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:34.050
Whereas other people,

1560
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.980
whatever their psychological makeup is,

1561
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.810
<v 3>that challenge is what fires them up.</v>

1562
00:38:37.811 --> 00:38:38.710
It gets him excited.

1563
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.610
Yeah.

1564
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:40.443
Yeah.

1565
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.261
It's weird,

1566
00:38:41.261 --> 00:38:41.940
right?

1567
00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:45.650
NC is the hard for longevity for the fighters in general and the curriculum.

1568
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:50.890
That's what makes Floyd Mayweather so impressive to me is for him to be at the

1569
00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:55.690
top of the game for so long and can make all the money and continue to be at the

1570
00:38:55.691 --> 00:38:56.860
top of the game and still do that.

1571
00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:57.903
I mean,

1572
00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:58.890
versus like a,

1573
00:38:59.410 --> 00:38:59.621
you know,

1574
00:38:59.621 --> 00:38:59.920
the,

1575
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.600
the guys that blow up and then,

1576
00:39:01.601 --> 00:39:02.320
you know,

1577
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.280
Jon Jones has trouble,

1578
00:39:03.281 --> 00:39:04.510
they don't know how to deal with the fame,

1579
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.541
who call on air,

1580
00:39:05.541 --> 00:39:07.060
throwing shit through bus windows.

1581
00:39:07.061 --> 00:39:09.810
Like it's hard to stay balanced and consistent through that whole,

1582
00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.990
I think from that whole thing,

1583
00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:11.820
<v 0>uh,</v>

1584
00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.830
my biggest one of my biggest thing has been,

1585
00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:14.221
you know,

1586
00:39:14.221 --> 00:39:15.900
the mental part of fighting,

1587
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.301
you know,

1588
00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:17.190
getting to the top,

1589
00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.390
being pushed back down,

1590
00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:19.260
getting to the top,

1591
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:20.341
you know,

1592
00:39:20.341 --> 00:39:24.960
just dealing with that as a fighter has put a lot of stress on like,

1593
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.740
you know,

1594
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.390
every time that I got into the cage,

1595
00:39:27.391 --> 00:39:30.540
like how I thought or how I acted or how it performing.

1596
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:31.463
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1597
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:32.010
So you,

1598
00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:33.420
you did some work with Vinny shoreman,

1599
00:39:33.421 --> 00:39:33.750
right?

1600
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:34.260
Yup.

1601
00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.093
How did that help?

1602
00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:35.740
<v 5>Uh,</v>

1603
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.620
Vinnie helped me a lot for,

1604
00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:38.120
uh,

1605
00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.900
I worked with any for I think three years,

1606
00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.310
two or three years.

1607
00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:42.300
And I find that,

1608
00:39:42.301 --> 00:39:43.080
um,

1609
00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:43.681
<v 3>tell everybody,</v>

1610
00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:46.560
Vinny chairmen's a hypnotist whose been on the show a couple times.

1611
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:48.760
I was the one that had told you about the aunts,

1612
00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:49.620
brought him up on the phone.

1613
00:39:49.621 --> 00:39:50.100
Shit,

1614
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:50.933
someone wants credit.

1615
00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:53.030
I made you Benny.

1616
00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:56.190
He has me.

1617
00:39:56.191 --> 00:39:56.870
It was a trip.

1618
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:57.270
Right.

1619
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.601
Wow.

1620
00:39:57.601 --> 00:39:58.434
This is real.

1621
00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.160
It really works

1622
00:39:59.160 --> 00:39:59.611
<v 5>for me.</v>

1623
00:39:59.611 --> 00:40:00.031
And then,

1624
00:40:00.031 --> 00:40:00.270
uh,

1625
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:02.370
I find that as I've grown,

1626
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:02.731
I think,

1627
00:40:02.731 --> 00:40:03.000
uh,

1628
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.230
just like any technique,

1629
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:05.020
you,

1630
00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.520
you get better at it and has it needs time till they kind of resonate inside of

1631
00:40:08.521 --> 00:40:08.611
you.

1632
00:40:08.611 --> 00:40:09.421
And I feel,

1633
00:40:09.421 --> 00:40:09.601
I mean,

1634
00:40:09.601 --> 00:40:11.530
I haven't worked with them in over a year and a,

1635
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.280
I still am figuring out,

1636
00:40:14.281 --> 00:40:15.960
we call that was the fuck he was talking about it.

1637
00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:17.580
I like this is leading starts to sink in.

1638
00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.110
So I think it's been a,

1639
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.580
the mental game is a huge,

1640
00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.081
a huge,

1641
00:40:22.081 --> 00:40:22.890
uh,

1642
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:23.690
asset.

1643
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:26.780
<v 3>Do you ever work with a sports psychologist or a hypnotist or anything like</v>

1644
00:40:26.781 --> 00:40:27.350
that?

1645
00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:27.651
<v 0>I mean,</v>

1646
00:40:27.651 --> 00:40:30.260
I've worked a little bit what a guy named will back in Florida.

1647
00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:31.430
This is some years ago,

1648
00:40:31.431 --> 00:40:33.850
but something I've always wanted to dabble in.

1649
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:35.120
It's something I've wanted to explore.

1650
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:37.490
I haven't really got the chance to do a lot of things,

1651
00:40:37.491 --> 00:40:39.410
but that's one thing I've always,

1652
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.981
like I said,

1653
00:40:39.981 --> 00:40:42.560
the mental part is been key to me,

1654
00:40:42.561 --> 00:40:44.690
so I always wanted to do that.

1655
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:47.750
<v 3>It might be a good thing to help you during your recovery too.</v>

1656
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.451
You know,

1657
00:40:48.451 --> 00:40:52.350
like to just really concentrate on recovery and really concentrated on the parts

1658
00:40:52.351 --> 00:40:53.710
of your body that need to be fixed.

1659
00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.673
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1660
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.331
I mean,

1661
00:40:55.331 --> 00:40:55.421
I'm,

1662
00:40:55.421 --> 00:40:56.180
but uh,

1663
00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:56.630
you know,

1664
00:40:56.630 --> 00:41:00.800
really need to reach out to the right people to get the right,

1665
00:41:00.801 --> 00:41:01.270
you know,

1666
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:02.103
um,

1667
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:04.070
the help as far as like,

1668
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:04.971
you know,

1669
00:41:04.971 --> 00:41:07.730
people to talk to him as far as having tests and stuff like that.

1670
00:41:07.731 --> 00:41:09.140
I don't really know anybody like that.

1671
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:10.650
<v 3>Vinny shoreman to the rescue.</v>

1672
00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:12.040
Yeah.

1673
00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.170
Well I'll let you,

1674
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.530
yeah,

1675
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:13.731
he'll,

1676
00:41:13.731 --> 00:41:14.564
he's probably listening.

1677
00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.320
He'll do it a over Skype too.

1678
00:41:16.321 --> 00:41:17.310
You do it over a,

1679
00:41:17.311 --> 00:41:17.641
you know,

1680
00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:19.830
you do a fucking facetime and he used to,

1681
00:41:19.831 --> 00:41:20.664
uh,

1682
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.810
used to hypnotize me over facetime all the time and then get on fight day.

1683
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:26.520
He would call me and like we'd be backstage,

1684
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:31.920
he'll be back in the states in October.

1685
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:32.580
Yeah.

1686
00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:32.960
Yeah.

1687
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.190
Okay.

1688
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.023
So

1689
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.940
<v 0>I'll look it up.</v>

1690
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:35.840
I'll make the connection.

1691
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.780
I would definitely look into what would definitely like,

1692
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.420
<v 5>but you've been using the lion's mane mushrooms too,</v>

1693
00:41:41.421 --> 00:41:42.254
right?

1694
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.280
I saw on there,

1695
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:48.680
I sent him that video and started talking to him about it when I found out about

1696
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:49.723
what happened to him.

1697
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.780
You know,

1698
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:51.613
it was like,

1699
00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.900
I'm sure not as bad as what he was going through,

1700
00:41:53.901 --> 00:41:54.600
but like we just,

1701
00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:54.750
Oh,

1702
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.180
I don't think he's going to walk again.

1703
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:56.530
Oh,

1704
00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:56.880
it's empty.

1705
00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.160
And it was in a horrible accident.

1706
00:41:58.161 --> 00:41:59.270
And then every time I talked to him,

1707
00:41:59.271 --> 00:42:00.950
he would just be like real like,

1708
00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:01.191
Nah,

1709
00:42:01.191 --> 00:42:01.730
fuck them.

1710
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:02.440
It's going to happen.

1711
00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.170
It's fucked that.

1712
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:04.003
And uh,

1713
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:04.671
I'm like,

1714
00:42:04.671 --> 00:42:04.851
all right,

1715
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:06.440
you need to take this lion's mane mushroom.

1716
00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:06.651
He needs,

1717
00:42:06.651 --> 00:42:07.610
some of these court is set much.

1718
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:07.771
Sure.

1719
00:42:07.771 --> 00:42:12.480
It was take all the flavor x CBD that you can get you some other mushrooms as

1720
00:42:12.481 --> 00:42:13.280
good for your brain,

1721
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.113
you'll be cool.

1722
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.100
And uh,

1723
00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.780
<v 0>I mean look at it and look what I did.</v>

1724
00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:18.520
Look what I did.

1725
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:19.320
Oh Joe.

1726
00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.160
Oh Joe Doing,

1727
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:20.450
<v 1>oh,</v>

1728
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.660
seeing you walking around and hearing that you're sparring and hitting the bag

1729
00:42:23.661 --> 00:42:24.680
and made the pads.

1730
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:25.061
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1731
00:42:25.061 --> 00:42:26.590
I mean all these things put together.

1732
00:42:26.591 --> 00:42:28.180
It's just what's given me back,

1733
00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:28.780
you know?

1734
00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.660
So it's nothing's impossible.

1735
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:32.440
I mean,

1736
00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:36.280
I can prove that nothing's impossible and shit,

1737
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:37.060
you know,

1738
00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:37.481
during them,

1739
00:42:37.481 --> 00:42:38.021
like you said,

1740
00:42:38.021 --> 00:42:42.060
even the lion's mane and the different CBDS I've been taking and the,

1741
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.310
just getting my body back to like feeling good,

1742
00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:46.510
mentally feeling good,

1743
00:42:46.511 --> 00:42:49.480
just everything's working like in steps.

1744
00:42:49.481 --> 00:42:51.100
So little steps at a time.

1745
00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:52.720
Basically day by day,

1746
00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:58.060
80% now I'll give you 75 75 is good,

1747
00:42:58.090 --> 00:42:58.540
you know,

1748
00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.200
75 minutes you can get to a hundred you know,

1749
00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.110
like I'm running,

1750
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:03.063
you know what I'm saying?

1751
00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:06.760
That wasn't one of my big goals was like buy in six months,

1752
00:43:06.761 --> 00:43:07.600
I want to be running,

1753
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.740
set a goal,

1754
00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:09.461
started running,

1755
00:43:09.461 --> 00:43:10.020
boom.

1756
00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.230
I'm a guy who couldn't walk.

1757
00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.071
Exactly.

1758
00:43:12.071 --> 00:43:14.320
So that's awesome.

1759
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:14.830
Yeah.

1760
00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:15.663
It's,

1761
00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.713
it's,

1762
00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:17.650
it's,

1763
00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:18.101
I don't know,

1764
00:43:18.101 --> 00:43:19.210
it gives me an uh,

1765
00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.440
every time I think about it,

1766
00:43:20.441 --> 00:43:23.170
the reason why I stopped cause cause every time I have to talk about it,

1767
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:27.520
I get in the mental thought of it in the process of from going,

1768
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.990
laying in the bed,

1769
00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.260
not be able to feel shit to,

1770
00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:33.190
you know,

1771
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:37.510
dragging your foot after you're walking with a walker to being able to pull up

1772
00:43:37.511 --> 00:43:39.370
your pants now it's crazy.

1773
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.320
It is fucking crazy.

1774
00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:42.011
You know what I mean?

1775
00:43:42.011 --> 00:43:42.601
And it just,

1776
00:43:42.601 --> 00:43:43.434
it keeps me,

1777
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:49.710
it keeps me humble enough to just talk about the situations and love it.

1778
00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.393
Love Life.

1779
00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:53.550
<v 1>That's a beautiful story man.</v>

1780
00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:54.990
I love hearing things like that.

1781
00:43:54.991 --> 00:43:57.240
People recovering from things because it's just,

1782
00:43:57.241 --> 00:44:02.241
it makes you appreciate the fact that you are all healthy every time anything

1783
00:44:02.431 --> 00:44:03.600
goes wrong and your live,

1784
00:44:03.601 --> 00:44:07.620
it's an opportunity to appreciate what it's like when things go right.

1785
00:44:07.621 --> 00:44:09.000
And if you can get back to where you were,

1786
00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.410
you'll have a new perspective.

1787
00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:11.550
I do for sure.

1788
00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:12.810
For sure.

1789
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:14.670
Are you fucking with that lion's mane stuff too?

1790
00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:15.873
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1791
00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:16.763
How often you take it?

1792
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:18.730
I was taking it every day.

1793
00:44:18.731 --> 00:44:19.930
I made a bunch of capsules,

1794
00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:20.920
uh,

1795
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.010
with lion's mane and a quarter subs.

1796
00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:24.160
You made the capsules yourself?

1797
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:24.720
Yeah,

1798
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:24.990
you can,

1799
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:28.240
you can buy it on Amazon little capsule machine.

1800
00:44:28.241 --> 00:44:29.170
They got a hundred capsules,

1801
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:32.340
a little concoction there.

1802
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:33.260
Nice.

1803
00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:34.093
Okay.

1804
00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:35.840
So when I saw on your,

1805
00:44:35.841 --> 00:44:37.160
your show a post,

1806
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.670
the Stamets was talking about how the,

1807
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:40.950
I think it was CTE,

1808
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:42.300
you guys were talking about how the,

1809
00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:43.590
the lion's Mane helps,

1810
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:44.424
uh,

1811
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.181
find,

1812
00:44:45.181 --> 00:44:45.650
no,

1813
00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:48.210
I don't know if a repairs it or if it just helps like the,

1814
00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:53.430
it find a way around blockages or whatever with neural tissue or tissue.

1815
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:54.270
And I was like,

1816
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:54.600
oh,

1817
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:54.991
Daniel,

1818
00:44:54.991 --> 00:44:56.280
like hit hit him up with it right

1819
00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:59.150
<v 1>now that lion's mane stuff is miraculous.</v>

1820
00:44:59.151 --> 00:44:59.984
I mean there's,

1821
00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:03.440
it's amazing that more people don't know about it and that more people aren't

1822
00:45:03.441 --> 00:45:04.131
talking about it,

1823
00:45:04.131 --> 00:45:06.380
but anybody that's involved in contact sports,

1824
00:45:06.381 --> 00:45:07.280
any athlete that,

1825
00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:07.491
you know,

1826
00:45:07.491 --> 00:45:10.550
it's getting hit and they're getting their cage rattled a lot.

1827
00:45:10.551 --> 00:45:12.350
They should be taking that stuff all the time.

1828
00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:13.430
Yeah.

1829
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:14.630
And CBD as well,

1830
00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:15.290
right?

1831
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.621
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1832
00:45:15.621 --> 00:45:16.041
for sure.

1833
00:45:16.041 --> 00:45:16.251
I mean,

1834
00:45:16.251 --> 00:45:17.260
I just look at it like a,

1835
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:19.400
the business that we're in is really dangerous and like,

1836
00:45:19.401 --> 00:45:22.760
if you know that there's something that,

1837
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.371
you know,

1838
00:45:23.371 --> 00:45:24.140
uh,

1839
00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:24.471
guys,

1840
00:45:24.471 --> 00:45:25.281
we get punchy,

1841
00:45:25.281 --> 00:45:25.551
right?

1842
00:45:25.551 --> 00:45:27.830
Or guys love lose their Chin or,

1843
00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.113
uh,

1844
00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:30.200
uh,

1845
00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.810
have problems like performing on fight night or whatever.

1846
00:45:32.811 --> 00:45:33.644
Like if you can,

1847
00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.870
if you could take CBD to be better for swelling,

1848
00:45:35.871 --> 00:45:37.910
you can take lion's mane of repair,

1849
00:45:37.911 --> 00:45:39.950
the concussions and shit that we're getting constantly.

1850
00:45:39.951 --> 00:45:43.550
Like I just think you're kind of stupid if you're not actively trying to figure

1851
00:45:43.551 --> 00:45:45.170
out a solution to all these problems.

1852
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:46.460
Have you ever fucked with Kratom?

1853
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:47.560
I never,

1854
00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.380
I not really.

1855
00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.430
I know people that have,

1856
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:50.061
I was,

1857
00:45:50.061 --> 00:45:50.600
um,

1858
00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.270
I was hanging out with Simon rex yesterday and he was telling me like some

1859
00:45:53.271 --> 00:45:57.320
awesome stories about people that were addicted to opiates.

1860
00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:59.120
They got off of it with Kratom.

1861
00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:00.300
I think it's all time erect,

1862
00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:01.340
Aka dirt nasty.

1863
00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:02.310
So good.

1864
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:03.051
That's so funny,

1865
00:46:03.051 --> 00:46:03.500
dude.

1866
00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.430
That's an awesome dude.

1867
00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:05.750
<v 1>I,</v>

1868
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:06.230
uh,

1869
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.063
I took eight,

1870
00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:08.570
eight pills yesterday,

1871
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.321
which,

1872
00:46:09.321 --> 00:46:09.500
uh,

1873
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:13.100
most of the time I was taking two and then I took four and then yesterday I took

1874
00:46:13.101 --> 00:46:13.850
eight.

1875
00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:15.200
Nah.

1876
00:46:15.201 --> 00:46:15.390
Oh,

1877
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:16.223
I get it.

1878
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.350
That stuff makes you high as fuck.

1879
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:19.940
When you take eight.

1880
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.100
My whole body felt weird.

1881
00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:22.560
I was,

1882
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.170
I was like pretending to be sober.

1883
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:25.970
I was walking around and pretend to be sober,

1884
00:46:25.971 --> 00:46:28.220
but not like a drunk,

1885
00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:28.790
not,

1886
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:30.230
not like reaction time.

1887
00:46:30.231 --> 00:46:30.401
Like,

1888
00:46:30.401 --> 00:46:30.501
you know,

1889
00:46:30.501 --> 00:46:33.020
like I almost knocked something off the counter or caught it real quick.

1890
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:34.460
It's like everything's normal.

1891
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:35.630
Like you body moves good,

1892
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:36.411
but a,

1893
00:46:36.411 --> 00:46:36.830
you're like,

1894
00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:37.970
Ooh,

1895
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:38.870
you feel weird.

1896
00:46:38.871 --> 00:46:39.350
You feel like,

1897
00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:40.300
Ooh,

1898
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:41.980
you're under the physically,

1899
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.210
mentally it's a very nice,

1900
00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:44.781
it's like,

1901
00:46:44.781 --> 00:46:44.961
yeah,

1902
00:46:44.961 --> 00:46:45.800
it gives you a body buzz,

1903
00:46:45.801 --> 00:46:46.634
but it's uh,

1904
00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:49.340
it's great at alleviating anxiety.

1905
00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:50.221
I'm going to,

1906
00:46:50.221 --> 00:46:51.380
it makes you really chill.

1907
00:46:51.381 --> 00:46:51.950
It's weird.

1908
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:54.830
It's just like puts you in this nice headspace where you're just like,

1909
00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:55.350
ah,

1910
00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:56.450
like everything's calm.

1911
00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:01.040
And I think the idea is that it fills up these opium receptors.

1912
00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:01.701
And that's what,

1913
00:47:01.701 --> 00:47:02.360
uh,

1914
00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.150
what people that have had real problems with opiates,

1915
00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.380
that's why they like it.

1916
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:08.810
Because even if you are fucked up on it,

1917
00:47:08.811 --> 00:47:09.650
you're not fucked up.

1918
00:47:09.651 --> 00:47:11.900
Like you're fucked up.

1919
00:47:11.901 --> 00:47:12.111
Like,

1920
00:47:12.111 --> 00:47:12.351
Woo,

1921
00:47:12.351 --> 00:47:13.131
I feel something.

1922
00:47:13.131 --> 00:47:13.711
So I'm crazy.

1923
00:47:13.711 --> 00:47:14.540
He's going on.

1924
00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:14.781
And I,

1925
00:47:14.781 --> 00:47:16.520
I was taking eight and uh,

1926
00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:18.320
my buddy Chris Bell,

1927
00:47:18.321 --> 00:47:19.940
he's the guy who directed that a bigger,

1928
00:47:19.941 --> 00:47:20.271
stronger,

1929
00:47:20.271 --> 00:47:21.230
faster documentary.

1930
00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.930
He had a real problem with opiates.

1931
00:47:23.931 --> 00:47:25.730
He got to a pretty serious,

1932
00:47:25.731 --> 00:47:26.540
a hip injury,

1933
00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:31.300
how to get hip replacement surgery and was in massive pain when he has a serious

1934
00:47:31.301 --> 00:47:33.790
arthritis like genetic arthritis.

1935
00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:36.880
And when he got his hip replaced and got on pain pills,

1936
00:47:36.881 --> 00:47:41.200
he got hooked bad in the middle of making a documentary about prescription

1937
00:47:41.201 --> 00:47:42.034
trucks,

1938
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:42.941
which is crazy.

1939
00:47:42.941 --> 00:47:43.661
In the middle of it,

1940
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:44.860
he got hooked himself,

1941
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.930
just total random,

1942
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:47.331
you know,

1943
00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:49.630
it was synchronicity and he takes 10,

1944
00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:51.190
he takes 10 of those.

1945
00:47:51.191 --> 00:47:52.780
So he takes two more than I took.

1946
00:47:52.781 --> 00:47:54.370
And I yesterday for like four hours,

1947
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:55.330
I was walking around like this.

1948
00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.870
<v 5>Ooh.</v>

1949
00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.780
But there's no real like side effects in comparison to the other stuff.

1950
00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:00.100
No,

1951
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.010
no real side effects.

1952
00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:04.700
After that last man standing tournament with Gloria had three fights in one

1953
00:48:04.701 --> 00:48:05.030
night.

1954
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.863
My,

1955
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:11.150
I had like super bad chest contusion on my chest is still there years later,

1956
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:15.290
the swelling and swelling of my sternum and uh,

1957
00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.540
it would pinch off nerves running down my shoulder.

1958
00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.420
And then I think I actually pinched off the nerve root,

1959
00:48:20.421 --> 00:48:21.680
which is when I started doing the,

1960
00:48:21.681 --> 00:48:22.514
um,

1961
00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:25.970
the decompression with the chiropractor.

1962
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:28.160
And so my left side started like getting,

1963
00:48:28.161 --> 00:48:28.371
like,

1964
00:48:28.371 --> 00:48:29.720
it was noticeably getting smaller,

1965
00:48:29.721 --> 00:48:32.890
like it was the muscle atrophies because we don't know is the WWE,

1966
00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.520
I didn't know you might know it Joe,

1967
00:48:34.521 --> 00:48:34.740
you know,

1968
00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:39.740
everything is that the nerve root actually feeds them the muscle and allows it

1969
00:48:39.831 --> 00:48:40.664
to grow without,

1970
00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:41.720
once that's fucked up,

1971
00:48:41.721 --> 00:48:43.190
then your muscle won't grow anymore.

1972
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:44.360
It's when you atrophy and shit,

1973
00:48:44.361 --> 00:48:47.330
it's very difficult to get into the grow back to if you don't catch it quickly.

1974
00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:47.990
Right.

1975
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.823
And uh,

1976
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:51.210
did you have a problem getting into grow back or did you catch it quick?

1977
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:51.530
Huh?

1978
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:51.711
Well,

1979
00:48:51.711 --> 00:48:54.080
I think when we started doing the decompression and all that stuff,

1980
00:48:54.081 --> 00:48:54.740
it worked.

1981
00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:55.370
Um,

1982
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:56.660
I mean it grew back I think.

1983
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:57.530
Um,

1984
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:58.430
but the,

1985
00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:02.330
the pain that I was feeling from all the shit I kept,

1986
00:49:02.331 --> 00:49:06.080
I kept getting Vicodin prescription for Vicodin or Norco and,

1987
00:49:06.081 --> 00:49:06.650
uh,

1988
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:07.940
you're literally in pain.

1989
00:49:07.941 --> 00:49:09.380
So I would take them the medicine.

1990
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:10.221
But,

1991
00:49:10.221 --> 00:49:11.054
um,

1992
00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.010
after like two months,

1993
00:49:13.011 --> 00:49:15.890
like I looked at my kitchen counter and there was just empty pill bottles,

1994
00:49:15.891 --> 00:49:16.701
like everywhere.

1995
00:49:16.701 --> 00:49:20.180
And I noticed that I was like really fucking aggressive and like short and like

1996
00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.090
I just stopped right away when I,

1997
00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:23.000
when I realized that,

1998
00:49:23.001 --> 00:49:23.640
but I could have told you,

1999
00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.040
you see how that would be,

2000
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:27.530
that could become an addictive thing for sure.

2001
00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.930
That you really need it.

2002
00:49:29.931 --> 00:49:30.201
You know?

2003
00:49:30.201 --> 00:49:32.060
It wasn't like I was like trying to get fucked up.

2004
00:49:32.061 --> 00:49:32.390
I was like,

2005
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.571
Oh,

2006
00:49:32.571 --> 00:49:33.860
I'm in pain and take a pill.

2007
00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:34.701
And then,

2008
00:49:34.701 --> 00:49:35.180
uh,

2009
00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.680
did you go to a doctor and get it looked at?

2010
00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:37.551
Yeah,

2011
00:49:37.551 --> 00:49:38.061
I went to,

2012
00:49:38.061 --> 00:49:39.230
what did they say about your sternum?

2013
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:39.950
Uh,

2014
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:42.710
they said that there was nothing wrong with it and went to the hospital twice.

2015
00:49:42.711 --> 00:49:43.220
I woke up,

2016
00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:43.850
uh,

2017
00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:44.571
America woke up,

2018
00:49:44.571 --> 00:49:48.530
like screaming and shaking from the pain and went to the doctor and the hospital

2019
00:49:48.531 --> 00:49:49.710
and they did an x ray and said,

2020
00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:50.750
there's nothing wrong with that.

2021
00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:51.231
And I'm like,

2022
00:49:51.231 --> 00:49:51.600
look,

2023
00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:52.191
the swelling,

2024
00:49:52.191 --> 00:49:53.450
it looks like a tennis ball.

2025
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:58.400
And they said that it was in our cartilage or between the ribs are really had

2026
00:49:58.401 --> 00:49:59.540
gotten some sort of contusion.

2027
00:49:59.580 --> 00:49:59.691
No,

2028
00:49:59.691 --> 00:50:02.240
somebody gets a hit and elbow and their head swells up.

2029
00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:07.690
The mine was doing that under the rib or under the sternum plates or some shit.

2030
00:50:07.921 --> 00:50:09.230
So there's this constant pressure.

2031
00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:10.910
I just started taking Advil,

2032
00:50:10.911 --> 00:50:15.260
like it was going out of style and then that would make the swelling go down and

2033
00:50:15.261 --> 00:50:16.400
then I wasn't in pain anymore.

2034
00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:20.420
And the problem that I was having with the Vicodin was it's not an anti

2035
00:50:20.421 --> 00:50:21.021
inflammatory.

2036
00:50:21.021 --> 00:50:21.920
So it did nothing for the,

2037
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.570
for the actual cause of the pain.

2038
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:26.180
And I was just eating fucking Vikatin like crazy.

2039
00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:27.830
So,

2040
00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:28.340
um,

2041
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:28.881
<v 4>and then,</v>

2042
00:50:28.881 --> 00:50:29.420
uh,

2043
00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.253
yeah,

2044
00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.850
but now I pretty much eat,

2045
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:37.450
I take Advil every day regardless for my knees hurting or my toes are hurting

2046
00:50:37.921 --> 00:50:38.031
here.

2047
00:50:38.031 --> 00:50:38.151
Like,

2048
00:50:38.151 --> 00:50:40.250
just years of not supposed to fuck with that stuff.

2049
00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:41.993
It's not good.

2050
00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:43.130
Yeah.

2051
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:44.840
You guys do the Onnit gut health,

2052
00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:45.350
right?

2053
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:45.981
Well it's just,

2054
00:50:45.981 --> 00:50:46.580
that'll help.

2055
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.760
I mean in a Kimchi helps to probiotics,

2056
00:50:49.761 --> 00:50:50.480
Kombucha,

2057
00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.313
right?

2058
00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:51.860
It just,

2059
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.500
it ruins your gut health and it causes inflammation.

2060
00:50:54.501 --> 00:50:57.740
This is what my friend Cameron Hanes who runs ultra marathons,

2061
00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.630
he was taking 800 milligrams a day,

2062
00:50:59.631 --> 00:51:00.650
sometimes twice a day.

2063
00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:01.880
And uh,

2064
00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:05.540
cause he was in pain all the time cause he runs fucking dude runs a marathon

2065
00:51:05.541 --> 00:51:06.870
every day on Saturday night.

2066
00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:07.910
This Saturday coming up,

2067
00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:12.320
he's running for 24 hours and his goal is 120 miles in 24 hours.

2068
00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:12.681
I mean,

2069
00:51:12.681 --> 00:51:13.640
he's a fucking maniac.

2070
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:14.960
So this dude's always in pain.

2071
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.640
And uh,

2072
00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.920
I had doctor Rhonda Patrick on and she was explaining about how nonsteroidal

2073
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000
anti inflammatories like Ibuprofen actually cause inflammation because they fuck

2074
00:51:25.191 --> 00:51:28.970
up your gut bacteria and they fuck up your body's ability to process information

2075
00:51:28.971 --> 00:51:29.930
and it causes pain.

2076
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.060
So he listened to,

2077
00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:31.790
there's,

2078
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:34.250
there's connections to stroke and all sorts of other problems.

2079
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:36.350
So he gets off of it and all his pain went away.

2080
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:41.780
His pain was caused in part by the fact that he was taking this stuff for his

2081
00:51:41.781 --> 00:51:42.170
pain,

2082
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:43.220
which is a terrible,

2083
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:44.061
ridiculous,

2084
00:51:44.061 --> 00:51:44.894
vicious cycle.

2085
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:48.500
What's happened for how long straight was he taking?

2086
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:49.490
He was taking it for years.

2087
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.260
For years.

2088
00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:51.561
Yeah,

2089
00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:51.891
he will,

2090
00:51:51.891 --> 00:51:53.090
because he's been a runner forever.

2091
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:57.320
He's been doing marathons and ultra ran 238 miles last year.

2092
00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:58.140
The,

2093
00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:01.010
you know the Moab to 30 which is just the same.

2094
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:01.640
Yeah,

2095
00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.170
we'll have to 40 impossible.

2096
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.310
It takes three days.

2097
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.660
Three fucking days.

2098
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.100
What's really crazy is this.

2099
00:52:07.101 --> 00:52:07.550
Sorry you,

2100
00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:09.350
after the first day he woke up the next day,

2101
00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:11.620
another 24 hours of running.

2102
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:15.770
So there's a type of mindset that you have to have to be able to do something

2103
00:52:15.771 --> 00:52:16.220
like that.

2104
00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.260
That's just superhuman.

2105
00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:17.570
You,

2106
00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:19.940
you have to be able to just every step,

2107
00:52:19.941 --> 00:52:20.451
left foot,

2108
00:52:20.451 --> 00:52:20.901
right foot,

2109
00:52:20.901 --> 00:52:21.291
left foot,

2110
00:52:21.291 --> 00:52:22.124
right foot,

2111
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:23.150
agony and pain.

2112
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.950
All your toenails are falling off.

2113
00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:25.921
Everything's in there.

2114
00:52:25.921 --> 00:52:30.170
I've seen them post pictures of little toes and nasty fucking feel fucked up.

2115
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.710
Yeah.

2116
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:35.390
What's crazy is a woman beat everybody by more than 10 hours.

2117
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:40.460
A woman who I had on her name is Courtney Doh Altar and she beat everybody by 22

2118
00:52:40.461 --> 00:52:41.294
miles.

2119
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:43.940
She was 22 miles ahead of the second place.

2120
00:52:43.941 --> 00:52:44.774
Dude,

2121
00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:46.010
that's unbelievable.

2122
00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.120
She's a fucking animal.

2123
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:49.430
She slept for one minute and three days.

2124
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:51.770
One Minute for a minute.

2125
00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:52.291
Sorry,

2126
00:52:52.291 --> 00:52:53.124
I'm a strong

2127
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.333
chick.

2128
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:57.140
22 miles.

2129
00:52:57.141 --> 00:52:57.501
Come on.

2130
00:52:57.501 --> 00:52:59.390
I don't think steroids help in that world.

2131
00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.160
I think in that world those people are just,

2132
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:02.180
it's just mental.

2133
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:02.900
I really,

2134
00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:07.900
I really don't think it helps get it a little bit.

2135
00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.590
They get sponsors and shit.

2136
00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:10.880
Cam doesn't get paid.

2137
00:53:10.881 --> 00:53:13.870
Me has sponsors under Armour sponsors them and right now,

2138
00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.020
but not really.

2139
00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.210
It's just because they're animals.

2140
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:19.400
I know every step by be like she can,

2141
00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:22.190
she can see it like thinking about what am I doing this for?

2142
00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:26.460
Well it's also you're used to psychotic interactions with other people

2143
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.720
<v 1>in short amount of time.</v>

2144
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.580
Like you used to like 20 minutes and clear description.

2145
00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.473
Chaos.

2146
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:32.221
I mean,

2147
00:53:32.221 --> 00:53:32.521
dude,

2148
00:53:32.521 --> 00:53:32.581
I,

2149
00:53:32.581 --> 00:53:33.900
that last man standing,

2150
00:53:33.901 --> 00:53:35.910
it was one of my favorite events I've ever been to.

2151
00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:37.021
I fucking loved it.

2152
00:53:37.021 --> 00:53:38.970
I don't want you to ever do it again cause I love you.

2153
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:42.630
I don't want to fight fucking four times in a night.

2154
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.171
<v 5>Oh Man.</v>

2155
00:53:43.171 --> 00:53:44.190
I kind of want to do it again.

2156
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.840
It's so crazy.

2157
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:47.640
There's something about doing that.

2158
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:48.533
Uh,

2159
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:49.471
you know,

2160
00:53:49.471 --> 00:53:51.100
you're doing something like special and,

2161
00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:51.960
and uh,

2162
00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:52.230
you know,

2163
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:53.520
epic like that was,

2164
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:54.893
that was my main,

2165
00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:56.280
the last men standing the tournament.

2166
00:53:56.281 --> 00:53:57.870
That was like my main focus after the,

2167
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:03.060
after I knocked outside with Marcus and then I guess after a beat,

2168
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:05.340
after the first two fights going into the third one,

2169
00:54:05.341 --> 00:54:08.760
like I'm pretty sure I wasn't going to beat our two most to beat up.

2170
00:54:08.761 --> 00:54:09.241
But I was like,

2171
00:54:09.241 --> 00:54:13.680
just had this crazy buzz about knowing that it was doing something like special,

2172
00:54:13.681 --> 00:54:15.180
like this was really fucking cool,

2173
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.823
which I like to,

2174
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:18.120
I would love to do it again.

2175
00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:20.950
<v 1>I think that's how those people feel when they're running those crazy ultra</v>

2176
00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:23.350
marathons to do something insane.

2177
00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:28.810
They've been a regular fight is insane to regular fights in the night is insane.

2178
00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:33.670
Three regular fights in the night against worldclass kickboxers and then the

2179
00:54:33.671 --> 00:54:37.270
first fight you had to go four rounds because after three rounds it was a draw.

2180
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:39.700
What in the fuck man,

2181
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:40.381
<v 5>that's good.</v>

2182
00:54:40.381 --> 00:54:40.830
Notify it.

2183
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:42.810
Had to do that shit right now if you

2184
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:45.343
get excited here.

2185
00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:50.243
<v 1>I liked her.</v>

2186
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:51.960
I've always loved tournaments.

2187
00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:54.770
I've always wanted to be in like a day tournament.

2188
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:57.740
<v 5>I said it'd be dope.</v>

2189
00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:04.390
<v 1>Now you're making your move back to MMA because kickboxing is just not what it</v>

2190
00:55:05.991 --> 00:55:06.681
should be.

2191
00:55:06.681 --> 00:55:07.910
I think we both feel that.

2192
00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:08.600
Yeah.

2193
00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.240
Kickboxing is one of my favorite things to watch.

2194
00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:15.650
I'm a giant fan of it and for whatever reason it is just not caught on in

2195
00:55:15.651 --> 00:55:19.000
America the same way boxing has or the same way MMA hat.

2196
00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.800
<v 5>It's map and I've spent my whole,</v>

2197
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:27.410
well I meant doing this since I was 15 I'm 34 so all of that type I've been

2198
00:55:27.411 --> 00:55:29.270
thinking about this same question and then I'm just,

2199
00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:30.163
you know,

2200
00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.130
um,

2201
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:32.060
it is what it is.

2202
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:32.900
Yeah.

2203
00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:34.430
It's like you can't hold onto it anymore.

2204
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:35.091
At least not for me.

2205
00:55:35.091 --> 00:55:36.050
The sport is going to grow,

2206
00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:36.840
is going to keep,

2207
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.521
keep doing good.

2208
00:55:37.521 --> 00:55:39.800
And I hope that that continues.

2209
00:55:39.801 --> 00:55:40.634
But for me,

2210
00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:42.230
I need to do a to keep,

2211
00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.340
keep progressing,

2212
00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.293
so to speak.

2213
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.823
That is a

2214
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:47.271
<v 1>did.</v>

2215
00:55:47.271 --> 00:55:48.050
Here's what it is.

2216
00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:48.291
I mean,

2217
00:55:48.291 --> 00:55:52.070
that's the best way to put it because there's no way we're gonna fix it,

2218
00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:54.380
but I don't understand,

2219
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.801
you know?

2220
00:55:54.801 --> 00:55:55.071
I mean,

2221
00:55:55.071 --> 00:55:55.551
I really,

2222
00:55:55.551 --> 00:55:56.780
really don't understand.

2223
00:55:56.810 --> 00:56:00.770
I fucking love watching kickboxing and when people tell me about how they love

2224
00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:01.251
boxing,

2225
00:56:01.251 --> 00:56:01.520
I'm like,

2226
00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.091
that's great.

2227
00:56:02.091 --> 00:56:02.781
Boxing is great.

2228
00:56:02.781 --> 00:56:05.750
I love boxing to kickboxing is way better than boxing,

2229
00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.130
right?

2230
00:56:06.130 --> 00:56:08.600
That that extra level of,

2231
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:09.020
you know,

2232
00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:10.940
throwing in kicks and knees and,

2233
00:56:10.941 --> 00:56:14.180
and especially if you go to [inaudible] elbows and clinch,

2234
00:56:14.181 --> 00:56:14.840
it's just,

2235
00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:15.800
it's a wilder,

2236
00:56:15.801 --> 00:56:18.020
crazier striking sport.

2237
00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:20.150
And I just don't understand it.

2238
00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:20.990
I mean,

2239
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:22.950
when I watch you fight,

2240
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:24.370
or Kevin fied

2241
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:25.560
<v 4>or you know,</v>

2242
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.610
Kevin Ross or Giorgio Petrosian,

2243
00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:28.890
John Wayne par,

2244
00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:28.991
like,

2245
00:56:28.991 --> 00:56:30.640
how the fuck would you not want to watch that?

2246
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:32.830
It's so exciting.

2247
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.350
<v 5>And then continuously like that.</v>

2248
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:36.500
They just don't,

2249
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:37.400
they just don't tune in.

2250
00:56:37.401 --> 00:56:37.940
This doesn't,

2251
00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:38.740
it's like,

2252
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:39.230
fuck,

2253
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:40.190
I don't know what it is.

2254
00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:41.240
I just don't understand this.

2255
00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:44.140
Does Beltour have real problems with their ratings when they air it?

2256
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:44.990
Um,

2257
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.310
I've,

2258
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:47.450
I don't know exactly what the ratings are.

2259
00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:48.171
I know that they're,

2260
00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:48.770
uh,

2261
00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:49.431
they're average.

2262
00:56:49.431 --> 00:56:52.550
They're not super fantastic on any,

2263
00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:56.600
<v 4>so it's below what the average is for the MMA fights.</v>

2264
00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:57.410
Yeah.

2265
00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.591
Yeah,

2266
00:56:57.591 --> 00:56:58.100
for sure.

2267
00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:58.461
Man.

2268
00:56:58.461 --> 00:56:59.294
It's a bummer.

2269
00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:02.510
It's a real fucking bummer because for you,

2270
00:57:02.511 --> 00:57:03.800
for anybody who is a fan,

2271
00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:05.780
anybody who likes watching it like shit.

2272
00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:08.060
Like that event in La,

2273
00:57:08.061 --> 00:57:09.110
that last man standing,

2274
00:57:09.111 --> 00:57:09.681
holy fuck.

2275
00:57:09.681 --> 00:57:10.514
Was that fun?

2276
00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:11.990
That was crazy.

2277
00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:12.291
Yeah,

2278
00:57:12.291 --> 00:57:12.630
that was,

2279
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:16.010
that was probably one of the best kickboxing events was the buscot boxing event

2280
00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:16.863
I've ever been too.

2281
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.421
Yeah,

2282
00:57:17.421 --> 00:57:17.811
me too.

2283
00:57:17.811 --> 00:57:19.760
The whole energy and the forum just in general,

2284
00:57:19.761 --> 00:57:21.780
the layout of that was bad ass that,

2285
00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:22.131
yeah,

2286
00:57:22.131 --> 00:57:23.390
the farm is perfect for that.

2287
00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:23.681
I mean it,

2288
00:57:23.681 --> 00:57:25.340
and everybody knew it was a special night.

2289
00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:26.870
Like it was that it was crazy.

2290
00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.430
You know that they were doing this,

2291
00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:29.481
you know,

2292
00:57:29.481 --> 00:57:33.590
what is it like knowing that like how much time do you have in between your

2293
00:57:33.591 --> 00:57:38.210
second and third fight and everything is fucked up and sore and you know,

2294
00:57:38.211 --> 00:57:39.710
you're about to go into another fight.

2295
00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.713
Uh,

2296
00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:44.620
<v 5>I think it's probably like 30 minutes,</v>

2297
00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:45.071
30,

2298
00:57:45.071 --> 00:57:45.904
40 minutes,

2299
00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:46.803
maybe one more.

2300
00:57:46.810 --> 00:57:48.100
One other fight between you.

2301
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.440
<v 4>So just enough time for everything to start hurting.</v>

2302
00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:51.393
Yeah.

2303
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:52.360
Yeah.

2304
00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.193
Um,

2305
00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:55.610
<v 5>yeah,</v>

2306
00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:56.780
I guess I was just,

2307
00:57:56.781 --> 00:57:57.560
because of the money,

2308
00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:00.740
like I knew that like each time my father was going to get more money and that

2309
00:58:00.741 --> 00:58:02.300
was like my focus in the 30 minutes.

2310
00:58:02.301 --> 00:58:04.040
Like not wanting to go back out,

2311
00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:05.300
never crossed my mind,

2312
00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:06.673
you know?

2313
00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.900
Versus if I think if I wasn't getting paid for it,

2314
00:58:08.901 --> 00:58:09.230
I'd be like,

2315
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.800
oh,

2316
00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:10.633
that's cool.

2317
00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:10.941
Yeah,

2318
00:58:10.941 --> 00:58:11.570
that was fine.

2319
00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:12.403
You know what I mean?

2320
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:15.110
So that's why I was asking him about those ultra marathons,

2321
00:58:15.111 --> 00:58:17.680
how they actually get paid for it or not.

2322
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:19.580
Cause I don't think that would be my main focus.

2323
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:20.510
<v 4>You say that.</v>

2324
00:58:20.810 --> 00:58:22.850
But I think that if you were there,

2325
00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:26.630
just your competitive spirit would kick in and you would go,

2326
00:58:26.631 --> 00:58:28.350
let me see what I could fucking do here.

2327
00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.350
Give me another minute hand and a cigarette.

2328
00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:31.213
Yeah.

2329
00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:34.280
Mile 79 and you're like,

2330
00:58:34.281 --> 00:58:38.620
shit I'll have to do is 21 more miles.

2331
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:39.500
I could do that.

2332
00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.230
Do you think you'd like to fight in a tournament?

2333
00:58:45.231 --> 00:58:46.041
Like old school,

2334
00:58:46.041 --> 00:58:47.270
Ufc one style?

2335
00:58:47.370 --> 00:58:47.610
<v 0>Oh,</v>

2336
00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:49.350
just one to uh,

2337
00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:49.830
you know,

2338
00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:51.630
being part of build towards tournament.

2339
00:58:51.631 --> 00:58:53.430
It was dope being a part of like a,

2340
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:54.240
you know,

2341
00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.230
monthly tournament.

2342
00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:56.640
We always wanted it to be like,

2343
00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:57.720
you know,

2344
00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.021
yeah.

2345
00:58:58.021 --> 00:59:00.510
It was good wood again,

2346
00:59:00.511 --> 00:59:00.781
you know,

2347
00:59:00.781 --> 00:59:03.780
finding some of the best fighters in the world three times a night.

2348
00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:04.441
Yeah.

2349
00:59:04.441 --> 00:59:06.300
That's really what it's going to touch you to me.

2350
00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:07.980
So yeah,

2351
00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:10.140
there's so many factors involved.

2352
00:59:10.141 --> 00:59:10.861
So many variables,

2353
00:59:10.861 --> 00:59:11.071
right?

2354
00:59:11.071 --> 00:59:12.380
Like your opponent could get up

2355
00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.770
<v 4>quick first round knockout,</v>

2356
00:59:13.771 --> 00:59:14.190
right.

2357
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:16.050
And you could go a three round war,

2358
00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:16.831
you know,

2359
00:59:16.831 --> 00:59:18.510
and then you face each other in the next round.

2360
00:59:18.511 --> 00:59:19.344
It's just,

2361
00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:22.760
I get the not wanting to do it anymore.

2362
00:59:22.761 --> 00:59:23.594
I get it.

2363
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:25.610
The only place that would let you do is probably like one of them,

2364
00:59:25.611 --> 00:59:26.990
native American casinos.

2365
00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:27.591
It's like,

2366
00:59:27.591 --> 00:59:31.580
come on and Bob will actually come on in the commission.

2367
00:59:31.581 --> 00:59:32.660
Is the commission a problem?

2368
00:59:32.661 --> 00:59:33.890
I think they would do it in California.

2369
00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:36.110
Do you think that they did with glory when I did it?

2370
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:36.411
Yeah,

2371
00:59:36.411 --> 00:59:37.430
but that's kickboxing.

2372
00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:40.250
I don't know if they would do that with MMA kickboxing.

2373
00:59:40.251 --> 00:59:41.180
It's wildly,

2374
00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:41.480
uh,

2375
00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:43.040
widely criticized though.

2376
00:59:43.041 --> 00:59:44.660
A lot of people think that was a bad idea.

2377
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:48.680
I think the way they can do it with kickboxing is because of boxing.

2378
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:49.450
The boxing,

2379
00:59:49.450 --> 00:59:51.830
a rule set is like you have up to 12 rounds or whatever.

2380
00:59:51.831 --> 00:59:52.910
So for kickboxing,

2381
00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:54.293
that's three fights.

2382
00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:54.770
Right,

2383
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:55.310
right,

2384
00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:55.431
right,

2385
00:59:55.431 --> 00:59:55.850
right.

2386
00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:56.121
Yeah.

2387
00:59:56.121 --> 00:59:58.580
I don't know how that works with them in a manner that makes sense with

2388
00:59:58.581 --> 00:59:59.300
kickboxing.

2389
00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:00.020
That make sense?

2390
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:04.220
Because I think they probably would have a hard time saying like of Daniel can

2391
01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:06.020
fight 10 rounds of MMA tonight.

2392
01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:10.430
That's probably what's the most rounds of kickbox and you've ever fought in the

2393
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.520
night.

2394
01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.470
But other than that,

2395
01:00:11.471 --> 01:00:13.310
that tournament like one single fight,

2396
01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:15.040
<v 5>oh five,</v>

2397
01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.840
five rounds when I was fighting weight times always.

2398
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:18.490
I'll always like that.

2399
01:00:18.491 --> 01:00:19.060
Right.

2400
01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:19.893
Why is that?

2401
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:20.650
Um,

2402
01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:25.000
I think that the rule set in Thailand is a based,

2403
01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:26.740
primarily around gambling.

2404
01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:28.750
It's like human cock fighting is what,

2405
01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:33.250
when we tie ism in Thailand essentially it sounds negative but it's kind of that

2406
01:00:33.251 --> 01:00:34.030
way.

2407
01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.240
Everybody in the audience is,

2408
01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.450
is gambling and they're betting out yelling and uh,

2409
01:00:38.890 --> 01:00:39.790
motioning back and forth,

2410
01:00:39.791 --> 01:00:40.421
the treatment bedding.

2411
01:00:40.421 --> 01:00:42.160
So like in Thailand it's a three minute round,

2412
01:00:42.161 --> 01:00:43.090
but it's two minute rest,

2413
01:00:43.091 --> 01:00:45.850
which I think is awesome is awesome.

2414
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:47.200
But yeah,

2415
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:50.260
I fought for the WBC world title over there and wow.

2416
01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:51.483
What year was this?

2417
01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:55.270
I don't know Jamie.

2418
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:57.703
<v 4>They play the music.</v>

2419
01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:58.951
Yeah,

2420
01:00:58.951 --> 01:00:59.341
for sure.

2421
01:00:59.341 --> 01:01:00.174
And I find it out.

2422
01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.110
<v 5>Roger Dominant in stadium and Thailand,</v>

2423
01:01:02.111 --> 01:01:02.950
which is like one of them.

2424
01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:03.843
Wow.

2425
01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.270
And a loop.

2426
01:01:05.271 --> 01:01:07.400
Vinny are the two big ones.

2427
01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.530
So I fought over there.

2428
01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:09.483
Um,

2429
01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:10.840
uh,

2430
01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.950
the two minute rest is cool except that you kind of run out of things to talk

2431
01:01:14.951 --> 01:01:15.784
about,

2432
01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:17.530
<v 4>like my coach now.</v>

2433
01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:21.950
<v 5>So I'm like looking at ring girls and they go out and you find a tie guy?</v>

2434
01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:22.940
Uh,

2435
01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:23.390
no,

2436
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:24.081
I'm both times.

2437
01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:27.380
No first time I fought a guy from Argentina at Roger Under in stadium.

2438
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:30.040
And the second time I fought a car,

2439
01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:34.520
a pet Carpathian from golden glory gym for the WBC world title.

2440
01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.780
<v 4>Now when you,</v>

2441
01:01:35.790 --> 01:01:36.500
um,

2442
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.180
fight over there in Thailand,

2443
01:01:38.181 --> 01:01:42.290
did they still expect Westerners to take it easy on that first round?

2444
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:46.880
Because the idea is during the first round most ties they go fairly light

2445
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:49.820
because there were ready for the bedding to get established.

2446
01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:50.713
They don't want any one of them.

2447
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:54.880
<v 5>I think you don't want to come out too strong because then nobody will bet on</v>

2448
01:01:54.881 --> 01:01:56.200
you are against the other person.

2449
01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:57.300
Hmm.

2450
01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:58.133
Um,

2451
01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.340
I don't think they expect that from the foreigners though.

2452
01:02:00.341 --> 01:02:02.800
I think just as a whole,

2453
01:02:02.801 --> 01:02:04.090
they think that the foreigner suck.

2454
01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:04.510
I'm like,

2455
01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:06.420
they think like foreign is won't block lake kicks.

2456
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:09.250
A lot of times you'll see like the ties come out and just wreck the fucking

2457
01:02:09.251 --> 01:02:10.690
foreigner in the first round if again,

2458
01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:12.820
so yeah,

2459
01:02:12.821 --> 01:02:13.490
I don't think they,

2460
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:16.740
they're expecting the forerunners to participate.

2461
01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:17.593
Yeah.

2462
01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:22.620
<v 4>I would love to go back in time and watch Ramon decker right when he first got</v>

2463
01:02:22.621 --> 01:02:22.920
there.

2464
01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.610
Right.

2465
01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:24.970
And that was like the golden era

2466
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:26.760
<v 5>when we tie in like the nineties,</v>

2467
01:02:26.761 --> 01:02:28.620
when when they didn't have the,

2468
01:02:28.621 --> 01:02:29.454
uh,

2469
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:30.480
you know,

2470
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.740
like right now it's the first round.

2471
01:02:31.741 --> 01:02:33.510
They don't really fight the second and third round.

2472
01:02:33.511 --> 01:02:37.860
They fight in the fourth round that they may or may not fight depending on who

2473
01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:39.390
won,

2474
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:40.590
who won the first two.

2475
01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.050
They take it off because Brown,

2476
01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:43.650
they do nothing really.

2477
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.191
I mean,

2478
01:02:44.191 --> 01:02:44.701
not nothing,

2479
01:02:44.701 --> 01:02:45.570
but almost nothing.

2480
01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.850
They're not really trying to win because they know they're going to fight in a

2481
01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:47.910
week.

2482
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:48.743
Right.

2483
01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:50.820
And then like in the golden era was like,

2484
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:53.690
when like those guys would come out and just,

2485
01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:54.573
it was,

2486
01:02:54.610 --> 01:02:57.060
it's a prime time and everybody would fight every round.

2487
01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.013
And uh,

2488
01:02:58.350 --> 01:02:59.910
it was supposedly was better.

2489
01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.360
<v 4>Does Ramon decker fights?</v>

2490
01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:03.340
Anybody who doesn't know anything about Moyie Thai,

2491
01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:08.580
go on Youtube right now and watch Ramon Dekkers and watch chaos.

2492
01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.193
That dude,

2493
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:14.040
he fought guys who was his size to that was the,

2494
01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:16.840
what was interesting about him is like he was a small guy.

2495
01:03:16.841 --> 01:03:19.660
It wasn't like a big guy who's about going over there to fight the ties.

2496
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.310
He was their size.

2497
01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.091
Yeah.

2498
01:03:22.091 --> 01:03:23.080
And he felt like the top,

2499
01:03:23.081 --> 01:03:23.351
top,

2500
01:03:23.351 --> 01:03:23.630
top

2501
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:24.650
<v 5>guys and like the,</v>

2502
01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:25.880
and like their prime,

2503
01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:28.940
which is pretty rare now you see like Sanchez,

2504
01:03:28.941 --> 01:03:31.060
super famous but like same chai isn't is,

2505
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:35.540
is like the celebrity guy who's fighting like the older,

2506
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:36.880
heavier ties like the,

2507
01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:39.770
the top ties right now in Thailand at like 120 pounds,

2508
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:43.960
15 pounds and they're like 16 years old.

2509
01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:44.990
There's like the top guys,

2510
01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:45.943
right?

2511
01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:50.000
Then you build a name where you're big enough name that the foreigners know

2512
01:03:50.001 --> 01:03:52.580
about you and the rest of the world and market you.

2513
01:03:52.581 --> 01:03:53.414
And then you fight.

2514
01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:54.283
You know,

2515
01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:56.620
you go to America and you find it an American,

2516
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:57.463
you'd go to wherever.

2517
01:03:58.210 --> 01:03:59.043
So you be like,

2518
01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.073
uh,

2519
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:01.251
San Chai,

2520
01:04:01.251 --> 01:04:02.084
blue cow.

2521
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.840
Those guys.

2522
01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.690
<v 4>He's fighting constantly and he seems to be fighting on the road a lot.</v>

2523
01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:09.110
I'll go to these weird places and fight some dude who looks like he's in real

2524
01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:10.670
trouble almost immediately.

2525
01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:11.240
Right.

2526
01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:11.770
You know?

2527
01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:12.230
Yeah.

2528
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.681
Well they're like,

2529
01:04:12.681 --> 01:04:12.921
oh,

2530
01:04:12.921 --> 01:04:14.990
we're going to bring San shy over for this fight.

2531
01:04:14.991 --> 01:04:15.340
And then they got,

2532
01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:16.430
we've got to fight somebody.

2533
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:17.511
They had tired.

2534
01:04:17.511 --> 01:04:17.840
Uh,

2535
01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.880
and then a lot of times the ties don't fight each other.

2536
01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:23.270
Like it's very rare that you'll see outside of like a tie stadium.

2537
01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:24.953
<v 5>Um,</v>

2538
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.201
you know,

2539
01:04:25.201 --> 01:04:25.570
you never,

2540
01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:26.130
you're hardly,

2541
01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:31.130
you're not going to see Yahtzee Cli fi blue cow or like a tie versus tie.

2542
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:36.190
They rent the ties to kill the foreigners and then still be on the same team.

2543
01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:40.610
<v 4>Sanchez got such an interesting style too because if you looked at him,</v>

2544
01:04:40.611 --> 01:04:43.390
if you only saw like a silhouette and you saw him move around,

2545
01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.181
you'd go immediately.

2546
01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:44.301
Oh,

2547
01:04:44.301 --> 01:04:45.134
that Sanchez.

2548
01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.090
You could tell instantly.

2549
01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:47.460
Yeah.

2550
01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.100
This is a constantly moving,

2551
01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.060
shuffling his feet,

2552
01:04:50.061 --> 01:04:50.990
switching back and forth,

2553
01:04:50.991 --> 01:04:51.920
real light on his feet.

2554
01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:53.630
He just moves different than everybody else.

2555
01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:58.250
He does like the old web or on some wiper on was like the original martial art

2556
01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.120
of the,

2557
01:04:59.121 --> 01:04:59.970
turned it into [inaudible].

2558
01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:04.700
If you watch like the old Tony John like on bark or they are like whatever and

2559
01:05:04.701 --> 01:05:06.680
they run up on your leg and like dropping the ball on your head.

2560
01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.300
It's like the Weber on stuff.

2561
01:05:08.301 --> 01:05:10.520
And like a lot of the techniques that Sandra does,

2562
01:05:10.521 --> 01:05:13.520
like the cartwheel kick or like the games that he plays,

2563
01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:13.810
uh,

2564
01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:16.730
alert Silla is another one that's really similar to him from the wash.

2565
01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:17.140
You just,

2566
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:17.973
when they've met

2567
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.310
<v 1>Laird,</v>

2568
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:21.610
Zillow fight in lion fight against a do with zero fights.

2569
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.660
Yeah.

2570
01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:26.560
They let them fight with zero fights.

2571
01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:30.630
The dude had zero Muay Thai fights over 400.

2572
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:35.470
He got up to the top and he had kicked this dude into another dimension.

2573
01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:37.410
But it was one of those things where you,

2574
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.300
it was inevitable from the first minute of the first round.

2575
01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:40.610
You're like,

2576
01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:42.070
this guy was an MMA fighter,

2577
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:43.270
not a bad fighter,

2578
01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:45.610
but just doesn't belong in there with Laird Zillow.

2579
01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:47.290
It was ridiculous.

2580
01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.243
Yeah.

2581
01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:51.130
And when would I put it online?

2582
01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:51.340
The,

2583
01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:55.360
please don't ever do that again with Conor Mcgregor's going to fight Floyd

2584
01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.193
Mayweather.

2585
01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:56.501
Yeah.

2586
01:05:56.501 --> 01:05:57.550
That's for $100 million,

2587
01:05:57.551 --> 01:05:57.890
bro.

2588
01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:58.260
Yeah.

2589
01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:58.961
Kind of different.

2590
01:05:58.961 --> 01:06:02.420
Pretty sure lying if I didn't pay that guy anywhere close to that team,

2591
01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:06.310
pretty sure like I got his head knocked off for 1000 bucks and it wasn't the

2592
01:06:06.311 --> 01:06:06.641
same.

2593
01:06:06.641 --> 01:06:08.380
That guy's not Conor McGregor either,

2594
01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:08.980
you know?

2595
01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:09.670
Right.

2596
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.881
I mean,

2597
01:06:09.881 --> 01:06:13.260
if Conor Mcgregor fraud alert Zilla and MMA fight or more Thai fight,

2598
01:06:13.261 --> 01:06:13.541
I go,

2599
01:06:13.541 --> 01:06:14.230
okay,

2600
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:15.160
let's see what happens.

2601
01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:15.791
You know?

2602
01:06:15.791 --> 01:06:16.031
I mean,

2603
01:06:16.031 --> 01:06:16.960
I don't think he's going to win,

2604
01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:17.601
but that,

2605
01:06:17.601 --> 01:06:18.730
that might be interesting.

2606
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:20.260
But you know,

2607
01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:22.140
seeing those guys and the,

2608
01:06:22.141 --> 01:06:22.251
the,

2609
01:06:22.251 --> 01:06:26.890
the real high level guys and seeing like what they're able to do,

2610
01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:29.230
seeing them the way they move and it's like,

2611
01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:31.150
it's so important for,

2612
01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:35.680
especially for MMA guys that don't understand the levels of striking,

2613
01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:36.170
right.

2614
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:36.700
There's,

2615
01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:38.470
when guys are just striking,

2616
01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:39.520
there are just,

2617
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:43.210
there's some elite upon elite upon elite levels,

2618
01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:44.530
you know?

2619
01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:44.711
I mean,

2620
01:06:44.711 --> 01:06:44.981
it's,

2621
01:06:44.981 --> 01:06:45.814
um,

2622
01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:47.590
it's such a black belt versus a blue belt.

2623
01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:48.160
Yeah.

2624
01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.630
Be like a really bad ass blue belt.

2625
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:50.441
And then he'd be like,

2626
01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:51.251
go to the black belt.

2627
01:06:51.251 --> 01:06:52.570
You're just completely lost.

2628
01:06:52.571 --> 01:06:54.820
Like it's not even close to just getting dominated.

2629
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:55.271
Yeah,

2630
01:06:55.271 --> 01:06:57.730
you can just get shut down,

2631
01:06:58.330 --> 01:06:58.640
you know,

2632
01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.260
or like you're a good high school wrestler and he'd go against like,

2633
01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:02.213
you know world chair.

2634
01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:03.140
Oh yeah.

2635
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:05.223
Yeah.

2636
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:05.591
That's,

2637
01:07:05.591 --> 01:07:09.430
I mean one of the more unique things about combat sports is that there are these

2638
01:07:09.431 --> 01:07:09.761
deep,

2639
01:07:09.761 --> 01:07:11.500
deep levels and you don't,

2640
01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.200
you know,

2641
01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:15.610
sometimes you need to see like a guy like Khabib,

2642
01:07:15.611 --> 01:07:17.140
number of Madoff is a perfect example.

2643
01:07:17.141 --> 01:07:22.100
You got to see him fight against guys who you know are bad ass and see him smush

2644
01:07:22.101 --> 01:07:22.470
them.

2645
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:23.570
Just the real difference.

2646
01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:23.850
Right?

2647
01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:24.090
Yeah.

2648
01:07:24.090 --> 01:07:25.450
They realize like where this guy's at,

2649
01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:26.530
cause he's not doing anything.

2650
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:29.830
It's not like he's doing it jumped three 60 wheel kicks in there that nobody

2651
01:07:29.831 --> 01:07:30.341
else can do.

2652
01:07:30.341 --> 01:07:32.200
He's doing things that everybody else does.

2653
01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:33.221
He's just doing,

2654
01:07:33.221 --> 01:07:35.380
I'm at a level that no one else is doing it now.

2655
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:36.703
<v 0>It's crazy.</v>

2656
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:37.920
He's wrestling.

2657
01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.920
It's like 10 times the level of like a lot of Russell's off say it could be,

2658
01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:45.190
have you ever trained with them?

2659
01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:49.570
Never tried or have you just impressing me with like,

2660
01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.130
yeah,

2661
01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:50.900
watching them fight.

2662
01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.190
<v 1>Who is the best wrestler?</v>

2663
01:07:52.191 --> 01:07:53.600
A American talked to him when you were there,

2664
01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.233
what would you think?

2665
01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:55.621
Do you think?

2666
01:07:55.621 --> 01:07:56.341
So best restaurant?

2667
01:07:56.341 --> 01:07:56.411
Yeah.

2668
01:07:56.411 --> 01:07:56.490
You

2669
01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.640
<v 0>train with it.</v>

2670
01:07:58.780 --> 01:07:59.700
What did I mean?

2671
01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:02.010
Wasn't a fighter had to be Brownie?

2672
01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:03.020
I mean,

2673
01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:03.853
brownies a dog.

2674
01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:05.790
Just coach wise.

2675
01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:06.683
He was just,

2676
01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:07.763
what's his name?

2677
01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:08.963
Mike Browning.

2678
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:11.100
Browning.

2679
01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:11.860
Mike Brown wouldn't,

2680
01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:13.960
where's he out of att?

2681
01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:14.251
No,

2682
01:08:14.251 --> 01:08:16.430
but where it was he dresser.

2683
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:17.570
I'm saying Mike Brown,

2684
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:17.780
again,

2685
01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:18.501
not a,

2686
01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:19.180
um,

2687
01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:19.480
a,

2688
01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:20.900
a fighter was a coach,

2689
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.800
Mike Brown and was probably the best wrestler at,

2690
01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:23.061
Oh,

2691
01:08:23.061 --> 01:08:23.960
the coach was

2692
01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:26.293
interesting.

2693
01:08:26.690 --> 01:08:28.810
Mike Brown in which he has had his hands.

2694
01:08:28.811 --> 01:08:30.980
He was some movement and strength.

2695
01:08:31.690 --> 01:08:32.630
It's just a dog.

2696
01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.860
And he wasn't a fighter.

2697
01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:35.090
Not just coaching.

2698
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.923
Wrestling.

2699
01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.233
Yeah.

2700
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:38.210
But he,

2701
01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:39.530
he had a college career too though.

2702
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.951
Yeah.

2703
01:08:39.951 --> 01:08:40.521
Why did it go?

2704
01:08:40.521 --> 01:08:42.230
I think he was in Boston maybe.

2705
01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:45.830
Or what was my Brownie from up north somewhere.

2706
01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.620
<v 1>So he's never had any MMA fights?</v>

2707
01:08:48.010 --> 01:08:48.281
<v 0>No.</v>

2708
01:08:48.281 --> 01:08:49.031
Brownie has.

2709
01:08:49.031 --> 01:08:49.480
Yeah.

2710
01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.510
How many of you fuck,

2711
01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:51.300
fuck,

2712
01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:52.133
fuck off.

2713
01:08:52.330 --> 01:08:53.350
Fought for the UFC.

2714
01:08:53.351 --> 01:08:54.700
Fought for fucking,

2715
01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.473
um,

2716
01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.920
what was that before UFC,

2717
01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:00.210
what were that younger,

2718
01:09:00.211 --> 01:09:01.044
um,

2719
01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:03.160
beat Uriah,

2720
01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:04.203
uh,

2721
01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:04.690
you know,

2722
01:09:04.690 --> 01:09:06.330
had a very easy WC.

2723
01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:07.630
I had a good career.

2724
01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:08.411
<v 1>Oh,</v>

2725
01:09:08.411 --> 01:09:09.221
Mike Brown,

2726
01:09:09.221 --> 01:09:10.054
your son.

2727
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:11.270
You're seeing browning.

2728
01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.120
Oh,

2729
01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.030
his Mike Brown.

2730
01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:13.751
I was like,

2731
01:09:13.751 --> 01:09:14.584
who is this browning?

2732
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:14.900
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2733
01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:15.341
So I said,

2734
01:09:15.341 --> 01:09:15.520
I'm like,

2735
01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.050
what the fuck this is talking about it.

2736
01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:21.160
I still don't know the fuck he fought for the UFC.

2737
01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:23.530
I'm going through my Rolodex.

2738
01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:24.220
Browning.

2739
01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:25.060
Browning Browning.

2740
01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:25.923
Who's browning?

2741
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.080
Fuck No.

2742
01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:28.010
Mike Brown's referenced.

2743
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.870
No,

2744
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:29.320
he's a,

2745
01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.970
he was a bad motherfucker in his day.

2746
01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:31.621
Cool.

2747
01:09:31.621 --> 01:09:32.454
Mother fucker too.

2748
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:33.141
Very good dude.

2749
01:09:33.141 --> 01:09:34.140
When I was done at eight 30,

2750
01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:34.861
like he was boiling.

2751
01:09:34.861 --> 01:09:36.010
Favorite person I fuck with,

2752
01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:36.910
I don't think of,

2753
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:37.031
well,

2754
01:09:37.031 --> 01:09:37.460
he's a great

2755
01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:38.211
<v 1>coach now too.</v>

2756
01:09:38.211 --> 01:09:42.050
He was in Colby Covington scoring or this weekend and I told me after the fight,

2757
01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:42.261
he's like,

2758
01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:42.501
dude,

2759
01:09:42.501 --> 01:09:44.360
this kid's cardio is insane.

2760
01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:45.021
He's like,

2761
01:09:45.021 --> 01:09:45.621
it's insane.

2762
01:09:45.621 --> 01:09:45.801
He goes,

2763
01:09:45.801 --> 01:09:47.000
I think it might be like a,

2764
01:09:47.001 --> 01:09:48.590
just a natural gift that he has.

2765
01:09:48.591 --> 01:09:48.890
I mean,

2766
01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:49.790
he trains really,

2767
01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:50.624
really hard,

2768
01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:51.560
but he said his cardio,

2769
01:09:51.561 --> 01:09:52.700
it was just off the charts.

2770
01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:54.110
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

2771
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.710
Yeah.

2772
01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:55.370
Interesting.

2773
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:57.380
It's funny how much attention he's like,

2774
01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.870
I don't know if he wasn't that good before,

2775
01:09:59.871 --> 01:10:02.180
but this is why he got a ton of fucking intention.

2776
01:10:02.181 --> 01:10:03.260
As soon he started talking shit.

2777
01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.490
Oh for sure.

2778
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:07.460
And they just taught as the champ or in the room.

2779
01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:07.931
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2780
01:10:07.931 --> 01:10:10.360
well the talking shit got him to the dance.

2781
01:10:10.361 --> 01:10:11.450
But beating Maya,

2782
01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:12.460
the way he beat Maya,

2783
01:10:12.490 --> 01:10:13.960
everybody had to open their eyes up and go,

2784
01:10:13.961 --> 01:10:14.620
Huh.

2785
01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:15.970
But a lot of people had doubts.

2786
01:10:15.971 --> 01:10:16.680
They were like,

2787
01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.060
dos Anjos is a fucking straight up assassin.

2788
01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:20.590
He's going in there again against,

2789
01:10:20.591 --> 01:10:21.430
they got fucked up.

2790
01:10:21.431 --> 01:10:22.264
Robbie Lawler,

2791
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:23.021
Gow Merch,

2792
01:10:23.021 --> 01:10:25.480
Neil Magni like how's he going to beat this guy?

2793
01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:26.800
And he beat the shit out of him.

2794
01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:28.680
He literally beat him every round.

2795
01:10:28.681 --> 01:10:30.690
I was crazy like he watching,

2796
01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:34.960
I mean maybe you could give the first round of Dos Anjos and you know,

2797
01:10:34.961 --> 01:10:37.120
he was always a threat because he's still got power.

2798
01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:40.120
But Colby is just on and it was like Nick Diaz style,

2799
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:40.901
just pop,

2800
01:10:40.901 --> 01:10:41.261
pop,

2801
01:10:41.261 --> 01:10:41.891
constantly.

2802
01:10:41.891 --> 01:10:43.240
Constant attack,

2803
01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:44.470
constant kicking them,

2804
01:10:44.471 --> 01:10:45.490
constant punching him.

2805
01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:46.990
I was very impressed

2806
01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:49.770
<v 3>back and watch it and then see it.</v>

2807
01:10:49.771 --> 01:10:50.720
So I can't really say anything.

2808
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:54.180
<v 1>Very impressive men that the most impressive thing was the pace he put on them.</v>

2809
01:10:54.181 --> 01:10:54.541
Cause they'll,

2810
01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:59.520
Santos is known for his cardio and he had a real problem with that cardio when

2811
01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:02.820
he was at one 55 cause he had diminished his body so much and then he moves up

2812
01:11:02.821 --> 01:11:03.870
to one 70 and you're like,

2813
01:11:03.871 --> 01:11:06.420
well now he literally doubled his output.

2814
01:11:06.450 --> 01:11:11.340
If you look at the strikes per minute in the 155 pound division and then one 70

2815
01:11:11.341 --> 01:11:15.060
it was double at one 70 and still Colby melted them.

2816
01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:16.500
Just just stayed,

2817
01:11:16.501 --> 01:11:17.750
stayed on and kept that heat on.

2818
01:11:17.751 --> 01:11:18.584
It was crazy.

2819
01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:19.590
It's impressive.

2820
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:20.580
Very impressive.

2821
01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:25.350
But now he's got tyrant so mad Tyron wants to fucking kill him.

2822
01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.620
That's a different person like Tyron has.

2823
01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:30.120
Cause he hates him.

2824
01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:32.340
It's all the shit talking Coby has been doing.

2825
01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:32.660
He did.

2826
01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:33.990
He did interviews with people.

2827
01:11:33.991 --> 01:11:36.210
We told them don't bring up Colbys name.

2828
01:11:36.211 --> 01:11:39.180
I don't want you to even bring up his name because he didn't want Colby getting

2829
01:11:39.181 --> 01:11:40.080
in any attention.

2830
01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:41.850
But now it's too late.

2831
01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:42.880
Now,

2832
01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.440
<v 3>Daryl doesn't want anyone's name other than his brought up all the time on any</v>

2833
01:11:47.441 --> 01:11:48.274
show ever.

2834
01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:49.421
Period.

2835
01:11:49.421 --> 01:11:50.254
Ever,

2836
01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:51.940
ever

2837
01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.890
<v 1>fight now he should be happy.</v>

2838
01:11:53.891 --> 01:11:56.200
That guy talks a lot of shit now cause that's what's gonna make them money.

2839
01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:57.093
You're right.

2840
01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.450
I mean good for both of them.

2841
01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.433
Fuck yeah,

2842
01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:00.413
go for it.

2843
01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:01.660
How do you feel about shit-talking?

2844
01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:02.450
Yeah,

2845
01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:05.540
<v 0>I was never ashamed of talking but because I never want to be that guy.</v>

2846
01:12:05.541 --> 01:12:07.010
That Shit Talk Shit.

2847
01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:08.023
Come back it up.

2848
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:10.860
So I like when people talk shit cause I'm a beat your ass anyway.

2849
01:12:11.210 --> 01:12:13.610
But you know it works for some.

2850
01:12:13.611 --> 01:12:14.444
It doesn't.

2851
01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:15.021
Like I said,

2852
01:12:15.021 --> 01:12:15.830
for me it was,

2853
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:17.030
I was never one of those guys.

2854
01:12:17.031 --> 01:12:20.930
But it has been one of those things that like you see every,

2855
01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:21.890
every couple of years,

2856
01:12:21.891 --> 01:12:26.870
it's those one guy that stands out from talking shit and it's like I had worked

2857
01:12:26.871 --> 01:12:27.704
for him.

2858
01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:27.910
They,

2859
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:30.080
you start to see everybody tried to trickle it,

2860
01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:30.880
<v 3>right.</v>

2861
01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.190
Well I think Connor did that for a lot of people.

2862
01:12:33.191 --> 01:12:35.230
But Colby saying some hilarious shit.

2863
01:12:35.231 --> 01:12:36.160
I'm gonna take this belt,

2864
01:12:36.190 --> 01:12:37.270
bring it to Donald Trump.

2865
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.010
Fucking,

2866
01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:43.360
it's fucking fun though,

2867
01:12:43.361 --> 01:12:43.900
man.

2868
01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:45.220
It's the same thing Sheldon.

2869
01:12:46.670 --> 01:12:48.030
It's obviously fun,

2870
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.760
like just,

2871
01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.780
that's obviously bullshit,

2872
01:12:49.781 --> 01:12:50.160
but it's,

2873
01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:50.921
it fucking works.

2874
01:12:50.921 --> 01:12:51.310
Yeah,

2875
01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:52.143
exactly.

2876
01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.530
But Chels still the bus make me go watch him talk about anything.

2877
01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.260
I just fucking like really like what?

2878
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:59.230
He's a smart dude.

2879
01:12:59.290 --> 01:13:00.470
It's really good little,

2880
01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:01.543
his uh,

2881
01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.930
Instagram videos that he does and it's called,

2882
01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:05.140
we were fucking great.

2883
01:13:05.690 --> 01:13:06.340
They're excellent.

2884
01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:07.173
Fucking great.

2885
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:10.870
I would take a class from jail on how to like talk shit.

2886
01:13:10.871 --> 01:13:11.500
Do that shit.

2887
01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.333
I would totally do it.

2888
01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:13.661
Yeah,

2889
01:13:13.661 --> 01:13:13.961
man.

2890
01:13:13.961 --> 01:13:15.640
When he was fighting Anderson Silva,

2891
01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:16.661
those,

2892
01:13:16.661 --> 01:13:18.310
those were the glory days of Shit.

2893
01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:19.210
Talking in MMA,

2894
01:13:19.211 --> 01:13:20.620
he opened up the door for everybody,

2895
01:13:20.621 --> 01:13:22.630
how they feed and the Nogueira brothers a carrot.

2896
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.920
That carrot a bus was a donkey.

2897
01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:29.890
I didn't know that they had the internet there.

2898
01:13:29.891 --> 01:13:30.431
I swear.

2899
01:13:30.431 --> 01:13:31.010
I didn't know.

2900
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:32.440
I thought it was on a private forum.

2901
01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:34.220
The Internet guys

2902
01:13:34.230 --> 01:13:34.860
<v 1>balls.</v>

2903
01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:37.650
He went over and did the ultimate fighter in Brazil.

2904
01:13:38.130 --> 01:13:38.371
I mean,

2905
01:13:38.371 --> 01:13:39.540
went over it to Brazil,

2906
01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:44.130
stayed there for six weeks and did the ultimate fighter and coached alongside

2907
01:13:44.131 --> 01:13:48.040
Vandelay and Vandelay got jumped by a DDA.

2908
01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:48.870
Yeah.

2909
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:53.580
And Vandelay got so goofy on the show that Vandelay loss Brazilian fans,

2910
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.630
cause Vandelia was coming after him and Cheo was trying to be calm about it.

2911
01:13:57.631 --> 01:13:58.201
And jails like,

2912
01:13:58.201 --> 01:13:58.980
look,

2913
01:13:58.980 --> 01:13:59.251
you know,

2914
01:13:59.251 --> 01:14:00.300
like don't touch me,

2915
01:14:00.301 --> 01:14:01.230
don't come near me.

2916
01:14:01.231 --> 01:14:01.730
And you know,

2917
01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:02.600
randomly comes near him.

2918
01:14:02.601 --> 01:14:03.271
He grabs him,

2919
01:14:03.271 --> 01:14:04.081
takes him down.

2920
01:14:04.081 --> 01:14:04.880
He's like,

2921
01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:05.550
what?

2922
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:10.550
It was so it was so interesting like watching him turn it all around and people

2923
01:14:11.561 --> 01:14:12.580
mad at Vandelay.

2924
01:14:13.150 --> 01:14:14.830
I mean the Brazilians are mad at February.

2925
01:14:14.831 --> 01:14:15.101
They'll like,

2926
01:14:15.101 --> 01:14:16.040
you're making us look bad.

2927
01:14:16.041 --> 01:14:16.874
Yeah.

2928
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:17.481
<v 0>Perfect.</v>

2929
01:14:17.481 --> 01:14:18.350
Plays a perfect,

2930
01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:20.023
perfect.

2931
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.361
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2932
01:14:20.361 --> 01:14:21.194
I mean there's a,

2933
01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:24.440
there's a time and a place for shit talking and this is the time and this is the

2934
01:14:24.441 --> 01:14:24.871
place.

2935
01:14:24.871 --> 01:14:25.250
Yeah.

2936
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:27.770
It just seems like to make money now,

2937
01:14:27.771 --> 01:14:27.991
it's,

2938
01:14:27.991 --> 01:14:29.510
it's such a wise move.

2939
01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:29.861
<v 5>I mean,</v>

2940
01:14:29.861 --> 01:14:31.430
it's sports entertainment at the end of the day,

2941
01:14:31.431 --> 01:14:33.980
regardless of what anybody wants to say or think about it.

2942
01:14:33.981 --> 01:14:35.570
And like I'd rather,

2943
01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:37.710
I mean I'd watch two guys that aren't that good if I,

2944
01:14:37.711 --> 01:14:37.941
you know,

2945
01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:39.290
like the tough man contest.

2946
01:14:39.291 --> 01:14:40.370
If it's marketed right,

2947
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:42.860
like the bouncers and bartenders,

2948
01:14:42.861 --> 01:14:43.311
like whatever,

2949
01:14:43.311 --> 01:14:44.144
like if it's entertaining,

2950
01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:45.053
<v 1>it's entertainment.</v>

2951
01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.970
Some of the best fights have been against guys who aren't some of the best

2952
01:14:47.971 --> 01:14:48.391
fighters.

2953
01:14:48.391 --> 01:14:48.991
Butter bean.

2954
01:14:48.991 --> 01:14:52.620
I'd love that guy was the best fights ever.

2955
01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:54.090
Sure.

2956
01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:57.220
I want to start like this fucking tough man contest promotions.

2957
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:59.220
Even good guys who aren't world champions.

2958
01:14:59.221 --> 01:15:00.960
Like when a Toro Gotti fought Micky ward,

2959
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:04.260
we knew that they were both perfectly matched and they would just going to

2960
01:15:04.261 --> 01:15:07.410
collide in the middle of the ring and beat the fuck out of each other.

2961
01:15:07.411 --> 01:15:10.050
But there's just some of the classic boxing matches

2962
01:15:11.530 --> 01:15:12.363
<v 0>for sure.</v>

2963
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:15.400
<v 5>Didn't have to be for the heavyweight championship.</v>

2964
01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:16.140
<v 1>No,</v>

2965
01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:16.650
no,

2966
01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:17.483
no.

2967
01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.800
I mean there's some been some amazing fights in the UFC.

2968
01:15:19.801 --> 01:15:20.491
There's similar to that,

2969
01:15:20.491 --> 01:15:22.470
like Gilbert Melendez versus Diego Sanchez.

2970
01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:22.800
Right.

2971
01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:23.670
That wasn't for a title.

2972
01:15:23.671 --> 01:15:24.970
I was one of the greatest fights of RC.

2973
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:26.040
That shit was crazy.

2974
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:28.380
<v 0>The whole classic style makes bikes.</v>

2975
01:15:28.381 --> 01:15:28.651
I mean,

2976
01:15:28.651 --> 01:15:31.230
I've always liked the shifts.

2977
01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:35.850
Two fighters that don't really have too much online and talking shit about a

2978
01:15:35.851 --> 01:15:37.410
fight hype.

2979
01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.810
The hype behind the fight is what makes,

2980
01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:41.343
you know.

2981
01:15:41.490 --> 01:15:41.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2982
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:43.680
As long as you can actually still fight.

2983
01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:48.050
And that's what makes it interesting with the guy like Conor or a guy like Colby

2984
01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:49.290
day can fucking fight.

2985
01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.370
They're talking a lot of shit.

2986
01:15:50.371 --> 01:15:50.941
But when and when?

2987
01:15:50.941 --> 01:15:51.300
The,

2988
01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:52.290
when the bell rings,

2989
01:15:52.291 --> 01:15:53.190
they're backing it up.

2990
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.760
<v 5>I mean,</v>

2991
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.700
we were talking about this earlier,

2992
01:15:54.701 --> 01:15:57.790
but that's what bugs me the most about cm punk was the,

2993
01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:58.780
he has the,

2994
01:15:59.320 --> 01:15:59.771
the,

2995
01:15:59.771 --> 01:16:00.130
uh,

2996
01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:01.630
WWE back on,

2997
01:16:01.631 --> 01:16:03.940
you would think you'd be least be like great on the mic.

2998
01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:04.481
You know what I mean?

2999
01:16:04.481 --> 01:16:04.781
And they're like,

3000
01:16:04.781 --> 01:16:06.210
maybe we can't back it up or fight or whatever.

3001
01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:06.970
But like,

3002
01:16:06.970 --> 01:16:08.860
he goes from like cocky and confident,

3003
01:16:08.861 --> 01:16:11.560
I'm the fuck a jab or whatever that we're going to be easy to like,

3004
01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:12.090
ah,

3005
01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:12.310
you know,

3006
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:13.420
I just believe in yourself.

3007
01:16:13.421 --> 01:16:13.781
Kids.

3008
01:16:13.781 --> 01:16:14.614
Like,

3009
01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:15.670
it's like really hard to,

3010
01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:18.820
I don't believe anything has no physical,

3011
01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:20.260
like no physique.

3012
01:16:20.261 --> 01:16:21.710
He doesn't at least not like it's a,

3013
01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:22.553
it's Kinda sad.

3014
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:24.040
[inaudible] I just shit on cm punk.

3015
01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:24.611
<v 1>No,</v>

3016
01:16:24.611 --> 01:16:25.001
listen,

3017
01:16:25.001 --> 01:16:25.834
you didn't shit on them.

3018
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:27.460
You were honest about them.

3019
01:16:27.461 --> 01:16:28.810
You were honest about what you saw.

3020
01:16:28.811 --> 01:16:30.010
I don't think that shitting on him.

3021
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.903
Right.

3022
01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:32.380
He's a very nice guy.

3023
01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.300
He's a very nice guy and he's a hard worker,

3024
01:16:34.301 --> 01:16:36.610
but he does not have athletic talent.

3025
01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.260
He's missing a lot.

3026
01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:39.580
And he's a showman.

3027
01:16:39.581 --> 01:16:41.050
And when he was in the WWE,

3028
01:16:41.051 --> 01:16:42.170
he was allowed to say hi,

3029
01:16:42.171 --> 01:16:43.140
I'm the fucking man.

3030
01:16:43.141 --> 01:16:44.260
Marriner throw his arms up there.

3031
01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:46.420
And they had it scripted so that he was the man.

3032
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:51.870
But you know when you're in there with a guy like Mike Jackson who had zero fear

3033
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:57.820
of him and just was so casual and just popping them in the face anytime you

3034
01:16:57.821 --> 01:17:00.550
wanted to and literally can stop them anytime.

3035
01:17:00.551 --> 01:17:02.610
If he just got angry and want to stop him,

3036
01:17:02.611 --> 01:17:04.180
he could have stopped him at any point in the fight.

3037
01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:07.360
And even though he beat him decisively,

3038
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.220
the performance was Ipis Dana white off so bad

3039
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:12.680
<v 4>the way he was fighting that he called him a fucking idiot.</v>

3040
01:17:12.681 --> 01:17:12.981
And he said,

3041
01:17:12.981 --> 01:17:14.240
I'll never fight in the UFC again.

3042
01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:15.253
And he won.

3043
01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:20.300
So like if Mike Jackson went out there and just start cm punk with a right hand

3044
01:17:20.301 --> 01:17:21.470
left hook combination,

3045
01:17:21.471 --> 01:17:22.520
and that was the end of it,

3046
01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:23.121
they would say,

3047
01:17:23.121 --> 01:17:24.080
well cm punk,

3048
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:24.950
you gave it a shot.

3049
01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:25.461
That's it.

3050
01:17:25.461 --> 01:17:26.150
It's over.

3051
01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:26.680
Mike,

3052
01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:27.770
who would you like to fight next?

3053
01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:29.030
And now it's like,

3054
01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:29.631
you know,

3055
01:17:29.631 --> 01:17:32.330
you're not even fighting in the UFC anymore because you should've,

3056
01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.340
you should've stopped him like what you were doing.

3057
01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:35.203
He tickled them.

3058
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:36.430
You fucking tickled to them.

3059
01:17:36.690 --> 01:17:39.230
I'll make a joke of the sport like it's already like a joke.

3060
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:40.051
If this guy,

3061
01:17:40.051 --> 01:17:40.210
you know,

3062
01:17:40.210 --> 01:17:41.990
everyone thinks cm funks like fucking joke.

3063
01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:43.130
I guess he is.

3064
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.963
If that's the way they look,

3065
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:47.240
but like don't make a joke of the sport and like not know.

3066
01:17:47.850 --> 01:17:50.130
They kind of just like poke in front of the fence.

3067
01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:51.560
I get worthiness coming from,

3068
01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:51.891
I get,

3069
01:17:51.891 --> 01:17:52.221
we're doing this.

3070
01:17:52.221 --> 01:17:52.451
Come on.

3071
01:17:52.451 --> 01:17:52.721
It's too,

3072
01:17:52.721 --> 01:17:53.554
I'd a starched him.

3073
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:54.140
Yeah,

3074
01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:55.730
it's the whole thing was,

3075
01:17:56.150 --> 01:17:57.050
it was very weird.

3076
01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.070
The whole thing was very weird.

3077
01:17:58.310 --> 01:18:00.920
It was like right away when you see cm punk holding,

3078
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:03.910
holding his hands up and moving stiff and throwing kicks like,

3079
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:05.210
oh Jesus.

3080
01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.760
Like I don't like that being on paper view.

3081
01:18:07.761 --> 01:18:08.590
I understand that they,

3082
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:10.010
they're selling paper view cards,

3083
01:18:10.011 --> 01:18:13.070
but paper view in the UFC should be the elite fighters.

3084
01:18:13.071 --> 01:18:17.300
Curtis blades versus Alistair Overeem should have been on that paper view card.

3085
01:18:17.301 --> 01:18:18.350
That's what should have been there.

3086
01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:19.071
Not,

3087
01:18:19.071 --> 01:18:20.210
not what we got to see.

3088
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:22.310
You know what we got to see was just,

3089
01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:24.253
yeah,

3090
01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:26.060
I like when it's like,

3091
01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:28.280
like you're playing a trick on the fence,

3092
01:18:28.281 --> 01:18:28.810
you know what I mean?

3093
01:18:28.810 --> 01:18:32.030
He promoting this guy if you something and then it's like sparring videos come

3094
01:18:32.031 --> 01:18:32.571
out and it's like,

3095
01:18:32.571 --> 01:18:33.650
what the fuck is this?

3096
01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:35.120
Sparring videos are crazy.

3097
01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:35.931
Awful.

3098
01:18:35.931 --> 01:18:37.880
It was like a guy who just showed how to spar.

3099
01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:38.570
Awful.

3100
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:41.570
It's like you took a dude who's no wrestling background,

3101
01:18:41.571 --> 01:18:42.404
no nothing.

3102
01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.030
Or this one I want you to do,

3103
01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.230
this is a jab.

3104
01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:47.810
This is the right hand and this is when you throw a kick.

3105
01:18:47.811 --> 01:18:48.830
I want you to pivot your hips.

3106
01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:49.820
Go ahead in there as spar.

3107
01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:51.560
I mean he just,

3108
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.170
he doesn't have the ability to move his body.

3109
01:18:54.171 --> 01:18:54.770
Right.

3110
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:56.720
There's a lot of guys you could take out there that are,

3111
01:18:56.721 --> 01:18:57.220
um,

3112
01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:02.220
track and field guys or football players and you could get them to fight better

3113
01:19:02.331 --> 01:19:04.150
than him and a couple of weeks right.

3114
01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:05.870
Easily because they're athletes,

3115
01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:06.973
they're athletes.

3116
01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:09.170
They would understand how to shift their weight,

3117
01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:09.951
throw a punch,

3118
01:19:09.951 --> 01:19:11.140
and yeah,

3119
01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:11.720
the,

3120
01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:13.610
the sparring videos that I saw was,

3121
01:19:13.650 --> 01:19:15.650
I think it was from his first fight,

3122
01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:16.161
but even then,

3123
01:19:16.161 --> 01:19:16.821
like he wasn't,

3124
01:19:16.821 --> 01:19:19.350
he signed for like two years before he had his first fight or something like

3125
01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:20.290
that.

3126
01:19:20.290 --> 01:19:24.350
There's no way that you're six years deep in the game and yet he's still at that

3127
01:19:24.351 --> 01:19:24.980
bad.

3128
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:25.670
You know what I mean?

3129
01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:26.750
It doesn't have any talent.

3130
01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:27.741
That's all it is.

3131
01:19:27.741 --> 01:19:31.160
It just doesn't have physical talent or whatever for whatever reason,

3132
01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:31.961
whether it's a,

3133
01:19:31.961 --> 01:19:32.390
he,

3134
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:33.290
his approach,

3135
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:34.490
his intensity,

3136
01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:35.490
whether it's,

3137
01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:37.010
it's not as coaching.

3138
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:38.630
He said Duke fucking Rufus,

3139
01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.640
you know,

3140
01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:40.350
I mean,

3141
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:43.790
I have a house with Cushman that he talks about two groups and one of the put

3142
01:19:43.791 --> 01:19:44.361
pre fights.

3143
01:19:44.361 --> 01:19:44.751
He said,

3144
01:19:44.751 --> 01:19:45.584
uh,

3145
01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.760
how do you see this fight?

3146
01:19:46.761 --> 01:19:47.001
He's like,

3147
01:19:47.001 --> 01:19:47.091
oh,

3148
01:19:47.091 --> 01:19:48.300
I really like a head kick to,

3149
01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:49.400
I'd love to see a head kick.

3150
01:19:49.401 --> 01:19:50.000
And like,

3151
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.140
I don't think that's going to happen.

3152
01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:51.501
Oh,

3153
01:19:51.501 --> 01:19:52.334
that's so crazy.

3154
01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:53.860
That,

3155
01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:55.310
so that's such a crazy thing to say.

3156
01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:56.300
Um,

3157
01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:56.571
you know,

3158
01:19:56.571 --> 01:19:57.800
Duke's a beautiful person.

3159
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:58.260
He's a,

3160
01:19:58.260 --> 01:19:59.780
he's a great guy in every,

3161
01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:01.790
every sense of the word.

3162
01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:02.660
He just is,

3163
01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:03.493
he's a great guy.

3164
01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:04.790
He did his best.

3165
01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:05.240
You know,

3166
01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.290
there's only so much you could do,

3167
01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.313
you know,

3168
01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:07.861
I mean,

3169
01:20:07.861 --> 01:20:08.160
I'm sure

3170
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.300
<v 1>you would love working with Duke.</v>

3171
01:20:09.301 --> 01:20:12.180
I'm sure he would love working with you if you and Duke work together.

3172
01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:15.870
I'm sure you guys would have a great old time because you're Joe fucking

3173
01:20:15.871 --> 01:20:16.351
shillings,

3174
01:20:16.351 --> 01:20:16.650
right?

3175
01:20:16.650 --> 01:20:17.940
And he's Duke fucking relevance,

3176
01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:18.660
you know,

3177
01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:19.493
let them know.

3178
01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:21.451
But you know what I mean?

3179
01:20:21.451 --> 01:20:21.601
I mean,

3180
01:20:21.601 --> 01:20:23.190
you have to have something to work with,

3181
01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:23.881
you know,

3182
01:20:23.881 --> 01:20:24.330
I mean,

3183
01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:29.130
if Duke just grabbed some dude from a gas station that has been,

3184
01:20:29.131 --> 01:20:29.760
uh,

3185
01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:33.390
drinking beer and smoking cigarettes his whole life and had him in a fight in

3186
01:20:33.391 --> 01:20:34.224
six months,

3187
01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.240
how much can you pause?

3188
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:39.660
<v 3>But I would rather see that fight against these other ones.</v>

3189
01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:41.370
Let's find out how that one would go.

3190
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:41.971
Well,

3191
01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:42.241
a guy,

3192
01:20:42.241 --> 01:20:44.010
you can find it a gas station Berens there.

3193
01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.310
<v 1>What's interesting is they both,</v>

3194
01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.290
both guys fought Mickey Golf first.

3195
01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:48.100
Just weird.

3196
01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.510
Did you see his Instagram?

3197
01:20:49.690 --> 01:20:50.141
Mickey's,

3198
01:20:50.141 --> 01:20:50.381
yeah,

3199
01:20:50.381 --> 01:20:52.090
he did like his own pre fight.

3200
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.943
Uh,

3201
01:20:53.190 --> 01:20:55.120
what do you analysis of how it was going to go?

3202
01:20:55.121 --> 01:20:55.940
It was really good.

3203
01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:56.773
Yeah.

3204
01:20:58.010 --> 01:20:58.843
Um,

3205
01:20:59.020 --> 01:20:59.470
you know,

3206
01:20:59.470 --> 01:21:03.580
that was a disaster when I saw Mickey fight and then I saw that it was going to

3207
01:21:03.581 --> 01:21:04.930
fight cm punk.

3208
01:21:04.931 --> 01:21:05.764
I was like,

3209
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:07.180
who said Yes to this?

3210
01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.130
Why the fuck would you say yes to this?

3211
01:21:09.131 --> 01:21:11.650
This is 100% guaranteed brain damage.

3212
01:21:11.651 --> 01:21:13.120
There's no way you're going to beat him.

3213
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.661
There's not,

3214
01:21:13.661 --> 01:21:15.790
you don't have a goddamn chance in hell.

3215
01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.110
You have no chance.

3216
01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:18.880
And I was saying that people get mad at me.

3217
01:21:18.881 --> 01:21:20.260
The CM punk fans get mad at me.

3218
01:21:20.261 --> 01:21:20.471
I'm like,

3219
01:21:20.471 --> 01:21:20.980
look,

3220
01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:21.820
this is what I do.

3221
01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:23.590
My job is to analyze shit.

3222
01:21:23.591 --> 01:21:23.960
I look,

3223
01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:24.820
I look at fighters,

3224
01:21:24.821 --> 01:21:25.290
I look at me,

3225
01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:26.950
I understand what I'm talking about,

3226
01:21:26.951 --> 01:21:27.400
man.

3227
01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:28.120
This is like,

3228
01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:28.450
I'm good.

3229
01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:31.690
I got a pit bull and I'm going to put them in a cage with a puppy.

3230
01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:33.130
What do you think's going to happen?

3231
01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:34.540
The pit bull is going to kill the puppy.

3232
01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:35.591
This is what,

3233
01:21:35.591 --> 01:21:36.820
this is how it works.

3234
01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.140
This isn't like,

3235
01:21:38.141 --> 01:21:40.180
this isn't like maybe that puppy going to grab him by the face.

3236
01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:40.521
No,

3237
01:21:40.521 --> 01:21:40.601
no,

3238
01:21:40.601 --> 01:21:41.020
no,

3239
01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:41.171
no,

3240
01:21:41.171 --> 01:21:41.261
no,

3241
01:21:41.261 --> 01:21:41.680
no.

3242
01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:42.513
Listen to me.

3243
01:21:42.730 --> 01:21:43.563
I'm telling you,

3244
01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:45.580
this is how bad this matchup is.

3245
01:21:45.581 --> 01:21:46.240
This is uh,

3246
01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:50.440
this is a Brazilian jujitsu brown belt with a nasty back game.

3247
01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:52.510
It was strong and fast.

3248
01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:53.641
<v 3>You look at,</v>

3249
01:21:53.641 --> 01:21:54.150
uh,

3250
01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:56.070
the matchup with a cm punk.

3251
01:21:56.071 --> 01:21:59.740
Just had Mike Jackson Mickey and beat my checks in and I'm like under a minute

3252
01:21:59.770 --> 01:22:01.410
and smashed him.

3253
01:22:01.411 --> 01:22:01.981
Took his back,

3254
01:22:01.981 --> 01:22:02.461
strangle him.

3255
01:22:02.461 --> 01:22:03.420
He said he's a bit,

3256
01:22:03.421 --> 01:22:06.260
I hear training with me for like the three months now and the kids getting

3257
01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:06.781
really good.

3258
01:22:06.781 --> 01:22:08.130
His striking is getting really,

3259
01:22:08.131 --> 01:22:08.790
really good.

3260
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:09.750
He's fucking talented.

3261
01:22:09.751 --> 01:22:09.960
Matt.

3262
01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:10.560
Really good.

3263
01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.940
And he talks a lot of shit too.

3264
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:12.211
Yeah,

3265
01:22:12.211 --> 01:22:12.720
he's good.

3266
01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.940
Plus has got hilarious walk out music when it comes out that,

3267
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:15.281
oh,

3268
01:22:15.281 --> 01:22:19.590
Mickey yesterday tried to convince him ever since he got here,

3269
01:22:19.591 --> 01:22:20.700
I called his phone and it's like,

3270
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:23.400
you know those people that have this ring back songs and they're like fucking

3271
01:22:23.401 --> 01:22:24.140
horrible.

3272
01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:24.230
Yeah.

3273
01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:25.063
Elevator music.

3274
01:22:25.450 --> 01:22:26.790
And he answers and I'm like,

3275
01:22:26.791 --> 01:22:27.061
dude,

3276
01:22:27.061 --> 01:22:28.350
turn that fucking shit off.

3277
01:22:28.351 --> 01:22:30.210
He'd change it or at least have it be.

3278
01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:30.751
Hey Mickey,

3279
01:22:30.751 --> 01:22:31.400
you're so fine.

3280
01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:31.980
Yeah.

3281
01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:34.500
What is his music that he had them on some trash.

3282
01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:35.363
It's an

3283
01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:37.920
elevator.

3284
01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:40.800
Like something off.

3285
01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:42.480
Fucking change it.

3286
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:43.210
Mickey,

3287
01:22:43.210 --> 01:22:44.043
Change Your Buddy.

3288
01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:46.710
When is he fighting again?

3289
01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:48.070
Uh,

3290
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:49.740
I don't think it has anything booked yet.

3291
01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:50.280
We're a,

3292
01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.080
I think he's,

3293
01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:51.913
he's calling Sean.

3294
01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:52.763
Sean Shelby.

3295
01:22:52.890 --> 01:22:54.240
So he's working with you with this tracking?

3296
01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:54.890
Yup.

3297
01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:55.260
Nine.

3298
01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:55.690
No,

3299
01:22:55.690 --> 01:22:56.790
he's helped me with my ground game.

3300
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:57.870
And who is he working with?

3301
01:22:57.871 --> 01:22:58.800
His ground game out here?

3302
01:22:59.390 --> 01:23:00.070
Uh,

3303
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.510
uh,

3304
01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:01.950
Jason Manly and uh,

3305
01:23:02.130 --> 01:23:04.020
Bomba fast come solace.

3306
01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:04.990
Where's that?

3307
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:06.190
Out of a Bama

3308
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.250
<v 4>trades of me and Jason Manly is a,</v>

3309
01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:09.610

3310
01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:10.661
That's cool.

3311
01:23:10.661 --> 01:23:11.680
So where is he a,

3312
01:23:11.681 --> 01:23:13.180
is he staying at Burbank out there?

3313
01:23:13.181 --> 01:23:13.721
Is He staying there?

3314
01:23:13.721 --> 01:23:14.060
You,

3315
01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:14.950

3316
01:23:14.951 --> 01:23:16.090

Eagle Rock.

3319
01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:18.911
Nice.

3320
01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:20.560
She's actually roommates with Eve Edwards.

3321
01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:21.551
No Shit.

3322
01:23:21.551 --> 01:23:22.150
Yeah.

3323
01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:22.451
Oh,

3324
01:23:22.451 --> 01:23:24.070
that's right here.

3325
01:23:24.071 --> 01:23:27.970
We got me to live for getting this little little love eve getting this dude.

3326
01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:28.923
They didn't go on.

3327
01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:29.140
Yeah,

3328
01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:29.381
man.

3329
01:23:29.381 --> 01:23:30.130
He's great isn't he?

3330
01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:31.000
He's a great dude.

3331
01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:31.983
He's a great dude.

3332
01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.790
He's a very good on the desk too.

3333
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.820
It's interesting to see like a former fighters on the desk.

3334
01:23:36.821 --> 01:23:39.340
Like some dudes are loss and some dudes are smooth.

3335
01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:40.031
You know,

3336
01:23:40.031 --> 01:23:41.410
some things are very good at it.

3337
01:23:41.670 --> 01:23:41.950
He's,

3338
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:42.790
I think he's as great.

3339
01:23:42.791 --> 01:23:42.941
Right?

3340
01:23:42.941 --> 01:23:43.774
It's very good.

3341
01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:45.640
I think he's one of my favorite ones to watch.

3342
01:23:45.670 --> 01:23:45.911
Yeah.

3343
01:23:45.911 --> 01:23:49.230
I tweeted about it up like years ago when he first started doing it.

3344
01:23:49.230 --> 01:23:49.731
I'm like die.

3345
01:23:49.731 --> 01:23:51.040
I really appreciate him doing that.

3346
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:51.840
You know?

3347
01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:52.330
Um,

3348
01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:53.920
Michael Bisping is very good at it too.

3349
01:23:54.190 --> 01:23:56.110
Although his Colby got out,

3350
01:23:56.111 --> 01:23:57.130
it was a little awkward.

3351
01:23:57.730 --> 01:23:59.410
They went after it after the,

3352
01:23:59.411 --> 01:24:00.010
uh,

3353
01:24:00.010 --> 01:24:00.843
after the fight.

3354
01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:02.980
Like Bisbing can't not talk shit.

3355
01:24:02.981 --> 01:24:03.814
Right.

3356
01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:05.090
He can't help himself,

3357
01:24:05.091 --> 01:24:05.711
which I kinda,

3358
01:24:05.711 --> 01:24:06.041
I kinda,

3359
01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:07.810
I really appreciate that about and actually,

3360
01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.740
well he's,

3361
01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:09.760
he's a dog man.

3362
01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:10.241
His,

3363
01:24:10.241 --> 01:24:12.850
his competitive drive is pretty intense.

3364
01:24:12.851 --> 01:24:13.091
You know,

3365
01:24:13.091 --> 01:24:15.490
Bisping is in my opinion like one of the best,

3366
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:18.820
but he's like one of the best poster boys for just hard work,

3367
01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:23.470
mental toughness and determination and also being that like British dude at the

3368
01:24:23.471 --> 01:24:27.990
bar that are like have a beer and tell you to go fuck herself and piss off

3369
01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:29.173
mother.

3370
01:24:31.190 --> 01:24:32.023
Yeah.

3371
01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:32.470
Yeah.

3372
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:33.303
That's good.

3373
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.430
He's got problems with his other eye now too.

3374
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:35.811
It does.

3375
01:24:35.811 --> 01:24:36.260
He,

3376
01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:37.093
yeah.

3377
01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:39.700
You got some sort of a detachment and his other eye is good.

3378
01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:42.940
I thought they were going to fix fixed one.

3379
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:45.610
I thought it was like going to get better or something.

3380
01:24:45.611 --> 01:24:46.460
Well they would get it done.

3381
01:24:46.570 --> 01:24:51.570
He's got some sort of oil in it that protects it before he retires and then when

3382
01:24:51.641 --> 01:24:53.950
he retires he's going to get it operated on to fix it.

3383
01:24:53.951 --> 01:24:56.170
But now he has a new problem with his right eye.

3384
01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:59.740
He was seeing some flash or something like that and his right eye and he went to

3385
01:24:59.741 --> 01:25:02.590
the doctor and found out it's got of detachment there and he's like,

3386
01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:02.981
all right,

3387
01:25:02.981 --> 01:25:03.580
fuck this.

3388
01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:04.050
I'm done.

3389
01:25:04.050 --> 01:25:05.320
Cause he was going to have one more fight.

3390
01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:05.980
Yeah.

3391
01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:06.521
And now he's like,

3392
01:25:06.521 --> 01:25:07.210
I'm done.

3393
01:25:07.210 --> 01:25:08.320
He did it all man.

3394
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:08.560
Yeah.

3395
01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.820
He won the ultimate fighter.

3396
01:25:09.821 --> 01:25:10.870
He won the title,

3397
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.910
you know,

3398
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:13.400
in Haiti and,

3399
01:25:13.530 --> 01:25:14.050
and now he's,

3400
01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:17.980
he's a good analyst to go to the desk cause she think go on his podcasts.

3401
01:25:17.981 --> 01:25:18.940
I think you're great too.

3402
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.233
He's doing good.

3403
01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:22.820
That is a nice thing to yep.

3404
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:24.040
Get some movies.

3405
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.221
Yeah.

3406
01:25:24.221 --> 01:25:25.270
He's always got something going on.

3407
01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:26.200
Um,

3408
01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.480
it's nice that guys do have those other options too,

3409
01:25:28.481 --> 01:25:30.190
like podcasts and different things.

3410
01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:30.701
Now there's,

3411
01:25:30.701 --> 01:25:31.600
there's ways out,

3412
01:25:31.601 --> 01:25:32.400
you know,

3413
01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.180
especially you look at like what's Shobbs done.

3414
01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:38.790
Shop has taken it to a whole nother level as far as guys being able to get out

3415
01:25:38.791 --> 01:25:39.340
of the,

3416
01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:42.380
out of the fight game and then make a living as a podcast.

3417
01:25:42.381 --> 01:25:46.300
And he's fucking doing stand up now and headlining clubs and shit and traveling

3418
01:25:46.301 --> 01:25:46.871
all over the country.

3419
01:25:46.871 --> 01:25:47.740
And He's good man.

3420
01:25:47.741 --> 01:25:48.551
He's fucking funny.

3421
01:25:48.551 --> 01:25:49.600
He's a funny dude.

3422
01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:50.230
Yeah,

3423
01:25:50.230 --> 01:25:51.100
it's hilarious.

3424
01:25:51.130 --> 01:25:51.963
You know,

3425
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.350
it's just nice that fighters have options because you know,

3426
01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.810
seeing the guy stick around when he shouldn't be doing it anymore.

3427
01:25:58.811 --> 01:26:00.520
It's one of the hardest things for sure.

3428
01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:03.830
And then he looked like all the NFL guys or any pro sport of these guys are

3429
01:26:03.831 --> 01:26:06.920
broke by the end up with him like four years of when they finish.

3430
01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:08.413
And uh,

3431
01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:08.541
yeah,

3432
01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:10.790
there's not a whole lot of other options for a lot of the guys.

3433
01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:12.470
So I think it's good.

3434
01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:15.260
It's nice that we have other options for sure.

3435
01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:16.820
So would you sign it?

3436
01:26:16.821 --> 01:26:18.400
You showed everybody the way your job,

3437
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:19.423
there's a way,

3438
01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.270
you know,

3439
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:21.103
there's a way,

3440
01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:22.750
there's ways now,

3441
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:24.320
especially with the Internet man,

3442
01:26:24.321 --> 01:26:26.090
there's just crazy ways.

3443
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.721
I mean,

3444
01:26:26.721 --> 01:26:31.280
how much money think mighty mouse makes on his twitch stream would say a decent

3445
01:26:31.281 --> 01:26:31.521
amount.

3446
01:26:31.521 --> 01:26:36.320
I don't know how much this is like the video game dudes twitch stream and they

3447
01:26:36.321 --> 01:26:40.100
not even like the best gamers in the world and they make thousands and thousands

3448
01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:41.900
of dollars and would write pages on there all the time.

3449
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:43.480
Would you say something right now?

3450
01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:43.790
Sugar.

3451
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:44.670
Sean's in it too.

3452
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:47.541
Not that I'm going to watch it,

3453
01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:47.711
but yeah,

3454
01:26:47.711 --> 01:26:49.220
it's on rampage does that too?

3455
01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:49.881
I think so.

3456
01:26:49.881 --> 01:26:50.061
Yeah.

3457
01:26:50.061 --> 01:26:50.800
He's like a big camera.

3458
01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.610
He's always talking about is he still active?

3459
01:26:52.670 --> 01:26:53.780
Is he still gonna fight again?

3460
01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:54.180
Yeah.

3461
01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:56.990
I was trying to get a fight with him not too long ago and uh,

3462
01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:58.383
I'm not sure what,

3463
01:26:58.670 --> 01:27:00.740
he's like 290 pounds right now.

3464
01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:04.980
<v 5>I feel like I still like figuring it that for that size.</v>

3465
01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:05.700
I could do that.

3466
01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:05.941
I'd be like,

3467
01:27:05.941 --> 01:27:06.774
you could do that.

3468
01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:07.770
That could be and pitch.

3469
01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:09.950
I don't know if I'd go for like Brock Lesnar.

3470
01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:10.410
Okay,

3471
01:27:10.410 --> 01:27:11.440
<v 4>well the rental,</v>

3472
01:27:11.441 --> 01:27:12.131
we'll cut it anyway.

3473
01:27:12.131 --> 01:27:13.800
We're talking about fee because he doesn't,

3474
01:27:13.890 --> 01:27:15.240
he doesn't try to take you down.

3475
01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:15.720
Right.

3476
01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:17.220
Most likely he's going to try to stand with you,

3477
01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:18.083
right?

3478
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:19.050
Yeah.

3479
01:27:19.050 --> 01:27:22.860
Do you have a set schedule for when you returned to MMA?

3480
01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:23.993
<v 5>Uh,</v>

3481
01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:25.550
I'm hopefully getting,

3482
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:26.970
get something around September,

3483
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:27.421
August,

3484
01:27:27.421 --> 01:27:28.170
late August,

3485
01:27:28.170 --> 01:27:28.921
early September,

3486
01:27:28.921 --> 01:27:29.400
I think.

3487
01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:32.760
<v 4>And you just decided that we're kickboxing is right now,</v>

3488
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:34.350
just doesn't have enough juice.

3489
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:35.201
<v 5>Uh,</v>

3490
01:27:35.201 --> 01:27:35.650
yeah,

3491
01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:35.920
I,

3492
01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:36.310
uh,

3493
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.491
you know,

3494
01:27:36.491 --> 01:27:40.480
I want to keep us progressing financially and uh,

3495
01:27:40.570 --> 01:27:41.050
you know,

3496
01:27:41.050 --> 01:27:41.440
uh,

3497
01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:41.801
like I said,

3498
01:27:41.801 --> 01:27:43.600
money motivates me a lot and uh,

3499
01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:46.690
if I've reached the ceiling of the sport so to speak,

3500
01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:48.243
and there's,

3501
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:49.030
Oh,

3502
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.870
I'm amazed right here,

3503
01:27:49.871 --> 01:27:51.550
right next door and uh,

3504
01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:53.073
yeah,

3505
01:27:53.690 --> 01:27:54.430
that makes sense.

3506
01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:54.740
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3507
01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:55.230
No,

3508
01:27:55.230 --> 01:27:56.063
it does.

3509
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.940
Yeah.

3510
01:27:58.940 --> 01:27:59.211
I mean,

3511
01:27:59.211 --> 01:28:00.770
how many more years you think you've got to do it?

3512
01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:02.273
<v 5>Uh,</v>

3513
01:28:03.150 --> 01:28:03.690
four,

3514
01:28:03.690 --> 01:28:04.260
five,

3515
01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:04.471
four,

3516
01:28:04.471 --> 01:28:04.970
five.

3517
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:05.310
Yeah.

3518
01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:05.790
Yeah.

3519
01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:08.490
I want to make big fights as much money as I can.

3520
01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:09.810
Um,

3521
01:28:09.810 --> 01:28:11.040
and set up for,

3522
01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:12.060
you know,

3523
01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:13.080
life after fighting.

3524
01:28:13.081 --> 01:28:13.501
I think,

3525
01:28:13.501 --> 01:28:13.710
you know,

3526
01:28:13.710 --> 01:28:14.543
you can't just quit.

3527
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.791
Right.

3528
01:28:14.791 --> 01:28:18.420
You got to find ways to market yourself to the highest level,

3529
01:28:18.421 --> 01:28:20.070
to give as much attention as possible.

3530
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:22.350
So the irrelevant in the space that you pass.

3531
01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:25.500
And I just don't think that kickboxing is going to get me there,

3532
01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:26.570
you know?

3533
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:27.081
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3534
01:28:27.081 --> 01:28:27.740
Man,

3535
01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:28.371
it's a bummer.

3536
01:28:28.371 --> 01:28:29.240
But I think you're right.

3537
01:28:29.241 --> 01:28:30.050
I think it's a smart,

3538
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:32.000
if you're just dealing with strictly financially,

3539
01:28:32.001 --> 01:28:33.230
I think it's a very smart move.

3540
01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:34.670
It's very unfortunate.

3541
01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:36.350
I really wished there was a solution.

3542
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:37.850
I do not know what it would be though.

3543
01:28:37.851 --> 01:28:38.061
I mean,

3544
01:28:38.061 --> 01:28:38.811
everybody's tried.

3545
01:28:38.811 --> 01:28:39.920
Spike TV tried.

3546
01:28:39.970 --> 01:28:41.930
They tried with the paramount network.

3547
01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:42.051
A,

3548
01:28:42.051 --> 01:28:43.220
they tried with glory,

3549
01:28:43.530 --> 01:28:44.200
you know.

3550
01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.010
<v 5>Well I think it also with pellets tore it.</v>

3551
01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:46.873
You know,

3552
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:48.470
maybe I'll come back new.

3553
01:28:48.471 --> 01:28:49.281
There's a big fight,

3554
01:28:49.281 --> 01:28:49.491
you know,

3555
01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:51.230
maybe Musashi's like,

3556
01:28:51.231 --> 01:28:54.290
you know what I think I want the bells were kickboxing entitled to be

3557
01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:55.090
<v 4>right.</v>

3558
01:28:55.090 --> 01:28:55.570
Yeah,

3559
01:28:55.570 --> 01:28:56.141
let's do it.

3560
01:28:56.141 --> 01:28:56.974
So,

3561
01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:57.740
yeah.

3562
01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:58.190
<v 5>Um,</v>

3563
01:28:58.190 --> 01:28:59.510
but I would fight if they let me,

3564
01:28:59.511 --> 01:29:01.950
I would fight fucking kickboxing first,

3565
01:29:01.951 --> 01:29:02.130
win

3566
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:04.600
<v 3>that fight and then come back out the same night and fight him a man.</v>

3567
01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:05.490
Really?

3568
01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:06.323
Hell yeah.

3569
01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:08.483
I brought it up.

3570
01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:12.810
I brought it up to coker at a a meeting not too long ago where they say,

3571
01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:13.800
they just kind of looked at me like,

3572
01:29:14.410 --> 01:29:15.243
ah,

3573
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:19.560
the same way they looked at me when I said I would have to fight rampage of

3574
01:29:19.561 --> 01:29:20.360
Vandelay.

3575
01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:20.950
Ah,

3576
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:21.270
yeah.

3577
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:25.110
Well his deal is he back like what's going on with Vandelay?

3578
01:29:25.170 --> 01:29:26.003
I don't know.

3579
01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:29.520
I just saw it as a an opportunity when shale beat him,

3580
01:29:29.850 --> 01:29:30.990
you know his complaint was it,

3581
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:31.620
you know,

3582
01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:33.140
he just took a bath and laid on top of them.

3583
01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.730
It's just been kind of my complaint for a while so I figured,

3584
01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:37.580
but they don't want that fine.

3585
01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:38.653
Yup.

3586
01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:39.970
Why don't they want that?

3587
01:29:39.970 --> 01:29:44.120
But well I think Vandelay already had his face surgery doesn't want suddenly go

3588
01:29:44.121 --> 01:29:45.090
on set with them twice

3589
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:48.570
a rampage is my buddy,

3590
01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:49.021
but he just,

3591
01:29:49.021 --> 01:29:50.030
he just doesn't want that way.

3592
01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.430
He said he wants an easy fight like vividly so.

3593
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:55.400
<v 4>Well there's a lot of history between those two guys too.</v>

3594
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:56.150
Yeah,

3595
01:29:56.150 --> 01:29:56.750
that makes sense.

3596
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:58.700
She would want to fight for him.

3597
01:29:58.840 --> 01:29:59.673
Yeah,

3598
01:29:59.750 --> 01:30:00.480
he was a vantage.

3599
01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:03.950
It was an interesting story to write when he was fighting over in pride and then

3600
01:30:03.951 --> 01:30:05.060
he came over to the UFC.

3601
01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:07.070
It just completely different human being,

3602
01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:08.510
you know,

3603
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:12.920
just in the rampage fights when rampage fought him over in prod and it also a

3604
01:30:12.921 --> 01:30:14.090
lot of miles on them too.

3605
01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:14.570
Right.

3606
01:30:14.570 --> 01:30:15.680
You got to think of both things,

3607
01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:16.933
you know.

3608
01:30:17.290 --> 01:30:18.123
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

3609
01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:21.210
she's got me thinking about felony,

3610
01:30:21.211 --> 01:30:21.811
talking about,

3611
01:30:21.811 --> 01:30:22.230
uh,

3612
01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:23.063
you know,

3613
01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:24.293
fighting him

3614
01:30:24.370 --> 01:30:25.240
<v 4>over the felony,</v>

3615
01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.680
the fight or flight crazy horse.

3616
01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:31.130
Crazy horse has now changed his name to felony ladies.

3617
01:30:31.170 --> 01:30:33.950
Gentlemen no longer refer to him as crazy yours.

3618
01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:35.310
You ever see that fight backstage

3619
01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:41.310
is nothing they swear swears up and down.

3620
01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:41.611
Yeah,

3621
01:30:41.611 --> 01:30:42.410
I beat him up.

3622
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:42.950
<v 0>Uh,</v>

3623
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:43.783
like,

3624
01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:44.881
<v 4>all right,</v>

3625
01:30:44.881 --> 01:30:48.160
so the sleep that he definitely would chose to somebody else.

3626
01:30:48.161 --> 01:30:48.330
Right.

3627
01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:49.170
Was somebody else?

3628
01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:49.590
Uh,

3629
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:53.880
but didn't he k he says he CalEd Vandelay said he sucker punched him after he

3630
01:30:53.881 --> 01:30:56.040
got choked out on the video that you see,

3631
01:30:56.370 --> 01:30:58.400
he fought later on that night and won by knockout,

3632
01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:01.350
I think after being choked unconscious in the back.

3633
01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:06.170
He said he knocked out Vandelay Oh yes.

3634
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:07.383
And Zander.

3635
01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:08.051
No,

3636
01:31:08.051 --> 01:31:08.160
no,

3637
01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:08.420
no.

3638
01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:09.253
It happened before.

3639
01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:12.840
He fought in the locker room and he went out and won.

3640
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:13.681
And then he,

3641
01:31:13.681 --> 01:31:16.560
he says he knocked out Vandelay punched him and knocked him out.

3642
01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.600
Vandelay went out and won a decision.

3643
01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:19.793
So Vandelay right.

3644
01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:21.270
If he's telling the truth,

3645
01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:23.490
he k Vandelay earlier that night.

3646
01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:27.510
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

3647
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:28.370
This is it.

3648
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:29.383
<v 4>Here's the fight.</v>

3649
01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:34.220
This is Vandelay when you know that doesn't even look like the same person.

3650
01:31:34.221 --> 01:31:35.960
I know his nose was smashed in.

3651
01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:36.813
Same Person.

3652
01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:38.803
Yeah.

3653
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:43.120
<v 2>That one's got like the Mario Brothers must,</v>

3654
01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:48.530
he tacked this dude and he got caught in a triangle.

3655
01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:54.770
Very danger.

3656
01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:55.993
Danger.

3657
01:31:58.460 --> 01:31:59.293
That's it.

3658
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:02.830
<v 4>I forget who it was that did this to him,</v>

3659
01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:05.360
but it was a one across in Greece.

3660
01:32:05.361 --> 01:32:06.310
He's black belts.

3661
01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:18.910
How big is,

3662
01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:20.560
how big is a felon,

3663
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:20.920
Gary?

3664
01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:22.450
Now you got it all here it is 150.

3665
01:32:22.451 --> 01:32:23.410
Five pounds maybe.

3666
01:32:24.170 --> 01:32:24.890
Probably.

3667
01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:25.120
Yeah,

3668
01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.120
he's out cold here.

3669
01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:31.103
<v 2>All</v>

3670
01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:33.533
right.

3671
01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:35.470
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3672
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:36.303
Out Cold.

3673
01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:40.791
<v 3>Well,</v>

3674
01:32:40.791 --> 01:32:41.690
they're very nice to him.

3675
01:32:42.230 --> 01:32:43.063
Where like they slammed,

3676
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:44.150
I believe his eyes opened up.

3677
01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:45.330
What I think like,

3678
01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:46.213
uh,

3679
01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:46.821
you did a,

3680
01:32:46.821 --> 01:32:47.870
I saw a clip the other day,

3681
01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:49.070
the guys who asked you,

3682
01:32:49.071 --> 01:32:49.904
uh,

3683
01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:51.980
what's the practical use of Jujitsu and you're like,

3684
01:32:51.981 --> 01:32:52.330
well,

3685
01:32:52.330 --> 01:32:52.820
the street,

3686
01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:53.630
if we got in a fight,

3687
01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:54.500
I would kill you.

3688
01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:55.580
That's like,

3689
01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:58.910
I think people don't realize that like without the ref to like stop the fight or

3690
01:32:58.911 --> 01:33:00.020
like though even those guys,

3691
01:33:00.021 --> 01:33:01.070
like they stopped him.

3692
01:33:01.071 --> 01:33:01.221
Like,

3693
01:33:01.221 --> 01:33:01.481
okay,

3694
01:33:01.481 --> 01:33:01.591
yeah,

3695
01:33:01.591 --> 01:33:02.061
I'll let him go.

3696
01:33:02.061 --> 01:33:05.300
He's already unconscious like that would kill you if you would be dead.

3697
01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:08.900
You would be dead if that guy doesn't want to let go of you like you does.

3698
01:33:08.901 --> 01:33:10.730
Hold on till your brain doesn't work anymore.

3699
01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:12.680
And that's a wrap and that's that.

3700
01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:15.740
That's real shit.

3701
01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:19.160
That's my friend Eric trying to come up with some excuse to not work out.

3702
01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.200
That's why I said what's the practical?

3703
01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:23.330
She's Jujitsu.

3704
01:33:23.570 --> 01:33:24.980
We had a fight I would kill.

3705
01:33:24.981 --> 01:33:29.450
You know the crazy horse fight is two guys in the basketball court.

3706
01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:31.850
I got to a big fight and then he takes it down and really,

3707
01:33:31.851 --> 01:33:32.360
really quick.

3708
01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:33.260
He tacked the guy.

3709
01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:33.741
Oh yeah,

3710
01:33:33.741 --> 01:33:34.311
he fucked up.

3711
01:33:34.311 --> 01:33:34.730
So on.

3712
01:33:34.730 --> 01:33:35.420
Oh yeah.

3713
01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:35.960
Oh He's,

3714
01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:38.480
he thinks he's a bad ass and he doesn't add a fight.

3715
01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:39.420
Oh look at this.

3716
01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:39.630
Oh,

3717
01:33:39.630 --> 01:33:39.900
oh.

3718
01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:40.790
Punching the back of the head.

3719
01:33:40.850 --> 01:33:41.440
<v 4>Oh Shit.</v>

3720
01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:41.550
Ooh,

3721
01:33:41.550 --> 01:33:42.383
look at this

3722
01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:45.130
again.

3723
01:33:45.130 --> 01:33:46.280
Are you still trying to punch him?

3724
01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:47.443
Hilarious.

3725
01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:51.680
It's taking that leg apart though.

3726
01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:52.573
Right here.

3727
01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:05.780
<v 3>He's got them in the heel hook right here.</v>

3728
01:34:05.781 --> 01:34:08.730
Cause I play basketball again by the fun that's in that position.

3729
01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:09.600
He's telling the truth.

3730
01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:09.770
Yeah.

3731
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:10.170
Right.

3732
01:34:10.170 --> 01:34:11.003
All he has to do is

3733
01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.820
<v 4>that fucking thing up clockwise and that's a rap pop,</v>

3734
01:34:13.821 --> 01:34:14.001
pop,

3735
01:34:14.001 --> 01:34:14.834
pop,

3736
01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:19.220
that horrible pain of getting,

3737
01:34:19.221 --> 01:34:20.600
he'll hooked and not Tappan.

3738
01:34:20.601 --> 01:34:21.434
Yeah.

3739
01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:23.173
Not The business.

3740
01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.410
Especially that inside.

3741
01:34:24.411 --> 01:34:28.130
He'll hook that is so nasty when it goes across the body that the amount of

3742
01:34:28.131 --> 01:34:28.970
torque on your knee,

3743
01:34:28.971 --> 01:34:30.950
this is like no way unique and hang in there.

3744
01:34:30.951 --> 01:34:31.880
It just rips apart.

3745
01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:34.840
I'm good on knee surgeries.

3746
01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:36.840
Is that that polarez

3747
01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:39.710
well he do.

3748
01:34:39.710 --> 01:34:41.240
He does outside in inside,

3749
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:43.790
but the inside one is just the outside one.

3750
01:34:43.791 --> 01:34:44.960
You got a little bit more,

3751
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:47.010
there's a little more movement like this.

3752
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.880
I mean you've got to tap,

3753
01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:52.040
but the problem is when someone's got you in this way across the body and then

3754
01:34:52.041 --> 01:34:53.180
they go like that man,

3755
01:34:53.181 --> 01:34:55.430
you got about an inch or two above it and

3756
01:34:56.970 --> 01:34:57.470
just,

3757
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:58.281
it's horrible too.

3758
01:34:58.281 --> 01:34:59.480
It sounds terrible.

3759
01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:00.590
You can hear a duck.

3760
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:05.300
Everything pulling apart and snapping off the bone and people screaming.

3761
01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:07.160
Paul Harris would not let go either.

3762
01:35:07.161 --> 01:35:07.881
That was his thing.

3763
01:35:07.881 --> 01:35:09.530
He would just hang on to heal hooks.

3764
01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:10.940
It sounds so bad.

3765
01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:11.870
It sounds so bad.

3766
01:35:11.871 --> 01:35:16.250
I got a guy with a fucking Komora there was America and uh,

3767
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:17.320
not sure what the differences,

3768
01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:18.440
but uh,

3769
01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.600
it sounds like at this is an Americana.

3770
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.823
This is the Camorra

3771
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:24.890
I think it was this way and uh,

3772
01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:26.750
it sounded like ripping a towel,

3773
01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.100
a Terry cloth towel.

3774
01:35:28.101 --> 01:35:30.200
If you pull it all apart and the fibers start popping,

3775
01:35:30.201 --> 01:35:31.100
that's what it sounded like.

3776
01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:32.900
It's still hear it in my head.

3777
01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:35.343
Oh,

3778
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:36.763
three tap.

3779
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:37.843
I mean after,

3780
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:39.230
and then he's like,

3781
01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:39.610
oh,

3782
01:35:39.610 --> 01:35:39.860
it's,

3783
01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:40.341
it's cool,

3784
01:35:40.341 --> 01:35:40.761
it's cool.

3785
01:35:40.761 --> 01:35:41.170
And I'm like,

3786
01:35:41.170 --> 01:35:42.200
that's fucking cool.

3787
01:35:42.201 --> 01:35:43.760
I didn't mean to break your fucking arm.

3788
01:35:43.761 --> 01:35:45.200
He could have just tapped dickhead.

3789
01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:45.861
Yeah,

3790
01:35:45.861 --> 01:35:46.151
I saw,

3791
01:35:46.151 --> 01:35:47.870
I got to hear this shit in my head all night.

3792
01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:49.430
I saw a video of a street fight.

3793
01:35:49.431 --> 01:35:53.540
There's another video where the dude gets a guy in an Alma Plata and he's,

3794
01:35:53.541 --> 01:35:53.721
he's,

3795
01:35:53.721 --> 01:35:54.710
he's pushes arm up.

3796
01:35:54.711 --> 01:35:56.450
You see the guys arm just give out.

3797
01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:57.321
Oh,

3798
01:35:57.321 --> 01:35:57.920
the street fight.

3799
01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:02.180
I saw like Mexico or Brazil or something.

3800
01:36:02.181 --> 01:36:02.960
Yeah.

3801
01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.010
Good groundwork though.

3802
01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:05.031
He's nice.

3803
01:36:05.031 --> 01:36:06.380
I Alma Plata in a street fight.

3804
01:36:06.381 --> 01:36:07.220
It's always a plus.

3805
01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:13.410
I mean that's the street fight game is changing drastically,

3806
01:36:14.010 --> 01:36:14.843
dude.

3807
01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:16.280
We're dangerous.

3808
01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:19.670
Dangerous kid who was like on the playground.

3809
01:36:19.671 --> 01:36:21.950
It was like flying like karate kid shit.

3810
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:25.740
Now they're going to be like rear naked choke and each other,

3811
01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.440
a little kids,

3812
01:36:27.650 --> 01:36:31.790
little kids grow up watching Bela torn the SC and kickboxing.

3813
01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:32.900
They know what a leg kick is.

3814
01:36:32.901 --> 01:36:34.250
Now they know all that shit.

3815
01:36:34.251 --> 01:36:35.780
They know how to grab the back of the head.

3816
01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:36.500
Other kids would yell,

3817
01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:36.790
Ni,

3818
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:37.170
Ni,

3819
01:36:37.170 --> 01:36:38.003
Ni,

3820
01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:39.230
they know what to do now.

3821
01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:40.093
I was this it.

3822
01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:40.821
Yeah,

3823
01:36:40.821 --> 01:36:41.511
this is it.

3824
01:36:41.511 --> 01:36:41.660
Yeah,

3825
01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:42.530
this is awful.

3826
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:43.580
The dude gets,

3827
01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:44.750
he brings out Lego.

3828
01:36:44.770 --> 01:36:45.320
That guy,

3829
01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:49.070
the guy on the top has no understanding of what to do with is over here it is.

3830
01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:50.031
Oh Sir.

3831
01:36:50.031 --> 01:36:50.840
I'm just going to,

3832
01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:51.561
here comes here,

3833
01:36:51.561 --> 01:36:52.071
comes here,

3834
01:36:52.071 --> 01:36:52.400
comes,

3835
01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.233
watch this,

3836
01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:57.800
get ready and here comes to noise.

3837
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:02.800
Awful man.

3838
01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:03.633
The sound.

3839
01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:04.701
Oh,

3840
01:37:04.701 --> 01:37:05.534
there it is.

3841
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:07.723
Oh

3842
01:37:09.370 --> 01:37:09.771
look at it.

3843
01:37:09.771 --> 01:37:12.860
Just laying fucked up backwards on his arm.

3844
01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:14.451
Oh,

3845
01:37:14.451 --> 01:37:15.260
don't move it.

3846
01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:15.861
Jesus Christ.

3847
01:37:15.861 --> 01:37:16.694
He's just laying there like

3848
01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:19.730
he must've been drunk too.

3849
01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:20.421
Cause he's like,

3850
01:37:20.421 --> 01:37:21.440
he didn't even pull his arm out.

3851
01:37:21.441 --> 01:37:22.730
He had no idea what he was doing.

3852
01:37:25.090 --> 01:37:25.640
Listen.

3853
01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:26.473
Yeah,

3854
01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:27.280
you guys see though,

3855
01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:28.210
you don't know you're in trouble.

3856
01:37:28.290 --> 01:37:29.390
Smoke Daniel.

3857
01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:30.171
Is that what that is?

3858
01:37:30.171 --> 01:37:31.004
Cigarettes there.

3859
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:32.420
These are empty.

3860
01:37:32.421 --> 01:37:33.530
It was something else in here.

3861
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:34.641
Come on man.

3862
01:37:34.641 --> 01:37:35.470
Something else.

3863
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:36.303
Do you smoke cigarettes?

3864
01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:36.861
Yes.

3865
01:37:36.861 --> 01:37:37.400
Yes I do.

3866
01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:38.240
How often you smoke?

3867
01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:40.310
Soon as I get out of here.

3868
01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:41.330
As soon as you get out of here.

3869
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:42.410
How many,

3870
01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:43.243
how many a day?

3871
01:37:44.690 --> 01:37:45.351
I tried to go,

3872
01:37:45.351 --> 01:37:46.040
uh,

3873
01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:46.850
I don't know.

3874
01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:48.860
Probably about half a back.

3875
01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.290
Jesus hanging out with this motherfucker.

3876
01:37:52.770 --> 01:37:53.260
Tell.

3877
01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:53.570
Okay.

3878
01:37:53.570 --> 01:37:54.191
This is part of it.

3879
01:37:54.191 --> 01:37:54.930
You just got to get it in.

3880
01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:55.621
He's can take it.

3881
01:37:55.621 --> 01:37:56.150
Just go ahead.

3882
01:37:56.150 --> 01:37:56.470
Get Him.

3883
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:57.303
Joe,

3884
01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:57.600
why?

3885
01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.220
Just looking out for your best interests.

3886
01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:03.000
You ever tried to switch to vape or anything like that?

3887
01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:03.451
<v 0>Uh,</v>

3888
01:38:03.451 --> 01:38:04.380

3889
01:38:04.381 --> 01:38:04.710
Listen,

3890
01:38:04.710 --> 01:38:05.910
I've done it all vape.

3891
01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:07.550
I've chewed,

3892
01:38:07.570 --> 01:38:08.403
uh,

3893
01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:10.380
tried to stop gum.

3894
01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.040
Everything.

3895
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:11.873
I just,

3896
01:38:13.410 --> 01:38:14.940
I'm a individual.

3897
01:38:14.941 --> 01:38:15.660

3898
01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:16.570
<v 4>you an individual.</v>

3899
01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:18.710
One of those weird guys.

3900
01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:20.740
Were you smoking when you were,

3901
01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:22.780
when you were the current w uh,

3902
01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:24.770
bellatore champ holds.

3903
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:25.623

3904
01:38:26.230 --> 01:38:27.063

3905
01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:27.940
that's so crazy.

3906
01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:32.820
<v 0>I miss walking since I was like chewing in smoking since I was 1213</v>

3907
01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:34.820
<v 4>there's a lot of Thai fighters or smoke,</v>

3908
01:38:34.821 --> 01:38:35.480
right?

3909
01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.580
Scar Bosky doesn't need,

3910
01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:37.610
doesn't he always smoke?

3911
01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:38.450
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

3912
01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:39.800
<v 3>Does that makes that a lot of five male,</v>

3913
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:40.431
a lot of fires.

3914
01:38:40.431 --> 01:38:44.300
I want to like put it out there like book Billy Bob last but a lot of fighters

3915
01:38:44.301 --> 01:38:46.820
that you know at high level in the UFC you smoke cigarettes.

3916
01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:50.470
<v 0>I know I used to try to hide it like they used to be one thing,</v>

3917
01:38:50.471 --> 01:38:51.610
you know and trying to hide it.

3918
01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:53.710
Oh and then you always say,

3919
01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:57.820
oh I can't believe your athlete and you're smoking until like leave me the fuck

3920
01:38:57.821 --> 01:38:58.070
alone.

3921
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:59.940
<v 4>They will hear you talk and they go man,</v>

3922
01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:04.500
well you an 80 year old blues singer Fuck's going on with your voice man.

3923
01:39:06.010 --> 01:39:07.200
Just cigarettes.

3924
01:39:09.250 --> 01:39:11.430
They give you that hard living voice.

3925
01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:17.570
<v 3>There is definitely a benefit and a level to like not hiding who you are.</v>

3926
01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:19.760
I was just talking to somebody about that today.

3927
01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:20.633
Like it is nice.

3928
01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:24.730
I could say I smoke weed and feed myself and you know,

3929
01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:25.853
whatever

3930
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.781
<v 4>shit,</v>

3931
01:39:26.781 --> 01:39:27.740
especially weed,

3932
01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:28.790
you know,

3933
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:31.640
I mean there's a lot of people that have some dumb ideas about what weed does to

3934
01:39:31.641 --> 01:39:32.000
you,

3935
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:32.301
you know?

3936
01:39:32.301 --> 01:39:36.220
And it's nice that guys like you are out about it so he could realize like no

3937
01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:39.800
real nice you guys like you are out there to pro athletes.

3938
01:39:39.801 --> 01:39:40.080
I be like,

3939
01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:40.701
I'm a stoner,

3940
01:39:40.701 --> 01:39:41.421
I'm a comedian.

3941
01:39:41.421 --> 01:39:42.260
It's like it makes sense.

3942
01:39:42.261 --> 01:39:46.820
But pro athletes like seeing like that a guy like who takes care of his body,

3943
01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:47.820
smokes weed.

3944
01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:48.140
It's not,

3945
01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:49.160
it's not ruined in his car.

3946
01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:51.710
The other thing is that the people want to think that it's lazy.

3947
01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:52.071
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

3948
01:39:52.071 --> 01:39:53.780
That's what bothers me most about the [inaudible].

3949
01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:57.230
Like the misconception of it is like that you're not a productive person that

3950
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:58.680
you just sit around in the house in Ohio.

3951
01:39:58.690 --> 01:39:59.490
But someday,

3952
01:39:59.490 --> 01:40:01.660
like on Sunday I sit around the house high as a motherfucker,

3953
01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:02.543
that shit.

3954
01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:05.000
But every other day I'm working my ass off constantly.

3955
01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:06.270
In those days off though,

3956
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:07.010
for sure,

3957
01:40:07.010 --> 01:40:07.843
for sure.

3958
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:11.410
<v 4>There's a photo in the green room from a Ryan Loco.</v>

3959
01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.530
Shout out to she had,

3960
01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:14.710
that's why you a smoking cigarettes?

3961
01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:16.630
Is that from last man standing?

3962
01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:18.390
<v 0>Okay.</v>

3963
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:19.440
<v 3>It's in between fights.</v>

3964
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:20.783
Uh,

3965
01:40:21.090 --> 01:40:21.541
yeah.

3966
01:40:21.541 --> 01:40:22.160
I think it will.

3967
01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:22.993
Um,

3968
01:40:23.010 --> 01:40:25.050
I dunno if it was the last man standing or if it was,

3969
01:40:25.110 --> 01:40:25.950
it was a locker room.

3970
01:40:25.951 --> 01:40:26.820
One of the glory fights.

3971
01:40:26.821 --> 01:40:28.530
I don't know if it was between flights or not.

3972
01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:28.890
Yeah,

3973
01:40:28.890 --> 01:40:29.580
there it is.

3974
01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:30.930
That's up in the green room right now.

3975
01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:34.870
Eddie,

3976
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:35.641
you're their officers.

3977
01:40:35.641 --> 01:40:38.160
It was like a Jimmy Hendrickson and Elvis.

3978
01:40:38.161 --> 01:40:39.630
Right at the same,

3979
01:40:40.150 --> 01:40:40.983
the 40.

3980
01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:41.530
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3981
01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:42.060
Yeah.

3982
01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.920
I got a gang of new ones coming now.

3983
01:40:43.921 --> 01:40:44.670
I got um,

3984
01:40:44.670 --> 01:40:46.950
Steven Tyler when he was a teenager,

3985
01:40:46.951 --> 01:40:48.060
got arrested for weed.

3986
01:40:48.061 --> 01:40:48.894
I got him,

3987
01:40:49.050 --> 01:40:50.040
I got Conor Mcgregor,

3988
01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:52.080
Conor Mcgregor mugshot.

3989
01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:54.340
I got the real Jimi Hendrix mugshot.

3990
01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:55.000
Not the,

3991
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.740
not the photo that we had on before,

3992
01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:00.040
which was like his real mugshot label.

3993
01:41:00.041 --> 01:41:01.480
But the photo was like from one of them,

3994
01:41:01.481 --> 01:41:03.070
Jimmy Hendrix experience photos.

3995
01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:04.780
We've got the real mugshot photo now.

3996
01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:10.060
Jimmy Hendrix had up heroin and I'm trying to go to Toronto with that heroin.

3997
01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:13.600
Here it is right there.

3998
01:41:14.590 --> 01:41:15.423
Yeah.

3999
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:17.590
When someone's tried to tell me Jimi Hendrix didn't do heroin.

4000
01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:20.800
Well tell that to the Toronto Police Department when they fuck it.

4001
01:41:20.801 --> 01:41:21.760
Arrested him for it.

4002
01:41:22.250 --> 01:41:26.870
<v 5>There's a picture of me on Instagram I saw the other day that was a Bruno Mars</v>

4003
01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:30.110
fucking Justin beaver.

4004
01:41:30.810 --> 01:41:33.500
I like to other Brits celebrities,

4005
01:41:33.501 --> 01:41:36.170
wherever they were all smiling in their mugshot and it was like,

4006
01:41:36.171 --> 01:41:37.310
wouldn't you know you have bail money?

4007
01:41:37.370 --> 01:41:38.203
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

4008
01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:41.790
they just got Vince Vaughn.

4009
01:41:42.630 --> 01:41:43.080
Yeah.

4010
01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:43.351
Yeah.

4011
01:41:43.351 --> 01:41:44.250
They just busted him.

4012
01:41:44.251 --> 01:41:45.084
Dui.

4013
01:41:45.130 --> 01:41:46.090
<v 5>Ah Sucks.</v>

4014
01:41:46.930 --> 01:41:48.280
Good chicken and drivers look good.

4015
01:41:48.281 --> 01:41:48.790
I got both.

4016
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:53.790
I got a Dui when I was 2022 on shrooms,

4017
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.990
shrooms and

4018
01:41:58.510 --> 01:41:58.870
patent.

4019
01:41:58.870 --> 01:42:00.010
They didn't give me for this room.

4020
01:42:00.011 --> 01:42:00.844
It's Bro,

4021
01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:02.980
they fucking out me for the deal.

4022
01:42:02.981 --> 01:42:05.620
I would think that maybe the shrooms would help balance out the booze.

4023
01:42:06.450 --> 01:42:09.340
The real problem was I kept arguing with the guy and he was like trying to get

4024
01:42:09.341 --> 01:42:10.360
me to blow on the street.

4025
01:42:10.361 --> 01:42:11.110
And I'm like,

4026
01:42:11.110 --> 01:42:11.943
oh yeah,

4027
01:42:13.210 --> 01:42:14.800
nothing happening like pretending to blow.

4028
01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:18.760
And then they take me downtown and I was like in and out of like falling asleep

4029
01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:21.610
and they kept like waking up and they had like the Dui,

4030
01:42:21.611 --> 01:42:21.970
uh,

4031
01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:24.850
the breathalyzer machine looks like Kinda like this or whatever,

4032
01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:26.200
the actual big machine.

4033
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:28.800
And I remember it like argument.

4034
01:42:28.810 --> 01:42:29.290
I'm like,

4035
01:42:29.290 --> 01:42:29.831
what if was,

4036
01:42:29.831 --> 01:42:30.610
if I don't blow?

4037
01:42:30.610 --> 01:42:30.971
And he's like,

4038
01:42:30.971 --> 01:42:33.040
the near you get suspended for six months.

4039
01:42:33.041 --> 01:42:33.341
And I'm like,

4040
01:42:33.341 --> 01:42:35.190
and what if I blow and it's a d and I,

4041
01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:36.310
and it's bad as a unit.

4042
01:42:36.311 --> 01:42:37.300
It was suspended for a year.

4043
01:42:37.301 --> 01:42:38.134
And I'm like,

4044
01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:41.080
and then I asked him that back and forth like 20 times I kept falling asleep.

4045
01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:43.980
<v 4>I ended up not blowing,</v>

4046
01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:44.470
but uh,

4047
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:46.950
that would make you want to not blow like,

4048
01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:48.553
yeah,

4049
01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:50.700
fucking stupid.

4050
01:42:50.701 --> 01:42:53.880
So by the time he'd go to jail or you go to court anyway,

4051
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:55.200
your suspension is almost up.

4052
01:42:55.201 --> 01:42:55.921
So I ended up,

4053
01:42:55.921 --> 01:42:57.630
I ended up getting off on that because it was,

4054
01:42:57.631 --> 01:42:58.464
uh,

4055
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:59.640
uh,

4056
01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:01.920
they pulled me over for turning the wrong way on a one way street,

4057
01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:03.570
but I just showed that I wasn't,

4058
01:43:04.110 --> 01:43:06.150
I didn't do any field sobriety tests.

4059
01:43:06.810 --> 01:43:07.380
I'm not,

4060
01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:08.370
you shouldn't drink and drive.

4061
01:43:08.371 --> 01:43:08.671
I'm not,

4062
01:43:08.671 --> 01:43:09.600
I'm trying to back that.

4063
01:43:09.630 --> 01:43:10.620
But if you do drink,

4064
01:43:11.450 --> 01:43:12.283
I uh,

4065
01:43:12.330 --> 01:43:15.300
I didn't do the field sobriety tests so they didn't have any probable cause that

4066
01:43:15.301 --> 01:43:16.140
it was actually drunk.

4067
01:43:16.230 --> 01:43:18.150
And then when he didn't blow and uh,

4068
01:43:18.151 --> 01:43:18.481
they said,

4069
01:43:18.481 --> 01:43:18.571
well,

4070
01:43:18.571 --> 01:43:20.130
he was driving the wrong way to one way street.

4071
01:43:20.131 --> 01:43:20.431
And I was like,

4072
01:43:20.431 --> 01:43:22.050
I've never been to that area before.

4073
01:43:22.110 --> 01:43:24.560
So side note technique,

4074
01:43:24.570 --> 01:43:25.320
help blow it.

4075
01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:26.153
Don't blow.

4076
01:43:27.570 --> 01:43:28.403
Yeah,

4077
01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:29.850
never had a Dui.

4078
01:43:30.150 --> 01:43:30.983
Good for you.

4079
01:43:31.010 --> 01:43:32.370
Good at driving a fucking motorcycle,

4080
01:43:32.371 --> 01:43:32.581
man.

4081
01:43:32.581 --> 01:43:33.620
You better be silver

4082
01:43:35.550 --> 01:43:36.780
plus you're smoking cigarettes,

4083
01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:37.980
not paying attention what you're doing.

4084
01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:38.590
I mean,

4085
01:43:38.590 --> 01:43:41.600
with Uber and Lyft and all this shit now it's Kinda,

4086
01:43:41.601 --> 01:43:43.770
it's a pretty irresponsible to get a fucking Dui.

4087
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:46.970
I bet it's dropped down significantly because of Uber and Lyft.

4088
01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:48.840
I really bet it has for sure.

4089
01:43:48.841 --> 01:43:49.674
I think so.

4090
01:43:50.010 --> 01:43:50.581
Listen Boys,

4091
01:43:50.581 --> 01:43:51.470
let's wrap this bitch up.

4092
