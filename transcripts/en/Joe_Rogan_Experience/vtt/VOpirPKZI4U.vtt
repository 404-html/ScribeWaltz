1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.500
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.290
<v Speaker 1>You don't talk about Asians have your,</v>

3
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:06.450
<v Speaker 1>your reality of your situation,</v>

4
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.141
<v Speaker 1>like your family,</v>

5
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:08.260
<v Speaker 1>like you don't want to talk about though.</v>

6
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.143
<v Speaker 1>I talked to everything.</v>

7
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>You tell everybody on the whole story what you did and why you can't go back to</v>

8
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

9
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.341
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

10
00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:13.981
<v Speaker 1>I could go back.</v>

11
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I just can't get out.</v>

12
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>You can't get out once you go back.</v>

13
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine so.</v>

14
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.183
<v Speaker 1>There's probably,</v>

15
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>there's probably like a criminal record.</v>

16
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Tell it's a little different because tell everybody what happened if you want it</v>

18
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.900
<v Speaker 1>to mean this is an interesting story over.</v>

19
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

21
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.623
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>if you want to listen on that,</v>

23
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.133
<v Speaker 1>not a problem at all.</v>

24
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>That's the only reason why I brought this up because I know you're pretty</v>

25
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 1>adamant about expressing yourself all the time.</v>

26
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.193
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

27
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.530
<v Speaker 1>I would say before I finished,</v>

28
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>started the story that uh,</v>

30
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Dave was a wrestler in Japan September of 2003 in the same week I was in jail in</v>

31
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:51.321
<v Speaker 1>La County.</v>

32
00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:52.880
<v Speaker 1>So I guess we were meant to meet each other,</v>

33
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:54.560
<v Speaker 1>but they apart 10 years ago,</v>

34
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.521
<v Speaker 1>this coming September,</v>

35
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:56.240
<v Speaker 1>we're in jail.</v>

36
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.451
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

37
00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:57.410
<v Speaker 1>someone sounds like a stock.</v>

38
00:00:57.411 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

39
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.660
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what I would send an email if I was trying to get them to get me</v>

40
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:03.494
<v Speaker 1>pregnant.</v>

41
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.493
<v Speaker 1>So what's your,</v>

42
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.453
<v Speaker 1>tell us your story.</v>

43
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.460
<v Speaker 1>So I got an email in August,</v>

44
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>2003 from my cousin.</v>

45
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Basically my writing skill in Japanese isn't that good.</v>

46
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:17.120
<v Speaker 1>So he wrote it in English.</v>

47
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.250
<v Speaker 1>He basically could row pop up dead.</v>

48
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.780
<v Speaker 1>That's their nice went dead.</v>

49
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.770
<v Speaker 1>My father was dead,</v>

50
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't know how to write in English.</v>

51
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.560
<v Speaker 1>So that's the only thing.</v>

52
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:25.130
<v Speaker 1>They were well,</v>

53
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.670
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

54
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.030
<v Speaker 1>I called them and find out my dad supposedly killed himself.</v>

55
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.810
<v Speaker 1>So wedding couple of days I flew back to Japan and find out what happened</v>

56
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.160
<v Speaker 1>because I saw him six months before,</v>

57
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 1>early 2003.</v>

58
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Speaker 1>I find out that my step mother was cheating on my dad before marriage,</v>

60
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:40.641
<v Speaker 1>during marriage.</v>

61
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:40.881
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

62
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:41.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.810
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to,</v>

64
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.130
<v Speaker 1>they're in process getting divorced,</v>

65
00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>but my dad killed himself later.</v>

66
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

67
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>We don't know for sure.</v>

68
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.380
<v Speaker 1>He commit suicide or my stepmother have something to do with his death.</v>

69
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.130
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

70
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.461
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

71
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

72
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>during the funeral I sold my step mother killed him.</v>

73
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you think she killed?</v>

74
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

75
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that the more I hear the story,</v>

76
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:00.140
<v Speaker 1>she sounds like the most,</v>

77
00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:00.620
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

78
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>my cousins older brought in Korea.</v>

79
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.030
<v Speaker 1>She was living in Korea at my stepmother.</v>

80
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.260
<v Speaker 1>So my cousins,</v>

81
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Speaker 1>older brother lives in Korea,</v>

82
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.190
<v Speaker 1>their virgin FBI,</v>

83
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.640
<v Speaker 1>they've checked the background and my stepmother flew in the day before.</v>

84
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.900
<v Speaker 1>The last time they saw my dad alive.</v>

85
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean that he killed her,</v>

86
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

87
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.041
<v Speaker 1>she lies,</v>

88
00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:21.874
<v Speaker 1>she killed him.</v>

89
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.580
<v Speaker 1>She said that she wasn't in Japan the whole time and we find out later why she</v>

90
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:25.970
<v Speaker 1>lied.</v>

91
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:26.803
<v Speaker 1>She lied about that.</v>

92
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

93
00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Speaker 1>she lied about that.</v>

94
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:28.720
<v Speaker 1>That's that,</v>

95
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.710
<v Speaker 1>that kind of guilt lying about where you were very suspicious.</v>

96
00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.930
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't mean she did it die.</v>

98
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.600
<v Speaker 1>How did he die?</v>

99
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

100
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.070
<v Speaker 1>hanging.</v>

101
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.420
<v Speaker 1>So I went to police station and saw the picture and he was in the hot sun for</v>

102
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:42.530
<v Speaker 1>like two weeks.</v>

103
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.270
<v Speaker 1>So he was dark.</v>

104
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

105
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>he looked like we just hanging outside inside.</v>

106
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:48.980
<v Speaker 1>But that summertime,</v>

107
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:49.281
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>

108
00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:50.390
<v Speaker 1>it's so hot and humid,</v>

109
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.040
<v Speaker 1>a decomposing.</v>

110
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.491
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

111
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:54.080
<v Speaker 1>this is how I met Yoshi told us.</v>

112
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.920
<v Speaker 1>What was the joke?</v>

113
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.750
<v Speaker 1>It was the darkest joke I've ever heard in my life.</v>

114
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.280
<v Speaker 1>What did I say?</v>

115
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Told the joke.</v>

116
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a joke.</v>

117
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:06.120
<v Speaker 1>I just say,</v>

118
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

119
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>he was darker than a nigger or whatever.</v>

120
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

121
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:10.354
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

122
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>that is not a dark joke or even a good one.</v>

123
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>But a racial slur darker than Bobby Lee's balls.</v>

124
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

125
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>So Bobby Lee have dark balls as black balls.</v>

126
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.521
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

127
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

128
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I can't approve of that.</v>

129
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 1>That joke.</v>

130
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Do you don't say that on stage,</v>

131
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>dude?</v>

132
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

133
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.021
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

134
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

135
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.981
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

136
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:27.761
<v Speaker 1>this guy's crazy.</v>

137
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

138
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

139
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>That's how you ended your act or somebody.</v>

140
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way to get your ass kicked.</v>

141
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Not yet,</v>

142
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to have.</v>

143
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>But basically he had been hanging and he turned black.</v>

144
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.670
<v Speaker 1>So he was hanging and basically the heat of the house just slowly cooked him.</v>

145
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:44.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

147
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:44.930
<v Speaker 1>I showed the picture.</v>

148
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.763
<v Speaker 1>The cop told me,</v>

149
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>I highly recommend you don't look at the picture,</v>

150
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>but I needed to see,</v>

151
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>because after his death,</v>

153
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>my family farm,</v>

154
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.410
<v Speaker 1>he told me that all the horrible things that were have.</v>

155
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that she could have possibly driven him to do that?</v>

156
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

157
00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.751
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

158
00:03:58.751 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 1>100% yeah.</v>

159
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 1>She lived hundreds of thousands of dead.</v>

161
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.360
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

162
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.020
<v Speaker 1>she told my dad that she brought one of her cousin from Korea.</v>

163
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.980
<v Speaker 1>We later on find out it was her lover,</v>

164
00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>her the whole time.</v>

165
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>So while my dad was working,</v>

166
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 1>she was fucking this guy pretending to be her cousin,</v>

167
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

168
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Just the whole humiliation,</v>

169
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>debt and all that stuff.</v>

170
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.731
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

171
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:19.564
<v Speaker 1>was she younger?</v>

172
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.801
<v Speaker 1>10 years younger,</v>

173
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:21.634
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

174
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>are you sure she wasn't just fucking her cousin.</v>

175
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.490
<v Speaker 1>This is why a guy like David should be afraid of marriage.</v>

176
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.383
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

177
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Never ever,</v>

178
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.280
<v Speaker 1>never fuck someone where you're confused as to why they're fucking you or never.</v>

179
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.333
<v Speaker 1>But then</v>

180
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.990
<v Speaker 1>the reality is the natural law,</v>

181
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.501
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

182
00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:41.251
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't get laid,</v>

183
00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:42.084

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.620
<v Speaker 1>she'd get your shit together first.</v>

185
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:44.671
<v Speaker 1>But so,</v>

186
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:45.001
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

187
00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:47.520
<v Speaker 1>so that happens when you do that man,</v>

188
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.110
<v Speaker 1>people start to resent.</v>

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 1>She left sounds and then 10 seconds later I just started running over and just</v>

276
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Speaker 1>beating the shit out of her and I grabbed back of her head and start punching</v>

277
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:30.070
<v Speaker 1>their face for a long time and put her in.</v>

278
00:07:30.071 --> 00:07:30.950
<v Speaker 1>She's unconscious.</v>

279
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.491
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

280
00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:34.520
<v Speaker 1>but she was shocked because she didn't know I had an inmate to do that and I was</v>

281
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 1>a little surprised because I didn't plan to do that.</v>

282
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:36.944
<v Speaker 1>I was angry,</v>

283
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.671
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't take,</v>

284
00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 1>she was dumb enough to be separated by the rest of her family.</v>

285
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:40.844
<v Speaker 1>But she was arrested.</v>

286
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.340
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

287
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.171
<v Speaker 1>she was by herself.</v>

288
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:42.801
<v Speaker 1>You are by herself.</v>

289
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:44.750
<v Speaker 1>No one is anywhere near no one near.</v>

290
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:48.440
<v Speaker 1>And instead of grab her back of her head and just started beating her face in</v>

291
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.860
<v Speaker 1>stop and uh,</v>

292
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.190
<v Speaker 1>put on her ground and it starts stumping between her legs.</v>

293
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 1>They're like eyeballs stomped her pussy stomach.</v>

294
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Then her face or eyeballs,</v>

295
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.170
<v Speaker 1>well to come out I was stomping her face like have to five or six times and I</v>

296
00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 1>heard some lady that work at the cemetery scream.</v>

297
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:07.970
<v Speaker 1>That's when I kind of just stomping on this lady and started screaming.</v>

298
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.100
<v Speaker 1>So how much damage did you do to her?</v>

299
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I think if I did it,</v>

300
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.760
<v Speaker 1>like my cousin called me in like week later and he was laughing,</v>

301
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.310
<v Speaker 1>he was laughing on the phone like yeah,</v>

302
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 1>if you did it for another menu,</v>

303
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:18.141
<v Speaker 1>probably killed her,</v>

304
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:18.561
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

305
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:21.050
<v Speaker 1>She ended up going to hospital for like two and a half,</v>

306
00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:21.884
<v Speaker 1>three months.</v>

307
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.690
<v Speaker 1>But that snapped him out of it.</v>

308
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:24.590
<v Speaker 1>The lady screaming.</v>

309
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.270
<v Speaker 1>So then he ran back down the hill.</v>

310
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

311
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:27.763
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>

312
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 1>like everyone's like what the fuck's going on?</v>

313
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>And he like grabbed his cousin's car keys.</v>

314
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:31.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

315
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:32.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

316
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:32.963
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

317
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

318
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I went down and uh,</v>

319
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Speaker 1>my stepmother's nephew was walking up the stairs.</v>

320
00:08:38.781 --> 00:08:39.640
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know what's going on.</v>

321
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.820
<v Speaker 1>So I started coming down and he doesn't know what's going on.</v>

322
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.240
<v Speaker 1>So I figured by then I already beat one person.</v>

323
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:45.510
<v Speaker 1>What difference does it make if I have,</v>

324
00:08:45.511 --> 00:08:46.540
<v Speaker 1>so this guy goes,</v>

325
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.120
<v Speaker 1>peoples,</v>

326
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.460
<v Speaker 1>this funeral was how long after Japan,</v>

327
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 1>but like when you got off the plane and went straight to the funeral,</v>

328
00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

329
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.321
<v Speaker 1>A day after.</v>

330
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

331
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 1>So this guy gets the Japan,</v>

332
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 1>goes to a funeral and then just starts punching people and then like,</v>

333
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 1>so you attacked him as well?</v>

334
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>For what reason?</v>

335
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Just because I feel related to her,</v>

336
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.410
<v Speaker 1>to her and like what difference does it make if I fuck everybody at this point?</v>

337
00:09:09.411 --> 00:09:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

338
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.321
<v Speaker 1>It's like porn stars.</v>

339
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Like what difference does it make you feel about fuck one hooker or 500 once you</v>

340
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 1>do one,</v>

341
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.380
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting.</v>

342
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.710
<v Speaker 1>You're using attempted murder and connecting it to gang bang.</v>

343
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

344
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Yoshi kills hookers all the time.</v>

345
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.213
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

346
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.510
<v Speaker 1>And kills him with his aids.</v>

347
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.770
<v Speaker 1>So the animals are out a boy that a boy.</v>

348
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.170
<v Speaker 1>So I went down the stairs,</v>

349
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:34.681
<v Speaker 1>I saw him,</v>

350
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:35.550
<v Speaker 1>I sucker punch him.</v>

351
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know what's going on.</v>

352
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

353
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.160
<v Speaker 1>And there was a little,</v>

354
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:38.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

355
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:39.600
<v Speaker 1>feel bad for that.</v>

356
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:39.901
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

357
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:40.734
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

358
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.560
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

359
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I wish I want to do with it.</v>

360
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I know by was just angry with her and her family.</v>

361
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

362
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.150
<v Speaker 1>But mean her family is just people.</v>

363
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

364
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Don't feel bad of poisoning poisonous Pete.</v>

365
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:52.621
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

366
00:09:52.621 --> 00:09:53.071
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

367
00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't know what the fuck the sister and her dad at the time.</v>

368
00:09:56.521 --> 00:09:56.761
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

369
00:09:56.761 --> 00:09:57.760
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't really rationale.</v>

370
00:09:57.761 --> 00:09:59.120
<v Speaker 1>It was just so angry.</v>

371
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 1>So I sucker punching.</v>

372
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:02.220
<v Speaker 1>He went down.</v>

373
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.210
<v Speaker 1>It'll most of these eight,</v>

374
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm six foot one.</v>

375
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Most of these people are like five one five two.</v>

376
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.970
<v Speaker 1>So even though I'm not a physically imposing in America,</v>

377
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty big in Japan.</v>

378
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.120
<v Speaker 1>You're kicking ass in jail.</v>

379
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm Anderson Silva when it comes to fighting and beating up old women.</v>

380
00:10:14.631 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 1>But so how old was she when you did this to her?</v>

381

<v Speaker 1>55 or something.</v>

382
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

386

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:28.794
<v Speaker 1>I would've killed her.</v>

393
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

394
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.320
<v Speaker 1>if I'm stomping on a check for five times,</v>

395
00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:32.154
<v Speaker 1>she's dead.</v>

396
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the fuck your pussy stomps allowed her to live.</v>

<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

402

419
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.220

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.010
<v Speaker 1>So you punched him too?</v>

439
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:39.211
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

440
00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:39.301
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

441
00:11:39.301 --> 00:11:39.660
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

442
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.493
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

443
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.460
<v Speaker 1>If I think he hesitated because he doesn't want a somebody who did criminal</v>

444
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.990
<v Speaker 1>acts,</v>

445
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.380
<v Speaker 1>but he's smaller than I am,</v>

446
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:46.960
<v Speaker 1>so if you don't take,</v>

447
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to beat the shit out of it.</v>

448
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

449
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:53.330
<v Speaker 1>we got in his car and he's driving me out of there and I went to Osaka</v>

450
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:53.620
<v Speaker 1>International.</v>

451
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.790
<v Speaker 1>He just got to Japan.</v>

452
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

453
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 1>like a day before and then he went and beat everyone up and then he's hiding.</v>

454
00:11:58.121 --> 00:11:59.260
<v Speaker 1>You got right to the airport?</v>

455
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I grabbed his cell phone and call the airlines,</v>

456
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.703
<v Speaker 1>changed my flight.</v>

457
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm praying there's another fly with the flowers and there just happened to be</v>

458
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 1>one in four hours,</v>

459
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:08.260
<v Speaker 1>so I went over there,</v>

460
00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 1>but that was the longest full hours airport because I figure she'll call the</v>

461
00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 1>police and just hid in the bathroom.</v>

462
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:16.990
<v Speaker 1>What happened had they not call the police and never even occurred to them</v>

463
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.730
<v Speaker 1>because they were so worried about her.</v>

464
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.571
<v Speaker 1>They went to hospital.</v>

465
00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Whether they probably didn't know where you went.</v>

466
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.170
<v Speaker 1>They figured out they figured out what's hiding somebody.</v>

467
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 1>One of my cousin's house.</v>

468
00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.590
<v Speaker 1>You think that they knew that she was guilty too?</v>

469
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

470
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:28.920
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows she's the returns.</v>

471
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.450
<v Speaker 1>How did you find out it was your aunt that told you,</v>

472
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:31.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

473
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

474
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.550
<v Speaker 1>It was her trying to poison him.</v>

475
00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

476
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:34.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

477
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Your aunt told you,</v>

478
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:35.854
<v Speaker 1>what did she say?</v>

479
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.330
<v Speaker 1>They have a medical record.</v>

480
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Someone this whole time.</v>

481
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

482
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

483
00:12:38.771 --> 00:12:40.060
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean she tried to kill him.</v>

484
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

485
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.370
<v Speaker 1>She tried to kill him because of the poisoning.</v>

486
00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Now that's pretty definitive.</v>

487
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

488
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:45.700
<v Speaker 1>And they had a medical lab.</v>

489
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:46.001
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

490
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:47.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they figure a poison,</v>

491
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:48.090
<v Speaker 1>but they took it to the lab.</v>

492
00:12:48.091 --> 00:12:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Ever Eat Kimchi at Yoshi,</v>

493
00:12:49.281 --> 00:12:50.114
<v Speaker 1>his house,</v>

494
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.350
<v Speaker 1>he keeps his daddy stabbing.</v>

495
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Kimchi in general is pretty strong.</v>

496
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I love Kimchi,</v>

497
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Kimchi at Yoshi cells and it tastes a little weird.</v>

498
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:58.683
<v Speaker 1>Don't eat that shit.</v>

499
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.401
<v Speaker 1>Damn Dude.</v>

500
00:13:00.401 --> 00:13:02.050
<v Speaker 1>So you escaped Japan.</v>

501
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

502
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.520
<v Speaker 1>And the other criminal charges pressed against him.</v>

503
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Here's a weird thing.</v>

504
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Mostly comps in Japan doing or be a part of like family dispute with technical.</v>

505
00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:12.430
<v Speaker 1>She's still my family.</v>

506
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.160
<v Speaker 1>So whenever there's a fan of me at each boot,</v>

507
00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:14.890
<v Speaker 1>they'd rather,</v>

508
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.920
<v Speaker 1>there's even a fucking head stomping.</v>

509
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:18.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

510
00:13:18.221 --> 00:13:19.300
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

511
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.433
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

512
00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go back to Japan.</v>

513
00:13:21.841 --> 00:13:22.241
<v Speaker 1>To find out.</v>

514
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 1>So when remember you,</v>

515
00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:24.660
<v Speaker 1>and I think Jody's it.</v>

516
00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:26.170
<v Speaker 1>D has asked me and like the goal,</v>

517
00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:26.950
<v Speaker 1>but you can translate.</v>

518
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I would love to do it,</v>

519
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.700
<v Speaker 1>but I was little worried.</v>

520
00:13:29.701 --> 00:13:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe as soon as I land,</v>

521
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.240
<v Speaker 1>there's a record of it and put me in jail.</v>

522
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.151
<v Speaker 1>There could be right?</v>

523
00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:34.720
<v Speaker 1>There might be.</v>

524
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.553
<v Speaker 1>There might be.</v>

525
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.000
<v Speaker 1>You ready to record record?</v>

526
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:06.331
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

527
00:14:06.331 --> 00:14:07.164
<v Speaker 1>it is already.</v>

528
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.250
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck's on?</v>
