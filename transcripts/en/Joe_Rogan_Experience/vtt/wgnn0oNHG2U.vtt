1
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.500
Hey everybody,
what the fuck?

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.560
It's Valentine's Day almost.
It's coming up soon.

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.490
Just one of those dangerous holidays.
We got to do something.

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.320
Can't just forget that one.
Valentine's is tricky.
Is it?
Do,
uh,

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.300
do the gays give out the flowers
and they give out the flowers?

6
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.030
The flowers traits must give out the flowers,
the gaze as well.
I don't know.

7
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:34.570
I don't go on dates.
I say no.
The answer is no.
We've got confirmation.
I mean,

8
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.330
either way they end up dying,
you know,
flowers or the gaze.

9
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.720
Both.
Jesus.
We all die.
Flowers and gaze is fucking,
she says,

10
00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:46.800
we're just right off the bat.
I'm trying to sell flowers here,
fellow.

11
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:50.850
This is a sponsor.
One 800 flowers.com.
A really cool sponsor.

12
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.900
Like going to the florist.
You don't want to get caught in florist.
What happens?

13
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.590
You look like a bitch.
Let's be honest.
If you're a man wandering into a florist,

14
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.420
he looked like somebody done whooped you son,
take care of your shit online.

15
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.130
Keep your hands clean and keep it on the DL.
Uh,
this year,

16
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.821
really?

17
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:13.821
Wow her with a beautiful bouquet that she would love from one 800 flowers.com.

18
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.720
Your rose authority.
Um,
these are beautiful flowers.

19
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:23.370
If you look at some of these,
uh,
bouquets that they sell,
uh,
for Valentine's Day,

20
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:26.950
for whatever,
for birthdays,
for anything,
they're really pretty.
Um,

21
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.830
I know it's not manly to love flowers,
but I do flower.
I think they're beautiful.

22
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:33.240
They're neat.
They're nature's artwork.

23
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.760
I don't know what it is about things that are beautiful that gives you a feeling

24
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:41.430
like when you see em right here,
Joe,
beautiful forest,

25
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.220
when you see a beautiful sunset,
like I'm not exactly sure what beauty is.

26
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.020
I don't know why it works.

27
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.880
I don't know what it is about looking at flowers and make me go,
wow.
Hmm.

28
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.160
I Dunno.
I Dunno what it is.

29
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.870
I feel the same way when I look at a nice Instagram sunset.
Yeah.
What is that?

30
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.100
But when you see a sunset in real life,
it's better.
Way better,
but really rise.

31
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.580
But what is it about things that are beautiful?
I mean,
I don't know.

32
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.730
Why would it be evolutionary advantageous for us to be attracted to the look of

33
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:15.210
flowers?
Why would it give us such a good feeling?
It doesn't really make sense.

34
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.200
I don't understand it.
I mean,
did you can't eat?
I guess you can eat them.

35
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:23.130
You can eat some of them at least,
but that's not it.
I wouldn't say I hate that.

36
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.830
I don't want to eat a flower.
There's supposed to be pretty good.
Yeah,

37
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.180
they're roses salad.
Yeah,
but I mean,
just something,
it's not right.

38
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.950
I have a roses in my yard and deers eat them.
They're always eating my flour.

39
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.610
I should say dear,
but I'm unsophisticated.
Um,

40
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.890

You go walking around picking daisies for and she's like,

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.280
You Ain't getting none of this.

54
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.261
<v 1>Have you ever done that?</v>

55
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:38.230
Have you ever gone on a date or go over to somebody's house and pick somebody

56
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:39.250
else's flowers from?

57
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.960
<v 0>No,
I never have.
No,
I don't.
Um,</v>

58
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.330
I mean I've definitely bought flowers before.

59
00:03:45.331 --> 00:03:48.900
I just can't think of how many times.
It hasn't been a lot,
but I wouldn't,

60
00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:51.530
you know,
I dunno,
man.
People are weird about that.
Like people,

61
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.130
some people want people to buy them shit.
They would rather you buy them shit,

62
00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:59.190
then pick up some flowers somewhere that you saw.
Like,

63
00:03:59.191 --> 00:04:01.620
I would think if I was a check and the guy came over and he said,

64
00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:03.370
I saw these flowers and there were,
you know,

65
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.700
in a field and a wild field and they were really beautiful,

66
00:04:05.701 --> 00:04:06.534
so I thought I'd bring him over.

67
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.530
I would like that even more than someone going to a fucking store where

68
00:04:10.531 --> 00:04:14.040
someone's been raising these things,
they're not special.
Okay.

69
00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:17.940
They're being really on your flowers.
Wild,
wild,

70
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.500
wild flowers looked like shit.
Yeah,

71
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.560
they're kind of want to get some good flowers.

72
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.800
It's got to go to one 800 stamps.com and enter in the code word j r e.

73

00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:36.150

78
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.520
So go do that chick's ticket.
I don't understand that either,
but look,

79
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.270
you want to get laid right?
You want to keep her happy,
right?
I don't know.

80
00:04:57.271 --> 00:05:00.780
If you want to keep her happy,
you might not want it.
Don't listen to me.

81
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.180
Just don't get that baby's breath stuff.
That's weird.

82
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.650
What is babies brand set that you know what I'm talking about?

83
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.190
It's like that white little,

84
00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:12.370
those little white little things they put in the flowers.
No,

85
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.680
<v 1>and it has a weird day.
Not like the baby's breath.
Do not get us Bavis breath.</v>

86
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:20.490
I remember as a kid,
I thought there was a connection from babies.
I know,

87
00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:23.320
I thought it was too.
I was like,
did they steal the breath from babies?

88
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:25.690
What kind of witchcraft is this?
On Valentine's Day,

89
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.590
<v 0>we're also brought to you by Squarespace.
Squarespace who a,</v>

90
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:33.910
I got a chance to meet the Squarespace guys this weekend in New York City and a

91
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.840
very,
very cool guys.
Uh,
so it's nice to actually put a face to a company.

92
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.920
The company is excellent.
The product,
what they sell,

93
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.820
they have a website where you can make your own website and it's easy.

94
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:47.650
A dummy like myself could do it.

95
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.950
It's all about drag and drop and point and click.

96
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:53.890
Just the regular functions of using a computer.
If you're,

97
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:58.190
you know how to open up Microsoft word,
if you know how to you fuck around

98
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.360
<v 2>with your iPhone or whatever,
you can figure out how to use Squarespace.</v>

99
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.400
It's not complicated and it is excellent and they let you try it before you even

100
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:11.360
buy it.
They don't have to enter in your credit card information.
Just sign up,

101
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.740
give it a run,
check it out and you'll go,
oh,
this is pretty fucking bad ass.

102
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:19.790
And then I'll be like,
I told you bitch.
And then once you do that,

103
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.090
you can get 10% off your purchase for a free trial and 10% off your purchase.

104
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.160
If you enter in the code word Joe,
that's just Joe,
no numbers anymore.

105
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:36.161
Squarespace wizened the fuck up and dropped the stupid numbers after every show.

106
00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:37.560
One and Joe to

107
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.470
a Squarespace has beautiful designs for you to start with.

108
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:45.110
You could start not just creating your own website,

109
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:47.930
but putting on your own online store,
including musicians.

110
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.450
They have it set up really easily,
uh,

111
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:53.810
where you can really easily sell digital music from your website.

112
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.820
It's a very dope malicious and uh,
we are,
we are very,

113
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:01.300
uh,
very,
very happy with this company.
That's nice.

114
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.850
Nothing but positive reviews from all of our fans and friends that have,
uh,

115
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.300
have used it,
including a y.

116
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.570
I Know Carrie Santa Maria organized her all over digital media using Squarespace

117
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:17.540
and Dunkin uses Squarespace.
It was funny because one of the guys was there.

118
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.630
It's like we've got our support ticket for Duncan Trussell and we were like,

119
00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:22.430
wait a minute,
what the fuck is that?

120
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:26.270
The Real Duncan Trussell and then it was Duncan Duncan Trussell need to figure

121
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:30.470

125
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.420
Did you blow off your New Year's resolution already?
Is it already over?

126
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.300
Did you already start eating sugar and drinking liquor?

127
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.650
Did you stop working out already?
Go to audits,

Get a Zombie Bell.
That's kettlebells that look like zombies.

130
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.470
Learn how to use them and prepare for the apocalypse because Yellowstone is

131
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:08.840
going to blow.
I'm going to talk about that on the podcast today.

132
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.300
Massive volcanic activity.

133
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.480
They need to call Dera Val volcano at Yellowstone so much that they ran out of

134
00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:19.850
red ink.
Oh Shit.

135
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.920
There's so much volcanic activity that the seismograph ran out of ink.
Jesus.

136
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:28.010
Fucking Louise's.
That's fine.

137
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.910
We're going to go lays down anyway.
Gay Self,
a Zombie Kettlebells,

138
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.970
hair for the apocalypse.
You don't want to be a skinny,

139
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:38.090
weak bitch when the apocalypse comes and you don't want to smoke cigarettes

140
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:42.200
either.
So quit the cigarettes and get start off light.
Don't get nutty,
man.

141
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:46.220
Get yourself like a Goblin.
The brain Goblin one is only 18 pounds.

142
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.190
It seems like it would be too much for a week,
bitch like you.
But I,
I've,

143
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.890
I've confidence that we'll get you a few exercises with 18 pounds and build you

144
00:08:54.891 --> 00:08:57.760
up 35 but most important is,
um,

145
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.020
learn the functional movements of kettle bells before you use any of these

146
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:02.310
things.
I've said it before,

147
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:04.740
I'll say it a thousand times cause I don't want anybody getting hurt.

148
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:07.020
Start off light.
Learn how to do it.

149
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:11.730
Either go to a trainer and pay someone to show you correct movement or be very

150
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:16.680
careful and watch a DVD and watch yourself and maybe even film yourself and

151
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:19.770
watch yourself to see if you're doing the exact same movements as the DVD so you

152
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:23.400
can really make sure that you're not putting any undue stress on any of your

153
00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:25.330
joints.
Getting injured when you can have,

154
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.860
could have avoided it by being smart is one of the most frustrating things a

155
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:32.640
person can ever experience because you just feel like such a fucking idiot for

156
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:36.580
getting injured,
doing something that you could have avoided.
Um,

157
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.720
we sell all sorts of fitness equipment that benefits functional movement.

158
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.740
And what functional movement is.

159
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.010
It's not just bodybuilding exercises that make you look better,

160
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.340
but things that make you your body work as one unit.

161
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.060
Like for the longest time people didn't understand lifting weights.

162
00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:58.620
They would do like one body group this day,
the other body group that day.

163
00:09:58.621 --> 00:10:00.570
And that does make your muscles grow bigger.

164
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.370
But what it doesn't do is get your muscles used to communicating with each other

165
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:09.600
while doing something and developing your balance and developing your core

166
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:10.081
strength.

167
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:13.740
And there's a lot of things at bodybuilding type exercises just don't take care

168
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:15.150
of.
That's where kettle bells come in.

169
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.710
It's the most effective way to condition your body with weights and you with a

170
00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:22.980
72 pound kettlebell or two 72 pound kettle bells,
you will literally,

171
00:10:22.981 --> 00:10:26.700
I don't care how big you are,
never have to get different kettlebells.
72 pounds.

172
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:29.880
You can get ruthless workouts with two 72 pound kettle bells,

173
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.460
no matter who you are.
You can be a fucking heavyweight.

174
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.660
You're still gonna get a ruthless workout with two set and they'll last forever.

175
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:41.070
These fucking things are solid metal.
They will be here long after we're gone.

176
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.220
The aliens will find them and they'll try to fucking piece together are

177
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.120
shattered civilization and they'll try to figure out why we worship zombies and

178
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:48.954
monkeys,

179
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.650

183
00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:12.531
or Himalayan salt or super foods like this new supplement that we have that is a

earth grown nutrients,

192
00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.700
<v 0>Captain Martin [inaudible].
What's up guys?
Tape Joe.
How are Ya?
Good.</v>

193
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:04.570
What's cracking dude?
You know,
live in a dream.
You are living in a dream.

194
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.880
You're living your dream.
Justin Martin live in my dream world.
Yes.
Yeah.
Thanks.

195
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:13.540
Good things are good until the world ends,
which is tomorrow.
Apparently.

196
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:18.520
Jesus,
apparently Yellowstone's volcano has been active today.

197
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:23.350
By the way.
I read one website about this.
Didn't verify it at all.
Um,

198
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.850
not only that,
uh,

199
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.300
I don't want to bear it by it because what if they're wrong and then I can't

200
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:32.800
freak out for the day.
Yeah,
no reason to freak out.
What time is it?
It's only 12.

201
00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:37.210
20.
Let's wait for a panic attack around like three.
Shelly.
Yeah.
I wonder,
um,

202
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.210
I'll probably have to look at some other websites to see if this is actually

203
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:42.580
accurate because I've been reading a bunch of things on Fukushima.

204
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:43.301
It's kind of interesting,

205
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:47.380
like I was reading like all about radiation and the fish and everything,

206
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.210
but then there's the scientist that I was reading,

207
00:12:49.211 --> 00:12:53.170
like they coulda caught a halibut from right off shore from Fukushima and we've

208
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.500
tested it and it was okay to eat liars,
right?
Yeah.

209
00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.270
<v 1>My Dad owned me.
Like I was like,
I wish I could go back to Japan.
And he was like,</v>

210
00:13:00.271 --> 00:13:03.150
why wouldn't you go back to Japan?
And I'm like,
well,
you know,
the radiation.

211
00:13:03.151 --> 00:13:07.230
He goes,
you know,
there's people that work at round that radiation plan they had,

212
00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.360
they could only work there like five days in a row,

213
00:13:09.361 --> 00:13:11.520
but they have to get out of there before it starts affecting them.

214
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.580
But it's not like you're going to go over there and

215
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.170
<v 0>no shitting Brian.
They're mutants now.
They have powers.
Yeah.
You don't know shit.</v>

216
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.930
Yeah,
you're wrong.
Here's a,
here's a thing about the Yellowstone thing.
No,
no.

217
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.920
Is this today?
This is today.
Yeah.

218
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.960
I'm reading about y'all stone volcanic activity.
So what are they saying?
Uh,

219
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:36.840
hear me.
There's actually,
okay.
Is this the,

220
00:13:36.841 --> 00:13:40.980
um,
the newest?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

221
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:45.300
Huge magma pocket lurks beneath Yellowstone.
Super Volcano,

222
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.100
not a magma pocket.

223
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:52.410
A large earthquake at Yellowstone is much more likely than a volcanic eruption.

224
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:57.360
They said,
God dammit,
just let me shoot a pilot.
You know,

225
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.630
that's all I wanted.
It's so close.
It's supposed to be this month.

226
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:05.270
Let me hit syndications.
Let me get something.
Jesus.
Okay.
Yeah.

227
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:06.630
35

228
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.950
<v 4>seismic stations send information could continuous.</v>

229
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:15.050
What's up with that sound up park to their lab at the University of Utah within

230
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:20.150
Yellowstone is a Caldera or volcano whole 50 miles across so big.

231
00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:23.930
You can't see it from the ground.

232
00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:29.260
A little below the surface as a pool of molten rock called magma cause shoulder.

233
00:14:29.521 --> 00:14:34.490
In this 60 minutes graphic,
he from the magma drives yellow stones.

234
00:14:34.491 --> 00:14:39.491
Geysers such as old faithful researchers use the seismic waves from earthquakes

235
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.630
like the x rays to see the magma underground.

236
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.920
<v 0>By the way,
hold on.
Sorry.</v>

237
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.840
It's two and a half times larger than that guy fucking freaks me out.

238
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:51.000
Just by the way,
Tom,

239
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.170
talking about mad my dad was,

240
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.890
he mentioned if the guy was over your house and be like,
oh my God,

241
00:14:57.891 --> 00:14:59.150
I have a crazy person on my house.

242
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.410
Look how they're talking to me for dad or this is where the volcanoes going to

243
00:15:04.411 --> 00:15:09.270
kill us all.
She,
you wanted to make the volcano under Yellowstone.

244
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:13.130
He's much more animated.
He's like the worst like fourth grade teacher ever.

245
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.730
The science teacher to potential is 2000 times the force of Mount Saint Helens.

246
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.240
This is a new study from the University of Utah.

247
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:28.460
The Hot Molten Brock between Yellowstone beneath Yellowstone is two and a half

248
00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:31.970
times larger than previously estimated.
Oh my God.

249
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.510
I watched a doom and gloom documentary on Yellowstone that freaked me out about

250
00:15:35.511 --> 00:15:39.920
seven years ago and now they've got new findings and it's twice as bad as they

251
00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:42.410
thought it was.
Oh,
what is this

252
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.010
<v 4>styles and years ago?</v>

253
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.360
No one knows if or when it will erupt again,

254
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.790
but if it does,
it'll be big.

255
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.800
Ash comes all the way to salt lake or Denver researchers think Dell see the

256
00:15:55.801 --> 00:15:59.430
eruption coming and we believe we'd have a bit of warning if there was going to

257
00:15:59.431 --> 00:16:00.780
be a volcanic eruption at Yellowstone.

258
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:06.060
<v 0>Three seconds.
All of I'm,
yeah,
I'm going somewhere.</v>

259
00:16:06.061 --> 00:16:08.940
I don't know where I'm going,
but I'm going somewhere.
I think Australia,

260
00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.900
that's a good one.
That's a beautiful prison colony.
They're nice people.

261
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:18.330
They like to party.
They're smart.
[inaudible] smart country.
If this happens,

262
00:16:18.331 --> 00:16:21.970
is it going to trigger the big one here?
That's something to think about it.

263
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.830
That doesn't matter,
man.
Do you understand how big this is?
But this fucker blows.

264
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.430
It's like from what that guy said,
he said to be like 50 miles across,

265
00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:33.390
but I've read that it's much larger than that I need for volcano.
Yeah.
Yeah.

266
00:16:33.391 --> 00:16:35.060
I read that it was like the,

267
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:39.000
the entire base of the crater was something nutty like 300 kilometers,

268
00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.450
like something insane that apparently if this thing blows,

269
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:47.430
it kills most of the animals on the continent and it's not just going to be like

270
00:16:47.431 --> 00:16:49.500
an issue for people that live around Yellowstone.

271
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.720
It's going to be an issue for people that live in Portugal.

272
00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:53.580
It's going to be be an issue for China.

273
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.200
It's going to be an issue for the whole planet.

274
00:16:55.210 --> 00:17:00.210
It'll cause like a giant cloud that will cover the sky and probably kill off

275
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.400
like a lot of people and animals.

276
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:07.200
It's probably going to kill most people that kill off gluten won't kill off

277
00:17:07.201 --> 00:17:12.090
sugar gluten or Kale,
Italy.
Yeah.
You can't buy any more organic.

278
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.490
Oh God.
There'll be no organic.

279
00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:17.880
Everything will be done in these things underground with light bulbs.

280
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.250
Everything will be nuclear power.
Yeah.

281
00:17:20.251 --> 00:17:24.180
Fake light on nuclear power where I'll be living underground cave pirates.

282
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.420
Well this is a bunch of fucking be but we Dunkin interviewed this guy for the

283
00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:29.910
Scifi show where he went and talked to,

284
00:17:29.911 --> 00:17:34.911
this dude has got this organized retreat underground and doomsday layer.

285
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.690
Think it was Utah.
Yeah.

286
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.770
I forget where it was but homeboy had like you drove into it.

287
00:17:40.771 --> 00:17:41.880
It was like a bomb shelter.

288
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.470
He drove into it with buses and you know these tunnels and then they had like

289
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.760
oxygen machines and they were setting like a whole colony in there where they

290
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:54.000
were going to grow food.
This is where they're going to store their supplies.

291
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.090
This is where they were going to have their like recreation room and they're

292
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.560
going to have a daycare there.

293
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.300
Like this one dude was I I think basically thinking about like getting together

294
00:18:03.301 --> 00:18:05.910
a group of women and fucking them all and killing off the husbands.

295
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.770
I think that's not a cult leader.
I'm just a guy with a bomb shelter.
Come on.

296
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.580
Who doesn't have a good bomb shelter these days?
That's the best way,
ladies,

297
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:17.070
come on in.
If you were right though,

298
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:20.520
like the dudes who want to be a cult leaders be so psyched for the apocalypse.

299
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.510
I can walk.
Yeah.
Now I'm running shit.
No more law.

300
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.750
There's no more rules.
The Internet's down.
Fuck yeah,

301
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.980
I can trick these Dominican where this eyepatch and look hardcore.
It was hard.

302
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:36.870
It's hard as fuck to trick people in 2014 you know,
if you,
you go,
you know,

303
00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:39.660
making some shit up and starting some new religion and then they go,

304
00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:43.140
well let me Google searches guy and you go him.
He's a fucking con man.

305
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.230
You know that.
That's not going to go far.
But like,
you know,

306
00:18:46.231 --> 00:18:50.400
Joseph Smith was a con man.
Joseph Smith was a con man and he started Mormonism.

307
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.190
If,
if that,
if you tried to do that today,
people would be like,
dude,

308
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:55.350
I googled you last night.
Yeah.
Fuck off.

309
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.340
That's the best response to anything googled you to fuck off.

310
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.610
I know what you tell you.
You're all bullshit,
man.
You can find a golden tablets,

311
00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:07.530
the branch Davidians and the,
yeah,
those guys.
Well,
the Waco one,

312
00:19:07.531 --> 00:19:10.860
it's really spooky because the government killed those people.
And you know,

313
00:19:10.861 --> 00:19:14.850
I mean,
I've been there.
I,
yeah,
I don't know if it's a,
I mean,

314
00:19:14.851 --> 00:19:18.810
I don't know if they attacked first.
I don't know what the exact situation was,

315
00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:22.440
but I know they lied about what they did because they wrote over those buildings

316
00:19:22.441 --> 00:19:27.030
with tanks and shot fire until those buildings like tear gas and stuff.

317
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.600
Yeah.
You could see the videos of it.
There's a,
there's a,

318
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:35.010
I think it's called rules of engagement.
Is that what it is?
That's about me.

319
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.330
Make sure that that's what it is.

320
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.350
I think that's the documentary of engagement.

321
00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:41.880
<v 5>Okay.</v>

322
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.480
<v 0>But it's all about Waco.
It's about what the,
yeah,
that's,
yeah.</v>

323
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.230
<v 5>Okay.</v>

324
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.730
<v 0>Um,
but those,
I mean,
they were definitely fucking crazy people.</v>

325
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.530
Waco,
the rules of engagement.

326
00:19:54.531 --> 00:19:58.640
That's the name of the documentary you can find it on now.
It's on Youtube,

327
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.990
the full version of it.
It's on youtube.
So just Google Waco.
WAAC.
Oh.

328
00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:06.830
And if you're interested in watching it,
it's pretty fucking interesting,
man.
Um,

329
00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.200
they put think it's creepy.
I've been there.

330
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.360
They killed the fuck out of those people.
You know,

331
00:20:11.361 --> 00:20:13.700
they've got guns and they have,
uh,
the,

332
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.010
the foundation of the building and it says,
uh,

333
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.250
the most televised massacre in the world.
And it shows it's spray paints,

334
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.660
like arrows in each direction on the tablet,
on the foundation where it's like,

335
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.320
oh,
CNN was here and you know,
Fox News was here.

336
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:32.180
Like how it was all televised for everyone to see.
Yeah.
That is what happened.

337
00:20:32.181 --> 00:20:35.390
They massacred those people and they did it right in front of everybody.

338
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.840
It's really interesting.
I mean,
it was a 51 day siege,

339
00:20:38.841 --> 00:20:43.360
and at the end of the 51 days they were like,
he fucking nef.
Yeah.
What's,

340
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:48.160
it's fascinating because I can't side with that dude.
You know,

341
00:20:48.161 --> 00:20:51.820
I can't side with Koresh.
You know,
he's obviously,
it was a cult leader.

342
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:54.310
He's obviously one of those charismatic Weirdos.
Yeah.

343
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.300
What's fucking all the women he was having sex with all the women and the kids

344
00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:03.010
too.
Some of the kids.
Oh,
I don't know if that's true.
Kids having kids.
Oh,

345
00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:05.350
Jesus Christ.
So I'm not,

346
00:21:05.351 --> 00:21:08.290
I'm not saying that he was a great guy and he's just still be around.

347
00:21:08.291 --> 00:21:09.124
Running is called,

348
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:13.750
but the way to handle it might not be smashing buildings,

349
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.340
tanks for the approver with a tanker in canning and cooking kids.
I mean,

350
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:20.620
they cooked everybody.
Yeah,
they knocked him victim,

351
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:23.500
but they killed everybody that was in that.
They had tunnels down there too.

352
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:27.650
They had tunnels underground and all that.
So they smoked them all out and yeah.

353
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.310
How many people died at Waco?

354
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:36.660
Wake up happy Tuesday.
I say,
Oh,
Dad,

355
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.820
I'm going to say a hundred and say more.

356
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:41.210
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

357
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.550
<v 0>Siri.
How many people died in Waco?
I'm sorry,
who?
What?</v>

358
00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.510
What?
Stop creeping me out.
Joe Broken 76 Oh,

359
00:21:50.511 --> 00:21:53.530
76 yeah,
that's a lot of,
I thought more.
Yeah.

360
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:57.620
Do you imagine 76 bodies stacked up on top of each other?
No,
not really,

361
00:21:57.621 --> 00:22:00.650
man.
That is crazy.

362
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:04.580
The ATF failed to raid the compound,
so the FBI jumped in,

363
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.270
so apparently they'd been shooting back and forth at each other.
Yeah,

364
00:22:08.271 --> 00:22:12.050
I remember that.
Oh God,
I remember seeing that in the,
in the windows and stuff.

365
00:22:12.051 --> 00:22:14.160
She can't shoot at the cops dummy.
Yeah.

366
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.880
In my culture can mean that's,
that's uh,

367
00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:22.250
there's a certain amount of bullshit they're not going to tolerate.

368
00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.850
You can't shoot a cop.
That's what did we go wrong?
That's where they,

369
00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.650
it's really fucking roll over your buildings tanks.
That's when they did that.

370
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.150
It's interesting because,
uh,
I had seen like Bill Hicks,

371
00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:37.100
she used to have a bid on it.
You know,
about,
uh,
the,
the United States.

372
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:42.200
We're liars and murderers because you could watch the video of them rolling

373
00:22:42.201 --> 00:22:47.020
tanks through these buildings.
Billowing fire out of the end of the tanks.

374
00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.490
And it wasn't like a funny bit,
it was more like,
you know,

375
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:55.370
he had some bits that were really just sort of a,
who's showing you like,
like,

376
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.350
like,
this is what you're dealing with.

377
00:22:57.351 --> 00:23:00.380
These are the kinds of thugs you're dealing with.
Yeah.
They,
they blew fire.

378
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:03.290
But then you look at the other side and you know,
well,
they're shooting at cops.

379
00:23:03.291 --> 00:23:07.370
Yeah.
They're fucking kids.
Uh,
the guy plays a really shitty guitar.
Yeah.

380
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.680
He just liked to party.
She knows.
Yeah,

381
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:13.130
he's banging everybody's wife and he's got guns and he shoots at cops and

382
00:23:13.131 --> 00:23:17.810
they're like,
oh right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Run him over.
All right.
What about the kids?

383
00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.180
Kids are gonna grow up to be assholes.
Yeah.
Good point.

384
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:25.430
Little inbred misfit fraggled.
Have you ever seen him sing?
Pull up David Koresh,

385
00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:29.510
David Koresh singing David Koresh.

386
00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.800
David Koresh sings the blues and all new time-life classic.

387
00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:38.390
Let's see if you can see yourself the worst moments of your life.

388
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:43.700
Could you see yourself falling for any of this bullshit now,

389
00:23:43.701 --> 00:23:44.630
that's what I call,

390
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.940
I just want him to have like an album release party.

391
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:55.280
Put aside what you know or think you know about David Koresh.

392
00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:00.760
Listen to his words recorded just before his death.
No,

393
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:05.150
and the death of his entire family.
Oh,
they have a video of him.

394
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.070
How many of us have said the same thing?
Pull this up.

395
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:14.780
David Koresh tells the Truth About Waco.
This is a video of them.

396
00:24:14.781 --> 00:24:16.630
Right before the,

397
00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.850
the Fed stormed the building and cooked everybody.

398
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.860
What was the most entertaining thing Waco has ever seen it?
I'm sure.
Well,
um,

399
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:25.731
you know,

400
00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:28.640
a lot of people went down there when the standoff was going on and they were

401
00:24:28.641 --> 00:24:32.330
like hanging out with the cops,
like watching.
It was a spectacle,

402
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:34.940
which is fucking really odd,

403
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.000
especially when you find out how it turned out.
Yeah.

404
00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.780
Like that's what you're actually watching.
You got it again.
David Koresh.

405
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.190
David Koresh tells the Truth About Waco.
Okay.

406
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:50.390
It's a him inside the branch.
Davidian I mean it's,

407
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.730
it's really creepy because he,

408
00:24:52.731 --> 00:24:56.450
I think he'd already been shot by the time they did this.
Listen to his words,

409
00:24:56.451 --> 00:24:59.970
according just before his death and the death of his entire family.

410
00:24:59.971 --> 00:25:04.280
She's just so dramatic.
How many of us have said the same thing?

411
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.063
<v 6>No.</v>

412
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.690
I guess to buy a firearm,

413
00:25:11.691 --> 00:25:16.070
it's not against the law because to buy anything to say selling a gun show

414
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.830
and one,
this is all resolved,
you know,
hey,

415
00:25:21.831 --> 00:25:23.120
yellow seed is illegal.

416
00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.040
Accusation is not,

417
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:34.490
I can't listen to it around here.
I'll tell you what,
being an American first,

418
00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:40.310
I'm the kind of guy and I,
I'll stand in front of a tank.
You can run over me,

419
00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.860
then I'll be back more than the track.
No one's going to hurt me or my family.

420
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.110
The American policy here,

421
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.113
<v 0>he's awesome.</v>

422
00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.210
<v 6>There's road.
You could have arrested me going to town or going to Walmart.</v>

423
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:55.343
Walmart.

424
00:25:55.540 --> 00:26:00.540
Michael is going to bear witness against the ATS and the two ages across the

425
00:26:00.601 --> 00:26:04.830
street over here.
Uh,
Robert Gonzalez.

426
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.360
I love the guy.
I was honest with him.
I brought him into my home.

427
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.330
He was going to stay there for two weeks.
All of this stuff you may eat,

428
00:26:12.331 --> 00:26:16.960
guys may want to avoid and deny,
you know,
you know,

429
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.380
he wanted a tour around the place.
I promised him a tour.

430
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.650
He could have talked to any of these guys around here.
Anybody.

431
00:26:22.651 --> 00:26:24.630
He was free to come and go as he chose.

432
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:30.390
And I do not appreciate it and never will I ever appreciate somebody coming here

433
00:26:30.391 --> 00:26:35.391
with two helicopters in cow cow and trailers and all that and uh,

434
00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:37.560
pushing people around with guns.
He,

435
00:26:37.561 --> 00:26:41.010
I'll meet you at the doorstep any day and you know,

436
00:26:41.011 --> 00:26:43.500
and somebody will get hurt if you want to keep playing that game.

437
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.110
I'm talking to you,

438
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.760
nobody's going to get hurt because let's say in America anymore with ATF has

439
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:55.761
that kind of power become into anybody's home and Keith doors down and things

440
00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:59.020
like that.
I heard,

441
00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:01.110
I do understand that someone reminded me of this.

442
00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:06.111
I do understand that one of the officer says gun went off on accident and then

443
00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.640
you know,
that was just like a signal and all that,
you know,

444
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:13.560
but look beside the point ATS,
he pours the wrong

445
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:19.500
practices.
Your habits.
Yeah,
drug dealers,
fine.

446
00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.220
You know,
but even there's always a question.

447
00:27:23.221 --> 00:27:28.221
If there's any question whatsoever that kids are women or as Bob Damn you,

448
00:27:28.651 --> 00:27:31.580
I tell you why you keep your damn gun and your whole shirt.

449
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:37.400
You see the couple of big brave is burstable kind of and you must him knock on

450
00:27:37.531 --> 00:27:39.120
the door,
30 food,
Bam.

451
00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.860
Involved to where they can risk their lives for the name of the wall and send

452
00:27:43.861 --> 00:27:48.330
them my bulletproof.
Put them in some kind of Vibe,
knight armor or ever.

453
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.120
I let him knock on the door and ask the questions.
First

454
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:57.870
One's going to expect me when they come busted on my door with guns drawn and

455
00:27:58.171 --> 00:27:59.100
pointing in the air.

456
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.970
It's the one part of me that I'm going to lay down and die for anybody.

457
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.030
This is then going to happen in this country.

458
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.570
<v 0>No,
it's fucked.
It's like part of what he's saying,</v>

459
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:12.920
like you shouldn't come in to people's houses with if you have any questions,

460
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:16.760
guns drawn.
If there's women and children.
He's like,
that makes a good point.
Yeah.

461
00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.240
Like why not wear like a bulletproof outfit?
Yeah.

462
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.150
Wouldn't that be like a more,
you know,

463
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.670
have a bunch of people with bulletproof Halfords don't storm into the house with

464
00:28:25.671 --> 00:28:30.140
fucking guns with kids and look,
he's obviously a redneck.
He's Kenny powers.
Yeah,

465
00:28:30.141 --> 00:28:33.420
he looks,
yeah,
he definitely loves Walmart.
He's Kenny powers.

466
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:37.780
He gets the candy powers evangelists is,
he gets a,

467
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.120
here's the question,
man.
Okay.
What if a guy,
let's say there's some guy,

468
00:28:42.121 --> 00:28:45.680
some slick talking guy and he finds some sad girls and the two girls live with

469
00:28:45.681 --> 00:28:49.190
them.
Any,
any has this like Harem of these two girls.
There's two girlfriends.

470
00:28:49.191 --> 00:28:52.610
It takes them everywhere and then make a show of it.
Shoe Hugh Hefner style.
Yeah.

471
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.930
Yeah.
Like he's kissing them all out in public.
All right.
That's okay.

472
00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:00.800
But I just,
I think you pitched a show for Bravo right now.

473
00:29:00.801 --> 00:29:03.050
I think that's actually really cause a new show.

474
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:07.250
This guy moves in with two girls.
They're lost.
They're lost and sad.

475
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:12.050
They can't afford food.
Yeah.
So this Guy Mike,
a racist,

476
00:29:12.051 --> 00:29:14.180
their memories.
But you know what I'm saying?

477
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:18.490
What I'm saying is like when does it become a cult?
Okay.
If,
if you're got,

478
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.530
if you've got two gals,
that's okay.
Everybody's like,
well,

479
00:29:21.531 --> 00:29:24.530
it's just an eccentric lifestyle.
Okay,
but what does she amorous right.

480
00:29:24.531 --> 00:29:26.990
That's what I call a polyamorous.
But if you have 30 of them,
yeah.

481
00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.500
And it's you and your five friends and you all swap wives and you live in a

482
00:29:30.501 --> 00:29:32.480
place and your gun enthusiasts,
then you're,

483
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.090
then you're getting into the learning channel right now.
That's,

484
00:29:35.091 --> 00:29:38.150
that's exactly what that is.
That's all.
I mean,
I'm patient,

485
00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:41.230
I'm thinking shows and I'm like,
oh,
those dollar signs,
Joe,

486
00:29:41.231 --> 00:29:45.070
we've got two days to live before the magma piles up on our bodies.

487
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.400
Money's not worth anything anymore.
You need bitcoins.
I don't know.

488
00:29:48.401 --> 00:29:53.050
That is an interesting thing where it's like that.
It's like the um,
God,

489
00:29:53.051 --> 00:29:56.220
where is that?
I was,
we were driving by that place.
It's like,
I,
um,

490
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.800
it is like a Mormon or,

491
00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:02.830
or one of those big love plots where everything's boarded up.

492
00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:08.080
They have no outlet to society.
Like I just,
when do you,
when do you,

493
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:12.400
when do you go?
Hmm,
this sounds like a great idea.
As long as it's old,
it's okay.

494
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:16.500
It can be very cold.
Like it could be like the Amish where they're like bakers.

495
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:21.670
They were,
Quakers are fine as long as it's old.
But if it's like creepy,
well,

496
00:30:21.671 --> 00:30:26.000
no,
the Amish are creepy.
Well,
you know,
you've used electricity.
That's creepy.

497
00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:29.980
Make their own butter.
That's so cute.
That is kind of cute.
It's kind of cute.

498
00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.540
But their outfits are ridiculous.

499
00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:34.710
That's really done massive restriction on their activities.
Um,

500
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.970
but there've been around a long time so it's okay.

501
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.610
But if like Justin Martin Dale decided to start the,

502
00:30:39.611 --> 00:30:42.910
the Martindale's and this is your new a religion.

503
00:30:42.911 --> 00:30:44.920
The religion of the Martindale aliens.
Yeah.

504
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.870
Dress up like they're a band member and Divo you know,

505
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:53.080
if I can have like a bunch of specific shit you make them all do.

506
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:57.130
Then everyone lives in this gated community that fucking feds would come and

507
00:30:57.131 --> 00:30:59.640
knock on your door.
Where are you getting the ECC?

508
00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.960
What ECC we talking to talking about it.
I'm just grinding my teeth.
I love it.

509
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:07.150
I'm hydrating though.
Hey,
I pay taxes,
get the fuck off me.
Next thing you know,

510
00:31:07.151 --> 00:31:09.280
you'd be getting arrested,
be having too much fun.

511
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.430
But if it was just you living with a couple of dudes,

512
00:31:12.431 --> 00:31:14.530
partying it up all the time,
no one would say shit.

513
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.340
If three guys share a house and they just have parties all the time and they

514
00:31:18.341 --> 00:31:22.210
like to go dancing and they like to eat and go drink and bring people home and

515
00:31:22.211 --> 00:31:25.270
have more parties,
nobody gives a fuck.
Yeah,
that's just called Palm Springs.

516
00:31:25.271 --> 00:31:28.450
Exactly.
Yeah.
That's a house.
It's fine.
It's nothing wrong with it.

517
00:31:28.451 --> 00:31:30.220
As long as your neighbors don't freak the fuck out.

518
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.980
But once the neighbors freak out.

519
00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:37.450
But if you have 50 guys and they all lived in like these five houses that you

520
00:31:37.451 --> 00:31:41.050
had fenced in,
sure.
That will be a real issue.
You know,

521
00:31:41.051 --> 00:31:45.490
there's 10 guys in each house and they're all,
they grow their own food.
Oh.
Oh,

522
00:31:45.491 --> 00:31:49.600
that's weird.
Oh these fucks.
They have solar backups.

523
00:31:49.601 --> 00:31:52.020
They have generators there.
They seem to be digging a well,

524
00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.160
oh we've got to fucking stop this.
Say Anti American.

525
00:31:54.161 --> 00:31:56.620
And they try and do is try and get off the grid.
Huh?
Were you doing anything?

526
00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.400
Hey Fox tried to be self sustaining growing their own weed.
Oh No.

527
00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:02.140
Probably that's what everybody looks for.

528
00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.740
That's what everyone's doing these days.
There's a great story about these uh,

529
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.100
CIA agents that got,
uh,

530
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:11.080
arrested because of the DEA thought that they were growing weed and they were

531
00:32:11.081 --> 00:32:12.840
actually growing tomatoes.
That's funny.

532
00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.140
They'd go by their house with those scanners.
Oh,
to pick up the,

533
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.500
to pick up the scent or something?
No,
the scanner,
they have those in Denver now,

534
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.910
but apparently they're being ruled unconstitutional or there's some sort of a

535
00:32:24.911 --> 00:32:25.990
dispute about them now.

536
00:32:25.991 --> 00:32:30.991
These are some things that they use outside to find out how much electricity

537
00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:33.500
that the house is using.
Oh,
I see.
If like you,

538
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:38.470
you have like a series of glow lights or grow grow lights,
rather,

539
00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.380
it'll give off a very specific signal outside the house.

540
00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:44.150
Like they can find out if you're growing things.

541
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.510
So they knew these guys were growing thanks to,

542
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.310
they came in broken in their house and found that they have fucking tomato.

543
00:32:49.311 --> 00:32:53.180
They're using those lights for the tomato plants.
Yeah.
It was just so bored now.

544
00:32:53.181 --> 00:32:56.030
Who's growing weed?
Yeah,
I'll,
I'll,

545
00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:00.350
I'll pull up the story because it's so fucking stupid.
It hurts your brain.

546
00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:04.010
That would be amazing to be those people.
They're like their tomatoes.
Yeah,

547
00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:08.730
they have fucking,
what are you doing it,
it happens all the time,
by the way.
Um,

548
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.590
there's,
there's a bunch of stories online.
Um,
you can,

549
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:16.550
you can find them all over the place where people were busted from growing

550
00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:19.070
tomatoes.
Um,
my sister,
my,

551
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.950
my brother in law was growing tomatoes in the basement.
I mean,

552
00:33:21.951 --> 00:33:24.020
people do it all the time.
Especially in the east coast.

553
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.590
You have a piece of your basement,
you set up some lights,
you can have food.

554
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:29.030
Now why wouldn't you do it?

555
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:33.920
But this is a funny fucking story because it's two former CIA employees and

556
00:33:33.921 --> 00:33:38.921
they're in Kansas and their home was broken down and searched for a in a two

557
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:44.090
state drug sweep claim.
They were illegally.
That's hilarious.

558
00:33:44.091 --> 00:33:48.380
So they were Xca and homeless?
No.
What are you talking about?

559
00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:52.380
The homeless.
Oh,
no,
no.
There was,

560
00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.640
their home was invaded.
I was like,
these,

561
00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.170
these are just homeless people invading someone's house.
That's awesome.

562
00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:03.350
This is how stupid this idea of the drug war is.
And this war on plants,

563
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.490
their operation,
the operation was operation constant gardener.

564
00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:13.220
Yeah.
The aborigine of Gardner.
Yeah.
If people are growing plants,

565
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:17.300
is it okay to grow things?
No.
No.
It's not.
Stop creating life.
No,
it's not.

566
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:20.900
We decided it's not operation,
home and garden.
So we will,

567
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.860
we will most think about all the different things you can grow that aren't

568
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:28.010
illegal.
Okay.
And then if you're growing something,

569
00:34:28.011 --> 00:34:32.270
we assume it's illegal and we have the right to break down your fucking door.

570
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:37.310
We've lost a lot of rights folks.
We've lost a lot of rights.
That's,

571
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:41.090
that's really weird.
It's really weird.

572
00:34:41.091 --> 00:34:45.680
I mean these dummies are doing this to ex CIA agents.
God,

573
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:50.210
we found plants.
Tomatoes.
Yeah.

574
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:54.890
It's fucking stupid,
man.
It's a stupid,
stupid,

575
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:58.670
stupid situation.
Yeah.
Fucking dumb asses.

576
00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.760
That's why he used to grow my weed underneath my waterbed like the Florida.

577
00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:04.850
Of course you did.
It doesn't matter.
It's still fine.

578
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:10.910
Like we had enough room.
You'd have the shittiest we'd ever,
it's much farts to

579
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:17.360
waterbeds and farts.
I always liked the way waterbed smell though.

580
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.330
They're weird to sleeping man.
Cause they like a womb.

581
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.020
I had to go when I lived in Boston.
Is there bad for fucking though?

582
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.800
The only way you get a good fuck on a waterbed is you've got to get in a corner.

583
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:29.720
That makes sense for race,
your legs,

584
00:35:29.721 --> 00:35:34.160
one leg on each side and you gotta you gotta figure out how to ride going

585
00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.280
sloshing.
Yeah.
Just cause it's gotta be sloshing.

586
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.260
Even if you have those waterbeds and have baffles in them.

587
00:35:40.261 --> 00:35:42.690
Like a lot of them have baffles in them so they only wiggle a little.

588
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.250
It's not quite the same.
Once you get a good fuck on and like a real solid bed,

589
00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:51.300
a bed like a tempurpedic one,
it's got a good fucking give to it.

590
00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.660
Cause their tempurpedic.
Waterbeds no it was tempurpedic bed.
Regular beds.

591
00:35:54.661 --> 00:35:56.880
You don't even pay attention to anything you think is hot pilots.
No,

592
00:35:56.881 --> 00:35:59.790
I don't think about putting together shows.
That would be amazing.

593
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:00.630
That'd be the best bet ever.

594
00:36:00.631 --> 00:36:03.030
Cause I'm thinking waterbeds are the most uncomfortable bad's ever.

595
00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:07.680
They are awesome.
I had a bad water bad.
That was just me then.

596
00:36:07.681 --> 00:36:10.120
Well uncomfortable to you.
How about that?
Yeah.

597
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:13.230
Was it one of those ones that you sink right to the middle?
Yeah.
Yeah.

598
00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:16.430
Those are the problems.
That's what we were talking about,
like baffles,
you know,

599
00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:19.730
baffles meaning there's a bunch of different compartments.
It's still a waterbed,

600
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.120
but there's many different compartments.

601
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:24.330
Not just one big one that the wiggles around.
There's like,
you know,

602
00:36:24.331 --> 00:36:28.110
hundreds of them.
So you sit in it and you would just wiggle.
Just sort of a,

603
00:36:28.111 --> 00:36:31.930
just a tiny little wiggle just tiny little bit.
But um,

604
00:36:31.931 --> 00:36:33.830
the heat off of the waterbed,

605
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:38.610
it's what's fascinating because it gives you this weird like deep sleep feeling

606
00:36:38.611 --> 00:36:41.760
like you're being like you're in a wool Lincoln.
Yeah,
in Utero,

607
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.000
but I fucked up once and my heater stopped or something.

608
00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:46.530
I don't remember it a long time ago.

609
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.560
But you get so fucking hole if you're sleeping over a waterbed and the heater

610
00:36:52.441 --> 00:36:57.000
breaks you like you could get like hypothermia,
tannic shit.
Yeah.
It fucking,

611
00:36:57.001 --> 00:36:59.550
you freeze your Dick off.
Like I'm sitting there going,

612
00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:02.250
I can't believe how fucking cold this.
It's like,
I thought it'd be fine.

613
00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.630
I didn't realize that.
No,

614
00:37:03.631 --> 00:37:06.390
the water is going to like suck the heat out of your body.

615
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:10.050
It's not like it's not warm anymore.
You just wake up blue.
If you wake up,

616
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.310
it's not like a mattress,

617
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.520
like a mattress is the temperature of the room and that's fine,

618
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:18.480
but you can't have a waterbed,
the temperature of the room,
the waterbed,

619
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:22.560
it's 70 degrees.
You're fuck yeah,
I want a warm bed and he don't warrant that

620
00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:24.550
popped.

621
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:28.190
My cat ended up popping mine and I woke up and into the water I was with a girl

622
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.130
on the water.
Just started coming up.
That's a weird way to wake up.
You're like,

623
00:37:32.131 --> 00:37:36.300
are you picking on me and cats?
Silly cat.
I popped a water bed wants,

624
00:37:36.301 --> 00:37:38.940
that's a disaster,
man.
It's a disaster.

625
00:37:38.941 --> 00:37:42.150
And you got to fucking do something quick because the apartment is going to fill

626
00:37:42.151 --> 00:37:44.070
up with water and it's going to go through the floor.

627
00:37:44.071 --> 00:37:47.160
And if you're above somebody there,
you know they're full of shit.
Ah,

628
00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:52.320
where are you?
Where are you above some ways.
Uh,
I was,
I mean,
I was above someone,

629
00:37:52.321 --> 00:37:55.980
but it didn't get that bad.
I took care of it before it went crazy.
That's scary.

630
00:37:55.981 --> 00:37:56.940
I don't even remember how,

631
00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:00.660
I don't remember what the process of draining it was and it's like a Tan,

632
00:38:00.661 --> 00:38:03.320
attach a hose and get the hose and carry it to the Sangamon,

633
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:07.500
siphon it and then pour it in or something.
I don't even remember the full,
full,

634
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:11.280
full boat of issues,
but I remember when I got a regular bad after that,

635
00:38:11.281 --> 00:38:13.320
I was like,
fuck waterbeds man,

636
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:17.340
this is what a bed's supposed to be like silly goddamn gimmick bed.

637
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:21.240
Do they still make water bed sores?
They do fight anybody.

638
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.350
I'm going to Google dope waterbed.
It's just got a waterbeds and stuff.

639
00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:29.430
They have those ones with a like fishing them now and shit.
Yeah.

640
00:38:29.431 --> 00:38:34.320
That's ridiculous.
Bunch of fucking fish shitting over your head.
Um,
dope.

641
00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:39.190
Waterbeds waterbeds.com it doesn't have much waterbeds and stuff.

642
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:43.570
Has it.
Alternative to water beds.
Hmm.

643
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:48.790
Waterbed suggestions.
Waterbeds still making ways in Google news.
Oh,

644
00:38:48.791 --> 00:38:50.170
that was clever.
How they said that.

645
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.750
My bed still making waves on my recent trip to Florida.

646
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:56.471
Of course,

647
00:38:56.471 --> 00:39:01.471
flora picked up the Sarasota Herald Tribune one day and started to flip through

648
00:39:02.231 --> 00:39:05.710
it.
[inaudible] I stopped at,
uh,
shut the fuck up.

649
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:08.080
Boring the piss out of shitty writer

650
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:14.890
fucking dummy.
What if it was the guy who was,
he was narrating the magma thing.

651
00:39:14.891 --> 00:39:16.750
He was like,
Oh,
I bought this water bad.

652
00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.070
There's a guy named waterbed who's on Twitter or a tumbler.

653
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.500
<v 7>Okay.</v>

654
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.770
<v 0>Oh,
it's waterbeds on Tumbler.
Yeah.</v>

655
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.610
So they still make them and they have that what you were talking about Justin,

656
00:39:28.611 --> 00:39:33.610
what it looks like with a foam on top,
the tempurpedic.
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

657
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.970
But see how it has all those layers to it.
Yeah.
That's how they do it.

658
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.840
Just like the Earth's crust.
Oh No.
Back to yellow stone going to die.

659
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:47.410
Waterbeds and magma to what if this shit is like awesome.
Now we should try it.

660
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.830
I would like to try it right now.
I want to try a tempurpedic waterbed.

661
00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.470
It's like sleeping in like a little like hot pocket.
Like a little sandwich.

662
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:57.040
That's probably would be pretty good.
Yeah,
it's the warmth of the water bed.

663
00:39:57.041 --> 00:40:01.960
That's really awesome.
Yeah.
Especially when you live in a cold place.
Which,
uh,

664
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:05.320
I was in Chicago one weekend and then New York last weekend.
Cool.

665
00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:08.800
Goddamn you appreciate La when you get back from that.
Yeah.
You're like,

666
00:40:08.801 --> 00:40:12.250
isn't it an amazing what we don't have to deal with?
Yeah.
You don't have to like,

667
00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:15.550
yeah,
freeze or eat your grandma's.
But you know,

668
00:40:15.551 --> 00:40:20.160
but here's the voters.
Like those fucking poor people in that house.

669
00:40:20.161 --> 00:40:22.810
His Dad alive,

670
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.820
that movie where they were trapped in the mountains and they ate it.

671
00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:29.380
They ate it with a spoon alive.
It was the soccer team wasn't it?

672
00:40:29.381 --> 00:40:32.320
Does ass cheeks atlas spoiler and ate it.
Hey,
times are tough.

673
00:40:32.321 --> 00:40:35.350
You got to eat that.
That's got to do what you gotta do.
That's it.
Good.
Maybe.

674
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:38.920
Do you know the thing about those warm climates though,

675
00:40:38.921 --> 00:40:43.310
as opposed to cold climates?
Cold climates develop cooler people,
goddammit.

676
00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:45.700
I hate saying it,
but it's fucking true.
Hmm.

677
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.510
There's something about those cold climates that like,
people,

678
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:51.310
they develop more character.
Yeah.
Well,

679
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:55.540
it kind of makes them human and like they're all in it together and they all

680
00:40:55.541 --> 00:40:58.840
know it sucks.
Yeah.
So they're like,
why are we going to,
yeah,
it's like here.

681
00:40:58.841 --> 00:41:00.520
I think it's warm.
It's always nice.

682
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:05.170
So I think people just numb to it.
Everyone's just a dick.

683
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:09.060
Everyone is just an asshole.
I just think we live in a very medicaid city too.

684
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:12.130
I don't know.
I don't know what the actual numbers.
I smell weed everywhere.

685
00:41:12.131 --> 00:41:15.310
I got that way,
man.
That's the good medicated.

686
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:20.500
I'm such a hypocrite.
I'm like,
people are just doing drugs all the time.

687
00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:24.770
Everywhere.
They're just doing all these paraphernalias.

688
00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:26.520
They're all just escaping rehab.

689
00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:29.920
Everyone Punch a week pitch each and every one of them.

690
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.160
You're talking pills.
Fucking people a week,
dude.

691
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:42.020
<v 2>Everyone's just trying to escape
the,
uh,
the,</v>

692
00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:46.510
this,
um,
this is a Xanax and a antidepressants.
It,
okay,

693
00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:49.890
game on.
Let's go.
It's a Xanax in antidepressant culture.

694
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.610
We need a little snap.
Little snow to shovel wouldn't hurt anything.

695
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:54.351
<v 8>There's one of those.</v>

696
00:41:54.351 --> 00:41:59.050
It's one of those things where I hear that every day.

697
00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:03.590
I hear Xanax or I hear Valium or I here.
What's the,
um,

698
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.160
what's the upper one?
Maggie's,
Huh?
Matthiessen overall,

699
00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:09.323
all that one.

700
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.850
I like a really good game of crazy or on meth.

701
00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:17.780
I think that's a good street game.
I play with myself.

702
00:42:17.781 --> 00:42:21.950
Like you just see people now we're just like,
and you're just like,

703
00:42:21.951 --> 00:42:24.980
what is going on?
And then you're like,
oh,
they're on math.

704
00:42:24.981 --> 00:42:29.010
I'm seeing a lot of women on meth now.
Really?
Like,
yeah,

705
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:32.240
like young girls and especially on sunset.
Whoa.

706
00:42:32.241 --> 00:42:35.470
Starts Math in 2014 amateurs.

707
00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:42.110
People that can afford
or is it people like,
man,

708
00:42:42.111 --> 00:42:47.050
I don't believe the hype.
I don't know.
I mean there was a story on it.
Uh,

709
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:51.470
there's a guy in Hollywood who does a thing like it's a like Hollywood night

710
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.310
angel program or something because a lot of kids on in Hollywood who move out

711
00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:56.660
here and you know,
they don't,

712
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:59.690
they're homeless and their dreams aren't working out,
whatever.

713
00:42:59.691 --> 00:43:03.410
They just start doing it and like this guy goes around and helps them,

714
00:43:03.411 --> 00:43:05.830
gives them shoes,
all that kind of stuff.
And he's like,
it's a,
it's a,

715
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:09.920
it's a huge epidemic in Hollywood.
And I think,
I'm pretty sure everywhere else,

716
00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:12.400
but I could never,
I could never do that.

717
00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.130
You can never do that or heroin or any of that

718
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:20.160
<v 2>stuff.
It's a huge epidemic all over the country.
Maths,
maths is a big one.</v>

719
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:23.520
[inaudible] so weird one too because um,

720
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:28.440
it's Kinda like universally accepted as being bad,
but yet it's everywhere.

721
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:32.670
<v 8>Yeah.
It's a w he had a show about it,
you know,</v>

722
00:43:32.671 --> 00:43:36.300
it's like kind of glorifying it in a weird way almost.
Right.

723
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:40.370
It was a little bit like,
it was a great,
great,
great,
don't,
don't say it

724
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:44.420
<v 2>like,
yeah,
but I mean,
in order to make an effective piece of fiction,
yeah.</v>

725
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:46.780
And I got to make it a little crazy and exciting,

726
00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:49.090
but the weird thing about methods,

727
00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:53.620
it's so God damn popular that they decided to make like fake versions of math

728
00:43:53.621 --> 00:43:56.830
and calm bath salts and sell that.
I mean,

729
00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:00.790
is that still a thing fuck yet?
Till that salts are,
yes.
Huh.

730
00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:05.560
You know why?
Because there's so many different ways they could sell things.

731
00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:10.210
They can change so many different aspects of whatever the illegal drug is.

732
00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:15.060
Like Adam oxygen molecule,
that phosphorus or whatever,
the cocktail kind of.
Yeah.

733
00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:19.990
They can add things and twist things like say if you have a very specific drug,

734
00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:22.750
like you have a new thing that you created called dunk,

735
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:25.410
you know all man who's are doing donk,
Matt Dong,

736
00:44:25.411 --> 00:44:30.411
it fucks you up and dunk is hashtag whatever the chemical composition for is.

737
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.440
If they just add and then the government makes donkey illegal.

738
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.900
If he does add an oxygen molecule dunk,

739
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:39.330
even though it still fucks you up beyond repair,

740
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:43.200
it's not donkey anymore because now it's got this other thing.

741
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.470
So chemically speaking it's a different thing.
It's Dank,

742
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:51.360
so becomes legal and then he say not for human consumption and you sell it like

743
00:44:51.361 --> 00:44:55.770
bath salts.
So that's essentially essentially what they did.
But doc,

744
00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.780
<v 0>but bath salts aren't over the counter though,
right?
You have to.
Yes,</v>

745
00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.673
they are over.

746
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.670
They used to sell them a gas stations used to be able to buy them at seven 11 no

747
00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:06.620
I don't.
I shouldn't say seven 11 I should say convenience stores.
I don't have,

748
00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.650
I don't think,
actually a matter of fact,

749
00:45:08.651 --> 00:45:13.490
I'm pretty sure seven 11 never carry any of the stores like head shops that

750
00:45:13.491 --> 00:45:17.710
synthesized
stuff.
No,
no.

751
00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:20.890
What you're thinking of is,
I dunno if you think of the synthesizer,

752
00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:25.720
you thinking about weed,
it's fake weed.
No,
no,
no.
Fake weed is just fake weed.

753
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:29.500
It's just glad there's some fake we that has like some psychoactive effect

754
00:45:29.501 --> 00:45:32.440
apparently,
but it doesn't feel like weed and it's really shitty.
Like,

755
00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:35.680
or the that's wait is horrible.
It's terrible.

756
00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:39.250
A lot of hospitals from people taking it off cause you can like,

757
00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:42.940
it messes with your head.
I,
I've taken some fake weed before.
Meanwhile,

758
00:45:42.941 --> 00:45:44.870
by the way,
there's a fucking store that's on yeah,

759
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:49.320
<v 2>the Internet about a woman in the UK that died from cannabis poisoning,
but,
huh.</v>

760
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.250
Uh Oh shit.

761
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:55.220
The idea that she's the first person to ever die from we'd ever,
and the the,

762
00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:58.480
I don't know what fucking newspaper,
it's like the Daily Mail here.

763
00:45:58.481 --> 00:46:00.340
I'll pull it up.
Woman dies from wheat.

764
00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:00.621
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

765
00:46:00.621 --> 00:46:05.450
It's supposedly she w she overdosed but she's not possible.

766
00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:10.340
She overdosed on.
Where is she in Canada.
How old was she?
She was younger.

767
00:46:10.341 --> 00:46:13.790
She was cute and uh,
yeah,
she didn't mind much,

768
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:15.650
much inner system though or something

769
00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.030
<v 2>through.
She had a heart attack.
Yeah.
She just had,</v>

770
00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.930
she had a moderate doses of marijuana in her system and she had a heart attack.

771
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:26.500
It's not that we'd killed her.
Who knows what killed her.

772
00:46:26.501 --> 00:46:29.350
She could have had some sort of an issue with her heart,
you know,

773
00:46:29.351 --> 00:46:33.840
who knows what it was.
But marijuana and takes the els when they,

774
00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:35.170
when they tested drug,

775
00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:40.560
like say if it's a acid or LSD or mushrooms or Mtma,

776
00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:47.130
they have a thing called the LD 50 and the LD 50 is lethal dose for 50% of the

777
00:46:47.201 --> 00:46:51.280
population.
So safe.
If we,
they gave all of us in this room,
you know,

778
00:46:51.281 --> 00:46:54.460
a thousand milligrams,
whatever the fuck it is.
If it kills two of us,

779
00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:58.690
that's LD 50.
That's the dosage that like 50% of people are going to fucking die.

780
00:46:58.691 --> 00:47:00.970
This is a pretty bad stuff because it doesn't kill everybody.

781
00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.470
Like you'd probably give Joey Diaz

782
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:06.810
<v 0>enough to kill all of us to come by and he would survive.</v>

783
00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.930
It doesn't work in every weeks out of the ashes.

784
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.070
But if you gave like little Esther half of what we kill us.
So we killed her.

785
00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.330
Yeah.
So lethal dose at 50% of the population were from marijuana.

786
00:47:18.331 --> 00:47:23.160
It's 1500 pounds.
Stop and think about that.
That's a lot.

787
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.410
That's a lot.
That's a lot.
Okay,
let's,

788
00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.740
let's make sure that I'm correct about that.
LD 50 of marijuana.
It's crazy.
Yeah.

789
00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:34.170
<v 1>So do you think it's this one shit coroner or whatever,
just uh,</v>

790
00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:37.450
being a retard or do you think they're trying to like push something,

791
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:42.130
you know that before just trying to make this story now,

792
00:47:42.131 --> 00:47:45.590
why am I picturing this girl like naked in the snow?
Like is that,
I don't know,

793
00:47:45.591 --> 00:47:50.050
like what she does she smoke and like wander out into the field and die.

794
00:47:50.051 --> 00:47:52.810
Or like we're shooting our apartment were,
were,
was she?

795
00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:57.310
<v 0>Listen to this,
a smoker.
Okay.
Let's the,</v>

796
00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:02.320
in order to a marijuana smoker would have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as

797
00:48:02.781 --> 00:48:07.010
much marijuana as is contained in one marijuana cigarette

798
00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:09.470
bullshit.
Canada

799
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:15.830
regular marijuana cigarette has approximately 0.9 grams.

800
00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:21.160
Smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly 1500 pounds of marijuana

801
00:48:22.881 --> 00:48:27.290
within 15 minutes to produce a lethal response.

802
00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:30.650
It's one o'clock now.
Should we start?
I can't.
I have shit to do today.

803
00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:35.270
I'm busy.
That's an all day experience of God.

804
00:48:35.271 --> 00:48:40.271
One thing you can't do is smoke 1500 pounds of marijuana and then get shit done.

805
00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:44.020
Yeah,
right.
You'd just be on Facebook.
What's all live?

806
00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:49.060
One pound of marijuana is that you could smoke 1300 pounds of marijuana in 15

807
00:48:49.821 --> 00:48:52.610
minutes.
It'd be fine.
That's what everyone's missing here.

808
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:55.760
Like if the LD 50 is 1500 pounds,

809
00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:00.140
we can probably each one of us smoke a thousand pounds safely.

810
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:04.550
We would shut down every Carl's Jr God,
you'd shut down every cell in your body.

811
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.320
You would probably transcend space and time and become a God.
You,

812
00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.430
you probably what it would be David Koresh.

813
00:49:10.431 --> 00:49:15.410
You would probably have a whole new perspective on all these guys.
I'm traveling.

814
00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:19.580
They were just a little off.
They were a little off the fucking,

815
00:49:19.581 --> 00:49:24.500
the guys who cut their dicks off down in the San Diego.
Oh,
sneakers on.

816
00:49:24.501 --> 00:49:27.320
Remember those days,
the Koolaid guns off?
Just don't,
no,
no,
no.

817
00:49:27.321 --> 00:49:29.870
Those were the Africans are,
those are the South American guys.

818
00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:33.340
That was where it was.
David Koresh.
No,

819
00:49:33.341 --> 00:49:37.420
I'm Jim Jones was in Guyana tragedy.
Yeah,
sure.

820
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:42.740
Jonestown.
Jonestown.
Yeah.
I think that was Guyana,
which is a South America,
right,

821
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.910
Diana,
hasn't it?
Uh,
either way.

822
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.740
1500 pounds.
So shut the fuck up.
That's ridiculous.

823
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:55.490
All of those people that said that it was a woman died of Canada's poisoning.

824
00:49:55.491 --> 00:49:57.790
She did not.
She data food

825
00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:01.760
<v 1>and you know,
that had to hit every single local news station and saw your mom.</v>

826
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:08.360
<v 0>Did you want to be number two?
You want to be the second child to die and leave.</v>

827
00:50:08.361 --> 00:50:11.630
Your mother,
child was raised you.

828
00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.240
You call it to me for another dimension.

829
00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.000
I brought you into this existence and I didn't do it.

830
00:50:17.001 --> 00:50:21.530
So you can be a fucking pot had called me from another dementia coming with Mama

831
00:50:21.531 --> 00:50:24.500
to church.
Come on,
let's pray.
Let's pray.

832
00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:27.730
My Lips are vibrating.

833
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:32.160
<v 8>War Cry,
mixed my lips itch.</v>

834
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:37.700
There's so many dumb fucks in this world.
Whoever put that story out,

835
00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:41.330
every one of them should be sued.
You should be sued for fraud.

836
00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:46.010
He should be sued for misrepresenting the facts.
You should be sued.
I should.

837
00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.110
You shouldn't really be sued.
So just yell at you though.

838
00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.520
And I don't want anybody sued.

839
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:51.350
I don't want anybody being dragged to the legal system.

840
00:50:51.351 --> 00:50:55.040
Even for something that's stupid.
But it is.
Dom is fuck.

841
00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:58.160
There are dumb people who remember that fire like a week ago.
The big,

842
00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:02.570
the one over.
And um,
yes.
Where was there a Glendora.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

843
00:51:02.571 --> 00:51:06.120
So this is my favorite Tom Story for the past week was that was outside.

844
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:08.690
I was like,
oh look at the sky,
because it was turning the sky pink.

845
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:11.690
It was kind of really nice.
And this girl was like,

846
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:14.770
what's going on with the thigh?
And I was like,
oh,
there's a fire in Glendora.

847
00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:19.400
She's like,
Oh,
oh.
I thought it was like another sunrise.

848
00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:24.320
And I was like,
what?
I've just looked at her.
I was like,
what?
She's like,
yeah,

849
00:51:24.321 --> 00:51:28.760
I thought the sun was rising again.
I'm like,
yeah,
cause we live on Pandora.
Dumb,

850
00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.060
dumb bitch.
God,
I was,

851
00:51:32.061 --> 00:51:36.860
I've never wanted to just rip out a throat and just say fatality more in my
life.

852
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:40.970
There's a problem with the world is that,
uh,
you making fun of this one girl,

853
00:51:40.971 --> 00:51:44.780
someone could say Justin Martin.
Dale,
you hate women.
I don't hate women.
Women.

854
00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:49.520
I adore women.
I am America's gay best friend.
He's not a tricky thing though.

855
00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.750
Isn't that tricky?
The tricky thing,
like if you bash any woman,
oh,

856
00:51:53.751 --> 00:51:56.450
I haven't told on stage that.
They're like,
oh,
you just have woman issues.

857
00:51:56.451 --> 00:51:59.280
I'm like,
no,
I don't.
I love women.
I'm bitch issues.

858
00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:04.640
Anybody can be a dumb bitch though.
Fuck yeah,
I dump cons and there you go.

859
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:07.490
If you make fun of men,
nobody ever accused you hating men.

860
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:09.050
And then a weird thing,

861
00:52:09.051 --> 00:52:12.410
I don't want to make you fucking guys ever and no one assumes you're talking

862
00:52:12.411 --> 00:52:15.030
about the entire gender.
Yeah.
But if you'd talk about,

863
00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:16.940
think everybody just knows that guys are stupid,

864
00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:25.250
guys are stupid.
Women are stupid.
Everyone is stupid.

865
00:52:25.251 --> 00:52:28.670
Can we all just be on board?
It'd be stupid.
Yeah,
there's most of us were stupid.

866
00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.800
A good chunk of the time.
Yeah.

867
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.970
I mean there's plenty of evidence of me being stupid just online.

868
00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.710
You could find it.
It's there.
I don't know.
Maybe it's just like an la thing.

869
00:52:36.711 --> 00:52:40.830
Like I find myself around town and just I,
I,
I listened to other what,

870
00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:45.230
what people are talking about.
Like,
like something we'll,

871
00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:48.020
someone will say something and I'll just,
and I'm very vocal about it.

872
00:52:48.021 --> 00:52:49.560
I was just looking,
just be like,
ah,

873
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:56.390
what's wrong with you?
God,
that's the stereotypical bitchy gay guy.

874
00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:58.090
No,
but it's not bitchy.
I'm not like,

875
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:02.710
I'm an intelligent eminent that's wrong with you.
That is,

876
00:53:02.711 --> 00:53:07.711
if she defied sound like [inaudible] my friend [inaudible] he was like,

877
00:53:09.351 --> 00:53:11.480
you were,
you were such a bitch.
Ah,

878
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:15.900
you just don't want to look at yourself objectively.
Know whatever day.

879
00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:20.390
We'll bitchy.
I can be a little bitchy when somebody says something stupid.

880
00:53:20.391 --> 00:53:22.940
I'm going to say I'm going to call it out.
I don't know.

881
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.070
I think I'm just being very blunt.
If that makes me bitch than fine.
Well,
it's

882
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.480
<v 0>a good thing to do occasionally,</v>

883
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:32.340
but it's also a good thing to just internalize and laugh at.
I do that too.

884
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:34.400
You could have two different reactions and do,

885
00:53:34.401 --> 00:53:37.440
you can be around someone who's saying really annoying shit and just focus on it

886
00:53:37.441 --> 00:53:42.000
and get fucking crazy and go Jesus Christ.
Or You could just go,
yeah.

887
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:45.210
Sometimes I'll sit back and laugh at it just because it is pretty amazing.

888
00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:49.560
Human folly is some of the funniest shit like that.

889
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:53.100
Just it's been around forever.
We were talking about Kenny powers yesterday,

890
00:53:53.101 --> 00:53:54.150
how funny that character,

891
00:53:54.151 --> 00:53:58.980
that character is because it's so subtle and close to reality and we almost

892
00:53:58.981 --> 00:54:00.510
David Koresh lives in a way.

893
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:05.790
That's one of the reasons why it's so funny because human like Hubris and folly,

894
00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:08.610
it's like,
and people be just being dumb asses.

895
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:12.430
Some of the most amusing stuff for us because we can relate.
Yeah.

896
00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:15.480
I think especially now with like technology,

897
00:54:15.481 --> 00:54:19.050
I just think everyone's just a little brain dead inside now.
You know?

898
00:54:19.051 --> 00:54:23.460
It's like everyone's on their phones.
Everyone's,
you know,
I look around,

899
00:54:23.461 --> 00:54:26.370
like I'll go to a restaurant or something and I'll see like a whole family on

900
00:54:26.371 --> 00:54:30.540
their phone and it just blows my mind.
I'm just like,
wow,
I'll see kids.

901
00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:35.160
I'll see like three year olds with iPads and iPhone fives and stuff and I'm just

902
00:54:35.161 --> 00:54:35.970
like,
whoa.

903
00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:40.230
Did you see that history in pictures thing that was going around the Internet a

904
00:54:40.231 --> 00:54:45.000
couple of days ago of all the people on the train with the newspapers,

905
00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:47.940
that was amazing,
wasn't it?
Beautiful,

906
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:52.440
beautiful caption was something like technology is making us antisocial and then

907
00:54:52.441 --> 00:54:56.680
it showed all these people from like the black and white 1930 train.
Yeah.

908
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:59.940
And everyone's got a paper in front of their face and now it's,

909
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:02.240
everyone's got a phone and the fucked,

910
00:55:02.241 --> 00:55:05.580
must it have been back then to get your news from some stupid piece of paper

911
00:55:05.581 --> 00:55:08.060
that William Randolph Hearst edited.
I mean,

912
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:10.290
that's how marijuana became illegal in the first place.

913
00:55:10.291 --> 00:55:13.560
She gets William Randolph Hearst got ahold of,
uh,
this,
uh,

914
00:55:13.561 --> 00:55:15.570
this idea to stop marijuana,

915
00:55:15.571 --> 00:55:20.300
stop hemp production from being made after that call.
The decorticator,
I mean,

916
00:55:20.301 --> 00:55:22.380
William Randolph Hearst who ran the fucking newspapers,

917
00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:26.520
at least people right here,
they're probably re reading 80% bullshit.

918
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:30.960
They do well in the New York Times today.

919
00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:34.560
I read it so hard to get information back then.

920
00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:39.660
I read if I beat a Bailey fucking awful cartoons.

921
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:44.300
You remember how dark knight or whatever unfunny which one?

922
00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:48.180
Like family circus,
the funny pages.
Oh yeah.
You would read them and go,

923
00:55:48.181 --> 00:55:50.310
this is dog shit.

924
00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:53.730
There's never been a worse version of the comedy.

925
00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:59.310
There's never been a worse like depiction of the comedy arts manifested in a,

926
00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:03.540
in a,
in a,
you know,
in a final product.
Then cartoons,

927
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:06.800
like a funny pages like Annie and Kathy.

928
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:11.550
Remember Kathy Doonesbury Dude,

929
00:56:11.551 --> 00:56:15.300

What was the like,
Oh,

Who's Binchy now?
You can't,

931
00:56:19.991 --> 00:56:22.170
you can't make it funny.
It's not funny.
You can't do it.

932
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.010
I mean every now and then the,

Marmaduke yeah.
Margaret,
get the fuck out of here with Marvin.

936
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:32.920
Somebody didn't just pay for Marmaduke.

937
00:56:32.921 --> 00:56:37.070
Somebody made millions off of Pharma Dharma.
Dukie who was the one?
Um,

938
00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:39.920
I love the far side though.

He did an episode of News Radio and the guy who was the creator of Dilbert,

945
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:08.270
cause there's the little fat guy right with the glasses.
He was like,

946
00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.620
let's do that heat.
This is what he looked.
He was like a little Humpty dumpty.

Why did you do poppers?
Because you've got to try shit.

953

That's a gay thing,

No,

959
00:58:03.821 --> 00:58:08.310
pretty much what it is is a VCR head cleaner and um,

960
00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:13.480
it's like if you go into any shop,

963
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:25.420
any sort of like novelty sex store or something like that,

964
00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:27.610
they will have at the very front case,

965
00:58:27.611 --> 00:58:31.300
they'll have these little vials and sometimes they'll be like,
oh,

966
00:58:31.301 --> 00:58:35.980
a VCR cleaner because we all know we all still own VCRs.
Um,

967
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.860
so it's bath salts.
No,
it's not Bessel.

968
00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:41.020
It's sort of a thing where does it make something illegal?

969
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:45.820
Because he'd say it's not for right?
Absolutely.
Yes,
yes,
yes.
It's like,
yeah,

970
00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:49.510
it's a,
it's a,
it's a cleaner or sometimes it'll have like a nickname too.

971
00:58:49.511 --> 00:58:52.330
It like jungle juice or,
you know,
something stupid.

972
00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:56.000
And what it is is like I've done it.
I,

973
00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:59.830
I did it like once or twice,
but it's one of those things where it's like you,

974
00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:03.610
you do it and it's like there's this crazy head rush in your body just gets like

975
00:59:03.611 --> 00:59:05.980
really,
really hot and it only lasts for like 10 seconds.

976
00:59:05.981 --> 00:59:09.280
I compare it to like whip.
It's if you've ever done whippets it's like that.
Okay.

977
00:59:09.281 --> 00:59:14.060
So is this actual amyl nitrate or is this just some other kind of head rush?
Um,

978
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:19.830
they say it loosens up your butt and I don't know about that cause I don't,

979
00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:24.560
I'm a top and
very specific rules.

980
00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:26.480
Do you start out of top or is it like,
you know,

981
00:59:26.481 --> 00:59:28.870
like you're an open miker you work your way up to being a middle act.

982
00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:34.160
How does it work?
I'm topping tonight.
Oh Man,
I got a tight 30,

983
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:42.260
tight 30.
Um,
no,
it's,
I don't know.

984
00:59:42.261 --> 00:59:46.510
I just don't like things up my bud.
But some dudes do some,

985
00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:50.210
some deals.
You got to find what I'm there for.
That's what it's all about.

986
00:59:50.211 --> 00:59:51.010
Life is all about

987
00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:55.480
<v 2>finding people who want what you need to give them.
Yeah.</v>

988
00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:58.990
Yeah.
I help people out.
My friend chuck,

989
00:59:59.050 --> 01:00:02.050
he had this girl that he was dating and uh,
she,

990
01:00:02.051 --> 01:00:04.870
all she wanted to do was suck his dick.
And I was like,
it's a dude.

991
01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:07.630
You'd probably have a dude that's like pretending to be a girl.
He's like,
no man,

992
01:00:07.631 --> 01:00:10.660
we,
I mean,
we had sex a couple of times.
He goes,
but her favorite thing was just,

993
01:00:10.661 --> 01:00:13.420
just suck my deck.
And I was like,
that's so weird.
He goes,
yeah.

994
01:00:13.421 --> 01:00:16.330
After a while it was kinda like,
I was like,
come on on of sacks.
And she's like,

995
01:00:16.331 --> 01:00:18.520
no,
no,
no.
I just want to suck your Dick.
And I was like,

996
01:00:18.521 --> 01:00:21.100
did your pussy is mine or something?
And he's like,
no.
She goes,

997
01:00:21.101 --> 01:00:24.820
she was just weird,
said she got more satisfaction out of sucking Dick.

998
01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.780
Then she did a out of actually having sex.
We're all crazy busy.

999
01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:34.580
<v 8>There's so many.
I mean,
I mean,
have you ever talked to Dan Savage?
Um,</v>

1000
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.900
Dan Savage?
Yeah.
No,
I know who he is though.
I mean,
he,
I love that guy to death.

1001
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:43.250
I would just like a sex advice guy.
Right.
He's just the coolest dude ever.
I mean,

1002
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.510
I would love to just like sit down with him and just brunch.

1003
01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.011
Just be like,

1004
01:00:49.011 --> 01:00:52.280
cause I think he's one of those guys who takes it to that next level.

1005
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:55.120
What's so I don't,
I'm not really,
I just know his name.

1006
01:00:55.121 --> 01:00:57.890
Like the whole like gay rights.
He's like a huge,
like he's the,

1007
01:00:57.891 --> 01:00:59.510
it gets better guy.
Like he,
you know,

1008
01:00:59.511 --> 01:01:04.511
he's like a big campaign for like the LGBT movement and like equality and um,

1009
01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:09.050
he's just one of those guys,
he's the guy who liked,
coined,
uh,
Santorum,

1010
01:01:09.051 --> 01:01:11.510
Rick Santorum when he was an asshole or whatever.
He,
he,

1011
01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:16.790
he compared Santorum to like a frothy anal leakage,
whatever.

1012
01:01:16.791 --> 01:01:17.511
And so every,

1013
01:01:17.511 --> 01:01:21.620
like he coined the phrase Santorum and named it after Rick Santorum.

1014
01:01:21.621 --> 01:01:25.670
Like that kind of stuff.
I was like,
I love that stuff.
Is that Santorum guy?

1015
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.480
A lot of people I went to after that car,
so many of them.
Did you see the whole,

1016
01:01:30.481 --> 01:01:32.300
like the Coca Cola thing?

1017
01:01:32.301 --> 01:01:36.490
Did you the the Superbowl commercial with that and what we were talking about,

1018
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.690
they did the Superbowl commercial where they played America,

1019
01:01:38.691 --> 01:01:42.320
the beautiful and they sang America the beautiful and did it in different

1020
01:01:42.321 --> 01:01:46.850
languages.
They did it in Spanish,
they did it in like Hindu.
They did it.
And like,

1021
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:47.690
you know,

1022
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:52.160
all these different languages because that's what America is and you get all

1023
01:01:52.161 --> 01:01:55.370
these crazy people who were just like,
this is my country.

1024
01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:59.660
I'm drinking Pepsi now,
Hashtag Fuck Coke.
You know?

1025
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:04.700
And it's,
it's,
it's,
it's embarrassing.
I mean,

1026
01:02:04.701 --> 01:02:06.380
I'm just like,
you have all these people you have,

1027
01:02:06.381 --> 01:02:09.440
and then there was like a gay couple in the commercial and everyone's like,
oh,

1028
01:02:09.441 --> 01:02:12.320
I'm not drinking that fag coke now.
It's like,
God,

1029
01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.350
<v 2>that's why I was going to say like,
it's interesting,</v>

1030
01:02:14.351 --> 01:02:18.370
like you through those together and you're right to do so.
It's like,

1031
01:02:18.371 --> 01:02:21.300
it's all intolerance.
It's all intolerance and ignorance.

1032
01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:25.710
The language and tolerance is just as bad as the homophobia is just as bad as

1033
01:02:25.711 --> 01:02:29.610
the racism is just as bad as that nationalism.
Absolutely.
It's just dumb asses.

1034
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.630
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
To throw them in together.
That's a,

1035
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:37.260
that's an important distinction because it really is the same.
It's just idiots.

1036
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:39.230
It's really the same.
What was the,

1037
01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:43.500
<v 8>there was something else too.
Pop country ain't allowed a spate no ass bang.</v>

1038
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:45.780
Yo just pissed me off that whole,

1039
01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:48.720
the whole Grammy's wedding to that whole thing.

1040
01:02:48.721 --> 01:02:52.410
I actually knew one of the guys and the WHO got married at the grammys,

1041
01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:55.140
I don't know what you're talking about.
They,
there was like,
um,

1042
01:02:55.650 --> 01:03:00.060
they did the Macklemore's same love song for the Grammy's and like Queen Latifa

1043
01:03:00.061 --> 01:03:04.830
came out on stage.
Like she actually just walked out.

1044
01:03:04.831 --> 01:03:06.560
She didn't like come out.
But um,

1045
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:11.660
she came out on stage and she is a minister and she married like 32 couples,

1046
01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:13.980
gay and straight.
It was just marriage,

1047
01:03:13.981 --> 01:03:17.910
just supporting equality and love and then,
you know,
it was actually really nice.

1048
01:03:17.911 --> 01:03:20.760
You just said like cuts to like,
who was it?
I'm trying to remember who it was.
Oh,

1049
01:03:20.761 --> 01:03:25.650
it was like Keith Urban,
just crying,
just bawling.
And I was like,
oh,
look at him,

1050
01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:32.460
look at that little guy.
And I'm immediately to Twitter.
They were like,
oh,

1051
01:03:32.461 --> 01:03:36.030
the Grammy's were great until the fans got married.
I'm like,
my God,

1052
01:03:36.031 --> 01:03:39.600
do you not like what's wrong with you?
Like who cares?

1053
01:03:39.601 --> 01:03:43.740
Is it bothering you that much that you have to take it to Twitter and hope that

1054
01:03:43.741 --> 01:03:47.040
someone,
and now the Twitter is doing it too.
And I think social media too,

1055
01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:51.330
they're taking like the most offensive tweets from people and like displaying

1056
01:03:51.331 --> 01:03:55.070
them,
like showing the ignorance.
It's like that lady who,
uh,

1057
01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:58.230
there's just like websites and stuff now that are not like buzzfeed and they're

1058
01:03:58.231 --> 01:04:00.780
just like,
look at,
these are the reactions from like,
right,

1059
01:04:00.781 --> 01:04:02.970
but it's horrible people.
Twitter's not,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1060
01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:05.040
It's like that one chick who was like the,

1061
01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:09.840
she was like a head of a company or something and she flew to Africa and she was

1062
01:04:09.841 --> 01:04:13.620
like,
she's from South Africa.
She's like,
well,
go on to going to Africa.

1063
01:04:13.621 --> 01:04:17.670
Hope I don't get aids.
J K I'm white.
And it's like,
why would you do that?

1064
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:20.450
She's probably on a Xanax and she had a glass of wine,

1065
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:23.200
lost a fucking Marvo South Africa flying to south APP.

1066
01:04:23.201 --> 01:04:26.730
She's flying to her hometown and she's in America with this like head of head of

1067
01:04:26.731 --> 01:04:30.690
something.
She was like some executive of some company and they were like,
well,

1068
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.660
you got fired there.
Sorry about it.
It's funny.

1069
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:38.580
If she was Ari Shaffir I'd been fine.
That's what the guard would have said.

1070
01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.960
No one.
Sure.
He's probably upset that I should have come up with dental.

1071
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:43.890
My old man went to Africa before her.

1072
01:04:43.891 --> 01:04:47.220
I would have definitely said something totally should have done that drove.
Yeah,

1073
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.570
I mean it's silly.

1074
01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:53.160
<v 2>It's silly for her to do it,
but it's also silly for people to get upset.</v>

1075
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:56.480
It's a joke.
She's choking.
She's probably fucked up.
You know,

1076
01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.040
maybe she's good at her job and they're going to fire her just because she said

1077
01:04:59.041 --> 01:05:03.960
that she on that,
cause he was funny.
She got a little Xanax in her system,

1078
01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:06.870
had a couple of cocktails and thought she was hilarious.

1079
01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:13.500
I can't wait till I landed in African,
see my tweets.
Oh mg.
Am I right ladies?

1080
01:05:13.501 --> 01:05:18.190
I think it's so fun of higher.
God.
No.
Do I eat?

1081
01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:23.010
How do I eat?
Eat Now?
Yeah.
I'm,

1082
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:28.020
I'm a disturbed that the amount of intolerance in this country still at the

1083
01:05:28.031 --> 01:05:31.510
level that it's at,
but I feel like we're at a turning point.
I really do.

1084
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:33.190
I feel like there's a tipping point.

1085
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:36.700
Like there's going to be like a lot of stupidity that comes along with the

1086
01:05:36.701 --> 01:05:41.170
tipping point,
like massive over sensitivity,
massive overreaction to things.

1087
01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:43.210
Especially like with,
people were joking around about things

1088
01:05:44.290 --> 01:05:46.920
<v 8>that's apologize.
It need to apologize.</v>

1089
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:51.790
<v 2>Yeah.
But ultimately I think like the climate is way different people way more</v>

1090
01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:55.710
sensitive to things now than they were just a few decades ago.

1091
01:05:55.810 --> 01:06:00.220
Definitely more than even really even more than just a few years ago.
You know,

1092
01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:03.550
it's,
it's changed,
changed quite a bit.

1093
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:08.200
And I think a lot of that is just the exposure to different people on the

1094
01:06:08.201 --> 01:06:10.560
Internet and when people,
um,

1095
01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:13.600
who don't get to interact with each other on a regular basis.

1096
01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.000
Like you don't get to interact with each other in real life.
Right.

1097
01:06:16.001 --> 01:06:17.290
But then you start to do it online.

1098
01:06:17.291 --> 01:06:19.060
Do you realize that this is just a bunch of fucking people,

1099
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.120
people are people hiding behind the Internet?
Yeah.

1100
01:06:22.121 --> 01:06:25.680
And the idea that you can generalize like just on sight,
sight unseen,

1101
01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:28.120
just looking at someone or just knowing their lifestyle.

1102
01:06:28.121 --> 01:06:29.890
Like you can generalize what kind of a person they are.

1103
01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:34.150
That's just unbelievably ridiculous because you can't do that with straight

1104
01:06:34.151 --> 01:06:36.100
people are all straight people.
Great.
Okay.

1105
01:06:36.101 --> 01:06:37.540
Well what about all the straight serial killers?

1106
01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.990
What about on the straight rapist?
What about a straight Thies?

1107
01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:43.030
What about now you can't take team straight cause teams traits filled with

1108
01:06:43.031 --> 01:06:47.560
Douche bags.
Okay,
so what,
what team are you on?
You're on team people fuck face.

1109
01:06:47.561 --> 01:06:52.210
Okay then I'm on,
I'm on team people includes gay,
straight,
black,
white

1110
01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:53.710
<v 8>and that's one of the things too.
I hang out,</v>

1111
01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:57.430
I hang out with mostly straight people.
Like that's,
that's the thing.

1112
01:06:57.431 --> 01:07:00.570
And I actually feel lucky because I'm like wow.
I,

1113
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.300
I remember when I first first started doing standup at like people were like,

1114
01:07:05.650 --> 01:07:09.880
I'm just going to do an ra voice type as well.
Cause it was him.
Oh,

1115
01:07:09.881 --> 01:07:12.130
so are you going to like,
we're going to like try and fuck me.
I'm like,

1116
01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:16.600
you're a six.
Like you're like that.
You're an la six,
you're like a,

1117
01:07:16.601 --> 01:07:19.030
you're like a North Dakota negative three.

1118
01:07:19.031 --> 01:07:23.110
Like I'm negative three and these worth less in North Dakota.
Yeah,
probably.

1119
01:07:23.111 --> 01:07:27.790
So it's more valuable in la.
It's more valuable than La.
Keep up here.
But uh,

1120
01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:31.120
why is that?
It's the juicing.
Nah,

1121
01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:34.540
I love Ari can be right.
But he was one of those guys.

1122
01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:37.600
It's not necessarily that it was like giving me a hard time,
but it was just,

1123
01:07:37.601 --> 01:07:41.830
I entered being funny,
but I entered into this boy's club,
you know,

1124
01:07:41.831 --> 01:07:46.030
and it was like,
it was one of those things were people were very weird.

1125
01:07:46.031 --> 01:07:47.710
Like they didn't know what to do with me.

1126
01:07:47.711 --> 01:07:51.940
And so I had to just like kind of just show them that I'm just me.
You know,

1127
01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:52.803
there will be

1128
01:07:52.810 --> 01:07:53.920
<v 2>ever worry.
Sorry to interrupt you.</v>

1129
01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:57.550
Do you ever worry when you're meeting people and they find out you're gay,

1130
01:07:57.810 --> 01:08:00.830
you're going to get a negative reaction?
I don't give a shit.
Right.
I think it's,

1131
01:08:00.830 --> 01:08:05.150
<v 8>it's the same thing.
It's like,
oh,
you're,
you like a MMA?
Oh,
okay,
well,
um,</v>

1132
01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:08.790
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna go,
you know,
it's like,
not that,

1133
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:11.910
not that that's the same thing,
but it's one of those things.
I'm like,

1134
01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:15.440
what I like is what I'm saying when I get off stage,
it's like,
I,
I get guys,

1135
01:08:15.441 --> 01:08:18.860
I'll get like the bro do too,
just like the old man was phony,
you know,
I'm like,

1136
01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:21.570

you know?
Ooh,
maybe.
And uh,

1137
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.950
um,
but it's one of those things where I'm like,
okay,
then I've done my job,

1138
01:08:27.951 --> 01:08:31.380
you know,
I get girls,
I get guys,
I got couples,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's,

1139
01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.750
it's cool and you know,
it's,
it's,
yeah.
I know part of that,

1140
01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:39.350
what you're saying is that like,
someone who has a problem with you being gay,

1141
01:08:39.351 --> 01:08:41.510
who gives a fuck and you want to talk to them in the first place.
Right.

1142
01:08:41.530 --> 01:08:44.060
They just think it's like,
oh,
you have a problem with,
you know,

1143
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:47.570
a black comic or you have a problem with the juke comic or a female comic or,

1144
01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:49.730
you know,
whatever.
It's like,
are you just have a problem,

1145
01:08:49.731 --> 01:08:52.760
you just need to go home and look at yourself in the mirror and take a nice hot

1146
01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.110
bath and listen to some shot.

1147
01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:58.580
Do you find a comics like are more accepting than regular people?
Like generally?

1148
01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.020
Yeah.
Yeah.
I I mm hmm.
I don't know.

1149
01:09:04.021 --> 01:09:07.530
There's a lot of ego involved.
Do you know what I mean?
So comedy,
comedy,

1150
01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:12.790
there's a lot of ego involved so it's,
it just depends,
you know,
hey,

1151
01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:15.250
he's getting laughs but it's cause he's all gay.
Yeah.

1152
01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:18.330
And then you have those comics who,
I mean,
I remember,
uh,

1153
01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:22.320
I've been brought up to like,
I don't stage before like,
okay,
you guys ready?

1154
01:09:22.321 --> 01:09:25.290
This next guy is a fag comic.
I'm like,
what the hell?

1155
01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.850
I've had that with some dude.
No.
Was it Tony?
No,

1156
01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:34.110
at squashing me trying to be funny.
Um,
I have no idea.
This was like,

1157
01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.140
this was a law.
This was,
this wasn't even at the store or the factory.

1158
01:09:37.141 --> 01:09:37.920
This was like,

1159
01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:41.010
are you sure you didn't have a popper and tell them that to say that.
I'm like,

1160
01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:42.030
Hey,
can you bring me up to this

1161
01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:49.050
hanging out with werewolves crumpled teeth running naked in the woods in Canada?

1162
01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:55.830
Oh God,
that was,
um,
yeah,
it's very more accepting and I think as a community,

1163
01:09:55.831 --> 01:09:59.280
I think it's way more accepting.
I grew up very religious and it was,

1164
01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:03.330
I really lucked out.
Really lucked out.
Really lucked out.

1165
01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:05.700
I lucked out growing up religious,
no,

1166
01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:10.650
I lucked out with a cool family and cool friends and like,
I never,

1167
01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:13.170
you know,
I never got bullied.
I mean,
I got called names and stuff,

1168
01:10:13.171 --> 01:10:16.650
but I never got into like a physical fight with anybody.
You always out?

1169
01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.480
No.
When did you come out?
The first time?
Uh,

1170
01:10:22.290 --> 01:10:25.830
um,
God,
it was,
I think,

1171
01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:27.953
<v 9>hm.</v>

1172
01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.650
<v 8>19.
I think it was 19 and then I went back in and then I went back in and then I</v>

1173
01:10:32.651 --> 01:10:35.020
went,
yeah.
And then I came out,
there was like four or five times.

1174
01:10:35.021 --> 01:10:38.620
There was a buy phase.
There was a,
what is that like when you're,

1175
01:10:38.621 --> 01:10:41.530
when you want to go back in.
So you come out and then you go back in.

1176
01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.530
Is it because you're embarrassed as well?
I got,

1177
01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:49.150
I got outed by somebody.
So get out of,
by someone that you had sex with?

1178
01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:53.650
Uh,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Actually.
Yeah.

1179
01:10:53.651 --> 01:10:58.360
And then got caught by somebody.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1180
01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:02.530
And so why is this so funny?
I just,

1181
01:11:02.531 --> 01:11:06.270
I've just never really told this story before.
You don't have no,

1182
01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:09.710
I mean it's fine.
It's,
it's whatever.
Shit.
Okay.

1183
01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:12.040
I just don't want to be the pressure gun.
No,
no,
no.

1184
01:11:12.041 --> 01:11:15.300
But it's just funny now thinking about it.
I was like,
God,
I was such an asshole.

1185
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.730
Like I'm still dating this girl.
We never broke up.

1186
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:21.780
She could be married with kids now when we were still technically dating.

1187
01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:23.700
How can you be technically dating?
You know,

1188
01:11:23.701 --> 01:11:28.500
I was with this girl and then we like,
um,
you know,
I had the,
you know,

1189
01:11:28.501 --> 01:11:32.400
I had one of those weeks where I was like,
what are these feelings?
And you know,

1190
01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:33.293
um,

1191
01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:37.450
hooked up with this guy who I was friends with and like my roommate walked in,

1192
01:11:37.451 --> 01:11:40.410
it was like boop.
And I'm like,
I bet he have any avenue.

1193
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.300
And then I had no idea you were gay.
Well,
I mean everyone did.
And then like,

1194
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:48.090
so it got around,
it spread like wildfire.
I mean,
it got to,

1195
01:11:48.091 --> 01:11:50.310
when you say like the roommate walked in,

1196
01:11:50.311 --> 01:11:53.580
like what exactly what you're engaged in when the roommate opened the door,

1197
01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:58.080
I was under the covers.
Oh yeah.
So you one of the controversy,

1198
01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:00.920
the roommate and the roommate told me the dude was cross eyed.

1199
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.353
<v 3>Ooh.</v>

1200
01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.120
And he's holding onto the covers and near underneath it.

1201
01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.280
It was a lot of wiggling.
No,
you have an imagination,
Joe.
His toes are poking out.

1202
01:12:13.281 --> 01:12:17.760
The end us at the end of the then,
Ooh,

1203
01:12:18.170 --> 01:12:21.180
white knuckled.
Oh,

1204
01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:27.210
<v 8>that's right.
They call me the destroyer.
Yeah.
And then,
uh,</v>

1205
01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:30.260
it's spread.
I mean,
it went to Europe like this.

1206
01:12:30.261 --> 01:12:32.110
This is a rumor that rumor went to Europe,

1207
01:12:32.111 --> 01:12:36.220
there was like a school abroad program and someone sent a postcard was like,

1208
01:12:37.150 --> 01:12:40.390
it's what?
It's what they're singing about Justin.
True.
It was like Jesus,

1209
01:12:40.391 --> 01:12:43.080
it was like a stone henge like postcard.
I'm like,
enjoy stone.

1210
01:12:43.081 --> 01:12:47.410
Henge don't worry about me.
Yeah.
Uh,
care.
And,
uh,

1211
01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:51.460
I mean this was back,
this was like the early 2000,
so it was like,
um,

1212
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:55.510
it was a different time,
but at the same time it was,
it was,
I didn't,

1213
01:12:55.511 --> 01:12:57.890
I didn't have to worry about like,
you know,

1214
01:12:57.970 --> 01:13:02.920
I feel bad for kids today with like the cyberbullying and the,
the,

1215
01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:07.640
I mean even youtube comments,
like I have stuff on online like from,

1216
01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:10.180
you know,
from the laugh factor or whatever and it'll be like,

1217
01:13:10.181 --> 01:13:14.010
you'll have that one that's just like,
fag kill yourself.
I'm like,
cut Jesus.

1218
01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:19.390
What the fuck man?
I'm like,
no,
you kill your self.
Yeah,
buddy.

1219
01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:23.830
I'll show you.
Look.
Yeah,
look,

1220
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:27.910
when you're 19 years old,
it's,
it's hard to figure out who the fuck you,

1221
01:13:27.911 --> 01:13:31.780
even though I tried to take on a bunch of different roles when I was 19 years

1222
01:13:31.781 --> 01:13:35.300
old,
I tried to pretend I was different things.
I tried to,
like,

1223
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:37.630
I remember like I decided I was going to be a carpenter.

1224
01:13:37.690 --> 01:13:40.990
I fucking hated carpentry tree.
I did it for like a week and I was like,

1225
01:13:40.991 --> 01:13:42.910
what am I doing?
That's not what I want to do.

1226
01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:44.920
I'm pretending this is what I want to do for a living.

1227
01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:47.710
I don't want to do this for a living.
I need to figure out,
you know,

1228
01:13:47.711 --> 01:13:52.711
but I couldn't imagine what it would be like to like want to be something that

1229
01:13:52.781 --> 01:13:56.530
you're not or not want people to know who you are.

1230
01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:59.470
It was one of those days and I didn't have like a,

1231
01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:03.820
my family would never really like talked about sex and,

1232
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:08.770
and I grew up in Texas and it was one of those,
uh,
San Antonio.
And,

1233
01:14:08.771 --> 01:14:12.130
um,
I just remember just me,
it was very religious.

1234
01:14:12.131 --> 01:14:15.310
Like we didn't talk about masturbation.
It was always like,
you know,

1235
01:14:15.311 --> 01:14:19.210
it was just like sex ed was all about like put a condom on and like everyone

1236
01:14:19.211 --> 01:14:21.100
giggled and like,
you know,
it was,
uh,

1237
01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:24.910
I think my sex talk even was like my mom just being like,

1238
01:14:24.911 --> 01:14:28.420
now a guy puts his penis in a vagina and it feels real good.
All right.

1239
01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:31.450
Has got to go,
you know?
And I was just like,
what the hell?

1240
01:14:31.451 --> 01:14:35.650
Did she just say cigarettes?
No,
she didn't smoke.
She smoked pot,

1241
01:14:35.651 --> 01:14:39.010
but she didn't spell it right.
Mom smoke pile.
Yeah.
Really?
She's a cool mom.

1242
01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:40.960
A ways.
Even when you were young.
Oh,

1243
01:14:40.961 --> 01:14:44.230
I'm sure there's stories that I hear about my mom recently and they're like,

1244
01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:47.410
Shit.
Like she,
uh,
she's five.
Two,
I'm like six,

1245
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:50.170
three and so like I'm fucking giant.

1246
01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:54.610
Giant fetus just growing in that water bed and it must have banged her.

1247
01:14:54.611 --> 01:14:59.350
How big is your dad?
Yeah.
Six.
Three?
Yeah.
Six.
Three,
six,
four.
Yeah.

1248
01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:01.000
They fucking corn,

1249
01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:06.001
Italian corn fed Stromae and making him a Martindale.

1250
01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:11.380
Aw Man.
I just swam.
Just move bitches.

1251
01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:14.290
You got brothers and sisters?
I got two brothers and a sister.
Yeah.

1252
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:17.200
How many of them are good?
None.
Zero.
None.

1253
01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:22.750
How many of them are borderline?
Uh,
how many of them could be persuaded?

1254
01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:26.320
I don't think they could be persuaded.
I mean,
I mean what they were,

1255
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:29.290
one of them was in the military,
so I don't know what the shit that he saw,

1256
01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:34.960
but uh,
I wouldn't think so.
There's a lot of gay sex in the military.
You know,

1257
01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.320
I think I'm not going to answer that with a yes or no.

1258
01:15:38.321 --> 01:15:42.070
I just think that a lot of people will do things when they're away.
Okay.

1259
01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:44.920
Right now people in Afghanistan or fucking taken off their headphones,

1260
01:15:44.921 --> 01:15:45.760
throwing them on the ground.

1261
01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:50.910
My brother was fucking hippie pod cab brother was sucking cock.

1262
01:15:51.230 --> 01:15:53.770
I don't care what the Fuck Justin Martin Dale says,

1263
01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.670
I'm over here fighting for freedom.
I know what my brother was in Kuwait.

1264
01:15:57.671 --> 01:16:00.610
My brother drove a tank.
Everybody say I respect the military.
No.

1265
01:16:00.611 --> 01:16:02.170
Hey Dick sick suck.
Suck.

1266
01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:06.730
I mean I think he told me that he almost got shot by a woman like,

1267
01:16:06.970 --> 01:16:10.930
like crazy stuff cause I mean it's one of those we didn't talk woman soldier or

1268
01:16:10.931 --> 01:16:12.570
like a woman.
Like I um,

1269
01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.760
she was dressed in civilian clothes and she like pulled out a gun and,

1270
01:16:15.850 --> 01:16:20.740
and his friend saw it and shot her in the head and saved his life.

1271
01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:25.090
Oh snap.
So I'm very grateful for that friend.
Cause that,

1272
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:28.690
yeah,
I couldn't imagine that.
That's messed up.

1273
01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:32.530
So I applaud you guys over there for doing that.
Cause I cannot do that.

1274
01:16:32.650 --> 01:16:37.600
Especially with this hair.
Your hair's too good for Iraq.
Shit.
I could,

1275
01:16:37.630 --> 01:16:39.190
I would cry like a little bitch.

1276
01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:42.290
You would cry like a little bitch if you had to deal with some way,
shape yet.

1277
01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.720
War and shaving.
My God.
Yeah,
I would.
I'd go crazy.
I'd probably,

1278
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:50.650
I'd probably kill myself.
I couldn't,
I say that,
but I couldn't.
I just,

1279
01:16:50.730 --> 01:16:54.760
I couldn't do that like that David Koresh video was enough for me because I just

1280
01:16:54.761 --> 01:16:59.260
kept hearing the babies and the women crying in the background and I was like,
I,

1281
01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:03.250
I talked to a dude at told me there's some gay shit going on on a navy boat.

1282
01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:08.560
He said there was a lot of gay shit going on.
Boats,
seaman.
Don't ask,
don't tell.

1283
01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:09.980
They had a,
a boat

1284
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:14.600
<v 0>filled with men.
It's all me.
I think.
I just think guys were just sexual beings,</v>

1285
01:17:14.601 --> 01:17:16.810
you know,
it's,
you know,
they're gonna,
you know,

1286
01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:21.880
we're not going to talk about this,
you know?
Yeah.
Come on son.

1287
01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:25.850
You keep a secret first of all,
before you answer yes or no,

1288
01:17:25.851 --> 01:17:27.200
I want you to a little bit.
These lips,

1289
01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:32.930
her lips to have their own business and they understand how it works.
Okay,

1290
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:35.600
now close your eyes.
Close Your eyes and touch my lips.

1291
01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:40.910
I'm going to fucking shave.
I'm gonna fucking Shit.
I'm just the future son mean.

1292
01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:43.510
Fill them up.
So think about if you don't let them get them all wet first of all,

1293
01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:48.800
now feel it.
Feel it.
Just kidding.
Justin hard.

1294
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:54.390
Pretend that some wall men close your eyes.
Do you jerk off?
Yeah.

1295
01:17:54.391 --> 01:17:57.410
What a man hand you jerk off and I was like,

1296
01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.380
I was like so many guys are like turned on right now.
Just wrapping this lips.

1297
01:18:00.381 --> 01:18:03.080
Yeah,
at least three or four.
This is a lot of people listening.

1298
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:06.710
There's people that get turned on from anything.
You've got nice science,
Joe.

1299
01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:09.800
Thank you very much.
I like them.
They helped me see

1300
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:14.970
the kind eyes.
I'll get you some roses for Valentine's Day,
dude.

1301
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:17.420
One 800 flowers.com click on the microphone.

1302
01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:21.990
Don't be scared and use the code word,
J r e n save yourself some cash.
Bounced.

1303
01:18:21.991 --> 01:18:23.180
Check.
I bow bow.

1304
01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:28.260
<v 8>You're on the cover of a Huffington post right now.
Am I?</v>

1305
01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:33.160
Or Huffington didn't gay what isn't you?
And that's that funny or die spoof.
Yeah,

1306
01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:37.800
yeah,
yeah.
Me and my buddies did a spoof on the show looking on Hbo.

1307
01:18:37.801 --> 01:18:40.690
What's it at?
How many hits is it have,
does it say?
No.

1308
01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.240
My friend drew druggie and Jason Loony,
uh,
myself,

1309
01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:49.700
my friend Jeremy did a spoof cause it's,
it's,

1310
01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:53.040
if you haven't seen that show looking,
it's on HBO and it's getting a lot of um,

1311
01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:54.930
heat because everyone's like,
oh,

1312
01:18:54.931 --> 01:18:58.140
this is stupid and this isn't a how gay people are represented in San Francisco.

1313
01:18:58.141 --> 01:19:00.030
It's actually decent show.
I went up,

1314
01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:04.570
<v 0>what's the best representative of gay folks?
Remember a queer as folk.</v>

1315
01:19:04.730 --> 01:19:07.540
Is that good?
Um,
yeah.

1316
01:19:07.541 --> 01:19:11.980
I mean that was more I think extreme cause it show,
I mean it was very,

1317
01:19:12.670 --> 01:19:17.350
it was very,
very,
very,
very sexual and yeah,
dancing and,
and drugs and,

1318
01:19:17.351 --> 01:19:18.910
but it was,
the characters were great.

1319
01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:23.200
How sparks was one of the guys on the parks a straight,
which is fascinating.

1320
01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:28.150
Don't do that.
What don't you make that fucking incredulous?
No,

1321
01:19:28.170 --> 01:19:32.260
that's just my face.
I know.
What the fuck you now I know what the fuck you did.

1322
01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:37.090
Listen,
he is though.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1323
01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:40.120
Look at me anyway.
Okay.
We're good here.

1324
01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.730
I think we have enough information

1325
01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:48.220
about human language.
The human language has a lot of subtlety to it,

1326
01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:53.200
so one of the things that I find so offensive about people pretending that jokes

1327
01:19:53.201 --> 01:19:56.170
are statements is because just there.
What we did,

1328
01:19:56.171 --> 01:19:59.680
we transferred information very clearly between each other and most people

1329
01:19:59.681 --> 01:20:04.240
listening know exactly what the fuck do you said?
And they know that I know that.

1330
01:20:04.241 --> 01:20:08.180
You know what you know?
Yeah.
Boom,

1331
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:12.930
<v 2>boom.
I think he's,
he's a great guy.
He's a great guy.
He's very funny.</v>

1332
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:16.830
Good looking.
Very handsome.
He's into a lot of conspiracies.

1333
01:20:17.370 --> 01:20:21.300
How's parks?
Didn't you like it wasn't like a nine 11 guy,
was he got it.
Yeah.

1334
01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:25.440
I think he might.
I should be careful because I've been accused of that unjustly.

1335
01:20:25.441 --> 01:20:30.441
So what being a nine 11 guy conspiracy theorist for nine 11 but you buy guy that

1336
01:20:30.691 --> 01:20:35.691
I had on the podcast and I fucking told him to his face that I don't think it's

1337
01:20:35.941 --> 01:20:37.160
a conspiracy and he's still writing.

1338
01:20:37.161 --> 01:20:40.350
And I think it's a conspiracy because people are fucking with that.

1339
01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:42.720
Is that like they illuminati of conspiracy theorists?

1340
01:20:43.290 --> 01:20:48.290
It's just a convenient one because it was a conspiracy to commit the crimes that

1341
01:20:49.831 --> 01:20:53.250
were committed.
It was a conspiracy to fly planes into buildings for sure.

1342
01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:56.870
Someone conspired,
they took over airliners,
they,

1343
01:20:56.910 --> 01:21:00.000
they hijack them and they flew them into buildings.
That alone,

1344
01:21:00.001 --> 01:21:04.140
no matter who did it,
whether it was the government or whether it was like some,

1345
01:21:04.570 --> 01:21:08.460
whether it was Saudi Arabia,
whether it was the al Qaeda and the Taliban,

1346
01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:11.580
whoever did it,
it was a conspiracy.
100%.
Okay.

1347
01:21:11.581 --> 01:21:14.910
So let's just get that out of the way.
Nine 11 was a conspiracy,

1348
01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:18.060
but the people like the guy who ran out in the Super Bowl,
uh,

1349
01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:21.810
post super bowl interview and said not 11 was perpetrated by the government.

1350
01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:26.010
Those people are fucking wacky.
Oh yes.
All of that.
And yeah,
that's,

1351
01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:29.820
that's unnecessary.
Well,
the nine 11 truther is those people that run out.

1352
01:21:29.850 --> 01:21:33.180
You know,
the real issue with that is they don't know.

1353
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:37.740
You don't know and you're saying that you don't know.
I don't think it was,

1354
01:21:37.741 --> 01:21:42.540
I think it's much more likely that what happened was the United States was

1355
01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:47.541
attacked by a bunch of fucking psychos and the government took advantage of this

1356
01:21:48.481 --> 01:21:51.600
attack in order to instigate or to initiate rappers,

1357
01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:55.830
some plans that they had already,
they already wanted to go into Iraq.

1358
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:57.720
They'd wanted to go into Iraq for a long time.

1359
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:59.940
There was a bunch of shit that they wanted to do.

1360
01:21:59.941 --> 01:22:02.460
They wanted to go in Afghanistan.
He couldn't figure out a way to justify it.

1361
01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:05.450
Now they had a locks lock,

1362
01:22:05.451 --> 01:22:07.750
tight justified reason for,

1363
01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:11.160
for going to these places that that's what I think happened.

1364
01:22:11.161 --> 01:22:13.230
Much more likely then the,

1365
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:17.340
the thousands of people kept their mouth shut about organizing this horrible

1366
01:22:17.341 --> 01:22:21.990
crime that killed thousands of people and you know,
they,
they made the fucking,

1367
01:22:21.991 --> 01:22:26.490
the towers disappear.
I might fucking pot doctor man gave me a book.

1368
01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:29.340
I'm going to bring it in because it's so ridiculous.

1369
01:22:29.341 --> 01:22:33.240
He gives me this book about how nine 11 the towers were destroyed using Tesla

1370
01:22:33.241 --> 01:22:35.790
technology.
Oh,
right.
Tell him I go,
what?

1371
01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:39.210
Tesla magma like lava or something like,
no,
no,
no.

1372
01:22:39.211 --> 01:22:42.990
Well there's thermite is the big one that thermite cuts.

1373
01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.780
You know they've tested positive for thermo,

1374
01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:49.020
but the problem is like when the aluminum melts at all the different particles

1375
01:22:49.021 --> 01:22:53.220
are inside these infernos like you're going to get thermite like compounds

1376
01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:55.260
anyway.
It's just burning so hot.
Well,

1377
01:22:55.261 --> 01:22:58.290
all that stuff that's in there and there's like all these pictures that they

1378
01:22:58.291 --> 01:23:01.530
point to,
these girders cut exploding.

1379
01:23:01.531 --> 01:23:06.460
You can see the line cut in the grid of what they noticed was all cut by welders

1380
01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:11.410
<v 8>to to clean up the scrap like they have before and after pictures of those cuts.</v>

1381
01:23:11.411 --> 01:23:12.760
Like there's a lot of misses

1382
01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:17.210
<v 2>information and misunderstanding when it comes to a lot of conspiracy theories.</v>

1383
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:19.940
A lot of them,
a big percentage of them,

1384
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:24.190
<v 8>they're saying the Superbowl was rigged to [inaudible] must have been.</v>

1385
01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:28.010
They're saying the Superbowl was rigged and the United States wants Seattle to

1386
01:23:28.011 --> 01:23:30.440
when the red hot chili peppers were bunked.

1387
01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:34.610
That's what they say too though.
That's a new one,
right?
Yeah.

1388
01:23:34.611 --> 01:23:37.370
That that was just today breaking news.

1389
01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:42.080
They weren't playing their instruments and red hot chili peppers fake the funk.

1390
01:23:42.170 --> 01:23:43.700
I'm sure there's a picture.
Yeah,

1391
01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:46.070
they said that the red hot chili peppers guitars,

1392
01:23:46.071 --> 01:23:48.800
we're not plugged in during the Superbowl performance set hurts.

1393
01:23:48.801 --> 01:23:51.950
My soul hurts my heart a little bit.
It really does hurt.
I just want to go.

1394
01:23:52.190 --> 01:23:53.210
How does that happen?

1395
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:56.420
How does the red hot chili peppers ever get to a point where they're faking

1396
01:23:56.421 --> 01:23:57.380
print playing music?

1397
01:23:57.770 --> 01:24:01.090
I think what it is is that they actually can't hear when they're on that.

1398
01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:05.800
Around that many people would be impossible for them to actually,
yeah,

1399
01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:07.460
but they put it on your monitor is him.
Yeah,

1400
01:24:07.461 --> 01:24:10.920
but I think it's even La that loud that even that wouldn't even do anything.

1401
01:24:11.730 --> 01:24:15.930
Lotions and fireworks and is there a picture of this then?
It can't be any louder

1402
01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:19.600
<v 2>other than the UFC.
Like when the UFC is going on,
I have headphones on it.</v>

1403
01:24:19.601 --> 01:24:22.450
I don't,
I don't hear anything.
I can hear myself loud and clear.

1404
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:26.240
They the one that people are screaming at the top of their lungs when a fights

1405
01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:30.280
going on and their feet away from me in an indoor arena.
That thing,

1406
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:31.960
I mean the Superbowl might be more people,

1407
01:24:31.961 --> 01:24:34.720
but I couldn't imagine it would be louder,
especially without a roof.

1408
01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.370
I can't imagine how it could be louder.

1409
01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:38.300
<v 8>I want to go to a UFC fight with you.</v>

1410
01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:41.380
I think I haven't put that on my bucket list.
Yeah,
let me know,
man.

1411
01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:43.630
You never know what you never want to go to.
I watched that.

1412
01:24:43.631 --> 01:24:44.550
It's one February 2nd.

1413
01:24:44.551 --> 01:24:46.850
You want to watch some chicks beat the fuck out of each other?
I mean what?

1414
01:24:47.210 --> 01:24:52.010
Ronda Rousey and said,
wait a second.
It's okay.
22nd yeah,

1415
01:24:52.011 --> 01:24:54.620
let's go see some girls fight.
Well,
I will have to work,

1416
01:24:54.621 --> 01:24:58.190
but you may be able to sit and sit and watch a live tweet.

1417
01:24:58.191 --> 01:25:01.640
It can't sit with you and answer questions.
I have to,
I have to actually,

1418
01:25:01.641 --> 01:25:06.140
I saw that video of that guy's leg break and that,
oh God,
that was terrible.

1419
01:25:06.230 --> 01:25:08.780
It's rare to,
oh,
it was so gross.

1420
01:25:08.850 --> 01:25:11.400
<v 2>Yeah.
Really unusual to have a break like that.</v>

1421
01:25:11.401 --> 01:25:14.310
We've only had two breaks like that in the history of the UFC,

1422
01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:17.820
but there have been some and other organizations

1423
01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.410
<v 8>very similar where you got in a fight.
Oh yeah.
Of course.</v>

1424
01:25:20.411 --> 01:25:21.340
You were there when it happened.

1425
01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:27.920
<v 2>Almost all the paper views.
Almost all of them and all of the Fox shows.</v>

1426
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:31.910
I haven't been on all the Fox sports ones.
I don't do those anymore.

1427
01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:34.310
But I do virtually every paper view.

1428
01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:37.930
Unless there's some something serious going on that I can't do it.
But,
uh,

1429
01:25:38.150 --> 01:25:41.150
that's the only the second time it's ever happened and they haven't happened to

1430
01:25:41.151 --> 01:25:44.240
a great champion.
Like arguably the greatest fighter.
I've said,

1431
01:25:44.241 --> 01:25:46.670
the greatest fighter that's ever lived to have it happen to him.

1432
01:25:46.671 --> 01:25:50.390
That's pretty crazy.
That's sucks.
It's a nice sport,
man.
You know,

1433
01:25:50.391 --> 01:25:55.190
the human body's just not designed for it.
It's all about compromising joints.

1434
01:25:55.430 --> 01:26:00.430
It's all about cutting off blood and sparking your fucking nerves with

1435
01:26:00.801 --> 01:26:03.800
concussions and stopping your brain functioning.

1436
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:08.810
<v 0>It's really a really crazy sport.
That's pretty intense.
Yeah.
But the,</v>

1437
01:26:08.811 --> 01:26:12.380
the excitement that you get from that,
from a being so crazy,

1438
01:26:12.381 --> 01:26:13.940
it's like there's nothing like it in the world.

1439
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:16.780
And the girls go that hardcore to fuck.
Yeah.

1440
01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.340
Neesha tape versus Ronda Rousey,

1441
01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:23.810
which was the last big women's title fight that we had was one of the best

1442
01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:28.470
fights ever.
It was great.
It was so much drama in it.
Nisha all,

1443
01:26:28.471 --> 01:26:30.670
my God ma almost got fully onboard once,

1444
01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:34.630
but because Rhonda beat her by arm bar in the first fight and uh,

1445
01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:36.320
she'd beat her by our,
by the second fight too.

1446
01:26:36.321 --> 01:26:39.590
But Meesha got out of this crazy locked arm by,

1447
01:26:39.591 --> 01:26:42.490
you knew it was over and she gets out of it and the crowd's going insane.

1448
01:26:42.710 --> 01:26:44.420
And it was just like,
first of all,
we're,

1449
01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:47.510
Rhonda made her sail through the air with judo.
I mean,

1450
01:26:47.511 --> 01:26:50.390
that was one of the beautiful things about the fight was not just a two chicks

1451
01:26:50.391 --> 01:26:54.200
were going at it and said,
Ron does technique is impeccable.

1452
01:26:54.201 --> 01:26:58.130
It's like it hurts her judo is just magnificent.

1453
01:26:58.131 --> 01:27:00.770
Like her technique when she throws people,

1454
01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.140
it's a fucking work of art because like me,

1455
01:27:03.141 --> 01:27:07.340
she had tried to grapple with her and Rhonda launched her through the air.

1456
01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:09.680
Not once but several times,

1457
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:13.520
slammed her on her back and beautiful judo.

1458
01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:16.700
I mean world class,
judo in action.

1459
01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:20.540
Probably the best judo we've ever seen in the UFC,
you know,

1460
01:27:20.541 --> 01:27:22.910
in comparison like it relative to the,

1461
01:27:22.911 --> 01:27:26.690
to her weight class and her division and then her arm bar techniques.

1462
01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:31.010
The best in all of MMA.
That bitch is bad ass man.
She asked,

1463
01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.570
she's wicked.
She's like Chunley from street fighter.
Better,

1464
01:27:35.690 --> 01:27:38.150
better than a real person and she has a vagina.

1465
01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:43.700
I mean,
I've heard,
well you're talking about in the street front of the girl.

1466
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:48.230
I didn't know his girl,
Charlie.
I Dunno.
She's the one.
That's cool.
Yeah.

1467
01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:52.340
Rhonda Rousey.
Tie that bitch up and not throw off a building.
Damn.
Well wait,

1468
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.250
here's,
do they let them have long hair?
They have their hair.
I mean,

1469
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:58.040
I mean I get to get the guys to watch and take.
Can't grab it though.

1470
01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:00.860
You can't grab hair.
No,
cause I would say that would be like the first thing.

1471
01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:02.770
You always see that like in a girlfriend or they just,

1472
01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:06.770
well you used to be able to do that.
Like a,
when hoists Gracie fought,
uh,
chemo.

1473
01:28:06.771 --> 01:28:09.470
That's one of the ways it fuck chemo up.
He uh,

1474
01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:12.650
he had chemo in his guard and it was just bashing him,

1475
01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:16.040
holding onto his fucking ponytail.
He got ahold of that ponytail,

1476
01:28:16.110 --> 01:28:17.150
just fucked him up.

1477
01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:22.310
That was one of the all time craziest fights ever in the UFC.

1478
01:28:22.311 --> 01:28:24.680
Cause Chemo was enormous.

1479
01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:29.740
She never had a ponytail to 30 to 40 solid muscle and hoist was like one 70.

1480
01:28:30.801 --> 01:28:35.120
She's David and Goliath Pajamas.
Hoists still beat him still.

1481
01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:38.840
Armbar disaster oyster is a bad motherfucker back then and still is.

1482
01:28:38.841 --> 01:28:41.960
But back then,
that was the guy that changed at all.

1483
01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.990
He came around and showed people what's up.
Wow.

1484
01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:47.750
But back then you could grab hair.
Girls are not allowed to grab here.

1485
01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.360
They can't cut punt either.
Cut Punt.
He can't,

1486
01:28:51.490 --> 01:28:56.150
I'm sorry you can't kick a door in the Dick.
Oh girl can't come on.

1487
01:28:56.740 --> 01:29:00.220
That's,
I'll call it that.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a comedy podcast.

1488
01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:04.540
This is not what it's really called.
I learned a new word today.

1489
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:08.430
The Joe Rogan podcast.
You,
uh,
you're not allowed to kick a woman in the groin,

1490
01:29:08.431 --> 01:29:11.730
but they don't have protection on like a man does.
Oh,
they don't work cups.

1491
01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.470
I don't think that we're anything pretty sure their job.
But your,

1492
01:29:14.490 --> 01:29:16.530
your Coke Torres,
I'm sure it's very sensitive.

1493
01:29:16.810 --> 01:29:21.150
If you take a hard knee either there'll be horrible oh,
Chihuahua.

1494
01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:24.480
But uh,
that's illegal.
It's illegal just like it is on men.

1495
01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:26.350
But what is interesting is,
um,

1496
01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.300
I don't believe that the breasts are off target just grabbed,

1497
01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.390
a lot of women will wear like a,
you know,

1498
01:29:33.391 --> 01:29:36.300
they were like sport broadly sport bras and,

1499
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:39.450
but there's no real protection of the breasts.
I haven't yet.

1500
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:41.910
That's a really good question.
Actually.

1501
01:29:42.150 --> 01:29:47.150
I need to know if women's breasts are a target and MMA is or over the rules.

1502
01:29:47.461 --> 01:29:48.420
Exactly the same.

1503
01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:53.310
Maybe I would think they'd have to like tape their nipples.
No,
no,

1504
01:29:53.311 --> 01:29:56.310
no taping of the nipples.
Okay.
Here's the question.

1505
01:29:56.510 --> 01:30:00.360
Is the January 17th the very recent question,
Ken,

1506
01:30:00.990 --> 01:30:03.270
should chest trikes be band?

1507
01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:07.650
So they're talking about banning them for more for women.
It makes sense.

1508
01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:11.790
Well they're saying that it depends if the girl has implants.

1509
01:30:11.791 --> 01:30:14.100
If you ever hit a girl in the Boob,
like accidentally they'll,

1510
01:30:14.130 --> 01:30:17.840
they'll murder you mean accidentally?
Well like,
like all that,

1511
01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:20.910
just slap him around and say he slapped me around and hit him in the face.

1512
01:30:20.911 --> 01:30:21.840
You've got to tit slap him.

1513
01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:26.700
But I mean like I've been like out and like have nudged.
Yeah,

1514
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.980
they're just like sensitive.
That's why it feels good when you suck him striking.

1515
01:30:31.981 --> 01:30:35.100
The enhanced breast will most likely caused them to burst.

1516
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:39.540
So they keep a list of natural and surgically enhanced pressed for their female

1517
01:30:39.541 --> 01:30:44.330
fighters.
So That's interesting.
So if a woman has a surgically enhanced breasts,

1518
01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:49.770
they,
I guess they have to make a a deal where the girl,

1519
01:30:49.771 --> 01:30:53.400
if she's going to fight,
you can't,
uh,
you can't punch your tense.

1520
01:30:53.730 --> 01:30:56.070
Well that makes sense.
You don't want to busted boob.

1521
01:30:56.370 --> 01:30:58.650
This might be bullshit though.
This is on a forum by the way,

1522
01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:02.760
but it's on the underground and mixed martial arts.com and those guys are

1523
01:31:02.761 --> 01:31:07.680
usually a guy named a gumball kid has the,
uh,
thing I get,
let's,
let's find out.

1524
01:31:07.681 --> 01:31:08.790
They have,
do they have a list?

1525
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:13.200
He hit her in the boob and she just flies around the ring just like an old

1526
01:31:13.230 --> 01:31:17.040
balloons.
There she goes.
She's out.

1527
01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:23.630
Okay.
Do they have a list of enhanced breath for women's MMA?
Um,

1528
01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:30.300
no.
This,
I'll need to ask somebody.
This is,

1529
01:31:30.301 --> 01:31:34.670
this is too long of a Google search.
I need to call up a big John McCarthy or um,

1530
01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:38.990
yeah,
you can't,
can't kick the ball,
but you can grab it.
It's just weird.

1531
01:31:38.991 --> 01:31:43.370
Like you can grab that,
but guys do what they call an oil check.
Excuse.

1532
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:46.280
Oil check is sometimes in the middle of the grappling.

1533
01:31:46.490 --> 01:31:51.490
The guy will literally have his fingers deep into guys asshole just digging in

1534
01:31:52.251 --> 01:31:53.180
there and you know,

1535
01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:57.620
it forces the guy to move forces to got to move in away to get away from that

1536
01:31:57.621 --> 01:31:59.980
grip.
And I don't see,
I don't think it's in,
I don't

1537
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.740
<v 8>think it's illegal.
It's not,
I don't think it's illegal in wrestling either.</v>

1538
01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:05.890
I wouldn't start making MMA butt plugs.
No,

1539
01:32:05.891 --> 01:32:09.000
that would just shove something deeper in your ass and you have to have like a

1540
01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:11.650
protection.
But what if you don't love a flat?

1541
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:13.840
But the problem is you need movement,

1542
01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:16.090
like need your ass needs to be able to move.

1543
01:32:16.091 --> 01:32:19.670
So anything that you do that would like protect your ass hole,

1544
01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:21.700
we restrictive.
It'd be like,

1545
01:32:21.701 --> 01:32:24.070
it would restrict your ability to move left and right.

1546
01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:25.720
It would be a messenger boy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1547
01:32:25.721 --> 01:32:29.620
It would mess with your athleticism to our oil checks.
Legal.

1548
01:32:30.190 --> 01:32:34.390
What if it's like,
like this though,
like if it's as a flat

1549
01:32:36.650 --> 01:32:40.720
no sticking things in your ass.
So I need to find out if this is,
oh,

1550
01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:43.330
so what about the swan?
Ah,
I've got to go to the bathroom.
Like here's that.

1551
01:32:43.331 --> 01:32:48.250
Here's the one where he's checked.
Yeah,

1552
01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:53.100
dudes do this all the time.
Chris Tufts is in ski.
So I was on camera and I said,

1553
01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:57.720
oops,
wait.
He says,
oh look.

1554
01:32:57.730 --> 01:32:59.290
He even said something on that end of it.

1555
01:32:59.790 --> 01:33:01.420
<v 2>Um,
one guy,
uh,</v>

1556
01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:06.150
actually got a rape charge from a wrestling match.
Apparently.

1557
01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:07.650
What,
when was this?

1558
01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:12.510
17 year old Jerome hunt faces 21 counts of rape and attempted rape.

1559
01:33:12.810 --> 01:33:16.110
Each count carries with him up to 25 years in prison.

1560
01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:20.970
Hunt's lawyer Mike Butler crank claims that complaints came from fellow Parker

1561
01:33:20.971 --> 01:33:25.620
wrestlers who were simply victims of a legitimate wrestling move bottler.

1562
01:33:25.621 --> 01:33:29.400
Just file a motion to move the case of juvenile court on that court document.

1563
01:33:29.401 --> 01:33:32.760
He lays out a lot of information presented to the grand jury before they

1564
01:33:32.761 --> 01:33:36.690
indicted hunt on the rape charges while he's indicted on the rape charges.

1565
01:33:37.710 --> 01:33:40.020
Wow.
Former state champion wrestler.

1566
01:33:40.021 --> 01:33:44.370
Jerome Hunt's lawyer says that all but two of the incidents reported happened in

1567
01:33:44.371 --> 01:33:47.310
the Parker high school wrestling room before the practice.

1568
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:52.410
During last year's wrestling session.
Before practice.
Before practice.

1569
01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.090
Before practice rape.
Yeah.

1570
01:33:54.091 --> 01:33:58.230
It possibly came from a wrestling move called a but drag or skinning.
Okay.

1571
01:33:58.231 --> 01:34:01.710
Before practice,
what is dragging before practice?

1572
01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:05.040
It's not something illegal or not being taught.

1573
01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:08.700
It's being taught all over one accuser even testified to a grand jury.

1574
01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:10.470
I didn't take it as a sexual move.

1575
01:34:10.530 --> 01:34:14.540
I took it as him just messing around La who?

1576
01:34:14.570 --> 01:34:17.760
Who charged him then a prude.
Hmm.

1577
01:34:18.210 --> 01:34:22.680
This is interesting because that is the oil check is like a legitimate wrestling

1578
01:34:22.681 --> 01:34:24.300
move.
If that's what he's doing.

1579
01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:28.080
It's like people have been doing whether or not you think they should be able to

1580
01:34:28.081 --> 01:34:29.880
do that.
I don't think they should be able to do that,

1581
01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:33.660
but people have been doing that for a long time.

1582
01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:37.870
Like an actual legitimate wrestling like bill,
look up oil check wrestling,

1583
01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:42.450
find a video for oil check wrestling because that's something that guys have

1584
01:34:42.451 --> 01:34:44.160
done like for a long time.

1585
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:47.080
<v 8>I mean,
I would even say that's like gladiator days.</v>

1586
01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:50.170
I'm sure they did that it's not the most effective way to control whole

1587
01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:50.531
<v 2>person.</v>

1588
01:34:50.531 --> 01:34:54.790
So it's not like something that someone does for a long time or on a regular

1589
01:34:54.791 --> 01:34:58.100
basis.
It's just when you're in a match with someone,
what

1590
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.710
<v 0>you're trying to do is win.
And if you spend time fingering is,</v>

1591
01:35:00.711 --> 01:35:04.070
but you could've been doing other things that would actually get you to win the

1592
01:35:04.071 --> 01:35:06.700
match.
So it's not like something that comes up all the time.
Yeah,

1593
01:35:06.710 --> 01:35:10.660
I call that a Friday.
But um,

1594
01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:15.560
some people,
uh,
you know some people who don't know wrestling,

1595
01:35:15.561 --> 01:35:19.370
who found out that this guy's oil checking people and you know,

1596
01:35:19.371 --> 01:35:23.510
maybe being a dick about it.
Hey,
Johnny's oil checking people.

1597
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:28.580
No,
fine.
Just what is this?
No,
no,
no,
no.
Not checking the oil crisis.

1598
01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:33.510
Oil check.
Image oil check.
Wrestling,
checking oil.
Just listening.

1599
01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:35.450
Google oil check wrestling.

1600
01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:37.940
<v 11>Yeah.
I got some money.
That was about it though.</v>

1601
01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:48.990
<v 0>I'm going to but drag you so you ain't safe.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1602
01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:52.430
Si.
Si.

1603
01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:54.810
Totally legal.

1604
01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:58.080
See how he's doing this and the referee's not getting angry at him and no one's

1605
01:35:58.081 --> 01:36:01.740
going to jail.
See this is,
it is actually illegal wrestling move.

1606
01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:05.820
That guy putting his hands in.
That guy's an asshole.
Like that is totally legal.

1607
01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.210
Not only is it totally legal,
it's so common.

1608
01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:14.190
Who made this video?
Like who,
who is like,
you know what I'm going to do today?

1609
01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:18.210
Like I said,
it's,
it's common,
but it's not the most common thing

1610
01:36:19.770 --> 01:36:22.780
like wrestling.
It's all about though.
It makes sense.

1611
01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:25.270
It's not the best way to control a guy all the time though.

1612
01:36:25.271 --> 01:36:30.220
So when it does come up,
guys do it,
but it's not like the only way to do it.

1613
01:36:30.221 --> 01:36:31.690
And it's not like if you,

1614
01:36:31.691 --> 01:36:34.480
if you concentrate on that when you should be doing something else,

1615
01:36:34.481 --> 01:36:36.560
you're going to lose the wrestling match.
So it's not,
he's,

1616
01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.410
what he's doing is using it as a whole.

1617
01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:42.010
He's literally trying to grapple by holding onto the guy like that.

1618
01:36:42.011 --> 01:36:44.890
He's not necessarily cycle.

1619
01:36:45.130 --> 01:36:48.790
He might be sexual or you might also be trying to inflict pain and discomfort,

1620
01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:52.290
but it's been going on forever.
Oh,
those damn oil checkers.

1621
01:36:52.330 --> 01:36:55.570
I sort of take this one kid and calm a rapist for that stuff.

1622
01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:59.920
But the other thing was then said Doris before practice.

1623
01:37:00.130 --> 01:37:03.880
That's a problem that before practice that that disturbs me.
Like,
wait a minute,

1624
01:37:03.881 --> 01:37:06.430
wait and wait a minute.
Like hours before practice,

1625
01:37:06.431 --> 01:37:10.840
like five minutes before practice.
Or you're warming up in the locker room like,

1626
01:37:10.841 --> 01:37:14.500
hey,
check this out.
You're going over techniques.
What is the exact,

1627
01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:17.140
what exactly is going on and how many counts does it say?

1628
01:37:17.141 --> 01:37:20.770
Like it wasn't just one person.
I think they said like 40 Jesus.
Yeah,

1629
01:37:20.890 --> 01:37:25.120
it's 40 people or 40 40 a churches.
Well,
I'll read it again.
Well,

1630
01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.500
I shouldn't talk about this kid.
And by the way,
this was a several years ago,

1631
01:37:30.010 --> 01:37:34.920
2006 actually,
but I'm 21 counts.
Wow.
Yeah.

1632
01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:38.050
That if,
if you know,
I don't know what that kid did,

1633
01:37:38.051 --> 01:37:41.230
so I'm just talking about in my ass.
But if the kid did what's in those videos,

1634
01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:45.040
you better go watch those videos because there's videos of people doing that,

1635
01:37:45.130 --> 01:37:47.530
but drag or oil check forever.

1636
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:50.140
It's been going on for as long as he's been wrestling.

1637
01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.040
It's just not the most effective thing to do always.
It's not in every match,

1638
01:37:54.490 --> 01:37:57.490
but shit,
it's pretty fucking common.
Yeah.
You know,

1639
01:37:58.290 --> 01:38:02.400
and then they butt plugs.
That doesn't help,
dude.
Stupid idea.

1640
01:38:02.401 --> 01:38:04.140
It's just going to go deeper in and you bleed.

1641
01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:06.990
It's not going to stop the guy from holding onto it.

1642
01:38:07.170 --> 01:38:10.740
Get a little tail on the end.
Yeah.
It's God.
Good idea.
Make it a decorative,

1643
01:38:10.741 --> 01:38:13.240
but pull that out and the guy gets embarrassing.
It's happened.

1644
01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:18.780
A loud pop pop.
It's like,
sorry about that.
Uh,

1645
01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:23.190
I take that,
oh,
there's me,
but did I hear that?
Um,

1646
01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:26.790
Brock Lesner is thinking about coming back to the UFC.
Yeah.
That's bullshit.
Yeah,

1647
01:38:26.791 --> 01:38:31.200
that's bullshit.
They,
there's one hype story when they were trying to hype it up,

1648
01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:34.110
uh,
because the WWE was saying that Brock Lesnar was in Vegas.

1649
01:38:34.111 --> 01:38:35.610
They may might have big announcement,

1650
01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:39.270
but it's really just a publicity move to talk about Brock Lesnar's wrestling

1651
01:38:39.271 --> 01:38:41.970
appearance.
So there was a little bit of hype on that.

1652
01:38:42.150 --> 01:38:45.300
Some guys tweeting me that the,
but drag does not go into the butthole.
Um,

1653
01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:50.090
yes it does,
sir.
Sometimes drag does not go into there saying it's a,

1654
01:38:50.110 --> 01:38:52.830
there's a nerve back there pulling.
Yeah,
you're right.

1655
01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:56.610
But tell me the dude's don't sometimes put fingers in people's assholes.
Hey,

1656
01:38:56.611 --> 01:39:00.450
if I had,
if I can for sure,
dude,
cause I've had it happen.
So shut your mouth.

1657
01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:05.830
Don't tell me that oil checks don't go in your asshole.
I've had it happen.

1658
01:39:05.831 --> 01:39:10.080
Sneaky.
Creepy fingers.
Do's,
oil.
Jag,
you on a,
on a graph you're going to like,

1659
01:39:10.081 --> 01:39:13.770
just rub it like around,
you know it's,
there you go.
You go in.

1660
01:39:14.670 --> 01:39:18.270
It's not like,
oh,
I'm sorry there.
There's different people.
Look at this.

1661
01:39:18.271 --> 01:39:20.370
This is a nice one right there.
That's

1662
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:26.880
definitely now those women,
is that Bobby?
Yes.
It's a woman.
Oh,
it is a woman.

1663
01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:30.900
That might be Felicia.
Oh,
I don't know who that is.
It might be my friend Felicia.

1664
01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:35.700
She's a bad ass grappler.
Okay,
that's fine.
She
is not right.

1665
01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.570
These are the,
uh,
that guy's an asshole.
Yeah.
That,

1666
01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:43.350
that's the oil wrestling that like Russian oil.
Respill Turkish,
Turkish wars.

1667
01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:46.770
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

1668
01:39:46.890 --> 01:39:49.620
Anybody who says it doesn't go in your asshole shut it.

1669
01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:54.030
He's clearly looking at that and just being like,
you fucking well,
you know,

1670
01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:58.570
it doesn't always go in.
Sometimes it just hits the taint sometimes.
Uh,

1671
01:39:58.590 --> 01:40:00.060
it's just that that would hurt.
That would hurt.

1672
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:05.040
Got a good grip on the upper deck and it doesn't actually get in the asshole in

1673
01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:09.060
the lit up,
pulling the lit up on the macaroni and cheese container.

1674
01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:13.800
Just get the steam out.
Yeah,
just Tupperware in that motherfucker.

1675
01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:17.040
But sometimes it goes in the asshole.

1676
01:40:17.130 --> 01:40:20.190
There's a lot of fucking butthurt wrestling guys out there that are arguing with

1677
01:40:20.191 --> 01:40:24.180
me right now on Twitter.
We just showed you photos.
You fucks.
You're in denial.

1678
01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:27.150
There's a lot of guys who have had their assholes finger who were like,

1679
01:40:27.151 --> 01:40:31.120
thank you Joe for speaking up.
Bullshit did even go,
gosh,

1680
01:40:31.230 --> 01:40:35.820
it can't go in,
dude.
It's a trap.
My holes like a bank vault.

1681
01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:40.050
Nothing's.
Then you might be knocking on the door.
You can knock on my door.

1682
01:40:40.051 --> 01:40:42.750
Does that mean you sleep in my house?
No,
it does not mean you sleep in my house.

1683
01:40:42.751 --> 01:40:45.180
You just knocking on my door.
You can't get in.
I think it's time.

1684
01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:50.040
If you have had your butthole invaded by finger to come out and shows the brown

1685
01:40:50.041 --> 01:40:54.670
stuff,
fish of security,
nothing.
Nothing gets through.

1686
01:40:54.671 --> 01:40:59.671
It's tight like that fucking went event horizon when it opened up the time for

1687
01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:03.970
favorite scary movie ever.
That's my favorite scary movie of all time.

1688
01:41:03.971 --> 01:41:08.200
I'm so glad you said that.
Fucking good,
scary,
terrifying movie.
Whew.
Yeah.

1689
01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:12.200
The idea that they run into hell.
Ooh
enough.

1690
01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:16.210
Brian enough.
E and u f.
F.

1691
01:41:16.211 --> 01:41:19.870
What are you showing more guys with hands?
Dude's ass holes.
I think we get it.

1692
01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:22.840
Yeah.
Brian,
it happens.
Wrestling fans.

1693
01:41:22.841 --> 01:41:26.710
I know you don't like to believe it happens,
but it happens.
Oh yeah.

1694
01:41:26.711 --> 01:41:30.730
That was real too.
It's all real.
That's different.

1695
01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:36.930
That's just two men standing their ground with their lips locked and trying to

1696
01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:42.100
gain an advantage.
Making Valentine's Day plan.
By the way,
that White Guy,
one

1697
01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:46.900
white guy won that one as much to the dismay of black people everywhere.

1698
01:41:46.930 --> 01:41:50.950
Should have,
but check them much to dismay of Anderson Silva fans.

1699
01:41:51.670 --> 01:41:56.350
Much dismay of people don't like wrestling or checks,
oil checks,
drags,

1700
01:41:56.420 --> 01:42:00.340
but tracks.
I'm sure Chris Weidman has been oil checked some time in his life.

1701
01:42:00.370 --> 01:42:04.540
Last name like Weidman is how you make an animal like that.
Why?
Why?

1702
01:42:04.810 --> 01:42:09.340
How dare you?
How dare you?

1703
01:42:10.510 --> 01:42:15.280
What is this a parody?
Can we play your parody video?
It's called not looking,

1704
01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:18.290
not looking as fake.
Brian Stout,

1705
01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.290
what Jesus buying believes everything.
Twin Towers.
Fucking black helicopters.

1706
01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.420
That's just naked.

1707
01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:30.330
So this is a parody of what's the show called?
Names.

1708
01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:34.960
<v 8>[inaudible] hit series looking and we did a hit series.</v>

1709
01:42:34.961 --> 01:42:37.780
I never know what's on the third episode.
Yeah,
say it's a hit series,

1710
01:42:37.781 --> 01:42:41.260
but that's my friend drew and a WHO's a funny guy from the Groundlings and we

1711
01:42:41.261 --> 01:42:45.340
did an la spoof because of the San Francisco trailer or the trailer they do for

1712
01:42:45.341 --> 01:42:48.940
this one.
Oh,
I can't play the San Francisco one.
They're all just like,

1713
01:42:48.941 --> 01:42:51.550
it's so weird being in your thirties like one of them was like,

1714
01:42:51.551 --> 01:42:53.620
what's uncircumcised mean?
And I'm like,
what?

1715
01:42:53.650 --> 01:42:57.010
Where are you're in San Francisco and you don't know what uncircumcised means.

1716
01:42:57.430 --> 01:43:00.550
So we did a spoof on it.
It's like a minute and a half and it was,

1717
01:43:00.610 --> 01:43:04.600
we had a lot of fun doing it.
It's on funny or die.
How many,
what's it called?

1718
01:43:04.601 --> 01:43:06.060
What's the name of it?
That's it.
Um,

1719
01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:08.080
<v 0>if someone,</v>

1720
01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:09.040
<v 3>oh,
not looking.</v>

1721
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.410
Hey guys.

1722
01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:26.870
Oh,
the audio cutout did.
Yeah,

1723
01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:33.560
but I love this song.
Now the audio cut out.
What do you mean the words?

1724
01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:35.430
Oh,
there it is for your body.

1725
01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:40.750
That's the guy from Nashville,
the series

1726
01:43:43.730 --> 01:43:47.540
morning here.
This might be something that people have to see.
Yeah,

1727
01:43:47.541 --> 01:43:52.260
you got to see it.
Yeah.
Montage walk.
Are you point?

1728
01:43:52.510 --> 01:43:53.343
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

1729
01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:58.250
I'm hearing just one day to Lucia if I should be clenching my butthole right
now.

1730
01:43:58.251 --> 01:44:02.030
But the visuals that go along with this audio,
it's,
it was fun though.

1731
01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:05.690
And it's getting,
it's been on like it was on Huffington post this afternoon.

1732
01:44:05.691 --> 01:44:07.700
It's like kinda crazy.
It's weird.

1733
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:10.440
People who are Mike mildly homophobic because they're listening to that.

1734
01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:13.430
They would wonder whether or not this should clench.
Oh,
episode.

1735
01:44:13.431 --> 01:44:17.900
There's Iraqi soldiers pissed off or
Iraqi,

1736
01:44:17.901 --> 01:44:21.440
not American soldiers.
I don't give a fuck.
Okay.
Team America.

1737
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:22.880
Do you think at pissing off,

1738
01:44:22.881 --> 01:44:26.990
do you think of pissing off a lot of your listeners know?
Okay.
No.

1739
01:44:26.991 --> 01:44:31.730
Well listen,
I piss off by the first gay on this podcast.

1740
01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:35.250
Todd glass.
Benard I love Melissa.

1741
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:40.180
Melissa Etheridge,
Melissa Etheridge.

1742
01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:45.100
<v 2>Who else has been guiding?
It's been on um,
Brian Dunning,</v>

1743
01:44:45.101 --> 01:44:48.330
but for other reasons,
just being gay.
Yeah.
Wow.
Oh

1744
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:52.430
<v 8>well I'm a cool game.
So,
oh,
I'm this guy.</v>

1745
01:44:53.150 --> 01:44:58.070
What feminists guy.
Oh,
buck angel.
Angel Porn Star.
We got him.

1746
01:44:58.071 --> 01:45:02.870
But no,
the,
the one that rape culture guy.
Oh,
he's not gay.
How dare you?

1747
01:45:02.871 --> 01:45:06.050
He's married.
So was that the one you got into a fight with?

1748
01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:10.560
<v 2>No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I've had two arguments ever on this whole podcast.</v>

1749
01:45:10.561 --> 01:45:14.430
One was Brian Duffy,
you know,
it was Jamie.
But do the Jamie argument was,

1750
01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:19.260
it was based on,
um,
Daniel Tosh and Daniel tosh getting in trouble.

1751
01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:21.390
<v 8>Yes,
I remember.
I actually saw that episode.</v>

1752
01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:24.210
I've watched that one cause that was so it's when he,

1753
01:45:24.270 --> 01:45:25.890
when he made that rape joke and he was just

1754
01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:29.280
<v 2>trying to defend it or it was for it or something like that.</v>

1755
01:45:29.281 --> 01:45:31.090
And you guys just buried him to the ground,
didn't you?

1756
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:35.910
He didn't make a rape joke.
He was,
well he did in the past,
but it was a,

1757
01:45:35.911 --> 01:45:39.510
it was tosh saying a rape joke.
Some woman,

1758
01:45:39.690 --> 01:45:43.850
the story was touches at the laugh factory and he asks like,
uh,

1759
01:45:44.250 --> 01:45:45.570
what do you guys want to talk about?

1760
01:45:45.630 --> 01:45:49.470
And some guy yells out rape and then Tasha is going like,

1761
01:45:49.471 --> 01:45:52.740
what is funny about rapists?
You know,
like is it the humiliation?

1762
01:45:52.741 --> 01:45:54.630
Like what do you think 20 about rain?
And you know,

1763
01:45:54.631 --> 01:45:57.210
he's just trying to make fun out of this and someone when it goes,

1764
01:45:57.211 --> 01:45:59.010
actually nothing's funny about rape.
And he goes,

1765
01:45:59.011 --> 01:46:02.190
wouldn't it be funny if five guys raped right now?
That's right.
I remember that.

1766
01:46:02.250 --> 01:46:05.640
And then of course the whole crowd laughed cause it's a hilarious thing to say.

1767
01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:09.000
But this woman wrote a blog,
you got all these people freak out as a blogger.

1768
01:46:09.001 --> 01:46:10.950
And I wanted him to apologize.

1769
01:46:10.951 --> 01:46:15.900
And Jamie took the side of the heckler and,
uh,
I,
you know,
I said,

1770
01:46:15.901 --> 01:46:16.734
that's ridiculous.

1771
01:46:17.230 --> 01:46:22.110
It's so obvious that it was a joke and there's all this idea of trigger
warnings.

1772
01:46:22.111 --> 01:46:25.390
And the,
a real problem with that show wasn't,

1773
01:46:25.391 --> 01:46:27.030
it wasn't even the two people disagreed.

1774
01:46:27.031 --> 01:46:30.330
It was like his depiction of it afterwards was,
you know,

1775
01:46:30.331 --> 01:46:34.500
I think people forget how things actually went sometimes and then they start,

1776
01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:37.310
they give their version of it and then,
you know,

1777
01:46:37.311 --> 01:46:40.470
get to go back and look at the actual words that were said and then their

1778
01:46:40.471 --> 01:46:44.070
version of it and it makes them look deceptive.
Right.

1779
01:46:44.071 --> 01:46:47.370
Sometimes it's not even that they're actually deceptive.
What it is,

1780
01:46:47.371 --> 01:46:51.060
is that there's a lot of people out there that are this Brian Dunning guy that

1781
01:46:51.061 --> 01:46:54.960
we're talking about that we had that podcast with his depiction of our podcast

1782
01:46:54.961 --> 01:46:59.961
and me being a nine 11 truther when I clearly said I wasn't as clear as

1783
01:47:01.081 --> 01:47:05.490
possible,
but he still thinks that somehow or another,
it's a supporting,

1784
01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:09.120
some sort of,
um,
some sort of conspiracy theories.

1785
01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:12.220
What are you throwing up that's distracting me?
That was the Jamie kills things.

1786
01:47:12.221 --> 01:47:14.790
The latest CD.
He has a track called dude,

1787
01:47:14.791 --> 01:47:19.680
Bros get super mad when you say rape is bad.
Oh wait,
he's still on it.

1788
01:47:19.681 --> 01:47:24.450
He won't,
he won't let it go.
Yeah,
he says,
I listened to it.
You don't buy it.

1789
01:47:24.451 --> 01:47:28.770
You just listen to it on Spotify.
I don't want to hear it.
Who Says Dude Bros?

1790
01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:32.250
Well it's,
that's a way of diminishing anybody who has a contrary opinion,

1791
01:47:32.730 --> 01:47:35.610
but the idea being bros like men who uh,

1792
01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:38.160
or like idiot proof and masculine,

1793
01:47:38.161 --> 01:47:42.880
the rest of new way to diminish people's opinions like that.
Your Bros.
Oh,

1794
01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:44.660
there they are.
All bros.
Yeah.

1795
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:49.200
This is what the type of thing that people do if they want to diminish you

1796
01:47:49.201 --> 01:47:52.470
without just talking about what the actual subject is.

1797
01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:56.430
It's not the people get upset if you say,
don't say rape.
That's not what it is.

1798
01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.650
People get upset if you're hypocritical.

1799
01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:03.680
People get upset if you tell a distorted depiction of the actual events and make

1800
01:48:04.201 --> 01:48:07.980
it so that it favors your point of view.
And then you were attack and victimize.

1801
01:48:08.190 --> 01:48:11.580
People have a real problem in this country with people that play the victim
role.

1802
01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:12.713
And um,

1803
01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:16.260
a lot of people do it by default and they might not even realize they're doing

1804
01:48:16.261 --> 01:48:20.400
it by default,
but they do.
They go into this,
you know,

1805
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:23.490
I was victimized.
These guys got mad at me because I did this.

1806
01:48:23.850 --> 01:48:27.120
It might not be that you might've done something annoying.
You know,
there's,

1807
01:48:27.170 --> 01:48:30.150
and it's also like,
why do people relish?

1808
01:48:30.151 --> 01:48:34.020
So like being in these disputes and these debates with people where they,

1809
01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:37.890
they feel like they're going to lash out and right or wrong,

1810
01:48:38.410 --> 01:48:42.990
because nobody wants to be wrong.
No one wants to be wrong.
Yeah,
that's true.

1811
01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:46.890
Because it's embarrassing.
It's belittling.
It's,
you know,

1812
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:51.240
you definitely right there,
people will fight to prove how right they are.

1813
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:54.570
But the problem is when you do that,
if you fucking,

1814
01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:59.370
there's a recording of you being wrong.
God Damn,
that makes you look bad,

1815
01:48:59.430 --> 01:49:03.900
Brian.
Dunning's God damn,
that makes us look bad.
It makes you look bad.

1816
01:49:03.930 --> 01:49:07.050
Just it's bad for you.
It's bad for your thinking,

1817
01:49:07.051 --> 01:49:10.620
it's bad for your mind when you give a distorted depiction of the events and

1818
01:49:10.621 --> 01:49:14.910
people can clearly see that they go,
oh,
this guy's brains broken,
right?

1819
01:49:14.911 --> 01:49:18.780
This guy is so warped by ego.
He doesn't see what actually happened.

1820
01:49:18.810 --> 01:49:23.580
And it's clearly still not over it.
And still like Jamie.

1821
01:49:23.581 --> 01:49:25.040
Yeah,
Jamie's a comic.

1822
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:29.190
You like Jamie's also a progressive guy and he's trying to do the right thing.

1823
01:49:29.190 --> 01:49:34.170
And I,
I don't,
I don't have any problem with Jamie.
I like him.
I really do.

1824
01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:36.870
And he's a,
he's an odd guy.
We don't agree on a lot of things,

1825
01:49:36.871 --> 01:49:38.610
but I think he's a good person.
I really do.

1826
01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:44.060
I just think that like these depictions of a,

1827
01:49:45.181 --> 01:49:47.860
of this,
the scenario,
it's like very,

1828
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:52.480
there's like this a very progressive point of view that is like very rigid.

1829
01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:54.160
And then there's this,
uh,

1830
01:49:54.190 --> 01:49:59.190
this other point of view that either is like super douchey masculine that hates

1831
01:49:59.651 --> 01:50:01.150
the progressive point of view.

1832
01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:06.420
And then there's moderates that sort of get lumped into that Super Douchey Matt

1833
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:11.440
Macho frame of mind just because they disagree with like the Uber Progressive

1834
01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:14.200
Point of view.
And I don't think it's that black and white,
you know,

1835
01:50:14.201 --> 01:50:16.900
I think especially with something like rape jokes,

1836
01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:19.570
like all rape jokes aren't funny.

1837
01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:21.880
The only rape jokes that are funny or funny ones,

1838
01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:24.700
just like all murder jokes aren't funny.

1839
01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:27.400
The only funny murder jokes are funny murder jokes.

1840
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:28.250
That's the ones that are funny.

1841
01:50:28.250 --> 01:50:30.700
Just like all jokes about fucking ice cream aren't funny.

1842
01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:33.010
And if you tell me a bad joke about ice cream,

1843
01:50:33.011 --> 01:50:36.550
it's more offensive than a good rape joke.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Sorry,

1844
01:50:36.730 --> 01:50:40.430
I'm sorry the people don't want to hear that.
But I see oak about race.

1845
01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:41.111
See what you're saying.

1846
01:50:41.111 --> 01:50:44.800
That he was a part of life and it's not a good part of life.
It's awful.

1847
01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:46.480
And it's not something you should promote.

1848
01:50:46.481 --> 01:50:51.481
But the idea that saying a joke about rape somehow another promotes rape is

1849
01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:56.620
crazy.
It's a joke.
And the idea that it becomes a part of this culture.
Yeah.
No,

1850
01:50:56.710 --> 01:50:59.020
it's crazy too.
It's not,
it's not a culture of rape.

1851
01:50:59.050 --> 01:51:01.840
There's assholes that commit rape in our culture.
Yeah,

1852
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:06.420
<v 8>yeah.
I do a joke about,
uh,
uh,
having a rape whistle and,
uh,</v>

1853
01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:07.741
it didn't work.

1854
01:51:07.741 --> 01:51:10.940
No one will to know it does like it because it's a very visual thing,

1855
01:51:10.941 --> 01:51:15.260
like a talk.
It's,
it's a,
it's you have to get checked,
man.
See it.
But,
um,
but I do,

1856
01:51:15.261 --> 01:51:18.560
I act it out.
Like I,
I grab it off my nightstand and I just go,

1857
01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:20.690
<v 5>okay.</v>

1858
01:51:20.690 --> 01:51:24.390
<v 8>And it's a visual and everyone dies.
Guys,
girls.
It's one of those things.</v>

1859
01:51:24.391 --> 01:51:27.060
And I'm like,
but that's the thing,
I'm blowing a rape whistle.

1860
01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:30.630
I never get like that,
like backlash.
I mean it's,

1861
01:51:30.631 --> 01:51:33.780
anything's a joke now I get offended.
I mean people ask me,

1862
01:51:33.781 --> 01:51:36.840
cause a lot of people talk about like gay people on stage and gay jokes and

1863
01:51:36.841 --> 01:51:37.674
stuff like that.

1864
01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:43.220
And I don't get offended at them because I know it's part of the business.

1865
01:51:43.681 --> 01:51:46.800
It's one of those,
I mean,
how many times do I hear the n word on stage?

1866
01:51:46.801 --> 01:51:50.870
How many times do I hear everything?
It's part of who we are.
I will if I,

1867
01:51:50.871 --> 01:51:53.960
if it's a bad joke and if I think it's unnecessary,
yeah,
I'll,

1868
01:51:53.970 --> 01:51:56.610
I'll say something and be like,
hey,
that kind of didn't work.

1869
01:51:56.670 --> 01:51:59.310
But at the same time,
I think those jokes are kind of

1870
01:52:00.650 --> 01:52:01.470
<v 5>okay.</v>

1871
01:52:01.470 --> 01:52:06.330
<v 8>Winding down now.
Cause I mean if you say anything about,
I mean I've heard,</v>

1872
01:52:06.331 --> 01:52:10.140
I mean I've heard the word fag on stage and like you'll hear that the audience

1873
01:52:10.141 --> 01:52:12.180
just quiet,

1874
01:52:12.181 --> 01:52:16.950
just a death eater just sucked out all the life they were very aware of.

1875
01:52:17.610 --> 01:52:21.360
So that's Kinda cool cause I like that whole progressive mentality.
I mean,

1876
01:52:21.361 --> 01:52:24.030
you can say gay people,
you're whatever,
but it's like,

1877
01:52:24.031 --> 01:52:26.420
it's like you can't say that word now.
It's like,
ah,

1878
01:52:26.710 --> 01:52:30.370
<v 2>if Kennison did that old bit that he did about aids,
do you remember that?</v>

1879
01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:35.350
Kennison bit.
Vaguely.
I,
he had a bit about aids.
Um,
it was,

1880
01:52:35.351 --> 01:52:37.540
uh,
it was really controversial.
Yeah.

1881
01:52:37.610 --> 01:52:40.570
And it got him in a lot of troubles with his second album and he was like,

1882
01:52:40.571 --> 01:52:43.900
just because a few fags fucked a monkey,

1883
01:52:44.710 --> 01:52:45.770
I got to wear a condom

1884
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:50.960
<v 0>and you know,
but that was the time.
That was the time.
But it was um,
you know,</v>

1885
01:52:50.961 --> 01:52:54.410
he was talking about how aids is,
uh,
you know,
the age is a gay disease.

1886
01:52:54.411 --> 01:52:56.510
Like they say,
hey,
it's a heterosexual disease.

1887
01:52:56.810 --> 01:53:00.680
Straight guys can guide to straight guys can dice the die to Sam.

1888
01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:03.830
And he was like,
name one fucking guy.

1889
01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:09.740
It's not our dance.
Just cause a few facts.
Fuck dumb monkey.

1890
01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:14.150
That's good impression.
It wasn't really good.
The person,
it's not that good.

1891
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:15.470
It'd be better if I heard them.

1892
01:53:15.471 --> 01:53:19.160
There's a dude that does the stern show used to do it.
Oh,
Craig glass.
Yeah.

1893
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:23.330
He does the most insane.
This impression.
You think Kennison is in the room.

1894
01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:26.040
Like if you closed your eyes you would really Kennison it's,
it's,

1895
01:53:26.041 --> 01:53:31.010
it's really quite freaky.
That guy does spooky impressions.
But,
um,

1896
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:36.230
yeah,
people are definitely becoming more and more sensitive to these things.

1897
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:40.970
People were upset at me this weekend because I said that I was a retard.
Uh,

1898
01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:44.660
during a broadcast.
I,
I was talking to you a favor.
Uriah faber fought,

1899
01:53:46.130 --> 01:53:50.030
he fought Hanan Barao for the bantamweight title and Browse one of the best

1900
01:53:50.031 --> 01:53:52.610
fighters in the planet and Brown,
it hurt your right and your rise as well.

1901
01:53:52.611 --> 01:53:56.990
But he hurt Uriah pretty bad in the first round and the referee stopped the

1902
01:53:56.991 --> 01:54:00.980
fight early.
Uriah was still trying to recover and he was hanging on.

1903
01:54:00.981 --> 01:54:03.290
He was given the referee the thumbs up telling me it's okay.

1904
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:06.590
The referee stopped the fight and the crowd went nuts and bolts like it's over.

1905
01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:10.580
It's over.
But he was,
he was definitely hurt,

1906
01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:14.090
but it was a premature stoppage and most people agree that it was a big mistake.

1907
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:18.040
So,
uh,
I was in the octagon and I was interviewing your Ryan.

1908
01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:22.880
I felt real bad for the guy.
I mean,
this was like a huge opportunity for him.

1909
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:27.020
The fight got stopped early and he's known as being like a really tough guy.

1910
01:54:27.021 --> 01:54:29.420
They could bounce back and you know,
he just,
you could see like,

1911
01:54:29.421 --> 01:54:33.380
he really felt disappointed that the fight ended the way it ended.
And,
uh,

1912
01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:36.500
he was bringing up his teammates and uh,
I said,

1913
01:54:36.501 --> 01:54:38.900
what about Chad Mendez who was actually in the wrong way class?
And he goes,

1914
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:42.560
he's in a different way cos I go,
I want to like,
you're right.
I'm a retard.

1915
01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:45.680
That's what I said while I was interviewing him,
when people would just like,

1916
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:49.460
you know,
I guess I shouldn't have said no,
you shouldn't say that on television.

1917
01:54:49.461 --> 01:54:52.730
It's not,
you know,
quote unquote professional.
Um,

1918
01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:56.840
I only said it because I was,
you know,
I was flustered.

1919
01:54:56.870 --> 01:55:00.260
I was into this thing where I felt bad for the guy and I didn't know what to say

1920
01:55:00.261 --> 01:55:01.490
and mean.
What am I going to say?
The Guy,

1921
01:55:01.491 --> 01:55:06.491
the guy just had this dream that got me 34 years of age and I did say the wrong

1922
01:55:06.801 --> 01:55:10.130
name.
I did,
I did give the wrong way class house,
which is very unusual for me.

1923
01:55:10.131 --> 01:55:13.160
I'm usually really good at that stuff.
Uh,
but you know,

1924
01:55:13.161 --> 01:55:15.980
you can only have so much information in your fucking brain and sometimes it

1925
01:55:15.981 --> 01:55:19.130
gets shuffled around and sometimes it gets shuffled around on the fly,

1926
01:55:19.131 --> 01:55:20.840
on television and you fuck up.

1927
01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:23.450
So I call myself a retard because I'm a self deprecating person.

1928
01:55:23.451 --> 01:55:25.580
If everyone lost their mind,
well there's some people got upset at it.

1929
01:55:25.581 --> 01:55:28.490
I shouldn't have used retard and they're right.
I absolutely shouldn't have.

1930
01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:31.190
You're,
you're 100% right.
I apologize for using it,

1931
01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:34.490
but I do use that word all the time.
And um,

1932
01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:38.360
I use that all the time too about myself and it's self deprecating way.

1933
01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:39.710
I could call myself an idiot.

1934
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:44.640
The idea that I'm calling myself retarded as if retarded a disease like down

1935
01:55:44.641 --> 01:55:48.420
syndrome is the disease.
I'm not saying I have down syndrome,
I'm saying retarded.

1936
01:55:48.421 --> 01:55:53.070
Like I'm slow.
Like I'm,
I mean that is not an technical medical term.

1937
01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:57.720
And when I'm using it to describe myself in a derogatory manner of being an

1938
01:55:57.721 --> 01:56:00.240
idiot,
I'm not going to listen to you.
Okay.

1939
01:56:00.241 --> 01:56:02.430
I'm going to keep calling myself a retard,
I think.

1940
01:56:02.730 --> 01:56:07.720
I think that is so silly that we're getting so fucking minute with our,

1941
01:56:07.750 --> 01:56:12.510
our fucking criticisms of people.
You can't call yourself a retard is a new one.

1942
01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:14.430
It's one thing.
If you call yourself a nigger,
I be like,

1943
01:56:14.431 --> 01:56:17.220
you might not want to do that.
Yeah.
It seems like people can get offended.

1944
01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:17.971
<v 8>I just like Mike.</v>

1945
01:56:17.971 --> 01:56:20.960
My balls just went inside me when you said it was ruined my own argument.

1946
01:56:20.961 --> 01:56:24.440
Maybe I just through my own argument,
there's a new argument right there.

1947
01:56:24.441 --> 01:56:27.620
I did didn't,
I kind of crushed my own argument in a way I did.

1948
01:56:27.810 --> 01:56:30.270
<v 0>Why?
Why should I be able to say call myself a retard?</v>

1949
01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:34.530
Retard is offensive to call someone else a retard.
Is it though the word?

1950
01:56:34.531 --> 01:56:37.590
The words totally taboo.
Now maybe there's a new one.

1951
01:56:37.710 --> 01:56:42.510
There's the new word transgender.
No.
Well,
yeah.
Twink no,

1952
01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:43.653
I remember that.

1953
01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:47.510
<v 8>You can call and got in trouble for saying Twain.
You can say twink.
Yes you can.</v>

1954
01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:50.620
You're going to get me in trouble.
Everyone all at once.

1955
01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:56.350
Um,
Andy Cohen from Bravo Rao.
Andy,
come on.

1956
01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:00.530
Who is gay by the way?
He was telling me now,

1957
01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:02.540
but it's for the people who don't know.
Yeah,
Andy.
Yeah.

1958
01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:05.650
Twink and he had apologized.
That's bullshit.
I call,

1959
01:57:05.651 --> 01:57:10.570
I mean I got my brother Andy on this one.
I mean that's,
that's,
that is not,

1960
01:57:10.900 --> 01:57:15.400
that is a group of people that,
that name has been,

1961
01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:20.110
was developed for the gay community.
That's like a twink is,

1962
01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:21.910
is there's twink and bear.

1963
01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:26.200
Then you shouldn't say bear then you shouldn't say odder than you shouldn't say

1964
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.380
his lap.
Come back.
I don't know what there is him saying.

1965
01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:34.630
<v 0>Twink like a black guy using the word nigger.
No,
no,</v>

1966
01:57:34.890 --> 01:57:39.490
it's not twink tweak is not offensive.
No,
it's Kinda cute.

1967
01:57:39.810 --> 01:57:41.340
<v 8>I get,
you know,
I get called,</v>

1968
01:57:41.410 --> 01:57:45.420
I like to do is I'd like to think of myself as an older twink.
I'm a Twang call.

1969
01:57:45.421 --> 01:57:49.200
You're told Twan Twinkies.
I'm actually no animal.

1970
01:57:49.201 --> 01:57:53.070
If anybody from the death squad family could classify me as an animal,
I will.

1971
01:57:53.071 --> 01:57:56.760
I will go through your choices and establish myself as starting that.
No,

1972
01:57:56.761 --> 01:58:01.650
but Gabori cabaret.
CITA bay.
What precious.
The girlfriend,

1973
01:58:01.651 --> 01:58:05.970
precious Gabba cabaret said,
obey my friend.
Fred would know that by the way.

1974
01:58:06.090 --> 01:58:09.180
Well not really.
I have some of my friends who call her Anamae Cinnabon,

1975
01:58:09.181 --> 01:58:11.190
which I think is actually kind of a,
a fun name.

1976
01:58:11.191 --> 01:58:15.510
But she got into trouble because she used the word trainee repeatedly on our,

1977
01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:20.100
I think it was our scenario,
but she,
she was just dropping it left and right.

1978
01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:23.280
And that's one of those words to me,
cause that's,

1979
01:58:23.281 --> 01:58:26.160
I think that's the new word that everyone's like,
you can't say that now.

1980
01:58:26.190 --> 01:58:31.080
You can't say that word.
I've been hearing that word for years.

1981
01:58:31.081 --> 01:58:33.450
I've heard transsexual people,

1982
01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:38.480
transgender people using that word I've [inaudible] but they're trying because

1983
01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:42.670
it's one of those things were the transgender community trying to make a very,

1984
01:58:42.671 --> 01:58:47.260
very poignant part and just be like,
we are part of this community.
You know,

1985
01:58:47.290 --> 01:58:49.910
we're tired of it.
One of my,
one of my,
uh,

1986
01:58:50.710 --> 01:58:54.110
friends who was on Rupaul's drag race,
we actually did that podcast with,
uh,

1987
01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:56.950
with red band.
When Raja was it guests,

1988
01:58:57.010 --> 01:59:01.330
one of her drag queen contestants named Carmen Carrera,

1989
01:59:01.450 --> 01:59:06.430
who was gorgeous Gore.
Like,
pull up a picture of Carmen Carrera right now.

1990
01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:10.630
Don't do it.
It's got my sunglasses.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
That you turned to stone.

1991
01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:14.500
There is,
she's not Medusa.
If you're a straight guy.
No,
you're going to be like,

1992
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:20.320
but I'm transgendered is now picketing.
Not Picketing.
That's a horrible word.

1993
01:59:20.321 --> 01:59:25.321
She is trying to get Victoria secret to make her the first transgendered model.

1994
01:59:26.890 --> 01:59:30.730
So I think,
but I don't think the word,
I don't,
I,
I,
I hear the word training.

1995
01:59:30.731 --> 01:59:33.820
I've heard,
I've heard drag queens call each other trainings.
I just think it's,

1996
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:35.080
everyone's being very,
very centered.

1997
01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:35.361
<v 0>Well,</v>

1998
01:59:35.361 --> 01:59:39.800
people love to call you out on shit and they love to get you in something that

1999
01:59:39.801 --> 01:59:41.600
you were wrong.
That's a transgender chick.

2000
01:59:42.350 --> 01:59:46.250
<v 8>Yeah,
Carmen Carrera.
She's amazing.
I love her.</v>

2001
01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:50.150
Students have kind of a thick neck though.
Yeah.
But gorgeous.

2002
01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:54.200
I mean how deep their voice,
no,
it sounds like a girl.

2003
01:59:55.930 --> 02:00:00.740
She is a,
she's postop.
Um,
better.
No,

2004
02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:04.880
pre,
uh,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It has has boobs and everything,
but I think is,

2005
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:07.670
I don't know if it's had this,
if she's had the surgery or not,

2006
02:00:10.350 --> 02:00:11.680
the whole sheet on her.

2007
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:15.330
<v 0>If they haven't had the operation instead of like being a glass half empty,</v>

2008
02:00:15.450 --> 02:00:18.180
let's just call it the full package.
I've heard a lot of people are into that.

2009
02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:19.620
The full package.
Yeah,

2010
02:00:19.621 --> 02:00:23.940
I bet there's a lot of anime porn online with the full package.
Giant Dicks,

2011
02:00:23.970 --> 02:00:28.590
big fake titties.
And it's like,
what are you trying to fucking do?

2012
02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:35.150
What is going on and your seller,
what's your mixed message?
I know,
yeah,

2013
02:00:35.190 --> 02:00:37.650
she's stunning waiver.
We had a,
um,

2014
02:00:37.890 --> 02:00:42.890
a transgender woman on the man show and we had this thing,

2015
02:00:42.991 --> 02:00:47.120
her name was vanity.
We had to gea and vanity,
uh,

2016
02:00:47.290 --> 02:00:49.590
both very nice people,
but the,
the vanity chick,

2017
02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:54.480
we had this box attached to dude's dicks and the box was a,

2018
02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:58.990
let's say he goes to show you how stupid like sensors and like standards of

2019
02:00:58.991 --> 02:01:02.940
practices people are.
Doug and I,
we created this game show called make me hard.

2020
02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:05.490
And the,
the game show was you would,
uh,

2021
02:01:05.730 --> 02:01:08.340
you would have a box over your Dick and then we'd have a bunch of things happen

2022
02:01:08.341 --> 02:01:09.360
in front of you.
And then,
you know,

2023
02:01:09.361 --> 02:01:13.920
we obviously control whether the bulb lights up or not.
So like,
you know,

2024
02:01:13.921 --> 02:01:18.690
we have like a women dancing around.
Nothing.
A dude eaten a banana.

2025
02:01:18.691 --> 02:01:22.530
Obtaining ticking the box goes is like,
pretend you go.
That's cool.

2026
02:01:22.531 --> 02:01:26.550
That's good social experiment.
But it was fake.
It was obviously just a real one.

2027
02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:28.530
But here's where it gets fake.
Vin.

2028
02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:33.210
This vanity chick comes out and she's gorgeous.
I mean,
she's like a 10 and uh,

2029
02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:36.330
she's putting whipped cream on her nipples.
The Guy Sucking it off.

2030
02:01:36.331 --> 02:01:39.060
Everybody's going crazy,
but the light is not going on.

2031
02:01:39.310 --> 02:01:43.460
Then she pulls her pants down and she's got a deck and the whole crowd sees it

2032
02:01:43.461 --> 02:01:44.870
and goes fucking crazy.

2033
02:01:45.110 --> 02:01:49.910
It was the loudest sound of disappointment I've ever heard collectively from 300

2034
02:01:49.911 --> 02:01:50.744
men.

2035
02:01:51.220 --> 02:01:53.220
<v 12>Oh,</v>

2036
02:01:53.610 --> 02:01:57.080
<v 0>and of course,
that's when the light goes off.
This is dicks.
Hard as a rock,
right?</v>

2037
02:01:57.690 --> 02:02:00.340
It's silly.
It was silly.
But,
but it's true.
I've heard some,

2038
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:03.930
I've heard a lot of stories about people who are into that,

2039
02:02:03.931 --> 02:02:07.470
like straight bros.
What was silly was that you could say,

2040
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:10.560
you could have this girl pull your dick out.
Okay,

2041
02:02:10.561 --> 02:02:13.860
but what you couldn't do is say the word hard.
They wouldn't remove hard.

2042
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:15.630
They wanted it to be make me stiff.

2043
02:02:15.810 --> 02:02:18.990
They made us change the title stiff like make me hard.
It's just too offensive.

2044
02:02:19.050 --> 02:02:20.460
We're like,
what are you talking to?

2045
02:02:20.461 --> 02:02:23.760
If I think make me stiff is way more offensive than I just want to change.

2046
02:02:23.970 --> 02:02:28.140
So just morons,
moron.
Talk.
Just dummies.
Who want to go?

2047
02:02:28.170 --> 02:02:32.160
<v 13>What about move this around.
I want the lamp to be here.
Ooh,
I will.</v>

2048
02:02:32.250 --> 02:02:34.980
If the room didn't have the lamp pair,
the room wouldn't be the room.

2049
02:02:35.150 --> 02:02:36.870
I put the laughter in the room.

2050
02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:39.270
They were going to have no lamp and I made them put the lamp there.

2051
02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:41.790
I've walked in that room and I said,
it needs a lamp.
Well,

2052
02:02:41.791 --> 02:02:44.100
if you've always been good at figuring out what's wrong,
needs lamp,

2053
02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:48.390
that's my skill.
I might not be funny,
but I know where the funny belongs.

2054
02:02:48.391 --> 02:02:52.680
Can't say hard Yancy.
Yeah,
free.
God made a batter.
Who maybe better.

2055
02:02:52.681 --> 02:02:56.490
I put my greasy little fucking chubby doughnut fingers all over everything and

2056
02:02:56.491 --> 02:02:58.320
the butts oil check the oil check.
Yeah.

2057
02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:00.030
<v 0>The whole show.
But uh,</v>

2058
02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:02.920
the point is everybody in the audience before she pulled her dick out,

2059
02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:05.680
everybody in the audience thought it was the hottest bitch on the planet.
Yeah.

2060
02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:10.370
Beautiful Legs and beautiful face.
Long heroin.
Yep.

2061
02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:15.400
Boom.
Whoa.
Ooh,
epic thunder.
Ooh,

2062
02:03:15.450 --> 02:03:20.410
Ooh,
Ooh.
The schlong heard round the world.
Yeah.
But uh,

2063
02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:22.870
you're,
you're definitely right.
And there's something weird with the,
uh,

2064
02:03:22.871 --> 02:03:23.704
the morphs,

2065
02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:28.540
the anime morphs giant Dixon big fake titties and having sex with women.

2066
02:03:28.541 --> 02:03:31.330
It's like what,
you know,
having sex with guys that too sometimes.
Yeah.

2067
02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:34.180
But having sex with everybody,
everybody's having sex.

2068
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:36.710
That's just one of those things.
Wow.
That,
wow,

2069
02:03:38.770 --> 02:03:43.010
I've got a date tonight,
so boom,
boom ass to mouth.
Ever.
Justin.

2070
02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:45.710
<v 12>Ah,
AH,</v>

2071
02:03:46.590 --> 02:03:48.450
<v 14>MMM.</v>

2072
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:53.690
<v 0>No.
I have all that information.
The boys got to have secrets.
It's got to be,</v>

2073
02:03:53.730 --> 02:03:57.530
look at it as the green light goes off and red bands corner.
He's a child.

2074
02:03:57.620 --> 02:04:01.550
Trust me.
I know you don't want to take questions on that guy.
Yeah.
Do you mean?

2075
02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:04.400
Do I ever human centipede?
What is the policy?

2076
02:04:04.610 --> 02:04:08.480
Was the policy in the gay community as far as like outing people that are in the

2077
02:04:08.481 --> 02:04:09.050
closet,

2078
02:04:09.050 --> 02:04:13.430
is it considered to be like a Douche move is it's considered to be lots of good

2079
02:04:13.431 --> 02:04:18.330
question.
Like say if you know this guy and uh,

2080
02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:22.250
he's pretending to be straight and maybe he has a few boyfriends,

2081
02:04:22.251 --> 02:04:25.820
but he says a few homophobic things.
Try to throw people off the trail then.

2082
02:04:25.821 --> 02:04:29.660
Is it the green light because it says homophobic things?
Yes.
Dan,

2083
02:04:29.661 --> 02:04:34.460
it's a green light.
I'll say.
Oh,
that's a really good question,
Joe.
That's a,

2084
02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:35.940
that's one of those things where

2085
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:42.450
<v 8>it's like,
uh,
my,
my philosophy is let everybody,</v>

2086
02:04:42.451 --> 02:04:46.200
everybody has their own journey that every wouldn't do what they want to do.

2087
02:04:46.230 --> 02:04:50.520
That's a good philosophy.
It's not my time to say who.
I mean I love you.

2088
02:04:50.521 --> 02:04:52.500
If I'm a friend of yours,
I will love you no matter what.

2089
02:04:52.590 --> 02:04:56.190
That's just the person I am.
That's the person I won't catch eat and babies.

2090
02:04:56.191 --> 02:05:00.990
I'll beat the fuck out of here because I love a good bake and baby love a good

2091
02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.250
bacon.
Maybe
it's everybody's journey is different,
whatever.

2092
02:05:05.370 --> 02:05:07.950
But it's one of those things where it's like if you,
if if,

2093
02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:12.690
if you've got some demons or you've got some issues and you're coming after my,

2094
02:05:12.780 --> 02:05:16.860
my people and then I know some things I'm just going to be like,
all right.

2095
02:05:16.890 --> 02:05:19.470
You know?
Yeah.
That's how I see it's game on.

2096
02:05:19.950 --> 02:05:24.570
That's how I feel about the whole outing thing.
It's sad and the,

2097
02:05:24.670 --> 02:05:27.150
at the end of the day it's just sad.
It's definitely an,

2098
02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:31.500
it's so pitiful to have like tip to hate on a certain group of people.

2099
02:05:31.501 --> 02:05:34.730
And when you're doing this,
when you're part of that,
like it's,

2100
02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:36.120
it's just like what?

2101
02:05:36.210 --> 02:05:39.090
Well they're just self loading and the trash throw people off the trail.

2102
02:05:39.630 --> 02:05:43.980
It's pitiful you ever talked to,
I mean it's so common.

2103
02:05:43.981 --> 02:05:48.000
Like you ever talk to girls that are sluts girl and I want to say anything
wrong.

2104
02:05:48.490 --> 02:05:52.790
I don't want to slut shame but sluts,
love to talk shit about other sluts.
Okay.

2105
02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:55.470
And by the way,
I'm a fan of slots.
I love,
I love,
again,

2106
02:05:55.510 --> 02:06:00.510
I shouldn't say the word slap maybe is retard and training.

2107
02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:03.630
We would all be lumped in together with twink.
Um,

2108
02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:06.510
but there's like girls who will like,

2109
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:10.560
do you know wild sexual shit?

2110
02:06:10.890 --> 02:06:14.020
They'll one of the first to talk shit about other girls doing wild sexual shit,

2111
02:06:14.530 --> 02:06:16.220
whore,
whore.

2112
02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:19.300
And then it's like you look over and there she is like blowing a dude,

2113
02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:21.860
checking the guy off in the bar at the comedy store.
He's like,

2114
02:06:21.861 --> 02:06:24.000
what are you doing a fucking whore.

2115
02:06:24.001 --> 02:06:28.950
I'll stabber she dealt with my guys but at least look,

2116
02:06:29.310 --> 02:06:32.370
that's like less of a secret I guess.
Is that less was it?
Yeah,

2117
02:06:32.371 --> 02:06:33.690
it's less of a secret than being gay.

2118
02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:38.170
They're like when you have a situation like a Ted Haggard,
that guy,
oh,

2119
02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:40.590
the priest who turns out he was hired.

2120
02:06:40.650 --> 02:06:44.730
He was all this pro family anti gay mega church.

2121
02:06:45.390 --> 02:06:48.120
I mean working really hard against gay rights.

2122
02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:52.020
Meanwhile having gay sex prostitutes doing math,

2123
02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:56.880
when that kind of shit gets outed,
I'm all for it.
I'm all for it.
I'm like,

2124
02:06:56.910 --> 02:07:01.050
but that is a,
that is perversion.

2125
02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:04.230
They call gay people perverts.
I'm like,
no.

2126
02:07:04.231 --> 02:07:07.740
What we do is we want to have kids,
we want to have rights,

2127
02:07:08.070 --> 02:07:10.260
we want to drive an SUV.
We want to like,
you know,

2128
02:07:10.261 --> 02:07:15.240
it's like you get to the SUV.
No,
I mean like having a kid.
That's the kid,

2129
02:07:15.241 --> 02:07:18.870
that's the kid car.
It's like the line,
you know queers and trucks,

2130
02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:23.340
no fucking way.
But when you take it to that extreme where it's like bathroom,

2131
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:26.880
meth use and then you're going to preach God's word.

2132
02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:31.500
What that,
I mean it's like,
it's like the,
what's her name?

2133
02:07:31.501 --> 02:07:36.420
The Bachmans those.
Oh no,
that guy's Marcus.
Yeah,
he's a,

2134
02:07:36.421 --> 02:07:40.450
he's just a cute little,
very Baird.
First of all,
he's very heterosexual.

2135
02:07:40.510 --> 02:07:44.350
Maybe the most heterosexual man ever.
Sure.
Yeah.
No Way.
That guy's good.

2136
02:07:44.370 --> 02:07:48.190
I don't get it at all.
There's no way him how's barks?
No wet,

2137
02:07:48.191 --> 02:07:51.460
no Alice Parks by the lot.
I think you're straight.
If you tell me your straight,

2138
02:07:51.461 --> 02:07:54.910
I'll say you're straight.
How's parks?
I love you.
I mean,
hey,

2139
02:07:54.911 --> 02:07:58.630
if he's straight and easy,
settle down.
I didn't say it was not,

2140
02:07:58.631 --> 02:08:02.680
I don't know him personally.
He's totally straight,
but as soon as a great ass,

2141
02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:03.670
but he's not an asshole,

2142
02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:07.000
you know this Ted Haggard guy or any in any of these guys that do it.

2143
02:08:07.001 --> 02:08:12.001
That's gotta be a really like self loathing place to be like a gay person and to

2144
02:08:12.191 --> 02:08:17.191
be like angry and twisted about it and lash out like that one.

2145
02:08:17.470 --> 02:08:19.060
What does it Larry Craig,
who's,
that was his name,

2146
02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:22.030
the congressman was a senator or congressman that got busted doing the thing

2147
02:08:22.031 --> 02:08:26.320
underneath the uh Oh yeah,
the tapping the toes battle.

2148
02:08:26.810 --> 02:08:31.210
That's like that old trick.
The old speakeasy days.
Hey boy,

2149
02:08:31.211 --> 02:08:34.420
you gotta shoot.
I can tap before the Internet.
We had a thing we used to do.

2150
02:08:34.421 --> 02:08:36.520
It's called playing footsie.
I mean that's,

2151
02:08:36.521 --> 02:08:39.550
but I mean that's a hole in the shitter.
A generation.

2152
02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:42.160
I don't know if that's a general like bath houses,
that kind of thing.

2153
02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:44.770
That's like,
Ooh,
well that's still going on,
isn't it?

2154
02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:48.280
Don't you guys get to get all according to bath house weekly,

2155
02:08:48.490 --> 02:08:52.240
but fuck each other with masks on.
Oh,
it has to be fun to pick up guys.

2156
02:08:52.241 --> 02:08:55.390
Like if you want to get laid,
it's probably so much easier.
You know what I mean?

2157
02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:56.740
To just like,
Hey,

2158
02:08:56.741 --> 02:09:00.160
I might go to the bus stop and do my little gay hand wave thing.

2159
02:09:00.161 --> 02:09:04.030
Do I find somebody,
hey,
you leave our gay hand wave alone,
right?

2160
02:09:04.060 --> 02:09:07.090
Eating while you're talking about what you're doing in pig is finish your food

2161
02:09:07.091 --> 02:09:11.170
first.
I can't hang on to that question.
Three hour fucking punk.

2162
02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:13.270
You gotta eat with a mouthful of food

2163
02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:20.380
you muster.
You,
you're like,
I really easy to get laid

2164
02:09:21.940 --> 02:09:25.960
when you suck the cops,
you slobbering.
Dot.
You're like a dry cough.

2165
02:09:26.890 --> 02:09:31.300
Oh God.
Yeah.
It must be way easier to get laid.
I mean,
it's the same.

2166
02:09:31.730 --> 02:09:35.020
It's,
I think it's easy to get laid.
You guys have Tinder for God's sakes.

2167
02:09:35.021 --> 02:09:38.860
I've seen so many of you guys.
Just 10.
We have Tinder.

2168
02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:42.760
Tinder website is what you're saying?
Straight grinder.
So Tinder,
Tinder.

2169
02:09:42.761 --> 02:09:46.080
You could just hook up.
You just say who wants to fuck?
Well,
I think so.
Uh,

2170
02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:48.850
who wants aids and La Jolla.
This weekend there was a,

2171
02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.940
I was with one of my buddies and he was,
he was showing me,

2172
02:09:51.941 --> 02:09:55.870
cause I'd never really seen Tinder,
so he was showing it.
It looks so complicated.

2173
02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:57.650
It's like,
no,

2174
02:09:57.670 --> 02:10:00.850
but it's like you've got to like swipe this way and then you got to do this and

2175
02:10:00.851 --> 02:10:04.210
then you can scroll more.
I'm like with ours,
it's just like,
all right,
come on.

2176
02:10:05.670 --> 02:10:07.090
So with yours,
with Grindr,

2177
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:10.910
say if you're a in a town or do you want a hundred right now,
shall we?
Let's,
no,

2178
02:10:11.070 --> 02:10:15.760
no,
Brian,
put that down if you're in Ohio.
Okay.
And you want to,
uh,

2179
02:10:15.850 --> 02:10:18.610
get your freak on.
Yeah.
So you're,
you're doing a gig in Columbus,

2180
02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:23.950
pull up your app and say,
do you,
do you have a picture of yourself on it?
Yeah.

2181
02:10:24.610 --> 02:10:28.270
Look,
I'll show you ever had a fan.
Yeah,

2182
02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:32.470
that's what I have to kind of,
I think I have to kind of like get,

2183
02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:36.380
I have to wean myself.
Not that I'm like an avid grinder user,
but yeah.

2184
02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:41.340
What's avid?
More than twice a day.
No,
no,
no,
no.
I,

2185
02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:45.650
I rarely,
I rarely,
rarely meet up with once a week,
every night.

2186
02:10:45.651 --> 02:10:49.070
Don't you know how often do you use the grinder?
Let's,

2187
02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:53.000
let's not throw him under the bus though.
Ruined in the guy's falling for this.

2188
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:55.010
This one is,
this is my,
um,

2189
02:10:56.060 --> 02:10:59.060
this is B.
He goes,
uh,

2190
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:04.010
hey there,
what's going on?
And I go,
not a whole lot.
You,
how's your Monday?

2191
02:11:04.290 --> 02:11:07.760
Maybe beat us and want you reading out his shit.
No,
no,
no,
no.
It's,

2192
02:11:07.761 --> 02:11:09.950
I'm not saying no complaints.
Worked early.

2193
02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:14.750
Had the afternoon to myself just making dinner now.
So I'm very sexy and he goes,

2194
02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:18.740
ah,
I'm be nice to meet you.
What did you make?
And I'm like,

2195
02:11:18.741 --> 02:11:21.920
I made a blackened chicken pesto pasta dough.
I think grocer,

2196
02:11:22.050 --> 02:11:23.240
you're the sex coming up.

2197
02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:26.360
I was trying to pick up girls is guys try and pick up God's,

2198
02:11:26.361 --> 02:11:30.260
you're about to make me fucking grow up just with the mundane.

2199
02:11:30.261 --> 02:11:33.770
This of your fucking interaction.
I was hoping it was way more fun.
No,

2200
02:11:33.771 --> 02:11:37.250
I got to know who wants this.
Dick is a picture of some Dick.
What I'm saying?

2201
02:11:37.330 --> 02:11:42.020
Got It.
I'm on the corner.
No,
no,
no.
The guy drives by with his pants off.

2202
02:11:42.110 --> 02:11:45.170
That's how you think it would be.
That's how we talked.
I talked to girls.
No,

2203
02:11:45.171 --> 02:11:48.590
see I'm a lesbian.
That's what I wanted to say.
I'm just a big old lesbian.
Yeah,

2204
02:11:48.591 --> 02:11:51.620
you're about making dinner and shit.
You got Pesto.
I don't care.

2205
02:11:51.650 --> 02:11:55.820
I mean Irish garlics which is seen now.
You know,
it's like it's,
I don't know.

2206
02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:57.290
Maybe it's just such a scene.

2207
02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:00.290
It's such a scene now about the whole like just hooking up and you know,

2208
02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:02.630
maybe I want a little more.
We all know this.

2209
02:12:02.631 --> 02:12:05.000
We don't know we're on the war when the outside,

2210
02:12:05.001 --> 02:12:08.930
we only talk to you guys like very briefly about your sex life.
Then we run away.

2211
02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:13.820
I'm the Unicorn in the room.
Went away,
we clean our hands.
Just run your,

2212
02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:17.990
run your body through a car wash.
He keeps it pure.
L and I spray it in my mouth.

2213
02:12:18.290 --> 02:12:20.960
Just the case of me.
Hey,
can we do the same with you guys?

2214
02:12:20.961 --> 02:12:23.870
So don't worry about it.
It'll flow to here and then on my tongue.

2215
02:12:23.871 --> 02:12:25.370
And I might catch the gay.

2216
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:29.900
I'm actually leaving here and taking a nice hot shower.
You should get a scrub.

2217
02:12:30.110 --> 02:12:32.930
We go to a car wash.
Just a nicest steel wool pad.

2218
02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:37.550
That's what I'm just going to [inaudible] I love,

2219
02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:41.750
I love straight people lovers.
Have you ever sneezed and poop came out?

2220
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:45.990
Uh,
you dumb.

2221
02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:49.340
Fuck he told you he's a top.
Yeah.
Oh No,
I'm your mouth.

2222
02:12:50.090 --> 02:12:54.920
Oh God.
Why did you have to get gross?
Because he's a child.

2223
02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:57.350
I know and yes,
I have no,

2224
02:12:57.351 --> 02:13:00.830
I'm not what you're about to say for an extra five seconds.

2225
02:13:01.260 --> 02:13:05.740
Just thinking about it for an extra five seconds.
I get it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2226
02:13:07.150 --> 02:13:11.090
What did you just think sex is just sex is just,
I think it's gross.
Either way.

2227
02:13:11.091 --> 02:13:15.270
You know,
fluids and sex is gross.
Poop come

2228
02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:19.940
well,
but you do it though still.
Yeah.
We were handled to do what you gotta do

2229
02:13:21.500 --> 02:13:25.200
when you don't need it,
when you need it.
Exactly what the doctor ordered.
Yeah,

2230
02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:29.090
that's true.
Did you like push you when you had it?
Um,

2231
02:13:30.930 --> 02:13:34.330
no.
Sorry.
It felt,
it feels bad to,
you know,
it didn't feel bad.

2232
02:13:34.331 --> 02:13:38.610
It wasn't like I'm shoving my Dick in between a sandpaper Arby's sandwich,

2233
02:13:38.700 --> 02:13:42.930
but like it was,
it was so gross.
Um,
no,
it was nice,

2234
02:13:42.931 --> 02:13:45.980
but it was just like I did it.
It was,
we just weren't attracted to girls.
Yeah.

2235
02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:50.820
Or you love.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was one of those things like,
oh,

2236
02:13:50.821 --> 02:13:55.080
I'm just going to be friends with them.
So we did have sex with them.

2237
02:13:55.081 --> 02:13:59.670
So you did get aroused by girls.
It's just not as satisfying.
Right,
right.

2238
02:13:59.700 --> 02:14:04.560
And you feel more drawn to men.
And did you,
when you went,
when you went by,

2239
02:14:04.561 --> 02:14:07.320
you said you went by for a while.
Yeah.
But what do you think that was?

2240
02:14:07.321 --> 02:14:12.110
Was that like you trying to figure out like who you were?
Try to,

2241
02:14:12.450 --> 02:14:15.810
let's try it.
A lot of people do that.
This is an eight.
Oh,
this one's a,

2242
02:14:15.850 --> 02:14:20.400
this one's a five.
Yeah.
Maybe she just doesn't like me if I had another one.
Yeah.

2243
02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:24.060
Yeah.
So,
yeah,
exactly.
There was,
there was a period,
I mean there was a,

2244
02:14:24.330 --> 02:14:27.420
there was a time when it was,
I want to say it was like my mind,

2245
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:33.810
I was like 23 I guess.
And um,
uh,

2246
02:14:34.230 --> 02:14:39.090
there was this girl and um,
can we get even saying this story?

2247
02:14:39.091 --> 02:14:41.370
She like,
we had this thing,

2248
02:14:41.371 --> 02:14:45.120
like it was this kind of like a fair,
if you will,

2249
02:14:45.121 --> 02:14:49.290
like she was engaged and yeah.
And so like it was hot and heavy.

2250
02:14:50.070 --> 02:14:53.070
It was fun.
But it was a girl.
It was,
yeah,

2251
02:14:53.170 --> 02:14:56.320
we had a good time and it was one of those things where,
you know,

2252
02:14:56.370 --> 02:14:58.660
she would tell me,
she's like,
you know,
you're not gay this you can,
you know,

2253
02:14:58.740 --> 02:15:01.980
you're doing this too well then you're,
you're,
you're playing with my heart.

2254
02:15:01.981 --> 02:15:04.590
And so it was kind of like dangerous at the same time.

2255
02:15:04.591 --> 02:15:07.410
And then her fiance found out,
oh Jesus,

2256
02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:12.560
her fiance actually found out when I was going down on her and her bedroom,

2257
02:15:13.010 --> 02:15:17.400
he walked in.
No,
he was knocking on the door outside and the lights were on.

2258
02:15:17.401 --> 02:15:20.220
We were like,
Oh shit.
And he was like,
Hey,
I'm here.
I'm here,
I'm here,
I'm here,

2259
02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:24.060
open the door with the door and immediately what do I do?
Cause there's,
I'm like,

2260
02:15:24.061 --> 02:15:28.190
what do I do?
What do I,
what do I do?
I jump in the shower like an asshole.

2261
02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:31.860
No,
because that's not suspicious.
Oh,

2262
02:15:31.861 --> 02:15:35.390
I just came over to shower her fiance's house.

2263
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:38.100
You turn the shower on the shower on and he's like,
what are you doing?
I'm like,

2264
02:15:38.101 --> 02:15:40.020
Oh yeah,
I'll see you later.
If it was great.
Uh,

2265
02:15:40.050 --> 02:15:43.290
thanks for the study break and the shower,

2266
02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:50.100
what I got,
I had to get pussy off my face.
Right?
Yeah,
I really did.

2267
02:15:50.130 --> 02:15:54.660
That's the thing with a steel wall pad,
you know,
and um,
God so and so,

2268
02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:59.940
and then,
and then she moved away and then,
um,

2269
02:16:00.630 --> 02:16:05.460
I got this phone call.
Oh God,
it was so crazy.
Um,

2270
02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:08.390
I got this phone call from him to the fiance.

2271
02:16:08.420 --> 02:16:12.470
What'd you jerking off over the phone?
No,
he was mad.
He was like,
oh dude.

2272
02:16:12.471 --> 02:16:15.860
He was like,
so what the fuck is my hearing about this and this and this.

2273
02:16:16.670 --> 02:16:20.410
And she's in the background and she's just like,
he's lying.
He's lying.
He's a,

2274
02:16:20.411 --> 02:16:24.020
he's a fucking faggot.
Don't listen to them about a year.
Oh yeah.

2275
02:16:24.021 --> 02:16:24.980
She threw you down.

2276
02:16:25.010 --> 02:16:30.010
Threw me down under the bus and that was the time and this was somebody that I

2277
02:16:31.241 --> 02:16:32.890
was like,
I,
we had like,

2278
02:16:32.891 --> 02:16:37.891
I thought we had something and when she said that I was like later,

2279
02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:40.980
like I couldn't like that was it.
So you,
how we'll,
do you have the time?

2280
02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:45.250
I was 22 or 23 and you'd already come out.

2281
02:16:45.370 --> 02:16:49.930
You'd come out when you were,
when you were there,
you told her that you were gay.

2282
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:53.620
Yeah.
Like everyone,
like knew,
like it was just one of those.

2283
02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:56.470
But then you get those girls who were like,
I'm going to turn you.

2284
02:16:56.471 --> 02:16:58.740
And you're like,
oh,
I get it all the time.

2285
02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:02.950
You get it all the time trying to turn you straight.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
But this one,

2286
02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:06.700
it works for a little bit,
sort of.
I get asked it a lot.
I was,

2287
02:17:06.701 --> 02:17:10.690
I don't know if it was you,
it was probably,
oh,
the other night at the store.

2288
02:17:10.691 --> 02:17:11.770
Maybe like a week or two ago.
You're like,

2289
02:17:11.771 --> 02:17:14.860
would you ever like if a hot girl came up to you,
I'm like,
hmm,

2290
02:17:14.890 --> 02:17:15.850
that's a good question.

2291
02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:19.630
Imagine having sex and then just having a guy sit there with the balls on your

2292
02:17:19.631 --> 02:17:22.980
forehead.
You could probably love it.
You have your fantasy Brian.

2293
02:17:23.530 --> 02:17:27.820
And they'll have by meaning he would only see guy and balls and he would feel

2294
02:17:27.821 --> 02:17:30.610
pussy.
What are you talking about?
Balls.
What do you mean?

2295
02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:34.480
Like if a woman is on top of him fucking him and then a guy just like,

2296
02:17:35.070 --> 02:17:36.420
that's a threeway.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2297
02:17:36.490 --> 02:17:39.660
But you're only seeing the dick and balls that probably be the most ideal thing

2298
02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:44.410
to shut up.
Oh my God.
Just five minutes.

2299
02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:49.210
Think about what we're going to say for fun.
Yeah.
So,
um,
I dunno,
I would,

2300
02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:51.940
I would think,
I dunno.
I Dunno if I could or not.

2301
02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:55.210
<v 2>I don't,
but there's no,
there's no social stigma attached to that.</v>

2302
02:17:55.211 --> 02:17:58.540
If you chose to have sex with a woman,
it's like,
it's no big deal.

2303
02:17:58.690 --> 02:18:02.290
Whereas if a guy is a straight guy and then he just chooses to have sex with a

2304
02:18:02.291 --> 02:18:05.950
guy like that's in this culture,
that's fucking crazy.

2305
02:18:05.951 --> 02:18:08.650
That's really unusual.
But in some cultures

2306
02:18:08.690 --> 02:18:10.910
<v 8>it's like,
I don't think,
I don't think a straight guy.
I don't,
well,</v>

2307
02:18:10.911 --> 02:18:14.120
I don't think a guy could be bisexual,
but a girl could be bisexual,

2308
02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:15.110
but isn't that

2309
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:18.710
<v 2>well,
is it m?
I think definitely guys can be bisexual.
I don't think so.</v>

2310
02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:22.550
You don't think so?
I've said that there's two types of dudes who do gay things.

2311
02:18:22.580 --> 02:18:24.680
There's gay dudes and there's really gullible,

2312
02:18:24.681 --> 02:18:27.950
straight dudes who get talked in the blowing crafty gay dudes.

2313
02:18:28.860 --> 02:18:31.430
I think that's what it is.
There's a lot,
especially in

2314
02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:35.740
<v 8>for an industry,
there's a lot of like,
you know,
well,
we were all straight.</v>

2315
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:37.063
Yeah.

2316
02:18:37.170 --> 02:18:41.130
<v 2>But gay for pay is a different thing.
Like gears,
um,
a lot of,
uh,</v>

2317
02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:46.010
gay people will find straight guys that are really broke.
Like there's this,
uh,

2318
02:18:46.020 --> 02:18:50.280
this guy who's friends with my wife,
who's a gay guy.
Who's this?
Mack,

2319
02:18:50.330 --> 02:18:54.420
Daddy's got a lot of cash.
[inaudible] gets a lot boys,
you know I,
it is,

2320
02:18:54.750 --> 02:18:57.540
and he gets dudes that are straight and he had this Russian dude,

2321
02:18:57.600 --> 02:19:00.300
is it a website?
He runs,
she's got a car.

2322
02:19:00.330 --> 02:19:03.340
I got put the guy up and apartment like he was going broke because he was

2323
02:19:03.350 --> 02:19:06.150
spending all of his money to take care of is this a straight guy?

2324
02:19:06.151 --> 02:19:10.580
And this straight guy would suck his dick.
Yeah,
you'd get together with this.

2325
02:19:10.930 --> 02:19:15.630
The guy was like heavy Russian accent,
kind of tough luck in and like,
uh,

2326
02:19:16.020 --> 02:19:17.940
what's his name from,
nevermind.

2327
02:19:18.310 --> 02:19:21.930
He was like a gay Jason stayed them looking kind of a but with a Russian accent

2328
02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:25.410
and apparently this guy was just a,
no one's looking okay.

2329
02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:29.200
<v 8>Oh,
just cheese everywhere.</v>

2330
02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:32.780
Made sure that he took care of this guy,
give us kind of apartment,

2331
02:19:32.781 --> 02:19:36.050
gave him money,
give him the guy wanted too much.
At a certain point in time,

2332
02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:42.230
he actually,
uh,
lost a big chunk of his money,
try to keep this guy.

2333
02:19:42.231 --> 02:19:46.710
But this guy was like the latest in a series of straight guys that he had a

2334
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.920
manipulated into.
There's a lot of personal position.
That's a thing,
isn't it?

2335
02:19:50.930 --> 02:19:55.040
That's the thing.
Yeah.
It's like finding straight guys.
Yeah.

2336
02:19:55.041 --> 02:19:58.820
I had a buddy of mine who was in,
um,
uh,
a wardrobe guy and he was gay.

2337
02:19:58.821 --> 02:20:00.050
He would always tell us about,
uh,

2338
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:04.760
all the different quote unquote trait guys that let him suck their Dick.
Jesus.

2339
02:20:06.900 --> 02:20:09.770
He would get a kick out of it and they're really funny.
I get,

2340
02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:11.510
I get a lot of them too,
so,

2341
02:20:13.500 --> 02:20:17.870
but they're not straight guys then.
They just know they are,
they are.
Well,

2342
02:20:17.871 --> 02:20:20.120
how are these,
no.
Okay.
You were going to say they're confused.

2343
02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:23.780
They're just confused.
Do you think that you're,

2344
02:20:23.781 --> 02:20:27.530
it's extra likely to happen to you if you kill on stage?
Ah,
yeah.

2345
02:20:27.531 --> 02:20:31.430
It's happened before and more likely what it has happened,

2346
02:20:31.431 --> 02:20:33.130
but I mean more likely because you're,

2347
02:20:33.131 --> 02:20:35.840
you're on stage and you can feel and you become attractive.
Yeah.

2348
02:20:35.930 --> 02:20:39.320
There's that like,
yeah.
They're like,
oh,
he's hot and broken.

2349
02:20:40.770 --> 02:20:44.450
And so the straight guys find that attractive.
I had,

2350
02:20:44.451 --> 02:20:47.120
I'm actually ahead a guests.
They do.

2351
02:20:47.140 --> 02:20:51.560
Those guys are not straight Justin Martin Gayle,
there is no Santa Claus.

2352
02:20:51.561 --> 02:20:55.520
The Easter bunny is not real.
And that was a gay dudes now.
But they're like,

2353
02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:59.810
oh this my girlfriend.
It's like,
oh,

2354
02:20:59.811 --> 02:21:01.220
how the tables have turned.

2355
02:21:01.810 --> 02:21:06.810
Well how many dudes who put on this sort of like straight act just for society,

2356
02:21:08.541 --> 02:21:12.830
for jobs,
for career,
for whatever.
Fill in the blank.

2357
02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:16.610
How like a percentage.
It's a lot,
right?
I mean who knows?

2358
02:21:16.611 --> 02:21:20.440
Percentage wise that would be speculative,
but it's one of them.
And yeah,

2359
02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:22.250
I want to say like for instance,

2360
02:21:22.251 --> 02:21:27.050
I was in San Diego this past weekend and it was like,
I,
I um,
I was like,

2361
02:21:27.051 --> 02:21:30.060
where all the,
where are the black people?
Where are the white people who,

2362
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:33.320
it's like,
where's the Mexicans?
Ooh,
where's the gay people?

2363
02:21:35.060 --> 02:21:38.720
I was like,
really guys?
Really?
No Gay people in San Diego?

2364
02:21:38.721 --> 02:21:41.770
Is that what it was just one of those like too scared?
Yeah.
Oh,

2365
02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:44.120
they didn't want to you I want to say anything.
And then like,

2366
02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:47.360
and then ambulance consultant afterwards.
Yeah,
it's very,
very conservative.

2367
02:21:47.361 --> 02:21:50.960
Whatever.
Um,
but then after the show had like,
like a couple of guys were like,

2368
02:21:50.961 --> 02:21:54.190
Hey,
uh,
yeah,
so I'm in the,
you were talking about the military early real.

2369
02:21:54.191 --> 02:21:56.060
I'm in the,
I'm in the military.
What are you doing later?

2370
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:58.940
You want to go grab a drink or something?
I was like,

2371
02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:02.420
quit trying to fuck sir.
Whoa.

2372
02:22:02.421 --> 02:22:04.970
That's what they do to try to get you and have a drink afterwards.
Oh yeah.

2373
02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.010
Maybe some dude's spend a lot of time on a big navy ship,

2374
02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:10.490
which is very terrifying cause I'm like,
I just feel like I would,

2375
02:22:10.820 --> 02:22:13.370
I would be like a little piece of veal.

2376
02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:17.210
Just throw them and maybe have thrown to the wolves heal you after it's over.

2377
02:22:17.211 --> 02:22:19.850
So he keeps God damn secret.
Exactly.
Exactly.

2378
02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:24.470
My military career just to Martindale.
Never know.
I'm like,
that's,
I refuse.

2379
02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:29.130
That's not like this.
No,
I'm like this,
I want to go on a big mega volcano.

2380
02:22:29.430 --> 02:22:33.990
I think that,
uh,
there's obviously a tremendous amount of discrimination,

2381
02:22:33.991 --> 02:22:37.170
racism,
homophobia.
There's still,
it's still a tremendous amount of it,

2382
02:22:37.171 --> 02:22:39.990
but I think it's getting better.
I really do to culturally,

2383
02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:44.400
I think we're at a really good time.
Yeah.
I think those are seeing change.
It's,

2384
02:22:44.420 --> 02:22:47.820
it's good.
Cause I mean,
God,
for a while there was just so boring.

2385
02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:50.910
Why wouldn't you want to make the world a little more colorful?

2386
02:22:50.911 --> 02:22:55.460
And people are scared?
It's sad too.
And I've been,
I've been scared.
I go to,

2387
02:22:56.120 --> 02:22:58.760
I go to the Midwest and I'm terrified.
You know,

2388
02:22:58.761 --> 02:23:03.230
there's like parts of the country that I'm just like,
oh my God.
Like,
well,

2389
02:23:03.240 --> 02:23:06.500
even like I remember,
I know when I got,
well I went back to,

2390
02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:10.490
to Texas not too long ago.
Um,

2391
02:23:11.810 --> 02:23:15.290
but I mean I dressed,
I mean I feel like I dress okay.
I don't can open up.

2392
02:23:15.950 --> 02:23:20.390
Sometimes my shirts may be a little snug sometimes or you know,

2393
02:23:20.391 --> 02:23:24.620
my genes may be a little tight.
You know how the fashion style is out here.

2394
02:23:25.070 --> 02:23:27.350
And I'll wear that out in a small town and I just see the,

2395
02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:31.540
the looks just like what?
Lean even more in flannel.
Yeah.

2396
02:23:31.690 --> 02:23:35.850
There's a Sasquatch over there.
I ain't got no camera.
Yeah.

2397
02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:41.470
Oh,
his hair.
His hair's too pretty there.
He's all clean sheet here.
I'm like,

2398
02:23:41.500 --> 02:23:44.560
you gave,
you touch it.
It's a lot of crazy shit,

2399
02:23:45.230 --> 02:23:49.330
but gay gang.
She didn't know you were gay the first year.
I knew you.

2400
02:23:49.570 --> 02:23:53.180
I like my Gaydar never went off or I never really had a lot of shit to the shop

2401
02:23:55.720 --> 02:23:59.500
shop song.
Maybe it was just lost in your eyes.
Yup.
Hypnotic.

2402
02:23:59.501 --> 02:24:03.910
We're just lost in La.
You'll,
you were coming from Ohio Mac time machines.

2403
02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:07.690
They don't come up this far of Santa Monica Boulevard.

2404
02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:11.630
I kidnap Brian from the 1950s and brought them into the future.
He did.

2405
02:24:11.690 --> 02:24:14.920
Mother fucker was in a storm cellar and gateway computers.

2406
02:24:15.850 --> 02:24:20.200
He got robbed by a black wizard the following week after I did.
That's right.

2407
02:24:20.230 --> 02:24:23.410
We talked about that right by my house at the time.

2408
02:24:24.410 --> 02:24:26.080
He was walking back from the,
I know several people.

2409
02:24:26.081 --> 02:24:30.760
We were all together at gunpoint in Hollywood.
It's not pleasant.

2410
02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:35.020
It's not pleasant at all.
It is one of the,
and it's one of those,
God.
It was so,

2411
02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:39.050
did you have post traumatic?
I did,
yeah.
I still have a little of it.

2412
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:44.240
I do too.
I did too.
I think it's,
it's,
it's not as bad as it was,

2413
02:24:44.241 --> 02:24:47.900
but it's one of those things where like if somebody is behind me or if like

2414
02:24:47.901 --> 02:24:51.170
somebody pops out,
like I'll,
I mean I like jerk and like,

2415
02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:53.510
or come down to the blue like really bad.

2416
02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:55.790
Like I'll be parking at night and I'd be like,
oh my God,

2417
02:24:55.791 --> 02:24:57.990
I don't want get in my car right now.
Like out of nowhere,
I'm just,

2418
02:24:58.220 --> 02:25:00.950
there was a part,
there was a time where I did not leave my house.

2419
02:25:00.980 --> 02:25:05.570
Like I canceled spots,
like I couldn't do from violent crimes.

2420
02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:08.560
Posttraumatic stress is big.
Well,
and it wasn't necessarily,

2421
02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:13.040
it wasn't violent at all.
It was just a like,
listen,
give me your phone.
Yeah,

2422
02:25:13.270 --> 02:25:15.890
it's the threat of violence.

2423
02:25:15.980 --> 02:25:19.430
But I'm saying it wasn't physical and that's the thing that was scary because

2424
02:25:19.431 --> 02:25:22.010
like he made me like walk like it was,

2425
02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:25.840
I was in such that he robbed me and then started walking down the street that I

2426
02:25:25.841 --> 02:25:30.340
needed to walk down.
So I'm following him and he turns around and he's like,

2427
02:25:30.341 --> 02:25:34.390
what are you doing?
And I'm like,
I'm going home.

2428
02:25:34.940 --> 02:25:37.210
Like I live right down the street.
He's like,

2429
02:25:37.211 --> 02:25:39.430
you ain't going to live down the street if you,
if you keep following me.

2430
02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:43.310
And I was like,
Oh God.
And so I,
I honestly,
I did the,
the Justin just the

2431
02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:49.350
all the eyes roll the eyes,
like God dammit,

2432
02:25:49.380 --> 02:25:52.020
it took me so long to get here.
And then I,
um,

2433
02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:55.510
some walking around the block and as I'm walking around the block,
he had

2434
02:25:57.010 --> 02:26:02.010
gone down the alleyway and got into this white van and the white van drove off.

2435
02:26:02.650 --> 02:26:06.010
And that's the thing that scared me the most was just the fact that I was

2436
02:26:06.011 --> 02:26:09.400
probably being watched.
Like it was,
he was the guy,

2437
02:26:09.550 --> 02:26:12.210
there's like three other guys probably out here.
Like what?

2438
02:26:12.250 --> 02:26:17.250
Like if I fought or if I tried to make an attempt to not give him my stuff.

2439
02:26:19.751 --> 02:26:23.510
Like they,
that's the scary thing to me that they would have probably.
Yeah.

2440
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:25.660
And um,
same thing happened to me.

2441
02:26:25.661 --> 02:26:28.600
There was another guy in a van across the street.

2442
02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:31.990
Do you usually use other people?
They'll spot,
you know,
unless they're,

2443
02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:35.480
I mean there's obviously people that do it single and Desperado,
but you know,

2444
02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:38.830
if you're gonna rob a bunch of people getting a car and drive somewhere,

2445
02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:42.100
you look out and no one's coming.
Get this guy.
They got him though.
They,

2446
02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:46.270
I think they got him.
I had to go,
I had to file a police report and all that.

2447
02:26:46.271 --> 02:26:50.740
And because you have to go look at a lineup.
Really.
Did you share it with him?

2448
02:26:50.980 --> 02:26:54.250
No,
but I,
I honestly told them that I was like,
I can't,
I was like,

2449
02:26:54.251 --> 02:26:55.450
it was three o'clock in the morning.

2450
02:26:55.451 --> 02:26:58.480
It was so dark and I don't want to be that guy who likes that guy.

2451
02:26:58.481 --> 02:27:01.590
And it wasn't him.
I was like,
honestly,
I can't remember.
And it was,

2452
02:27:01.591 --> 02:27:04.300
it was such a long time after it had happened too,

2453
02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:08.150
so it wasn't like they got him,
Oh God.

2454
02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:13.170
I want to say it was like six or seven months after us because apparently it was

2455
02:27:15.311 --> 02:27:18.010
a,
it was a string of them in Hollywood.
Like it was happening a lot.

2456
02:27:18.011 --> 02:27:21.580
There was the guy who was like throwing the bombs in people's garages.

2457
02:27:21.581 --> 02:27:22.131
Remember that guy?

2458
02:27:22.131 --> 02:27:25.840
It was like right around that time there was like this crazy crime ring because

2459
02:27:25.841 --> 02:27:30.160
all the people from La and Hollywood are like slowly coming into to West

2460
02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:30.821
Hollywood and people are like,
oh,

2461
02:27:30.821 --> 02:27:34.600
what's Hollywood so safe and it's clean and nice.
I'm like,
no,
there's,

2462
02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:37.270
if you drive down Santa Monica Boulevard now,
it's like there's,

2463
02:27:37.330 --> 02:27:40.510
there's crazy people.
Like it's just,
it's out of control.

2464
02:27:40.511 --> 02:27:41.470
Everyone's losing their minds.

2465
02:27:41.471 --> 02:27:44.680
Do you think people are targeting people because it's so safe for the people

2466
02:27:44.681 --> 02:27:47.200
think it's so safe?
Yeah,
I think it's,
you know,

2467
02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:51.640
I mean people are stealing people's dogs.
Like that's just messed up.
Yes.

2468
02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:53.740
In West Hollywood,
you leave your dog in the car.

2469
02:27:53.741 --> 02:27:55.990
Like someone will come in and take your dog,

2470
02:27:55.991 --> 02:27:58.150
looks like I'm just going to roll the window down and have the dog,
you know,

2471
02:27:58.450 --> 02:28:00.700
get some air while I'm running into cvs or something.

2472
02:28:00.730 --> 02:28:03.450
Someone just comes in and checks the dog walks away.
So I was like,

2473
02:28:03.580 --> 02:28:05.780
there's so many shitty people out there in this world.
Yeah.

2474
02:28:06.010 --> 02:28:07.420
There's a lot of great people out there in this one.

2475
02:28:07.421 --> 02:28:09.010
But God damn to some fucking shit heads,

2476
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:15.040
someone stealing someone's dog is so great.
I'm like,
well,
who does that?

2477
02:28:15.130 --> 02:28:19.180
That's a real piece of shit.
Yeah.
I have to be a real piece of shit to do that.

2478
02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:23.480
Good.
I can do with that as holes

2479
02:28:23.570 --> 02:28:28.090
<v 2>everywhere you look.
I'm hoping that that's the,
the,</v>

2480
02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:30.320
the next thing that changes about human beings.

2481
02:28:30.321 --> 02:28:34.680
We slowly but surely start to weed out the assholes in our culture among the

2482
02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:38.270
hoping that that's going to be the next evolution of society.
I'm hoping,

2483
02:28:38.780 --> 02:28:40.670
and your in your,
in your head,
that's the,

2484
02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:43.640
it's gotta be some of the thing that's gonna save us.

2485
02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:48.880
We have to realize that these ideas that we have like fighting over various

2486
02:28:50.361 --> 02:28:54.560
ideologies,
politics,
uh,
the way,
you know,

2487
02:28:54.561 --> 02:28:56.870
conservative versus liberal,
white versus black,

2488
02:28:57.320 --> 02:28:58.970
all that stuff is so fucking stupid.

2489
02:28:58.971 --> 02:29:01.670
I think that one day we're going to realize that our only problem in this life

2490
02:29:01.671 --> 02:29:03.980
as people who are assholes,
it's our only problem.

2491
02:29:04.610 --> 02:29:09.050
Whether it's war or theft or crime or cyber crime or corruption.

2492
02:29:09.500 --> 02:29:11.660
It's all the same problem.
It's people that are assholes,

2493
02:29:11.661 --> 02:29:15.590
whether it's rape or murder or whatever.
It is,
assholes.

2494
02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:17.270
It's just shitty human being.

2495
02:29:17.350 --> 02:29:20.630
<v 8>I just slowly developed humans.
That's exactly,
I think that's exactly what it is.</v>

2496
02:29:20.631 --> 02:29:23.890
Poorly developed Cubans.
It's a,
it's a mutation if you will.

2497
02:29:23.930 --> 02:29:26.720
<v 2>Well,
we need really strict,
not strict,</v>

2498
02:29:26.721 --> 02:29:30.020
but we need strong philosophies like the tall whites.

2499
02:29:30.170 --> 02:29:31.690
Do you know what the tall whites are?
No,

2500
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:37.610
the tall whites are apparently a group of,
um,
aliens

2501
02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:40.550
<v 8>that are in area 50s area 51 now.</v>

2502
02:29:40.940 --> 02:29:44.930
And they're walking amongst us and they are advanced.

2503
02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:48.170
And it's like a thing that,
do you see the Russian guys a thing?

2504
02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:52.440
It's like a thing.
The tall whites that check out the video of the Russian guy.

2505
02:29:52.480 --> 02:29:56.930
No,
no,
no,
no.
Oh,
Canadian.
There's a Canadian guy.
He's in Congress and he's like,

2506
02:29:56.931 --> 02:30:00.500
we all know about these aliens.
The guy's an idiot.
I've seen,
I don't know.

2507
02:30:00.860 --> 02:30:02.990
I saw people walking out of the ocean.
I saw,

2508
02:30:03.020 --> 02:30:06.610
well you didn't see anybody walking out the secondary shit.
Scuba diver.
No,

2509
02:30:06.620 --> 02:30:09.930
it was late.
The man with three piece suit.
Puma.

2510
02:30:10.350 --> 02:30:14.360
So who's thinking about killing?
I'm sorry guys.
This is a hate crime now,
right?

2511
02:30:14.361 --> 02:30:17.270
Calm down.
You saw an asshole.
Those thinking about killing himself.

2512
02:30:18.290 --> 02:30:20.750
Get home to his family and he walked out of the water and you're like,

2513
02:30:21.870 --> 02:30:26.630
oh mg and you ran away fucking tweeting it.
Did I say Omg,
Joe,

2514
02:30:27.240 --> 02:30:31.610
you do.
I look like I say,
Omg out loud is sparkles.
Came off your hill.

2515
02:30:31.660 --> 02:30:36.290
He ran uphill.
Okay,
that part's true.
All right.
That was true

2516
02:30:37.850 --> 02:30:39.920
with a nice little rainbow stream behind me.

2517
02:30:39.950 --> 02:30:42.740
He panicked and farting glitter before you ran into your house.
Hey,

2518
02:30:42.741 --> 02:30:46.220
don't be jealous that I parked glitter.
All right.
It's a magical thing.

2519
02:30:46.250 --> 02:30:49.730
What are these aliens you believe in?
They're called the tall whites.
They're not.

2520
02:30:49.910 --> 02:30:53.540
Listen,
all these people that tell you they're,
see aliens are all idiots.

2521
02:30:53.570 --> 02:30:54.780
That's the universal,

2522
02:30:54.840 --> 02:30:57.180
<v 2>that's the one thing that's universal about these people.</v>

2523
02:30:57.181 --> 02:30:58.440
They're almost all idiots.

2524
02:30:58.680 --> 02:31:02.880
I talked to the guy was a former senator on my TV show on the Scifi show.

2525
02:31:03.210 --> 02:31:06.810
It was telling me all about area 51 all the evidence and area 51 he's a fucking

2526
02:31:06.811 --> 02:31:10.080
former senator and I talked to him for 10 minutes and I just,

2527
02:31:10.140 --> 02:31:13.500
I knew exactly what was going on.
I'm like,
you,
you're just a silly man.

2528
02:31:13.530 --> 02:31:15.900
You're a silly man that happened to be a former senator.

2529
02:31:15.901 --> 02:31:18.720
You're a guy who a believer and you believe in and things with

2530
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:21.720
<v 8>zero evidence.
I mean,</v>

2531
02:31:21.721 --> 02:31:26.580
there's almost no evidence except these weird photographs.

2532
02:31:26.610 --> 02:31:28.030
Oh,
here it is.
Yeah.
Listen to play this.

2533
02:31:28.600 --> 02:31:30.690
I will end with this because we've got to get out.
Okay.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2534
02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:35.100
Let's end with this.
You're welcome guys.
Yeah.
Powerful.
Justin Martindale.

2535
02:31:37.110 --> 02:31:41.040
It doesn't exist.
Well they,
they,
they probably took it down.

2536
02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:43.110
Just look up Canadian prime minister,

2537
02:31:43.111 --> 02:31:46.170
whatever the fuck is the Canadian prime minister saying that aliens.

2538
02:31:46.620 --> 02:31:49.260
<v 2>What was his official title?
Wasn't prime minister,
right?</v>

2539
02:31:49.530 --> 02:31:53.100
I think it was a minister of defense or something like that.

2540
02:31:53.730 --> 02:31:57.840
Canadian.
We've got to find it.
Go back to the advice thing.
What is his name?

2541
02:31:58.990 --> 02:32:00.280
<v 11>Hold on.
Uh,</v>

2542
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:05.590
<v 2>what does the Guy Do?
Oh my God.
Brian.</v>

2543
02:32:06.290 --> 02:32:11.120
<v 8>This computer is like really shitty Canadian Prime Minister Aliens.</v>

2544
02:32:12.550 --> 02:32:17.290
<v 2>Is it the computer shitting?
Okay.
Uh,
Canadians,
former defense minister.
Yeah,</v>

2545
02:32:17.380 --> 02:32:19.360
that's it.
Former defense minister.
Okay,

2546
02:32:19.361 --> 02:32:22.930
so just Google that Canadian former defense minister.
I'll bring in a,

2547
02:32:22.931 --> 02:32:25.600
I have my other laptop.
I'll bring that in from now on.
Yeah.
This one

2548
02:32:26.830 --> 02:32:31.460
<v 8>catch up.
One of the species is called the tall white.
See?
Oh my God,
it's so real.</v>

2549
02:32:31.461 --> 02:32:32.294
It's printed

2550
02:32:34.940 --> 02:32:37.790
there alive ets on earth at this present time.

2551
02:32:37.820 --> 02:32:42.820
O M g cabal formed by the Council of Foreign Relations,

2552
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.550
the bill,
the burgers and the trilateral commission,

2553
02:32:46.551 --> 02:32:48.570
the international banking cards.
Right.

2554
02:32:48.620 --> 02:32:53.000
<v 2>The oil cartel and the select members of the military are planning to create one</v>

2555
02:32:53.001 --> 02:32:53.834
world government.

2556
02:32:54.350 --> 02:32:58.040
They are the ones suppressing the information about the aliens to the public

2557
02:32:58.550 --> 02:32:59.383
bitch.

2558
02:32:59.470 --> 02:33:02.620
<v 8>He looked like he didn't believe in aliens.
It doesn't he,
he's a dumb ass</v>

2559
02:33:04.210 --> 02:33:07.030
by reasoning and by,
this is an hour and 20 minutes long.

2560
02:33:07.031 --> 02:33:09.400
So this isn't the one though,
but this is probably a different one.

2561
02:33:09.450 --> 02:33:13.500
<v 2>I think it's a different guy.
Charles Hall.
Yeah.</v>

2562
02:33:13.530 --> 02:33:16.470
I don't want to fucking silly.
Fuck.
So I don't know.

2563
02:33:16.800 --> 02:33:18.900
That's the thing that I got out of these,
um,

2564
02:33:19.230 --> 02:33:21.600
these interviews with all these people.
It's not that,

2565
02:33:21.601 --> 02:33:23.310
it's not possible that there's aliens.

2566
02:33:23.730 --> 02:33:27.870
What the problem is is these mother fuckers want to believe,

2567
02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:33.360
but that's not the guy.
Brian,
just Google Canada's former defense minister.

2568
02:33:33.390 --> 02:33:38.370
You have fun or aliens?
Um,
yeah,

2569
02:33:38.371 --> 02:33:41.040
he,
I've seen the video.
He was on our t.

2570
02:33:41.100 --> 02:33:45.000
He might have actually been talking to a,
hmm.
Excuse me.

2571
02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:46.170
Who is you talking to?

2572
02:33:49.180 --> 02:33:50.350
<v 8>Was he talking to Abby Martin?</v>

2573
02:33:50.380 --> 02:33:55.380
He was talking to like a group of people who's like in a is my girl Abby Martin.

2574
02:33:55.391 --> 02:33:59.980
It is,
let's go to,
no,
that's not him.
Brian.
He's a

2575
02:33:59.980 --> 02:34:03.970
<v 2>bald old guy.
No,
it's not Abby.
Martin says this cat.
It's this other girl.</v>

2576
02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:09.190
This is the guy.
Look for this one.
See this guy?
Yeah,
this is the,
that's done.

2577
02:34:09.220 --> 02:34:13.420
But that's not the video that you want.
The one with him on our team.
See,
look,

2578
02:34:13.450 --> 02:34:15.460
it's on the Daily Mail.
This is what you want.

2579
02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:20.650
This silly old who's crazy.
Oh,
that's the thing,
man.

2580
02:34:20.710 --> 02:34:24.440
But I'm in the room where the alien,
here's where the,

2581
02:34:24.441 --> 02:34:28.600
this note doesn't matter just because someone says something rationally.
Shut up.

2582
02:34:28.930 --> 02:34:32.320
No,
it's just he's a former defense minister and he's talking to a woman who's a

2583
02:34:32.321 --> 02:34:36.550
newspaper,
a news caster.
She's,
she's,
you know,
I mean,

2584
02:34:36.580 --> 02:34:38.860
whatever kind of journalism degree she has,

2585
02:34:38.861 --> 02:34:42.460
it doesn't mean that she's going to call bullshit on this fucking goofy old

2586
02:34:42.461 --> 02:34:44.590
crazy dude.
Look,

2587
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:48.940
there may very well be visitors from out of space.
It's very possible,

2588
02:34:48.941 --> 02:34:52.960
but it's also possible that a lot of these people are just nuts and that they

2589
02:34:52.961 --> 02:34:54.490
want to,
that's,
that's home boy.

2590
02:34:54.700 --> 02:34:58.210
They want to have like Ufos be real

2591
02:34:58.230 --> 02:35:02.010
<v 15>well activity on the last few decades since</v>

2592
02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:06.330
none of the atomic bomb and yeah.

2593
02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:09.880
<v 2>What's up with our sound?
I think it's the laptop hard drive.</v>

2594
02:35:09.881 --> 02:35:11.230
Let's get rid of that bitch today.

2595
02:35:11.340 --> 02:35:12.173
<v 15>Yeah,</v>

2596
02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:17.070
because the whole cosmos is a unity and it affects not just us,

2597
02:35:17.071 --> 02:35:20.630
but other people in the cosmos very much afraid.

2598
02:35:20.860 --> 02:35:23.410
<v 2>No,
this guy is crazy.
I could look at him like,
first of all,</v>

2599
02:35:23.411 --> 02:35:26.380
he looks like the creepy preacher guy from poltergeist,
which is,

2600
02:35:26.381 --> 02:35:29.650
I'm very offended by something that happens to a lot of these old cats.
They,

2601
02:35:29.660 --> 02:35:32.380
no one wants to fuck around anymore.
And there's,

2602
02:35:32.430 --> 02:35:34.750
there's no light at the end of the tunnel.
It's not going to change.

2603
02:35:34.751 --> 02:35:36.850
It's not like one day they're gonna become sexually attractive again.

2604
02:35:37.210 --> 02:35:41.380
And they look for some new meaning in life and what the new meaning in life that

2605
02:35:41.381 --> 02:35:46.381
takes away from all the worry and the wall that will worries and stress is if

2606
02:35:46.421 --> 02:35:48.820
there are aliens,
this whole life is bullshit.

2607
02:35:48.821 --> 02:35:51.580
So my miserable existence that I have,
my depressing,

2608
02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:56.760
miserable existence all of the sudden becomes trivial in comparison to the

2609
02:35:57.730 --> 02:36:01.150
mystery of the cosmos.
Right?
Aliens are real.

2610
02:36:01.210 --> 02:36:04.600
The whole world has been thrown on its head.
Money doesn't matter.

2611
02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:08.830
World politics don't matter.
Relationships don't matter.
The aliens are here.

2612
02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:11.740
Oh my God.
And change this idea.

2613
02:36:11.790 --> 02:36:16.420
It's almost like a religious epiphany sort of a moment for them.

2614
02:36:16.570 --> 02:36:19.020
It's like they're looking forward to,
uh,

2615
02:36:19.060 --> 02:36:23.980
it's almost like an apocalyptic scenario.
Not Apocalyptic,
but,
um,
uh,

2616
02:36:24.010 --> 02:36:28.690
what's the,
what's the term when God comes back?
Armageddon.
Well,
yeah,
revelation.

2617
02:36:28.691 --> 02:36:29.790
Revelation.
It's like,

2618
02:36:30.140 --> 02:36:34.810
like something that's gonna make our regular trivial,

2619
02:36:34.811 --> 02:36:38.020
everyday life that he's a failure at seem meaningless.

2620
02:36:38.350 --> 02:36:40.060
And I think that's a lot of these guys.

2621
02:36:40.061 --> 02:36:44.290
It's all these unfuckable white dudes that are out there finding new fos

2622
02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:50.140
Coachella this year.
It's a,
um,
it's a need.

2623
02:36:50.590 --> 02:36:53.920
It's a need for mystery.
It's a need for meaning in life.

2624
02:36:53.921 --> 02:36:58.180
And I think they distort reality in order to fulfill this need.

2625
02:36:58.420 --> 02:37:02.770
There's a great deal of attractiveness to mystery,
to solving mystery.

2626
02:37:02.771 --> 02:37:04.450
It's a part of our,
it's like,

2627
02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:09.480
I think it's almost like hijacks our natural a reward mechanisms that we have

2628
02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:10.810
built in.

2629
02:37:10.810 --> 02:37:14.260
Like we have this need to discover things because human beings have a need to

2630
02:37:14.261 --> 02:37:16.610
innovate so they can stay alive so that we can,
you know,

2631
02:37:16.611 --> 02:37:18.500
develop weapons and figured out how to make fire.

2632
02:37:18.650 --> 02:37:21.410
And so there's constant need to find out what are the mysteries,

2633
02:37:21.411 --> 02:37:24.060
who's planning things?
We need to find out who those people over there.

2634
02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:26.900
They're going to guess.
And these needs to solve mysteries.

2635
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:30.050
They're responsible for all these goddamn television shows that are on crime.

2636
02:37:30.290 --> 02:37:34.670
Every fucking TV show is about solving mysteries and solving crimes and who did

2637
02:37:34.671 --> 02:37:38.160
it?
Where's that mystery?
The big mystery is a the ends.

2638
02:37:38.420 --> 02:37:43.250
That's the grand finale.
That's the fight.
Good works in the 4th of July one,

2639
02:37:43.610 --> 02:37:47.240
that ancient alien show that scares the shit out of me.
Plus that guy's hair.

2640
02:37:47.270 --> 02:37:50.960
Well,
Giorgio sucralose.
It was a very nice guy as is Philip Copans,

2641
02:37:50.990 --> 02:37:53.600
the late Great Phillip Copans who we had on the podcast.

2642
02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:57.170
We had two guys from ancient aliens on.
Great guys.
I love that shit.

2643
02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:01.700
I love that show too.
How am not stoned though?
I can't do it stone.

2644
02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:04.070
I'm just like,
Oh God,
they're right there.

2645
02:38:04.490 --> 02:38:07.580
That was a really fascinating subject and they're right about a lot of things,

2646
02:38:07.670 --> 02:38:11.240
but they also skirt around facts sometimes in order to make their case a little

2647
02:38:11.241 --> 02:38:15.290
bit stronger and there was an ancient aliens debunked video that someone put

2648
02:38:15.291 --> 02:38:18.590
online,
really explained what's wrong with a lot of things.

2649
02:38:18.591 --> 02:38:21.920
They say they'd make a lot of conclusions where they jump immediately to aliens.

2650
02:38:22.190 --> 02:38:26.540
You know,
it had to have been extra terrestrial beings,

2651
02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:29.740
extra terrestrial knowledge press.

2652
02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:34.920
Is it possible that extra terrestrials created humans to mind for copper?

2653
02:38:36.350 --> 02:38:38.930
You know,
like they have all these crazy theories.
They're fun.

2654
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:44.030
It is fun to sit around and watch.
But as far as like scholarly work,

2655
02:38:44.930 --> 02:38:48.860
there's almost none that make any sense about aliens.

2656
02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:53.120
Some inch ancient images and there's some artwork that's pretty fascinating.

2657
02:38:53.330 --> 02:38:57.680
There's a lot of ancient Egyptian iconography,
you know,

2658
02:38:57.740 --> 02:39:01.430
they're hiring lifts some fascinating Erich von Daniken.
Yeah.

2659
02:39:01.820 --> 02:39:03.080
Who did chariots of the gods,

2660
02:39:03.130 --> 02:39:05.960
which is a great book and it really interesting documentary.

2661
02:39:06.230 --> 02:39:09.830
Well it even if he's wrong about chariots of the gods,

2662
02:39:09.890 --> 02:39:13.700
about the origins of these different things in his documentary,

2663
02:39:13.790 --> 02:39:16.270
even if he's wrong about them being extraterrestrial,

2664
02:39:16.710 --> 02:39:19.100
there are still fascinating mysteries.

2665
02:39:19.220 --> 02:39:22.730
They're fascinating and mysteries that most likely where a lot of really

2666
02:39:22.731 --> 02:39:25.100
sophisticated construction methods that we don't know about.

2667
02:39:25.101 --> 02:39:26.840
Now that we lost that somewhere in another,

2668
02:39:27.020 --> 02:39:32.020
it was lost in some raid like getting raided by the Romans or the Mongols or who

2669
02:39:33.021 --> 02:39:34.520
knows where the fuck the information went.

2670
02:39:34.521 --> 02:39:38.060
But there was a lot of like really sophisticated construction techniques

2671
02:39:38.061 --> 02:39:42.050
thousands and thousands of years ago.
That's much more likely than this.

2672
02:39:42.051 --> 02:39:46.880
All this shit was created by aliens,
but the actual images and the,

2673
02:39:46.881 --> 02:39:51.710
um,
the actual sites in the mysteries themselves are still fascinating and maybe

2674
02:39:51.711 --> 02:39:54.020
even more fascinating if it wasn't aliens.

2675
02:39:54.110 --> 02:39:58.550
The fact that people were so fucking smart 4,500 years ago that they made the

2676
02:39:58.551 --> 02:40:02.870
pyramids.
I mean,
that's incredible.
And that's a fact.
I mean they carbon date the,

2677
02:40:02.871 --> 02:40:06.440
the stuff inside the pyramids that it goes back to 2,500 BC.

2678
02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:11.270
So they're pretty goddamn shore that someone at least was living there,

2679
02:40:11.310 --> 02:40:14.160
2,500 BC and it was already built.
But just

2680
02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:18.090
<v 0>the fact that it's at least 5,000 years old or 4,500 years old,</v>

2681
02:40:18.091 --> 02:40:22.770
just at least at least that old,
that his god damn fascinating.
I've been there.

2682
02:40:22.771 --> 02:40:26.220
And when you see them like that,
you're just like,
wow.

2683
02:40:26.580 --> 02:40:30.030
Even the Sphinx to,
I've never been there,
but I've been to church teaching Eatsa,

2684
02:40:30.270 --> 02:40:33.620
I saw the Mayan Pyramids.
I want to do that.
That were mind blowing.
Yeah.

2685
02:40:33.870 --> 02:40:35.040
You just stop and think about it.

2686
02:40:35.041 --> 02:40:40.041
These fucking people living in a stone age time got these goddamn rocks and put

2687
02:40:41.370 --> 02:40:44.490
them basins of water.
There's like caves.
They're just filled with water.

2688
02:40:44.690 --> 02:40:46.320
How'd you get these rocks here?
What did you do?

2689
02:40:46.590 --> 02:40:50.390
How did you make this fucking giant structure a thousand years ago or whatever

2690
02:40:50.430 --> 02:40:55.290
system stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's amazing.
Amazing Shit.
It's one of my favorite movies.

2691
02:40:55.291 --> 02:40:58.950
Apocalypto I love that movie.
But the people love to go.
That's a good fun.

2692
02:40:58.950 --> 02:41:00.630
It's a great movie.
You know it's a good movie too,

2693
02:41:00.631 --> 02:41:04.890
cause it's like right when he was being shamed and people realize like,
yeah,

2694
02:41:04.891 --> 02:41:09.030
he's crazy,
but God damn that mother fucker knows.
I love that movie.

2695
02:41:09.060 --> 02:41:11.970
That didn't get enough credit,
right?
Didn't,
I don't think it did.
I think it,
it,

2696
02:41:12.070 --> 02:41:15.570
it did.
It went,
yeah.
But I don't think,

2697
02:41:15.571 --> 02:41:17.910
I think everyone was kind of in that shame phase where like,
oh,

2698
02:41:17.911 --> 02:41:20.340
we're not going to support it,
but it's a great film.
Well,

2699
02:41:20.341 --> 02:41:22.950
the passion of the Christ.
I didn't see that one was,

2700
02:41:22.951 --> 02:41:26.400
I saw that that was not a good movie.
Yeah,
it was a,

2701
02:41:26.410 --> 02:41:30.030
it was basically a two hour movie about a dude who was magic,

2702
02:41:30.031 --> 02:41:33.720
who got his ass kicked.
I mean that was exactly what the movie was.

2703
02:41:34.050 --> 02:41:36.860
It was just two hours of them beating the shit out of the guy.

2704
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:40.530
It was almost like a,
it was almost perverted in a way.

2705
02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:45.560
It was like people were like taking like some sort of pleasure out of this

2706
02:41:46.081 --> 02:41:49.410
torture film.
It was almost like a snuff film because yeah,

2707
02:41:49.411 --> 02:41:52.800
I know it's representative of the Lord and representative of our savior and all

2708
02:41:52.801 --> 02:41:56.790
that good stuff,
but the movie wasn't that.
The movie was just violence.

2709
02:41:56.820 --> 02:41:59.420
I remember a lot of people saying that it was like,
and I don't,

2710
02:41:59.421 --> 02:42:01.800
I think that's the reason why I didn't want to go see it because everyone's
like,

2711
02:42:01.830 --> 02:42:04.320
oh,
you're going to cry.
And I'm like,
that's what they want you to do.

2712
02:42:04.321 --> 02:42:06.990
They want you to,
Oh God,
look what we did.

2713
02:42:06.991 --> 02:42:09.720
Look what they did to him and it's like,
it was,

2714
02:42:09.750 --> 02:42:13.590
it was such a push and just like they threw it in your face,
just,
you know,

2715
02:42:13.620 --> 02:42:15.270
nonstop.
Do you know what's interesting now?

2716
02:42:15.270 --> 02:42:19.140
You don't hear about that movie anymore.
Not like,
it was a huge,
it was massive.

2717
02:42:19.141 --> 02:42:21.350
Yeah.
But it's,
it didn't last.
Yeah.

2718
02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:24.720
Like it's not something that people go and wash the day and talk about why the

2719
02:42:24.721 --> 02:42:28.440
passion of the Christ today reaffirmed my faith.
Hashtag God bless.

2720
02:42:28.860 --> 02:42:32.350
That doesn't happen.
Right?
Like maybe it happens.
It was like a secret.
Very off.

2721
02:42:32.370 --> 02:42:34.080
The secret was that,
remember the secret,

2722
02:42:34.260 --> 02:42:38.040
the secret is Mel Gibson's fucking crazy.
And when that secret got out,

2723
02:42:38.041 --> 02:42:41.790
everybody was like,
oh,
well fuck it.
I'm not going to see this fucking movie.

2724
02:42:42.090 --> 02:42:45.330
And then the one before that with Willem Defoe,
remember that one?

2725
02:42:46.470 --> 02:42:51.160
Which one was that?
There was a,
a Christ movie with Willem Defoe.
Very,

2726
02:42:51.370 --> 02:42:56.160
very controversial.
Yes.
Yes,
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes.
Uh,
the last supper.

2727
02:42:56.370 --> 02:43:00.960
No,
the something,
something of Christ.
Citation of Christ in 1988,

2728
02:43:01.580 --> 02:43:06.280
four stars,
Ladies and gentlemen.
Willem defoe was Saks green goblin.

2729
02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:09.960
He was saxy.
Those cheekbones hadn't quite made him creepy yet.

2730
02:43:10.260 --> 02:43:12.200
It was just in,
in

2731
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:16.300

2733

2734

Russell Crowe.
Russell grow.
Yeah,
so crows,
the director.

2735
02:43:28.241 --> 02:43:33.160
It's like a good director.
I'm not so sure I MDB that there's,
there's Noah,

2736
02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:35.950
there's exodus.
Exodus is coming out as well,

2737
02:43:36.590 --> 02:43:39.570
so there's a Barman Darren or knob.

2738
02:43:40.210 --> 02:43:42.560
That guy's a bad motherfucker.
Why is he doing no?

2739
02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:48.190
Well it looks very like fight to like there.
It looks very the 300 like,

2740
02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:49.151
right?
Yeah.

2741
02:43:49.151 --> 02:43:53.170
There's like the guys coming out of the woods like go to the dark brown.
Yeah.

2742
02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:57.310
Just like,
hey.
Yeah.
This isn't your King James version.

2743
02:43:57.370 --> 02:43:58.840
It's if you've ever seen the ad,

2744
02:44:00.250 --> 02:44:04.150
I saw no Superbowl ad for it.
It's all extreme,
right?

2745
02:44:04.151 --> 02:44:07.510
The trail explosions.
Pull it up.
We'll,
we'll end on this.
We'll end on Noah.

2746
02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:12.010
Noah movie official.
Big Game.
Started with a massive volcano.

2747
02:44:12.011 --> 02:44:16.770
We're going to end with a super bowl ad.
Noah,
just pull up that Superbowl ad out.

2748
02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:19.150
No,
and this will be the last day you hear the shitty laptop.

2749
02:44:19.151 --> 02:44:23.440
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think replace the phrase God,
am I right?
Praise Jesus.

2750
02:44:23.950 --> 02:44:28.190
Praise Jesus.
Praise David Koch cash.
No a play.

2751
02:44:28.270 --> 02:44:31.990
Praise Anthony Hopkins.
Isn't everything.
Praise Odin.

2752
02:44:33.250 --> 02:44:36.670
Praise owed and praise.
Odin is like a hashtag

2753
02:44:39.630 --> 02:44:41.680
stolen.
CanNot be stopped.
It can be survive.

2754
02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:49.990
Stop.
It sounds killing me.
Sorry.

2755
02:44:50.380 --> 02:44:54.220
It's almost like it's almost like taking,
it's like taking the Bible.

2756
02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:56.860
It's like we've got to save our family.
I'm like,
no,

2757
02:44:56.861 --> 02:44:58.930
it wasn't the world covered and from water.

2758
02:44:59.080 --> 02:45:03.310
And why is Liam Neeson kicking everybody's ass at 60 what's going on there?
