<v Speaker 1>what you guys do,</v>

00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:33.020
<v Speaker 1>couple of podcasts,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this achievement oriented mindset and</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it towards this company.</v>

41
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>And it's fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I just got into it because I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make stuff.</v>

44
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted better performing products.</v>

45
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>It's what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we created the category was sick of back</v>

46
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:03.651
<v Speaker 1>of the day is back in 2004 because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing all mountain their anger and</v>

47
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>wondered why I was the only person that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted that style,</v>

48
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>that type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that performance level of hunting.</v>

49
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I didn't believe that I was alone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>came up with a concept,</v>

50
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>introduced it and oh six to the hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>market and exploded credit,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's with everyone wants to wear and</v>

53
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>makes a significant difference for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>customers in the mountains.</v>

54
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bit of this,</v>

55
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.120
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>hunting people are kind of fashion east</v>
<v Speaker 1>does in a way.</v>

57
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

58
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.011
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you got there?</v>

59
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 1>I was an underwriter who was at first</v>
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>

60
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Like they start like looking at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

61
00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>almost like girls look at shoes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>purses and shit.</v>

62
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really kind of interesting that</v>

63
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:40.651
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

64
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>no one likes to go to a hunting camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be out geared.</v>

65
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your buddy's got the coolest,</v>

66
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>latest step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

67
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why I wanted to have</v>

69
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:52.791
<v Speaker 1>you guys on is cause I've done the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>job I can of trying to educate people as</v>

70
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>to what I see when I talk to people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are really intelligent,</v>

71
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>really ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

72
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>very involved</v>

73
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 2>people that are fanatics about hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think there people have of</v>

74
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 2>distorted perception of what hunting</v>
<v Speaker 2>really is.</v>

75
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Totally do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Yahoo's beer drinkers being</v>

76
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 2>Baba Baba banners is above a redneck</v>
<v Speaker 2>striving and drinking beer,</v>

77
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 2>shooting stuff out of the truck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's so not that our customer base</v>

78
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:22.180
<v Speaker 2>and what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a true lifestyle as a</v>

79
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 2>heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been passed down in my family.</v>

80
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.900
<v Speaker 2>It's where we live and breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why I'm I trained every day.</v>

81
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what my focus is on my life and,</v>

82
00:03:30.981 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 2>and what I've done for a career in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

83
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot to it.</v>

84
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 2>And the places we go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we require that or you're going to pay a</v>

85
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge price.</v>

86
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a way for me to test myself</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

87
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 2>as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a man,</v>

88
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.443
<v Speaker 2>as a hunter.</v>

89
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 2>And a life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's something that,</v>

90
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

91
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.200
<v Speaker 2>is a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big part of me.</v>

92
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 2>It's been passed down from my father and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm passing down to my kids and,</v>

93
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.401
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 2>we've been hunters for 2 million years</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fricking proud of it.</v>

95
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people shy away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's something that,</v>

96
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is really,</v>

97
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 2>really obviously very important part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>

98
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of high performance,</v>

99
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super skilled things where you also have</v>

100
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 2>a lowest common denominator kind of guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're associated with.</v>

101
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if mountaineers,</v>

102
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a guy that was wearing a white tank</v>

103
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:20.860
<v Speaker 2>top and was down at the climbing gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fallen,</v>

104
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 2>operate in his head every week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would perceive him slightly</v>

105
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He runs,</v>

106
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys that are doing the most extreme</v>

107
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:30.860
<v Speaker 2>stuff in the world and the purse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the perceived person that's down here.</v>

108
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 2>So you know what people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get lumped in with the lowest common</v>

109
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 2>denominator guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not not the case at all.</v>

110
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

111
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.260
<v Speaker 2>that's a really good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

112
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.573
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

113
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

114
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:43.500
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly what we're doing and</v>

115
00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're testing our products.</v>

116
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we argue that it's,</v>

117
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 2>it's a different format than even</v>
<v Speaker 2>outdoor gear.</v>

118
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean were when the weather's bad and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on a climb,</v>

119
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 2>you stay in your tent when the weather's</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad and we're on a hunt,</v>

120
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.230
<v Speaker 2>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

121
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're not bringing much</v>
<v Speaker 2>food and you're counting on killing</v>

122
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 2>something and eating it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're totally,</v>

123
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an endeavor that's a very,</v>

124
00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 2>very difficult and misunderstood</v>
<v Speaker 2>endeavor.</v>

125
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.470
<v Speaker 2>He really is and I think companies like</v>
<v Speaker 2>yours and what you guys are doing in the</v>

126
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.310
<v Speaker 2>videos that you release on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're going over the</v>

127
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 2>extreme engineering involved in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>packs and your gear and all the</v>

128
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 2>different thing.</v>

129
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 2>To me that stuff's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is because I love people that are</v>

130
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 2>just going for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are just engineering the shit out</v>

131
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys are chopping down toothbrushes</v>

132
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 2>to make them lighter and all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing.</v>

133
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Like I was listening to one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>

134
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 2>we talk about your excel sheet that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a spreadsheet that you made every,</v>

135
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 2>every hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You weigh everything out so you know</v>

136
00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:40.930
<v Speaker 2>exactly what everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways before you're going onto a</v>

137
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:41.950
<v Speaker 2>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>

138
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 2>for what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

139
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean you look at any endurance sports</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you look at,</v>

140
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:50.290
<v Speaker 2>cycling is a great example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean ounces they've proven are huge.</v>

141
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.140
<v Speaker 2>If you're climbing on a bike and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bike weight and the,</v>

142
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 2>and the bodyweight on all that leads to</v>
<v Speaker 2>better performance.</v>

143
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>And we found the same to</v>

144
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 3>be with with what we're doing on</v>
<v Speaker 3>backpack cards.</v>

145
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean every ounce over a 10 day hunt</v>
<v Speaker 3>really adds up in calorie burn and</v>

146
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 3>calorie deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which then turns out to be performance</v>

147
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 3>and know well from training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's also,</v>

148
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:14.171
<v Speaker 3>you guys have engineered these clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The clothing line is incredibly quiet,</v>

149
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 3>which is also really important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>

150
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 3>there's so many different levels to</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting it right when it comes to</v>

151
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 3>hunting gear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting it right when it comes to,</v>

152
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

153
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 3>it could be the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>success and failure.</v>

154
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 3>And this is one of the things that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to kind of highlight about this</v>

155
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.880
<v Speaker 3>pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

156
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Speaker 3>and I don't like to call hunting a sport</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a discipline mean call whatever you</v>

157
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>

158
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

159
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

160
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is what it is.</v>

161
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 3>It's weird that you have to lump it into</v>
<v Speaker 3>this other thing,</v>

162
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 3>but I think that people have a distorted</v>
<v Speaker 3>perception of it because of what you</v>

163
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:49.110
<v Speaker 3>said because of this lowest common</v>
<v Speaker 3>denominator guide,</v>

164
00:06:49.111 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bubba thing.</v>

165
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 3>But the more I've gotten into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more I've met people like you guys</v>

166
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 3>or people like Cam Haynes or Steve</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rinella,</v>

167
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 3>Remy Warren,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you get deep end.</v>

168
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 3>You realize like this is a really</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult discipline.</v>

169
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult.</v>

170
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 3>That has many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

171
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 3>many layers to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really does.</v>

172
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at the,</v>

173
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:10.340
<v Speaker 3>some of the expeditions we were doing up</v>
<v Speaker 3>north,</v>

174
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd go up to the Yukon or Alaska or</v>

175
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:15.320
<v Speaker 3>northwest territory's and when we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going from point a to point b,</v>

176
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:17.450
<v Speaker 3>like normal exposition with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there were hunting,</v>

177
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On top of that.</v>

178
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.450
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we've got to manage the game</v>

179
00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:23.540
<v Speaker 3>that we take out on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weight and the extremes and the</v>

180
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:24.680
<v Speaker 3>conditions and the weather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

181
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 3>it adds to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

182
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:29.210
<v Speaker 3>you have to be really well prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

183
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically,</v>

184
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:32.720
<v Speaker 3>mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also with the right equipment and</v>

185
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:33.554
<v Speaker 3>gear.</v>

186
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:34.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you had in the mountains on some</v>

187
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:35.691
<v Speaker 3>of the stuff we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

188
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:38.450
<v Speaker 3>it's not like it's comparable with</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountaineering,</v>

189
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:39.920
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to,</v>

190
00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:41.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a to b.</v>

191
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 3>You just got to survive to ADB.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

192
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 3>you have to thrive in the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to understand what's going on</v>

193
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:47.930
<v Speaker 3>with the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're up early or up late.</v>

194
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

195
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 3>it's even more in depth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then just getting from point a to</v>

196
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 3>point b.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of these places were going,</v>

197
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 3>there is no reason to ever go there</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you were hunting.</v>

198
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just some random mountain in the middle</v>

199
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:02.980
<v Speaker 3>of the ice glacier that not particularly</v>
<v Speaker 3>tall,</v>

200
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.150
<v Speaker 3>not particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like there's no reason to go there</v>

201
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.860
<v Speaker 3>unless you had something to go there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>look for.</v>

202
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:10.070
<v Speaker 3>And that's the cool thing we were seeing</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that nobody would ever go see.</v>

203
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a to B with a very complex</v>

204
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:14.900
<v Speaker 3>biological puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

205
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.601
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

206
00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 3>it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so different than,</v>

207
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.890
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people think of it.</v>

208
00:08:18.891 --> 00:08:20.690
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things I like about your</v>
<v Speaker 3>companies,</v>

209
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:23.240
<v Speaker 3>you guys are represented by this big</v>
<v Speaker 3>horn sheep.</v>

210
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is like a part of your logo,</v>

211
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the most difficult</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals to pursue sheep pennings at</v>

212
00:08:28.161 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 3>pinnacle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

213
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.780
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

214
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 3>it defines for Brennan and I and for</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the company and the people who</v>

215
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 3>associate with a brand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

216
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 3>it is the ultimate dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what we all dreamt about growing</v>

217
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:39.860
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As someday I would be a sheep hunter.</v>

218
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.880
<v Speaker 3>I'll earn the right to go sheep hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's so difficult.</v>

219
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.400
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The opportunities are limited.</v>

220
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.760
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's an animal that lives in places</v>

221
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:50.420
<v Speaker 3>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

222
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.980
<v Speaker 3>we can visit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can't live there.</v>

223
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they live in places that you just,</v>

224
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.303
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

225
00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.720
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we only get to like a snippet into</v>

226
00:08:57.721 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into their life.</v>

227
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's places you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

228
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.660
<v Speaker 3>you just can't live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

229
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 3>you can't go there and you can die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

230
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.500
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

231
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean a Cam Haines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good buddy Roy Roth died just this past</v>

232
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.630
<v Speaker 3>season fell 700 feet to his death while</v>
<v Speaker 3>she hunting.</v>

233
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.190
<v Speaker 3>I was hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

234
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.600
<v Speaker 3>I had a tag in Alaska and that you gach</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

235
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 3>couple a little ways over from there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went 37 miles in,</v>

236
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:23.694
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

237
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 3>up to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to two forks of a glacier.</v>

238
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:28.470
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got to where you could physically a</v>

239
00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:30.900
<v Speaker 3>human being without climbing gear could</v>
<v Speaker 3>not go any further.</v>

240
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Where I killed my sheep is fall 15 year</v>
<v Speaker 3>old ram living up in the rocks.</v>

241
00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.900
<v Speaker 3>And I mean it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is some of the,</v>

242
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 3>that's some of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's some of the toughest country in</v>

243
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

244
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.120
<v Speaker 3>It means brushy and ice and nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

245
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

246
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.120
<v Speaker 3>it's not pleasurable to go in there like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to,</v>

247
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.060
<v Speaker 3>to really go into something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Do,</v>

248
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.870
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a goal or a reason to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be in there.</v>

249
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:56.820
<v Speaker 3>It's not like I'm going to go grind out</v>
<v Speaker 3>this miserable brush and you know,</v>

250
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:57.803
<v Speaker 3>poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

251
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.360
<v Speaker 3>shitty rainy weather home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

252
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.051
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just like,</v>

253
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:03.990
<v Speaker 3>why would you be there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause you go there because you want to</v>

254
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:04.740
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

255
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.950
<v Speaker 3>is this is going to test me and you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to see if you can match wits with this</v>

256
00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:09.240
<v Speaker 3>animal and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

257
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.580
<v Speaker 3>you want to go see if you're up for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge.</v>

258
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what we've been doing for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the world's oldest and greatest</v>

259
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:15.241
<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

260
00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:16.050
<v Speaker 3>if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

261
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:21.050
<v Speaker 3>you were either a hunter or a berry</v>
<v Speaker 3>picker and the the level of intensity</v>

262
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:24.720
<v Speaker 3>that's involved in that moment when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually try to take that animal after</v>

263
00:10:24.721 --> 00:10:29.721
<v Speaker 3>that incredible hiking after 37 miles of</v>
<v Speaker 3>risking your life to get to that point.</v>

264
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:34.050
<v Speaker 3>And then that moments there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the extreme amount of pressure and</v>

265
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:39.051
<v Speaker 3>intensity involved in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That to me is what defines the real</v>

266
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 3>challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate challenge of hunting and</v>

267
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:47.850
<v Speaker 3>this idea that it's a bunch of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that like killing animals or it's a</v>

268
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:50.370
<v Speaker 3>bunch of fat Yahoos and sit around</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking beer.</v>

269
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.040
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's way,</v>

270
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.350
<v Speaker 3>there's way more to this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is more an insane,</v>

271
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.530
<v Speaker 3>like really primal pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

272
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.710
<v Speaker 3>We always say you're either a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like Brendon mentioned a berry</v>

273
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:04.200
<v Speaker 3>picker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in our DNA if you're a hunter.</v>

274
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:09.230
<v Speaker 3>And to be able to test that against the</v>
<v Speaker 3>toughest conditions against the hardest</v>

275
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:13.560
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hunt the most remote places is to me</v>

276
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate test of being a human being</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ultimate test of being a hunter.</v>

277
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.190
<v Speaker 3>And that's what drives me and what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

278
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:21.450
<v Speaker 3>And why they train year round.</v>

279
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:22.650
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always thinking about gear,</v>

280
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 3>about food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Wade,</v>

281
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:25.110
<v Speaker 3>about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

282
00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:25.740
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

283
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.610
<v Speaker 3>how I could improve from what I learned</v>
<v Speaker 3>on last year sent to this coming</v>

284
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:30.370
<v Speaker 3>seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

285
00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.060
<v Speaker 3>and preparation of it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fun.</v>

286
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.033
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

287
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.360
<v Speaker 3>I live it and breathe it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

288
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:38.070
<v Speaker 3>it's challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really challenging.</v>

289
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it unfolded for me,</v>

290
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it still continues to do so because</v>

291
00:11:42.511 --> 00:11:44.340
<v Speaker 3>I've only been doing it for four years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

292
00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Rinella got me involved and he took me</v>
<v Speaker 3>out to Montana in 2012.</v>

293
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.920
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

294
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:50.361
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

295
00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:51.450
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of be interesting.</v>

296
00:11:51.451 --> 00:11:54.550
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what this is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I had watched shows and I read</v>

297
00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:56.920
<v Speaker 3>some stuff about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that he said,</v>

298
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:57.401
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

299
00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:00.220
<v Speaker 3>there's a steep learning curve to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a steep lines.</v>

300
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:01.210
<v Speaker 3>Then it goes long.</v>

301
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:01.961
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

302
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:03.840
<v Speaker 3>how long can it go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fucking find an animal.</v>

303
00:12:03.841 --> 00:12:05.930
<v Speaker 3>You shoot it and kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Need it seem so hard.</v>

304
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 3>But then as you get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize and then of course bow</v>

305
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:11.830
<v Speaker 3>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the most difficult of the most</v>

306
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 3>difficult pursuits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as you get into it,</v>

307
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 3>you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

308
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:20.340
<v Speaker 3>this is like some crazy puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like some crazy challenge that you</v>

309
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:23.830
<v Speaker 3>have to figure that also involves a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>to procure your food.</v>

310
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.500
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a skill set you never quit</v>

311
00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 3>learning on every time you go out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned something new.</v>

312
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

313
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.380
<v Speaker 4>there's a natural progression you go</v>
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>

314
00:12:32.381 --> 00:12:34.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're just excited to be</v>

315
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:35.104
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

316
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.530
<v Speaker 4>And then your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you see it with people you've</v>

317
00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:39.880
<v Speaker 4>take out through first time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just like,</v>

318
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.530
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of what's what's going on here.</v>

319
00:12:41.531 --> 00:12:43.330
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then then all of a sudden they get a</v>

320
00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:45.670
<v Speaker 4>little click and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get one,</v>

321
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.110
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

322
00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's usually a couple of years.</v>

323
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:49.780
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

324
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.580
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get,</v>

325
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get a nicer one than one I</v>
<v Speaker 4>got last time and I want,</v>

326
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:54.520
<v Speaker 4>you want to do something a little more</v>
<v Speaker 4>challenging.</v>

327
00:12:54.521 --> 00:12:56.590
<v Speaker 4>And it just keeps progressing until</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

328
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>until you get,</v>

329
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever it ends and it's,</v>

330
00:13:00.311 --> 00:13:03.760
<v Speaker 4>it's you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're hunting the toughest animals,</v>

331
00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:06.100
<v Speaker 4>the biggest animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the oldest animals and the toughest</v>

332
00:13:06.101 --> 00:13:09.430
<v Speaker 4>conditions and being successful and know</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people won't get there.</v>

333
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.360
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

334
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.790
<v Speaker 4>it's always a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something that never gets old.</v>

335
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.943
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

336
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as comparable to any athletic event only</v>

337
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:18.610
<v Speaker 4>you can do it for your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

338
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:23.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's lots of stuff you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>athletic and then in growing up or</v>

339
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:25.630
<v Speaker 4>whatever and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't really translate,</v>

340
00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:27.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a college wrestler that doesn't</v>

341
00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:30.220
<v Speaker 4>translate that well to do the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your life.</v>

342
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.880
<v Speaker 4>If you're that dude down there at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>intermural wrestling like Ah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>hunting is the one thing that is just</v>
<v Speaker 4>throughout your entire life.</v>

345
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 4>Depending on where you're at.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you don't have a ton of time,</v>

350
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:48.520
<v Speaker 4>you can do a short on sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

351
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 4>things are going well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do something that's,</v>

352
00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:51.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an epic adventure.</v>

353
00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:54.280
<v Speaker 4>But it's always a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It never gets easy though.</v>

354
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:55.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

355
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the animal you killed last time does not</v>

356
00:13:57.311 --> 00:14:01.150
<v Speaker 4>care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The new animal you're hunting does not</v>

357
00:14:01.151 --> 00:14:02.980
<v Speaker 4>care what you got last time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to go out,</v>

358
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:05.080
<v Speaker 4>you gotta be sharp every single time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

359
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:05.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

360
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.060
<v Speaker 3>everything has to be done right every</v>
<v Speaker 3>single time.</v>

361
00:14:08.061 --> 00:14:08.541
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

362
00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:13.541
<v Speaker 3>And what I like about guys like youtube</v>
<v Speaker 3>is you take two dudes like yourselves</v>

363
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.390
<v Speaker 3>who are both like real goal oriented</v>
<v Speaker 3>savages.</v>

364
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:21.110
<v Speaker 3>And you put together a company like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>that pursues that one ultimate</v>

365
00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:23.750
<v Speaker 3>experience and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the best shit that we can make?</v>

366
00:14:23.751 --> 00:14:26.450
<v Speaker 3>What is the best way we can pursue this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do.</v>

367
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why I built,</v>

368
00:14:28.611 --> 00:14:29.391
<v Speaker 3>could you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way it did,</v>

369
00:14:29.391 --> 00:14:31.220
<v Speaker 3>having learned from Sitka selling to</v>
<v Speaker 3>retailers,</v>

370
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:35.000
<v Speaker 3>the limits of what we can produce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was super frustrated.</v>

371
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.480
<v Speaker 3>The fact that I was walking away from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best materials and walking away from</v>

372
00:14:38.481 --> 00:14:41.570
<v Speaker 3>the best innovations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when we sold that company to Gore</v>

373
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Tex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had the freedom to go start something</v>

374
00:14:43.311 --> 00:14:48.311
<v Speaker 3>new and to eliminate the retailers so I</v>
<v Speaker 3>could go build a business platform</v>

375
00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.360
<v Speaker 3>specifically.</v>

376
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.210
<v Speaker 3>So I could go out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take these amazing materials,</v>

377
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 3>amazing designs to mark that I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>do before and get them to market through</v>

378
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.630
<v Speaker 3>this brand Kuya which has made all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>

379
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Well isn't it interesting that this has</v>
<v Speaker 3>all happened at the same time where the</v>

380
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:06.580
<v Speaker 3>Internet has kind of exploded in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>way that people are doing perfect time,</v>

381
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.570
<v Speaker 3>massive amount of shopping online's</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

382
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have a one of those uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mailboxes where they get your packages</v>

383
00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:15.200
<v Speaker 3>for the company and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

384
00:15:15.201 --> 00:15:19.190
<v Speaker 3>when I used him 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd get like a package every couple days</v>

385
00:15:19.191 --> 00:15:21.740
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now every time I go there is stacks and</v>

386
00:15:21.741 --> 00:15:22.431
<v Speaker 3>boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

387
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 3>Cause I do like all my shopping online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone does now.</v>

388
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy thing how that's happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you guys,</v>

389
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:32.840
<v Speaker 3>like right as your company started was</v>
<v Speaker 3>right at the same time.</v>

390
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like you caught that wave right at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crest.</v>

391
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:40.160
<v Speaker 3>When I look back it's like we</v>
<v Speaker 3>orchestrated it and timed it perfect and</v>

392
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:43.610
<v Speaker 3>like we could see the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see the downfall it he called</v>

393
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:44.171
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Brennan,</v>

394
00:15:44.171 --> 00:15:47.000
<v Speaker 3>I talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see there's a problem with retail</v>

395
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.540
<v Speaker 3>when you can't produce the best products</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible for your customers because they</v>

396
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:52.670
<v Speaker 3>can't sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't have the value any longer</v>

397
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.980
<v Speaker 3>because all zur offering is price and</v>
<v Speaker 3>selection.</v>

398
00:15:54.981 --> 00:15:59.240
<v Speaker 3>So price wins in a see a selection with</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one there to explain why a new</v>

399
00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:00.860
<v Speaker 3>product so much better than the old</v>
<v Speaker 3>product.</v>

400
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.420
<v Speaker 3>There's a problem and I saw it coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now you see it,</v>

401
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting exacerbated everyday with new</v>

402
00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:11.450
<v Speaker 3>reports about retailers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>failing malls going out of business.</v>

403
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.700
<v Speaker 3>Retail is in big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big trouble.</v>

404
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:14.940
<v Speaker 3>Amazons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

405
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.100
<v Speaker 3>made that happen faster.</v>

406
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.040
<v Speaker 3>The Internet's made it happen and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>all looking back with [inaudible].</v>

407
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.680
<v Speaker 3>Timing was everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

408
00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:24.770
<v Speaker 3>as you know with business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know a lot of it is timing luck and</v>

409
00:16:24.771 --> 00:16:27.260
<v Speaker 3>be in the right place at the right time</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the right concepts and ideas.</v>

410
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.170
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't totally nailed it and we kind</v>

411
00:16:30.171 --> 00:16:34.670
<v Speaker 3>of came in at the exact same time with</v>
<v Speaker 3>on it that you guys did with [inaudible]</v>

412
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.450
<v Speaker 3>and with the same exact model,</v>
<v Speaker 3>selling directly to people getting the</v>

413
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:42.050
<v Speaker 3>very best shit you can possibly get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the like forget about cost.</v>

414
00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:45.860
<v Speaker 3>What is the best most imp?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most nutrient dense foods?</v>

415
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.130
<v Speaker 3>Most nutrient dense supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's figure out a way to get the best</v>

416
00:16:49.131 --> 00:16:52.040
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find who's got the best protein powder?</v>

417
00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:54.560
<v Speaker 3>Who's got the best?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's cost prohibitive because of</v>

418
00:16:54.561 --> 00:16:56.230
<v Speaker 3>this and the retail gets marked down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

419
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:57.230
<v Speaker 3>That's the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

420
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.840
<v Speaker 3>Is like when you sell something to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>retailer,</v>

421
00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:04.841
<v Speaker 3>like a Cabela's or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tack on a bunch of money on him a</v>

422
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:05.810
<v Speaker 3>ton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

423
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.960
<v Speaker 3>Then make a lot more money than we did a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred percent so we've made money then</v>

424
00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:09.501
<v Speaker 3>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

425
00:17:09.501 --> 00:17:11.510
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they tack on a hundred percent or</v>

426
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.160
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a jacket I had produced for a hundred</v>

427
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.490
<v Speaker 3>I'd sell the Kybella is for 200 they</v>
<v Speaker 3>sell to you for 400 bucks.</v>

428
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.820
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For putting on a coat hanger and thrown</v>

429
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:21.950
<v Speaker 3>it on a rack makes it convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

430
00:17:21.951 --> 00:17:25.100
<v Speaker 3>if you're like in a place and you need a</v>
<v Speaker 3>jacket and you left your jacket at home,</v>

431
00:17:25.101 --> 00:17:27.590
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a faulty model.</v>

432
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.140
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a guy like you that does</v>

433
00:17:30.141 --> 00:17:34.220
<v Speaker 3>research and knows exactly what he wants</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can put a tape measure on</v>

434
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:35.630
<v Speaker 3>yourself and know how big you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

435
00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:40.631
<v Speaker 3>I'm roughly an xl and you could save</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself money and get a better product.</v>

436
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.310
<v Speaker 3>It's a no brainer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll also,</v>

437
00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.760
<v Speaker 3>the amount of research that you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you go to a store and you talked</v>

438
00:17:46.761 --> 00:17:49.010
<v Speaker 3>to the guy that's behind the counter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you know?</v>

439
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Times I've talked to people</v>

440
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.410
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you go to a place that sells car</v>

441
00:17:52.411 --> 00:17:53.720
<v Speaker 1>parts or something like that and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>

442
00:17:53.721 --> 00:17:56.670
<v Speaker 1>you got a question and he says something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's totally wrong.</v>

443
00:17:56.671 --> 00:17:57.180
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

444
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.180
<v Speaker 1>I know that's not right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't know that and how the</v>

445
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:01.840
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know where this goes or,</v>

446
00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to be someone who's like</v>

447
00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 1>deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply involved in the product to be</v>

448
00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:09.300
<v Speaker 1>able to explain it to someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes obsessed.</v>

449
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone has like,</v>

450
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.200
<v Speaker 1>like your packs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you guys engineer the carbon</v>

451
00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:16.230
<v Speaker 1>frame your packs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I spent like fucking hour and a</v>

452
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.900
<v Speaker 1>half the other night watching videos of</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you guys make pacts and Nicole.</v>

453
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing he said right off the</v>

454
00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:23.340
<v Speaker 1>bat is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to pull the curtain back.</v>

455
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell everybody what</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has been afraid to tell</v>

456
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:27.470
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

457
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:30.240
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you educate the person to know what</v>

458
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:32.520
<v Speaker 1>they're looking at and you're building</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best stuff,</v>

459
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.980
<v Speaker 1>they'll end up back here and so he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

460
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 1>no one had ever said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what fabrics we're using.</v>

461
00:18:37.711 --> 00:18:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Here's where we're getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's where our factory,</v>

462
00:18:39.421 --> 00:18:40.980
<v Speaker 1>here's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like competitors,</v>

463
00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:43.380
<v Speaker 1>like are people going to seal it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

464
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.060
<v Speaker 1>You build the best stuff and you sell it</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a good value for what you have to and</v>

465
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.300
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

466
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the whole transparency thing has been</v>

467
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.990
<v Speaker 2>incredible to watch and be in direct</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can communicate directly with</v>

468
00:18:54.991 --> 00:18:59.040
<v Speaker 2>your customers as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so fricking powerful and they love</v>

469
00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:02.010
<v Speaker 2>it and we're able to build so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust.</v>

470
00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:03.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started,</v>

471
00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:05.970
<v Speaker 2>I started blogging about Ku.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You 18 months before ever launched.</v>

472
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:07.860
<v Speaker 2>I talked about the fabrics and</v>
<v Speaker 2>materials,</v>

473
00:19:07.861 --> 00:19:10.050
<v Speaker 2>a factories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the process of building a company.</v>

474
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.940
<v Speaker 2>And I really did it just to keep my name</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with the next brand.</v>

475
00:19:14.941 --> 00:19:17.100
<v Speaker 2>As I left and transitioned out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sitka,</v>

476
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.640
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what it would create.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it created this massive following.</v>

477
00:19:20.641 --> 00:19:23.700
<v Speaker 2>People started engaging with me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking me questions and I was,</v>

478
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to their suggestions on products</v>

479
00:19:26.611 --> 00:19:30.480
<v Speaker 2>and educated them on what great fabrics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what great design was,</v>

480
00:19:30.481 --> 00:19:34.950
<v Speaker 2>and they just ate it up and the consumer</v>
<v Speaker 2>loves it.</v>

481
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.290
<v Speaker 2>The retailer wasn't given it to them any</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer.</v>

482
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:38.940
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the day,</v>

483
00:19:38.941 --> 00:19:40.800
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up working at an archery shop in</v>

484
00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:43.110
<v Speaker 2>orange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California from Bob Fromm is really,</v>

485
00:19:43.111 --> 00:19:46.080
<v Speaker 2>really amazing archery shop owner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was the guy,</v>

486
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you walked in and said,</v>

487
00:19:47.341 --> 00:19:48.031
<v Speaker 2>Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the latest,</v>

488
00:19:48.031 --> 00:19:49.980
<v Speaker 2>greatest stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he can tell you all about it.</v>

489
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.310
<v Speaker 2>You go to Cabela's now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you were saying,</v>

490
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.000
<v Speaker 2>the guy on the floor has no clue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The customer knows more than the,</v>

491
00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.430
<v Speaker 2>than the retailer now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

492
00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.060
<v Speaker 2>by taking with cu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would go on directly that customer,</v>

493
00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:05.820
<v Speaker 2>giving them all that information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving them the power to make the</v>

494
00:20:05.821 --> 00:20:08.580
<v Speaker 2>decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ate it up and then bail to be</v>

495
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.520
<v Speaker 2>involved them through this process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

496
00:20:11.521 --> 00:20:13.650
<v Speaker 2>they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just build a ton of trust with you.</v>

497
00:20:13.651 --> 00:20:15.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like they understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they understand the brand,</v>

498
00:20:15.421 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 2>they understand you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they understand how you think and why</v>

499
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:19.590
<v Speaker 2>you're making those decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they trust you.</v>

500
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.960
<v Speaker 2>And once you have the consumers trust</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't break it,</v>

501
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can really build a brand off of</v>

502
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:25.160
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

503
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy like me who loves to geek out on</v>

504
00:20:27.021 --> 00:20:29.240
<v Speaker 1>shit too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally obsessed with things.</v>

505
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can go and watch all these videos</v>

506
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.650
<v Speaker 1>and read all this stuff about all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different engineering that's involved in</v>

507
00:20:36.651 --> 00:20:38.620
<v Speaker 1>creating a product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I do that,</v>

508
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.240
<v Speaker 1>it gets people more excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think it's a brilliant move</v>

509
00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:43.820
<v Speaker 1>to blog about it in between the time of</v>
<v Speaker 1>building the company,</v>

510
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.750
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I look back now and it's like</v>

511
00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:47.890
<v Speaker 2>ahead of blueprint on how to a company</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

512
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.130
<v Speaker 2>When we did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look back and read the blog posts and</v>

513
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.660
<v Speaker 2>I looked and I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

514
00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:55.270
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I actually did that</v>
<v Speaker 2>without really knowing I was doing.</v>

515
00:20:55.271 --> 00:20:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Cause it seems like an execute it so</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly.</v>

516
00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.440
<v Speaker 2>And I was just following my gut and</v>
<v Speaker 2>interacting with,</v>

517
00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:01.390
<v Speaker 2>with the customers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

518
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:04.210
<v Speaker 2>it was so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so powerful and such a big thing because</v>

519
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.110
<v Speaker 2>as I built this business model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the first of its kind in this</v>

520
00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:11.110
<v Speaker 2>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even the outdoor market people told</v>

521
00:21:11.111 --> 00:21:12.250
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool idea,</v>

522
00:21:12.251 --> 00:21:15.820
<v Speaker 2>but how are they going to find you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are they trust you to buy your</v>

523
00:21:15.821 --> 00:21:17.800
<v Speaker 2>product to begin with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to get customers</v>

524
00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:21.430
<v Speaker 2>before soon enough before so you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>go a business and run out of money?</v>

525
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Because so many companies will go create</v>
<v Speaker 2>a website launch and no one knows about</v>

526
00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:27.120
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

527
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Well how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you create that interest in</v>

528
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:30.140
<v Speaker 2>advance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

529
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 2>and create the demand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can spend a ton of money.</v>

530
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:36.430
<v Speaker 2>You look at like a warby parker or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hairy shave or dollar shave club,</v>

531
00:21:36.431 --> 00:21:40.690
<v Speaker 2>will they spend more money than they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing in and they're burning cash?</v>

532
00:21:40.691 --> 00:21:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Like it's going out of style to create</v>
<v Speaker 2>demand through high levels of marketing</v>

533
00:21:44.891 --> 00:21:46.030
<v Speaker 2>that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very expensive.</v>

534
00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:48.330
<v Speaker 2>Or you can do it like we didn't educate</v>
<v Speaker 2>the customer and,</v>

535
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 2>and be transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build trust in advance and then launch.</v>

536
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.460
<v Speaker 2>And then you've got your best sales</v>
<v Speaker 2>force in the world,</v>

537
00:21:54.461 --> 00:21:56.980
<v Speaker 2>which is your customer base because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand everything about your</v>

538
00:21:56.981 --> 00:21:59.200
<v Speaker 2>brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys have this advantage in that</v>

539
00:21:59.201 --> 00:22:02.680
<v Speaker 2>hunting w because it's such a difficult</v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuit because it's sort of gets in</v>

540
00:22:02.681 --> 00:22:04.990
<v Speaker 2>your DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you become obsessed with it.</v>

541
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.230
<v Speaker 2>And when you become obsessed with it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find a company that's also obsessed</v>

542
00:22:08.231 --> 00:22:09.940
<v Speaker 2>with making the very best shape</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>

543
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:13.510
<v Speaker 2>and then you guys geek out to such a</v>
<v Speaker 2>high level on the videos and on the</v>

544
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.400
<v Speaker 2>these descriptions of what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>making,</v>

545
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.150
<v Speaker 2>then then these obsessed people become</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with what you're doing.</v>

546
00:22:19.151 --> 00:22:19.691
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

547
00:22:19.691 --> 00:22:21.790
<v Speaker 2>well if I'm going to do this right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to do this this way.</v>

548
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.500
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

549
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.860
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's great.</v>

550
00:22:24.861 --> 00:22:28.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people we meet and hunters we meet in</v>

551
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.820
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a hunting camp or traveling.</v>

552
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing to me how much they know</v>

553
00:22:33.641 --> 00:22:36.010
<v Speaker 2>about a product and how much to know</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the brand.</v>

554
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:37.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

555
00:22:37.691 --> 00:22:42.280
<v Speaker 2>they geek out on it and eat all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>little details up and which I love</v>

556
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.820
<v Speaker 2>because that's what I geek out on when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm searching for these amazing fabrics</v>

557
00:22:45.821 --> 00:22:47.530
<v Speaker 2>and learning about new technologies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they share it.</v>

558
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 2>These people eat it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love it.</v>

559
00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Well it's really a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sort of a master class in how to do</v>

560
00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:57.190
<v Speaker 2>things the right way to foul passion and</v>
<v Speaker 2>being obsessed with something but doing</v>

561
00:22:57.191 --> 00:23:00.010
<v Speaker 2>it to the utmost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you do that then the word</v>

562
00:23:00.011 --> 00:23:01.150
<v Speaker 2>gets out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the word gets out,</v>

563
00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:02.950
<v Speaker 2>people talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

564
00:23:02.951 --> 00:23:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I found out about you guys through word</v>
<v Speaker 2>of mouth completely.</v>

565
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Well if you're actually doing it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like the customers really see</v>

566
00:23:09.041 --> 00:23:09.581
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

567
00:23:09.581 --> 00:23:12.790
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one else that's running a company.</v>

568
00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:13.510
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

569
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple haunts every year.</v>

570
00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.910
<v Speaker 2>Big study like believes in what he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

571
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.600
<v Speaker 2>what we're building and takes it to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>places that the are at.</v>

572
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Worst place our customers could ever go</v>
<v Speaker 2>and use it and people respect that they</v>

573
00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:27.170
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like that.</v>

574
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I wanna do,</v>

575

<v Speaker 2>he's done it to we,</v>

577
00:23:32.141 --> 00:23:32.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

578
00:23:32.501 --> 00:23:34.120
<v Speaker 2>we've used that stuff in those places.</v>

579
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.490
<v Speaker 2>What was it your blog that I read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

580
00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:40.480
<v Speaker 2>which blog was it where you guys were</v>
<v Speaker 2>sucking water out of the top of a rock?</v>

581
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.760
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the blogs for your</v>
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

582
00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 2>One of the early on blogs you guys went</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a hunt and uh,</v>

583
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.530
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were just talking in depth about all</v>

584
00:23:48.531 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Speaker 2>the different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who,</v>

585
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:51.090
<v Speaker 2>who was a wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was all cool.</v>

586
00:23:51.091 --> 00:23:53.510
<v Speaker 2>You stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking in depth about testing</v>

587
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:56.600
<v Speaker 2>out the products on these like really</v>
<v Speaker 2>remote back country hunts.</v>

588
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.411
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

589
00:23:57.411 --> 00:24:00.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's how we figured out the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shortcomings of our product.</v>

590
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:05.060
<v Speaker 2>You can look at all the laboratory data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look at all the test results of,</v>

591
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.870
<v Speaker 2>of what that's getting back to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you really don't know until you put</v>

592
00:24:08.871 --> 00:24:12.230
<v Speaker 2>it in the conditions that we put it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've like Toray who is my main</v>

593
00:24:12.231 --> 00:24:13.160
<v Speaker 2>fabric supplier.</v>

594
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:15.430
<v Speaker 2>This is the most innovative jap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they are the,</v>

595
00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.430
<v Speaker 2>the bomb as far as technical fabrics go</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

596
00:24:18.431 --> 00:24:23.270
<v Speaker 2>is Japanese the Japanese by culture</v>
<v Speaker 2>build the best fabrics in the world?</v>

597
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.280
<v Speaker 2>What do they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they putting in them?</v>

598
00:24:25.281 --> 00:24:27.260
<v Speaker 2>Cause like you guys use a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>synthetics,</v>

599
00:24:27.261 --> 00:24:28.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>

600
00:24:28.101 --> 00:24:31.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so their quality standards in Japan are</v>

601
00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:35.450
<v Speaker 2>much higher than anywhere else in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and they have a really high</v>

602
00:24:35.451 --> 00:24:38.930
<v Speaker 2>quality standard of the raw material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they have a really high quality</v>

603
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:43.670
<v Speaker 2>standard of the actual yarn and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've figured out how to make their</v>

604
00:24:43.671 --> 00:24:45.800
<v Speaker 2>yard stretch and recover with no</v>
<v Speaker 2>elastic.</v>

605
00:24:45.801 --> 00:24:49.820
<v Speaker 2>It's why our stuff so light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because of that process and because</v>

606
00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:51.860
<v Speaker 2>of their high quality standards are</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly expensive.</v>

607
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Japanese just by their,</v>

608
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.870
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their nature and their culture,</v>

609
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.390
<v Speaker 2>they don't do things that cut corners.</v>

610
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.960
<v Speaker 2>You look at the building of a Samurai</v>
<v Speaker 2>sword is a great example.</v>

611
00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:05.570
<v Speaker 2>There is a lot easier ways to build a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sword that a Samurai does.</v>

612
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.030
<v Speaker 2>The Samurai sword is built.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it takes a lot of time.</v>

613
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.810
<v Speaker 2>A lot of patients and it's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got one over there from 15,</v>

614
00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:13.550
<v Speaker 2>11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know it right?</v>

615
00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one sitting on the jam.</v>

616
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Real one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the way the Japanese do things and</v>

617
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.630
<v Speaker 2>it's the same way of why they produce</v>
<v Speaker 2>such amazing fabrics and materials and</v>

618
00:25:20.631 --> 00:25:23.300
<v Speaker 2>they're continuously pushing the bar as</v>
<v Speaker 2>far as innovation,</v>

619
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:25.220
<v Speaker 2>reducing weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a partner for us.</v>

620
00:25:25.221 --> 00:25:28.570
<v Speaker 2>That's just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found Toray well before I started q</v>

621
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.830
<v Speaker 2>you I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to build a Tory product line</v>

622
00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:33.050
<v Speaker 2>with Sitka and it was just price</v>
<v Speaker 2>prohibitive.</v>

623
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.340
<v Speaker 2>I took it to a couple of buyers at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cabela's,</v>

624
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when at shields sports and they said</v>

625
00:25:37.671 --> 00:25:39.350
<v Speaker 2>beautiful way too expensive.</v>

626
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.800
<v Speaker 2>So what are they doing to make this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff so light?</v>

627
00:25:42.801 --> 00:25:47.270
<v Speaker 2>And like it stretches a little bit in it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it snaps back,</v>

628
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's very light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they have a patent on how they</v>

629
00:25:49.971 --> 00:25:53.330
<v Speaker 2>make the yard is called Pram flex yarn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look under a microscope,</v>

630
00:25:53.331 --> 00:25:55.400
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a spring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

631
00:25:55.401 --> 00:25:58.880
<v Speaker 2>And so it can stretch out and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>recover without any elastic.</v>

632
00:25:58.881 --> 00:26:02.900
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else has to put spandex or</v>
<v Speaker 2>elastic or Lycra in their fabrics and</v>

633
00:26:02.901 --> 00:26:06.980
<v Speaker 2>lastic super heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It holds moisture and it's also,</v>

634
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with stretches and doesn't really</v>

635
00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:09.680
<v Speaker 2>recover until you wash it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again.</v>

636
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:11.810
<v Speaker 2>If you were a PA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a stretch pair of pants with a lot of</v>

637
00:26:11.811 --> 00:26:13.850
<v Speaker 2>lasted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can kind of saggy after a period of</v>

638
00:26:13.851 --> 00:26:16.700
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You notice with ours they'll fit the</v>

639
00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:20.390
<v Speaker 2>exact same way on day 10 as they did on</v>
<v Speaker 2>day one because of their fabric,</v>

640
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.940
<v Speaker 2>because of how they make the year on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stretches recover that last.</v>

641
00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.780
<v Speaker 2>So why are they making this fabric too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like who are these crazy people</v>

642
00:26:26.781 --> 00:26:29.780
<v Speaker 2>that are out there like super</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering fabric,</v>

643
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.590
<v Speaker 2>so Japanese and they'll sell it into</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese market.</v>

644
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:36.620
<v Speaker 2>They'll pay for performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their pricing on their performance.</v>

645
00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Apparel is much higher in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the European market as well for their</v>

646
00:26:40.041 --> 00:26:43.280
<v Speaker 2>climbing industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of the ski brands run their,</v>

647
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.910
<v Speaker 2>their uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fabrics as well.</v>

648
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

649
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:49.740
<v Speaker 2>nobody's really introduced their product</v>
<v Speaker 2>line like we have the United States</v>

650
00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:52.240
<v Speaker 2>cause it's been cost prohibitive to up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Teleco,</v>

651
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.310
<v Speaker 2>you business model came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just decided to essentially the</v>

652
00:26:56.311 --> 00:26:59.730
<v Speaker 2>same thing that you guys are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just figure out what is the best way to</v>

653
00:26:59.731 --> 00:27:00.900
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how they do it.</v>

654
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there I am,</v>

655
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.330
<v Speaker 2>Tory has ended or as a company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a Japanese conglomerate,</v>

656
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.610
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty typical of Japanese</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies and their,</v>

657
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.640
<v Speaker 2>their base,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the start of their company was</v>

658
00:27:11.641 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 2>chemistry.</v>

659
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.360
<v Speaker 2>So there are chemistry based company</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes chemicals and make carbon</v>

660
00:27:15.361 --> 00:27:18.720
<v Speaker 2>fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's chemistry that starts of with</v>

661
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:23.750
<v Speaker 2>everything they do and understanding how</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is produced and made and it's</v>

662
00:27:23.911 --> 00:27:27.510
<v Speaker 2>that foundation allows them to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to put out these amazing innovations to</v>

663
00:27:27.511 --> 00:27:30.180
<v Speaker 2>figure out nanotechnology and how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>waterproof a down feather,</v>

664
00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:33.870
<v Speaker 2>how to make membranes that brief two and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a half times that of Gortex and still</v>

665
00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:38.130
<v Speaker 2>stretch and recover in a more durable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that foundation of who Tory is,</v>

666
00:27:38.131 --> 00:27:42.720
<v Speaker 2>is a chemistry company that allows them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to push these innovations out and then</v>

667
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:47.340
<v Speaker 2>you add in the Japanese culture of</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfection and making things correct and</v>

668
00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:51.060
<v Speaker 2>having processes that continue to</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce high quality products and</v>

669
00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:55.470
<v Speaker 2>materials over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why Toray is so fricking</v>

670
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.460
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dork out over shit like,</v>

671
00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:01.050
<v Speaker 2>oh it's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just love when someone's trying to</v>

672
00:28:01.051 --> 00:28:05.490
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to engineer something</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the very finest edge they do.</v>

673
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.950
<v Speaker 2>And then what's great about them is</v>
<v Speaker 2>always pushing.</v>

674
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.430
<v Speaker 2>And so they're coming to us with new</v>
<v Speaker 2>fabric innovations,</v>

675
00:28:11.431 --> 00:28:16.431
<v Speaker 2>new technologies and innovation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're able to find their limits because</v>

676
00:28:16.441 --> 00:28:18.000
<v Speaker 2>of our customers and what they use it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

677
00:28:18.001 --> 00:28:20.280
<v Speaker 2>And I'm able to go back to their</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineers now cause I've developed a</v>

678
00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:23.460
<v Speaker 2>really big relationship with them where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are now their largest customer in</v>

679
00:28:23.461 --> 00:28:26.610
<v Speaker 2>the world and worked directly with their</v>
<v Speaker 2>team and say,</v>

680
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:30.300
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your membrane works great except for</v>

681
00:28:30.301 --> 00:28:32.130
<v Speaker 2>these certain situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

682
00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:35.310
<v Speaker 2>they go and they try to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to run it by that and they will.</v>

683
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they'll commit themselves to</v>

684
00:28:37.081 --> 00:28:40.790
<v Speaker 2>fixing issues that we'll find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The laboratory tests say they shouldn't</v>

685
00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:42.420
<v Speaker 2>ever fail and we'll find the limits of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

686
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:43.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily Brendan,</v>

687
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:44.700
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our guides,</v>

688
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.800
<v Speaker 2>they're spending 200 250 days of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>life every year in the mountains.</v>

689
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.180
<v Speaker 2>They'll come back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

690
00:28:51.181 --> 00:28:54.840
<v Speaker 2>guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this happened in this situation as rare</v>

691
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.850
<v Speaker 2>but lets us go back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

692
00:28:56.851 --> 00:28:58.800
<v Speaker 2>their development team and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

693
00:28:58.801 --> 00:29:01.770
<v Speaker 2>we found limits on this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there they listen and they go back</v>

694
00:29:01.771 --> 00:29:04.770
<v Speaker 2>and try to re engineer it to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to push the bar further.</v>

695
00:29:04.771 --> 00:29:06.810
<v Speaker 2>So those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those failures don't have,</v>

696
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.050
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to on a podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>

697
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.110
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about this new</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering that you're doing on your</v>

698
00:29:13.111 --> 00:29:15.870
<v Speaker 2>packs and how you're testing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like when you,</v>

699
00:29:15.871 --> 00:29:18.900
<v Speaker 2>when you have a new product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll say if you create a new pack or</v>

700
00:29:18.901 --> 00:29:21.810
<v Speaker 2>something like that and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you bring it to market,</v>

701
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.390
<v Speaker 2>do you get it to guides?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have them tested?</v>

702
00:29:24.391 --> 00:29:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Do you test it yourself exclusively?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

703
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.510
<v Speaker 2>so it starts as a process in house and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll put it through a certain tests</v>

704
00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.410
<v Speaker 2>depending on the product.</v>

705
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Like the pack new pack frame we just</v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced today earlier.</v>

706
00:29:34.071 --> 00:29:35.940
<v Speaker 2>It could you live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he just happened to see</v>

707
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.920
<v Speaker 2>my live presentation for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flight down here.</v>

708
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>

709
00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 2>you do a live presentation like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>product and you did that today.</v>

710
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like a keynote thing like jobs</v>

711
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:45.340
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

712
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.500
<v Speaker 2>I was doing that with hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody,</v>

713
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.770
<v Speaker 2>you guys are savages not doing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited about this.</v>

714
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Not It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not doing it well.</v>

715
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.170
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

716
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.660
<v Speaker 2>you have this product launch and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what did you,</v>

717
00:29:58.661 --> 00:29:59.680
<v Speaker 2>what did you launch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

718
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we introduced a new carbon fiber</v>

719
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:04.270
<v Speaker 2>technology that just came out on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>market a couple of years ago.</v>

720
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Introduced as far as ability to start</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing product with a new fiber</v>

721
00:30:08.531 --> 00:30:10.540
<v Speaker 2>technology called spread tow carbon</v>
<v Speaker 2>fiber.</v>

722
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:12.760
<v Speaker 2>You'll love this because you keep you</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and stuff like this.</v>

723
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:16.860
<v Speaker 2>So carbon fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditionally the fibers are putting the</v>

724
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:17.770
<v Speaker 2>yarn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

725
00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:19.840
<v Speaker 2>So they take each individual carbon</v>
<v Speaker 2>fiber,</v>

726
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:23.650
<v Speaker 2>group them together and make a yarn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those yarns are then woven into fabric.</v>

727
00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.290
<v Speaker 2>It's what you see of typical carbon</v>
<v Speaker 2>fiber look,</v>

728
00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:27.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The woven,</v>

729
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the web and look you see on carbon fiber</v>

730
00:30:29.711 --> 00:30:32.200
<v Speaker 2>what spread toe is instead of round</v>
<v Speaker 2>fibers.</v>

731
00:30:32.201 --> 00:30:34.510
<v Speaker 2>They've figured out that if you flatten</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fibers out,</v>

732
00:30:34.511 --> 00:30:37.900
<v Speaker 2>so instead of being round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're flat and instead of weaving</v>

733
00:30:37.901 --> 00:30:39.970
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lay them next to each other and</v>

734
00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:43.240
<v Speaker 2>then so they run so lines across it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you can see in our new frame.</v>

735
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.190
<v Speaker 2>And by doing so when you mold it into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>product,</v>

736
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.140
<v Speaker 2>because that fiber is now completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>flat and it's running the length of the,</v>

737
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.560
<v Speaker 2>of the product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much stiffer and stronger than if</v>

738
00:30:56.561 --> 00:31:01.390
<v Speaker 2>you weave it in a has the fiber has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go up and over other fibers is not as</v>

739
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:03.340
<v Speaker 2>stiff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as strong in the performance level.</v>

740
00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:06.910
<v Speaker 2>You give up quite a bit compared to</v>
<v Speaker 2>spread to spread toes,</v>

741
00:31:06.911 --> 00:31:10.300
<v Speaker 2>all directional fibers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what we've done in our frame is</v>

742
00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:14.890
<v Speaker 2>we now can determine exactly how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>fibers run from the top of the frame to</v>

743
00:31:14.891 --> 00:31:16.630
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we,</v>

744
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:21.850
<v Speaker 2>the fibers of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then lay in on a 45 how much</v>

745
00:31:23.801 --> 00:31:27.040
<v Speaker 2>stiffness we want and flex we want on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the horizontal axis.</v>

746
00:31:27.041 --> 00:31:29.410
<v Speaker 2>So do you want our packs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll,</v>

747
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.130
<v Speaker 2>you'll notice that it carries a load</v>
<v Speaker 2>really well because the vertical</v>

748
00:31:33.131 --> 00:31:34.870
<v Speaker 2>stiffness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also comfortable like an</v>

749
00:31:34.871 --> 00:31:39.640
<v Speaker 2>internal pack because of how much fiber</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have running on the horizontal access</v>

750
00:31:39.641 --> 00:31:42.490
<v Speaker 2>that controls that flex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you want to have a certain amount of</v>

751
00:31:42.491 --> 00:31:43.660
<v Speaker 2>flex?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

752
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you got to figure out what that</v>

753
00:31:46.421 --> 00:31:48.460
<v Speaker 2>amount is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way to figure that out is by</v>

754
00:31:48.461 --> 00:31:51.250
<v Speaker 2>testing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went through 18 versions of our frame</v>

755
00:31:51.251 --> 00:31:54.400
<v Speaker 2>to get to where the formula is that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>now and re reintroduce today.</v>

756
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.320
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who does that?</v>

757
00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.710
<v Speaker 2>I do work fiber engineers and with our</v>
<v Speaker 2>development team,</v>

758
00:31:59.711 --> 00:32:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Sean and in our office does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there any other companies is going</v>

759
00:32:03.311 --> 00:32:06.760
<v Speaker 2>through 18 different versions of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbon fiber frame in order to figure</v>

760
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.260
<v Speaker 2>the only one in the world that produces</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

761
00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:12.070
<v Speaker 2>So it's probably just us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a patent on our frame design.</v>

762
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.210
<v Speaker 2>I know what carbon fiber is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what carbon fiber is.</v>

763
00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:18.700
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my car has,</v>

764
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.770
<v Speaker 2>oh look at this Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

765
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.630
<v Speaker 2>On the ball to killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's always on the ball.</v>

766
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a cloth.</v>

767
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's soft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pliable.</v>

768
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does it,</v>

769
00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:32.020
<v Speaker 2>because I have a porsche nine 11 gt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three Rs that has a carbon fiber rear</v>

770
00:32:32.021 --> 00:32:33.400
<v Speaker 2>wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm also like,</v>

771
00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:35.230
<v Speaker 2>it looks bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what the fuck is that?</v>

772
00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Stay down as a fiber and then you put it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to clock in it.</v>

773
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 2>And that's what connects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the epoxy,</v>

774
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Speaker 2>so it starts out as a co,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a carbon cloth.</v>

775
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.420
<v Speaker 2>It is pure cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could feel it,</v>

776
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.930
<v Speaker 2>flexes moves just like the cloth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

777
00:32:47.931 --> 00:32:50.120
<v Speaker 2>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what it looks as at fabric.</v>

778
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:53.600
<v Speaker 2>So that spread toe there in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bi-directional format.</v>

779
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.820
<v Speaker 2>And then from there you turn that</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another into this really hard</v>

780
00:32:58.821 --> 00:33:03.821
<v Speaker 2>stuff with a heat activated resin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you saw,</v>

781
00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.710
<v Speaker 2>if you go back to the mold with a frame</v>
<v Speaker 2>where lane in there,</v>

782
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

783
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.350
<v Speaker 2>So we're laying that into a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a mold.</v>

784
00:33:11.351 --> 00:33:13.880
<v Speaker 2>So we have a bottom molds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aluminum cut and a top mold.</v>

785
00:33:13.881 --> 00:33:17.150
<v Speaker 2>And we laid that fiber in and the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing is applying the resin.</v>

786
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.580
<v Speaker 2>And then we'll put the top mold on top.</v>

787
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:21.900
<v Speaker 2>And then we add a ton of pressure for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

788
00:33:21.901 --> 00:33:25.730
<v Speaker 2>How many thousands of pounds of pressure</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets put on top of it and add heat and</v>

789
00:33:25.731 --> 00:33:29.390
<v Speaker 2>time and over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it takes in that little over an</v>

790
00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:33.500
<v Speaker 2>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will cure that mold or that that</v>

791
00:33:33.501 --> 00:33:36.770
<v Speaker 2>resin into a actual part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that becomes our frame.</v>

792
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:42.460
<v Speaker 2>And one is the advantage of that over</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say any other very stiff or durable</v>

793
00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.110
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's half the weight of aluminum.</v>

794
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:49.730
<v Speaker 2>It's twice as strong as steel and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>by twice as strongest deal.</v>

795
00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:53.960
<v Speaker 2>It is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing material and one and then</v>

796
00:33:53.961 --> 00:33:58.340
<v Speaker 2>also how we engineer the mold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a big part of the engineering</v>

797
00:33:58.341 --> 00:34:02.600
<v Speaker 2>process of this is understanding how far</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart you separate the fibers create</v>

798
00:34:02.601 --> 00:34:06.230
<v Speaker 2>stiffness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have foam in between the carbon</v>

799
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:09.410
<v Speaker 2>fibers and them center portion of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>frame that that full uh,</v>

800
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:12.110
<v Speaker 2>that phone crates and what what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>called modulates,</v>

801
00:34:12.111 --> 00:34:14.540
<v Speaker 2>which is a separation of the fibers.</v>

802
00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.450
<v Speaker 2>And that modulates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creates the overall stiffness within the</v>

803
00:34:17.451 --> 00:34:21.050
<v Speaker 2>center portion of our frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then how much of that we have within</v>

804
00:34:21.051 --> 00:34:23.270
<v Speaker 2>the frame determines how much flex</v>
<v Speaker 2>stiffness.</v>

805
00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.150
<v Speaker 2>And then also where we're putting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fibers and how many,</v>

806
00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.040
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The weak point of carbon is the epoxy,</v>

807
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:32.450
<v Speaker 2>the carbons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the strongest part.</v>

808
00:34:32.451 --> 00:34:35.610
<v Speaker 2>And so the new spread toe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it does is it,</v>

809
00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.400
<v Speaker 2>it makes it tighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smaller,</v>

810
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:38.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less.</v>

811
00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Less epoxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

812
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:43.220
<v Speaker 2>And so when we got out spread toe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which who does introduced for no weight</v>

813
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:45.020
<v Speaker 2>penalty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we now have a frame that's five times</v>

814
00:34:45.021 --> 00:34:47.180
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger than what we had previous,</v>

815
00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:51.920
<v Speaker 2>which is still a really good performing</v>
<v Speaker 2>product and we just got five times</v>

816
00:34:51.921 --> 00:34:53.000
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane,</v>

817
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.240
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when,</v>

818
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:56.840
<v Speaker 2>when you say five times different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>

819
00:34:56.841 --> 00:34:59.840
<v Speaker 2>how do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a too stiff or is it not a</v>

820
00:34:59.841 --> 00:35:00.530
<v Speaker 2>stiffness issue?</v>

821
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:01.890
<v Speaker 2>It's a flex issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there,</v>

822
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.110
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a difference here?</v>

823
00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean there is and it's a challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

824
00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:09.980
<v Speaker 2>It's finding that perfect balance and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do that with carbon.</v>

825
00:35:09.981 --> 00:35:14.240
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that with a steel or</v>
<v Speaker 2>aluminum frame pack and you really can't</v>

826
00:35:14.241 --> 00:35:16.910
<v Speaker 2>do that with any other pack frame</v>
<v Speaker 2>design,</v>

827
00:35:16.911 --> 00:35:20.990
<v Speaker 2>which is usually some sort of plastic</v>
<v Speaker 2>sheeting with aluminum stays put in.</v>

828
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.300
<v Speaker 2>The flex is kind of there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can add more lumens stays,</v>

829
00:35:23.301 --> 00:35:28.080
<v Speaker 2>but then still is an aluminum stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the people who listen to this and</v>

830
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.620
<v Speaker 2>understand what's aluminum bar</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially.</v>

831
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:34.730
<v Speaker 2>And you can kind of mold in a curve or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever and it's sewn to a piece of</v>

832
00:35:34.731 --> 00:35:36.410
<v Speaker 2>plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoved down the back part of it.</v>

833
00:35:36.411 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Like an internal frame backpack</v>

834
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.250
<v Speaker 3>has some sort of support,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stiffness,</v>

835
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 3>stiffness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rigidity.</v>

836
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:46.200
<v Speaker 3>It's what will pull the weight off</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody's shoulders that it will help</v>

837
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.260
<v Speaker 3>carry that load versus just a Duffel bag</v>
<v Speaker 3>strapped to your back,</v>

838
00:35:49.261 --> 00:35:51.300
<v Speaker 3>which is uncomfortable as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's where the,</v>

839
00:35:51.301 --> 00:35:52.740
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the interesting aspect of the</v>

840
00:35:52.741 --> 00:35:54.780
<v Speaker 3>engineering comes in when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>packs because,</v>

841
00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same weight with a different pack</v>

842
00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.920
<v Speaker 3>feels different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally different.</v>

843
00:35:58.921 --> 00:36:01.050
<v Speaker 3>And that's something that I think a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people are not aware of.</v>

844
00:36:01.051 --> 00:36:01.920
<v Speaker 3>Like you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

845
00:36:01.921 --> 00:36:03.270
<v Speaker 3>she carrying a hundred pounds on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

846
00:36:03.271 --> 00:36:04.500
<v Speaker 3>You're carrying a hundred pounds on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

847
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.610
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

848
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.211
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

849
00:36:06.211 --> 00:36:08.670
<v Speaker 3>it's depended entirely upon the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ergonomics,</v>

850
00:36:08.671 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 3>how it sets on your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

851
00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:12.930
<v Speaker 3>And geometry of how that loads</v>
<v Speaker 3>transferred onto your back and the</v>

852
00:36:12.931 --> 00:36:13.541
<v Speaker 3>frame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

853
00:36:13.541 --> 00:36:15.780
<v Speaker 3>and balancing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot to it.</v>

854
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:17.880
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the past,</v>

855
00:36:17.881 --> 00:36:22.290
<v Speaker 3>before our frame came to market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you either had really stiff frames with</v>

856
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.240
<v Speaker 3>external frame packs and metal or</v>
<v Speaker 3>aluminum.</v>

857
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:28.490
<v Speaker 3>And then you have this internal frame</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was really comfortable until you</v>

858
00:36:28.491 --> 00:36:31.200
<v Speaker 3>had put weight in it and then it would</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be stiff Neth and it would end</v>

859
00:36:31.201 --> 00:36:34.680
<v Speaker 3>up putting a lot of pressure and weight</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your shoulders and your hips.</v>

860
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:37.590
<v Speaker 3>So how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you engineer that?</v>

861
00:36:37.591 --> 00:36:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to try it out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to like take one of these</v>

862
00:36:40.141 --> 00:36:42.690
<v Speaker 3>packs and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and wear it on a long back country hunt</v>

863
00:36:42.691 --> 00:36:43.201
<v Speaker 3>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

864
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:45.180
<v Speaker 3>here's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a little bit too much weight on my</v>

865
00:36:45.181 --> 00:36:46.890
<v Speaker 3>shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit too much weight on my hip</v>

866
00:36:46.891 --> 00:36:49.440
<v Speaker 3>or how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you discern?</v>

867
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:53.790
<v Speaker 3>That's essentially that I do a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>workouts with weight on my back and a</v>

868
00:36:53.791 --> 00:36:55.500
<v Speaker 3>pack on a treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

869
00:36:55.501 --> 00:36:57.930
<v Speaker 3>so I'm able,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd spend a ton of time in our packs</v>

870
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.230
<v Speaker 3>with various weights and we do that.</v>

871
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of guys in our office do as well</v>

872
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:05.250
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well as my uh,</v>

873
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.530
<v Speaker 3>my pack developer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shawn and Brendan.</v>

874
00:37:07.531 --> 00:37:09.330
<v Speaker 3>And then we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once we feel like we're really close,</v>

875
00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:14.331
<v Speaker 3>we then ship them out to Brendan's guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of guides and say test it for</v>

876
00:37:14.411 --> 00:37:17.160
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But through your world and what you're</v>

877
00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:18.930
<v Speaker 3>using it for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of the challenges we have</v>

878
00:37:18.931 --> 00:37:21.600
<v Speaker 3>with our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with our industry and backpacks is this</v>

879
00:37:21.601 --> 00:37:24.840
<v Speaker 3>huge as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this huge swing of weight.</v>

880
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause once we get something down we've</v>

881
00:37:27.481 --> 00:37:29.610
<v Speaker 3>got to get all that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to go from maybe packing</v>

882
00:37:29.611 --> 00:37:33.030
<v Speaker 3>them with 50 or 60 pound back to all</v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden now you've got 100 plus pound</v>

883
00:37:33.031 --> 00:37:36.300
<v Speaker 3>load and need to manage that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do you get a pack that can do</v>

884
00:37:36.301 --> 00:37:38.640
<v Speaker 3>both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be comfortable with lighter weights and</v>

885
00:37:38.641 --> 00:37:41.160
<v Speaker 3>still have the ability to carry heavy</v>
<v Speaker 3>weights?</v>

886
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.940
<v Speaker 3>It's an engineering problem and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>also an engineering problem that's</v>

887
00:37:44.941 --> 00:37:48.870
<v Speaker 3>handled to a bunch of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some people pack it inside the bag,</v>

888
00:37:48.871 --> 00:37:51.540
<v Speaker 3>some people the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pack separates from the frame.</v>

889
00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:54.270
<v Speaker 3>You pack the meat to your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then put the pack,</v>

890
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.910
<v Speaker 3>the rest of the pack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strap that down on top of the frame.</v>

891
00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.810
<v Speaker 3>How do you decide how to handle that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just trial and error as well.</v>

892
00:37:59.811 --> 00:38:01.080
<v Speaker 3>You want the weight closest to your</v>
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

893
00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:05.970
<v Speaker 3>you can get the better it is and it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the closest you can get it like flatter</v>

894
00:38:05.971 --> 00:38:08.130
<v Speaker 3>to your back as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't,</v>

895
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.260
<v Speaker 3>you don't want it like bulging out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

896
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.930
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have a large,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

897
00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.230
<v Speaker 3>If you have a hundred pounds and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting in a two foot square,</v>

898
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:19.470
<v Speaker 3>the lower part of your back that's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>nearly as good as like flattened out to</v>

899
00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:21.560
<v Speaker 3>six inches and going over the entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>section,</v>

900
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:24.300
<v Speaker 3>you're going to spread that out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and down the frame as close to the</v>

901
00:38:24.301 --> 00:38:26.550
<v Speaker 3>frame of your back as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how,</v>

902
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.410
<v Speaker 3>where do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do you make it sit on your</v>

903
00:38:28.411 --> 00:38:30.930
<v Speaker 3>shoulders?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are you strapping it in to make sure</v>

904
00:38:30.931 --> 00:38:34.140
<v Speaker 3>that it's in the right place or you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to carry the majority of the route with</v>

905
00:38:34.141 --> 00:38:35.530
<v Speaker 3>your hips?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

906
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean you</v>

907
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.700
<v Speaker 2>start at the waist to put it all in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then shoulder straps,</v>

908
00:38:39.701 --> 00:38:41.410
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of stuff and stand up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your,</v>

909
00:38:41.411 --> 00:38:43.450
<v Speaker 2>your load lifters and all the way up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean you want it,</v>

910
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's individual thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how how it fits.</v>

911
00:38:46.271 --> 00:38:48.610
<v Speaker 2>But you want to start with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean your hips or your strongest,</v>

912
00:38:48.611 --> 00:38:49.690
<v Speaker 2>your center of gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

913
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.240
<v Speaker 2>that's where you want the majority of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weight to be carried as close as you</v>

914
00:38:52.241 --> 00:38:54.040
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is all trial and error stuff</v>

915
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:56.590
<v Speaker 2>that's been done through mountaineering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Throw these different guys that are</v>

916
00:38:56.591 --> 00:39:00.010
<v Speaker 2>going on these long backpack hikes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah it is.</v>

917
00:39:00.011 --> 00:39:01.360
<v Speaker 2>And then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fit.</v>

918
00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.820
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's critical that you have the</v>

919
00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:06.750
<v Speaker 2>pack that fits correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people have a pack that isn't set</v>

920
00:39:06.751 --> 00:39:11.290
<v Speaker 2>up correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we found that with our pacs are</v>

921
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:14.200
<v Speaker 2>really easy to adjust shoulder straps so</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can get a perfect fit for each</v>

922
00:39:14.201 --> 00:39:14.620
<v Speaker 2>customer.</v>

923
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:18.610
<v Speaker 2>And we put an instructional video out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there of making sure the geometry from</v>

924
00:39:18.611 --> 00:39:21.790
<v Speaker 2>your load lifters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are the straps that come off the</v>

925
00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:24.700
<v Speaker 2>top of the pack down to your shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 2>straps that geometry has to,</v>

926
00:39:24.701 --> 00:39:28.330
<v Speaker 2>is critical that it's perfect and it has</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be at a 45 degree angle that will</v>

927
00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:31.780
<v Speaker 2>help take that load off your shoulders</v>
<v Speaker 2>and transfer to your hips and help you</v>

928
00:39:31.781 --> 00:39:33.850
<v Speaker 2>manage that weight comfortably over a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long period of time.</v>

929
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.690
<v Speaker 2>So you need like geometry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need like you need like a triangle</v>

930
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.420
<v Speaker 2>set up to make sure it's where this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the whole bubble thing doesn't</v>

931
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Speaker 2>come in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

932
00:39:42.341 --> 00:39:45.850
<v Speaker 2>That's why there's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it starts at mathematics with the</v>

933
00:39:45.851 --> 00:39:50.851
<v Speaker 2>frame and designs and cad and CNC</v>
<v Speaker 2>machines and all that and the math and</v>

934
00:39:51.281 --> 00:39:53.440
<v Speaker 2>all through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it goes all the way through and</v>

935
00:39:53.441 --> 00:39:54.680
<v Speaker 2>you build it and then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

936
00:39:54.681 --> 00:39:56.170
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it requires testing and,</v>

937
00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:57.700
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and taking it,</v>

938
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in real life settings and,</v>

939
00:39:59.571 --> 00:40:01.570
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people vary on what they like.</v>

940
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's some guys like to carry</v>
<v Speaker 2>see things a certain way.</v>

941
00:40:04.451 --> 00:40:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Some people like fit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

942
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.990
<v Speaker 2>some guys like their pack way up high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

943
00:40:07.991 --> 00:40:11.470
<v Speaker 2>I've fitted guys that like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can only know by,</v>

944
00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.090
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by testing it,</v>

945
00:40:13.091 --> 00:40:16.750
<v Speaker 2>by doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by carrying some weight and how many</v>

946
00:40:16.751 --> 00:40:20.290
<v Speaker 2>different products are you individually</v>
<v Speaker 2>overseeing and c.</v>

947
00:40:20.291 --> 00:40:20.931
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

948
00:40:20.931 --> 00:40:24.190
<v Speaker 2>that's the most daunting aspect of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you've got all this different</v>

949
00:40:24.191 --> 00:40:28.210
<v Speaker 2>shit going on at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on top of that you're doing a dozen</v>

950
00:40:28.211 --> 00:40:30.230
<v Speaker 2>hunts a year plus and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

951
00:40:30.231 --> 00:40:32.890
<v Speaker 2>you're out there in the field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how the fuck do you find the time</v>

952
00:40:32.891 --> 00:40:33.840
<v Speaker 2>to do all this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

953
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting when you,</v>

954
00:40:35.411 --> 00:40:38.160
<v Speaker 2>when you do something you love and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a huge passion for it.</v>

955
00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.480
<v Speaker 2>I never stopped working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I work second,</v>

956
00:40:40.481 --> 00:40:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I get up in the morning until the time I</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to bed.</v>

957
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:45.560
<v Speaker 2>If I'm not sitting in front of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer working on stuff specific for q</v>

958
00:40:45.561 --> 00:40:47.380
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about it and that's,</v>

959
00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:50.860
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel like it's a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I look back now and go,</v>

960
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.420
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a lot of work.</v>

961
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.140
<v Speaker 2>We found some amazing products.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

962
00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.760
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

963
00:40:57.761 --> 00:41:01.360
<v Speaker 2>it's a process and it's solving problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>through finding materials and</v>

964
00:41:01.361 --> 00:41:03.400
<v Speaker 2>technologies and the designs it solve</v>
<v Speaker 2>those problems.</v>

965
00:41:03.401 --> 00:41:07.180
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot to be solved and hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately it was a big gap from afar.</v>

966
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Brendan pull that sucker up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close a big gap from,</v>

967
00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the other industries are out</v>

968
00:41:12.461 --> 00:41:14.170
<v Speaker 2>there before Sitka and could use come</v>
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>

969
00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:17.740
<v Speaker 2>So there was a lot of work to do and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've done a lot to take from where</v>

970
00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:22.720
<v Speaker 2>hunting apparel and gear was back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>2004 to where it is today in 2016 is a</v>

971
00:41:22.721 --> 00:41:26.740
<v Speaker 2>massive change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not everything's as in depth as the</v>

972
00:41:26.741 --> 00:41:28.390
<v Speaker 2>pack all the way from start to finish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

973
00:41:28.391 --> 00:41:31.270
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you have great fit on</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and you have a new fabric.</v>

974
00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

975
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean how it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to get tested.</v>

976
00:41:33.741 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 2>You got to</v>

977
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.010
<v Speaker 3>see how you like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not like 18 models of,</v>

978
00:41:37.011 --> 00:41:38.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get a superior breathing,</v>

979
00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:41.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

980
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not all as in depth as added to.</v>

981
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:49.340
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of it's plugging in the right</v>
<v Speaker 3>product to the right fit and then you</v>

982
00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:50.810
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a winner right off the bat.</v>

983
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:51.900
<v Speaker 3>Well I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

984
00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.690
<v Speaker 3>what you were saying about the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

985
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:57.140
<v Speaker 3>this is also like how we were saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hunting isn't really a sport.</v>

986
00:41:57.141 --> 00:41:59.930
<v Speaker 3>Like it gets called a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of its own thing.</v>

987
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.170
<v Speaker 3>Work is sort of its own thing too</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can call it,</v>

988
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.720
<v Speaker 3>you can call it work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you love something,</v>

989
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.280
<v Speaker 3>it's not really work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like showing up at the garbage depo and,</v>

990
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:13.550
<v Speaker 3>or the garbage dump and picking up cans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>garbage.</v>

991
00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:16.850
<v Speaker 3>I guess you could love garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some,</v>

992
00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:19.700
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some guy out there screaming</v>

993
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:22.580
<v Speaker 3>kill it and garbage.</v>

994
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:23.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

995
00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.710
<v Speaker 3>When you find something that you become</v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with,</v>

996
00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:30.380
<v Speaker 3>that becomes a passion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a puzzle.</v>

997
00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:30.930
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

998
00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:33.560
<v Speaker 3>it's just like you're doing it again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a game all day,</v>

999
00:42:33.561 --> 00:42:36.560
<v Speaker 3>almost there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also in a lot of ways in art</v>

1000
00:42:36.561 --> 00:42:41.240
<v Speaker 3>forum did I tell you what brand building</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be as fascinating and it is an art</v>

1001
00:42:41.241 --> 00:42:43.700
<v Speaker 3>form and there's no science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no blueprint.</v>

1002
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:47.840
<v Speaker 3>This is how you build this brand and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's the most fascinating work</v>

1003
00:42:47.841 --> 00:42:51.170
<v Speaker 3>I've ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's truly figuring out a craft brand</v>

1004
00:42:51.171 --> 00:42:53.810
<v Speaker 3>building is a craft well and never</v>
<v Speaker 3>stops.</v>

1005
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.280
<v Speaker 3>You never stop learning from it every</v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1006
00:42:55.281 --> 00:42:56.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean you live it and breathe it every</v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1007
00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it reflects you guys.</v>

1008
00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:00.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've found interesting about this.</v>

1009
00:43:00.891 --> 00:43:04.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can kind of see when</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's someone like you that's at the</v>

1010
00:43:04.431 --> 00:43:08.270
<v Speaker 3>head of something like this and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>this driven focus guy,</v>

1011
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.000
<v Speaker 3>you kind of see that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see the,</v>

1012
00:43:11.001 --> 00:43:12.500
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual brand itself,</v>

1013
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.090
<v Speaker 3>it reflects you.</v>

1014
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.320
<v Speaker 3>So this idea of like it being work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really like a passion project.</v>

1015
00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:19.760
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It truly is.</v>

1016
00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.300
<v Speaker 3>Everything from the product to the brand</v>
<v Speaker 3>building to the videos,</v>

1017
00:43:23.301 --> 00:43:24.230
<v Speaker 3>to the imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1018
00:43:24.231 --> 00:43:29.231
<v Speaker 3>I've got my hands in everything and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>super particular about the way our image</v>

1019
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:31.340
<v Speaker 3>is presented to the marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to have it.</v>

1020
00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.050
<v Speaker 3>I can feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always tell people I can,</v>

1021
00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:34.970
<v Speaker 3>I can feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can taste it,</v>

1022
00:43:34.971 --> 00:43:37.280
<v Speaker 3>I can smell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything was cool.</v>

1023
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:41.720
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a one of the beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 3>things about having a very small center</v>

1024
00:43:41.721 --> 00:43:45.890
<v Speaker 3>of operation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you guys deciding how this goes</v>

1025
00:43:45.891 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to meet with a giant</v>

1026
00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:49.010
<v Speaker 3>board of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1027
00:43:49.011 --> 00:43:51.110
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not a public company.</v>

1028
00:43:51.111 --> 00:43:52.280
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to,</v>

1029
00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:54.740
<v Speaker 3>there's nobody there to water down the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheerios.</v>

1030
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.110
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean that it's not a democracy</v>
<v Speaker 3>down the cheerios?</v>

1031

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1043
00:44:22.101 --> 00:44:25.370
<v Speaker 3>as soon as I bring in outside capital or</v>
<v Speaker 3>profession professionals and look in the</v>

1044
00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:26.204
<v Speaker 3>business,</v>

<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does professional my</v>

1048
00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:32.941
<v Speaker 1>team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1049
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:33.751
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1050
00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:35.490
<v Speaker 1>you need a CFO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a cmo.</v>

1051
00:44:35.491 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 1>You need to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

00:44:36.421 --> 00:44:37.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm like for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for what?</v>

1053
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can slow down our process so we</v>

1054
00:44:40.681 --> 00:44:42.990
<v Speaker 1>can change the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's built a really special,</v>

1055
00:44:42.991 --> 00:44:45.390
<v Speaker 1>unique company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some bunch of other people give pieces</v>

1056
00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:49.020
<v Speaker 1>of the pie away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just such a broken traditional</v>

1057
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:53.240
<v Speaker 1>model as far as growing a business and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing it just the opposite to,</v>

1058
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:56.490
<v Speaker 1>same thing with podcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a broken model that's,</v>

1059
00:44:56.590 --> 00:45:00.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of podcasters today that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are joining in with these gigantic</v>

1060
00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:04.500
<v Speaker 1>networks and they think that being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of a network is like being on NBC</v>

1061
00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:07.350
<v Speaker 1>or being on CBS,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it used to be a big deal back in</v>

1062
00:45:07.351 --> 00:45:08.820
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were running,</v>

1063
00:45:08.821 --> 00:45:11.430
<v Speaker 1>doing a play and NBC came along and</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1064
00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.300
<v Speaker 1>we want to turn that play into a sitcom.</v>

1065
00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.940
<v Speaker 1>He be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fucking made it.</v>

1066
00:45:14.941 --> 00:45:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now if you have a successful podcast</v>

1067
00:45:19.171 --> 00:45:20.310
<v Speaker 1>and someone comes along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1068
00:45:20.311 --> 00:45:22.740
<v Speaker 1>we would love you to be a part of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic corporation.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're going to ruin everything.</v>

1071
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.380
<v Speaker 1>They can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will.</v>

1072

<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll tell you what you can't do.</v>

1074
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.650
<v Speaker 1>No more cussing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more cussing for short.</v>

<v Speaker 1>pick your,</v>

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.220

<v Speaker 1>your you're way too spaced out.</v>

1096
00:46:17.251 --> 00:46:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brendan's a perfect example.</v>

1097
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:21.990
<v Speaker 1>He freaking loves hunting and he lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>and breathes it.</v>

1098
00:46:21.991 --> 00:46:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Studies it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look where he is now.</v>

1099
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I met Brendan,</v>

1100
00:46:25.381 --> 00:46:28.670
<v Speaker 1>I met him this past weekend in Bozeman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that struck me is</v>

1101
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:31.380
<v Speaker 1>when you and I were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this fucking crazy fire in your</v>

1102
00:46:31.381 --> 00:46:31.560
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

1103
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.320
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be the guy that kills the</v>

1104
00:46:34.321 --> 00:46:36.900
<v Speaker 1>biggest bowl every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I killed one big bowl,</v>

1105
00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want it to just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1106
00:46:38.521 --> 00:46:40.800
<v Speaker 1>it was just a fluke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When now you gotta be consistent.</v>

1107
00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:41.761
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1108
00:46:41.761 --> 00:46:43.500
<v Speaker 1>this crazy motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see where he's at.</v>

1109
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:47.520
<v Speaker 1>And then when you told me that you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gigantic bull down in sneeze,</v>

1110
00:46:47.521 --> 00:46:49.920
<v Speaker 1>which is a store on main street in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bozeman,</v>

1111
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:51.990
<v Speaker 1>I went to the store just to see that</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowl.</v>

1112
00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:53.400
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to stop it.</v>

1113
00:46:53.401 --> 00:46:54.720
<v Speaker 1>And I gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta take a look at this thing.</v>

1114
00:46:54.721 --> 00:46:58.050
<v Speaker 1>And this is elk that looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>something out of the Lord of the rings</v>

1115
00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.150
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't even look like a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

1116
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.200
<v Speaker 1>It's breathtaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking mass,</v>

1117
00:47:02.201 --> 00:47:02.880
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1118
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:06.680
<v Speaker 1>as you walk up to that thing and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it and you literally stopped</v>

1119
00:47:06.681 --> 00:47:09.900
<v Speaker 1>shooting attracts explained the weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the antlers on that thing.</v>

1120
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:12.600
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's obviously an unusually big,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I mean it is a Shaquille o'neal of</v>

1125

<v Speaker 1>elk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

00:48:02.191 --> 00:48:04.450
<v Speaker 4>the Roosevelt elk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the ones that have the biggest</v>

1147
00:48:04.451 --> 00:48:05.284
<v Speaker 4>bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1148
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.680
<v Speaker 4>The Roosevelt elk have the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by far the biggest bodies.</v>

1149
00:48:08.681 --> 00:48:09.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But not,</v>

1150
00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:10.960
<v Speaker 4>not the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the biggest,</v>

1151
00:48:10.961 --> 00:48:11.880
<v Speaker 4>not the biggest antlers.</v>

1152
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:16.510
<v Speaker 4>Like how big of their bodies get 1200.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a really big bulls.</v>

1153
00:48:16.511 --> 00:48:17.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see in photos of them,</v>

1154
00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:19.690
<v Speaker 4>they're just enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1155
00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:21.970
<v Speaker 4>they are unusually giant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1156
00:48:21.971 --> 00:48:23.350
<v Speaker 4>especially the really big bull,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1157
00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:24.460
<v Speaker 4>and a con,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1158
00:48:24.461 --> 00:48:26.080
<v Speaker 4>like not every elk is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1159
00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:30.040
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An old bowl who's had good feed and</v>

1160
00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:32.650
<v Speaker 4>lived a long time and was genetically</v>
<v Speaker 4>big to begin with,</v>

1161
00:48:32.651 --> 00:48:34.420
<v Speaker 4>we'll be really big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're not,</v>

1162
00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:36.040
<v Speaker 4>they don't all end up huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1163
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.330
<v Speaker 4>they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the ones he hunts.</v>

1164
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:42.040
<v Speaker 4>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's a fascinating pursuit,</v>

1165
00:48:42.041 --> 00:48:43.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pursuing the,</v>

1166
00:48:43.331 --> 00:48:45.280
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the apex of the genetics,</v>

1167
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>finding the animal.</v>

1168
00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:51.100
<v Speaker 4>And it's also one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>important about this,</v>

1169
00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.750
<v Speaker 4>like the pursuit of hunting is that this</v>
<v Speaker 4>animal that you shot was probably like</v>

1170
00:48:55.751 --> 00:48:56.950
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How old do you think he was?</v>

1171
00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:00.190
<v Speaker 4>He was 12 years old and that is an old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>old l that is,</v>

1172
00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.250
<v Speaker 4>that's old age in the world of wild</v>
<v Speaker 4>beasts.</v>

1173
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.830
<v Speaker 4>It's the ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like when you get to the level</v>

1174
00:49:05.831 --> 00:49:07.530
<v Speaker 4>where you're consistently killing stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1175
00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:08.710
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're,</v>

1176
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:10.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've gotten to the point that the</v>

1177
00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:13.780
<v Speaker 4>ultimate level is to kill the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oldest,</v>

1178
00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:15.460
<v Speaker 4>most mature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1179
00:49:15.461 --> 00:49:18.610
<v Speaker 4>historically significant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Went on that on a chain of events,</v>

1180
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.430
<v Speaker 4>in history of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the guys I've ever killed elk mean,</v>

1181
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:25.840
<v Speaker 4>not ll card design are going to be huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But with any animals like when you kill</v>

1182
00:49:25.841 --> 00:49:28.480
<v Speaker 4>something is super old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super big,</v>

1183
00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.240
<v Speaker 4>super smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the pinnacle of where your</v>

1184
00:49:31.241 --> 00:49:34.030
<v Speaker 4>skills have gotten in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a lot of people never get there,</v>

1185
00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.051
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>based on,</v>

1186
00:49:35.051 --> 00:49:36.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have time.</v>

1187
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the biggest factor in kill in doing that</v>

1188
00:49:38.501 --> 00:49:40.270
<v Speaker 4>and getting to that point is having the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

1189
00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just just having the time to,</v>

1190
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spent a decade of my life putting a</v>

1191
00:49:45.281 --> 00:49:46.540
<v Speaker 4>blue track everywhere.</v>

1192
00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:50.230
<v Speaker 4>You could put one finding where every</v>
<v Speaker 4>alk was in my state and looking for the</v>

1193
00:49:50.231 --> 00:49:51.930
<v Speaker 4>biggest ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it is like,</v>

1194
00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:53.890
<v Speaker 4>like the work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's consuming you.</v>

1195
00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:56.950
<v Speaker 4>You have to love to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not fun.</v>

1196
00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:59.080
<v Speaker 4>You would just have to be driven to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1197
00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:01.030
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to want to want to be able to do it.</v>

1198
00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:04.810
<v Speaker 4>But the result is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that the photo that you sent and</v>

1199
00:50:04.811 --> 00:50:08.200
<v Speaker 4>he sent me some text messages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>photos of that thing on the ground.</v>

1200
00:50:08.201 --> 00:50:10.980
<v Speaker 4>You see the size of the antlers?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1201
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.820
<v Speaker 4>that's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another one he shot.</v>

1202
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:15.220
<v Speaker 4>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a pretty big one too.</v>

1203
00:50:15.221 --> 00:50:17.580
<v Speaker 4>But that's not nearly as big as the one</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want me to send a t?</v>

1204
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:18.430
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll send it to you,</v>

1205
00:50:18.431 --> 00:50:19.620
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1206
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.700
<v Speaker 4>should I email it to you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either way.</v>

1207
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:23.090
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1208
00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:24.520
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was,</v>

1209
00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:25.541
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the,</v>

1210
00:50:25.541 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 4>at that point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually when I killed that elk,</v>

1211
00:50:28.071 --> 00:50:29.690
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't at the skill set I am now.</v>

1212
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:31.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got pretty lucky that was a third El</v>

1213
00:50:31.331 --> 00:50:35.440
<v Speaker 4>cobre killed right place the right time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did the right thing and you know,</v>

1214
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.610
<v Speaker 4>just lit a fire in me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I want to do that more.</v>

1215
00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's ridiculous that that was the</v>

1216
00:50:40.251 --> 00:50:43.670
<v Speaker 4>third</v>
<v Speaker 4>first started talking to Brenda about</v>

1217
00:50:43.671 --> 00:50:46.730
<v Speaker 4>hunting elk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would hunt elk and that was so</v>

1218
00:50:46.731 --> 00:50:47.600
<v Speaker 4>different for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1219
00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:49.730
<v Speaker 4>I was just trying to find a boulder</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt,</v>

1220
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:52.130
<v Speaker 4>any bull,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I would try to get a good one,</v>

1221
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:56.030
<v Speaker 4>but Brendan would hunt and find Anelka</v>
<v Speaker 4>and spend the entire season trying to</v>

1222
00:50:56.031 --> 00:50:57.650
<v Speaker 4>kill that single up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I thought,</v>

1223
00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:00.410
<v Speaker 4>at least my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll kind of was fine.</v>

1224
00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.800
<v Speaker 4>Hard to find that same aisle twice that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd maybe see in the morning and I would</v>

1225
00:51:03.801 --> 00:51:06.260
<v Speaker 4>never see it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Britain had the ability to hunt it down</v>

1226
00:51:06.261 --> 00:51:07.430
<v Speaker 4>and kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1227
00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:10.670
<v Speaker 4>it's also the best thing from a</v>
<v Speaker 4>conservation standpoint,</v>

1228
00:51:10.671 --> 00:51:15.140
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about an animal that has</v>
<v Speaker 4>spread its genes for at least 10 years.</v>

1229
00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.400
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For 10 years,</v>

1230
00:51:16.401 --> 00:51:19.960
<v Speaker 4>that thing has been spreading those</v>
<v Speaker 4>superior genetics and it's probably been</v>

1231
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.520
<v Speaker 4>forced in a lot of other males to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck off the mountain.</v>

1232
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when would me,</v>

1233
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.970
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that one did.</v>

1234
00:51:25.971 --> 00:51:29.300
<v Speaker 4>I never saw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched him for three days morning and</v>

1235
00:51:29.301 --> 00:51:32.660
<v Speaker 4>night before I killed them and he knew</v>
<v Speaker 4>another bull never came near that thing.</v>

1236
00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.430
<v Speaker 4>You have to beat Brock Lesner of elk</v>
<v Speaker 4>or Alistair overeem.</v>

1237
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:38.463
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1238
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:42.410
<v Speaker 4>When you're going to a old like ubering</v>
<v Speaker 4>old allister.</v>

1239
00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:44.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>allister still on the Mexican</v>

1240
00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:46.470
<v Speaker 4>supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1241
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The new house,</v>

1242
00:51:48.121 --> 00:51:49.400
<v Speaker 4>there might be a better fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>

1243
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:50.610
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1244
00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:53.060
<v Speaker 4>when you see an animal like that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1245
00:51:53.061 --> 00:51:53.841
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1246
00:51:53.841 --> 00:51:58.841
<v Speaker 4>you realize how difficult it is to reach</v>
<v Speaker 4>12 years of age in the wild with</v>

1247
00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.440
<v Speaker 4>mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wolves.</v>

1248
00:52:00.441 --> 00:52:01.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Montana,</v>

1249
00:52:01.281 --> 00:52:03.770
<v Speaker 4>it's like he's just got everything after</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm grizzlies,</v>

1250
00:52:03.771 --> 00:52:04.640
<v Speaker 4>everything's after him.</v>

1251
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:09.910
<v Speaker 4>And to be able to be that smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get to this position in life and for</v>

1252
00:52:10.881 --> 00:52:14.900
<v Speaker 4>you to solve that puzzle and to get in</v>
<v Speaker 4>and shoot that elk,</v>

1253
00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:17.480
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the things that sort of</v>

1254
00:52:17.481 --> 00:52:20.030
<v Speaker 4>embodies the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the divide,</v>

1255
00:52:20.031 --> 00:52:24.100
<v Speaker 4>really intense difficulty in hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1256
00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:26.160
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those things where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1257
00:52:26.161 --> 00:52:27.530
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the ultimate challenge.</v>

1258
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:28.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you've,</v>

1259
00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>killed a bunch of elk and you know,</v>

1260
00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:33.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets to where it is the ultimate</v>

1261
00:52:33.771 --> 00:52:35.000
<v Speaker 4>challenge and you're not always going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>win.</v>

1262
00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:36.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't always get them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1263
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.670
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the beauty of it.</v>

1264
00:52:37.671 --> 00:52:39.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you never get to the point where</v>

1265
00:52:39.561 --> 00:52:40.910
<v Speaker 4>you're so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1266
00:52:40.911 --> 00:52:43.760
<v Speaker 4>I haven't got to the point where I'm so</v>
<v Speaker 4>good where every great big one I get.</v>

1267
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:44.743
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1268
00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.880
<v Speaker 4>it's getting there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting closer.</v>

1269
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:48.170
<v Speaker 4>But they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1270
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:51.200
<v Speaker 4>like you're learning stuff all the time</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's one of those things nobody can</v>

1271
00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:52.190
<v Speaker 4>tell you about you.</v>

1272
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.030
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1273
00:52:53.031 --> 00:52:54.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm basically self taught.</v>

1274
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:57.710
<v Speaker 4>My Dad taught,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taught me how to read maps and until you</v>

1275
00:52:57.711 --> 00:52:58.544
<v Speaker 4>figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1276
00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.340
<v Speaker 4>why isn't elk here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

1277
00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.630
<v Speaker 4>what's he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1278
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:04.580
<v Speaker 4>and not just wandering around like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1279
00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:05.900
<v Speaker 4>there's some elk over there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

1280
00:53:05.901 --> 00:53:08.090
<v Speaker 4>why is he here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would he be here this time of year?</v>

1281
00:53:08.091 --> 00:53:10.250
<v Speaker 4>What is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's he going?</v>

1282
00:53:10.251 --> 00:53:11.390
<v Speaker 4>What's his next move?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1283
00:53:11.391 --> 00:53:14.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had bulls where I've hunted where I</v>

1284
00:53:14.151 --> 00:53:16.460
<v Speaker 4>know what they're going to do before</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do a little worry.</v>

1285
00:53:16.461 --> 00:53:17.960
<v Speaker 4>I know what that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that bowl was down here.</v>

1286
00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:20.450
<v Speaker 4>He was doing this and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I know what he's gonna do.</v>

1287
00:53:20.451 --> 00:53:23.540
<v Speaker 4>And I go the other direction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come around the other way.</v>

1288
00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:25.680
<v Speaker 4>And that's what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew before he was going to do it.</v>

1289
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:26.880
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

1290
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:30.450
<v Speaker 4>it just comes from watching them</v>
<v Speaker 4>spending thousands of hours and tis data</v>

1291
00:53:30.451 --> 00:53:31.284
<v Speaker 4>chunking.</v>

1292
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

1293
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:33.281
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1294
00:53:33.281 --> 00:53:34.650
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see the picture of the great big</v>

1295
00:53:34.651 --> 00:53:35.730
<v Speaker 4>bowls and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1296
00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:38.040
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there is worth the time,</v>

1297
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:41.310
<v Speaker 4>the time that goes into that you'd like</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody ever sees and they don't see</v>

1298
00:53:41.311 --> 00:53:43.890
<v Speaker 4>hundreds and hundreds of days in</v>
<v Speaker 4>between.</v>

1299
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:45.270
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1300
00:53:45.271 --> 00:53:46.340
<v Speaker 4>I was a young guy there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1301
00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:49.020
<v Speaker 4>2022 years old there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

1302
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:50.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

1303
00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:52.410
<v Speaker 4>It is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you eat that animal,</v>

1304
00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:57.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean the amount of satisfaction that</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes from sitting down to a meal that</v>

1305
00:53:58.111 --> 00:54:01.620
<v Speaker 4>you procured and the most difficult way</v>
<v Speaker 4>humanly possible.</v>

1306
00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot the thing with a bow and Arrow in</v>

1307
00:54:04.231 --> 00:54:06.450
<v Speaker 4>the mountains and now here you are</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating it.</v>

1308
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:09.860
<v Speaker 4>12 yards snuck right upon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1309
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:11.821
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cool.</v>

1310
00:54:11.821 --> 00:54:12.371
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1311
00:54:12.371 --> 00:54:14.610
<v Speaker 4>the thing about trophy hunting that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not understood.</v>

1312
00:54:14.611 --> 00:54:16.110
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the ultimate,</v>

1313
00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:19.020
<v Speaker 4>it's the pinnacle of combining,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1314
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:21.720
<v Speaker 4>what you love to do and then this</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible skill set that you're</v>

1315
00:54:21.721 --> 00:54:23.720
<v Speaker 4>developing to be better than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1316
00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying better than anybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it takes a lot of work,</v>

1317
00:54:26.301 --> 00:54:27.570
<v Speaker 4>like better than you used to be.</v>

1318
00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:29.520
<v Speaker 4>Better than you used to eat to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>better and better.</v>

1319
00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:30.241
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1320
00:54:30.241 --> 00:54:33.090
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the funny thing to me is always like</v>

1321
00:54:33.091 --> 00:54:34.650
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing trophy hunting has got this</v>

1322
00:54:34.651 --> 00:54:37.320
<v Speaker 4>weird stigma with it or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

1323
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.310
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1324
00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:41.280
<v Speaker 4>I eat the whole elk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love doing it.</v>

1325
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:43.020
<v Speaker 4>I love the challenge of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1326
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:44.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't shy away from saying I love to</v>

1327
00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:46.590
<v Speaker 4>kill animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like,</v>

1328
00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:49.080
<v Speaker 4>I love to hunt them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the challenge of,</v>

1329
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:49.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take,</v>

1330
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:51.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of getting the biggest one.</v>

1331
00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:54.150
<v Speaker 4>I find it the most challenging thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've ever done,</v>

1332
00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:55.500
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1333
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:56.640
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always eat it.</v>

1334
00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.830
<v Speaker 4>I eat everything and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1335
00:54:58.831 --> 00:55:00.240
<v Speaker 4>and I take the hide and the head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1336
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:01.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm using more than most people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1337
00:55:01.981 --> 00:55:03.900
<v Speaker 4>people like I just trophy hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 4>where be like,</v>

1338
00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:05.010
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1339
00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:05.640
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1340
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:06.840
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the challenge.</v>

1341
00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.620
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1342
00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:10.200
<v Speaker 4>the term needs to be changed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the challenge of it.</v>

1343
00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the term is kind of screwed up because</v>

1344
00:55:12.361 --> 00:55:15.060
<v Speaker 4>it's applied to things that people shoot</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they don't need it.</v>

1345
00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.500
<v Speaker 4>And which seems to be like a cruelty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

1346
00:55:18.501 --> 00:55:22.200
<v Speaker 4>a pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a vain pursuit of going out and shooting</v>

1347
00:55:22.201 --> 00:55:24.140
<v Speaker 4>lions and shooting things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to eat.</v>

1348
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:27.180
<v Speaker 4>The weird thing about that is I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to a guy was doing an</v>

1349
00:55:27.181 --> 00:55:29.550
<v Speaker 4>article for the New York Times and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

1350
00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:31.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a problem with people with</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting,</v>

1351
00:55:31.741 --> 00:55:32.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long as you eat it.</v>

1352
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:34.680
<v Speaker 4>And I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a problem with hunting.</v>

1353
00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:35.941
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1354
00:55:35.941 --> 00:55:37.980
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you legally have to take the meat.</v>

1355
00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:39.510
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1356
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:42.660
<v Speaker 4>the amount of people that would shoot</v>
<v Speaker 4>something and not take the meat is,</v>

1357
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:46.200
<v Speaker 4>is the same as people that are thieves</v>
<v Speaker 4>out on the street.</v>

1358
00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so uncommon.</v>

1359
00:55:47.791 --> 00:55:50.040
<v Speaker 4>So like the perception of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1360
00:55:50.041 --> 00:55:52.650
<v Speaker 4>guys just shooting it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just because 10 years down the road,</v>

1361
00:55:52.651 --> 00:55:55.770
<v Speaker 4>all I have in my garage as the head</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean that I didn't use it.</v>

1362
00:55:55.771 --> 00:55:57.210
<v Speaker 4>And so the perception,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1363
00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.860
<v Speaker 4>against the lowest common denominator</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>

1364
00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:02.940
<v Speaker 4>you hear about one horrible thing going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on or somebody that doesn't take the</v>

1365
00:56:02.941 --> 00:56:05.040
<v Speaker 4>meat and all of a sudden it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's lumped into it.</v>

1366
00:56:05.041 --> 00:56:07.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in rural Montana.</v>

1367
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:12.300
<v Speaker 4>I never had a beef steak at a restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 4>until I was on a recruiting trip in</v>

1368
00:56:12.301 --> 00:56:12.901
<v Speaker 4>college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1369
00:56:12.901 --> 00:56:15.450
<v Speaker 4>I grew up eating wild game my entire</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1370
00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.360
<v Speaker 4>I never had my parents never bought meat</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

1371
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.070
<v Speaker 4>That's probably why he's such a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestler.</v>

1372
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:20.671
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess,</v>

1373
00:56:20.671 --> 00:56:23.770
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get that fucking tear protein kicked</v>

1374
00:56:23.771 --> 00:56:24.604
<v Speaker 4>that wild</v>

1375
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:26.350
<v Speaker 1>DNA in your system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Free Range.</v>

1376
00:56:26.351 --> 00:56:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Organic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1377
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1378
00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:30.400
<v Speaker 1>that's the real food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like a disconnect.</v>

1379
00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:32.010
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man that you,</v>

1380
00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:33.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you don't need to do that.</v>

1381
00:56:33.641 --> 00:56:36.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm not saying we didn't need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

1382
00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:37.510
<v Speaker 1>That's just what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1383
00:56:37.511 --> 00:56:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in an area where that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we,</v>

1384
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.171
<v Speaker 1>that's what I ate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1385
00:56:41.171 --> 00:56:42.004
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

1386
00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.500
<v Speaker 1>my parents never bought meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1387
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:45.160
<v Speaker 1>The math section of hunting today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so screwed up.</v>

1388
00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.140
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also because of cities.</v>

1389
00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:49.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's made us be able</v>

1390
00:56:49.481 --> 00:56:52.630
<v Speaker 1>to be so comfortable and have air</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning is technology and</v>

1391
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:55.270
<v Speaker 1>advancement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also allowed us to be</v>

1392
00:56:55.271 --> 00:56:57.970
<v Speaker 1>completely disconnected from where food</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from.</v>

1393
00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's what allows people to stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>up on these pedestals and point down at</v>

1394
00:57:02.861 --> 00:57:05.380
<v Speaker 1>people that they think are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong.</v>

1395
00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:08.200
<v Speaker 1>When they're responsible for just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much death.</v>

1396
00:57:08.201 --> 00:57:11.000
<v Speaker 1>They're responsible for more suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More suffer.</v>

1397
00:57:11.001 --> 00:57:11.834
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1398
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More suffering than hunters for sure.</v>

1399
00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just as much death too.</v>

1400
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:19.240
<v Speaker 1>And even people that are vegetarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even people that are,</v>

1401
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:23.440
<v Speaker 1>they think that by eating vegetables and</v>
<v Speaker 1>plants that they're doing no harm.</v>

1402
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:28.590
<v Speaker 1>The amount of wildlife habitat</v>
<v Speaker 1>displacement that takes place in just</v>

1403
00:57:28.841 --> 00:57:32.290
<v Speaker 1>growing Kale is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all the pesticides and everything</v>

1404
00:57:32.291 --> 00:57:35.440
<v Speaker 1>else that goes into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my knees and the fucking rodents</v>

1405
00:57:35.441 --> 00:57:40.441
<v Speaker 1>and all the different death that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with combines and widescale a</v>

1406
00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.460
<v Speaker 1>grain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1407
00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:45.160
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a growing and harvesting</v>

1408
00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:47.890
<v Speaker 1>grain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does so much death and vulnerable and</v>

1409
00:57:47.891 --> 00:57:49.240
<v Speaker 1>there's no getting around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1410
00:57:49.241 --> 00:57:51.730
<v Speaker 1>we are consumers in some sort of a weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1411
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.170
<v Speaker 1>but to me the purest pursuit of it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about.</v>

1412
00:57:56.290 --> 00:58:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Archery hunting in the backwoods in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most difficult environments.</v>

1413
00:58:01.241 --> 00:58:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is unbelievably difficult pursuit</v>

1414
00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:09.040
<v Speaker 1>that somehow or another it gets lumped</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this idea that it's a bunch of dumb</v>

1415
00:58:09.041 --> 00:58:11.140
<v Speaker 1>people in their cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're dumb,</v>

1416
00:58:11.141 --> 00:58:12.820
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be successful doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1417
00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:15.250
<v Speaker 1>And if you're lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be successful.</v>

1418
00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.980
<v Speaker 2>You just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1419
00:58:16.981 --> 00:58:18.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been,</v>

1420
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:19.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a coup,</v>

1421
00:58:19.181 --> 00:58:23.190
<v Speaker 2>you had been in New York during a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of media tours over the last year and to</v>

1422
00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:28.340
<v Speaker 2>be interviewed by these people that live</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a big city that have no idea of what</v>

1423
00:58:28.771 --> 00:58:32.610
<v Speaker 2>hunting is like or what it's about is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really mind blowing to me because it's</v>

1424
00:58:32.611 --> 00:58:35.280
<v Speaker 2>been such a big part of my life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone I'm associated with and friends</v>

1425
00:58:35.281 --> 00:58:37.770
<v Speaker 2>with typically Hans or understands</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>

1426
00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:43.250
<v Speaker 2>their perception of it is so amazing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me that we would just kill an animal,</v>

1427
00:58:44.791 --> 00:58:48.990
<v Speaker 2>cut its head off and leave everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anybody that's ever done</v>

1428
00:58:48.991 --> 00:58:50.850
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's completely illegal.</v>

1429
00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:54.330
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what mainstream media is made</v>

1430
00:58:54.331 --> 00:58:54.960
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>

1431
00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.420
<v Speaker 2>hunting to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like a mission of mine now to</v>

1432
00:58:57.421 --> 00:58:59.310
<v Speaker 2>change that perception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And mine as well.</v>

1433
00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:00.510
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lazy,</v>

1434
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:03.750
<v Speaker 2>it's a lazy perception of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not real.</v>

1435
00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:05.100
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

1436
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:06.810
<v Speaker 2>not for real hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1437
00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.670
<v Speaker 2>It absolutely does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never happens.</v>

1438
00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like this New York Times.</v>

1439
00:59:10.291 --> 00:59:10.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

1440
00:59:10.921 --> 00:59:11.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's it,</v>

1441
00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:13.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took them through like the wanton</v>

1442
00:59:13.021 --> 00:59:15.090
<v Speaker 2>waste laws and all that and he was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1443
00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:15.721
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1444
00:59:15.721 --> 00:59:17.350
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>

1445
00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:20.550
<v Speaker 2>you legally have to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not,</v>

1446
00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 2>it's not something that's new,</v>

1447
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's,</v>

1448
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:25.190
<v Speaker 4>it's always been that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there is this cool meet</v>

1449
00:59:25.191 --> 00:59:27.180
<v Speaker 4>movement that's been going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1450
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.910
<v Speaker 4>one thing it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get it lost that,</v>

1451
00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:30.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys in the 60s,</v>

1452
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:31.010
<v Speaker 4>seventies all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1453
00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.090
<v Speaker 4>since,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1454
00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:33.830
<v Speaker 4>aside from market hunting back in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>

1455
00:59:33.831 --> 00:59:36.490
<v Speaker 4>which isn't real hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just extermination for,</v>

1456
00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:37.760
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1457
00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:41.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people hunt and they consume what they</v>

1458
00:59:41.211 --> 00:59:42.560
<v Speaker 4>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like anything else,</v>

1459
00:59:42.561 --> 00:59:45.900
<v Speaker 4>just like eating bread or any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything else?</v>

1460
00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:46.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>

1461
00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:47.143
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1462
00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:49.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got studs in your house.</v>

1463
00:59:49.551 --> 00:59:52.160
<v Speaker 4>They came from a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's where they came from.</v>

1464
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.333
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1465
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always say if you want to fix the</v>

1466
00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:58.130
<v Speaker 4>health problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States make everybody hunt.</v>

1467
00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:00.950
<v Speaker 4>The problem is none of the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's too many people.</v>

1468
01:00:00.951 --> 01:00:03.470
<v Speaker 4>And then to find those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like obesity,</v>

1469
01:00:03.471 --> 01:00:04.470
<v Speaker 4>overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1470
01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:06.530
<v Speaker 4>poor diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make them all hunters.</v>

1471
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:08.720
<v Speaker 4>That all goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does all go away cause they have to</v>

1472
01:00:08.721 --> 01:00:10.880
<v Speaker 4>live a lifestyle to actually harvest an</v>
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>

1473
01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To change everything in hunting.</v>

1474
01:00:12.531 --> 01:00:12.951
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1475
01:00:12.951 --> 01:00:14.720
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been our DNA for 2 million years</v>

1476
01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.880
<v Speaker 4>and just the last hundred that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>had an issue with it.</v>

1477
01:00:16.881 --> 01:00:19.310
<v Speaker 4>Not actually the last 50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1478
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:22.220
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's when you see things like the</v>

1479
01:00:22.221 --> 01:00:24.680
<v Speaker 4>cecil the lion thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then everybody gets up at arms about</v>

1480
01:00:24.681 --> 01:00:28.940
<v Speaker 4>hunting and it just becomes this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this really distorted version of what it</v>

1481
01:00:28.941 --> 01:00:29.810
<v Speaker 4>actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1482
01:00:29.811 --> 01:00:31.640
<v Speaker 4>But this stuff with Cecil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not even true.</v>

1483
01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:33.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't,</v>

1484
01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't living full time in the park.</v>

1485
01:00:35.751 --> 01:00:37.850
<v Speaker 4>There's a new thing that just came out</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the hunt report about the,</v>

1486
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:40.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean the whole background of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

1487
01:00:40.161 --> 01:00:42.650
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot more to it than that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all how you,</v>

1488
01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:43.940
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it said too,</v>

1489
01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:44.930
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1490
01:00:44.931 --> 01:00:49.070
<v Speaker 4>all the guy killed cecil line who was</v>
<v Speaker 4>just super old male who had been kicked</v>

1491
01:00:49.071 --> 01:00:50.630
<v Speaker 4>out of the pride apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1492
01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.350
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

1493
01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:53.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that whole thing with his brothers and</v>

1494
01:00:53.061 --> 01:00:53.990
<v Speaker 4>the family and all that.</v>

1495
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.730
<v Speaker 4>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at the end of the day it's like,</v>

1496
01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.121
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1497
01:00:56.121 --> 01:00:57.680
<v Speaker 4>it was shot him and beheaded them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1498
01:00:57.681 --> 01:00:57.951
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1499
01:00:57.951 --> 01:00:59.780
<v Speaker 4>that burger you got at Mcdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guess what?</v>

1500
01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:02.060
<v Speaker 4>It died and got beheaded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all how you would word it.</v>

1501
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:05.030
<v Speaker 4>You could also say it was processed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like it just beheaded.</v>

1502
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:06.860
<v Speaker 4>This is a horrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

1503
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:09.080
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that gets killed and process</v>

1504
01:01:09.081 --> 01:01:12.170
<v Speaker 4>gets beheaded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But don't you think that part of the</v>

1505
01:01:12.171 --> 01:01:15.170
<v Speaker 4>reason why people get upset about lions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because people generally don't eat</v>

1506
01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:17.540
<v Speaker 4>lions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when someone says that someone goes</v>

1507
01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:20.330
<v Speaker 4>and shoots a line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like why would you shoot this beautiful,</v>

1508
01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:21.860
<v Speaker 4>rare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>majestic animal?</v>

1509
01:01:21.861 --> 01:01:26.861
<v Speaker 4>Just he could stick it on your wall and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just think you're a bad ass because</v>

1510
01:01:26.931 --> 01:01:30.140
<v Speaker 4>you've got this thing that could kill</v>
<v Speaker 4>you if you didn't have a weapon and</v>

1511
01:01:30.141 --> 01:01:31.370
<v Speaker 4>you've got it on your wall now.</v>

1512
01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:32.931
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1513
01:01:32.931 --> 01:01:34.850
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes down to like predators need to</v>

1514
01:01:34.851 --> 01:01:35.900
<v Speaker 4>be controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1515
01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:37.220
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not one of those things that's</v>

1516
01:01:37.221 --> 01:01:39.080
<v Speaker 4>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people really love to hear that.</v>

1517
01:01:39.081 --> 01:01:40.760
<v Speaker 4>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is true.</v>

1518
01:01:40.761 --> 01:01:41.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1519
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:43.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were just down where I grew up.</v>

1520
01:01:43.041 --> 01:01:45.210
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in just north of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1521
01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:47.470
<v Speaker 4>of the greater yellowstone elk herd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1522
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:49.190
<v Speaker 4>between gardener and Livingston.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where I grew up.</v>

1523
01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:52.610
<v Speaker 4>And when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was 19,000 elk in that hurt.</v>

1524
01:01:52.611 --> 01:01:55.070
<v Speaker 4>You go down there and wintertime is he</v>
<v Speaker 4>1500 bulls.</v>

1525
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.881
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1526
01:01:55.881 --> 01:01:58.670
<v Speaker 4>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're down to two to 3000 now</v>

1527
01:01:58.671 --> 01:01:59.390
<v Speaker 4>because of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1528
01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:00.710
<v Speaker 4>the reintroduction of the wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1529
01:02:00.711 --> 01:02:03.310
<v Speaker 4>like you have to control predators,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1530
01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.820
<v Speaker 4>anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever they're at.</v>

1531
01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:05.654
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1532
01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:10.660
<v Speaker 4>it's insane to think that we don't exist</v>
<v Speaker 4>and these houses and fences and highways</v>

1533
01:02:11.601 --> 01:02:14.690
<v Speaker 4>and stuff are not there and that you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>just turn something loose and just let</v>

1534
01:02:14.691 --> 01:02:16.880
<v Speaker 4>it run its course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know what you mean?</v>

1535
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.500
<v Speaker 4>People or even appalled by the natural</v>
<v Speaker 4>core.</v>

1536
01:02:19.501 --> 01:02:20.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you see</v>

1537
01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:26.030
<v Speaker 1>a young lion take over the pride and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cecil gets chumped and destroyed by two</v>

1538
01:02:26.221 --> 01:02:27.830
<v Speaker 1>other younger lines that came in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>

1539
01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>when people don't even like seeing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1540
01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just attachment.</v>

1541
01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Just detachment from the actual cycle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1542
01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:34.793
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1543
01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing that's going on is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people love to,</v>

1544
01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:38.710
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1545
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:43.710
<v Speaker 1>they love to broadcast how horrible the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are that hunt these things and</v>

1546
01:02:43.741 --> 01:02:46.740
<v Speaker 1>how these lions are new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to be preserved.</v>

1547
01:02:46.741 --> 01:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>And it's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Leonardo Dicaprio had something on</v>

1548
01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>his instagram page the other day where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like an anniversary of the death</v>

1549
01:02:53.401 --> 01:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>of Cecil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was talking about how,</v>

1550
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:57.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few of these animals that are left,</v>

1551
01:02:57.901 --> 01:03:00.170
<v Speaker 1>they have to be protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he see,</v>

1552
01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Rick conveniently ignores the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zimbabwe is going to kill 200 lions now</v>

1553
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.610
<v Speaker 1>because no one's going over there to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt those lines.</v>

1554
01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:10.350
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more of them.</v>

1555
01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>So they're decimating the undulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>

1556
01:03:12.401 --> 01:03:14.190
<v Speaker 1>so now they're going to kill them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make no money.</v>

1557
01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.890
<v Speaker 1>So they're gonna lose out on millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars in revenue.</v>

1558
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:20.010
<v Speaker 1>What would you expect from a guy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had got attacked by a CGI bear?</v>

1559
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:23.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't live in reality anyway,</v>

1560
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:25.550
<v Speaker 1>I CGI,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you probably didn't even ride.</v>

1561
01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.170
<v Speaker 1>He's probably doing coke and banging</v>
<v Speaker 1>hookers.</v>

1562
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Call assists that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

1563
01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:33.210
<v Speaker 1>put something eco on my page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CCS anniversary.</v>

1564
01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're now they can't.</v>

1565
01:03:34.471 --> 01:03:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a ton of money they could</v>

1566
01:03:35.671 --> 01:03:37.710
<v Speaker 1>generate to shoot those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know guy,</v>

1567
01:03:37.711 --> 01:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know booking,</v>

1568
01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:39.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to him all the time.</v>

1569
01:03:39.421 --> 01:03:41.580
<v Speaker 1>There's guy that nobody will touch that</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a 10 foot pole.</v>

1570
01:03:41.581 --> 01:03:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great hunt.</v>

1571
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:45.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool thing to go see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do need to be managed.</v>

1572
01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1573
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.160
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of things like it just is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is very,</v>

1574
01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:53.370
<v Speaker 1>it's very inconvenient when you look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual facts of,</v>

1575
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:55.500
<v Speaker 1>of hunting over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even hunting,</v>

1576
01:03:55.501 --> 01:03:57.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just quote unquote for trophies.</v>

1577
01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.690
<v Speaker 1>That is where they get a massive amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their revenue.</v>

1578
01:04:00.691 --> 01:04:02.700
<v Speaker 1>It feeds a lot of the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>over there.</v>

1579
01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:06.120
<v Speaker 1>It makes a huge impact on their economy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people don't like that.</v>

1580
01:04:06.121 --> 01:04:11.121
<v Speaker 1>But I urge people to watch the Louis</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theroux documentary about his trip to</v>

1581
01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Africa where he spent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he spent several weeks in this African</v>

1582
01:04:14.701 --> 01:04:17.520
<v Speaker 1>hunting camp and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the same thing was it was like a</v>

1583
01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:21.570
<v Speaker 1>high fence operation where they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>lions and they were throwing like calves</v>

1584
01:04:21.571 --> 01:04:24.990
<v Speaker 1>over the fence to feed these lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like two fences separating him</v>

1585
01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:28.650
<v Speaker 1>from the lions and he got to see like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>depth what's going on.</v>

1586
01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:31.830
<v Speaker 1>He's essentially saying that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

1587
01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.940
<v Speaker 1>the only reason why they're here at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like massive amounts of them is because</v>

1588
01:04:35.941 --> 01:04:37.830
<v Speaker 1>they're worth something because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to come over.</v>

1589
01:04:37.831 --> 01:04:42.831
<v Speaker 1>And if it wasn't that like this place is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so poor and so crazy that these animals</v>

1590
01:04:43.771 --> 01:04:44.780
<v Speaker 1>would have been wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1591
01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.940
<v Speaker 1>and they were on the verge just a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of decades ago before the introduced</v>

1592
01:04:47.941 --> 01:04:50.460
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's such a catch 22 because they</v>

1593
01:04:50.461 --> 01:04:52.680
<v Speaker 1>have more animals than they've ever had</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1594
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:55.860
<v Speaker 1>But the reason for that is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're worth something to hunt.</v>

1595
01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Exactly their economic resource.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that they have value.</v>

1596
01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.760
<v Speaker 1>So they're protected and there's money</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect him and people get put off by</v>

1597
01:05:02.761 --> 01:05:05.040
<v Speaker 1>the fact that people enjoy that pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1598
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1599
01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:09.630
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things like I have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard time explaining it to people that,</v>

1600
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:12.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what makes a little kid who when</v>

1601
01:05:12.901 --> 01:05:14.400
<v Speaker 1>you're in the yard and there's a bird</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there,</v>

1602
01:05:14.401 --> 01:05:15.870
<v Speaker 1>like some kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1603
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>just look at it and some want to chase</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing</v>

1604
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:22.470
<v Speaker 3>down and it's like 10,000 years where</v>
<v Speaker 3>the genetics at say 2 million actually.</v>

1605
01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to do it like this is something</v>

1606
01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:26.650
<v Speaker 3>that is built in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to do,</v>

1607
01:05:26.651 --> 01:05:29.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean you felt that you didn't draw up</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting then all of a sudden now you,</v>

1608
01:05:29.970 --> 01:05:30.803
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1609
01:05:30.830 --> 01:05:32.290
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you think about it every day.</v>

1610
01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:33.610
<v Speaker 3>That's all you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

1611
01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.900
<v Speaker 3>And so to explain that to somebody that</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have that,</v>

1612
01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.550
<v Speaker 3>it's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1613
01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially whether eating a hamburger on</v>

1614
01:05:42.281 --> 01:05:44.850
<v Speaker 3>from their pedestal telling you how you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1615
01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:47.500
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't kill anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1616
01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:50.110
<v Speaker 3>Well I almost think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't think anybody should be</v>

1617
01:05:50.111 --> 01:05:52.810
<v Speaker 3>forced to do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I almost think that it would be good</v>

1618
01:05:52.811 --> 01:05:55.300
<v Speaker 3>for everybody to have to kill something</v>
<v Speaker 3>and eat it.</v>

1619
01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:59.410
<v Speaker 3>If you do eat meat just to experience it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean that's just killing</v>

1620
01:05:59.411 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to actually go out and hunt</v>

1621
01:06:01.601 --> 01:06:06.520
<v Speaker 3>something down and kill it and eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think would would open up a lot of of</v>

1622
01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:10.870
<v Speaker 3>doors inside your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your your mind open up a lot of areas of</v>

1623
01:06:10.871 --> 01:06:14.110
<v Speaker 3>perception and give you this real</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of what it means to</v>

1624
01:06:14.111 --> 01:06:15.340
<v Speaker 3>consume life.</v>

1625
01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.510
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1626
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:17.470
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1627
01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:20.740
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very complex thing that's going</v>

1628
01:06:20.741 --> 01:06:23.120
<v Speaker 3>on when you're eating an animal a lot to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1629
01:06:23.121 --> 01:06:25.510
<v Speaker 3>It's like you talked about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>disconnect me and there is a massive</v>

1630
01:06:25.511 --> 01:06:26.560
<v Speaker 3>disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1631
01:06:26.561 --> 01:06:28.300
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's people think just because it's in a</v>

1632
01:06:28.301 --> 01:06:31.180
<v Speaker 3>package at a grocery store in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cellophane with a styrofoam thing</v>

1633
01:06:31.181 --> 01:06:33.400
<v Speaker 3>underneath that is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't come from an animal or something.</v>

1634
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you should almost have to watch.</v>

1635
01:06:36.011 --> 01:06:38.140
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're not going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should almost have to be there</v>

1636
01:06:38.141 --> 01:06:41.170
<v Speaker 3>whether they kill the cow and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>string it up and then cut it on people.</v>

1637
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:42.820
<v Speaker 3>How many people would become vegetarians</v>
<v Speaker 3>at?</v>

1638
01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that whole cow thing that went</v>

1639
01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:47.440
<v Speaker 3>on a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in a slaughter house down</v>

1640
01:06:47.441 --> 01:06:49.450
<v Speaker 3>in southern California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those cows are sick and they're</v>

1641
01:06:49.451 --> 01:06:52.600
<v Speaker 3>falling over and they've got video of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it got out there about the</v>

1642
01:06:52.601 --> 01:06:55.410
<v Speaker 3>processing of meat and all these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>up in arms about it.</v>

1643
01:06:55.410 --> 01:06:57.760
<v Speaker 3>And like that's always been that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1644
01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:01.450
<v Speaker 3>And it just got public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were appalled by it.</v>

1645
01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:06.451
<v Speaker 3>But that's the reality of beef and</v>
<v Speaker 3>industrial food complex versus the</v>

1646
01:07:07.151 --> 01:07:08.350
<v Speaker 3>animals that we hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget.</v>

1647
01:07:08.351 --> 01:07:09.790
<v Speaker 3>I have a great life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1648
01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:11.230
<v Speaker 3>most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the one Brendan,</v>

1649
01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.430
<v Speaker 3>the animal is Brendan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hunt,</v>

1650
01:07:12.431 --> 01:07:14.920
<v Speaker 3>which of the older ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've had a full life and they've had</v>

1651
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:18.740
<v Speaker 3>the opportunity to experience things in</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature and um,</v>

1652
01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:21.760
<v Speaker 3>reproduce and have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1653
01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:25.430
<v Speaker 3>what an animal's life should be like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're a cattle or you know,</v>

1654
01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:30.480
<v Speaker 3>any type of industrial type of a food</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal like chickens or cows or pigs.</v>

1655
01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:32.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that.</v>

1656
01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:34.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like living in a concentration</v>

1657
01:07:34.961 --> 01:07:36.820
<v Speaker 3>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It depends on the situation too.</v>

1658
01:07:36.821 --> 01:07:37.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my,</v>

1659
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:40.420
<v Speaker 3>my wife's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife's father has a big ranch in</v>

1660
01:07:40.421 --> 01:07:43.900
<v Speaker 3>eastern Montana and they raise and</v>
<v Speaker 3>process all their own stuff and you</v>

1661
01:07:43.901 --> 01:07:44.890
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people talking about,</v>

1662
01:07:44.891 --> 01:07:47.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all the beef and meets horrible and</v>

1663
01:07:47.291 --> 01:07:48.660
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1664
01:07:48.661 --> 01:07:49.690
<v Speaker 3>weren't know where I come from.</v>

1665
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:51.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take really good care of those</v>

1666
01:07:51.071 --> 01:07:54.070
<v Speaker 3>animals and it's very important and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't go to the,</v>

1667
01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:55.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the giant stock yards and all,</v>

1668
01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:57.130
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just depends.</v>

1669
01:07:57.131 --> 01:07:59.440
<v Speaker 3>It's all relative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to look at everything as it</v>

1670
01:07:59.441 --> 01:08:00.110
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1671
01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:00.750
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1672
01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:02.680
<v Speaker 3>where did that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least you know where it's more</v>

1673
01:08:02.681 --> 01:08:03.640
<v Speaker 3>connected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1674
01:08:03.641 --> 01:08:06.630
<v Speaker 3>When people hear about grass fed beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the big complaints ago,</v>

1675
01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.810
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so expensive,</v>

1676
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:10.610
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not supposed to be that cheap deet</v>

1677
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:11.800
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1678
01:08:11.801 --> 01:08:13.360
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1679
01:08:13.361 --> 01:08:15.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>state can be so cheap.</v>

1680
01:08:15.651 --> 01:08:16.370
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

1681
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:20.720
<v Speaker 1>You think about the amount of effort</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has to go for you to get this $5</v>

1682
01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:23.540
<v Speaker 1>steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of effort that the animal has</v>

1683
01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:25.220
<v Speaker 1>to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be fed and has to be taken</v>

1684
01:08:25.221 --> 01:08:26.360
<v Speaker 1>care of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It then has to be slaughtered,</v>

1685
01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.040
<v Speaker 1>cut up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>package processed,</v>

1686
01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.100
<v Speaker 1>send to stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on the shelves and then you go and</v>

1687
01:08:31.101 --> 01:08:33.440
<v Speaker 1>buy like what are the prices like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1688
01:08:33.441 --> 01:08:36.620
<v Speaker 1>no shit of yours could try doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you would value it.</v>

1689
01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:37.700
<v Speaker 1>You would realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1690
01:08:37.701 --> 01:08:40.160
<v Speaker 1>this is actually a pretty good deal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all and all the,</v>

1691
01:08:40.161 --> 01:08:42.110
<v Speaker 1>all the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not all the same either.</v>

1692
01:08:42.111 --> 01:08:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's lots of great ranchers</v>

1693
01:08:44.181 --> 01:08:45.890
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that care about what they're doing and</v>

1694
01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:47.450
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do it right and all that stuff.</v>

1695
01:08:47.451 --> 01:08:48.380
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1696
01:08:48.381 --> 01:08:49.760
<v Speaker 1>you lowest common denominator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get,</v>

1697
01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:52.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place that's got 70 cows packed into</v>

1698
01:08:52.731 --> 01:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>one shoot and people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1699
01:08:55.011 --> 01:08:55.820
<v Speaker 1>we're up in arms about it.</v>

1700
01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:56.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not,</v>

1701
01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:58.760
<v Speaker 1>that's not the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything either.</v>

1702
01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people were being aware of this.</v>

1703
01:09:00.891 --> 01:09:04.100
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's good that people are up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in arms because I think there is</v>

1704
01:09:04.101 --> 01:09:06.260
<v Speaker 1>something really disgusting about</v>
<v Speaker 1>factory farming.</v>

1705
01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Undeniably disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the education of people and</v>

1706
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:11.780
<v Speaker 1>getting to understand like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1707
01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:14.990
<v Speaker 1>this is a system that you're a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even like the really hardcore radical</v>

1708
01:09:14.991 --> 01:09:17.570
<v Speaker 1>animal activists that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk their,</v>

1709
01:09:17.571 --> 01:09:18.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

1710
01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:21.770
<v Speaker 1>their lives and make these crazy fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos and get inside slaughter houses</v>

1711
01:09:21.771 --> 01:09:23.780
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violate those ag gag laws.</v>

1712
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I salute them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw I it too out there.</v>

1713
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it shows the other side of it.</v>

1714
01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:29.693
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

1715
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:31.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad side of it.</v>

1716
01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't get to see it.</v>

1717
01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.940
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't be shielded from the truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any way,</v>

1718
01:09:34.941 --> 01:09:35.630
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

1719
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:39.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed this factory farm system to get</v>

1720
01:09:39.321 --> 01:09:41.630
<v Speaker 1>so disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the fact that people haven't been</v>

1721
01:09:41.631 --> 01:09:44.210
<v Speaker 1>able to have their input.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't been able to see it and</v>

1722
01:09:44.211 --> 01:09:46.070
<v Speaker 1>protest against it and say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1723
01:09:46.071 --> 01:09:46.441
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1724
01:09:46.441 --> 01:09:48.350
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be treating living things</v>

1725
01:09:48.351 --> 01:09:50.420
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally agree.</v>

1726
01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that story doesn't get told enough.</v>

1727
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:57.500
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reasonable people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>love animals and maybe they don't have</v>

1728
01:09:57.501 --> 01:10:00.950
<v Speaker 1>any desire whatsoever to eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that those are the people that I think</v>

1729
01:10:00.951 --> 01:10:03.800
<v Speaker 1>respect the pursuit of hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>

1730
01:10:03.801 --> 01:10:07.100
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you look a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not something for everybody,</v>

1731
01:10:07.101 --> 01:10:09.700
<v Speaker 1>but neither is marathon running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither is weightlifting,</v>

1732
01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:11.450
<v Speaker 1>neither is so true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Football,</v>

1733
01:10:11.451 --> 01:10:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything difficult wrestling these,</v>

1734
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:14.990
<v Speaker 1>this is not for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1735
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:17.180
<v Speaker 1>everybody's not going to do a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are hard to do,</v>

1736
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:21.170
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to procure meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the best way to do it.</v>

1737
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't agree more and everything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes into it.</v>

1738
01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I love about it.</v>

1739
01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Well I think it's important to spread</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1740
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:31.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that's sort of getting out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as the,</v>

1741
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:34.610
<v Speaker 1>there's this anti meat movement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti,</v>

1742
01:10:34.611 --> 01:10:36.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal cruelty movement and I respect</v>

1743
01:10:36.921 --> 01:10:38.180
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand where they're coming from.</v>

1744
01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:41.060
<v Speaker 1>I also thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're driving the lexus with the</v>

1745
01:10:41.061 --> 01:10:44.730
<v Speaker 1>leather seats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean honestly it's like,</v>

1746
01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:45.643
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1747
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:48.560
<v Speaker 1>you see it all the time guy wearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>leather shoes and a leather belt,</v>

1748
01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

1749
01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his impact and how little,</v>

1750
01:10:52.521 --> 01:10:53.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being Vegan or whatever.</v>

1751
01:10:53.811 --> 01:10:54.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1752
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:57.890
<v Speaker 1>that's just the hypocrisy is insane of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1753
01:10:57.891 --> 01:10:58.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like living in a house,</v>

1754
01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:03.200
<v Speaker 1>like how much is animal biproduct from</v>
<v Speaker 1>from everything you use.</v>

1755
01:11:03.201 --> 01:11:04.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

1756
01:11:04.791 --> 01:11:06.170
<v Speaker 1>but I just had a salad today.</v>

1757
01:11:06.170 --> 01:11:10.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean 50 rabbits when the harvest is,</v>

1758
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:13.830
<v Speaker 1>it made you feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in reality you're just bullshitting</v>

1759
01:11:13.831 --> 01:11:14.730
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1760
01:11:14.731 --> 01:11:16.560
<v Speaker 1>But they don't even know they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshitting themselves.</v>

1761
01:11:16.561 --> 01:11:18.930
<v Speaker 1>If they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if their perception of what they're</v>

1762
01:11:18.931 --> 01:11:21.570
<v Speaker 1>doing was accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they would have a good point.</v>

1763
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:24.720
<v Speaker 1>But it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an ignorance to what was actually</v>

1764
01:11:24.721 --> 01:11:25.810
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1765
01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:28.320
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in killing anything.</v>

1766
01:11:28.321 --> 01:11:30.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like every time you get in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>

1767
01:11:30.361 --> 01:11:31.320
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the most animal,</v>

1768
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:34.890
<v Speaker 1>the most life I've ever taken it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time we take a 500 mile road trip</v>

1769
01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:37.200
<v Speaker 1>and I got to wipe those things off my</v>
<v Speaker 1>window.</v>

1770
01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:38.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people,</v>

1771
01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:39.631
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1772
01:11:39.631 --> 01:11:42.220
<v Speaker 1>you can kill the shit out of bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1773
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:43.710
<v Speaker 1>fish or cool or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1774

1775
01:11:45.121 --> 01:11:45.960

<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1776
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.980
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does it work?</v>

1777

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1778
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.080
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to live in boulder and uh,</v>

1779
01:11:50.081 --> 01:11:53.150
<v Speaker 1>I live next to an osh rom and the lady</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ran the Ashram,</v>

1780
01:11:53.151 --> 01:11:55.630

<v Speaker 1>she's to poison the aunt</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's inconvenient.</v>

1785
01:12:02.011 --> 01:12:04.350
<v Speaker 1>We really don't like to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they get in our kitchen and like,</v>

1786
01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:05.950
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1787
01:12:05.951 --> 01:12:07.120
<v Speaker 1>That's where you draw the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1788
01:12:07.121 --> 01:12:09.930
<v Speaker 1>you guys are,</v>

<v Speaker 1>mass where you've killed fucking</v>

1791
01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:20.880
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people like they'll see an ant</v>
<v Speaker 1>on them,</v>

1792
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.720
<v Speaker 1>they'll squish it and then they flick it</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the ground in your house.</v>

1793
01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So little.</v>

01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:29.040
<v Speaker 1>They don't care that it hits your</v>
<v Speaker 1>kitchen floor.</v>

<v Speaker 1>if like someone in your house stopped a</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the True Power of pee right</v>

1831
01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:50.170
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1832
01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:52.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean look at this amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a few of them are going the wrong</v>

1833
01:13:52.711 --> 01:13:56.190
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a few rebels that looks</v>

1834
01:13:56.191 --> 01:13:59.490
<v Speaker 1>like that looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like the freeways is southern</v>

1835
01:13:59.491 --> 01:14:00.030
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

1836
01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:01.470
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

1837
01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really does.</v>

1838
01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:03.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the eye of the storm in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>center there.</v>

1839
01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:06.090
<v Speaker 1>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're circling around and they don't</v>

1840
01:14:06.091 --> 01:14:07.770
<v Speaker 1>know what the fuck is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dead Queen.</v>

1841
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's either a dead queen.</v>

1842
01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if he could find out the actual</v>

1843
01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:15.090
<v Speaker 1>exact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't release any for it.</v>

1844
01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know they're following you</v>

1845
01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:20.200
<v Speaker 1>and some sort of a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when they're doing this,</v>

1846
01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is,</v>

1847
01:14:22.031 --> 01:14:26.560
<v Speaker 1>this is just shows that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this being these a aunts have no,</v>

1848
01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:28.990
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to just find an actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation for it.</v>

1849
01:14:28.991 --> 01:14:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Not a video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when these,</v>

1850
01:14:30.731 --> 01:14:32.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these animals are doing this,</v>

1851
01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:33.910
<v Speaker 1>like they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have any free will they have</v>

1852
01:14:33.911 --> 01:14:34.780
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does this,</v>

1853
01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.540
<v Speaker 1>this sort of directive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what they do.</v>

1854
01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:37.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1855
01:14:37.961 --> 01:14:40.240
<v Speaker 1>they make the nest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they build a beehive,</v>

1856
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:41.590
<v Speaker 1>they do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they change.</v>

1857
01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Like a friend of mine was a Ben O'brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has no band on Brian from a used to</v>

1858
01:14:45.401 --> 01:14:50.401
<v Speaker 1>be worked for Peterson's a fucking 19 he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was telling me about one of his friends</v>

1859
01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:55.560
<v Speaker 1>had a queen bee somehow or they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck in their car and this hive of bees</v>

1860
01:14:56.470 --> 01:15:00.820
<v Speaker 1>followed them for 20 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They followed the car for 20 miles</v>

1861
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:03.100
<v Speaker 1>because the baby was in the car like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1862
01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:04.540
<v Speaker 1>they don't have any like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1863
01:15:04.541 --> 01:15:06.160
<v Speaker 1>she's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we've got to let her go.</v>

1864
01:15:07.050 --> 01:15:10.870
<v Speaker 1>We got to push on because none of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no free will.</v>

1865
01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:11.830
<v Speaker 1>It's just what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1866
01:15:11.831 --> 01:15:13.840
<v Speaker 1>There's no decision making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just what they do.</v>

1867
01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:16.240
<v Speaker 1>The cuisine that we follow her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never give up.</v>

1868
01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:22.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a bizarre form of life and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have these really weird things that they</v>

1869
01:15:22.301 --> 01:15:23.240
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've seen like,</v>

1870
01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:28.480
<v Speaker 1>like videos on different ant species</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the females will chop the males</v>

1871
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.260
<v Speaker 1>legs off I think is that leaf cutter</v>
<v Speaker 1>ants to do that.</v>

1872
01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:33.850
<v Speaker 1>I forget which one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they chop,</v>

1873
01:15:33.851 --> 01:15:37.000
<v Speaker 1>they take the mail when they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>breed with them and they essentially cut</v>

1874
01:15:37.001 --> 01:15:41.740
<v Speaker 1>his legs off so that he can't move and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they carry him to wherever they</v>

1875
01:15:41.741 --> 01:15:43.900
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to fuck him and then they take</v>

1876
01:15:43.901 --> 01:15:47.640
<v Speaker 1>him and breed with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met a couple of girls like that in</v>

1877
01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:50.080
<v Speaker 1>a bad way to go about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>

1878
01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:53.920
<v Speaker 1>like the lion there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stub.</v>

1879
01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.590
<v Speaker 1>All the [inaudible] will come out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1880
01:15:59.270 --> 01:16:01.300
<v Speaker 1>but and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no thought process.</v>

1881
01:16:01.301 --> 01:16:03.580
<v Speaker 1>There is no meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a board where they sit</v>

1882
01:16:03.581 --> 01:16:06.250
<v Speaker 1>down and decide how to do this with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mail.</v>

1883
01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:08.350
<v Speaker 1>They just go about the way they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>always done it.</v>

1884
01:16:08.351 --> 01:16:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a trip,</v>

1885
01:16:09.341 --> 01:16:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1886
01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to make ants commit suicide going to</v>

1887
01:16:13.811 --> 01:16:17.890
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make it happen to a potted plant</v>

1888
01:16:17.891 --> 01:16:20.460
<v Speaker 1>and they'll just start following each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and next thing you know,</v>

1889
01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:22.240
<v Speaker 1>see what we should bring all down on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1890
01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.790
<v Speaker 1>We could put one right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be rude and people would be angry.</v>

1891
01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Did protest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cruel.</v>

1892
01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:30.370
<v Speaker 1>But that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like certain amount of death is okay.</v>

1893
01:16:30.371 --> 01:16:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean every time you wash your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're killing flora,</v>

1894
01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:36.370
<v Speaker 1>you're killing the living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living organisms that are on the surface</v>

1895
01:16:36.371 --> 01:16:38.170
<v Speaker 1>of your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no getting around it.</v>

1896
01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:42.490
<v Speaker 1>And there's no way to live a life where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not killing other life.</v>

1897
01:16:42.491 --> 01:16:44.830
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this constant cycle that's going</v>

1898
01:16:44.831 --> 01:16:49.480
<v Speaker 1>on in some sort of a weird way that most</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us are detached from way.</v>

1899
01:16:49.481 --> 01:16:53.710
<v Speaker 1>It's always been bizarre not to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch with it and or just to deny it.</v>

1900
01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:55.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh I'm not,</v>

1901
01:16:55.301 --> 01:16:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>

1902
01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are like,</v>

1903
01:16:58.811 --> 01:17:00.200
<v Speaker 1>there are a few people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1904
01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:03.760
<v Speaker 1>try as hard as they can and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most people like they don't give up</v>

1905
01:17:03.761 --> 01:17:04.090
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1906
01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:05.700
<v Speaker 1>They love the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1907
01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:09.770
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>implementation is where it complicated I</v>

1908
01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.630
<v Speaker 1>think is also a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment,</v>

1909
01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:14.990
<v Speaker 1>like the anthropomorphizing of animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Disney movies and things along those</v>

1910
01:17:14.991 --> 01:17:17.330
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like when you think of an animal,</v>

1911
01:17:17.331 --> 01:17:19.670
<v Speaker 1>you think of this big ferry lovable</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1912
01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:23.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't think of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like with an alk is essentially</v>

1913
01:17:23.001 --> 01:17:27.020
<v Speaker 1>a warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this living warrior that has a</v>

1914
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:30.140
<v Speaker 1>weapons grown out of its head and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>run around the kill each other.</v>

1915
01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:31.470
<v Speaker 1>When I was at the home ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1916
01:17:31.471 --> 01:17:35.750
<v Speaker 1>you've been to that place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found this huge like three 90 class</v>

1917
01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:39.230
<v Speaker 1>bowl dead that had been stabbed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>another bowl.</v>

1918
01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:43.580
<v Speaker 1>It just random through and he was lying</v>
<v Speaker 1>there dead on the side of the mountain</v>

1919
01:17:43.581 --> 01:17:45.780
<v Speaker 1>with holes in his body from the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowl.</v>

1920
01:17:45.781 --> 01:17:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking headbutted him to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going through it right now.</v>

1921
01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I've got a four year old son and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched this little show called the lion</v>

1922
01:17:52.641 --> 01:17:55.400
<v Speaker 1>guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like in all these animals get</v>

1923
01:17:55.401 --> 01:17:58.040
<v Speaker 1>together and they're all friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we started watching,</v>

1924
01:17:58.041 --> 01:18:00.350
<v Speaker 1>he would ask questions and stuff and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm like,</v>

1925
01:18:00.351 --> 01:18:01.360
<v Speaker 1>we watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1926
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:02.960
<v Speaker 1>if you want to watch the lion guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

1927
01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:07.340
<v Speaker 1>But I've explained to them like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cheetah and the lion and the hippo,</v>

1928
01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:09.230
<v Speaker 1>they don't get along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not buddies.</v>

1929
01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.960
<v Speaker 1>And we watch discovery channel and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched it.</v>

1930
01:18:11.961 --> 01:18:15.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the other day we just watched the</v>

1931
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:16.940
<v Speaker 1>willdabeast couple of days ago we</v>
<v Speaker 1>pitched the willdabeast getting eaten by</v>

1932
01:18:16.941 --> 01:18:19.670
<v Speaker 1>the crocodile and he was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1933
01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:20.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1934
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:21.860
<v Speaker 1>and now like when it comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1935
01:18:21.861 --> 01:18:24.010
<v Speaker 1>well that's just pretend but I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch that.</v>

1936
01:18:24.011 --> 01:18:24.741
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

1937
01:18:24.741 --> 01:18:25.980
<v Speaker 1>As long as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1938
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:27.680
<v Speaker 1>that's not really how it goes.</v>

1939
01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go discovery channel and watch you</v>

1940
01:18:29.421 --> 01:18:31.040
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killers on the savannah and you know,</v>

1941
01:18:31.041 --> 01:18:31.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1942
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:34.940
<v Speaker 1>the line doesn't get along with anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He eats everybody and you know,</v>

1943
01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:38.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my kid to to think that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1944
01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:42.110
<v Speaker 1>oh it's just big peaceful thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all symbiotic relationship and</v>

1945
01:18:42.111 --> 01:18:43.670
<v Speaker 1>they all love each other now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1946
01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:46.760
<v Speaker 1>that ain't what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird the way we've chosen to</v>

1947
01:18:46.761 --> 01:18:50.150
<v Speaker 1>distort these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like polar bears,</v>

1948
01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:52.490
<v Speaker 1>like there was a picture that was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on in instagram.</v>

1949
01:18:52.730 --> 01:18:56.210
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were posting up of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous polar bear walking around with</v>

1950
01:18:56.211 --> 01:18:59.390
<v Speaker 1>a cubs head and its mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got everyday occurrence,</v>

1951
01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:03.380
<v Speaker 1>they're cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100% of the males are cannibals and most</v>

1952
01:19:03.381 --> 01:19:06.590
<v Speaker 1>people have no idea this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they think of a polar Baylor Klondike</v>

1953
01:19:06.591 --> 01:19:08.650
<v Speaker 1>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cocacola salesperson.</v>

1954
01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:09.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1955
01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:13.100
<v Speaker 1>There's the photo that's been going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is just food for them.</v>

1956
01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:13.911
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1957
01:19:13.911 --> 01:19:15.620
<v Speaker 1>in a polar bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not an omnivore.</v>

1958
01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:18.470
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100% people.</v>

1959
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:20.150
<v Speaker 1>He's whatever he can get ahold of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1960
01:19:20.151 --> 01:19:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all they eat is meat.</v>

1961
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:24.620
<v Speaker 1>They're not like a black bear or any</v>
<v Speaker 1>other bear that can eat anything.</v>

1962
01:19:24.690 --> 01:19:28.460
<v Speaker 1>All they need is flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that bear at the zoo is eaten</v>

1963
01:19:28.461 --> 01:19:29.300
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1964
01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:30.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't let you see it,</v>

1965
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:33.500
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the polar bear at the zoo just hammering</v>

1966
01:19:33.501 --> 01:19:34.250
<v Speaker 1>away at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1967
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:36.260
<v Speaker 1>they all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the darker things about</v>

1968
01:19:36.261 --> 01:19:38.450
<v Speaker 1>the zoo too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we take them away from their actual</v>

1969
01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:40.310
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're going to have a zoo,</v>

1970
01:19:40.311 --> 01:19:43.070
<v Speaker 1>which he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have animals that if you ever</v>

1971
01:19:43.071 --> 01:19:47.750
<v Speaker 1>see that zoo in Iraq that they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we invaded Iraq,</v>

1972
01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:51.320
<v Speaker 1>they um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had zoos where they used to just</v>

1973
01:19:51.321 --> 01:19:55.460
<v Speaker 1>let like a goat loose and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would open up the gate and let the lions</v>

1974
01:19:55.461 --> 01:20:00.461
<v Speaker 1>come out and Jack the goat and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers took videos of these things and</v>

1975
01:20:01.191 --> 01:20:02.810
<v Speaker 1>people were like aghast.</v>

1976
01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't understand why you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to keep a lion but</v>

1977
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:10.140
<v Speaker 1>don't let ally and to be lion like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do all the killing.</v>

1978
01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Has you giving him some fake meat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1979
01:20:12.961 --> 01:20:14.160
<v Speaker 1>You giving them real meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1980
01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:18.000
<v Speaker 1>so something had to die in order to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want him to do it.</v>

1981
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you want him to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck are you doing?</v>

1982
01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:21.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1983
01:20:21.841 --> 01:20:22.800
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the zoo?</v>

1984
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the line wants to hear.</v>

1985
01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they live for.</v>

1986
01:20:25.411 --> 01:20:25.770
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1987
01:20:25.770 --> 01:20:28.980
<v Speaker 1>here's the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have these goats and these goats</v>

1988
01:20:28.981 --> 01:20:31.200
<v Speaker 1>are just wandering around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea.</v>

1989
01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:34.890
<v Speaker 1>They let them lose and then they open up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gate and when they open up the gate,</v>

1990
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.900
<v Speaker 1>the lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently they do this all the time.</v>

1991
01:20:36.901 --> 01:20:40.320
<v Speaker 1>So they're hip to what's going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're stretched out and ready to go.</v>

1992
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tape it to it spreads.</v>

1993
01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:46.230
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to pull a Hammy when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get the goat.</v>

1994
01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:50.550
<v Speaker 1>So they open up the gate and as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they open up the gate is just on like</v>

1995
01:20:50.551 --> 01:20:53.670
<v Speaker 1>donkey Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet they got walk out music and</v>

1996
01:20:53.671 --> 01:20:55.060
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just ready.</v>

1997
01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

1998
01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.230
<v Speaker 1>This queen is playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will,</v>

1999
01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:03.420
<v Speaker 1>we will rock you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2000
01:21:03.421 --> 01:21:05.190
<v Speaker 1>it goes boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They open up the gate.</v>

2001
01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that weird to be fascinated by</v>

2002
01:21:13.291 --> 01:21:14.820
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for those guys to look at that and</v>

2003
01:21:14.821 --> 01:21:15.211
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2004
01:21:15.211 --> 01:21:15.751
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2005
01:21:15.751 --> 01:21:17.550
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's lions being lions like that's</v>

2006
01:21:17.551 --> 01:21:19.350
<v Speaker 1>pretty well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're going to eat today one</v>

2007
01:21:19.351 --> 01:21:21.330
<v Speaker 1>way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's another interesting thing.</v>

2008
01:21:21.331 --> 01:21:25.090
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting for us to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're watching and we're going Whoa,</v>

2009
01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:26.580
<v Speaker 1>and were laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

2010
01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:28.380
<v Speaker 1>But if we were there and we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing,</v>

2011
01:21:28.381 --> 01:21:30.870
<v Speaker 1>then people get upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's an instinct to like,</v>

2012
01:21:30.871 --> 01:21:34.290
<v Speaker 1>listen to those guys laughing while it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening because they're filming it</v>

2013
01:21:34.291 --> 01:21:35.940
<v Speaker 1>right through the fence and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2014
01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:38.430
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of assholes laughing at death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile,</v>

2015
01:21:38.431 --> 01:21:40.380
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to laugh at if it's on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube video,</v>

2016
01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.900
<v Speaker 1>it's totally their kid to throw a bug in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2017
01:21:43.930 --> 01:21:45.840
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a tank and,</v>

2018
01:21:45.841 --> 01:21:46.950
<v Speaker 1>and watch a fish eat it.</v>

2019
01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:47.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2020
01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:48.593
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2021
01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.310
<v Speaker 1>But it's like a goat and a lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2022
01:21:50.311 --> 01:21:51.121
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

2023
01:21:51.121 --> 01:21:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like watching a fight.</v>

2024
01:21:53.190 --> 01:21:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2025
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:56.120
<v Speaker 1>we want to see the guy get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2026
01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Next step is death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2027
01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.060
<v Speaker 1>It don't take it as close as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2028
01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find thrilling that,</v>

2029
01:22:01.770 --> 01:22:03.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy chokes the guy out and he stops</v>

2030
01:22:03.421 --> 01:22:05.700
<v Speaker 1>off of him and he's totally unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only difference between that and</v>

2031
01:22:05.701 --> 01:22:07.910
<v Speaker 1>death is time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of time really has a chunk.</v>

2032
01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.290
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2033
01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Keep that choke on for another minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's dead.</v>

2034
01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:12.121
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2035
01:22:12.121 --> 01:22:14.160
<v Speaker 1>or not even a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we get millions of people that want</v>

2036
01:22:14.161 --> 01:22:14.994
<v Speaker 1>to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2037
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:17.460
<v Speaker 1>But at least that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make a decision.</v>

2038
01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:19.650
<v Speaker 1>They both make a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both going to enter into this</v>

2039
01:22:19.651 --> 01:22:24.090
<v Speaker 1>and it's an extreme form of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition with dire physical</v>

2040
01:22:24.091 --> 01:22:24.780
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

2041
01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:26.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's so exciting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

2042
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:29.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the parallels when you're</v>

2043
01:22:29.491 --> 01:22:32.040
<v Speaker 1>watching something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a little different.</v>

2044
01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.760
<v Speaker 1>A little different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still sad.</v>

2045
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:35.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a detachment thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2046
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:36.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2047
01:22:36.150 --> 01:22:36.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2048
01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:39.990
<v Speaker 1>we watch a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can watch a movie where 10 people</v>

2049
01:22:39.991 --> 01:22:42.150
<v Speaker 1>get shot and they get punched and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked.</v>

2050
01:22:42.151 --> 01:22:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets their ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they fuck,</v>

2051
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:46.860
<v Speaker 1>if they're naked and they start to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you showing me?</v>

2052
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.620
<v Speaker 1>What is this like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are weird.</v>

2053
01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.810
<v Speaker 1>We're real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to draw the line on certain</v>

2054
01:22:51.811 --> 01:22:54.540
<v Speaker 1>things for whatever reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense whatsoever.</v>

2055
01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:55.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

2056
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:56.930
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we're the Huntington.</v>

2057
01:22:56.970 --> 01:22:58.240
<v Speaker 1>You can't win it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2058
01:22:58.290 --> 01:22:58.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2059
01:22:58.571 --> 01:23:00.640
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do as good a job as you can and</v>

2060
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:03.170
<v Speaker 1>putting forward at an educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2061
01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:05.730
<v Speaker 1>opinion of why we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2062
01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:06.030
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2063
01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:08.500
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and at the same time being,</v>

2064
01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:10.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where I'm unapologetic about it too.</v>

2065
01:23:10.901 --> 01:23:13.030
<v Speaker 4>It's not like so many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's not a conversation that could</v>

2066
01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:16.030
<v Speaker 4>convince me that what I'm doing isn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I was meant to do,</v>

2067
01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:17.431
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2068
01:23:17.431 --> 01:23:18.850
<v Speaker 4>When it comes to hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2069
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:19.380
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2070
01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:20.890
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put forward,</v>

2071
01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:22.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we try and tell people about it and</v>

2072
01:23:23.050 --> 01:23:25.590
<v Speaker 4>educate people as to what it is and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are gonna feel how they're gonna</v>

2073
01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:27.160
<v Speaker 4>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at the end of the day,</v>

2074
01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:29.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing's going to change with us</v>

2075
01:23:29.651 --> 01:23:32.200
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did you go from being a guy who is</v>

2076
01:23:32.201 --> 01:23:35.650
<v Speaker 4>obsessed with being the best hunter you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could possibly be and wanting to be the</v>

2077
01:23:35.651 --> 01:23:38.470
<v Speaker 4>best hunter in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How'd you go from that to working for a</v>

2078
01:23:38.471 --> 01:23:40.720
<v Speaker 4>Sitka and apparel company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hunting company,</v>

2079
01:23:40.721 --> 01:23:42.910
<v Speaker 4>and then going to kill you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2081
01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.030

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of guys that get</v>

2087
01:23:54.761 --> 01:23:58.180
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden they killed one big</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing or they win one small lottery or</v>

<v Speaker 4>writing.</v>

2105
01:24:30.221 --> 01:24:32.090
<v Speaker 4>I was at a trade show when I met him and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2106
01:24:32.091 --> 01:24:33.850
<v Speaker 4>I didn't work at sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a first,</v>

2107
01:24:33.851 --> 01:24:35.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had an athlete team and one of the</v>

2108
01:24:35.561 --> 01:24:38.620
<v Speaker 4>first for first year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not really an athlete team.</v>

2109
01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:39.301
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

2110
01:24:39.301 --> 01:24:42.580
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever pro staff we were talking about</v>

2111
01:24:42.581 --> 01:24:43.360
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the phone and it's,</v>

2112
01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:47.260
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird term today because of this</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of buy a hat that says like pro</v>

2113
01:24:47.261 --> 01:24:49.840
<v Speaker 4>staff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The franchise is completely dead.</v>

2114
01:24:49.841 --> 01:24:52.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pro staff with everything.</v>

2115
01:24:52.601 --> 01:24:54.620
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you can buy a hat that</v>
<v Speaker 4>says that it's,</v>

2116
01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:55.860
<v Speaker 4>it's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it means,</v>

2117
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.890
<v Speaker 4>it means nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2118
01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:00.490
<v Speaker 4>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but back in the day it was,</v>

2119
01:25:00.491 --> 01:25:05.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean went back when print media and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like at one point in time it meant you</v>

2120
01:25:05.201 --> 01:25:09.220
<v Speaker 4>were vouching for our product because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you used it and isn't the right to vouch</v>

2121
01:25:09.221 --> 01:25:10.054
<v Speaker 4>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2122
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:13.600
<v Speaker 4>You had a can have the photos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have the accomplishments,</v>

2123
01:25:13.601 --> 01:25:15.400
<v Speaker 4>you've earned the right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not so much today,</v>

2124
01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:19.120
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have the credibility to say this is,</v>

2125
01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:22.540
<v Speaker 4>this is good stuff or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And not because you did social media</v>

2126
01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:24.220
<v Speaker 4>reps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because you actually had been out</v>

2127
01:25:24.221 --> 01:25:26.020
<v Speaker 4>there using it and you don't have big</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

2128
01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:26.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And had the,</v>

2129
01:25:26.981 --> 01:25:30.160
<v Speaker 4>had the track record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I met him at a trade show and uh,</v>

2130
01:25:30.190 --> 01:25:31.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

2131
01:25:31.330 --> 01:25:34.270
<v Speaker 4>every now and again in life you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's just right place at the</v>

2132
01:25:34.271 --> 01:25:36.070
<v Speaker 4>right time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had killed that big elk and it</v>

2133
01:25:36.071 --> 01:25:39.190
<v Speaker 4>kind of was getting known and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I met him in the booth and he's</v>

2134
01:25:39.191 --> 01:25:40.720
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're that kid that killed that big elk</v>

2135

<v Speaker 4>helping them test and gear and shot a</v>
<v Speaker 4>commercial for him down and stuff.</v>

2138
01:25:48.161 --> 01:25:49.840
<v Speaker 4>And we just became really good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

2139
01:25:50.250 --> 01:25:52.150
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2158
01:26:22.941 --> 01:26:24.830
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's hit everything on the head that he</v>

2159
01:26:24.831 --> 01:26:25.451
<v Speaker 4>told me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2163
01:26:29.001 --> 01:26:30.610
<v Speaker 4>November or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a year before he's,</v>

2164
01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.170
<v Speaker 4>could you start at Ku?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was already started,</v>

2165
01:26:33.171 --> 01:26:34.670
<v Speaker 4>but beforehand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>

<v Speaker 4>a carbon fiber frame and he's like,</v>

2171
01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:48.320
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the backpack we're coming out</v>

2172
01:26:48.321 --> 01:26:50.870
<v Speaker 4>with and the whole business model,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of that.</v>

2173
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:52.940
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not the smartest guy in the world,</v>

2174
01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:55.760
<v Speaker 4>but when I meet a really smart dude</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's got a really good idea,</v>

2175
01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:57.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not that dumb.</v>

2176
01:26:59.070 --> 01:27:00.950
<v Speaker 4>You smart enough to recognize smart</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2177
01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:01.891
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2178
01:27:01.891 --> 01:27:02.391
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean you,</v>

2181
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:07.730
<v Speaker 4>when you see something and you go to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to know more about that and that</v>

2182
01:27:07.731 --> 01:27:10.280
<v Speaker 4>seems like it's going to fix a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2183

<v Speaker 4>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2189
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:23.600
<v Speaker 4>You're testing gear and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I mean,</v>

01:27:23.601 --> 01:27:26.450
<v Speaker 4>truly live in the dream and not just</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying it like living the dream.</v>

2191
01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:29.030
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't wake up every day and you like</v>

2192
01:27:29.031 --> 01:27:31.210
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2193
01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:32.330
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been awesome.</v>

2194
01:27:32.331 --> 01:27:32.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2195
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.801
<v Speaker 4>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>

2196
01:27:33.801 --> 01:27:37.370
<v Speaker 4>he said he's been basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking for somebody to run this</v>

2197
01:27:37.371 --> 01:27:39.980
<v Speaker 4>part of it and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

2198
01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:41.540
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd be perfect.</v>

2199
01:27:41.541 --> 01:27:42.374
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2200
01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.870
<v Speaker 4>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I think people like you were</v>

2201
01:27:44.871 --> 01:27:46.910
<v Speaker 4>attracted to the pursuit of excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2202
01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:49.000
<v Speaker 4>And when you see the pursuit of</v>
<v Speaker 4>excellence in,</v>

2203
01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.180
<v Speaker 4>in another form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

2204
01:27:50.181 --> 01:27:50.960
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there it is.</v>

2205
01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:51.330
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2206
01:27:51.330 --> 01:27:55.040
<v Speaker 4>that's how it is with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I started seeing your company and I</v>

2207
01:27:55.041 --> 01:27:59.570
<v Speaker 4>see a company that's trying to like</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeply and seriously engineer something,</v>

2208
01:27:59.571 --> 01:28:01.970
<v Speaker 4>I Geek out on shit that I'm not even</v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in buying.</v>

2209
01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:05.990
<v Speaker 4>Like if someone's making the craziest</v>
<v Speaker 4>grandfather clock in the world and I see</v>

2210
01:28:05.991 --> 01:28:07.610
<v Speaker 4>this guy that's engineering these</v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

2211
01:28:07.611 --> 01:28:12.200
<v Speaker 4>so it's accurate to like one 18th of one</v>
<v Speaker 4>second over 20 years,</v>

2212
01:28:12.201 --> 01:28:13.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

2213
01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.950
<v Speaker 4>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to know what's going on this</v>

2214
01:28:15.951 --> 01:28:19.220
<v Speaker 4>dude's brain that makes them want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make this unbelievable grandfather</v>

2215
01:28:19.221 --> 01:28:19.560
<v Speaker 4>clock.</v>

2216
01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.180
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2217
01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:22.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated by pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2218
01:28:22.971 --> 01:28:25.510
<v Speaker 4>when someone's trying to do something</v>
<v Speaker 4>better than the people that had done</v>

2219
01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:27.470
<v Speaker 4>before it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated by that.</v>

2220
01:28:27.471 --> 01:28:32.471
<v Speaker 4>So he must've seen that for a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I know what I know what I like</v>

2221
01:28:33.831 --> 01:28:36.560
<v Speaker 4>and I know what I see a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2222
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:37.880
<v Speaker 4>the one thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

2223
01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:42.320
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say I'm necessarily the best</v>
<v Speaker 4>at doing like super intricate things are</v>

2224
01:28:42.321 --> 01:28:45.200
<v Speaker 4>knowing exactly how to get there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you see somebody that knows how</v>

2225
01:28:45.201 --> 01:28:47.630
<v Speaker 4>to get there and like it'd be a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>combination and you can,</v>

2226
01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:50.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>assist in that in somebody that when</v>

2227
01:28:50.361 --> 01:28:51.570
<v Speaker 4>they're headed on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the,</v>

2228
01:28:51.571 --> 01:28:53.000
<v Speaker 4>on the right direction and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2229
01:28:53.210 --> 01:28:54.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm down with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2230
01:28:54.230 --> 01:28:55.430
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

2231
01:28:55.450 --> 01:28:57.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have my input on what we do,</v>

2232
01:28:57.561 --> 01:28:58.940
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the end of the day it's,</v>

2233
01:28:58.970 --> 01:29:00.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it is,</v>

2234
01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:01.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

2235
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 4>how he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how he goes</v>

2236
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.390
<v Speaker 1>about stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool to watch.</v>

2237
01:29:03.391 --> 01:29:03.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2238
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:04.783
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2239
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always tell people like at,</v>

2240
01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:10.230
<v Speaker 1>at what we do is it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly what you think it is.</v>

2241
01:29:10.231 --> 01:29:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Like there's not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you step in the room and it's like,</v>

2242
01:29:12.361 --> 01:29:13.890
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is some other guy's stuff.</v>

2243
01:29:13.891 --> 01:29:15.660
<v Speaker 1>We're going to knock this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not going on.</v>

2244
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:17.490
<v Speaker 1>But that does happen in some companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

2245
01:29:17.491 --> 01:29:21.440
<v Speaker 1>you were posting all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's disturbing to me.</v>

2246
01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:25.050
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the future of this,</v>

2247
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:27.780
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far can you keep pushing this?</v>

2248
01:29:27.781 --> 01:29:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a fairly new thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been like ridiculously</v>

2249
01:29:31.921 --> 01:29:34.530
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and outdoor equipment and</v>

2250
01:29:34.710 --> 01:29:39.710
<v Speaker 1>obviously exists in the mountaineering</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and the Rei wise and you know,</v>

2251
01:29:39.721 --> 01:29:41.910
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try every year trying to come up</v>

2252
01:29:41.911 --> 01:29:43.530
<v Speaker 1>with better and better stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how,</v>

2253
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:45.930
<v Speaker 1>how far can that go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is there a point where you're going</v>

2254
01:29:45.931 --> 01:29:49.230
<v Speaker 1>to have it done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is the best backpack anybody</v>

2255
01:29:49.231 --> 01:29:51.210
<v Speaker 1>could ever possibly make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the best clothes.</v>

2256
01:29:51.211 --> 01:29:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a,</v>

2257
01:29:53.131 --> 01:29:55.080
<v Speaker 1>is there a point where that ends?</v>

2258
01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:58.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today innovation is happening faster</v>

2259
01:29:58.821 --> 01:30:03.821
<v Speaker 2>than ever has and with those business</v>
<v Speaker 2>model we can implement those innovations</v>

2260
01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:07.670
<v Speaker 2>quickly and we're always looking for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next greatest thing.</v>

2261
01:30:07.671 --> 01:30:08.600
<v Speaker 2>I always am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2262
01:30:08.601 --> 01:30:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I searched the globe on a continuous</v>
<v Speaker 2>basis for what's new,</v>

2263
01:30:12.021 --> 01:30:15.290
<v Speaker 2>what's next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aligned myself with the innovation</v>

2264
01:30:15.291 --> 01:30:17.870
<v Speaker 2>leaders for every single category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's marina wool,</v>

2265
01:30:17.871 --> 01:30:21.500
<v Speaker 2>whether it's leathers or whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>for our gloves or whether it's carbon</v>

2266
01:30:21.501 --> 01:30:23.480
<v Speaker 2>fiber for our bat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our packs.</v>

2267
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had our designer down at Stanford,</v>

2268
01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:29.330
<v Speaker 2>the carbon fiber scientists down there</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's working on some leading edge</v>

2269
01:30:29.331 --> 01:30:32.630
<v Speaker 2>technologies around carbon fiber that</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't even get to market for a few</v>

2270
01:30:32.630 --> 01:30:34.700
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were that interested in seeing what's</v>

2271
01:30:34.701 --> 01:30:38.420
<v Speaker 2>next because we can implement it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have no price restrictions.</v>

2272
01:30:38.421 --> 01:30:40.600
<v Speaker 2>When we take it away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's for us,</v>

2273
01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:42.730
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a never ending pursuit and there's</v>

2274
01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:46.390
<v Speaker 2>always new ways to make things and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>why I tagged,</v>

2275
01:30:46.690 --> 01:30:48.790
<v Speaker 2>tagged the line for the business of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultra light.</v>

2276
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:53.270
<v Speaker 2>Because if I can find a way to shave an</v>
<v Speaker 2>ounce or a gram,</v>

2277
01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:57.550
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason to redo that product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's reason to reinvent that product</v>

2278
01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:02.580
<v Speaker 2>because that makes a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was my focus with this is that,</v>

2279
01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:04.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tory's technology and how they make the</v>

2280
01:31:04.571 --> 01:31:06.790
<v Speaker 2>yarn carbon fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all led to ultra light.</v>

2281
01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Ultra light means performance in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains.</v>

2282
01:31:09.041 --> 01:31:13.120
<v Speaker 2>And so my goal is to get our weights</v>
<v Speaker 2>continuously to come down as far as our</v>

2283
01:31:13.121 --> 01:31:16.510
<v Speaker 2>product without giving up performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's through using really</v>

2284
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:20.110
<v Speaker 2>innovative technologies and designs that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are all focused around that.</v>

2285
01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:23.110
<v Speaker 2>And I mean from where we started to</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we are now,</v>

2286
01:31:23.111 --> 01:31:26.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've taken pounds and pounds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight out of people's kits and packs</v>

2287
01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:30.430
<v Speaker 2>and seeing the results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's been amazing to watch people</v>

2288
01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:33.400
<v Speaker 2>that normally would walk into the mounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the 70 pound back now leaving with</v>

2289
01:31:33.401 --> 01:31:36.340
<v Speaker 2>a 40 pound pack and come back and sand</v>
<v Speaker 2>made all the difference in the world.</v>

2290
01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I can hunt now and I thought I was done</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of pack weight.</v>

2291
01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Now have you guys thought about</v>
<v Speaker 1>implementing any sort of a workout</v>

2292
01:31:45.441 --> 01:31:49.250
<v Speaker 1>routines or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or diet routines or things like that on</v>

2293
01:31:49.251 --> 01:31:54.251
<v Speaker 1>your website and it's sort of shaping</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's ideas about getting your body</v>

2294
01:31:54.291 --> 01:31:55.700
<v Speaker 1>prepared?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to do more of that,</v>

2295
01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:56.850
<v Speaker 2>really would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2296
01:31:56.890 --> 01:31:59.830
<v Speaker 2>we'd started developing our mountain fit</v>
<v Speaker 2>line come out next year.</v>

2297
01:31:59.831 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2298
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:03.640
<v Speaker 4>using all of our fabric innovations into</v>
<v Speaker 4>performance fitness line for our</v>

2299
01:32:03.641 --> 01:32:07.120
<v Speaker 4>customer because they're all training</v>
<v Speaker 4>for hunts and I have wanted to step in</v>

2300
01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:11.830
<v Speaker 4>and help people get fit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrition supplements and bring that to</v>

2301
01:32:11.831 --> 01:32:13.810
<v Speaker 4>our customers as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just haven't gotten there yet,</v>

2302
01:32:14.290 --> 01:32:17.110
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's absolutely something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I want to do it cause I live and</v>

2303
01:32:17.111 --> 01:32:18.550
<v Speaker 4>breathe it everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just haven't done it yet.</v>

2304
01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:21.010
<v Speaker 4>Don't you think that's also another</v>
<v Speaker 4>aspect that people don't realize,</v>

2305
01:32:21.011 --> 01:32:24.970
<v Speaker 4>like how much physical requirement is</v>
<v Speaker 4>necessary in order to to hunt.</v>

2306
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.890
<v Speaker 4>Like especially in mountain hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>elk hunting,</v>

2307
01:32:26.891 --> 01:32:28.840
<v Speaker 4>you're going in the mountains of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Montana,</v>

2308
01:32:28.841 --> 01:32:33.841
<v Speaker 4>you're at fucking 9,000 plus elevation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievably difficult on the body.</v>

2309
01:32:34.061 --> 01:32:37.390
<v Speaker 4>And I think most people don't realize</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much physical preparation is</v>

2310
01:32:37.391 --> 01:32:39.430
<v Speaker 4>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially you two guys,</v>

2311
01:32:39.431 --> 01:32:41.920
<v Speaker 4>you wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are former football player,</v>

2312
01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:43.630
<v Speaker 4>you guys have athletic backgrounds.</v>

2313
01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:47.230
<v Speaker 4>You know how physically demanding this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the hardest things I've ever done.</v>

2314
01:32:47.290 --> 01:32:49.540
<v Speaker 4>I've been hunting without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean like,</v>

2315
01:32:50.230 --> 01:32:51.460
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's tough,</v>

2316
01:32:51.461 --> 01:32:54.400
<v Speaker 4>that's stuff that's tougher than college</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling practices.</v>

2317
01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:55.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've definitely,</v>

2318
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you,</v>

2319
01:32:56.561 --> 01:32:57.850
<v Speaker 4>you got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you push it to limit,</v>

2320
01:32:57.851 --> 01:33:00.250
<v Speaker 4>especially on some of these long</v>
<v Speaker 4>expedition consonant.</v>

2321
01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:04.300
<v Speaker 4>I spent 24 days backpacking in the Bob</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marshall last year to find a sheet to</v>

2322
01:33:04.301 --> 01:33:05.680
<v Speaker 4>find one ram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

2323
01:33:06.130 --> 01:33:09.160
<v Speaker 4>until you've actually done that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm talking like it's not just,</v>

2324
01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:11.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how far or how long,</v>

2325
01:33:11.411 --> 01:33:13.600
<v Speaker 4>but it's sustained.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2326
01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:16.600
<v Speaker 4>it's at a sustained high level of focus</v>
<v Speaker 4>also,</v>

2327
01:33:16.601 --> 01:33:17.710
<v Speaker 4>which you don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>

2328
01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:21.820
<v Speaker 4>you can grind away at stuff and you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>just go and go and go.</v>

2329
01:33:21.821 --> 01:33:22.720
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2330
01:33:22.721 --> 01:33:25.060
<v Speaker 4>when we get them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't just go from a to b.</v>

2331
01:33:25.061 --> 01:33:26.530
<v Speaker 4>We have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2332
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:28.990
<v Speaker 4>you have to be on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on point in the mountains too.</v>

2333
01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:30.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be sharp.</v>

2334
01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:32.050
<v Speaker 4>You gotta be ready to execute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The moment comes,</v>

2335
01:33:32.051 --> 01:33:35.020
<v Speaker 4>you can't be just sort of trotting along</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a Zombie.</v>

2336
01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:35.651
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2337
01:33:35.651 --> 01:33:38.740
<v Speaker 4>when you get up early in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're not glass and every single</v>

2338
01:33:38.741 --> 01:33:42.610
<v Speaker 4>time with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the same enthusiasm and the same or</v>

2339
01:33:42.611 --> 01:33:45.970
<v Speaker 4>that your grid system or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be as intense on day one as</v>

2340
01:33:45.971 --> 01:33:48.880
<v Speaker 4>you do on the last day because you could</v>
<v Speaker 4>miss what you're looking for and you</v>

2341
01:33:48.881 --> 01:33:49.840
<v Speaker 4>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't let up.</v>

2342
01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:51.700
<v Speaker 4>That's the beauty of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

2343
01:33:51.701 --> 01:33:53.290
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean physically fit.</v>

2344
01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:54.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of different stuff.</v>

2345
01:33:54.821 --> 01:33:55.654
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

2346
01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:58.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got his whole training regimen and</v>

2347
01:33:58.271 --> 01:33:59.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's different,</v>

2348
01:33:59.291 --> 01:33:59.920
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2349
01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like whether it's yoga or you know,</v>

2350
01:34:02.290 --> 01:34:04.690
<v Speaker 4>cardio and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much you're eating.</v>

2351
01:34:04.691 --> 01:34:05.431
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2352
01:34:05.431 --> 01:34:06.190
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2353
01:34:06.190 --> 01:34:07.340
<v Speaker 4>it never ends you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2354
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:08.800
<v Speaker 4>there is no magic bullet.</v>

2355
01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:09.671
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the puzzle,</v>

2356
01:34:09.671 --> 01:34:11.560
<v Speaker 4>you're always putting it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're always breaking it down and doing</v>

2357
01:34:11.561 --> 01:34:13.280
<v Speaker 4>a new puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2358
01:34:13.290 --> 01:34:15.130
<v Speaker 4>I do every year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2359
01:34:15.131 --> 01:34:17.020
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone has different physical</v>

2360
01:34:17.021 --> 01:34:19.930
<v Speaker 4>requirements is some people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>older and you just trying to kind of</v>

2361
01:34:19.931 --> 01:34:23.050
<v Speaker 4>maintain the best possible shape they</v>
<v Speaker 4>get in.</v>

2362
01:34:23.051 --> 01:34:25.690
<v Speaker 4>There's some guys that are younger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We tried to get them into the ultimate</v>

2363
01:34:25.691 --> 01:34:28.270
<v Speaker 4>fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're training and you're doing</v>

2364
01:34:28.271 --> 01:34:31.120
<v Speaker 4>all these backpack things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you see you carrying weight it</v>

2365
01:34:31.121 --> 01:34:32.620
<v Speaker 4>using weight plates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what do you,</v>

2366
01:34:32.621 --> 01:34:34.300
<v Speaker 4>what are you carrying around in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>backpack?</v>

2367
01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:37.900
<v Speaker 4>So I use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have these sand bags that are set up</v>

2368
01:34:37.901 --> 01:34:41.170
<v Speaker 4>for putting over like the booms and our</v>
<v Speaker 4>video root cause now what I use,</v>

2369
01:34:41.171 --> 01:34:42.850
<v Speaker 4>you can buy them in 20 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>25 pounds,</v>

2370
01:34:42.851 --> 01:34:45.460
<v Speaker 4>30 pound increments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I put in my packet train</v>

2371
01:34:45.461 --> 01:34:47.210
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so like right now as we're rolling,</v>

2372
01:34:47.290 --> 01:34:50.950
<v Speaker 4>we're about 45 days away from are a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sheep hunt in the Yukon.</v>

2373
01:34:51.190 --> 01:34:54.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm really stepping up my weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm training with a 90 pound pack now</v>

2374
01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 4>and I'll do a two or three hour hike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1500 2000 vertical</v>

2375
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.170
<v Speaker 2>feet and on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm doing it in the middle of the</v>

2376
01:35:00.170 --> 01:35:03.380
<v Speaker 2>day with the heat we're having because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it adds another mental toughness factor</v>

2377
01:35:03.381 --> 01:35:03.951
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus,</v>

2378
01:35:03.951 --> 01:35:06.740
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it adds a whole nother level of fitness</v>

2379
01:35:06.741 --> 01:35:10.190
<v Speaker 2>to when you're trained in the heat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my goal is to try to train in</v>

2380
01:35:10.191 --> 01:35:12.890
<v Speaker 2>situations with weight and conditions</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are harder than what I'll</v>

2381
01:35:12.891 --> 01:35:16.660
<v Speaker 2>experience in the hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just for the mental strength as much as</v>

2382
01:35:16.661 --> 01:35:19.850
<v Speaker 2>it as the physical part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you get beat down on day three</v>

2383
01:35:19.851 --> 01:35:23.210
<v Speaker 2>or day four and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a lot of guys just fold in the</v>

2384
01:35:23.211 --> 01:35:27.560
<v Speaker 2>towel and say I've had it more go home</v>
<v Speaker 2>just physically they don't have anything</v>

2385
01:35:27.561 --> 01:35:28.670
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing left.</v>

2386
01:35:28.671 --> 01:35:30.590
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a mental side of it too.</v>

2387
01:35:30.591 --> 01:35:33.710
<v Speaker 2>That's a big part of it that gives me</v>
<v Speaker 2>confidence when I'm going on these trips</v>

2388
01:35:33.711 --> 01:35:34.750
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2389
01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:35.930
<v Speaker 2>they're fricking grinders.</v>

2390
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:39.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've had hunts where we walked</v>
<v Speaker 2>for three freaking straight days with 70</v>

2391
01:35:39.741 --> 01:35:41.630
<v Speaker 2>pound packs before you even start</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>

2392
01:35:41.631 --> 01:35:45.140
<v Speaker 2>That's just to get into the area from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time you wake up until the time you</v>

2393
01:35:45.141 --> 01:35:47.810
<v Speaker 2>go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that can,</v>

2394
01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:50.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people can make the phone sat,</v>

2395
01:35:50.931 --> 01:35:52.370
<v Speaker 2>phone call and get picked up and taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2396
01:35:52.670 --> 01:35:55.100
<v Speaker 2>And we hear about it all the time from</v>
<v Speaker 2>clients and customers.</v>

2397
01:35:55.101 --> 01:35:57.080
<v Speaker 2>So we try to help them get prepared</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower that way.</v>

2398
01:35:57.081 --> 01:35:59.570
<v Speaker 2>So that doesn't happen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're doing something like that</v>

2399
01:35:59.571 --> 01:36:00.770
<v Speaker 2>and you're preparing for something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2400
01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:04.670
<v Speaker 2>do you start off with like 20 pounds and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how do you,</v>

2401
01:36:04.671 --> 01:36:06.560
<v Speaker 2>how do you do then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you advise someone?</v>

2402
01:36:06.561 --> 01:36:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Like say if there's someone listening</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

2403
01:36:08.250 --> 01:36:08.901
<v Speaker 2>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2404
01:36:08.901 --> 01:36:09.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2405
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:11.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go on a hunt this this</v>

2406
01:36:11.421 --> 01:36:12.320
<v Speaker 2>winter or this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2407
01:36:12.321 --> 01:36:14.930
<v Speaker 2>this fall rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I need to really get physically</v>

2408
01:36:14.931 --> 01:36:17.600
<v Speaker 2>prepared but I don't want to blow it all</v>
<v Speaker 2>out in one shot.</v>

2409
01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you definitely want to build up to it.</v>

2410
01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:22.080
<v Speaker 2>And because I don't stop training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come out of a hat on and go right back</v>

2411
01:36:22.081 --> 01:36:24.050
<v Speaker 2>at my training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for a lot of guys are just getting</v>

2412
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:25.430
<v Speaker 2>to ease into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2413
01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:26.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want us,</v>

2414
01:36:26.630 --> 01:36:29.060
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start with 20 pounds and build yourself</v>

2415
01:36:29.061 --> 01:36:32.330
<v Speaker 2>up over time because lastly we want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is go into hunt hurt,</v>

2416
01:36:32.530 --> 01:36:33.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done that before.</v>

2417
01:36:33.411 --> 01:36:37.700
<v Speaker 2>I've overtrained or done too much going</v>
<v Speaker 2>into hunt and you have to be careful,</v>

2418
01:36:37.701 --> 01:36:42.230
<v Speaker 2>especially as you age I get sent tend to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get tendinitis and joint pain more than</v>

2419
01:36:42.231 --> 01:36:43.940
<v Speaker 2>I ever have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>

2420
01:36:43.941 --> 01:36:47.660
<v Speaker 2>it's managing your body through that</v>
<v Speaker 2>process and having something left when</v>

2421
01:36:47.661 --> 01:36:50.900
<v Speaker 2>you leave and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but being fit enough and having your</v>

2422
01:36:50.901 --> 01:36:53.170
<v Speaker 2>feet and in good enough shape and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>boots broken.</v>

2423
01:36:53.171 --> 01:36:57.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot to it besides just</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cardio part of it that goes into the</v>

2424
01:36:57.591 --> 01:36:58.100
<v Speaker 2>hunt.</v>

2425
01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:00.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people would benefit from seeing</v>

2426
01:37:00.670 --> 01:37:02.780
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you could make like a blog on</v>

2427
01:37:02.781 --> 01:37:06.590
<v Speaker 2>how you do it or get outline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally outline how you start off and</v>

2428
01:37:06.591 --> 01:37:10.250
<v Speaker 2>how someone would build into it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe consult with someone who's a,</v>

2429
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:13.480
<v Speaker 2>an expert trainer and figure out what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best way to uh,</v>

2430
01:37:13.730 --> 01:37:18.730
<v Speaker 2>get people prepared to develop an actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>workout for like for pack hunting or for</v>

2431
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.910
<v Speaker 2>even hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any,</v>

2432
01:37:19.911 --> 01:37:22.460
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any sort of thing where you're walking</v>

2433
01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:24.980
<v Speaker 2>uphill in the mountains with weight on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your back.</v>

2434
01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:26.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

2435
01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:29.540
<v Speaker 2>that is an unbelievably difficult thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do all day,</v>

2436
01:37:29.690 --> 01:37:31.730
<v Speaker 2>every day for several days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At a time.</v>

2437
01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:33.830
<v Speaker 2>It's just a different biomechanical</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

2438
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:37.580
<v Speaker 2>I used to trail run a ton beforehand and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was enough and I've gotten older.</v>

2439
01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:41.630
<v Speaker 2>I've realized that I need to train more</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically for hunts and that's</v>

2440
01:37:41.631 --> 01:37:44.810
<v Speaker 2>carrying a pack with weight and it hits</v>
<v Speaker 2>different muscle groups as you've felt.</v>

2441
01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:47.990
<v Speaker 2>It gets more up in your hips and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>glutes and it hits a whole different</v>

2442
01:37:47.991 --> 01:37:50.630
<v Speaker 2>muscle group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then trail riding does or that weight</v>

2443
01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:54.590
<v Speaker 2>training does or training on an</v>
<v Speaker 2>elliptical stairmaster or whatever that</v>

2444
01:37:54.591 --> 01:37:56.190
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no substitute</v>

2445
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:57.390
<v Speaker 3>for spending time in the pack with</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

2446
01:37:57.391 --> 01:37:58.410
<v Speaker 3>There's just isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2447
01:37:58.411 --> 01:38:00.900
<v Speaker 3>there's no sub.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so different than anything else.</v>

2448
01:38:00.901 --> 01:38:02.250
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so exhausting.</v>

2449
01:38:02.370 --> 01:38:06.480
<v Speaker 3>It is and it hits a whole different</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle group and your heart and lungs</v>

2450
01:38:06.481 --> 01:38:08.790
<v Speaker 3>may be in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those muscles aren't and it,</v>

2451
01:38:08.850 --> 01:38:10.110
<v Speaker 3>it taxes you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2452
01:38:10.410 --> 01:38:13.350
<v Speaker 3>As much as I lift weights and workout</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kettlebells and all this stuff,</v>

2453
01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:18.580
<v Speaker 3>I packed hundred pounds for like three</v>
<v Speaker 3>quarters of a mile in the fall and I was</v>

2454
01:38:19.501 --> 01:38:21.810
<v Speaker 3>fucking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know when it was over I was like,</v>

2455
01:38:21.811 --> 01:38:24.630
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can imagine 70 pounds on my back for</v>

2456
01:38:24.631 --> 01:38:27.450
<v Speaker 3>three days at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walking all day just to start hunting.</v>

2457
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:29.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in good enough shape for that.</v>

2458
01:38:29.641 --> 01:38:32.760
<v Speaker 3>So if someone listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a resource,</v>

2459
01:38:32.761 --> 01:38:35.790
<v Speaker 3>is there any like sort of a website they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can go to that give them some good</v>

2460
01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:37.890
<v Speaker 3>workouts for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for something to get prepared for</v>

2461
01:38:38.190 --> 01:38:39.000
<v Speaker 3>something like this?</v>

2462
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.750
<v Speaker 3>There isn't one specific to what we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing and I think it's a great idea that</v>

2463
01:38:42.751 --> 01:38:44.640
<v Speaker 3>you have is really laying that out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we tee,</v>

2464
01:38:44.650 --> 01:38:46.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean we talk about all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we take all this for fricking granted.</v>

2465
01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've grown up doing it right?</v>

2466
01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:49.470
<v Speaker 3>These spreadsheets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are like,</v>

2467
01:38:49.471 --> 01:38:50.490
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so amazing.</v>

2468
01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:52.410
<v Speaker 3>You do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I've always done it right on</v>

2469
01:38:52.411 --> 01:38:53.940
<v Speaker 3>the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You knew what your pack's going away</v>

2470
01:38:54.710 --> 01:38:57.440
<v Speaker 3>when that you're not over packing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have exactly what you need and</v>

2471
01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:00.120
<v Speaker 3>how much you need of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we break it down to like calories</v>

2472
01:39:00.121 --> 01:39:03.870
<v Speaker 3>per ounce and ounces per day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as our food.</v>

2473
01:39:03.871 --> 01:39:04.670
<v Speaker 3>We bring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2474
01:39:04.670 --> 01:39:06.960
<v Speaker 3>I'd go on a sheet and I don't rely on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the outfit or to the pack for me.</v>

2475
01:39:06.961 --> 01:39:09.450
<v Speaker 3>I bring all my own food and it's all</v>
<v Speaker 3>laid out.</v>

2476
01:39:09.450 --> 01:39:11.520
<v Speaker 3>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all calculate out to the exact</v>

2477
01:39:11.521 --> 01:39:13.950
<v Speaker 3>calorie per day I'm going to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of food do you bring?</v>

2478
01:39:14.190 --> 01:39:16.110
<v Speaker 3>A lot of whole foods now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to bring,</v>

2479
01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:17.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of bars and clif bars and power</v>

2480
01:39:17.761 --> 01:39:19.470
<v Speaker 3>bars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's real food and,</v>

2481
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:20.930
<v Speaker 3>and I both gotten to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2482
01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:24.270
<v Speaker 3>Nuts and whole grains and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

2483
01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:27.030
<v Speaker 3>getting away from the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did meal so much at the have,</v>

2484
01:39:27.090 --> 01:39:27.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high sodium,</v>

2485
01:39:27.871 --> 01:39:30.240
<v Speaker 3>not a lot of nutritional value and</v>
<v Speaker 3>really trying to focus on,</v>

2486
01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:32.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring in breads and peanut butters and</v>

2487
01:39:32.671 --> 01:39:37.080
<v Speaker 3>cheeses and things that will stick with</v>
<v Speaker 3>you versus high sugars and you know,</v>

2488
01:39:37.081 --> 01:39:38.360
<v Speaker 3>quick burns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2489
01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:42.810
<v Speaker 3>When you have dehydrated food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how nutritious is that stuff?</v>

2490
01:39:43.290 --> 01:39:46.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't just scouring the Trisha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think his calories and then if you</v>

2491
01:39:46.111 --> 01:39:48.780
<v Speaker 3>really look at their calories are not</v>
<v Speaker 3>that many calories per ounce.</v>

2492
01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:54.000
<v Speaker 3>They're light and some of them have</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher calories per ounces than others.</v>

2493
01:39:54.001 --> 01:39:56.160
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brendan's come up with a really good</v>

2494
01:39:56.161 --> 01:39:58.740

2495
01:39:58.741 --> 01:40:00.330

<v Speaker 3>you're really creative with it.</v>

2496
01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:01.890
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been kind of building my own,</v>

2497
01:40:01.891 --> 01:40:06.891
<v Speaker 3>like my stuff wasn't my id exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I've modified it a bit and a couple</v>

2498
01:40:07.561 --> 01:40:10.110
<v Speaker 3>of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ramen and peanut butter and fats and</v>

2499
01:40:10.111 --> 01:40:11.270
<v Speaker 3>jerky and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that,</v>

2500
01:40:11.271 --> 01:40:13.900
<v Speaker 3>the heart weighs about the same and has</v>
<v Speaker 3>double the calories and,</v>

2501
01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:15.660
<v Speaker 3>and you don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one thing I,</v>

2502
01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:18.420
<v Speaker 3>this is what I do a lot is advising</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are going on a big hunt,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Don't get a plan.</v>

2505
01:40:22.530 --> 01:40:24.660
<v Speaker 3>Like get a pack on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go for a hike,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2508
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:29.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get all your gear in order.</v>

2509
01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:31.860
<v Speaker 3>And at the end of the day it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a grind.</v>

2510
01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:33.150
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna,</v>

2511
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:35.310
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be full the whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2512
01:40:35.311 --> 01:40:37.710
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to have all the energy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and neat.</v>

2513
01:40:37.711 --> 01:40:39.000
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the beauty of it.</v>

2514
01:40:39.001 --> 01:40:41.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can train all you want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do at the end of the day,</v>

2515
01:40:41.281 --> 01:40:42.630
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be working on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>deficit.</v>

2516
01:40:43.110 --> 01:40:46.310
<v Speaker 3>You need to be sharp and you're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to have to grind through it and</v>

2517
01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:47.640
<v Speaker 3>you have to be tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2518
01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:49.830
<v Speaker 3>That's the beauty of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't be a wimp and do this.</v>

2519
01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:52.590
<v Speaker 3>So how do you figure out how much peanut</v>
<v Speaker 3>butter to bring?</v>

2520
01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:54.233
<v Speaker 3>How does</v>

2521
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:55.510
<v Speaker 2>you can't bring enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2522
01:40:55.511 --> 01:40:56.650
<v Speaker 2>So you gotta burn what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2523
01:40:56.651 --> 01:41:00.550
<v Speaker 2>1,002 thousand calories an hour when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can heavyweight to altitude.</v>

2524
01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Is it really that much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>2000 calories an hour.</v>

2525
01:41:03.911 --> 01:41:05.650
<v Speaker 2>You'll do a thousand calories on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>treadmill an hour.</v>

2526
01:41:06.850 --> 01:41:08.380
<v Speaker 2>But is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that even possible?</v>

2527
01:41:08.381 --> 01:41:13.381
<v Speaker 2>2000 calories an hour if you're hiking</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 12 hours at altitude with weight as</v>

2528
01:41:13.391 --> 01:41:14.360
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>done it.</v>

2529
01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:16.660
<v Speaker 2>It's why you lose a pound a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two pounds a day on these hunts.</v>

2530
01:41:16.661 --> 01:41:18.310
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not in total shape going in,</v>

2531
01:41:18.670 --> 01:41:21.010
<v Speaker 2>which is your body's just burning off</v>
<v Speaker 2>one more than you're taking in,</v>

2532
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:23.200
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be a calorie deficit no</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what.</v>

2533
01:41:23.201 --> 01:41:25.510
<v Speaker 2>And that also puts you at a mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>deficit,</v>

2534
01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:30.730
<v Speaker 2>makes you mentally exhausted when your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body starts using all its resources to</v>

2535
01:41:30.731 --> 01:41:32.740
<v Speaker 2>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same feeling.</v>

2536
01:41:32.741 --> 01:41:36.280
<v Speaker 2>You get cutting weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get on a huge trip when you're</v>

2537
01:41:36.281 --> 01:41:37.900
<v Speaker 2>running out of food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're way back in there.</v>

2538
01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:40.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just like you just got to dig deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you show up for practice</v>

2539
01:41:40.781 --> 01:41:43.540
<v Speaker 2>when you're cutting weight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just got to do it and you just got</v>

2540
01:41:43.541 --> 01:41:46.000
<v Speaker 2>to dig deep and your body will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body responds.</v>

2541
01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:47.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cool thing is your body responding</v>

2542
01:41:47.490 --> 01:41:50.440
<v Speaker 2>will eat what it needs to eat and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just keep going.</v>

2543
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:51.041
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2544
01:41:51.041 --> 01:41:52.580
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2545
01:41:52.581 --> 01:41:54.880
<v Speaker 2>the beauty of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never easy.</v>

2546
01:41:54.970 --> 01:41:55.751
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be,</v>

2547
01:41:55.751 --> 01:41:56.770
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2548
01:41:56.771 --> 01:41:59.610
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting about this is it is</v>

2549
01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:01.870
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pursues test man.</v>

2550
01:42:02.230 --> 01:42:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Now if you're going like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain to me a hunt,</v>

2551
01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:06.330
<v Speaker 2>like say if you're going to go on a like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2552
01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:09.340
<v Speaker 2>a mountain goat haunt or a sheep hunt</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you know you're going to go into</v>

2553
01:42:09.341 --> 01:42:12.220
<v Speaker 2>very difficult terrain and you have x</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of days,</v>

2554
01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:13.930
<v Speaker 2>how do you pack for that?</v>

2555
01:42:14.170 --> 01:42:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Like as far as food?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2556
01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:17.680
<v Speaker 2>two pounds a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two per day.</v>

2557
01:42:18.010 --> 01:42:21.400
<v Speaker 2>And then you want to be range ranging</v>
<v Speaker 2>between 100 to 120 calories per ounce on</v>

2558
01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:24.460
<v Speaker 2>your food choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I break it down.</v>

2559
01:42:24.490 --> 01:42:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you concentrate on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2560
01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:29.860
<v Speaker 2>vitamins?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think about like I do,</v>

2561
01:42:29.890 --> 01:42:30.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring,</v>

2562
01:42:30.490 --> 01:42:32.000
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2563
01:42:32.050 --> 01:42:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2564
01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:34.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2565
01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:37.300
<v Speaker 2>whether it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2566
01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:42.160
<v Speaker 2>electrolyte replacement tax or vitamins</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that type of stuff.</v>

2567
01:42:42.161 --> 01:42:43.870
<v Speaker 2>And then the other part of it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole foods,</v>

2568
01:42:43.871 --> 01:42:46.420
<v Speaker 2>making sure we max out that Kelly's</v>
<v Speaker 2>frowns high fat content.</v>

2569
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:50.380
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing I tell you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell people is try it when you're not</v>

2570
01:42:50.381 --> 01:42:51.760
<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

2571
01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:53.650
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't like it,</v>

2572
01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:58.060
<v Speaker 2>you're going to hate it on the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one year about these new pro bars.</v>

2573
01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.230
<v Speaker 2>If you tried to pro bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2574
01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:01.570
<v Speaker 2>I got those to kind of nasty after</v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile.</v>

2575
01:43:01.810 --> 01:43:03.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nuts and grains.</v>

2576
01:43:03.461 --> 01:43:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very filling and they're very</v>

2577
01:43:04.991 --> 01:43:07.930
<v Speaker 2>big and dense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but triton one for 10 days or three of</v>

2578
01:43:07.931 --> 01:43:10.360
<v Speaker 2>them a day for 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the end of it,</v>

2579
01:43:10.361 --> 01:43:12.850
<v Speaker 2>you don't even want to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've,</v>

2580
01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:16.090
<v Speaker 2>I believe now for me at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I recommend to our customers is</v>

2581
01:43:16.091 --> 01:43:20.290
<v Speaker 2>bring food you like now that you love</v>
<v Speaker 2>and focus on that stuff versus trying to</v>

2582
01:43:20.291 --> 01:43:22.930
<v Speaker 2>get crazy on something new that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't tried and thinking,</v>

2583
01:43:22.931 --> 01:43:24.310
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go to rei and by all these</v>

2584
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:27.250
<v Speaker 2>different types of exotic bars and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll be my food source.</v>

2585
01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:29.140
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I was on a ketogenic diet,</v>

2586
01:43:29.141 --> 01:43:30.790
<v Speaker 2>I was eating like 10 of those pro bars a</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

2587
01:43:30.791 --> 01:43:31.870
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

<v Speaker 4>eat a certain,</v>

2606
01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:14.240
<v Speaker 4>some of them function better for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't like any of the red sauce.</v>

<v Speaker 4>to run on it.</v>

2620
01:44:40.701 --> 01:44:41.451
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what he got to do it,</v>

2621
01:44:41.451 --> 01:44:42.520
<v Speaker 4>do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2622
01:44:42.521 --> 01:44:43.910
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of people,</v>

2623
01:44:43.930 --> 01:44:46.460
<v Speaker 4>you know in freaks him out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what's the thing leaving the</v>

2624
01:44:46.461 --> 01:44:47.900
<v Speaker 4>outfit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was cause you on a sheep hunt,</v>

2625
01:44:47.901 --> 01:44:49.140
<v Speaker 4>they'll provide the food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2626
01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:50.570
<v Speaker 4>But you don't know what they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>give you.</v>

2627
01:44:50.610 --> 01:44:53.340
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what you are going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the always over pack.</v>

2628
01:44:53.341 --> 01:44:54.710
<v Speaker 4>You mean the food bags?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll hand,</v>

2629
01:44:54.711 --> 01:44:58.820
<v Speaker 4>you'll be 40 pounds for 10 days when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>really need 20 pounds because they don't</v>

2630
01:44:58.821 --> 01:45:00.680
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The last thing we want is a client that</v>

2631
01:45:01.190 --> 01:45:05.540
<v Speaker 4>doesn't like what they have to eat or</v>
<v Speaker 4>runs out of food and so this is all part</v>

2632
01:45:05.541 --> 01:45:07.160
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then part of it you may not like</v>

2633
01:45:07.161 --> 01:45:11.570
<v Speaker 4>what they provide you thing is super</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting and I'm messing around with</v>

2634
01:45:11.571 --> 01:45:15.830
<v Speaker 4>that actually as we as we speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the thought of being able to go</v>

2635
01:45:15.831 --> 01:45:19.610
<v Speaker 4>for 10 days with sustained energy while</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're burning your own fat.</v>

2636
01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:21.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is like,</v>

2637
01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:23.840
<v Speaker 4>I would say that's cutting it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm messing around with that right now.</v>

2638
01:45:23.841 --> 01:45:26.060
<v Speaker 4>That's why I got that mct oil and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>that stuff.</v>

2639
01:45:26.061 --> 01:45:27.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try that this fall to see</v>

2640
01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:29.500
<v Speaker 4>because I've been in places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2641
01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:31.310
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's kind of funny like I've had</v>

2642
01:45:31.311 --> 01:45:35.030
<v Speaker 4>times where you run out of food or you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have so little food that I think your</v>

2643
01:45:35.031 --> 01:45:38.090
<v Speaker 4>body has switched over to where it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>just strictly absolutely.</v>

2644
01:45:38.150 --> 01:45:40.490
<v Speaker 4>And then you feel fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like it just goes away.</v>

2645
01:45:40.491 --> 01:45:43.220
<v Speaker 4>So we'll hunger goes away in some sort</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a weird way,</v>

2646
01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:46.070
<v Speaker 4>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also a bunch of different people</v>

2647
01:45:46.071 --> 01:45:49.580
<v Speaker 4>that are involved in this now that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming up with snacks and different</v>

2648
01:45:49.581 --> 01:45:52.090
<v Speaker 4>foods that you could take with you when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a,</v>

2649
01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:54.050
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the reasons why I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 4>to ask you guys what you're carrying</v>

2650
01:45:54.051 --> 01:45:56.630
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but once your body's into Ketosis,</v>

2651
01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:58.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you just need high fat,</v>

2652
01:45:58.551 --> 01:46:00.770
<v Speaker 4>high fat content foods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you've got to figure out how to keep</v>

2653
01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:00.890
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2654
01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:01.670
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2655
01:46:01.670 --> 01:46:04.940
<v Speaker 4>Keep them from going bad while you were</v>
<v Speaker 4>out there in the mountain,</v>

2656
01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:07.550
<v Speaker 4>but almond butter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things along those lines and bringing a</v>

2657
01:46:07.551 --> 01:46:10.070
<v Speaker 4>lot more of that than powerbars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2658
01:46:10.071 --> 01:46:11.600
<v Speaker 4>and peanut butter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the probably peanut butters,</v>

2659
01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:14.630
<v Speaker 4>most peanut butter you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>is going to be loaded up with sugar and</v>

2660
01:46:14.631 --> 01:46:18.960
<v Speaker 4>just you can even get the insulin spikes</v>
<v Speaker 4>are going to get the crashes when,</v>

2661
01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.590
<v Speaker 4>when you talking about 20 pounds of</v>
<v Speaker 4>food,</v>

2662
01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:24.260
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't seem like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you tell me 20 pounds of food for how</v>

2663

<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

2668
01:46:35.001 --> 01:46:36.410
<v Speaker 4>it's not like you're sitting around</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're glassing it.</v>

2672
01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:41.481
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2673
01:46:41.481 --> 01:46:45.180
<v Speaker 4>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the line as you're hungry to go,</v>

2674
01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:46.520
<v Speaker 4>it's like going on a diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2675
01:46:46.521 --> 01:46:47.191
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2676
01:46:47.191 --> 01:46:50.370
<v Speaker 4>it's basically you're in the mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your meal prepped.</v>

2677
01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Like there's your little meal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2678
01:46:52.261 --> 01:46:54.750
<v Speaker 3>it's like these guys that are slimming</v>
<v Speaker 3>down and be on these competent,</v>

2679
01:46:54.751 --> 01:46:56.040
<v Speaker 3>you know what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all you get.</v>

2680
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:58.350
<v Speaker 3>And do you have them broken down into</v>
<v Speaker 3>packets?</v>

2681
01:46:58.351 --> 01:47:00.240
<v Speaker 3>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have broken down per day,</v>

2682
01:47:00.750 --> 01:47:04.620
<v Speaker 3>so I have a Ziploc bag with my day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how big is,</v>

2683
01:47:04.621 --> 01:47:06.270
<v Speaker 3>it was a law clerk and it's about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>

2684
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:08.130
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's not very big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>

2685
01:47:08.131 --> 01:47:09.100
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you know,</v>

2686
01:47:09.150 --> 01:47:10.980
<v Speaker 3>every day is broken down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly that way.</v>

2687
01:47:10.981 --> 01:47:12.720
<v Speaker 3>So what's nice about it as you get back</v>
<v Speaker 3>at night,</v>

2688
01:47:12.721 --> 01:47:15.570
<v Speaker 3>you're exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take your empty bag out that you ate</v>

2689
01:47:15.571 --> 01:47:17.010
<v Speaker 3>all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that goes in the garbage,</v>

2690
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:20.550
<v Speaker 3>and then you pull your new one out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your food bag and dump in your pack.</v>

2691
01:47:20.551 --> 01:47:22.680
<v Speaker 3>So there's no guesswork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None can't be.</v>

2692
01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:25.500
<v Speaker 3>And Are you eating this stuff like we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were talking about before you go out</v>

<v Speaker 3>a lot of calories for like a little tiny</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

2727
01:48:38.341 --> 01:48:41.940
<v Speaker 3>but very nutrient dense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for someone who's trying to burn off</v>

<v Speaker 3>sugars was introduced to me.</v>

2732
01:48:50.161 --> 01:48:52.770
<v Speaker 3>We're doing some vo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two Max testing and weight with our</v>

2733
01:48:52.771 --> 01:48:55.140
<v Speaker 3>packs on at a UC Davis performance lab.</v>

2734
01:48:55.650 --> 01:48:57.060
<v Speaker 3>And that guy trained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2735
01:48:57.090 --> 01:49:01.120
<v Speaker 3>worked with us cycling team and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were talking about this movement into</v>

2736
01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:04.020
<v Speaker 3>burning fat versus using gel shots and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugars.</v>

2737
01:49:04.250 --> 01:49:06.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've started to,</v>

2738
01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:09.120
<v Speaker 3>in our diets and what we bring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been our focus and this made a</v>

2739
01:49:09.210 --> 01:49:11.610
<v Speaker 3>really big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's made a big difference with me.</v>

2740
01:49:11.630 --> 01:49:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's made a big difference with a lot of</v>

2741
01:49:12.901 --> 01:49:15.840
<v Speaker 3>UFC fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Misha tate switched over to a Kesha,</v>

2742
01:49:15.841 --> 01:49:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Jen tita genic die before she won the</v>
<v Speaker 3>title.</v>

2743
01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:19.560
<v Speaker 3>Brian Caraway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her boyfriend,</v>

2744
01:49:19.561 --> 01:49:22.110
<v Speaker 3>he's on it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said weight cutting is way easier as</v>

2745
01:49:22.111 --> 01:49:24.930
<v Speaker 3>performance levels are higher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that I'm finding</v>

2746
01:49:24.931 --> 01:49:28.650
<v Speaker 3>with myself and with a lot of my friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>have gone on as your testosterone goes</v>

2747
01:49:28.651 --> 01:49:30.540
<v Speaker 3>up noticeably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some guys,</v>

2748
01:49:30.570 --> 01:49:33.840
<v Speaker 3>it's going up by double real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because the precursors for</v>

2749
01:49:33.841 --> 01:49:35.460
<v Speaker 3>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all about,</v>

2750
01:49:35.490 --> 01:49:36.510
<v Speaker 3>it's all about fats.</v>

2751
01:49:36.690 --> 01:49:39.000
<v Speaker 3>It's all about your body turns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fats,</v>

2752
01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:43.200
<v Speaker 3>saturated fats and cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff that you were eating from</v>

2753
01:49:43.230 --> 01:49:46.710
<v Speaker 3>healthy fats turns that into hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like what it,</v>

2754
01:49:47.470 --> 01:49:48.380
<v Speaker 3>and it's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2755
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:51.520
<v Speaker 3>the big problems with going on high</v>
<v Speaker 3>carb,</v>

2756
01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:55.960
<v Speaker 3>low fat diets is that your body has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult time creating hormones through</v>

2757
01:49:55.961 --> 01:49:56.794
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>

2758
01:49:56.950 --> 01:50:00.220
<v Speaker 3>Really interesting and new stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out is if these guys that are</v>

2759
01:50:00.221 --> 01:50:02.500
<v Speaker 3>taking it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're finding that when they're doing</v>

2760
01:50:02.501 --> 01:50:05.470
<v Speaker 3>their blood tests that their</v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone levels are higher,</v>

2761
01:50:05.471 --> 01:50:08.380
<v Speaker 3>their growth hormone levels are higher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting stuff.</v>

2762
01:50:08.590 --> 01:50:13.590
<v Speaker 3>Like I think your body is designed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat that natural food like plants and</v>

2763
01:50:14.291 --> 01:50:16.240
<v Speaker 3>vegetables and meats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

2764
01:50:16.241 --> 01:50:17.950
<v Speaker 3>you watch a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What eats first?</v>

2765
01:50:18.670 --> 01:50:20.400
<v Speaker 3>All the fat fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2766
01:50:20.401 --> 01:50:21.640
<v Speaker 3>He needs to meet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2767
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:24.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the number one food</v>
<v Speaker 3>source,</v>

2768
01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:26.770
<v Speaker 3>energy sources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fat first.</v>

2769
01:50:26.890 --> 01:50:29.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a wonderful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just for,</v>

2770
01:50:29.290 --> 01:50:31.090
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our society society,</v>

2771
01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:33.010
<v Speaker 3>that's what makes people fat is really</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sugars.</v>

2772
01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:34.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a sugar.</v>

2773
01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:37.660
<v Speaker 3>It's 100% of the sugars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This stuff changes all the time.</v>

2774
01:50:37.661 --> 01:50:41.560
<v Speaker 3>And if you go back five years ago and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you read some of the studies that are</v>

2775
01:50:41.561 --> 01:50:46.090
<v Speaker 3>done and what people recommend like for</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as diet now today it's totally</v>

2776
01:50:46.091 --> 01:50:47.380
<v Speaker 3>contrary to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

2777
01:50:47.381 --> 01:50:48.540
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting how this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2778
01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:51.910
<v Speaker 3>the edge is always moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a cutting edge of this stuff is</v>

2779
01:50:51.911 --> 01:50:53.080
<v Speaker 3>always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always changing.</v>

2780
01:50:53.081 --> 01:50:57.400
<v Speaker 3>And people were always coming up with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>new studies that show better ways to</v>

2781
01:50:57.401 --> 01:50:59.320
<v Speaker 3>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the fun thing about what</v>

2782
01:50:59.321 --> 01:51:00.730
<v Speaker 3>we're doing is we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2783
01:51:00.731 --> 01:51:02.920
<v Speaker 3>we're always there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no magic bullet.</v>

2784
01:51:02.921 --> 01:51:04.840
<v Speaker 3>I got guys call all the time like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Clear small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the name?</v>

2788
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:14.970
<v Speaker 3>What does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Island in southeast Alaska ties density</v>

2789
01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:19.000
<v Speaker 3>of black bears in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've handed it and it wasn't dot</v>

2790
01:51:19.001 --> 01:51:23.290
<v Speaker 3>comed and I just liked the way the name</v>
<v Speaker 3>lays out.</v>

2791
01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:25.750
<v Speaker 3>I like the way the balance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the look and when I was hunting it,</v>

2792
01:51:26.050 --> 01:51:29.530
<v Speaker 3>and this is when I had Sitka is hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>there with my ex business partner and</v>

2793
01:51:29.531 --> 01:51:34.531
<v Speaker 3>actually gortex before they had licensed</v>
<v Speaker 3>us and invested in us and woke up the</v>

2794
01:51:34.611 --> 01:51:37.250
<v Speaker 3>morning before everybody else is sitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the back of the button and I like</v>

2795
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:38.800
<v Speaker 3>thinking about Kuya the name and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2796
01:51:38.801 --> 01:51:40.000
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the name of the next</v>
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>

2797
01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:45.540
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know why that even came to</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mind because we're in the midst of</v>

2798
01:51:45.551 --> 01:51:48.280
<v Speaker 3>buildings that could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just liked the name for whatever</v>

2799
01:51:48.281 --> 01:51:50.050
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just my gut told me that was it.</v>

2800
01:51:50.290 --> 01:51:51.850
<v Speaker 3>Go with the gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

2801
01:51:51.970 --> 01:51:53.320
<v Speaker 3>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time.</v>

2802
01:51:53.410 --> 01:51:54.600
<v Speaker 3>Every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2803
01:51:54.650 --> 01:51:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Isn't amazing when you follow it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how powerful it is.</v>

2804
01:51:57.250 --> 01:51:59.530
<v Speaker 3>It's my whole life I've always gone with</v>
<v Speaker 3>my gut.</v>

2805
01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:00.671
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2806
01:52:00.671 --> 01:52:01.450
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

2807
01:52:01.450 --> 01:52:02.860
<v Speaker 3>there's no other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2808
01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:05.200
<v Speaker 3>so many people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are driven or,</v>

2809
01:52:05.201 --> 01:52:08.320
<v Speaker 3>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her entire life is about fear and it</v>

2810
01:52:08.321 --> 01:52:12.130
<v Speaker 3>dictates everything they do versus</v>
<v Speaker 3>following your gut and putting the fear</v>

2811
01:52:12.131 --> 01:52:14.800
<v Speaker 3>of side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once you do it makes all the</v>

2812
01:52:14.801 --> 01:52:16.750
<v Speaker 3>difference in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If fear is good,</v>

2813
01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:19.210
<v Speaker 3>it is a motivating factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2814
01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:23.020
<v Speaker 3>Well it's also the lack of fear can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>very dangerous.</v>

2815
01:52:23.170 --> 01:52:23.940
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>

2816
01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:26.710
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I would say like</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are not scared when they're</v>

2817
01:52:26.711 --> 01:52:29.020
<v Speaker 3>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like those two people are in trouble.</v>

2818
01:52:29.050 --> 01:52:29.741
<v Speaker 3>You're in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2819
01:52:29.741 --> 01:52:31.480
<v Speaker 3>You should be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It nobody likes to be scared.</v>

2820
01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:34.000
<v Speaker 3>But when I was competing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst tournament's that I ever</v>

2821
01:52:34.001 --> 01:52:35.800
<v Speaker 3>fought in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was not nervous.</v>

2822
01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:39.460
<v Speaker 3>It was too confident and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just perform poorly.</v>

2823
01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:42.910
<v Speaker 3>But when I was fucking terrified and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like completely on edge,</v>

2824
01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:45.770
<v Speaker 3>then your body's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just primal.</v>

2825
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:46.130
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

2826
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:50.930
<v Speaker 1>just like you get down to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the bare minimum amount of</v>

2827
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:54.610
<v Speaker 1>understanding of what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have to do of the thinking,</v>

2828
01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:56.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world fades away.</v>

2829
01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:58.670
<v Speaker 1>And all you're thinking about is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>task.</v>

2830
01:52:58.790 --> 01:53:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you cutting out everything else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no thought about bills.</v>

2831
01:53:02.541 --> 01:53:06.110
<v Speaker 1>There's no thought about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just what's going on in front of</v>

2832
01:53:06.111 --> 01:53:07.040
<v Speaker 1>you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

2833
01:53:07.110 --> 01:53:10.520
<v Speaker 1>if you can get down to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you perform at your best.</v>

2834
01:53:10.521 --> 01:53:12.500
<v Speaker 1>But it's fucking terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So nobody likes it.</v>

2835
01:53:12.710 --> 01:53:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Nobody likes to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see guys that are in like the</v>

2836
01:53:16.071 --> 01:53:18.140
<v Speaker 1>UFC that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2837
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:20.630
<v Speaker 1>here's a good example now I'm a big fan</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Luke rockhold.</v>

2838
01:53:20.631 --> 01:53:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I think he's an awesome guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just talking about on the way down,</v>

2839
01:53:22.391 --> 01:53:25.520
<v Speaker 1>he was way too relaxed the time he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to kill Michael Bisping.</v>

2840
01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Michael bisping fought that fight like</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was going in against a fucking silver</v>

2841
01:53:29.771 --> 01:53:30.604
<v Speaker 1>back gorilla.</v>

2842
01:53:30.770 --> 01:53:33.080
<v Speaker 1>He was terrified or not terrified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2843
01:53:33.081 --> 01:53:37.370
<v Speaker 1>jacked up with nerves and like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>always on the line for him and that's</v>

2844
01:53:37.371 --> 01:53:38.390
<v Speaker 1>how you walked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knocked him out.</v>

2845
01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Such a great sport because first knock</v>
<v Speaker 1>out too in the UFC,</v>

2846
01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:44.790
<v Speaker 1>it's this first Kale like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I sell them on the way to</v>

2847
01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:49.540
<v Speaker 1>like Jorge Rivera in Manchester and kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of get beat down mayhem.</v>

2848
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Miller as a Tko.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

2849
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:53.690
<v Speaker 1>the Tkos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2850
01:53:53.691 --> 01:53:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's also sitting down and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>punches better.</v>

2851
01:53:56.001 --> 01:53:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Jason Parillo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his boxing coach has really been working</v>

2852
01:53:59.061 --> 01:54:03.080
<v Speaker 1>with him and d done a fantastic job with</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and with Cris Cyborg and a bunch of</v>

2853
01:54:03.081 --> 01:54:07.790
<v Speaker 1>other people that you build up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That reminded me of Keith Jardine</v>

2854
01:54:07.791 --> 01:54:10.120
<v Speaker 1>talking about Houston Alexander.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2855
01:54:10.190 --> 01:54:11.300
<v Speaker 1>I kept thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2856
01:54:11.301 --> 01:54:14.600
<v Speaker 1>he's really dismissive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even in my league and all that</v>

2857
01:54:14.601 --> 01:54:16.910
<v Speaker 1>stuff and all of a sudden you're done.</v>

2858
01:54:17.210 --> 01:54:20.300
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a guy's a professional fighter,</v>

2859
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:22.640
<v Speaker 1>if you just stood there and let him</v>
<v Speaker 1>punch you in the face,</v>

2860
01:54:22.641 --> 01:54:23.630
<v Speaker 1>would it knock you out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2861
01:54:23.631 --> 01:54:24.381
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2862
01:54:24.381 --> 01:54:26.580
<v Speaker 1>so that it can fucking happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kind of,</v>

2863
01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:29.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the last thing you want to be is the</v>

2864
01:54:29.061 --> 01:54:30.620
<v Speaker 1>guy that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy can't beat me.</v>

2865
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:31.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go in there and fuck them</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2866
01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:33.920
<v Speaker 1>And then you wake up with a flashlight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your eyes like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>One of the cool things about UFC fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>passes,</v>

2922
01:56:13.290 --> 01:56:14.580
<v Speaker 1>you can listen into the corners.</v>

2923
01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can?</v>

2924
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The corner guys are miked up,</v>

2925
01:56:16.741 --> 01:56:18.930
<v Speaker 1>so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hear like someone saying,</v>

2926
01:56:18.990 --> 01:56:19.741
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2927
01:56:19.741 --> 01:56:21.210

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2929
01:56:21.930 --> 01:56:23.860

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2930
01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:25.440

<v Speaker 1>You just get,</v>

2931
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:29.880
<v Speaker 1>you get insight and you also get a sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a building up anticipation.</v>

2932
01:56:29.881 --> 01:56:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Like if you know that a guy's got an</v>
<v Speaker 1>injury and then he's trying to gut it</v>

2933
01:56:32.941 --> 01:56:34.650
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it even more exciting to watch.</v>

2934
01:56:34.670 --> 01:56:35.420
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2935
01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:36.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an awesome sport.</v>

2936
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only have a couple of hobbies watching</v>

2937
01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:41.250
<v Speaker 1>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>

2938
01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:42.141
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're,</v>

2939
01:56:42.141 --> 01:56:42.961
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

2940
01:56:42.961 --> 01:56:44.190
<v Speaker 1>they're very comparable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2941
01:56:44.450 --> 01:56:46.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from going from being a wrestler.</v>

2942
01:56:46.051 --> 01:56:46.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2943
01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:47.433
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2944
01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:50.040
<v Speaker 1>it's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's slow portions of nothing in this</v>

2945
01:56:50.041 --> 01:56:51.840
<v Speaker 1>training and grinding and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden,</v>

2946
01:56:51.841 --> 01:56:54.390
<v Speaker 1>and then every now and again you get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>step in and,</v>

2947
01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:55.290
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2948
01:56:55.290 --> 01:56:56.190
<v Speaker 1>and see where you're at.</v>

2949
01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:56.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2950
01:56:56.631 --> 01:56:57.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2951
01:56:57.390 --> 01:56:59.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you always say like two guys.</v>

2952
01:56:59.071 --> 01:56:59.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2953
01:56:59.550 --> 01:57:02.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a stripped down to the gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You either win or lose at 50 50.</v>

2954
01:57:02.131 --> 01:57:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm either going to win or I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And same with hunting.</v>

2955
01:57:04.561 --> 01:57:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean at at certain point in time in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hunt,</v>

2956
01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:10.800
<v Speaker 1>you either you either get them or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like the percentages work out like</v>

2957
01:57:10.801 --> 01:57:11.670
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2958
01:57:11.671 --> 01:57:13.080
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the cool thing about it.</v>

2959
01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Well I think also like hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

2960
01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:18.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not perceived correctly by a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2961
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:22.050
<v Speaker 1>It was very misunderstood and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think of it as this barbaric,</v>

2962
01:57:22.051 --> 01:57:26.460
<v Speaker 1>awful thing involving bullies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes when really they're incredibly</v>

2963
01:57:26.461 --> 01:57:29.220
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult people were pursuing one of</v>

2964
01:57:29.221 --> 01:57:32.130
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most difficult things to do</v>

2965
01:57:32.131 --> 01:57:35.970
<v Speaker 1>with dire physical consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you fail those bullies and assholes,</v>

2966
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.440
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the dedication to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2967
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Those aren't the real guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they don't have the understanding</v>

2968
01:57:40.111 --> 01:57:43.470
<v Speaker 1>of who they actually are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two do in order to face your own</v>

2969
01:57:43.471 --> 01:57:44.880
<v Speaker 1>fears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of the bullies in the</v>

2970
01:57:44.881 --> 01:57:48.630
<v Speaker 1>assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can get a certain distance with</v>

2971
01:57:48.631 --> 01:57:50.970
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with physical power and genetic</v>

2972
01:57:50.971 --> 01:57:53.370
<v Speaker 1>attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some guys just hit fucking hard</v>

2973
01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:57.240
<v Speaker 1>and they're just good at taking a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you stand in front of them,</v>

2974
01:57:57.241 --> 01:57:59.430
<v Speaker 1>whale with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might catch you and knock you out</v>

2975
01:57:59.431 --> 01:58:01.500
<v Speaker 1>and beat your ass and you just got beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a bully.</v>

2976
01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:06.660
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is when those guys get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a steep emile chick or Cain Velasquez</v>

2977
01:58:06.661 --> 01:58:09.030
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best of the best,</v>

2978
01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:10.470
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2979
01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Because those guys are just as just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically strong just as kate,</v>

2980
01:58:14.221 --> 01:58:16.590
<v Speaker 1>but also have their mental shit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

2981
01:58:16.690 --> 01:58:19.380
<v Speaker 1>They have their ego in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their understanding in order.</v>

2982
01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:24.040
<v Speaker 1>And those guys are some of the nicest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most down to earth people you ever going</v>

2983
01:58:24.041 --> 01:58:26.610
<v Speaker 1>to meet because they get their ego</v>
<v Speaker 1>checked on a daily basis.</v>

2984
01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Every one of my met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have some guys that are customers of</v>

2985
01:58:29.221 --> 01:58:29.940
<v Speaker 1>ours.</v>

<v Speaker 1>sharp guys.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Very thoughtful.</v>

2989
01:58:40.231 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean just great people to be around.</v>

2990
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:44.710
<v Speaker 3>And they also recognize that same thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>in hunting.</v>

2991
01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:45.191
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>libs for it.</v>

2993
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:53.800
<v Speaker 3>He wants to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like now on most really good athletes</v>

2994
01:58:53.801 --> 01:58:55.840
<v Speaker 3>that you would come across that are hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like that's,</v>

2995
01:58:55.870 --> 01:58:59.560
<v Speaker 3>that's like their second passion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love doing tons of baseball players</v>

2996
01:58:59.561 --> 01:59:02.140
<v Speaker 3>and football players and I mean cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>like man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3000
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same guys were the hunters of the tribe,</v>

3001
01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:10.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are the athletes.</v>

3002
01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:11.621
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just,</v>

3003
01:59:11.621 --> 01:59:13.870
<v Speaker 3>it's a natural natural deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a,</v>

3004
01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:16.210
<v Speaker 3>Carson Palmer is a customer of ours and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had never,</v>

3005
01:59:16.211 --> 01:59:17.980
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda like you never been hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

3006
01:59:18.490 --> 01:59:21.280
<v Speaker 3>Carson Palmer is a quarterback for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cards.</v>

3007
01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:23.050
<v Speaker 3>I literally don't follow any other</v>
<v Speaker 3>sports.</v>

3008
01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:25.150
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you everything you want to</v>

3009
01:59:25.151 --> 01:59:30.040
<v Speaker 3>know about mma or kickboxing or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love a narrow focus now I'm all about</v>

3010
01:59:30.041 --> 01:59:31.060
<v Speaker 3>narrow folk apparently.</v>

3011
01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:33.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Carson won a thing called the heisman</v>

3012
01:59:33.191 --> 01:59:34.720
<v Speaker 3>trophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard about that.</v>

3013
01:59:34.721 --> 01:59:37.240
<v Speaker 3>Jamie told me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this metal trophy thing that you</v>

3014
01:59:37.241 --> 01:59:40.300
<v Speaker 3>get for playing football in college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he's the quarterback for the</v>

3015
01:59:40.450 --> 01:59:43.000
<v Speaker 3>now of the cardinals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then he was Cincinnati and he had a</v>

3016
01:59:43.001 --> 01:59:46.120
<v Speaker 3>guy on the team that took them hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>during a off during one of their by</v>

3017
01:59:46.121 --> 01:59:47.830
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it up in a tree stand.</v>

3018
01:59:47.890 --> 01:59:49.840
<v Speaker 3>He never been hunting before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He grew up in Orange County like I did</v>

3019
01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:52.870
<v Speaker 3>and he said the first time the deer</v>
<v Speaker 3>walked under a stand,</v>

3020
01:59:52.871 --> 01:59:54.100
<v Speaker 3>a buck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3021
01:59:54.101 --> 01:59:59.101
<v Speaker 3>the adrenaline and the DNA of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>process took over and he is just a die</v>

3022
01:59:59.631 --> 02:00:01.990
<v Speaker 3>hard hunter now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's all he wants to do.</v>

3023
02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:03.730
<v Speaker 3>When he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he's done playing football,</v>

3024
02:00:03.731 --> 02:00:05.050
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he only wants a honey,</v>

3025
02:00:05.051 --> 02:00:07.120
<v Speaker 3>he wants to invest in Ku use so it can</v>
<v Speaker 3>be involved with hunting.</v>

3026
02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:09.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just that happened for him like it</v>

3027
02:00:09.461 --> 02:00:12.400
<v Speaker 3>happened for you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it happens so much with athletes.</v>

3028
02:00:12.401 --> 02:00:17.370
<v Speaker 3>We have Brent Burns plays for the game</v>
<v Speaker 3>called hockey hockey that's on the thing</v>

3029
02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:19.660
<v Speaker 3>on ice with ice skates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He actually,</v>

3030
02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:20.930
<v Speaker 3>well it is water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they freeze it,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3033
02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.580
<v Speaker 3>and he's the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just got into hunting and he is just</v>

3034
02:00:24.581 --> 02:00:26.530
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the most amazing thing.</v>

3035
02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:27.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just DNA.</v>

3036
02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:29.060
<v Speaker 3>It's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3037
02:00:29.070 --> 02:00:31.390

3038
02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:33.250
<v Speaker 3>incredibly rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3039
02:00:33.251 --> 02:00:34.990
<v Speaker 3>like when I go to the store and buy a</v>
<v Speaker 3>steak,</v>

3040
02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:36.130
<v Speaker 3>there's no reward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3041
02:00:36.131 --> 02:00:36.911
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3059
02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:13.900
<v Speaker 3>It's the best meat you can ever eat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>my kids have been eating it for four</v>

3060
02:01:13.901 --> 02:01:15.240
<v Speaker 3>years now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a six year old.</v>

3061
02:01:15.241 --> 02:01:16.990
<v Speaker 3>It's been eaten bear since she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

3062
02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:17.801
<v Speaker 3>So awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3063
02:01:17.801 --> 02:01:19.600
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the healthiest food.</v>

3064
02:01:19.650 --> 02:01:21.460
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels better.</v>

3065
02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:23.710
<v Speaker 3>It feels better when you eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really does.</v>

3066
02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:25.450
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's flat out better for you too.</v>

3067
02:01:25.810 --> 02:01:26.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3068
02:01:26.381 --> 02:01:31.330
<v Speaker 3>and I'm really into pursuing the art of</v>
<v Speaker 3>cooking it in a bunch of different ways</v>

3069
02:01:31.331 --> 02:01:31.600
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

3070
02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:33.970
<v Speaker 3>And that's another thing that I learned</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Rinella.</v>

3071
02:01:33.971 --> 02:01:36.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting Hank Shaw who I think lives up</v>

3072
02:01:36.311 --> 02:01:40.970
<v Speaker 3>your way too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's a wild game famous chef who's</v>

3073
02:01:41.150 --> 02:01:46.150
<v Speaker 3>turned to becoming a hunter because he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was interested in trying to prepare this</v>

3074
02:01:46.641 --> 02:01:50.090
<v Speaker 3>food and be more connected with food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then he started hunting and then</v>

3077
02:01:55.701 --> 02:01:58.210
<v Speaker 3>where the animal actually lives.</v>

3104
02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:55.190
<v Speaker 3>he took me hunting in Montana recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went on a pheasant hunt and uh,</v>

3105
02:02:55.191 --> 02:02:56.024
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3106
02:02:56.210 --> 02:03:00.110
<v Speaker 3>he's a big fan of doing that as well as</v>
<v Speaker 3>cooking the animals.</v>

3107
02:03:00.111 --> 02:03:01.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>prepare it properly and he's done that a</v>

3109
02:03:05.331 --> 02:03:08.030
<v Speaker 3>bunch of times on his show and involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>

3110
02:03:08.031 --> 02:03:09.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3111
02:03:09.411 --> 02:03:11.270
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually fun to put different</v>

3112
02:03:11.271 --> 02:03:12.950
<v Speaker 3>Marinades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put different recipes together.</v>

3113
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:13.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I throw it on the barbecue,</v>

3114
02:03:13.911 --> 02:03:16.360
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot that goes into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also you know,</v>

3115
02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:18.620
<v Speaker 3>something that people don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think enough of with wild game,</v>

3116
02:03:18.621 --> 02:03:20.720
<v Speaker 3>they wonder why it doesn't taste right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's proper aging.</v>

3117
02:03:20.721 --> 02:03:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Your meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you'd do that with</v>

3118
02:03:22.401 --> 02:03:24.560
<v Speaker 3>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do sometimes,</v>

3119
02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:26.870
<v Speaker 3>but most of the time I just cook it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3120
02:03:26.871 --> 02:03:30.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's better if you're agent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do a quick age of your fridge.</v>

3121
02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:34.010
<v Speaker 3>We put up like on a rack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a in like a pan or a plate with</v>

3122
02:03:34.011 --> 02:03:37.100
<v Speaker 3>like a wire rack that gets it off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom of it and then put foil over the</v>

3123
02:03:37.101 --> 02:03:40.190
<v Speaker 3>top and let that blood drain out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how long do you age it for?</v>

3124
02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:42.560
<v Speaker 3>I'll age backstrap for 10 days in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>fridge.</v>

3125
02:03:42.650 --> 02:03:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it is so much better.</v>

3126
02:03:44.930 --> 02:03:46.190
<v Speaker 3>What does it smell like?</v>

3127
02:03:46.190 --> 02:03:48.680
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't smell like anything really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

3128
02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:51.530
<v Speaker 3>How come it doesn't stink after 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And your friends not rotting,</v>

3129
02:03:51.890 --> 02:03:53.600
<v Speaker 3>it's just aging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do that with beef.</v>

3130
02:03:53.630 --> 02:03:55.980
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then the outside of it is all black.</v>

3131
02:03:56.380 --> 02:03:57.720
<v Speaker 3>But that's what you're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

3132
02:03:57.721 --> 02:04:00.200
<v Speaker 3>you're cut off the outside edges and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you do.</v>

3133
02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:02.360
<v Speaker 3>It'll trap as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you'd do with any me.</v>

3134
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that outside doesn't stink.</v>

3135
02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:07.070
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just gets dry and it actually builds</v>

3136
02:04:07.071 --> 02:04:08.990
<v Speaker 3>a crust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Trim off the crust and cook the</v>

3137
02:04:08.991 --> 02:04:12.020
<v Speaker 3>middle million times better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the temperature that it has to</v>

3138
02:04:12.021 --> 02:04:14.950
<v Speaker 3>be at when you're doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can cook it medium to cook a medium</v>

3139
02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:17.110
<v Speaker 3>rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you're the giants,</v>

3140
02:04:17.370 --> 02:04:18.950
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to quick age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes on your fridge.</v>

3141
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Just the normal frigerator temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what,</v>

3142
02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>36 38 degrees.</v>

3143
02:04:23.390 --> 02:04:26.510
<v Speaker 3>But when they like dry age meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you go to a like one of those</v>

3144
02:04:26.940 --> 02:04:28.840
<v Speaker 3>shops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>similar temperatures,</v>

3145
02:04:28.850 --> 02:04:31.610
<v Speaker 3>my brother went to culinary school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the one that taught me that real.</v>

3146
02:04:31.650 --> 02:04:34.460
<v Speaker 3>It was like you need to age your meat</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause you'll get all the blood out of</v>

3147
02:04:34.461 --> 02:04:36.530
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The blood is what causes a Gamey or</v>

3148
02:04:36.531 --> 02:04:41.100
<v Speaker 3>flavor and also it also tend to rise as</v>
<v Speaker 3>your meat when you agent try it right?</v>

3149
02:04:41.101 --> 02:04:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Because you take a piece of back strap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it in the fridge with little bit of</v>

3150
02:04:44.551 --> 02:04:46.650
<v Speaker 3>soy sauce and some brown sugar or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something on it.</v>

3151
02:04:46.651 --> 02:04:47.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not eating sugar anymore,</v>

3152
02:04:47.850 --> 02:04:49.110
<v Speaker 3>but if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll,</v>

3153
02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:53.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it would go bad.</v>

3154
02:04:53.581 --> 02:04:55.110
<v Speaker 3>It's never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never left it long enough where you</v>

3155
02:04:55.111 --> 02:04:56.370
<v Speaker 3>couldn't eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3156
02:04:56.371 --> 02:04:57.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've,</v>

3157
02:04:57.690 --> 02:05:00.050
<v Speaker 3>I've left a backstop for weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>

3158
02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:00.800
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>

3159
02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:02.870
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't rot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting,</v>

3160
02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:06.240
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does more sustainable because it doesn't</v>

3161
02:05:06.241 --> 02:05:08.130
<v Speaker 3>have all that fat on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a beef steak,</v>

3162
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:09.630
<v Speaker 3>the age beef.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3163
02:05:10.170 --> 02:05:12.390
<v Speaker 3>But do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just seems weird because people</v>

3164
02:05:12.391 --> 02:05:13.360
<v Speaker 3>don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>

3165
02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:18.120
<v Speaker 3>like a guy I know that big African Ph,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll take a whole hind quarter.</v>

3166
02:05:18.570 --> 02:05:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy's name is Steve Colbert and he</v>

3167
02:05:20.281 --> 02:05:21.690
<v Speaker 3>told me this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll take a whole hindquarter and put</v>

3168
02:05:21.691 --> 02:05:24.570
<v Speaker 3>his fridge in a fridge at his house for</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 days.</v>

3169
02:05:24.630 --> 02:05:26.250
<v Speaker 3>And then it's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

3170
02:05:26.580 --> 02:05:29.310
<v Speaker 3>So a Ph for people don't know as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>professional hunter,</v>

3171
02:05:29.311 --> 02:05:32.690
<v Speaker 3>which in Africa is like a guide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

3172
02:05:32.730 --> 02:05:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3173
02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:34.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know Steve Cabrini?</v>

3174
02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:37.440
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's a bow hunter.</v>

3175
02:05:37.650 --> 02:05:39.150
<v Speaker 3>Really cool guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Guy.</v>

3176
02:05:39.170 --> 02:05:40.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's basically killed everything in</v>

3177
02:05:40.981 --> 02:05:43.230
<v Speaker 3>Africa with a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that anybody else has ever</v>

3178
02:05:43.231 --> 02:05:43.500
<v Speaker 3>done it.</v>

3179
02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:46.830
<v Speaker 3>Like this guy's the real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes into the gnarliest places,</v>

3180
02:05:46.831 --> 02:05:50.010
<v Speaker 3>but he takes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes people hunting over there and</v>

3181
02:05:50.011 --> 02:05:50.880
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but almost,</v>

3182
02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:53.970
<v Speaker 3>almost entirely a bow hunter himself</v>
<v Speaker 3>like stud and</v>

3183
02:05:55.490 --> 02:05:56.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

3184
02:05:56.150 --> 02:05:57.810
<v Speaker 3>I'll introduce you to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really cool.</v>

3185
02:05:57.811 --> 02:06:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Like everything and out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's killed more animals in Africa</v>

3186
02:06:00.111 --> 02:06:00.811
<v Speaker 3>than him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

3187
02:06:00.811 --> 02:06:03.560
<v Speaker 3>He's been everywhere to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

3188
02:06:03.561 --> 02:06:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Just think of the sink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking of his meat,</v>

3189
02:06:05.460 --> 02:06:08.580
<v Speaker 3>sit in the frigerator for 30 days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't go bad.</v>

3190
02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:09.990
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3191
02:06:09.991 --> 02:06:13.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a cover it in foil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a rack so the blood can drain out</v>

3192
02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:16.340
<v Speaker 3>and they can sit there for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be a man.</v>

3193
02:06:16.380 --> 02:06:19.290
<v Speaker 3>You'll be amazed at how long you can age</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and how good it is when you do.</v>

3194
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:22.020
<v Speaker 3>Is that the key?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I've had me sit in like a,</v>

3195
02:06:22.050 --> 02:06:24.990
<v Speaker 3>like a bought a steak at a store and let</v>
<v Speaker 3>sit in my refrigerator for too long.</v>

3196
02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:26.610
<v Speaker 3>Then you open up the meeting like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3197
02:06:26.611 --> 02:06:29.480
<v Speaker 3>it smells terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's already been age two and sitting</v>

3198
02:06:29.490 --> 02:06:30.321
<v Speaker 3>on itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3199
02:06:30.321 --> 02:06:32.610
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is that the key that it has to</v>

3200
02:06:32.611 --> 02:06:35.700
<v Speaker 3>drain out of its blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you don't wrap it up.</v>

3201
02:06:35.701 --> 02:06:36.840
<v Speaker 3>Don't put it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

3202
02:06:36.841 --> 02:06:40.670
<v Speaker 3>don't contain it right underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you can,</v>

3203
02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:41.670
<v Speaker 3>the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have a rack,</v>

3204
02:06:41.671 --> 02:06:43.260
<v Speaker 3>you can take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do as a bowl,</v>

3205
02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:44.213
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or a pan.</v>

3206
02:06:44.220 --> 02:06:47.970
<v Speaker 3>I'll put foil over it and punch holes in</v>
<v Speaker 3>it so it's suspended in that blood and</v>

3207
02:06:47.971 --> 02:06:50.090
<v Speaker 3>go through those holes in the flow that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put foil over the top,</v>

3208
02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:53.610
<v Speaker 3>slide it in your fridge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they sell like a rack for aging in</v>

3209
02:06:53.611 --> 02:06:55.230
<v Speaker 3>your refrigerator?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nurses by little,</v>

3210
02:06:55.290 --> 02:06:58.950
<v Speaker 3>they make little cooking racks that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like screens with that are designed</v>

3211
02:06:58.951 --> 02:07:01.260
<v Speaker 3>to go on a pan and get stuff off the off</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a pan.</v>

3212
02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:01.951
<v Speaker 3>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

3213
02:07:01.951 --> 02:07:02.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try that.</v>

3214
02:07:02.911 --> 02:07:03.744
<v Speaker 3>You've got to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3215
02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:06.000
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't make a huge difference.</v>

3216
02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:08.040
<v Speaker 3>I marinate sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I like to do?</v>

3217
02:07:08.041 --> 02:07:11.190
<v Speaker 3>I have to take Newman's own Balsama</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3218
02:07:11.191 --> 02:07:13.140
<v Speaker 3>just put it in that for a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3219
02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:15.200
<v Speaker 3>five or six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a great man.</v>

3220
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:16.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3221
02:07:16.211 --> 02:07:17.760
<v Speaker 3>That's excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then pull it out.</v>

3222
02:07:17.761 --> 02:07:18.594
<v Speaker 3>Someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3223
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:21.240
<v Speaker 3>served a sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at a,</v>

3224
02:07:21.241 --> 02:07:22.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3225
02:07:22.050 --> 02:07:23.880
<v Speaker 3>a camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was absolutely at to hone.</v>

3226
02:07:23.881 --> 02:07:26.750
<v Speaker 3>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a pig hunting and someone,</v>

3227
02:07:26.751 --> 02:07:27.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brought by,</v>

3228
02:07:27.931 --> 02:07:30.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sheep back straps and they had it</v>

3229
02:07:30.931 --> 02:07:33.480
<v Speaker 3>marinated in a Italian address.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God's right there.</v>

3230
02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:37.750
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing better than dall sheep</v>
<v Speaker 3>or stone sheep back shops.</v>

3231
02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:40.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how good they taste so</v>

3232
02:07:40.301 --> 02:07:43.540
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Civitas is that the best meat of all the</v>

3233
02:07:43.541 --> 02:07:47.160
<v Speaker 3>meats is the same as then horn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big horns,</v>

3234
02:07:47.170 --> 02:07:47.700
<v Speaker 3>not near it.</v>

3235
02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:48.730
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>

3236
02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:51.370
<v Speaker 3>And like the harder you work for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better it is.</v>

3237
02:07:51.371 --> 02:07:56.371
<v Speaker 3>But like a sheep tinder line pulled</v>
<v Speaker 3>right out one minute each side as hot as</v>

3238
02:07:56.861 --> 02:07:58.030
<v Speaker 3>you can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

3239
02:07:58.120 --> 02:07:59.290
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

3240
02:07:59.310 --> 02:07:59.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3241
02:07:59.741 --> 02:08:02.230
<v Speaker 3>You just want to see her at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one will ever know how good it is</v>

3242
02:08:02.231 --> 02:08:04.960
<v Speaker 3>because they never make it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No critical ever get a bite of that.</v>

3243
02:08:05.410 --> 02:08:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they never get it out of the</v>

3244
02:08:06.821 --> 02:08:07.654
<v Speaker 3>mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

3245
02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:09.850
<v Speaker 3>Never comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time you cook it while</v>

3246
02:08:09.851 --> 02:08:10.684
<v Speaker 3>you're up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3247
02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:11.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times.</v>

3248
02:08:11.590 --> 02:08:12.423
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

3249
02:08:12.630 --> 02:08:17.470
<v Speaker 3>We have a thing called man Kebabs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is you got to hunt down the</v>

3250
02:08:17.471 --> 02:08:18.940
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to kill it.</v>

3251
02:08:19.210 --> 02:08:21.130
<v Speaker 3>You got to bring it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to pack it back to camp.</v>

3252
02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:23.350
<v Speaker 3>You got to start a fire that you create.</v>

3253
02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:26.380
<v Speaker 3>You got to harvest the willow stick that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna put the meat on and you</v>

3254
02:08:26.381 --> 02:08:28.840
<v Speaker 3>chop it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You slide on the meat and at the time we</v>

3255
02:08:28.841 --> 02:08:32.290
<v Speaker 3>only had top ramen seasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we sprinkle the top Rosin Rom</v>

3256
02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:33.730
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it over the fire.</v>

3257
02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:38.110
<v Speaker 3>That's a man Kebab top vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of kind of funny though.</v>

3258
02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:40.470
<v Speaker 3>The top Ramen is the CS,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but top Ramen sees you.</v>

3259
02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:41.920
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking,</v>

3260
02:08:41.950 --> 02:08:44.010
<v Speaker 3>when I used to eat that stuff and I get</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it,</v>

3261
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:47.080
<v Speaker 3>I'll just a little bit on the table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it on my finger.</v>

3262
02:08:47.110 --> 02:08:48.580
<v Speaker 3>It's delicious too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good season,</v>

3263
02:08:48.581 --> 02:08:50.530
<v Speaker 3>good seasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get really creative.</v>

3264
02:08:50.531 --> 02:08:52.930
<v Speaker 3>You don't have much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably a good idea to like to</v>

3265
02:08:52.931 --> 02:08:55.870
<v Speaker 3>bring like in camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a small package.</v>

3266
02:08:56.170 --> 02:08:58.620
<v Speaker 3>It's already sealed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a good size for,</v>

3267
02:08:58.630 --> 02:09:02.020
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy and you do it as like a rub</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the bobs on that thing.</v>

3268
02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:05.380
<v Speaker 3>Granted you're starving to death by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time you kill this animal and put out</v>

3269
02:09:05.381 --> 02:09:06.970
<v Speaker 3>the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it is off the hook.</v>

3270
02:09:07.210 --> 02:09:08.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we,</v>

3271
02:09:08.111 --> 02:09:09.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I hunted with Rinella the very</v>

3272
02:09:09.641 --> 02:09:13.570
<v Speaker 3>first time and shot a mule deer and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>we ate the liver that night,</v>

3273
02:09:13.571 --> 02:09:17.110
<v Speaker 3>we hung up most of the meat and tree</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was like pretty close to dark</v>

3274
02:09:17.470 --> 02:09:19.090
<v Speaker 3>and we went back the next day to pack it</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

3275
02:09:19.150 --> 02:09:20.050
<v Speaker 3>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3276
02:09:20.140 --> 02:09:22.900
<v Speaker 3>we went back to camp and ate liver and</v>
<v Speaker 3>onions,</v>

3277
02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:26.260
<v Speaker 3>like from an animal that died two hours</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

3278
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:29.320
<v Speaker 3>it was like the most insanely delicious</v>
<v Speaker 3>food I've ever had in my life.</v>

3279
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:31.150
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe how good it tastes.</v>

3280
02:09:31.151 --> 02:09:31.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were hunting.</v>

3281
02:09:31.661 --> 02:09:34.000
<v Speaker 3>Did you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys handed down from the ferry up</v>

3282
02:09:34.001 --> 02:09:35.010
<v Speaker 3>on the Missouri up there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3283
02:09:35.220 --> 02:09:36.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On a cheap in there a bunch.</v>

3284
02:09:36.521 --> 02:09:36.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3285
02:09:36.730 --> 02:09:37.140
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

3286
02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:39.760
<v Speaker 3>I saw a lot of sheep up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably pretty hard to get a tag</v>

3287
02:09:39.761 --> 02:09:40.250
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3288
02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:41.970
<v Speaker 3>Hardest place in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the brakes?</v>

3289
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3290
02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Hardest place in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get a tag.</v>

3291
02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:45.310
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

3292
02:09:45.370 --> 02:09:47.890
<v Speaker 3>They're just doing a really good job of</v>
<v Speaker 3>making sure the populations go up.</v>

3293
02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Biggest sheep in the world and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3294
02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:55.140
<v Speaker 3>they had giant balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We spent a whole segment of the show</v>

3295
02:09:56.140 --> 02:09:58.930
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on the balls of the sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Rinella.</v>

3296
02:09:58.931 --> 02:10:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Made a video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put as few as you can find this cause</v>

3297
02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:03.100
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3298
02:10:03.130 --> 02:10:05.650
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were there and Rinella like is</v>

3299
02:10:05.651 --> 02:10:08.860
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with these big horn sheep and</v>
<v Speaker 3>their balls.</v>

3300
02:10:09.010 --> 02:10:10.900
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moment I kill one of these things,</v>

3301
02:10:10.930 --> 02:10:12.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to kill it and I'm gonna take</v>

3359
02:12:55.611 --> 02:13:00.611
<v Speaker 3>amazing podcast where he details the</v>
<v Speaker 3>history of animals and European settlers</v>

3360
02:13:00.921 --> 02:13:04.640
<v Speaker 3>coming over here and the wiping out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the various animals and what's being</v>

3361
02:13:04.641 --> 02:13:06.650
<v Speaker 3>done to try to restore that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're primed.</v>

3362
02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:09.290
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to do something called</v>
<v Speaker 3>the American Serengeti where they're</v>

3363
02:13:09.291 --> 02:13:13.190
<v Speaker 3>trying to put together like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an area like a protected area,</v>

3364
02:13:13.191 --> 02:13:16.070
<v Speaker 3>like as big as yellowstone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's actually good involve</v>

3365
02:13:16.071 --> 02:13:17.310
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

3366
02:13:17.340 --> 02:13:20.050
<v Speaker 3>You're buying property right now in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Montana that's going on.</v>

3367
02:13:20.060 --> 02:13:23.330
<v Speaker 3>What's it going to be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that much about it.</v>

3368
02:13:23.331 --> 02:13:26.120
<v Speaker 3>I only just bought a property that's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>very far from where you guys were there</v>

3369
02:13:26.150 --> 02:13:27.650
<v Speaker 3>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3370
02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:29.570
<v Speaker 3>that there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in block management,</v>

3371
02:13:29.571 --> 02:13:30.680
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to hunt it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

3372
02:13:30.681 --> 02:13:31.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3373
02:13:31.410 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 3>I think they're pulling</v>

3374
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:34.860
<v Speaker 4>the cattle off it and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3375
02:13:34.890 --> 02:13:36.540
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a huge success story right there.</v>

3376
02:13:36.541 --> 02:13:36.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

3377
02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:38.870
<v Speaker 4>those sheep were planted back in there</v>
<v Speaker 4>in 1970s.</v>

3378
02:13:38.871 --> 02:13:43.470
<v Speaker 4>It's probably the biggest herd and in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Montana and certainly the best sheep</v>

3379
02:13:43.471 --> 02:13:46.080
<v Speaker 4>hunting in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were planted in there in the</v>

3380
02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:51.080
<v Speaker 4>70s and started hunting in about 1990.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They restarted hunting again.</v>

3381
02:13:51.311 --> 02:13:55.410
<v Speaker 4>And I mean they were totally brought</v>
<v Speaker 4>back from money from an auction tag,</v>

3382
02:13:55.770 --> 02:13:58.440
<v Speaker 4>but a transplant in there and they've</v>
<v Speaker 4>exploded onto the landscape.</v>

3383
02:13:58.441 --> 02:14:00.080
<v Speaker 4>They were shot out by mark and hunting</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3384
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:02.610
<v Speaker 4>and domestic sheep interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3385
02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:06.180
<v Speaker 4>years ago and then brought back and now</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the best place in the world,</v>

3386
02:14:06.181 --> 02:14:07.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that wouldn't happen.</v>

3387
02:14:07.090 --> 02:14:09.630
<v Speaker 4>A lot of hunters and is an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 4>success story.</v>

3388
02:14:09.930 --> 02:14:11.970
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an also an interesting thing.</v>

3389
02:14:11.971 --> 02:14:13.980
<v Speaker 4>These auction tags,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really weird,</v>

3390
02:14:14.250 --> 02:14:17.850
<v Speaker 4>where you let someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you give them this opportunity to hunt.</v>

3391
02:14:17.850 --> 02:14:21.000
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of times these guys are</v>
<v Speaker 4>spending hundreds of thousands of</v>

3392
02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:21.630
<v Speaker 4>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>

3393
02:14:21.630 --> 02:14:25.250
<v Speaker 4>The most expensive tag in history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>$485,000 right there.</v>

3394
02:14:25.270 --> 02:14:26.520
<v Speaker 4>Missouri breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3395
02:14:26.620 --> 02:14:27.870
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2013.</v>

3396
02:14:27.871 --> 02:14:29.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wanted those balls,</v>

3397
02:14:31.060 --> 02:14:32.340
<v Speaker 4>guy paid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

3398
02:14:32.341 --> 02:14:34.240
<v Speaker 4>there was a huge ram that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3399
02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:36.180
<v Speaker 4>a couple of hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three of us that,</v>

3400
02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:37.320
<v Speaker 4>that guy did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3401
02:14:37.321 --> 02:14:37.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>

3402
02:14:37.890 --> 02:14:38.671
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3403
02:14:38.671 --> 02:14:42.750
<v Speaker 4>like I paid $485 and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the money thing about that is really</v>

3404
02:14:42.780 --> 02:14:45.210
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this perception of some rich dude</v>

3405
02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:49.110
<v Speaker 4>like you're paying for an opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 4>bypass the system to do something that</v>

3406
02:14:49.111 --> 02:14:51.540
<v Speaker 4>you would normally have to draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's as simple as that.</v>

3407
02:14:51.541 --> 02:14:54.900
<v Speaker 4>It's not like I'm going to spend this</v>
<v Speaker 4>huge amount of money and you know,</v>

3408
02:14:54.901 --> 02:14:57.580
<v Speaker 4>it's this huge head hunt in this ego</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and he got guys live here.</v>

3409
02:14:57.581 --> 02:15:00.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean like there's so many</v>
<v Speaker 4>misconceptions about what goes on with</v>

3410
02:15:00.211 --> 02:15:02.130
<v Speaker 4>that type of thing that it's not even</v>
<v Speaker 4>funny.</v>

3411
02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:05.220
<v Speaker 4>It's a tax write off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a donation of wildlife if you</v>

3412
02:15:05.221 --> 02:15:09.540
<v Speaker 4>really care about wildlife and it gives</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy an opportunity to take,</v>

3413
02:15:09.541 --> 02:15:10.171
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

3414
02:15:10.171 --> 02:15:12.570
<v Speaker 4>if you're a billionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've made a ton of money and you</v>

3415
02:15:12.571 --> 02:15:14.430
<v Speaker 4>care about wildlife and you love to</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt,</v>

3416
02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:17.340
<v Speaker 4>why would you not do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that weird.</v>

3417
02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:20.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's all relative.</v>

3418
02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:22.380
<v Speaker 4>It's money and said donation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yes,</v>

3419
02:15:22.381 --> 02:15:23.550
<v Speaker 4>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had this big sheep,</v>

3420
02:15:23.551 --> 02:15:26.400
<v Speaker 4>he spent 18 days hunting and it's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>biggest one ever been killed with an</v>

3421
02:15:26.670 --> 02:15:30.270
<v Speaker 4>auction tag in the United States and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a phenomenal hunt and the guy you</v>

3422
02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:31.890
<v Speaker 4>know was glad to donate the money and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3423
02:15:31.891 --> 02:15:34.590
<v Speaker 4>you know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's provided new sheep transplants</v>

3424
02:15:34.591 --> 02:15:37.770
<v Speaker 4>money for wildlife that would not exist</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they didn't do it.</v>

3425
02:15:37.771 --> 02:15:39.660
<v Speaker 4>It's one tag and raise a half a million</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars.</v>

3426
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:43.350
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the big contradiction when</v>
<v Speaker 4>people talk about hunting and hunting</v>

3427
02:15:43.351 --> 02:15:45.910
<v Speaker 4>being for conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it helps conservation that.</v>

3428
02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:50.430
<v Speaker 4>That is one of the biggest examples of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is how much money goes into helping</v>

3429
02:15:50.431 --> 02:15:54.840
<v Speaker 4>these animals and habitat preservation</v>
<v Speaker 4>and reintroducing them to areas like</v>

3430
02:15:54.841 --> 02:15:58.380
<v Speaker 4>with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation</v>
<v Speaker 4>has done with reintroducing elk to a</v>

3431
02:15:58.381 --> 02:16:01.410
<v Speaker 4>bunch of different places is the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 4>success in North America.</v>

3432
02:16:01.411 --> 02:16:04.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean they were shot basically into a</v>
<v Speaker 4>few places and they've,</v>

3433
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:08.490
<v Speaker 4>they brought them back through and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>strongly been through money by guys that</v>

3434
02:16:08.491 --> 02:16:10.320
<v Speaker 4>are fortunate enough to be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3435
02:16:10.321 --> 02:16:12.090
<v Speaker 4>And it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a total misconception.</v>

3436
02:16:12.091 --> 02:16:15.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean you are paying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy is paying money as a tax</v>

3437
02:16:15.751 --> 02:16:19.890
<v Speaker 4>donation and he's giving money to</v>
<v Speaker 4>something he truly cares about that he</v>

3438
02:16:19.891 --> 02:16:21.660
<v Speaker 4>loves and has probably grown up doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

3439
02:16:21.870 --> 02:16:23.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy was self made,</v>

3440
02:16:23.161 --> 02:16:27.220
<v Speaker 4>started painting boards and West</v>
<v Speaker 4>Virginia and started a bank and made $1</v>

3441
02:16:27.220 --> 02:16:27.330
<v Speaker 4>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3442
02:16:27.330 --> 02:16:29.270
<v Speaker 4>like he loves hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what loves.</v>

3443
02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:31.140
<v Speaker 4>He was not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not some rich guy panda.</v>

3444
02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:33.390
<v Speaker 4>You don't put a head on his wall and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3445
02:16:33.391 --> 02:16:36.550
<v Speaker 4>and he was glad to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're paying for the opportunity.</v>

3446
02:16:36.551 --> 02:16:38.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that's always lost in it is,</v>

3447
02:16:38.410 --> 02:16:40.990
<v Speaker 4>is the dead animal or whatever the guy's</v>
<v Speaker 4>paying for the opportunity.</v>

3448
02:16:40.991 --> 02:16:44.890
<v Speaker 4>We had no advantage over anybody else</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the same season everybody else did.</v>

3449
02:16:45.310 --> 02:16:47.320
<v Speaker 4>And the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we ended up killing him,</v>

3450
02:16:47.380 --> 02:16:48.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a great big Ram,</v>

3451
02:16:48.701 --> 02:16:49.480
<v Speaker 4>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3452
02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:51.200
<v Speaker 4>obviously the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>

3453
02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:54.410
<v Speaker 4>one sheep raised a half a million</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars and does incredible and,</v>

3454
02:16:54.420 --> 02:16:56.430
<v Speaker 4>and a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was banned for the opportunity.</v>

3455
02:16:56.431 --> 02:16:57.264
<v Speaker 4>He's not paying for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3456
02:16:57.400 --> 02:16:59.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be a hell of lot easier to buy a</v>

3457
02:16:59.681 --> 02:17:03.610
<v Speaker 4>great big head to put on your wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it would to be to spend that much</v>

3458
02:17:03.611 --> 02:17:05.650
<v Speaker 4>money and then go out there and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>not get them.</v>

3459
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:07.740
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pursuit is,</v>

3460
02:17:08.390 --> 02:17:10.330
<v Speaker 4>is what drives and how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

3461
02:17:10.331 --> 02:17:12.130
<v Speaker 4>there's three guides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So do you,</v>

3462
02:17:12.131 --> 02:17:14.960
<v Speaker 4>did you guys scout in advance and find</v>
<v Speaker 4>those unique?</v>

3463
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:17.480
<v Speaker 4>Those are unique situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a son in,</v>

3464
02:17:17.490 --> 02:17:19.600
<v Speaker 4>in it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a basically a three year story of</v>

3465
02:17:19.601 --> 02:17:23.950
<v Speaker 4>following one ram Ram me called</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] 52 and in 2010,</v>

3466
02:17:24.010 --> 02:17:27.280
<v Speaker 4>a friend of ours was with a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 4>killed around,</v>

3467
02:17:27.690 --> 02:17:28.860
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>up in the breaks,</v>

3468
02:17:28.861 --> 02:17:30.640
<v Speaker 4>same deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exact same area you ran.</v>

3469
02:17:30.910 --> 02:17:32.590
<v Speaker 4>And there was a big ram standing with</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3470
02:17:32.591 --> 02:17:34.450
<v Speaker 4>There was two big rams together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>killed one of them.</v>

3471
02:17:34.900 --> 02:17:36.210
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

3472
02:17:37.450 --> 02:17:39.110
<v Speaker 4>the next year when we were up there</v>
<v Speaker 4>scouting,</v>

3473
02:17:39.140 --> 02:17:40.380
<v Speaker 4>we came across this ram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3474
02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:43.090
<v Speaker 4>that's the same ram in the photo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They took a photo right before they</v>

3475
02:17:43.091 --> 02:17:45.840
<v Speaker 4>killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we tried to hunt them in 2012.</v>

3476
02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:48.400
<v Speaker 4>Didn't get him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in 2013 it was like this,</v>

3477
02:17:48.401 --> 02:17:48.880
<v Speaker 4>this ram.</v>

3478
02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:51.070
<v Speaker 4>He was really big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he slipped through two years.</v>

3479
02:17:51.071 --> 02:17:53.200
<v Speaker 4>Nobody got him smart old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smart old sheet.</v>

3480
02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:54.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really smart.</v>

3481
02:17:55.300 --> 02:17:57.190
<v Speaker 4>And it was all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3482
02:17:57.191 --> 02:17:58.480
<v Speaker 4>we let a few guys know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3483
02:17:58.510 --> 02:18:02.170
<v Speaker 4>there's not an unusually big ram up</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

3484
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:04.390
<v Speaker 4>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want a chance to hunt it,</v>

3485
02:18:04.391 --> 02:18:07.630
<v Speaker 4>and it's unique in the timeframe and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that there's not always big sheep</v>

3486
02:18:07.631 --> 02:18:08.201
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3487
02:18:08.201 --> 02:18:09.550
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is one year.</v>

3488
02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:13.810
<v Speaker 4>This ram is alive right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we told a few guys and five guys</v>

3489
02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:14.470
<v Speaker 4>went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3490
02:18:14.470 --> 02:18:16.520
<v Speaker 4>there was five guys that are willing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay half a million dollars.</v>

3491
02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:17.081
<v Speaker 4>I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3492
02:18:17.081 --> 02:18:22.081
<v Speaker 4>there was five guys bid in over $460,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the opportunity to hunt this area.</v>

3493
02:18:25.090 --> 02:18:28.210
<v Speaker 4>Look at the size of that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

3494
02:18:28.330 --> 02:18:32.110
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The horns on that thing are insane.</v>

3495
02:18:33.250 --> 02:18:35.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will he edinger Al Mckinney and myself</v>

3496
02:18:35.591 --> 02:18:36.220
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3497
02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:38.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we spent 18 days like rattlesnakes out</v>

3498
02:18:38.951 --> 02:18:41.110
<v Speaker 4>there and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was an awesome hunt.</v>

3499
02:18:41.111 --> 02:18:41.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3500
02:18:41.540 --> 02:18:42.910
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a smart old ram.</v>

3501
02:18:42.911 --> 02:18:43.744
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3502
02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:46.690
<v Speaker 4>it was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a really cool deal and the guy and</v>

3503
02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:47.740
<v Speaker 4>we ended up getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3504
02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:51.520
<v Speaker 4>how far do you take it from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He almost killed it with a bow.</v>

3505
02:18:51.790 --> 02:18:53.950
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I snuck him into 12 yards,</v>

3506
02:18:54.370 --> 02:18:57.400
<v Speaker 4>came over the top on it and a resident</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunter,</v>

3507
02:18:57.820 --> 02:19:01.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a dick came down the ridge and</v>

3508
02:19:01.241 --> 02:19:05.470
<v Speaker 4>spooked the sheet that spotted us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knew we were hunting as sheep and came</v>

3509
02:19:05.471 --> 02:19:07.840
<v Speaker 4>down and spooked the ram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he should have killed it with a</v>

3510
02:19:07.841 --> 02:19:08.441
<v Speaker 4>bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

3511
02:19:08.441 --> 02:19:11.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean a hunter with a sheep tag where</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sheep tag.</v>

3512
02:19:11.650 --> 02:19:12.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do it on purpose.</v>

3513
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:14.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

3514
02:19:14.590 --> 02:19:17.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you saw three guys and you</v>

3515
02:19:17.681 --> 02:19:21.220
<v Speaker 4>knew that they had a guy with him that</v>
<v Speaker 4>had paid $485,000 to be there,</v>

3516
02:19:21.221 --> 02:19:21.970
<v Speaker 4>new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this,</v>

3517
02:19:21.970 --> 02:19:24.400
<v Speaker 4>you would probably think I'm probably in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right area.</v>

3518
02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:26.260
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these guys.</v>

3519
02:19:26.580 --> 02:19:27.413
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Shit.</v>

3520
02:19:27.660 --> 02:19:28.000
<v Speaker 4>But that's where</v>

3521
02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:29.450
<v Speaker 3>it gets weird with public land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3522
02:19:29.500 --> 02:19:31.760
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that Ram bugged out?</v>

3523
02:19:32.210 --> 02:19:35.540
<v Speaker 3>We killed him 10 days later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nine miles from where there and how far</v>

3524
02:19:35.541 --> 02:19:37.310
<v Speaker 3>was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shot when he killed him,</v>

3525
02:19:37.370 --> 02:19:38.960
<v Speaker 3>he shot him at four 60 that's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

3526
02:19:38.961 --> 02:19:39.920
<v Speaker 3>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another,</v>

3527
02:19:39.950 --> 02:19:41.330
<v Speaker 3>that's a different realm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn,</v>

3528
02:19:41.331 --> 02:19:46.100
<v Speaker 3>that thing's massing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tazy so I was fortunate to be on both of</v>

3529
02:19:46.101 --> 02:19:47.720
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's two of the top five sheep ever</v>

3530
02:19:47.721 --> 02:19:51.530
<v Speaker 3>killed Montana and 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are just majestic beasts.</v>

3531
02:19:51.531 --> 02:19:54.200
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what nature has given them in their</v>

3532
02:19:54.201 --> 02:19:58.220
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what a crazy animal that develop</v>

3533
02:19:58.221 --> 02:20:02.630
<v Speaker 3>these gigantic battering rams out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>top of their skull and the photos really</v>

3534
02:20:02.631 --> 02:20:05.000
<v Speaker 3>don't do those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just know you put your hands on those</v>

3535
02:20:05.001 --> 02:20:05.541
<v Speaker 3>horns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3536
02:20:05.541 --> 02:20:08.210
<v Speaker 3>it's impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both 11 and a half years old.</v>

3537
02:20:08.211 --> 02:20:09.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the end of his life.</v>

3538
02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:10.341
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3539
02:20:10.341 --> 02:20:12.440
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's running his full course that Ram</v>

3540
02:20:12.450 --> 02:20:15.850
<v Speaker 3>actually did not run at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Ram had a broken shoulder and we</v>

3541
02:20:15.851 --> 02:20:18.170
<v Speaker 3>had seen him for a couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a really small body and he was</v>

3542
02:20:18.171 --> 02:20:21.530
<v Speaker 3>actually a nondominant sheep and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just kind of floating around out</v>

3543
02:20:21.531 --> 02:20:22.190
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't really,</v>

3544
02:20:22.190 --> 02:20:23.510
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just physically,</v>

3545
02:20:23.570 --> 02:20:24.880
<v Speaker 3>physically past his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3546
02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:27.700
<v Speaker 3>So did you like fall or something or</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting accident?</v>

3547
02:20:27.701 --> 02:20:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to say.</v>

3548
02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:31.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have a tough life.</v>

3549
02:20:31.700 --> 02:20:33.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it's for an animal like that to</v>

3550
02:20:33.411 --> 02:20:36.440
<v Speaker 3>live that long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nature is so incredible and it's</v>

3551
02:20:36.441 --> 02:20:40.070
<v Speaker 3>diversity that this is something that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have here in North America,</v>

3552
02:20:40.071 --> 02:20:42.530
<v Speaker 3>this incredible animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a strange looking.</v>

3553
02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:45.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean almost [inaudible] we're so used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to them.</v>

3554
02:20:45.411 --> 02:20:48.500
<v Speaker 3>We know they exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think we kind of appreciate</v>

3555
02:20:48.501 --> 02:20:51.890
<v Speaker 3>them as much as if it were just</v>
<v Speaker 3>introduced to them as an adult.</v>

3556
02:20:51.890 --> 02:20:53.540
<v Speaker 3>If you'd never heard of or seen it</v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

3557
02:20:53.690 --> 02:20:55.460
<v Speaker 3>probably blow you away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

3558
02:20:55.650 --> 02:20:58.280
<v Speaker 3>But a crazy animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a battering ram on its</v>

3559
02:20:58.281 --> 02:20:59.300
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

3560
02:21:00.010 --> 02:21:03.350
<v Speaker 3>I always say like with desert sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know they had this tiny little neck</v>

3561
02:21:03.351 --> 02:21:05.450
<v Speaker 3>and it's like when you see one out in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the desert,</v>

3562
02:21:05.451 --> 02:21:06.800
<v Speaker 3>a desert sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big Ram,</v>

3563
02:21:06.801 --> 02:21:08.780
<v Speaker 3>it's like they wouldn't look any</v>
<v Speaker 3>stranger if they were green.</v>

3564
02:21:08.781 --> 02:21:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Like if they landed on Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they landed on Mars and all of a</v>

3565
02:21:11.751 --> 02:21:13.370
<v Speaker 3>sudden there was a desert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she popped his head up.</v>

3566
02:21:13.371 --> 02:21:15.170
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about what I thought it'd be here.</v>

3567
02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:19.940
<v Speaker 3>It's rocky and dry and his next this big</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's got a 50 pound head.</v>

3568
02:21:19.941 --> 02:21:22.730
<v Speaker 3>Like that's about what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen the video with the</v>

3569
02:21:22.731 --> 02:21:25.640
<v Speaker 3>ram and the cow?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buttheads I haven't.</v>

3570
02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Gerrymandering does a video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy video where this ram starts moving</v>

3571
02:21:30.801 --> 02:21:34.300
<v Speaker 3>towards this cow and the cows calf and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cow decides it's going to Headbutt</v>

3572
02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:36.500
<v Speaker 3>this ram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch this go full screen.</v>

3573
02:21:37.310 --> 02:21:41.510
<v Speaker 3>Check this out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch the ram comes in in division and</v>

3574
02:21:41.511 --> 02:21:44.120
<v Speaker 3>the cows like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck this so it sees it.</v>

3575
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:45.103
<v Speaker 3>Watch this.</v>

3576
02:21:48.270 --> 02:21:53.270
<v Speaker 3>The callout Chiodo and he gets up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell if that's a bull.</v>

3577
02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:55.200
<v Speaker 3>Is it a bull or a cow?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell them.</v>

3578
02:21:55.370 --> 02:21:58.150
<v Speaker 3>That's hard to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a blurry ass picture or blurry</v>

3579
02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:00.230
<v Speaker 3>video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just this tiny little thing</v>

3580
02:22:00.231 --> 02:22:02.000
<v Speaker 3>that weighs about 150 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cows,</v>

3581
02:22:02.090 --> 02:22:04.980
<v Speaker 3>not much more than a thousand and chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

3582
02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:06.630
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3583
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:11.180
<v Speaker 3>I've seen rams that had their skulls</v>
<v Speaker 3>broken entire horn torn off like that,</v>

3584
02:22:11.181 --> 02:22:13.140
<v Speaker 3>that amount of power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>

3585
02:22:13.141 --> 02:22:18.100
<v Speaker 3>they get up and when they hit and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like this state of right after gag</v>

3586
02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:21.530
<v Speaker 3>know where after you take a huge upper</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut and they just stand there and kind</v>

3587
02:22:21.531 --> 02:22:22.364
<v Speaker 3>of go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3588
02:22:23.060 --> 02:22:24.450
<v Speaker 3>and then they kind of come back and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3589
02:22:24.470 --> 02:22:25.530
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do that again.</v>

3590
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:27.660
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get enough of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got,</v>

3591
02:22:27.690 --> 02:22:29.220
<v Speaker 3>they've got cte.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3592
02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:29.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh for sure.</v>

3593
02:22:29.940 --> 02:22:31.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do a football study on them.</v>

3594
02:22:31.470 --> 02:22:32.303
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3595
02:22:32.650 --> 02:22:33.820
<v Speaker 3>You got to wonder like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did,</v>

3596
02:22:33.821 --> 02:22:37.410
<v Speaker 3>what crazy design that nature has</v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out a way to have all these</v>

3597
02:22:37.411 --> 02:22:38.800
<v Speaker 3>various different does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we go,</v>

3598
02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:41.630
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they just sit,</v>

3599
02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:44.340
<v Speaker 3>stand there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this collision.</v>

3600
02:22:44.910 --> 02:22:46.380
<v Speaker 3>That's when to make your stock right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then.</v>

3601
02:22:46.650 --> 02:22:48.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of these dummies needs to figure out</v>

3602
02:22:48.601 --> 02:22:51.060
<v Speaker 3>how to dive under and get an uppercut</v>
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>

3603
02:22:51.130 --> 02:22:52.200
<v Speaker 3>Get some leverage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3604
02:22:52.210 --> 02:22:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Just like don't head bottom to come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to Juco and then slide under.</v>

3605
02:22:57.210 --> 02:22:59.200
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the balls.</v>

3606
02:22:59.201 --> 02:23:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Big Horn sheep have two moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's this move right here.</v>

3607
02:23:02.581 --> 02:23:04.950
<v Speaker 3>And then when they're posturing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>kicking each other around their other</v>

3608
02:23:04.951 --> 02:23:06.570
<v Speaker 3>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get behind each other and smash</v>

3609
02:23:06.571 --> 02:23:07.680
<v Speaker 3>each other in the balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3610
02:23:08.640 --> 02:23:10.830
<v Speaker 3>the front kick to the is a big horn</v>
<v Speaker 3>sheep.</v>

3611
02:23:10.830 --> 02:23:12.470
<v Speaker 3>Look at the balls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the balls in these things.</v>

3612
02:23:12.480 --> 02:23:13.470
<v Speaker 3>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

3613
02:23:13.650 --> 02:23:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Look at these nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at these nuts.</v>

3614
02:23:16.050 --> 02:23:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Look at there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if I had nuts like that,</v>

3615
02:23:18.121 --> 02:23:19.890
<v Speaker 3>I'd never wear pants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

3616
02:23:19.891 --> 02:23:21.540
<v Speaker 3>everybody's just deal with what I've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

3617
02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:23.940
<v Speaker 3>That you wouldn't be doing a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe doing videos.</v>

3618
02:23:25.170 --> 02:23:29.320
<v Speaker 3>That'd be in the poem business son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that echoes for like the sheep I</v>

3619
02:23:29.321 --> 02:23:31.140
<v Speaker 3>hinted last fall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I actually found him.</v>

3620
02:23:31.430 --> 02:23:33.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear here in the middle of the</v>

3621
02:23:33.090 --> 02:23:34.010
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

3622
02:23:34.030 --> 02:23:36.750
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like gunshots going off real</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'd get up.</v>

3623
02:23:36.810 --> 02:23:37.760
<v Speaker 3>I got up and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3624
02:23:37.830 --> 02:23:40.290
<v Speaker 3>it took me four hours to figure it out</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they were because it echos all</v>

3625
02:23:40.291 --> 02:23:41.970
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can get about every 25 minutes</v>

3626
02:23:41.971 --> 02:23:44.640
<v Speaker 3>you'd hear boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just sounds just like a gunshot</v>

3627
02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:45.331
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3628
02:23:45.331 --> 02:23:47.460
<v Speaker 3>they're there and you start honing it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and boom,</v>

3629
02:23:47.461 --> 02:23:48.080
<v Speaker 3>there they were.</v>

3630
02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 Rams and they were butting heads.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty,</v>

3632
02:23:51.240 --> 02:23:52.800
<v Speaker 3>pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like little things like that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3634
02:23:55.111 --> 02:23:58.480

<v Speaker 3>you get to experience firsthand the</v>

3635
02:23:58.481 --> 02:24:01.170
<v Speaker 3>diversity of all these wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like mule deer with their</v>

3636
02:24:01.171 --> 02:24:06.171
<v Speaker 3>incredible racks or elk or or big horn</v>
<v Speaker 3>sheep and there's so many bizarre</v>

3637
02:24:06.181 --> 02:24:09.240
<v Speaker 3>creations and there's so much diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they hitting each other in the</v>

3638
02:24:09.241 --> 02:24:10.320
<v Speaker 3>balls?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get behind you and kick you</v>

3642
02:24:17.881 --> 02:24:18.440
<v Speaker 3>in the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3643
02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:18.731
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3644
02:24:18.731 --> 02:24:18.970
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3645
02:24:18.970 --> 02:24:19.980
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I already know that move</v>

3646
02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:26.040
<v Speaker 3>every time he's kicking the other sheep</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the balls.</v>

3647
02:24:26.450 --> 02:24:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Get five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you get kicked in the balls.</v>

3648
02:24:29.250 --> 02:24:30.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got no time.</v>

3649
02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:32.610
<v Speaker 3>No time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>

3650
02:24:32.730 --> 02:24:35.340
<v Speaker 3>They know that they have balls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they go to attack them.</v>

3651
02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:36.960
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck did they figure that out?</v>

3652
02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:39.720
<v Speaker 3>How do they know that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Balls or I guess they know that they</v>

3653
02:24:39.721 --> 02:24:41.250
<v Speaker 3>have balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have balls that big,</v>

3654
02:24:41.251 --> 02:24:44.400
<v Speaker 3>you're going to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something's going to hit those things.</v>

3655
02:24:44.570 --> 02:24:47.960
<v Speaker 3>But what a bunch of dickheads or magic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fascinating to.</v>

3656
02:24:47.980 --> 02:24:48.631
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3657
02:24:48.631 --> 02:24:49.580
<v Speaker 3>when they're in the Rut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3658
02:24:49.581 --> 02:24:51.780
<v Speaker 3>they're a totally different animal than</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're,</v>

3659
02:24:51.870 --> 02:24:52.800
<v Speaker 3>when the early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3660
02:24:52.801 --> 02:24:53.850
<v Speaker 3>when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they,</v>

3661
02:24:53.910 --> 02:24:57.360
<v Speaker 3>when they get late in the year and start</v>
<v Speaker 3>chasing like there's nothing,</v>

3662
02:24:57.361 --> 02:25:00.300
<v Speaker 3>they just go insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that also bizarre that they have a</v>

3663
02:25:00.301 --> 02:25:03.390
<v Speaker 3>season where they have to have sex where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you lose your mind?</v>

3664
02:25:03.391 --> 02:25:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once we got that too.</v>

3665
02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:07.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we get to do it all at all at</v>

3666
02:25:07.861 --> 02:25:10.200
<v Speaker 3>college and we can jerk off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3667
02:25:10.330 --> 02:25:12.750
<v Speaker 3>You can alleviate it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he could think clearly.</v>

3668
02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:14.560
<v Speaker 3>But these poor bastards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3669
02:25:14.561 --> 02:25:16.530
<v Speaker 3>all the wait all year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all year,</v>

3670
02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:17.580
<v Speaker 3>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go nuts.</v>

3671
02:25:18.270 --> 02:25:21.160
<v Speaker 3>Just getting ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No wonder they're balls are so big and</v>

3672
02:25:21.161 --> 02:25:23.040
<v Speaker 3>dearborn with weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

3673
02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:23.601
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3674
02:25:23.601 --> 02:25:24.820
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as they get older,</v>

3675
02:25:24.821 --> 02:25:26.650
<v Speaker 3>the more dominant ones of the bigger</v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons,</v>

3676
02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:29.860
<v Speaker 3>which is this what a strange system that</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature's figured out.</v>

3677
02:25:30.190 --> 02:25:31.060
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

3678
02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:33.880
<v Speaker 3>And it's also strange to me like how you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see when it's all over,</v>

3679
02:25:33.881 --> 02:25:36.370
<v Speaker 3>they bachelor up like when the ruts</v>
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>

3680
02:25:36.371 --> 02:25:38.680
<v Speaker 3>like we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went moose hunting and BC last year</v>

3681
02:25:38.860 --> 02:25:42.250
<v Speaker 3>and when the Rut was over we found these</v>
<v Speaker 3>like bachelor groups of Moose there</v>

3682
02:25:42.251 --> 02:25:43.930
<v Speaker 3>probably were trying to kill each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a couple of weeks.</v>

3683
02:25:43.931 --> 02:25:45.350
<v Speaker 3>We know how it is though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He beat up somebody.</v>

3684
02:25:45.370 --> 02:25:46.420
<v Speaker 3>Your best friends after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3685
02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:47.920
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3686
02:25:48.190 --> 02:25:49.690
<v Speaker 3>You don't bang his girlfriend either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3687
02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody has a claim on any</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>

3688
02:25:51.790 --> 02:25:53.800
<v Speaker 3>They're all just running around trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to try to score.</v>

3689
02:25:53.801 --> 02:25:56.530
<v Speaker 3>But I think when it's all over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're probably like,</v>

3690
02:25:56.531 --> 02:25:58.960
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what were we doing just a couple of</v>

3691
02:25:58.960 --> 02:25:59.793
<v Speaker 3>weeks ago?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3692
02:26:00.450 --> 02:26:02.590
<v Speaker 3>What came over us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they knew.</v>

3693
02:26:03.250 --> 02:26:05.290
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just strange that it comes over</v>

3694
02:26:05.291 --> 02:26:09.400
<v Speaker 3>them so strong here and it's so strong</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the rest of the time,</v>

3695
02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:13.000
<v Speaker 3>like a big Ram wants nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were,</v>

3696
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:16.390
<v Speaker 3>if your sheep hunting the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>year and you see in use,</v>

3697
02:26:16.450 --> 02:26:19.090
<v Speaker 3>you're in the wrong spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want nothing to do with them</v>

3698
02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:20.220
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't blame him.</v>

3699
02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:21.073
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same,</v>

3700
02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:23.200
<v Speaker 3>same with big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same a big bull elk and serve their</v>

3701
02:26:23.201 --> 02:26:24.270
<v Speaker 3>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same.</v>

3702
02:26:24.340 --> 02:26:25.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same with bullets.</v>

3703
02:26:25.690 --> 02:26:28.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aside from the Rut and a few times or</v>

3704
02:26:28.001 --> 02:26:31.090
<v Speaker 3>they interact the rest of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're seeing tons of counts,</v>

3705
02:26:31.091 --> 02:26:31.924
<v Speaker 3>you're in the wrong spot.</v>

3706
02:26:32.110 --> 02:26:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I told you about,</v>

3707
02:26:33.250 --> 02:26:35.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was in Montana and we saw a</v>

3708
02:26:35.890 --> 02:26:37.510
<v Speaker 3>hundred elk together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All cats this time.</v>

3709
02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:38.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3710
02:26:38.050 --> 02:26:38.950
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All cows.</v>

3711
02:26:38.980 --> 02:26:40.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're little spikes or something.</v>

3712
02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:41.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3713
02:26:41.350 --> 02:26:44.070
<v Speaker 3>I saw like one spike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

3714
02:26:44.210 --> 02:26:48.400
<v Speaker 3>it's so fascinating that diversity that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that nature's created so many different</v>

3715
02:26:48.401 --> 02:26:50.710
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that one hunting gives us the</v>

3716
02:26:50.711 --> 02:26:52.910
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to truly see it as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3717
02:26:52.930 --> 02:26:54.910
<v Speaker 3>There's like a national park or</v>
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone.</v>

3718
02:26:55.390 --> 02:26:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To see it as it is up close in its</v>

3719
02:26:58.211 --> 02:27:02.410
<v Speaker 3>natural habitat when it's quiet and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the sales thing the way it's been</v>

3720
02:27:02.411 --> 02:27:04.730
<v Speaker 3>for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it,</v>

3721
02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:07.960
<v Speaker 3>don't you feel like when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you sneak up on an animal too and</v>

3722
02:27:07.961 --> 02:27:08.320
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3723
02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:10.280
<v Speaker 3>you lock eyes with that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it almost,</v>

3724
02:27:10.380 --> 02:27:13.240
<v Speaker 3>you almost feel like you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it almost feels like a different</v>

3725
02:27:13.241 --> 02:27:14.680
<v Speaker 3>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all like that.</v>

3726
02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:17.770
<v Speaker 3>He gets your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in this world that they exist in</v>

3727
02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:19.960
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no cell phone service.</v>

3728
02:27:19.961 --> 02:27:23.590
<v Speaker 3>There's no people anywhere near you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very strange environment.</v>

3729
02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:24.970
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

3730
02:27:24.971 --> 02:27:27.220
<v Speaker 3>And it's like everything else gets tuned</v>
<v Speaker 3>out too.</v>

3731
02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:31.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like this laser focus of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what's happening right then all your</v>

3732
02:27:31.091 --> 02:27:32.650
<v Speaker 3>senses go way up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3733
02:27:32.651 --> 02:27:36.160
<v Speaker 3>at least for me as far as smell and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can feel the slightest breeze in</v>

3734
02:27:36.161 --> 02:27:38.380
<v Speaker 3>your face and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3735
02:27:38.381 --> 02:27:40.660
<v Speaker 3>you can see that at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna move really,</v>

3736
02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:44.740
<v Speaker 3>really close like you'd never would</v>
<v Speaker 3>notice before because of that laser</v>

3737
02:27:44.741 --> 02:27:48.170
<v Speaker 3>focus intensity just kind of takes over</v>
<v Speaker 3>your whole system and there's some of us</v>

3738
02:27:48.171 --> 02:27:49.720
<v Speaker 3>stock on something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about tricking an</v>

3739
02:27:49.721 --> 02:27:53.110
<v Speaker 3>animal that's whole focus in life is to</v>
<v Speaker 3>not get caught.</v>

3740
02:27:53.620 --> 02:27:57.340
<v Speaker 3>That is a great sense of feeling like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do everything right in the right</v>

3741
02:27:57.341 --> 02:28:00.820
<v Speaker 3>place and this thing walks by and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh and an Arrow was already on the way.</v>

3742
02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:03.070
<v Speaker 3>It's done deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you did it.</v>

3743
02:28:03.100 --> 02:28:03.671
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3744
02:28:03.671 --> 02:28:07.720
<v Speaker 3>you outsmarted something that's 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>million years where the genetics and</v>

3745
02:28:07.721 --> 02:28:08.554
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to fear,</v>

3746
02:28:08.830 --> 02:28:11.500
<v Speaker 3>especially with bow hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you got it in that close and got</v>

3747
02:28:11.501 --> 02:28:12.430
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You not only that,</v>

3748
02:28:12.431 --> 02:28:14.480
<v Speaker 3>we're clumsy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our noses sock,</v>

3749
02:28:14.530 --> 02:28:17.500
<v Speaker 3>we can't see very good things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dog Shit.</v>

3750
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:21.440
<v Speaker 3>They have ears like satellite dishes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're spinning around left and right.</v>

3751
02:28:21.441 --> 02:28:24.470
<v Speaker 3>Looking all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to find you a mule deer in</v>

3752
02:28:24.471 --> 02:28:25.320
<v Speaker 3>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3753
02:28:25.430 --> 02:28:27.350
<v Speaker 3>those giant ears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well and their nose.</v>

3754
02:28:27.410 --> 02:28:28.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3755
02:28:28.750 --> 02:28:30.800
<v Speaker 3>The power sent this crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3756

<v Speaker 3>farthest distances.</v>

3757
02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:37.520
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds of yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck this done.</v>

3758
02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:40.900
<v Speaker 3>What do you think the wind's blowing at</v>
<v Speaker 3>your back or on your face?</v>

3759
02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:43.430
<v Speaker 3>It's actually going around the mountain</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ends up right back at it.</v>

3760
02:28:43.431 --> 02:28:44.860
<v Speaker 3>It's just amazing what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>defenseless animal eating defenseless.</v>

<v Speaker 3>from hunters.</v>

3778
02:29:18.660 --> 02:29:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Hunters walk right by him like within</v>
<v Speaker 3>yards and just do some really cool</v>

3786
02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:40.010
<v Speaker 3>Just imagine if you were a 300 pound</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal that had escaped some them</v>

3787

<v Speaker 3>killing you all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your every day is try to get some</v>

02:29:43.371 --> 02:29:48.050
<v Speaker 3>grass and your system and get the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>away from everything that wants to try</v>

3789
02:29:48.051 --> 02:29:51.200
<v Speaker 3>and get laid once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Polygamist yeah,</v>

3790
02:29:51.201 --> 02:29:52.200
<v Speaker 3>definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3791
02:29:52.280 --> 02:29:55.160
<v Speaker 3>you're sleeping outside in Montana in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the winter.</v>

3792
02:29:56.220 --> 02:29:57.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3793
02:29:57.890 --> 02:30:02.780
<v Speaker 3>I think it's amazing and we're so lucky</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this country that the people like</v>

3794
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:05.000
<v Speaker 3>Teddy Roosevelt and the people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>founded these,</v>

3795
02:30:05.330 --> 02:30:10.330
<v Speaker 3>these areas for public land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they set them aside and I'll allow these</v>

3796
02:30:10.371 --> 02:30:13.100
<v Speaker 3>places to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be established with these animals can</v>

3797
02:30:13.101 --> 02:30:16.640
<v Speaker 3>live and we never have to worry about</v>
<v Speaker 3>them being taken over and they built</v>

3798
02:30:16.641 --> 02:30:17.690
<v Speaker 3>malls there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3799
02:30:17.720 --> 02:30:19.610
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a really beautiful part of America.</v>

3800
02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:22.250
<v Speaker 3>Even if you don't have any desire</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever to hunt.</v>

3801
02:30:22.490 --> 02:30:27.440
<v Speaker 3>The fact that you can go up there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>backpack and camp and be in that natural</v>

3802
02:30:27.441 --> 02:30:29.060
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a really beautiful thing about</v>

3803
02:30:29.061 --> 02:30:29.894
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

3804
02:30:30.260 --> 02:30:30.801
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3805
02:30:30.801 --> 02:30:33.020
<v Speaker 3>the perception of hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just out there to kill something.</v>

3806
02:30:33.130 --> 02:30:34.310
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

3807
02:30:34.311 --> 02:30:37.160
<v Speaker 3>it's a small part of the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good part though.</v>

3808
02:30:37.490 --> 02:30:40.880
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's be an outfit too and it is</v>

3809
02:30:40.881 --> 02:30:44.450
<v Speaker 3>definitely good experience all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously I wouldn't be there</v>

3810
02:30:44.451 --> 02:30:46.430
<v Speaker 3>without a tag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get invited to go hiking or go to a</v>

3811
02:30:46.431 --> 02:30:48.400
<v Speaker 3>park all the time or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>National Party man,</v>

3812
02:30:48.410 --> 02:30:50.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean it's uh,</v>

3813
02:30:50.660 --> 02:30:52.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean being out in the mountains and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wilderness and seeing all this stuff</v>

3814
02:30:52.911 --> 02:30:54.380
<v Speaker 3>is just awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3815
02:30:54.381 --> 02:30:56.450
<v Speaker 3>It's not like if you go hunting and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>unsuccessful,</v>

3816
02:30:56.451 --> 02:30:59.570
<v Speaker 3>it's a zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a sentence that's like a six</v>

3817
02:30:59.571 --> 02:31:00.560
<v Speaker 3>out of 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

3818
02:31:00.580 --> 02:31:02.980
<v Speaker 3>if you get a big elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a 10 but if you,</v>

3819
02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:08.000
<v Speaker 3>if you go out there and nothing happens</v>
<v Speaker 3>like us hiking's a four so it's two</v>

3820
02:31:08.331 --> 02:31:10.220
<v Speaker 3>points above a hike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hiking,</v>

3821
02:31:10.221 --> 02:31:11.960
<v Speaker 3>we call it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you actually see the</v>

3822
02:31:11.961 --> 02:31:13.400
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't see the animals,</v>

3823
02:31:13.401 --> 02:31:15.320
<v Speaker 3>it's like a five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't see anything,</v>

3824
02:31:15.380 --> 02:31:16.970
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck were we doing in this box?</v>

3825
02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:18.620
<v Speaker 3>If you don't see anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need new friends.</v>

3826
02:31:19.410 --> 02:31:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3827
02:31:20.030 --> 02:31:23.430
<v Speaker 4>Somebody somebodies been lying to you or</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just,</v>

3828
02:31:23.431 --> 02:31:24.600
<v Speaker 4>something happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3829
02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:27.000
<v Speaker 4>you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now these big horn sheep,</v>

3830
02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:29.790
<v Speaker 4>they're very difficult to get a tag for</v>
<v Speaker 4>right in Montana.</v>

3831
02:31:29.791 --> 02:31:32.590
<v Speaker 4>Like there's so many of them now though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3832
02:31:32.700 --> 02:31:33.211
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3833
02:31:33.211 --> 02:31:34.890
<v Speaker 4>but I mean there's still not enough to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go around.</v>

3834
02:31:34.891 --> 02:31:35.790
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the most,</v>

3835
02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:37.620
<v Speaker 4>it's the most exclusive tag in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

3836
02:31:37.621 --> 02:31:40.650
<v Speaker 4>How many do they give out in Montana to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get about 150 a year?</v>

3837
02:31:40.651 --> 02:31:42.510
<v Speaker 4>I drew one last year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

3838
02:31:42.750 --> 02:31:47.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean the odds in the best place at</v>
<v Speaker 4>like one in 500 it's a lottery system.</v>

3839
02:31:47.610 --> 02:31:50.820
<v Speaker 4>And then the lodge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in the roughest areas that have</v>

3840
02:31:50.821 --> 02:31:55.080
<v Speaker 4>better odds are like one in 101 and 500</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's incredible.</v>

3841
02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:58.680
<v Speaker 4>So Brennan drew a sheep tag or Montana</v>
<v Speaker 4>to hunt one sheep.</v>

3842
02:31:58.920 --> 02:32:01.500
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had one unit?</v>

3843
02:32:01.570 --> 02:32:03.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he showed me the picture of it when he</v>

3844
02:32:03.571 --> 02:32:05.070
<v Speaker 4>drew the tag goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to kill the sheep.</v>

3845
02:32:05.130 --> 02:32:06.710
<v Speaker 4>How did you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>About the show?</v>

3846
02:32:06.711 --> 02:32:08.190
<v Speaker 4>That he killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sheeps dead?</v>

3847
02:32:08.310 --> 02:32:09.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a savage.</v>

3848
02:32:09.940 --> 02:32:10.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like the,</v>

3849
02:32:10.850 --> 02:32:12.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm so glad I'm not that cheap right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

3850
02:32:13.050 --> 02:32:14.430
<v Speaker 4>When you do that tag,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they,</v>

3851
02:32:14.490 --> 02:32:18.000
<v Speaker 4>when they lose their mind once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they come out to the winter range and a</v>

3852
02:32:18.001 --> 02:32:21.060
<v Speaker 4>buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Robbie doctor had found this ram on the</v>

3853
02:32:21.061 --> 02:32:24.240
<v Speaker 4>winter range and she sent me a picture</v>
<v Speaker 4>of it and said,</v>

3854
02:32:24.420 --> 02:32:25.400
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3855
02:32:25.530 --> 02:32:28.880
<v Speaker 4>this is a huge ram in an unusual area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3856
02:32:28.940 --> 02:32:29.940
<v Speaker 4>we applied for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3857
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:31.260
<v Speaker 4>it's happened before like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3858
02:32:31.261 --> 02:32:32.490
<v Speaker 4>there's a big sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows that.</v>

3859
02:32:32.491 --> 02:32:35.280
<v Speaker 4>We didn't tell anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he showed up again the next</v>

3860
02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:36.120
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't draw the tag.</v>

3861
02:32:36.450 --> 02:32:39.270
<v Speaker 4>And then last year I drew it and it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I drew the tag and I was like,</v>

3862
02:32:39.271 --> 02:32:41.940
<v Speaker 4>he's on the outer edge of the life</v>
<v Speaker 4>expectancy of a sheep.</v>

3863
02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:44.250
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a 500 square mile area.</v>

3864
02:32:44.251 --> 02:32:48.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm going in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as it takes 500 square miles,</v>

3865
02:32:48.541 --> 02:32:51.330
<v Speaker 4>the Hud one sheet mindblowing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty great.</v>

3866
02:32:51.340 --> 02:32:52.290
<v Speaker 4>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3867
02:32:52.291 --> 02:32:53.910
<v Speaker 4>that is the ultimate pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3868
02:32:53.920 --> 02:32:57.510
<v Speaker 4>While talking about the most difficult</v>
<v Speaker 4>challenge of hunting with a bow.</v>

3869
02:32:57.660 --> 02:32:59.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many are you getting from,</v>

3870
02:32:59.790 --> 02:33:03.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just outside my effective range?</v>

3871
02:33:03.330 --> 02:33:05.820
<v Speaker 4>Long shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I snuck in,</v>

3872
02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:09.070
<v Speaker 4>I snuck in at 15 yards for 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took me 24 days to find him.</v>

3873
02:33:09.090 --> 02:33:11.910
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I passed up 33 eight year old or better</v>

3874
02:33:11.911 --> 02:33:13.600
<v Speaker 4>rams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two days you spent scouting to,</v>

3875
02:33:14.130 --> 02:33:16.380
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I lost track of time.</v>

3876
02:33:16.381 --> 02:33:17.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean I put,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put on,</v>

3877
02:33:17.610 --> 02:33:20.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a crazy amount of job.</v>

3878
02:33:20.011 --> 02:33:21.210
<v Speaker 4>Do you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all need one of those.</v>

3879
02:33:22.590 --> 02:33:24.330
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said he's like,</v>

3880
02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:25.730
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

3881
02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:26.471
<v Speaker 4>when I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

3882
02:33:26.471 --> 02:33:28.500
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I drew the tag and like I was emotional.</v>

3883
02:33:28.500 --> 02:33:30.600
<v Speaker 4>I drew it like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean people don't understand like,</v>

3884
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:31.650
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to tag the hunt.</v>

3885
02:33:31.651 --> 02:33:36.651
<v Speaker 4>This thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like 25 years in a row of knows how</v>

3886
02:33:36.751 --> 02:33:39.660
<v Speaker 4>many people put in for the tag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's 150 tags available.</v>

3887
02:33:39.661 --> 02:33:42.090
<v Speaker 4>So we just 150 tags in the whole state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole state.</v>

3888
02:33:42.091 --> 02:33:44.430
<v Speaker 4>And how many people in this area?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two tags.</v>

3889
02:33:44.730 --> 02:33:48.480
<v Speaker 4>So you got one of two to 220 people</v>
<v Speaker 4>applied for two tags.</v>

3890
02:33:48.481 --> 02:33:49.460
<v Speaker 4>And I drew one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It was like amazing.</v>

3893
02:33:53.521 --> 02:33:57.450
<v Speaker 4>had showed up on the winter range and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then disappeared into this abyss called</v>

3894
02:33:57.451 --> 02:33:59.340
<v Speaker 4>the Bob Marshall Wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

3895

02:34:05.710 --> 02:34:08.430
<v Speaker 4>I 124 days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of scouting days you had was like</v>

3899
02:34:08.431 --> 02:34:09.450
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3900
02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:12.400
<v Speaker 4>So you're going back and getting food</v>
<v Speaker 4>and going back to him soon.</v>

3901
02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:15.240
<v Speaker 4>Four or five days at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like all good things,</v>

3902
02:34:15.300 --> 02:34:17.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all the most amazing things.</v>

3903
02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:18.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>timing is kind of a bitch.</v>

3904
02:34:18.971 --> 02:34:23.350
<v Speaker 4>We had a baby due</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the middle of my wife.</v>

3905
02:34:23.351 --> 02:34:26.860
<v Speaker 4>We're fucking kill him right out there</v>
<v Speaker 4>chasing one if did you see any of the</v>

3906
02:34:26.861 --> 02:34:27.341
<v Speaker 4>rams?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3907
02:34:27.341 --> 02:34:30.340
<v Speaker 4>but there wasn't quite big enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Third,</v>

3908
02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:34.180
<v Speaker 4>a third 33 I passed up 33 rounds before</v>
<v Speaker 4>I push.</v>

3909
02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:37.920
<v Speaker 4>Hold on a solid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3910
02:34:40.430 --> 02:34:41.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3911
02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:44.050
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was after this one cheap and I</v>

3912
02:34:44.051 --> 02:34:45.730
<v Speaker 4>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

3913
02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:47.650
<v Speaker 4>like when you talk about really getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>to know animals,</v>

3914
02:34:47.651 --> 02:34:50.860
<v Speaker 4>he had showed up on the winter range and</v>
<v Speaker 4>twice we had pictures of him two years</v>

3915
02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:52.510
<v Speaker 4>around on the winter range.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's just like,</v>

3916
02:34:52.511 --> 02:34:53.770
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got a picture of this big ramp.</v>

3917
02:34:54.250 --> 02:34:56.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I started looking at the pictures</v>

3918
02:34:56.150 --> 02:35:01.150
<v Speaker 4>and comparing them and all of a sudden I</v>
<v Speaker 4>noticed that in in one picture from 2013</v>

3919
02:35:01.900 --> 02:35:06.900
<v Speaker 4>or from 2012 and one in 2013 he had the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same two young rams with them a year</v>

3920
02:35:07.751 --> 02:35:10.060
<v Speaker 4>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 miles apart in distance,</v>

3921
02:35:10.090 --> 02:35:12.460
<v Speaker 4>and he had the same two sheep with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So all of a sudden I'm like,</v>

3922
02:35:13.030 --> 02:35:14.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people would be like,</v>

3923
02:35:14.140 --> 02:35:14.900
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a sheep.</v>

3924
02:35:14.900 --> 02:35:18.280
<v Speaker 4>And it was a little half curl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a young kind of unique</v>

3925
02:35:18.281 --> 02:35:20.980
<v Speaker 4>look and ran with them and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same room.</v>

3926
02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:23.740
<v Speaker 4>So all of a sudden I got a Ram band that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking for there.</v>

3927
02:35:23.980 --> 02:35:25.780
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a symbiotic relationship.</v>

3928
02:35:25.781 --> 02:35:30.130
<v Speaker 4>Young rams allow old rams or old rams</v>
<v Speaker 4>allow young rams to follow them around.</v>

3929
02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:33.010
<v Speaker 4>They show him kind of the hills and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of tolerate them.</v>

3930
02:35:33.011 --> 02:35:34.210
<v Speaker 4>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3931
02:35:34.330 --> 02:35:36.670
<v Speaker 4>you're my buddy or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just kind of like when when the</v>

3932
02:35:36.940 --> 02:35:40.300
<v Speaker 4>census start to slip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll see old rams with young rams and</v>

3933
02:35:40.330 --> 02:35:41.920
<v Speaker 4>they're keeping an eye on their back for</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

3934
02:35:41.921 --> 02:35:46.750
<v Speaker 4>And I see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I figured out this Ram who was 13</v>

3935
02:35:46.751 --> 02:35:48.160
<v Speaker 4>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the oldest,</v>

3936
02:35:48.430 --> 02:35:51.340
<v Speaker 4>so I end up killing him obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was 13 years old,</v>

3937
02:35:51.341 --> 02:35:54.430
<v Speaker 4>which is the oldest ram killed the whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>state of 150 by two years.</v>

3938
02:35:54.490 --> 02:35:57.130
<v Speaker 4>So he's beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's off the charts old.</v>

3939
02:35:57.520 --> 02:35:59.370
<v Speaker 4>So he had these two young rams with him.</v>

3940
02:35:59.370 --> 02:36:00.940
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I I,</v>

3941
02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:03.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically you have known enough about</v>

3942
02:36:03.101 --> 02:36:04.090
<v Speaker 4>she behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3943
02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:06.040
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking for this old ram and this</v>

3944
02:36:06.041 --> 02:36:08.080
<v Speaker 4>massive area,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm actually looking for three sheet</v>

3945
02:36:08.081 --> 02:36:11.080
<v Speaker 4>because if I see either of those two</v>
<v Speaker 4>young rams without him,</v>

3946
02:36:11.081 --> 02:36:13.870
<v Speaker 4>I'll know he's dead and it makes a big</v>
<v Speaker 4>difference in 500 square miles.</v>

3947
02:36:13.871 --> 02:36:15.850
<v Speaker 4>Look for three sheet versus one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently.</v>

3948
02:36:15.870 --> 02:36:18.310
<v Speaker 4>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I still retain.</v>

3949
02:36:18.330 --> 02:36:20.950
<v Speaker 4>So I went in there and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go find every sheep and the</v>

3950
02:36:20.951 --> 02:36:22.660
<v Speaker 4>entire unit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I went in there and I found,</v>

3951
02:36:22.690 --> 02:36:26.350
<v Speaker 4>I thoroughly believe that I found every</v>
<v Speaker 4>single sheep in there.</v>

3952
02:36:26.351 --> 02:36:29.770
<v Speaker 4>I counted almost 50 more sheep than the</v>
<v Speaker 4>biologist thought was alive in there.</v>

3953
02:36:31.530 --> 02:36:34.810
<v Speaker 4>And</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you take photos of these?</v>

3954
02:36:35.020 --> 02:36:36.840
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bottle to the biologists.</v>

3955
02:36:36.890 --> 02:36:37.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3956
02:36:37.811 --> 02:36:39.610
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's kind of changed his management plan</v>

3957
02:36:39.611 --> 02:36:40.420
<v Speaker 4>in the area a little bit.</v>

3958
02:36:40.420 --> 02:36:42.650
<v Speaker 4>Like he knows more about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

3959
02:36:44.130 --> 02:36:47.500
<v Speaker 4>it's like I went in there because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3960
02:36:47.501 --> 02:36:49.330
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since I was a little kid,</v>

3961
02:36:49.331 --> 02:36:49.931
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3962
02:36:49.931 --> 02:36:52.840
<v Speaker 4>that's something I always wanted to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you're going to get this</v>

3963
02:36:52.841 --> 02:36:53.650
<v Speaker 4>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

3964
02:36:53.650 --> 02:36:54.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to go do the easiest</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

3965
02:36:54.921 --> 02:36:56.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I passed big rams,</v>

3966
02:36:56.201 --> 02:36:58.780
<v Speaker 4>a big rams of my bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I wanted this ram.</v>

3967
02:36:58.781 --> 02:37:02.080
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to have like an epic con and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to see if I could do it,</v>

3968
02:37:02.081 --> 02:37:04.180
<v Speaker 4>see if I could find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3969
02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:07.240
<v Speaker 4>and I hadn't found those young rams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And on the 23rd day,</v>

3970
02:37:07.330 --> 02:37:09.790
<v Speaker 4>I said it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>heard him pop and heads started glass</v>

3971
02:37:09.791 --> 02:37:11.560
<v Speaker 4>and cutting the timber apart and all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sudden,</v>

3972
02:37:12.050 --> 02:37:13.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another key to the puzzle.</v>

3973
02:37:13.930 --> 02:37:16.160
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden there's that little</v>
<v Speaker 4>young ram that was with</v>

3974
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:17.900
<v Speaker 3>him standing in the timber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

3975
02:37:17.901 --> 02:37:21.170
<v Speaker 3>I got him go down there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 10 rams in there and my ram</v>

3976
02:37:21.171 --> 02:37:21.981
<v Speaker 3>walks out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's him.</v>

3977
02:37:21.981 --> 02:37:23.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took me two days to kill him,</v>

3978
02:37:23.391 --> 02:37:25.870
<v Speaker 3>but I found them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you doing all this by yourself?</v>

3979
02:37:25.920 --> 02:37:26.611
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>

3980
02:37:26.611 --> 02:37:30.530
<v Speaker 3>I had my buddy that originally found the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sheep when I found the rams,</v>

3981
