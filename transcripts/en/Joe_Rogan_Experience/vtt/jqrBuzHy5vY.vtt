<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>We had some technical difficulties.</v>

7
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Let's try it again.</v>

8
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.740
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

10
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.100
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>

11
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.790
<v Speaker 1>welcome.</v>

12
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for coming here.</v>

13
00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:17.111
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

14
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:17.351
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

15
00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:19.000
<v Speaker 1>So what we were saying before,</v>

16
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.860
<v Speaker 1>we actually said this already,</v>

17
00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:22.630
<v Speaker 1>but let's say it again because the people didn't hear it.</v>

18
00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

19
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>you were one of the pioneers of standup comedy in Brazil.</v>

20
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

21
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.431
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>

22
00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:30.400
<v Speaker 1>I started with like four or five guys.</v>

23
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.680
<v Speaker 1>We started doing it like 16,</v>

24
00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>17 years ago and uh,</v>

25
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.150
<v Speaker 1>nobody knew about stand up.</v>

26
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.420
<v Speaker 1>It was something that I found out when I came here to live and play basketball.</v>

27
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 1>I had a scholarship to play basketball and I watched Jim Gaffigan oh wow.</v>

28
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.320
<v Speaker 1>And Brian Regan.</v>

29
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

30
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I know those guys.</v>

31
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.300
<v Speaker 1>And I thought it was so weird because those guys were like,</v>

32
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.530
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

33
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.520
<v Speaker 1>I was questioning his,</v>

34
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 1>does he call his name?</v>

35
00:00:57.851 --> 00:01:02.851
<v Speaker 1>Brian Regan does heat is actually him because we used to have characters and</v>

36
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:04.420
<v Speaker 1>impersonators.</v>

37
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.730
<v Speaker 1>So he was kind of weird.</v>

38
00:01:06.731 --> 00:01:07.391
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

39
00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:11.350
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting because I'm not a guy who those characters and I do</v>

40
00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>observations and I ride.</v>

41
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>It was a journalism degree in journalism.</v>

42
00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 1>So it was interesting for me to see those guys doing comedy and I thought we</v>

43
00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>could do the same in my country.</v>

44
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy that it took that long for it to get to Brazil.</v>

45
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>You would think that because everything else,</v>

46
00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:25.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

47
00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>you guys have movies and you know,</v>

48
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:28.121
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean city of God,</v>

50
00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:30.430
<v Speaker 1>you have action movies.</v>

51
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:31.264
<v Speaker 1>You're always,</v>

52
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.010
<v Speaker 1>you have so much that's so similar.</v>

53
00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>The fact that standup comedy made it there is so unusual to a,</v>

54
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.720
<v Speaker 1>it took a long time.</v>

55
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.623
<v Speaker 1>A was,</v>

56
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why,</v>

57
00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>but the image of a comedian speaking like with a blazer or a suit or something</v>

58
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.403
<v Speaker 1>was Jerry Seinfeld,</v>

59
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 1>very American,</v>

60
00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:48.034
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.210
<v Speaker 1>and those jokes,</v>

62
00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:51.850
<v Speaker 1>did they actually connect them much with us?</v>

63
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

64
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

65
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.230
<v Speaker 1>I have those buckets.</v>

66
00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>And it was something that we have bigger problems than,</v>

67
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.431
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

68
00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:58.420
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of a pocket.</v>

69
00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>I pulled my band.</v>

70
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.523
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

71
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.030
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

72
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>it was something that I could,</v>

73
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.000
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't connect them much,</v>

74
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>but when we,</v>

75
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.550
<v Speaker 1>when we saw there was another people doing other stuff and that was like this</v>

76
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 1>huge role that we could actually explore,</v>

77
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.710
<v Speaker 1>that was when it become interesting for us.</v>

78
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.150
<v Speaker 1>So comedy in Brazil,</v>

79
00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:17.890
<v Speaker 1>they would basically be like a,</v>

80
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.870
<v Speaker 1>like say if I was a Brazilian comedian,</v>

81
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.770
<v Speaker 1>I would come up with a fake name if you would.</v>

82
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.200
<v Speaker 1>And I would do a character.</v>

83
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll wig wig,</v>

84
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll wear a certain outfit,</v>

85
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.070
<v Speaker 1>outfit like a very over the top screaming.</v>

86
00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:30.904
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

87
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.020
<v Speaker 1>in that steel steel exists in Brazil.</v>

88
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.380
<v Speaker 1>This is like a popular fourth of the people stand up.</v>

89
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that it's for everyone.</v>

90
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Now I have my Netflix Bash,</v>

91
00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:43.120
<v Speaker 1>shall we be?</v>

92
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.070
<v Speaker 1>It's becoming huge because,</v>

93
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.851
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:02:45.851 --> 00:02:48.850
<v Speaker 1>we have some other options right now with the Internet.</v>

95
00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:49.661
<v Speaker 1>Everything changed.</v>

96
00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:50.920
<v Speaker 1>The game changed completely.</v>

97
00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:51.754
<v Speaker 1>So we have,</v>

98
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.540
<v Speaker 1>what is good has his own space right now.</v>

100
00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not only what the TV ones,</v>

101
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.300
<v Speaker 1>she used to watch it.</v>

102
00:02:58.301 --> 00:03:00.320
<v Speaker 1>So the changed a little for,</v>

103
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>for all of us.</v>

104
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>So how did you start out?</v>

105
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:07.801
<v Speaker 1>Did you start out by going to music clubs or he was actually standing there,</v>

106
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 1>a BDSM club.</v>

107
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Sadomasochist really?</v>

108
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.210
<v Speaker 1>I remember that there was like pictures of Cox in the back and leg of a giant.</v>

109
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.010
<v Speaker 1>It was a huge vaginas and we have it.</v>

110
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>And we had that show and he was,</v>

111
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't good,</v>

112
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>but is it was an experience for all of us to go on stage and try to,</v>

113
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

114
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.610
<v Speaker 1>to show them our opinions and our jokes and some irony and sarcasm we wish,</v>

115
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>which was something that people wasn't watching,</v>

116
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

117
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 1>but then it becomes,</v>

118
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>he becomes something huge.</v>

119
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>We got chances to go to TV and everything else.</v>

120
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>But at first it was difficult because people could not understand is he a</v>

121
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:53.914
<v Speaker 1>character?</v>

122
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Is he playing your part?</v>

123
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I had,</v>

124
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.670
<v Speaker 1>and I still have a lot of problems with the law because like I did a rape joke,</v>

125
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.240
<v Speaker 1>which I'm not proud of.</v>

126
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it's not something that,</v>

127
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.550
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

128
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.550
<v Speaker 1>well I'm so over the top.</v>

129
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I love it in the line.</v>

130
00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

131
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

132
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.131
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

133
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 1>does he,</v>

134
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.020
<v Speaker 1>does this guy wants people to be rated?</v>

135
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.581
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

136
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 1>what is he thinking?</v>

137
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:17.314
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

138
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 1>because with all those jokes was taken out of context and put it on newspapers</v>

139
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.320
<v Speaker 1>kind of killed,</v>

140
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

141
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.320
<v Speaker 1>he kind of killed the,</v>

142
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 1>my desire to the committee of her dad as well.</v>

143
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

144
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

145
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:27.611
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

146
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 1>it was difficult because he was like journalists,</v>

147
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.360
<v Speaker 1>journalists in the audience waiting for me to say some Shit,</v>

148
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.450
<v Speaker 1>put out of context and then guide like a fucking,</v>

149
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>like billions of clicks on their website because joke I did,</v>

150
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.821
<v Speaker 1>that's how we,</v>

151
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:48.010
<v Speaker 1>the controversy was starting over that.</v>

152
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if the same thing here.</v>

153
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>So they knew that this was a new thing.</v>

154
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

155
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.220
<v Speaker 1>and then so they would come to see it and then what would they criticizing it</v>

156
00:04:57.221 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 1>before this he was,</v>

00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Everybody loved it.</v>

159
00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Then of course,</v>

160
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 1>but when,</v>

161
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

162
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.831
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

163
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:03.730
<v Speaker 1>when man,</v>

164
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.850
<v Speaker 1>when we started to have money and a TV shows and we kind of ran away out of the</v>

165
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 1>underground,</v>

166
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I was doing shows at midnight,</v>

167
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 1>like packing at three,</v>

168
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.680
<v Speaker 1>300 seat theater.</v>

169
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 1>And midnight in Brazil.</v>

170
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>That was my thing.</v>

171
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Underground is some Powell in the middle of nowhere.</v>

172
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>But then people have this guy style into,</v>

173
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 1>let me give him a chance.</v>

174
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 1>So they put me on TV and I don't know where I was on TV doing the same thing.</v>

175
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.350

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying there's like a government censorship about what you can say,</v>

182
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>what you cannot say.</v>

183
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

263
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Language is difficult,</v>

264
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:53.270
<v Speaker 1>man to speak in English.</v>

265
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.351
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

266
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:54.531
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

267
00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:54.981
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>

268
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:55.814
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

269

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.300
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about it,</v>

271
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.223
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

272
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.370
<v Speaker 1>black people has to stop using the n word in rap songs because be,</v>

273
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a trap for immunity.</v>

274
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:05.594
<v Speaker 1>Karaoke.</v>

275
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I was singing karaoke and the end of the song,</v>

276
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 1>this guy came up to me,</v>

277
00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:10.964
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

278
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.070
<v Speaker 1>don't drop the n word man.</v>

279
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 1>But he was in the song,</v>

280
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:16.250
<v Speaker 1>so what should I do?</v>

281
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Not seem to more.</v>

282
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

283
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.550
<v Speaker 1>It's so that the light language is something that is,</v>

284
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm still like learning.</v>

285
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:23.294
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>

286
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult,</v>

287
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

288
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:24.831
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

289
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:25.670
<v Speaker 1>it's very tricky.</v>

290
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's obviously in America there's this sort of a acknowledgement that</v>

291
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.870
<v Speaker 2>black people were slaves for so long they are allowed to do more things and in</v>

292
00:08:37.571 --> 00:08:39.580
<v Speaker 2>particular how to use that word.</v>

293
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

294
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.970
<v Speaker 2>There's no other word like in terms of uh,</v>

295
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.833
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

296
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.610
<v Speaker 2>like a bad word about an ethnicity no.</v>

297
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.270
<v Speaker 2>That people use for them.</v>

298
00:08:49.271 --> 00:08:49.870
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

299
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.310
<v Speaker 2>like a Puerto Rican person would never call himself a spic and like a good,</v>

300
00:08:54.311 --> 00:08:55.144
<v Speaker 2>like what's up?</v>

301
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.660
<v Speaker 2>Like to another Puerto Rican,</v>

302
00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 2>it's v The n word is a very unique word.</v>

303
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no word really cannot say in any situation.</v>

304
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 2>I could say it if I'm explaining it like this guy called that guy a nigger.</v>

305
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.893
<v Speaker 2>I can say that.</v>

306
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 2>But even saying that people,</v>

307
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 2>some people wouldn't do that.</v>

308
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

309
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 2>I would never call someone that.</v>

310
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

311
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.430
<v Speaker 2>But I will use it if I,</v>

312
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:22.431
<v Speaker 2>if I'm quoting someone or if I'm explaining the word itself because to run away</v>

313
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:29.030
<v Speaker 2>from the joke is even hotter because he'll be our knowledging that that's up for</v>

314
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.093
<v Speaker 2>bidding war.</v>

315
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.193
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

316
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Chris Rock had one of the greatest bits of all time.</v>

317
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

318
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.470
<v Speaker 2>That there are black people and there are niggers.</v>

319
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 2>This was his joke,</v>

320
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.000
<v Speaker 2>but even for me to say that that was a joke,</v>

321
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:46.530
<v Speaker 2>and to say it that way is dangerous and it's one of the greatest comedy routines</v>

322
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 2>in the history of standup.</v>

323
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.541
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

324
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:48.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

325
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 2>But a white person could never quote that,</v>

326
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

327
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.040
<v Speaker 2>you can't do the joke.</v>

328
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Like if you tried to do it a joke to your friend,</v>

329
00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:56.180
<v Speaker 2>like you'd have to go can,</v>

330
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.013
<v Speaker 2>we can make it.</v>

331
00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be looking around.</v>

332
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.360
<v Speaker 2>Chris rock is so funny.</v>

333
00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you the bit like,</v>

334
00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:02.750
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be really careful.</v>

335
00:10:02.751 --> 00:10:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

336
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you could do the whole joke on a podcast.</v>

337
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.331
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

338
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:07.170
<v Speaker 2>you say the word,</v>

339
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.681
<v Speaker 2>the n word.</v>

340
00:10:07.681 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 2>Too many times people get mad at you.</v>

341
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.080
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy,</v>

342
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:10.914
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

343
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:11.791
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

344
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:13.080
<v Speaker 2>racism is crazy.</v>

345
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 2>The fact that there's still racism,</v>

346
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:15.990
<v Speaker 2>that's what's crazy.</v>

347
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.700
<v Speaker 2>The word is just sort of a like a,</v>

348
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 2>it's m,</v>

349
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.200
<v Speaker 2>it's symptomatic.</v>

350
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a,</v>

351
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.400
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing there that connects it to the feeling of racism,</v>

352
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.950
<v Speaker 2>even if you're not using it in a racist context.</v>

353
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.341
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

354
00:10:29.341 --> 00:10:30.300
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>

355
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:30.631
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

356
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:31.341
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

357
00:10:31.341 --> 00:10:32.011
<v Speaker 2>I'm a foreigner,</v>

358
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:32.780
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

359
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:33.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

360
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 2>I was never so aware of racists.</v>

361
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Like I am now living in this country.</v>

362
00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:38.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

363
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Brazil's,</v>

364
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:39.901
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

365
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 2>racism is very mild,</v>

366
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.260
<v Speaker 2>very different.</v>

367
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.670
<v Speaker 2>That is racism.</v>

368
00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:47.250
<v Speaker 2>I cannot say that there is not racism of our studies,</v>

369
00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:48.360
<v Speaker 2>but here it's like,</v>

370
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

371
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.090
<v Speaker 2>when there's an election they even say how the white folded and how the black</v>

372
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:54.924
<v Speaker 2>folded.</v>

373
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.780
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of weird because for me that's racism.</v>

374
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Yoda,</v>

375
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:03.240
<v Speaker 2>like dividing people more racist and it's clear on TV and sometimes they'll even</v>

376
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:04.710
<v Speaker 2>stop thinking about it.</v>

377
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.540
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's bought off the,</v>

378
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:06.711
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

379
00:11:06.711 --> 00:11:06.831
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

380
00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:07.620
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>

381
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:07.801
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

382
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:11.400
<v Speaker 2>it's because the black community doesn't feel like they're represented and they</v>

383
00:11:11.401 --> 00:11:15.150
<v Speaker 2>felt like they were represented finally when Obama became president because we</v>

384
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:15.481
<v Speaker 2>finally,</v>

385
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:16.440
<v Speaker 2>we had a black president.</v>

386
00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:17.280
<v Speaker 2>But other than that,</v>

387
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

388
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:19.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a real distinction.</v>

389
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Like with Obama,</v>

390
00:11:20.611 --> 00:11:22.260
<v Speaker 2>it was like almost universal.</v>

391
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:23.820
<v Speaker 2>He was going to get air quotes,</v>

392
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:24.810
<v Speaker 2>the black vote,</v>

393
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:25.561
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

394
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:26.460
<v Speaker 2>But with Trump,</v>

395
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

396
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.230
<v Speaker 2>or with anybody else,</v>

397
00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:29.580
<v Speaker 2>it's very tricky.</v>

398
00:11:29.581 --> 00:11:30.030
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

399
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.990
<v Speaker 2>it's a very different thing.</v>

400
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:34.800
<v Speaker 2>They want to make sure that their community is being represented and that their</v>

401
00:11:34.801 --> 00:11:35.970
<v Speaker 2>needs are being represented.</v>

402
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:40.170
<v Speaker 2>I completely understand and I agreed that there's someone knowledgement to make</v>

403
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.433
<v Speaker 2>the history,</v>

404
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.740
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time I'm knowledging uh,</v>

405
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 2>may divide kind of divides you a little bit as well.</v>

406
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

407
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:49.741
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

408
00:11:49.741 --> 00:11:52.790
<v Speaker 2>And it's also used as a weapon by some people that you know,</v>

409
00:11:52.791 --> 00:11:53.800
<v Speaker 2>or are not,</v>

410
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.540
<v Speaker 2>they're not being honest.</v>

411
00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.620
<v Speaker 2>They're just using it as a tool to divide people or to force their agenda</v>

412
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 2>through or,</v>

413
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

414
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:03.610
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

415
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.410
<v Speaker 2>the real problem is not the words.</v>

416
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is not,</v>

417
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 2>the real problem is actual real racism.</v>

418
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:09.970
<v Speaker 2>That's the real problem.</v>

419
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.230
<v Speaker 2>It still exists.</v>

420
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 2>It exists less than it did a hundred years ago and far less than it did 200</v>

421
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:15.810
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

422
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.490
<v Speaker 2>And a hundred years from now it'll probably be almost nonexistent.</v>

423
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:19.990
<v Speaker 2>But it's a real problem.</v>

424
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:20.890
<v Speaker 2>People are tribal.</v>

425
00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:22.600
<v Speaker 2>They differentiate by town.</v>

426
00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:25.830
<v Speaker 2>People differentiate by what part of the country you're from.</v>

427
00:12:25.831 --> 00:12:29.800
<v Speaker 2>And they certainly differentiate by nation and they differentiate by the origin</v>

428
00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:30.700
<v Speaker 2>of your ancestors.</v>

429
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.000
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

430
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.910
<v Speaker 2>it's really stupid is what it is.</v>

431
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're just celebrating the differences and how interesting.</v>

432
00:12:37.301 --> 00:12:37.571
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

433
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:41.170
<v Speaker 2>there's different food and different music and different culture and literature,</v>

434
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.520
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

435
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

436
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:43.841
<v Speaker 2>actual,</v>

437
00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 2>real racism.</v>

438
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:47.170
<v Speaker 2>The fact that it's still exists in 2000 and</v>

439
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.430
<v Speaker 1>it is crazy.</v>

440
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:48.761
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

441
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:49.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

442
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

443
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.610
<v Speaker 1>and that is the racism Brazil was,</v>

444
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that there's not racism,</v>

445
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.030
<v Speaker 1>more mild was there.</v>

446
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Interracial relationships are much more common.</v>

447
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.950
<v Speaker 1>If you see like a black,</v>

448
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.030
<v Speaker 1>a black guy with a white woman,</v>

449
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not a nobody that was going to say shit.</v>

450
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.361
<v Speaker 1>It's normal.</v>

451
00:13:04.361 --> 00:13:07.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that people will go by pointing or something.</v>

452
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

453
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.090
<v Speaker 1>But there's parts of this country where it's,</v>

454
00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem.</v>

455
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.340
<v Speaker 1>There's parts of this country where there's real racism on a black man with a</v>

456
00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:18.820
<v Speaker 1>white woman is in danger and now they have to be careful if they go into the</v>

457
00:13:18.821 --> 00:13:19.601
<v Speaker 1>wrong bar.</v>

458
00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:21.640
<v Speaker 1>They have to be careful if they're going to the wrong place.</v>

459
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.863
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>

460
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.530
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

461
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

462
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:24.670
<v Speaker 1>it is crazy.</v>

463
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.121
<v Speaker 1>That is a,</v>

464
00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:25.670
<v Speaker 1>some kind of,</v>

465
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:26.503
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

466
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

467
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

468
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 1>is not 100% of the time that I feel comfortable here.</v>

469
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of situations that I have,</v>

470
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 1>I feel that I can say the wrong thing because I don't want,</v>

471
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.770
<v Speaker 1>cause you don't understand the day.</v>

472
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Did you learn English?</v>

473
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.030

<v Speaker 1>let's try to do this over here.</v>

496
00:14:12.611 --> 00:14:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Where can we do it?</v>

497
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

498
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 1>W I had three friends that knew about it.</v>

499
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to fuck a cult.</v>

500
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.410
<v Speaker 1>A secret cult of people who knew about stand up.</v>

501
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.051
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

502
00:14:23.051 --> 00:14:23.231
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

503
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:23.681
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>

504
00:14:23.681 --> 00:14:24.580
<v Speaker 1>let's try it.</v>

505
00:14:24.581 --> 00:14:25.510
<v Speaker 1>But the only,</v>

506
00:14:25.511 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 1>the only email that we have was Seinfeld at the end of every episode.</v>

507
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:31.930
<v Speaker 1>That was the,</v>

508
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.130
<v Speaker 1>that was the thing for us.</v>

509
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:34.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the only reference.</v>

510
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I still remember that the first veto that were like talking about what we were</v>

511
00:14:38.201 --> 00:14:39.034
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

512
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:39.641
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>

513
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:39.821

514
00:14:39.821 --> 00:14:41.130
<v Speaker 1>so this is standup.</v>

515
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

516
00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:41.650
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

517
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:41.891
<v Speaker 1>we'll do,</v>

518
00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:42.260
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

519
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.860
<v Speaker 1>did you ever see every episode of Seinfeld at the end?</v>

520
00:14:44.861 --> 00:14:46.180
<v Speaker 1>He does like under routine.</v>

521
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:46.451
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

522
00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:48.280
<v Speaker 1>this is what they're going to do on the theater right now.</v>

523
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.920
<v Speaker 1>So that's when we wanted to do it.</v>

524
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.843
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

525
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 1>and it took some time because we started in 2002,</v>

526
00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:01.520
<v Speaker 1>2003 and youtube just came on 2005.</v>

527
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.770
<v Speaker 1>But when youtube came,</v>

528
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:08.771
<v Speaker 1>that was like a lot of people posting stand up and little like 30 minutes</v>

529
00:15:08.901 --> 00:15:09.231
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>

530
00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:10.400
<v Speaker 1>central specials.</v>

531
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.270
<v Speaker 1>And then we could see and that,</v>

532
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.210
<v Speaker 1>and he was difficult at first because of everything that I was writing,</v>

533
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.280
<v Speaker 1>I could see people doing on TV.</v>

534
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:20.450
<v Speaker 1>My jokes,</v>

535
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.490
<v Speaker 1>it was hard for me to explain to people,</v>

536
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.740
<v Speaker 1>this is my joke.</v>

537
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Like stole your jokes was not even like stealing because they didn't just joke.</v>

538
00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

539
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

540
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.580
<v Speaker 1>It was just a joke.</v>

541
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.840
<v Speaker 1>How can I explain to people,</v>

542
00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:33.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

543

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do jokes that other people wrote a this is it's mine.</v>

585
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:33.800
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting cause there's so many of them and no one knows anyone who wrote</v>

586
00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:34.540
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

587
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

588
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.960
<v Speaker 1>that was one guy in Brasilia was doing those three chokes and he created like</v>

589
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.720
<v Speaker 1>10% of what he interesting.</v>

590
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.800
<v Speaker 1>But for him was like,</v>

591
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:43.800
<v Speaker 1>this is what I created.</v>

592
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Denied the 90% that I didn't create.</v>

593
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.020
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of in the same chunk.</v>

594
00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:52.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't now when Seinfeld airs in Brazil,</v>

595
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.250
<v Speaker 1>I assume that it's translated to Portuguese is dubbed.</v>

596
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:56.143
<v Speaker 1>It's done.</v>

597
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.610
<v Speaker 1>And when it's dubbed as a dubbed,</v>

598
00:16:58.611 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 1>well does it make sense?</v>

599
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:01.403
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

600
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:01.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

601
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:02.151
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

602
00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:05.790
<v Speaker 1>He does the jokes translated standup wise now.</v>

603
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Now the series of works now,</v>

604
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.160
<v Speaker 1>now he got much better dubbing.</v>

605
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.063
<v Speaker 1>Got Much better.</v>

606
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

607
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.650
<v Speaker 1>But it's crazy.</v>

608
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.210
<v Speaker 1>We have subtitles as well.</v>

609
00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Like my Netflix special has subtitles here in America,</v>

610
00:17:18.561 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 1>so subtitles for English.</v>

611
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.991
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

612
00:17:20.991 --> 00:17:22.160
<v Speaker 1>So you do it in Portuguese.</v>

613
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Do you do much standup in English?</v>

614
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Having to send them here for her for eight months,</v>

615
00:17:27.471 --> 00:17:31.620
<v Speaker 1>like all the clubs and being three Improv and a factory in and a,</v>

616
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 1>but here I do it in English.</v>

617
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't even what I do on stage now it's something that I wrote leaving here</v>

618
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:42.230
<v Speaker 1>like 80% and 20% I translated for my acting Portuguese.</v>

619
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

620
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 1>And some of those jokes don't work when I translate.</v>

621
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's always a surprise.</v>

622
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:49.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

623
00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:50.341
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

624
00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:51.151
<v Speaker 1>Is a surprise.</v>

625
00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Is the culture so different,</v>

626
00:17:52.411 --> 00:17:52.790
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

627
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like what people think is funny and what they find ironic.</v>

628
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.660
<v Speaker 1>But Joe,</v>

629
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:57.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

630
00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.860
<v Speaker 1>a joke is a joke man.</v>

631
00:17:58.930 --> 00:17:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

632
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.750
<v Speaker 1>If he,</v>

633
00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.810
<v Speaker 1>if he has a tiny,</v>

634
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:01.151
<v Speaker 1>if he,</v>

635
00:18:01.151 --> 00:18:05.760
<v Speaker 1>if I now am able to do at the same pace that I do in Portuguese,</v>

636
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I feel comfortable doing in English.</v>

637
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:13.190
<v Speaker 1>So I feel the same thing and it's easier for me because I actually write jokes.</v>

638
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I have some friends that just like has some crowd work and interact with the</v>

639
00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Speaker 1>audience and there's a lot of physical comedy in it.</v>

640
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.500
<v Speaker 1>So to translate that to English is difficult.</v>

641
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

642
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.900
<v Speaker 1>I write jokes so if I translate it in a right way,</v>

643
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.160
<v Speaker 1>if he had,</v>

644
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.900
<v Speaker 1>if people understand the context,</v>

645
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:39.110
<v Speaker 1>if people understand that I'm talking about like the pregnancy off my wife and</v>

646
00:18:39.111 --> 00:18:44.111
<v Speaker 1>marriage and I dunno being single and everything or maybe that he can work now.</v>

647
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:45.961
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

648
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:48.840
<v Speaker 1>what was it like the first time you did stand up in America?</v>

649
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.130
<v Speaker 1>The first time in English,</v>

650
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.450
<v Speaker 1>I actually have a clip on Youtube that the laugh factory bolstered.</v>

651
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

652
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:55.350
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

653
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.090
<v Speaker 1>he was very surprising.</v>

654
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:02.420
<v Speaker 1>It was very surprising because some jokes that I didn't think was that funny</v>

655
00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:08.811
<v Speaker 1>worked and the ones that I was actually pretty sure that we work didn't work and</v>

656
00:19:10.611 --> 00:19:12.020
<v Speaker 1>now it's so frustrating.</v>

657
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Completely lost men.</v>

658
00:19:13.831 --> 00:19:14.664
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

659
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:19.530
<v Speaker 1>is this is going to be a huge role for me and I have been doing,</v>

660
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.520
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm,</v>

661
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.420
<v Speaker 1>this is why I'm here to stand up in English now.</v>

662
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 1>What now stand up since it's been,</v>

686
00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Only Portuguese.</v>

687
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

688
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.040
<v Speaker 1>There's no extent up in English in Brazil.</v>

689
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:14.860
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

690
00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.660
<v Speaker 1>Cause unfortunately that's not that many people that speaks English in Brazil.</v>

691
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:19.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

692
00:20:19.081 --> 00:20:22.920
<v Speaker 1>I know they were trying to organize shows like jade was trying to get people to</v>

693
00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:24.930
<v Speaker 1>come to Brazil to stand up and I was like,</v>

694
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.943
<v Speaker 1>good luck with that.</v>

695
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.430
<v Speaker 1>That just seems like there's,</v>

696
00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.080
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem like there's enough people.</v>

697
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Jade opened for me in Portuguese in Brazil and she helps me a little bit at the</v>

698
00:20:35.671 --> 00:20:36.504
<v Speaker 1>beginning here,</v>

699
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.060
<v Speaker 1>a opening San Clubs and then getting me some gigs.</v>

700
00:20:39.061 --> 00:20:39.990
<v Speaker 1>She's a very good friend.</v>

701
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.591
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

702
00:20:40.591 --> 00:20:41.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

703
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.380
<v Speaker 1>if for her it was a little difficult in Portuguese.</v>

704
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.041
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

705
00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:45.780
<v Speaker 1>to translate English to Portuguese</v>

706
00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.590
<v Speaker 1>forced because what you guys,</v>

707
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a coacher that there's a standup culture here.</v>

708
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.780
<v Speaker 1>If you're this freaky in a little crazy and he pee,</v>

709
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.260
<v Speaker 1>that's something that does not translate to another country.</v>

710
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.760
<v Speaker 1>You have to actually write jokes.</v>

711
00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

712
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

713
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.041
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

714
00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:07.670
<v Speaker 1>and for her it was a little difficult because she,</v>

715
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.400
<v Speaker 1>she has this way of doing it,</v>

716
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:14.730
<v Speaker 1>like interacting in that she's like any few mess up award in Portuguese.</v>

717
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.610
<v Speaker 1>It's in English.</v>

718
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:19.840
<v Speaker 1>If you mess up a word in English,</v>

719
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.950
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of funny.</v>

720
00:21:20.951 --> 00:21:21.131
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

721
00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:21.970
<v Speaker 1>he's a foreigner.</v>

722
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.201
<v Speaker 1>Except you.</v>

723
00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:24.580
<v Speaker 1>There's this likability.</v>

724
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.800
<v Speaker 1>But if I mess up or any Portuguese,</v>

725
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:27.970
<v Speaker 1>you're a prick.</v>

726
00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.930
<v Speaker 1>You don't speak Portuguese.</v>

727
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I speak English.</v>

728
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.540
<v Speaker 1>It sounds bad.</v>

729
00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:35.680
<v Speaker 1>And I see,</v>

730
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:35.951
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

731
00:21:35.951 --> 00:21:36.641
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

732
00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Because America is such a melting pot.</v>

733
00:21:38.231 --> 00:21:39.970
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different languages over here that someone,</v>

734
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:40.841
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

735
00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:41.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

736
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:42.340
<v Speaker 1>like I read something the other day,</v>

737
00:21:42.341 --> 00:21:44.710
<v Speaker 1>like if you see someone and they speak broken English,</v>

738
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:45.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

739
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.091
<v Speaker 1>don't make fun of them.</v>

740
00:21:46.091 --> 00:21:47.410
<v Speaker 1>That means they speak two languages.</v>

741
00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:48.244
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

742
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:49.060
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

743
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:49.820
<v Speaker 1>And you don't,</v>

744
00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.560
<v Speaker 1>of course most of us don't in Portuguese is similar to Spanish.</v>

745
00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:55.870
<v Speaker 1>So people who speaks Portuguese speak Spanish.</v>

746
00:21:55.871 --> 00:21:57.330
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of was between languages.</v>

747
00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.000
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

748
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.833
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

749
00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:59.500
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

750
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.100
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot.</v>

751
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Well that helped Fabrizio over doom in Mexico because he's so fluent in Spanish</v>

752
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:05.471
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

753
00:22:05.471 --> 00:22:05.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

754
00:22:05.681 --> 00:22:06.940
<v Speaker 1>when he was over there fighting,</v>

755
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

756
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.081
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

757
00:22:08.081 --> 00:22:08.711
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

758

759
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.490

<v Speaker 1>I lost a lot of lessons because of jokes.</v>

782
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

783
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.303

<v Speaker 1>so they really put me in trouble.</v>

800
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.680
<v Speaker 1>It was because of a singer.</v>

801
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:09.281
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

802
00:23:09.281 --> 00:23:13.030
<v Speaker 1>she was a singer and a kind of a almost kill my career.</v>

803
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:14.140
<v Speaker 1>You actually did.</v>

804
00:23:14.141 --> 00:23:14.891
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm here.</v>

805
00:23:14.891 --> 00:23:16.640
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

806
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

807
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:18.341
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

808
00:23:18.341 --> 00:23:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I got into a huge lawsuit and it looks dumb when you explain,</v>

809
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:22.811
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

810
00:23:22.811 --> 00:23:23.680
<v Speaker 1>it's just a singer.</v>

811
00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.740
<v Speaker 1>But he became all this talk about freedom of speech and what comedians can say</v>

812
00:23:29.981 --> 00:23:31.600
<v Speaker 1>and what they cannot say.</v>

813
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Are you allowed to fewer fandom.</v>

814
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.800
<v Speaker 1>And now there's like law schools talks about this,</v>

815
00:23:38.801 --> 00:23:40.300
<v Speaker 1>the lawsuit that I had,</v>

816
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.760
<v Speaker 1>law school discussions,</v>

817
00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.030
<v Speaker 1>discussions because of,</v>

821
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:48.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

822
00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:49.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

823
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:50.300
<v Speaker 1>he's not because of the losses.</v>

824
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I want to be sued by the good ones because I don't want to be known by a bad</v>

825
00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:56.421
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

826
00:23:56.421 --> 00:23:56.661
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

827
00:23:56.661 --> 00:23:56.830
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

828
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:57.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

829
00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:57.621
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

830
00:23:57.621 --> 00:23:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

831
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.140
<v Speaker 1>It's just like I was saying this and he's just like,</v>

832
00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:00.790
<v Speaker 1>you were meeting,</v>

833
00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:01.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

834
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Eddy Miller.</v>

835
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.940
<v Speaker 1>If you one of the greatest comedians ever,</v>

836
00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:04.371
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>

837
00:24:04.371 --> 00:24:04.910
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

838
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.200
<v Speaker 1>there's doctor Doolittle.</v>

839
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.640
<v Speaker 1>You don't have that right now.</v>

840
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:08.720
<v Speaker 1>This is the same thing with me.</v>

841
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.400
<v Speaker 1>That joke was a shitty joke.</v>

842
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:15.430
<v Speaker 1>And she was like bragging on TV and she was like doing a story on TV.</v>

843
00:24:16.851 --> 00:24:19.400
<v Speaker 1>And I was the host of this huge TV show,</v>

844
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.050
<v Speaker 1>like the daily show,</v>

845
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 1>the daily show meeting,</v>

846
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:24.170
<v Speaker 1>the view.</v>

847
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.070
<v Speaker 1>It was something like that.</v>

848
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:26.330
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

849
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:27.840
<v Speaker 1>and in the middle of the thing,</v>

850
00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:29.470
<v Speaker 1>she was shows there and my friend asked me,</v>

851
00:24:29.471 --> 00:24:29.661
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

852
00:24:29.661 --> 00:24:32.390
<v Speaker 1>she's pregnant and do you think she's still hot?</v>

853
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:32.901
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

854
00:24:32.901 --> 00:24:37.901
<v Speaker 1>she so hot that I would fuck her in her baby and a shitty joke,</v>

855
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:39.620
<v Speaker 1>but that was live.</v>

856
00:24:39.621 --> 00:24:40.880
<v Speaker 1>It was like right on time.</v>

857
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Everybody laughed and there was no problem.</v>

858
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.000
<v Speaker 1>But next week it was this huge thing because she was like,</v>

859
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.140
<v Speaker 1>her husband was very influential show and uh,</v>

860
00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.140
<v Speaker 1>her husband was managing run now do,</v>

861
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:58.280
<v Speaker 1>which was one of the biggest soccer player ever.</v>

862
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.110
<v Speaker 1>So there was this whole thing,</v>

863
00:25:00.111 --> 00:25:05.111
<v Speaker 1>the TV show lost sponsors and they want to suspend me from the TV show because</v>

864
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.460
<v Speaker 1>the of a joke that I did,</v>

865
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.020
<v Speaker 1>she didn't tell them.</v>

866
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.470
<v Speaker 1>They didn't tell me to apologize at first,</v>

867
00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:13.520
<v Speaker 1>but he suspended me.</v>

868
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:14.990
<v Speaker 1>So I quit the show.</v>

869
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:16.581
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know.</v>

870
00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:17.810
<v Speaker 1>So you just apologize.</v>

871
00:25:17.811 --> 00:25:22.811
<v Speaker 1>And I decided not to apologize because I felt that after like 10 years,</v>

872
00:25:23.151 --> 00:25:25.010
<v Speaker 1>don't stand there or 12 years doing stand up.</v>

873
00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:28.940
<v Speaker 1>It was important for me to like put my feet on the ground and say,</v>

874
00:25:28.941 --> 00:25:29.774
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

875
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.090
<v Speaker 1>if we step back right now,</v>

876
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:33.290
<v Speaker 1>what am I,</v>

877
00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:36.590
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do in like a two years?</v>

878
00:25:36.591 --> 00:25:40.220
<v Speaker 1>This is important for all of us is important for comedy.</v>

879
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:44.030
<v Speaker 1>So I lost lasel to loss movies a lot.</v>

880
00:25:44.031 --> 00:25:44.960
<v Speaker 1>So what did they,</v>

881
00:25:44.961 --> 00:25:46.890
<v Speaker 1>what did they rule in the lawsuit?</v>

882
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Like what was the ruling?</v>

883
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.990
<v Speaker 1>I have friend that her honor.</v>

884
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Honor's,</v>

885
00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:50.641
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

886
00:25:50.641 --> 00:25:51.540
<v Speaker 1>it was something like that.</v>

887
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:52.380
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

888
00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.213
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

889
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.313
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

890
00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:55.370
<v Speaker 1>people can sue you.</v>

891
00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.490
<v Speaker 1>The suing is part of the democracy.</v>

892
00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.690
<v Speaker 1>It's okay to sue you,</v>

893
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.720
<v Speaker 1>but to lot lose a lawsuit is that's the problem.</v>

894
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I lost like $150,000 or the sheet but in Brazil was 350,000 high.</v>

895
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.730
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a lawyer and you get $10,000 a month,</v>

896
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.280
<v Speaker 1>you get 10,000 leads a month.</v>

897
00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:15.651
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

898
00:26:15.651 --> 00:26:16.790
<v Speaker 1>you don't translate money.</v>

899
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
<v Speaker 1>So I lost a lot of money but the thing has gotten me a huge headache and uh,</v>

900
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.761
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

901
00:26:22.761 --> 00:26:23.040
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

902
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:23.873
<v Speaker 1>he was bad.</v>

903
00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.450
<v Speaker 1>He was bad just from that one just for that one.</v>

904
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.710
<v Speaker 1>But you saw other lawsuits because of digital,</v>

905
00:26:30.711 --> 00:26:32.420
<v Speaker 1>like a rape joke and uh,</v>

906
00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I got like this women movement,</v>

907
00:26:35.571 --> 00:26:36.680
<v Speaker 1>like trying to break,</v>

908
00:26:36.681 --> 00:26:38.630
<v Speaker 1>break into my bar and break my,</v>

909
00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.120
<v Speaker 1>the door of my comedy club and there was like,</v>

910
00:26:41.121 --> 00:26:42.060
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>

911
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 1>but the discussion</v>

912
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.470
<v Speaker 2>was more important than the problem itself.</v>

913
00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:51.471
<v Speaker 2>I kind of find it was the discussion about freedom of speech in that was,</v>

914
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.650
<v Speaker 2>that was huge.</v>

915
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.930
<v Speaker 2>What is freedom of speech like in Brazil?</v>

916
00:26:54.931 --> 00:26:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Is it the same brick?</v>

917
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously we have the first amendment.</v>

918
00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:58.523
<v Speaker 2>You have the first.</v>

919
00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Do you have something that we don't,</v>

920
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.200
<v Speaker 2>we don't have that.</v>

921
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:01.411
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

922
00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:02.460
<v Speaker 2>they don't have that in Canada.</v>

923
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.270
<v Speaker 2>We don't have that.</v>

924
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.040
<v Speaker 2>I had Mike Ward on in Canada.</v>

925
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:05.903
<v Speaker 2>Do you know his story?</v>

926
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 2>I know he's the guy who,</v>

927
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.660
<v Speaker 2>he made a joke about a sick boy.</v>

928
00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.350
<v Speaker 2>The boy was still alive years later.</v>

929
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.111
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was.</v>

930
00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:17.130
<v Speaker 2>And you know it was just a bad joke about this guy still being alive and can he</v>

931
00:27:17.131 --> 00:27:17.964
<v Speaker 2>get his money back?</v>

932
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:18.780
<v Speaker 2>Cause like,</v>

933
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:19.740
<v Speaker 2>cause they donated money.</v>

934
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.410
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

935
00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:24.510
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up joke but it's supposed to be a fucked up joke and he's doing it</v>

936
00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:27.210
<v Speaker 2>in a nightclub situation where people are drinking,</v>

937
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.330
<v Speaker 2>you say things that are inappropriate and that's the art form.</v>

938
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.990
<v Speaker 2>He got sued and he's still in the process of it right now.</v>

939
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:37.560
<v Speaker 2>And there's another case in Vancouver where these women were heckling,</v>

940
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:42.030
<v Speaker 2>they were yelling things out during the show and then the comedian went on stage</v>

941
00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:45.990
<v Speaker 2>and be rated the women and the women's sued and won because a,</v>

942
00:27:45.991 --> 00:27:49.740
<v Speaker 2>they were lesbians and he made some lesbian jokes about them at their own</v>

943
00:27:49.741 --> 00:27:50.191
<v Speaker 2>expense.</v>

944
00:27:50.191 --> 00:27:53.910
<v Speaker 2>And so then they took him to court and they won and they won what?</v>

945
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.850
<v Speaker 2>They want some judgment where he had to pay them.</v>

946
00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:58.270
<v Speaker 2>I want to change me.</v>

947
00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:58.921
<v Speaker 2>How much was it?</v>

948
00:27:58.921 --> 00:28:01.650
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $30,000.</v>

949
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.233
<v Speaker 2>$30,000.</v>

950
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.250
<v Speaker 2>And for this gentleman,</v>

951
00:28:05.251 --> 00:28:06.180
<v Speaker 2>this comedian,</v>

952
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:06.451
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

953
00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:07.560
<v Speaker 2>I think that was a lot of money.</v>

954
00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:08.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

955
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.200
<v Speaker 2>40 to $42,000.</v>

956
00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:10.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

957
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of fucking money for an opening comedian.</v>

958
00:28:13.501 --> 00:28:13.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

959
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.360
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't a famous guy.</v>

960
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:15.991
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

961
00:28:15.991 --> 00:28:18.480
<v Speaker 2>that might be two years worth for him.</v>

962
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:18.931
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

963
00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:19.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

964
00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:19.450
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

965
00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.040
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

966
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:20.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

967
00:28:20.341 --> 00:28:21.080
<v Speaker 2>I lost a lot of money.</v>

968
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:21.780
<v Speaker 2>So Canada,</v>

969
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.650
<v Speaker 2>similar count.</v>

970
00:28:22.651 --> 00:28:25.980
<v Speaker 2>Canada does not have freedom of speech the same way the United States does.</v>

971
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

972
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.150
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

973
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:28.320
<v Speaker 2>that's why,</v>

974
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

975
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:33.360
<v Speaker 2>I feel what I do comedy here and I feel that people get uncomfortable about a</v>

976
00:28:33.361 --> 00:28:34.194
<v Speaker 2>joke or two.</v>

977
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.580
<v Speaker 2>That's when I get stressed.</v>

978
00:28:35.581 --> 00:28:38.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have the fee that of saying those things.</v>

979
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

980
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.000
<v Speaker 2>I have this joke that I say it's about the n word as well.</v>

981
00:28:42.001 --> 00:28:44.010
<v Speaker 2>I might have said maybe I have to change my,</v>

982
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.110
<v Speaker 2>but I have this job that I do is like when I arrived here,</v>

983
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:49.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

984
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.400
<v Speaker 2>someone said to me,</v>

985
00:28:50.401 --> 00:28:50.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

986
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.890
<v Speaker 2>don't use the n word or people are going to kick her ass.</v>

987
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.050
<v Speaker 2>But they never told me what the n word was.</v>

988
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:57.570
<v Speaker 2>So for the past six months,</v>

989
00:28:57.571 --> 00:29:02.571
<v Speaker 2>I have been avoiding all wars with the letter n and the other big guy came up to</v>

990
00:29:02.761 --> 00:29:03.111
<v Speaker 2>me and said,</v>

991
00:29:03.111 --> 00:29:03.990
<v Speaker 2>can I fuck your ass?</v>

992
00:29:03.991 --> 00:29:04.824
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

993
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.833
<v Speaker 2>maybe</v>

994
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:12.030
<v Speaker 2>when I say this jug is like I have to set up,</v>

995
00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:16.800
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy because when I first did it was like a fucking thing.</v>

996
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Everybody got an uncomfortable.</v>

997
00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:19.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

998
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:23.730
<v Speaker 2>But now I sat up as a misunderstanding because I'm a foreigner.</v>

999
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>

1000
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm free to do everything.</v>

1001
00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1002
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.083
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1003
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:27.923
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of,</v>

1004
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I found a way of doing it.</v>

1005
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:32.460
<v Speaker 2>He found a way in.</v>

1006
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1007
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:33.983
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1008
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.400
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

1009
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:38.550
<v Speaker 2>And I watched you a lot and I see a lot of people here.</v>

1010
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.721
<v Speaker 2>I saw the other guy,</v>

1011
00:29:39.721 --> 00:29:40.554
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

1012
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:45.620
<v Speaker 2>this guy did an interview with you and he did this show in a college and uh,</v>

1013
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.720
<v Speaker 2>he did a joke and people took him out of State Nimesh Patel.</v>

1014
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1015
00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1016
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.641
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1017
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Because you built the freedom to do that.</v>

1018
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1019
00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.520
<v Speaker 2>And now you're discussing if you can,</v>

1020
00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.070
<v Speaker 2>or youthful cannot solely in colleges though,</v>

1021
00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:02.680
<v Speaker 2>when children today,</v>

1022
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.030
<v Speaker 2>and I want to call them children,</v>

1023
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 2>they do not understand the danger in suppressing free speech.</v>

1024
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:14.980
<v Speaker 2>And so they think that what they're doing is by suppressing free speech and</v>

1025
00:30:14.981 --> 00:30:16.780
<v Speaker 2>changing the way people communicate.</v>

1026
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.720
<v Speaker 2>What they're doing is making the world a better place.</v>

1027
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:20.331
<v Speaker 2>They think they're,</v>

1028
00:30:20.331 --> 00:30:23.290
<v Speaker 2>they're signaling the virtue and making the world a better place at the same</v>

1029
00:30:23.291 --> 00:30:23.920
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1030
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.830
<v Speaker 2>But it's just ignorant.</v>

1031
00:30:24.831 --> 00:30:26.500
<v Speaker 2>So just don't understand that you can't,</v>

1032
00:30:26.501 --> 00:30:26.681
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1033
00:30:26.681 --> 00:30:27.700
<v Speaker 2>you can't necessarily,</v>

1034
00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.380
<v Speaker 2>you can't control people.</v>

1035
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:33.490
<v Speaker 2>And to think that by just getting upset and silencing someone,</v>

1036
00:30:33.491 --> 00:30:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm removing them from the stage at that ends the conversation.</v>

1037
00:30:36.191 --> 00:30:36.820
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

1038
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.380
<v Speaker 2>it reinforces their position.</v>

1039
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:39.101
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

1040
00:30:39.101 --> 00:30:39.401
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1041
00:30:39.401 --> 00:30:39.641
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1042
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I was right about you fucking snowflakes and you little babies like you,</v>

1043
00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:46.720
<v Speaker 2>you can't even understand why when things are uncomfortable that it doesn't</v>

1044
00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:48.070
<v Speaker 2>necessarily mean it's negative.</v>

1045
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:52.390
<v Speaker 2>And that like you're like try to put yourself in someone's position and see what</v>

1046
00:30:52.391 --> 00:30:52.900
<v Speaker 2>he's saying.</v>

1047
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:53.860
<v Speaker 2>And in the Meshes Kit,</v>

1048
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:54.743
<v Speaker 2>this case,</v>

1049
00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:56.080
<v Speaker 2>it's actually kinda funny,</v>

1050
00:30:56.081 --> 00:30:56.471
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1051
00:30:56.471 --> 00:30:58.840
<v Speaker 2>he's very open minded guy,</v>

1052
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.010
<v Speaker 2>very progressive.</v>

1053
00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:00.341
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1054
00:31:00.341 --> 00:31:02.920
<v Speaker 2>he's not in any way a racist.</v>

1055
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:07.950
<v Speaker 2>And his joke was that people say that being gay is a choice.</v>

1056
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:09.161
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1057
00:31:09.161 --> 00:31:12.130
<v Speaker 2>I know it's not a choice because I have a friend who's black and gay.</v>

1058
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.410
<v Speaker 2>There's no way he would choose both of those things.</v>

1059
00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.370
<v Speaker 2>And it was just double up this just him being funny.</v>

1060
00:31:18.371 --> 00:31:19.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny joke and they,</v>

1061
00:31:19.951 --> 00:31:21.040
<v Speaker 2>they will like cut,</v>

1062
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.020
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck off the stage.</v>

1063
00:31:23.021 --> 00:31:23.801
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

1064
00:31:23.801 --> 00:31:24.251
<v Speaker 2>Come on man.</v>

1065
00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:25.240
<v Speaker 2>You don't think that's funny.</v>

1066
00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.620
<v Speaker 2>And it's also coming from an Indian man who I'm sure is experienced racism.</v>

1067
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:30.371
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1068
00:31:30.371 --> 00:31:35.371
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing is it's very fascinating to see young kids who are growing up in</v>

1069
00:31:35.891 --> 00:31:38.140
<v Speaker 2>this PC culture bubble and you don't,</v>

1070
00:31:38.141 --> 00:31:40.900
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes people say on this podcast that we talk about it too much.</v>

1071
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:41.441
<v Speaker 2>It may be there.</v>

1072
00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:42.274
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1073
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Maybe sometimes it's annoying if you're listening to your cubicle and you hear</v>

1074
00:31:45.161 --> 00:31:46.420
<v Speaker 2>me talking too much about this,</v>

1075
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:51.870
<v Speaker 2>but it's because it's an issue that's very dear to my heart cause I understand</v>

1076
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:57.430
<v Speaker 2>the dangers of not being able to communicate freely and I also and understand</v>

1077
00:31:57.431 --> 00:32:00.640
<v Speaker 2>what happens when if you suppress free communication,</v>

1078
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:02.020
<v Speaker 2>the people that you're suppressing,</v>

1079
00:32:02.021 --> 00:32:06.610
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get more and more angry and radical and it just makes their</v>

1080
00:32:06.611 --> 00:32:11.611
<v Speaker 2>position that they feel more justified in there in perhaps even people who are</v>

1081
00:32:12.251 --> 00:32:16.840
<v Speaker 2>racists could perhaps be more racist or people who are angry about gay people</v>

1082
00:32:16.841 --> 00:32:20.050
<v Speaker 2>will become more angry about it if you suppress their ability to express</v>

1083
00:32:20.051 --> 00:32:20.440
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

1084
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.440
<v Speaker 2>That's when borns those little movements and neo Nazi movements,</v>

1085
00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:25.570
<v Speaker 2>a little groups and then little blips on the web,</v>

1086
00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.100
<v Speaker 2>the deep web when discussion.</v>

1087
00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.240
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you in,</v>

1088
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.900
<v Speaker 2>when it's for beating I think is you kind of forgive them the power that they</v>

1089
00:32:31.901 --> 00:32:32.734
<v Speaker 2>didn't have.</v>

1090
00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:33.431
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1091
00:32:33.431 --> 00:32:36.550
<v Speaker 2>And I think this is something that we were really just getting to understand.</v>

1092
00:32:36.551 --> 00:32:37.090
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1093
00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:37.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1094
00:32:37.331 --> 00:32:37.631
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

1095
00:32:37.631 --> 00:32:41.480
<v Speaker 2>I've had a few conversations about this recently with the head of Twitter and</v>

1096
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:42.321
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>

1097
00:32:42.321 --> 00:32:44.330
<v Speaker 2>an independent journalist Tim pool last week.</v>

1098
00:32:44.331 --> 00:32:47.420
<v Speaker 2>And I think what people were just starting to kind of understand,</v>

1099
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:48.770
<v Speaker 2>even though everyone's uncomfortable about this,</v>

1100
00:32:48.771 --> 00:32:51.650
<v Speaker 2>is we're still trying to figure this out.</v>

1101
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Social media is only 10 plus years old.</v>

1102
00:32:54.741 --> 00:32:58.100
<v Speaker 2>This is an incredibly new experience for us and I don't think everybody knows</v>

1103
00:32:58.101 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 2>exactly how to proceed.</v>

1104
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.930
<v Speaker 2>And this idea that you could just band people and they just banned people for</v>

1105
00:33:02.931 --> 00:33:03.291
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1106
00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:05.060
<v Speaker 2>If they say something that makes people uncomfortable,</v>

1107
00:33:05.061 --> 00:33:06.740
<v Speaker 2>if they say an opinion you don't agree with,</v>

1108
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:07.850
<v Speaker 2>banned them for life.</v>

1109
00:33:07.851 --> 00:33:09.890
<v Speaker 2>And we're saying we're experiencing that right now.</v>

1110
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.700
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1111
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1112
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.210
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to figure out what to do and how to,</v>

1113
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.810
<v Speaker 2>how to fix this and how to mitigate it without endorsing people,</v>

1114
00:33:17.811 --> 00:33:19.880
<v Speaker 2>harassing people and divorcing people.</v>

1115
00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1116
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1117
00:33:20.721 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 2>threatening people and giving out their address and their phone number and</v>

1118
00:33:23.451 --> 00:33:24.284
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>

1119
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.041
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1120
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:26.540
<v Speaker 2>it's a process that we're,</v>

1121
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:27.650
<v Speaker 2>we're all going through right now.</v>

1122
00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.730
<v Speaker 2>It is a learning process for the,</v>

1123
00:33:29.731 --> 00:33:30.071
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1124
00:33:30.071 --> 00:33:30.840
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1125
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.551
<v Speaker 2>the whole country.</v>

1126
00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:36.551
<v Speaker 2>But the thing that a noise annoys me a little bit is that I,</v>

1127
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:42.520
<v Speaker 2>I leave it in another country and I see how things are difficult and how much</v>

1128
00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:46.070
<v Speaker 2>time I spent explaining to people what I was doing.</v>

1129
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.301
<v Speaker 2>And for you guys,</v>

1130
00:33:47.301 --> 00:33:51.260
<v Speaker 2>it's like I was having the same problems that Lenny Bruce was having like a long</v>

1131
00:33:51.261 --> 00:33:52.050
<v Speaker 2>time ago.</v>

1132
00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:52.883
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1133
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.540
<v Speaker 2>You guys built that to have that discussion.</v>

1134
00:33:56.541 --> 00:33:57.374
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1135
00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:00.860
<v Speaker 2>it is important because that's the way the ward uh,</v>

1136
00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:01.843
<v Speaker 2>evolved.</v>

1137
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:03.110
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>

1138
00:34:03.111 --> 00:34:04.490
<v Speaker 2>he fuels old.</v>

1139
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.920
<v Speaker 2>It feels old because you understand the history of it.</v>

1140
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.520
<v Speaker 2>In America it feels old because a,</v>

1141
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:12.110
<v Speaker 2>you already have that discussion a long time ago.</v>

1142
00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:12.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1143
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.790
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't keep having this conversation when you think that you'll finally,</v>

1144
00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:19.190
<v Speaker 2>if you free to say whatever you want now,</v>

1145
00:34:19.191 --> 00:34:20.960
<v Speaker 2>there's people trying to hold you back.</v>

1146
00:34:20.961 --> 00:34:21.800
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1147
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:22.401
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1148
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:24.800
<v Speaker 2>it's not really effective.</v>

1149
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:25.431
<v Speaker 2>See there's,</v>

1150
00:34:25.431 --> 00:34:26.780
<v Speaker 2>there's people that are angry about it.</v>

1151
00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:26.961
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1152
00:34:26.961 --> 00:34:29.330
<v Speaker 2>there is on social media,</v>

1153
00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.300
<v Speaker 2>there's certainly people that are being effective with it,</v>

1154
00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:34.170
<v Speaker 2>but in standup comedy it's,</v>

1155
00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.820
<v Speaker 2>there's blow back and push back.</v>

1156
00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:39.710
<v Speaker 2>But it's not very effective.</v>

1157
00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Like for the top guys,</v>

1158
00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:44.120
<v Speaker 2>for guys like Dave Chappelle and Bill Burr,</v>

1159
00:34:44.121 --> 00:34:44.331
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1160
00:34:44.331 --> 00:34:48.200
<v Speaker 2>it actually makes their standup better because people are so tired of all this</v>

1161
00:34:48.201 --> 00:34:48.830
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1162
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:50.630
<v Speaker 2>They're so tired of PC culture.</v>

1163
00:34:50.631 --> 00:34:54.740
<v Speaker 2>They're so tired of being told what they should and shouldn't think is funny and</v>

1164
00:34:54.741 --> 00:34:56.720
<v Speaker 2>what is acceptable and not acceptable.</v>

1165
00:34:56.721 --> 00:34:57.531
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1166
00:34:57.531 --> 00:34:57.920
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1167
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.170
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of weird shit going on right now.</v>

1168
00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.670
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever have problem with that?</v>

1169
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.591
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1170
00:35:02.591 --> 00:35:04.830
<v Speaker 2>Did someone ever leave your show because of a joke?</v>

1171
00:35:04.831 --> 00:35:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Who did it?</v>

1172
00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck,</v>

1173
00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:06.960
<v Speaker 2>what was the subject?</v>

1174
00:35:06.961 --> 00:35:07.151
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1175
00:35:07.151 --> 00:35:07.431
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1176
00:35:07.431 --> 00:35:09.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember him so many times.</v>

1177
00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.780
<v Speaker 2>It's happened so many times.</v>

1178
00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1179
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean people just get angry.</v>

1180
00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.890
<v Speaker 2>They get angry and you're allowed to,</v>

1181
00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:17.060
<v Speaker 2>you mean it's fun?</v>

1182
00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:18.770
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1183
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:19.520
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1184
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.380
<v Speaker 2>everybody has their own sensibilities and the problem,</v>

1185
00:35:21.381 --> 00:35:25.820
<v Speaker 2>one of the problems with standup comedy is if you go to a club to see music,</v>

1186
00:35:25.821 --> 00:35:27.890
<v Speaker 2>you know what kind of music going to go see?</v>

1187
00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:29.000
<v Speaker 2>You want to go see salsa,</v>

1188
00:35:29.001 --> 00:35:30.020
<v Speaker 2>they have a salsa club,</v>

1189
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.370
<v Speaker 2>you want to go see jazz,</v>

1190
00:35:31.371 --> 00:35:34.100
<v Speaker 2>you want to go see rock and roll or you want to go to a rap show.</v>

1191
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.210
<v Speaker 2>You know what you're,</v>

1192
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.320
<v Speaker 2>you're going to see.</v>

1193
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:37.890
<v Speaker 2>But if you go to see comedy,</v>

1194
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:43.160
<v Speaker 2>you could see fucking Barry Manilow followed by guns and roses fall by run DMC.</v>

1195
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1196
00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:44.820
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1197
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.653
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1198
00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.960
<v Speaker 2>unless you're going to see a specific comedian,</v>

1199
00:35:48.961 --> 00:35:50.820
<v Speaker 2>like you're going to see Jim Gaffigan,</v>

1200
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.730
<v Speaker 2>you don't necessarily know what the fuck you're going to see.</v>

1201
00:35:53.731 --> 00:35:56.670
<v Speaker 2>You go to the comedy store on sunset,</v>

1202
00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:01.080
<v Speaker 2>you're going to see if you get there at nine o'clock and stay til two o'clock in</v>

1203
00:36:01.081 --> 00:36:01.251
<v Speaker 2>the Morn,</v>

1204
00:36:01.251 --> 00:36:03.990
<v Speaker 2>you're going to see 10 15 different fucking comedians.</v>

1205
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:05.790
<v Speaker 2>And they're all different.</v>

1206
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:06.541
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1207
00:36:06.541 --> 00:36:07.530
<v Speaker 2>some of them are men,</v>

1208
00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 2>some of them are women and some of them are gay and some of them were black.</v>

1209
00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:13.410
<v Speaker 2>And they all have different points of view and some of them you're going to</v>

1210
00:36:13.411 --> 00:36:14.850
<v Speaker 2>think of the best and some of them you think,</v>

1211
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.121
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1212
00:36:15.121 --> 00:36:16.200
<v Speaker 2>when is this guy getting offstage?</v>

1213
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:17.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just,</v>

1214
00:36:17.371 --> 00:36:18.204
<v Speaker 2>that's just part of it.</v>

1215
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:19.163
<v Speaker 2>But for us,</v>

1216
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:22.770
<v Speaker 2>what's really important about that is that when I worked there,</v>

1217
00:36:22.771 --> 00:36:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1218
00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I know that it's not my crowd.</v>

1219
00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.720
<v Speaker 2>There are everyone's crowd.</v>

1220
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.991
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1221
00:36:27.991 --> 00:36:29.070
<v Speaker 2>if I go to do a show,</v>

1222
00:36:29.071 --> 00:36:31.740
<v Speaker 2>if I do a show somewhere and San Diego say,</v>

1223
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:32.940
<v Speaker 2>and I advertise it,</v>

1224
00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:33.601
<v Speaker 2>the people that come,</v>

00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:36.720
<v Speaker 2>but if I go to the comedy store,</v>

1228
00:36:36.721 --> 00:36:39.810
<v Speaker 2>they might be there to see Neil Brennan or Chris Delea or whoever</v>

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:35.730
<v Speaker 1>They have a neck and mouth doctor and the a dentist,</v>

1299
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.440
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the one who does both.</v>

1300
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:40.320
<v Speaker 1>This is the doctor that,</v>

1301
00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:41.950
<v Speaker 1>that time or at that place.</v>

1302
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.380
<v Speaker 1>So the surgery went wrong.</v>

1303
00:38:44.381 --> 00:38:47.440
<v Speaker 1>I had to go back to Brazil and I had to do the surgery again.</v>

1304
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

1305
00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:48.821
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1306
00:38:48.821 --> 00:38:50.200
<v Speaker 1>and I decided not to come back.</v>

1307
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 1>So this is how,</v>

1308
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.000
<v Speaker 1>this is why this moment for me is very important.</v>

1309
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:56.081
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1310
00:38:56.081 --> 00:38:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I never thought that I had,</v>

1311
00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:58.780
<v Speaker 1>my dream was to play basketball.</v>

1312
00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:00.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was dedicating my life,</v>

1313
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:01.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1314
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:02.290
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

1315
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:03.070
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1316
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:06.400
<v Speaker 1>I never thought that I will have a second chance in America.</v>

1317
00:39:06.401 --> 00:39:07.250
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

1318
00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.500
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1319
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

1320
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.940
<v Speaker 1>my second chance,</v>

1321
00:39:09.941 --> 00:39:11.110
<v Speaker 1>and I can mess this up.</v>

1322
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:16.120
<v Speaker 1>So what made you come from Brazil to America for standup comedy?</v>

1323
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.350
<v Speaker 1>It was all the lawsuits.</v>

1324
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:18.940
<v Speaker 1>He was a little bit of the lawsuits.</v>

1325
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that it was not,</v>

1326
00:39:20.381 --> 00:39:21.190
<v Speaker 1>but my friend,</v>

1327
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:24.700
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you want to play basketball,</v>

1328
00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:26.110
<v Speaker 1>do you want to play in the NBA?</v>

1329
00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1330
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.600
<v Speaker 1>If you want to play soccer,</v>

1331
00:39:28.601 --> 00:39:30.070
<v Speaker 1>you want to go to Barcelona.</v>

1332
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1333
00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.200
<v Speaker 1>standups is here,</v>

1334
00:39:32.201 --> 00:39:32.501
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1335
00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:34.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the place that you get a B.</v>

1336
00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:38.800
<v Speaker 1>And we never had a Brazilian standup comedian in,</v>

1337
00:39:38.801 --> 00:39:39.270
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1338
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:40.103
<v Speaker 1>in here,</v>

1339
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:42.730
<v Speaker 1>just like jade are the ones who were born here,</v>

1340
00:39:42.731 --> 00:39:46.870
<v Speaker 1>but not the ones who actually was like doing standup in Brazil and coming here.</v>

1341
00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:48.130
<v Speaker 1>I think it was important for me,</v>

1342
00:39:48.131 --> 00:39:49.540
<v Speaker 1>for all my colleagues and all my,</v>

1343
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:53.290
<v Speaker 1>all the comedians in Brazil as well to start something here.</v>

1344
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:55.930
<v Speaker 1>He has been a very good experience.</v>

1345
00:39:55.931 --> 00:39:56.764
<v Speaker 1>A little hard.</v>

1346
00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1347
00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:59.290
<v Speaker 1>But it has been a lot of,</v>

1348
00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fun as well.</v>

1349
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Now are you working over here?</v>

1350
00:40:01.601 --> 00:40:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Did you save up money and you live it off your money for you still have my</v>

1351
00:40:04.211 --> 00:40:05.080
<v Speaker 1>comedy club there.</v>

1352
00:40:05.081 --> 00:40:05.590
<v Speaker 1>I saved,</v>

1353
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.131
<v Speaker 1>I saved some,</v>

1354
00:40:06.131 --> 00:40:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I got some money.</v>

1355
00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1356
00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1357
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.830
<v Speaker 1>I lost some of those losses.</v>

1358
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:10.420
<v Speaker 1>I kept some job.</v>

1359
00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1360
00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.510
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying you're not working here necessarily.</v>

1361
00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like going and doing standup.</v>

1362
00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm focusing on standup.</v>

1363
00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I have my agent and I have management and everything is happening.</v>

1364
00:40:21.931 --> 00:40:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1365
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:25.690
<v Speaker 1>last year I did JFL I'm handling it.</v>

1366
00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm handling your some clubs right now because in those places that has like a</v>

1367
00:40:30.011 --> 00:40:31.270
<v Speaker 1>huge Brazilian community.</v>

1368
00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1369
00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing an English,</v>

1370
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.360
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a throw a little Portuguese in there with them.</v>

1371
00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1372
00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.970
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1373
00:40:38.971 --> 00:40:39.810
<v Speaker 1>that's new man.</v>

1374
00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:40.653
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1375
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I did everything that I wanted to do in Brazil.</v>

1376
00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I did a talk show,</v>

1377
00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I did movies,</v>

1378
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I did in my old series.</v>

1379
00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.210
<v Speaker 1>I directed a movie director,</v>

1380
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.240
<v Speaker 1>the Cedars and I thought it was like I'm 42,</v>

1381
00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.270
<v Speaker 1>it's time for me to try something new.</v>

1382
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.580
<v Speaker 1>That's why I came here and I'm using my son about that.</v>

1383
00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:00.070
<v Speaker 1>That's the bad part.</v>

1384
00:41:00.071 --> 00:41:00.820
<v Speaker 1>But that's okay.</v>

1385
00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:01.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1386
00:41:01.271 --> 00:41:03.040
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about that before.</v>

1387
00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:03.933
<v Speaker 1>That is a,</v>

1388
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:07.390
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy situation is a very emotional,</v>

1389
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:09.760
<v Speaker 1>bringing my kids there.</v>

1390
00:41:09.761 --> 00:41:09.971
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1391
00:41:09.971 --> 00:41:10.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1392
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:12.340
<v Speaker 1>last time that I was leaving and he was like,</v>

1393
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.980
<v Speaker 1>you find the most important in your life.</v>

1394
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Why are you searching for something so far away?</v>

1395
00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:19.450
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

1396
00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:20.080
<v Speaker 1>and I told him,</v>

1397
00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:20.890
<v Speaker 1>this is important,</v>

1398
00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:22.330
<v Speaker 1>this is very important for me,</v>

1399
00:41:22.331 --> 00:41:23.680
<v Speaker 1>but it is selfish.</v>

1400
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:29.370
<v Speaker 1>This is something that I wanted to do and for my career was important because I</v>

1401
00:41:29.471 --> 00:41:30.304
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

1402
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1403
00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I lost a lot in my country.</v>

1404
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1405
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:36.130
<v Speaker 1>with the lawsuits in the last TV shows,</v>

1406
00:41:36.131 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 1>I lost a lot.</v>

1407
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.210
<v Speaker 1>I lost money.</v>

1408
00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:40.550
<v Speaker 1>I thought was a little dangerous for me to keep doing it over there.</v>

1409
00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.170
<v Speaker 1>And I got a death threat.</v>

1410
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:46.970
<v Speaker 1>There was that made me a little dinner and I didn't actually went public to talk</v>

1411
00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:48.080
<v Speaker 1>about the death threat.</v>

1412
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.000
<v Speaker 1>And as the death threat over,</v>

1413
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:50.991
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

1414
00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:52.800
<v Speaker 1>because one of my last suits,</v>

1415
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:57.050
<v Speaker 1>I cannot be that specific because it was an open.</v>

1416
00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.020
<v Speaker 1>So if I say exactly who he was,</v>

1417
00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.400
<v Speaker 1>now be sued again,</v>

1418
00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:02.060
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1419
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

1420
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1421
00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:03.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1422
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:04.101
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1423
00:42:04.101 --> 00:42:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of gate,</v>

1424
00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.753
<v Speaker 1>I'll be,</v>

1425
00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1426
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.050
<v Speaker 1>offending someone's order because I,</v>

1427
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:14.110
<v Speaker 1>but I knew what happened and I felt I didn't feel safe there for a little bit.</v>

1428
00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that a runaway,</v>

1429
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:22.540
<v Speaker 1>but I can't seem smart to come over here and spend some time and build something</v>

1430
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.080
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1431
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.520
<v Speaker 1>and maybe be here.</v>

1432
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:26.000
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1433
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
<v Speaker 1>it was hard for me that I could get hurt because of the nature of my job.</v>

1434
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Now when you're over here and you're trying to do standup,</v>

1435
00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:34.761
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

1436
00:42:34.761 --> 00:42:35.540
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>

1437
00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.550
<v Speaker 1>do you structure your act out?</v>

1438
00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you have like how do you do it?</v>

1439
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Do you write it out on paper or on a computer?</v>

1440
00:42:42.531 --> 00:42:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you put it up on this thing over here?</v>

1441
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Put it on your phone every year and then I keep rehearsing and I go on stage and</v>

1442
00:42:50.541 --> 00:42:52.250
<v Speaker 1>a half to two and I say it,</v>

1443
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:53.241
<v Speaker 1>that's what I do.</v>

1444
00:42:53.241 --> 00:42:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I memorize everything that I'm going to say.</v>

1445
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Not Everything but a,</v>

1446
00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.380
<v Speaker 1>it gets natural.</v>

1447
00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.670
<v Speaker 1>It's the way you do it.</v>

1448
00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1449
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Just memorize everything that I'm going to write because if I mess up a word or</v>

1450
00:43:05.211 --> 00:43:05.451
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

1451
00:43:05.451 --> 00:43:10.370
<v Speaker 1>I can kill a joke and I want everything to work flawlessly.</v>

1452
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.380
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I memorize.</v>

1453
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.030
<v Speaker 1>It looks natural,</v>

1454
00:43:14.031 --> 00:43:15.410
<v Speaker 1>but I memorize everything.</v>

1455
00:43:15.411 --> 00:43:19.190
<v Speaker 1>But it's very hard for me to interact with the audience because every time</v>

1456
00:43:19.191 --> 00:43:20.240
<v Speaker 1>there's someone like hack,</v>

1457
00:43:20.241 --> 00:43:21.830
<v Speaker 1>call me all jokes,</v>

1458
00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:23.750
<v Speaker 1>all jokes comes in Portuguese in my head</v>

1459
00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:26.870
<v Speaker 1>and I have to translate.</v>

1460
00:43:26.871 --> 00:43:27.141
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1461
00:43:27.141 --> 00:43:27.381
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1462
00:43:27.381 --> 00:43:27.710
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1463
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:28.041
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1464
00:43:28.041 --> 00:43:29.360
<v Speaker 1>At the time and I lose time.</v>

1465
00:43:29.361 --> 00:43:30.650
<v Speaker 1>He's very frustrating.</v>

1466
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.633
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1467
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:33.680
<v Speaker 1>And I even say this on stage,</v>

1468
00:43:33.681 --> 00:43:35.400
<v Speaker 1>like I was doing a show the other day and this guy,</v>

1469
00:43:35.401 --> 00:43:35.871
<v Speaker 1>he just scream,</v>

1470
00:43:35.871 --> 00:43:36.500
<v Speaker 1>you suck.</v>

1471
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:39.830
<v Speaker 1>It was like a batch or was a bar show and what I say to order when it,</v>

1472
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:41.090
<v Speaker 1>when I am stressed out,</v>

1473
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.100
<v Speaker 1>I just mess up words and now always happened.</v>

1474
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:44.001
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

1475
00:43:44.001 --> 00:43:44.271
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>

1476
00:43:44.271 --> 00:43:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to say go fuck yourself.</v>

1477
00:43:45.951 --> 00:43:46.281
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1478
00:43:46.281 --> 00:43:47.670
<v Speaker 1>gonna fuck myself.</v>

1479
00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Look at me like fuck yourself.</v>

1480
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:54.910
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to interact with you.</v>

1481
00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1482
00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.910
<v Speaker 2>most tiny man is difficult to do it in another language.</v>

1483
00:43:58.911 --> 00:44:00.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not my natural thing.</v>

1484
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:01.400
<v Speaker 2>So everything's on your phone.</v>

1485
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:03.860
<v Speaker 2>You don't write it on a computer or a notebook.</v>

1486
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:04.910
<v Speaker 2>You write on a computer?</v>

1487
00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:05.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1488
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:07.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1489
00:44:07.071 --> 00:44:11.000
<v Speaker 2>I ran into computer because I can write and it's easier to type.</v>

1490
00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:12.470
<v Speaker 2>It's first of all,</v>

1491
00:44:12.471 --> 00:44:13.370
<v Speaker 2>it's a bigger right.</v>

1492
00:44:13.371 --> 00:44:16.910
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at a big 15 inch screen and I can type without looking at my</v>

1493
00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:20.480
<v Speaker 2>fingers and so when I have ideas I can get them out really quick and I don't</v>

1494
00:44:20.481 --> 00:44:21.314
<v Speaker 2>have to say them.</v>

1495
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.700
<v Speaker 2>I just look at it on the screen and then I'll write many versions of it and then</v>

1496
00:44:25.701 --> 00:44:29.570
<v Speaker 2>I go over it and I smoke a little weed and then start editing,</v>

1497
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:30.960
<v Speaker 2>twisting it around.</v>

1498
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.600
<v Speaker 2>That's the first word.</v>

1499
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:37.560
<v Speaker 2>What I basically do is I get it to a point where I know that I have something to</v>

1500
00:44:37.561 --> 00:44:38.160
<v Speaker 2>talk about.</v>

1501
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.850
<v Speaker 2>I know I have a framework and I know where there's some punchlines and then I</v>

1502
00:44:41.851 --> 00:44:44.730
<v Speaker 2>write it out on paper so that when I write it down on paper,</v>

1503
00:44:44.731 --> 00:44:46.350
<v Speaker 2>I can see it better in my head.</v>

1504
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I remember it better.</v>

1505
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.860
<v Speaker 2>Then I bring it to the stage,</v>

1506
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.950
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have a rigid structure.</v>

1507
00:44:52.951 --> 00:44:56.700
<v Speaker 2>I loose with it because I want to be able to feel it in the moment,</v>

1508
00:44:56.701 --> 00:44:57.750
<v Speaker 2>whether or not this is good.</v>

1509
00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

1510
00:44:58.410 --> 00:44:58.681
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1511
00:44:58.681 --> 00:44:59.910
<v Speaker 2>So when I go onstage,</v>

1512
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.601
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1513
00:45:00.601 --> 00:45:03.390
<v Speaker 2>say if I'm doing a joke about a coffee,</v>

1514
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:04.543
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1515
00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:05.281
<v Speaker 2>I I'll,</v>

1516
00:45:05.281 --> 00:45:05.761
<v Speaker 2>I'll go,</v>

1517
00:45:05.761 --> 00:45:06.594
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1518
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.280
<v Speaker 2>I drink too much fucking coffee.</v>

1519
00:45:08.281 --> 00:45:10.620
<v Speaker 2>I've got a real problem and here's how I know I have a problem.</v>

1520
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.050
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll go into it and then I'll start talking about all the different</v>

1521
00:45:13.051 --> 00:45:15.940
<v Speaker 2>EHRs and then I'll listen to the recording and I'll go,</v>

1522
00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:16.710
<v Speaker 2>that part sucks.</v>

1523
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:19.950
<v Speaker 2>I got to fix this part and this part is stupid and this part is sloppy.</v>

1524
00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:21.240
<v Speaker 2>But that part got a laugh.</v>

1525
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:21.931
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1526
00:45:21.931 --> 00:45:22.591
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>

1527
00:45:22.591 --> 00:45:24.690
<v Speaker 2>It'd be even funnier if I said it clearer.</v>

1528
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe I need to say it this way,</v>

1529
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:27.241
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1530
00:45:27.241 --> 00:45:28.200
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll just,</v>

1531
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:31.050
<v Speaker 2>and then it's this constant process of writing,</v>

1532
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.430
<v Speaker 2>writing it out,</v>

1533
00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.110
<v Speaker 2>going on stage,</v>

1534
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.100
<v Speaker 2>live recording,</v>

1535
00:45:35.101 --> 00:45:35.760
<v Speaker 2>all sets,</v>

1536
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.130
<v Speaker 2>listening to the recording and then writing again.</v>

1537
00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

1538
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:39.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1539
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:41.820
<v Speaker 2>when you listen to those sets,</v>

1540
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:46.980
<v Speaker 2>do you keep the funny ones or is there sometime they should do like a funny</v>

1541
00:45:46.981 --> 00:45:47.221
<v Speaker 2>joke,</v>

1542
00:45:47.221 --> 00:45:48.180
<v Speaker 2>but you don't like it?</v>

1543
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Does that happen to some type of thing?</v>

1544
00:45:50.151 --> 00:45:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1545
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1547
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1548
00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:52.240
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1549
00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:52.840
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.020
<v Speaker 2>it's fuel ship.</v>

1551
00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Cheap.</v>

1552
00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Cheap.</v>

1553
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1554
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1555
00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.330
<v Speaker 2>But he was funny.</v>

1556
00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:57.960
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1557
00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:58.741
<v Speaker 2>you've got to laugh,</v>

1558
00:45:58.741 --> 00:46:00.060
<v Speaker 2>but it's not good.</v>

1559
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:00.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1560
00:46:00.481 --> 00:46:01.111
<v Speaker 2>That's sure.</v>

1561
00:46:01.111 --> 00:46:01.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1562
00:46:01.381 --> 00:46:01.951
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1563
00:46:01.951 --> 00:46:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1564
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:03.570
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be careful that you don't,</v>

1565
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:05.190
<v Speaker 2>he don't want to be a hack,</v>

1566
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:05.731
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1567
00:46:05.731 --> 00:46:06.161
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

1568
00:46:06.161 --> 00:46:07.410
<v Speaker 2>that's what a hack is.</v>

1569
00:46:07.411 --> 00:46:12.411
<v Speaker 2>Someone who tells like obvious stupid jokes that only make dumb people laugh or</v>

1570
00:46:12.841 --> 00:46:13.621
<v Speaker 2>someone who does.</v>

1571
00:46:13.621 --> 00:46:15.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired.</v>

1572
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Beaten down material.</v>

1573
00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 2>Like the jokes that you know,</v>

1574
00:46:18.781 --> 00:46:20.100
<v Speaker 2>that other people have done already.</v>

1575
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:21.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1576
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:25.080
<v Speaker 2>you to know that you just would know based on your,</v>

1577
00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:25.441
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1578
00:46:25.441 --> 00:46:25.621
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1579
00:46:25.621 --> 00:46:27.600
<v Speaker 2>here's a perfect example that Stephen Fry,</v>

1580
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.721
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1581
00:46:27.721 --> 00:46:27.901
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1582
00:46:27.901 --> 00:46:28.734
<v Speaker 2>Stephen Fry says,</v>

1583
00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:29.041
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1584
00:46:29.041 --> 00:46:29.874
<v Speaker 2>this is a famous comedian.</v>

1585
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.650
<v Speaker 2>He used this recently.</v>

1586
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:32.491
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1587
00:46:32.491 --> 00:46:32.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1588
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.600
<v Speaker 2>something about,</v>

1589
00:46:33.601 --> 00:46:33.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1590
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:34.320
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

1591
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I would love to come back to life as a drug sniffing dog.</v>

1592
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:38.851
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1593
00:46:38.851 --> 00:46:41.160
<v Speaker 2>could you imagine being a drug sniffing dog at the airport?</v>

1594
00:46:41.161 --> 00:46:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Just smelling everything.</v>

1595
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1596
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:43.530
<v Speaker 2>AH,</v>

1597
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:44.220
<v Speaker 2>getting high.</v>

1598
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Like he was saying about how that is such an obvious stupid joke.</v>

1599
00:46:49.471 --> 00:46:50.910
<v Speaker 2>It's so many people have done that.</v>

1600
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:56.270
<v Speaker 2>And that's a joke where man I bet probably hundreds of comedians are doing,</v>

1601
00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:57.240
<v Speaker 2>don't joke about that.</v>

1602
00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.220
<v Speaker 2>It's just like an obvious premise.</v>

1603
00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:00.570
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1604
00:47:00.571 --> 00:47:04.050
<v Speaker 2>like you were saying earlier that sometimes people would say jokes that you've</v>

1605
00:47:04.051 --> 00:47:05.910
<v Speaker 2>said and you,</v>

1606
00:47:05.911 --> 00:47:06.151
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1607
00:47:06.151 --> 00:47:07.140
<v Speaker 2>you have a hard time explaining.</v>

1608
00:47:07.141 --> 00:47:08.280
<v Speaker 2>That's my joke.</v>

1609
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:11.910
<v Speaker 2>And to them it's just an anecdote or then it's just something funny that they</v>

1610
00:47:11.911 --> 00:47:12.540
<v Speaker 2>heard.</v>

1611
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people go on stage and their act consists of really obvious premises</v>

1612
00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.580
<v Speaker 2>that they have probably already heard someone covered before.</v>

1613
00:47:20.581 --> 00:47:21.270
<v Speaker 2>That's a hack.</v>

1614
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1615
00:47:21.571 --> 00:47:23.490
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's difficult.</v>

1616
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1617
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:28.890
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge challenge for me because I have been doing for 17 years,</v>

1618
00:47:28.891 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 2>but in another country,</v>

1619
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.020
<v Speaker 2>so you guys,</v>

1620
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.370
<v Speaker 2>you guys,</v>

1621
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:37.420
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge role that you guys already followed.</v>

1622
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:40.090
<v Speaker 2>So if you hear something about that's old,</v>

1623
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe for me it's not right.</v>

1624
00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:46.050
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want to be that guy in,</v>

1625
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:49.720
<v Speaker 2>in what I realize is that people don't point that out to you.</v>

1626
00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:50.081
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1627
00:47:50.081 --> 00:47:51.040
<v Speaker 2>you could ask people.</v>

1628
00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:51.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1629
00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:51.941
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1630
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:53.200
<v Speaker 2>If you're friends with comics,</v>

1631
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:54.070
<v Speaker 2>like okay,</v>

1632
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:54.730
<v Speaker 2>you could ask.</v>

1633
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1634
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.980
<v Speaker 2>And they'll tell you.</v>

1635
00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1636
00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:56.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1637
00:47:56.831 --> 00:47:57.491
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>

1638
00:47:57.491 --> 00:47:58.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1639
00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:01.960
<v Speaker 2>like a the other day this guy was doing a joke and I kind of thought about,</v>

1640
00:48:01.961 --> 00:48:02.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1641
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:03.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1642
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:03.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1643
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.070
<v Speaker 2>taglines,</v>

1644
00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:04.591
<v Speaker 2>a tagline.</v>

1645
00:48:04.591 --> 00:48:05.424
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1646
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:07.510
<v Speaker 2>And he got uncomfortable for me,</v>

1647
00:48:07.511 --> 00:48:08.960
<v Speaker 2>like telling he all of this,</v>

1648
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:09.821
<v Speaker 2>what about this?</v>

1649
00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:10.301
<v Speaker 2>And feels was like,</v>

1650
00:48:10.301 --> 00:48:11.134
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1651
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:12.003
<v Speaker 2>it will,</v>

1652
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:12.881
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult,</v>

1653
00:48:12.881 --> 00:48:14.060
<v Speaker 2>man to connect with comedians.</v>

1654
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not that easy because they all have huge problems.</v>

1655
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.331
<v Speaker 2>They all have.</v>

1656
00:48:18.331 --> 00:48:19.164
<v Speaker 2>And Man,</v>

1657
00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:20.710
<v Speaker 2>I was like in a group of guys,</v>

1658
00:48:20.711 --> 00:48:22.990
<v Speaker 2>one was like ex drug addict and the,</v>

1659
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.170
<v Speaker 2>the ones was a drunk and they had like huge problems and I was like,</v>

1660
00:48:26.171 --> 00:48:27.670
<v Speaker 2>I have friends.</v>

1661
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:31.143
<v Speaker 2>I don't</v>

1662
00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:32.920
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1663
00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:33.191
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1664
00:48:33.191 --> 00:48:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1665
00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:34.571
<v Speaker 2>You got to be like,</v>

1666
00:48:34.571 --> 00:48:34.811
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1667
00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:39.460
<v Speaker 2>you've got a jeep and you've got a fucking goal into the bottom to search for</v>

1668
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:40.330
<v Speaker 2>something good.</v>

1669
00:48:40.331 --> 00:48:42.010
<v Speaker 2>And I understand this process,</v>

1670
00:48:42.011 --> 00:48:42.970
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

1671
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.540
<v Speaker 2>do I really have to go through all that to come with them?</v>

1672
00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:47.380
<v Speaker 2>Something Great.</v>

1673
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:47.711
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1674
00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:49.540
<v Speaker 2>you don't get ideas.</v>

1675
00:48:49.541 --> 00:48:50.800
<v Speaker 2>And this crystal,</v>

1676
00:48:50.801 --> 00:48:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Leah actually has a bit about that I don't want to do as bit,</v>

1677
00:48:53.471 --> 00:48:57.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's basically a bit about how good his childhood was and how close he is</v>

1678
00:48:57.311 --> 00:48:57.941
<v Speaker 2>with his family.</v>

1679
00:48:57.941 --> 00:49:01.180
<v Speaker 2>And everybody thinks that you have to have a fucked up childhood to be Canadian.</v>

1680
00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1681
00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:02.891
<v Speaker 2>it's not true.</v>

1682
00:49:02.891 --> 00:49:03.850
<v Speaker 2>You just have to be funny.</v>

1683
00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.680
<v Speaker 2>People are funny for different reasons.</v>

1684
00:49:05.681 --> 00:49:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Some people are funny because they always enjoy standup.</v>

1685
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:08.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you,</v>

1686
00:49:08.321 --> 00:49:11.770
<v Speaker 2>if you grow up in joining standup comedy and then become a standup comedian,</v>

1687
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.880
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with that.</v>

1688
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:14.860
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be a drug addict.</v>

1689
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:16.023
<v Speaker 2>Do you?</v>

1690
00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:18.010
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1691
00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.040
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not going to be because I tried,</v>

1692
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:20.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1693
00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:21.683
<v Speaker 2>Marie,</v>

1694
00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.113
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1695
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Once two years ago and I stayed hide for 14 days straight of God's man.</v>

1696
00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Did you eat it 14 days.</v>

1697
00:49:33.111 --> 00:49:35.170
<v Speaker 2>And I dunno if smoke it wasn't a vaporizer.</v>

1698
00:49:35.171 --> 00:49:35.520
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

1699
00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:35.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1700
00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:36.291
<v Speaker 2>vaporize.</v>

1701
00:49:36.291 --> 00:49:36.941
<v Speaker 2>Vaporize it.</v>

1702
00:49:36.941 --> 00:49:37.774
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1703
00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:42.440
<v Speaker 2>And I say hi for 14 days and I thought it doesn't right.</v>

1704
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:43.270
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

1705
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.931
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't high.</v>

1706
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1707
00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Well I really wasn't the second day,</v>

1708
00:49:46.631 --> 00:49:47.464
<v Speaker 2>right like it,</v>

1709
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:50.110
<v Speaker 2>but I thought it was like disconnected from reality.</v>

1710
00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Well sometimes that does happen and I know a story about a guy who is a straight</v>

1711
00:49:54.441 --> 00:49:59.080
<v Speaker 2>laced guy who took some marijuana edibles so that he could get to sleep and he</v>

1712
00:49:59.081 --> 00:50:00.940
<v Speaker 2>had a real problem.</v>

1713
00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:06.120
<v Speaker 2>Like he got suicidal and freaked out and became just irrationally anxious.</v>

1714
00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:12.570
<v Speaker 2>He had crippling anxiety and some time for some time for weeks and he's a</v>

1715
00:50:12.761 --> 00:50:15.790
<v Speaker 2>confident guy and a very handsome,</v>

1716
00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.320
<v Speaker 2>big muscular guy.</v>

1717
00:50:17.321 --> 00:50:20.350
<v Speaker 2>Like he just like you would never imagine this guy have any antianxiety.</v>

1718
00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I think some people have just the chemistry of different individuals.</v>

1719
00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't bar for that and that's what the doctor told me because</v>

1720
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 1>I went to the psychiatrist.</v>

1721
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:30.141
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

1722
00:50:30.141 --> 00:50:30.974
<v Speaker 1>you went to sleep.</v>

1723
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:33.110
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God,</v>

1724
00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:34.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead week.</v>

1725
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:38.990
<v Speaker 1>That week I went to the psych guy through smell and I told him no,</v>

1726
00:50:38.991 --> 00:50:43.280
<v Speaker 1>I smoked that thing like 14 days ago and I still high in.</v>

1727
00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.680
<v Speaker 1>He looked at me and he gave me some,</v>

1728
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:48.440
<v Speaker 1>some cycle one,</v>

1729
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.170
<v Speaker 1>he gave me some pills and I was like,</v>

1730
00:50:51.171 --> 00:50:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1731
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.200
<v Speaker 1>if you stay high until tomorrow,</v>

1732
00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:54.110
<v Speaker 1>take these pills.</v>

1733
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Because what he told me,</v>

1734
00:50:55.581 --> 00:51:00.581
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I didn't know that he can be a trigger if you're has some</v>

1735
00:51:00.591 --> 00:51:04.610
<v Speaker 1>tendencies of his schizophrenia and a psychopath,</v>

1736
00:51:04.611 --> 00:51:05.900
<v Speaker 1>or if you have,</v>

1737
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:07.280
<v Speaker 1>which was not my case.</v>

1738
00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:08.870
<v Speaker 1>And He's told this is very rare,</v>

1739
00:51:08.871 --> 00:51:09.740
<v Speaker 1>but it can happen,</v>

1740
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:11.090
<v Speaker 1>which is not your case.</v>

1741
00:51:11.091 --> 00:51:11.400
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1742
00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:16.400
<v Speaker 1>it was happy because of the up and the next day I was okay and I felt okay and I</v>

1743
00:51:17.391 --> 00:51:19.520
<v Speaker 1>did and took the pills and it was crazy,</v>

1744
00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:20.010
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1745
00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Fuck crazy.</v>

1746
00:51:21.021 --> 00:51:21.830
<v Speaker 1>And I remember that I,</v>

1747
00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I decided to record it,</v>

1748
00:51:23.451 --> 00:51:24.500
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

1749
00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:24.950
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1750
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:25.640
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

1751
00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.920
<v Speaker 1>let me record what I'm thinking.</v>

1752
00:51:27.921 --> 00:51:29.990
<v Speaker 1>At least let's get some good experience out of it.</v>

1753
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.690
<v Speaker 1>And I remembered that it started to record and I said,</v>

1754
00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:35.360
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to record everything that I'm thinking.</v>

1755
00:51:35.361 --> 00:51:37.160
<v Speaker 1>And when I look at the cell phone,</v>

1756
00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:38.120
<v Speaker 1>it was 45 minutes,</v>

1757
00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:39.750
<v Speaker 1>45 minutes of talking.</v>

1758
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't even realize I just said that I'm going to record now and there was</v>

1759
00:51:43.911 --> 00:51:47.390
<v Speaker 1>45 minutes and when I listen to like 15 days after that,</v>

1760
00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:48.350
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1761
00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:49.011
<v Speaker 1>I'm so crazy.</v>

1762
00:51:49.011 --> 00:51:49.844
<v Speaker 1>I'm so crazy.</v>

1763
00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:51.403
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

1764
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:52.753
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna die.</v>

1765
00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to understand that.</v>

1766
00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:55.430
<v Speaker 1>My son's talking.</v>

1767
00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:55.651
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1768
00:51:55.651 --> 00:51:57.380
<v Speaker 1>there's my son talking to me right now.</v>

1769
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1770
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.160
<v Speaker 1>That was one hit of available.</v>

1771
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:00.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1772
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:02.760
<v Speaker 1>it was more than one a budget hit.</v>

1773
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:03.830
<v Speaker 1>It was a bunch.</v>

1774
00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1775
00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:05.120
<v Speaker 1>you're too tall.</v>

1776
00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:05.721
<v Speaker 1>You're big.</v>

1777
00:52:05.721 --> 00:52:08.240
<v Speaker 1>You're like a 250 pounds.</v>

1778
00:52:08.241 --> 00:52:10.100
<v Speaker 1>So fucking use it a lot.</v>

1779
00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:10.341
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1780
00:52:10.341 --> 00:52:12.290
<v Speaker 1>so they were saying keep hitting it because you're tall.</v>

1781
00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Because I wasn't feeling it.</v>

1782
00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

1783
00:52:14.691 --> 00:52:15.800
<v Speaker 1>But when I felt it,</v>

1784
00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I felt for 14</v>

1785
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:18.940
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1786
00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.640
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the big problems with people when they first try,</v>

1787
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:22.610
<v Speaker 1>they tried too much.</v>

1788
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:24.141
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>

1789
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:24.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1790
00:52:24.291 --> 00:52:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Someone just says take another hit.</v>

1791
00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It is a happy man.</v>

1792
00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:27.201
<v Speaker 1>I tell people,</v>

1793
00:52:27.201 --> 00:52:29.330
<v Speaker 1>if you thinking about trying marijuana going there a little bit,</v>

1794
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:30.703
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1795
00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:31.491
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel anything.</v>

1796
00:52:31.491 --> 00:52:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>

1797
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.983
<v Speaker 1>Leave it alone.</v>

1798
00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:33.560
<v Speaker 1>It'll.</v>

1799
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.210
<v Speaker 1>You'll eventually feel something that's done for,</v>

1800
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:35.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1801
00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:36.513
<v Speaker 1>it's leave it alone.</v>

1802
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:37.401
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy,</v>

1803
00:52:37.401 --> 00:52:37.760
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1804
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.630
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people selling weeds and stuff in there.</v>

1805
00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.650
<v Speaker 1>This is not even cool anymore.</v>

1806
00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:43.903
<v Speaker 1>Weed's not cool.</v>

1807
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.233
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1808
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:47.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like people are suffering.</v>

1809
00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.140
<v Speaker 1>When I do shows,</v>

1810
00:52:48.141 --> 00:52:49.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people talk about why this book,</v>

1811
00:52:49.431 --> 00:52:50.870
<v Speaker 1>this and his mouth that he was like,</v>

1812
00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:51.681
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1813
00:52:51.681 --> 00:52:52.670
<v Speaker 1>it's legal now.</v>

1814
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Juice.</v>

1815
00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:56.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not dangerous and I think it's good.</v>

1816
00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:57.111
<v Speaker 1>He has to be.</v>

1817
00:52:57.111 --> 00:52:57.560
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1818
00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1819
00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Well it definitely should be.</v>

1820
00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:01.580
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't affect me that way for me.</v>

1821
00:53:01.581 --> 00:53:03.050
<v Speaker 1>I've been smoking in a long time.</v>

1822
00:53:03.051 --> 00:53:03.884
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty easy.</v>

1823
00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:05.520
<v Speaker 1>I just chills me out.</v>

1824
00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Makes me,</v>

1825
00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.400
<v Speaker 1>it actually makes me nicer.</v>

1826
00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.100
<v Speaker 1>It makes me like a more calm person.</v>

1827
00:53:10.101 --> 00:53:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Does that makes more,</v>

1828
00:53:10.941 --> 00:53:12.710
<v Speaker 1>more sensitive to other people's feelings?</v>

1829
00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever smoke because you fell that short intervals or like stressed the</v>

1830
00:53:16.481 --> 00:53:17.830
<v Speaker 1>house and no,</v>

1831
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to treat,</v>

1832
00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to perform well in this meeting or something and he just smoking.</v>

1833
00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:23.451
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1834
00:53:23.451 --> 00:53:24.950
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work like that for me.</v>

1835
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm stressed</v>

1836
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:27.660
<v Speaker 2>out and I work out,</v>

1837
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:28.611
<v Speaker 2>if I'm stressed out,</v>

1838
00:53:28.611 --> 00:53:28.890
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1839
00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:30.840
<v Speaker 2>that's my best for alleviating that.</v>

1840
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana is good for me for thinking,</v>

1841
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:37.110
<v Speaker 2>for contemplating and going over things and it's not,</v>

1842
00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:38.940
<v Speaker 2>it's not good for me for stress.</v>

1843
00:53:38.941 --> 00:53:39.660
<v Speaker 2>Like for street.</v>

1844
00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.970
<v Speaker 2>What if I feel like tense tension I work out.</v>

1845
00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:43.590
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1846
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:44.790
<v Speaker 2>that's what gets it out of me.</v>

1847
00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:47.070
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to ask you one thing.</v>

1848
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:49.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1849
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:50.520
<v Speaker 2>it's completely different subjects.</v>

1850
00:53:50.521 --> 00:53:51.354
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask,</v>

1851
00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:53.293
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1852
00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:54.880
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing interviews at the end,</v>

1853
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:55.723
<v Speaker 2>those fights,</v>

1854
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:59.410
<v Speaker 2>did you ever feel threatened somehow know what looks like wait,</v>

1855
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:01.260
<v Speaker 2>at least once I'm s no,</v>

1856
00:54:01.261 --> 00:54:01.441
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1857
00:54:01.441 --> 00:54:01.561
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1858
00:54:01.561 --> 00:54:02.040
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1859
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:07.040
<v Speaker 2>One thing that I hope the fighters realizes that what I'm trying to do is only</v>

1860
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.990
<v Speaker 2>get them to express themselves.</v>

1861
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.400
<v Speaker 2>I want them to shine.</v>

1862
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.380
<v Speaker 2>I really genuinely want them.</v>

1863
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.020
<v Speaker 2>They won this big fight I want,</v>

1864
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.650
<v Speaker 2>I want them to express themselves.</v>

1865
00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:19.590
<v Speaker 2>I want them to maybe maximize their marketing,</v>

1866
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:23.040
<v Speaker 2>their marketability and just like tell the world how they feel.</v>

1867
00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:28.250
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a credibly unusual experience to win a big fight in the cage on</v>

1868
00:54:29.131 --> 00:54:31.320
<v Speaker 2>paper view in front of millions of people.</v>

1869
00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:36.810
<v Speaker 2>My goal is only to try to get them to communicate the better and to let them</v>

1870
00:54:36.811 --> 00:54:38.940
<v Speaker 2>know that I'm there to support them.</v>

1871
00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:40.440
<v Speaker 2>That's all I'm ever trying to do.</v>

1872
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.980
<v Speaker 2>Or if it,</v>

1873
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:41.430
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1874
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:42.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1875
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Like I was saying before,</v>

1876
00:54:43.501 --> 00:54:44.730
<v Speaker 2>before we started talking to,</v>

1877
00:54:44.731 --> 00:54:46.560
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of fight at friends and MMA.</v>

1878
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Sweetest guys.</v>

1879
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:50.700
<v Speaker 2>People consider what they do for a living.</v>

1880
00:54:50.701 --> 00:54:51.300
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1881
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:52.111
<v Speaker 2>So crazy.</v>

1882
00:54:52.111 --> 00:54:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1883
00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Damn young from that lay.</v>

1884
00:54:54.211 --> 00:54:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1885
00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Ninja Shogun.</v>

1886
00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:56.910
<v Speaker 2>They'll,</v>

1887
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:57.271
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1888
00:54:57.271 --> 00:54:58.740
<v Speaker 2>how's Ninja doing these days,</v>

1889
00:54:58.741 --> 00:54:59.371
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

1890
00:54:59.371 --> 00:55:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Add less time to talk to him.</v>

1891
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:02.761
<v Speaker 2>He got some,</v>

1892
00:55:02.761 --> 00:55:03.600
<v Speaker 2>he got some,</v>

1893
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:04.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1894
00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:06.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was because of the fighting.</v>

1895
00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:07.830
<v Speaker 2>I cannot say that,</v>

1896
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.090
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1897
00:55:09.091 --> 00:55:11.550
<v Speaker 2>he's speech sheets a little slow.</v>

1898
00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:13.920
<v Speaker 2>It is already hard to understand.</v>

1899
00:55:13.921 --> 00:55:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Even Shogun,</v>

1900
00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:15.931
<v Speaker 2>they have this,</v>

1901
00:55:15.931 --> 00:55:17.790
<v Speaker 2>what they called the whole nace,</v>

1902
00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:19.590
<v Speaker 2>which is the way of speaking.</v>

1903
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:21.450
<v Speaker 2>They come from at this state,</v>

1904
00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:23.970
<v Speaker 2>which is very hard to understand what they say from queer timber.</v>

1905
00:55:23.971 --> 00:55:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1906
00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1907
00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Could achieve by people.</v>

1908
00:55:25.861 --> 00:55:26.600
<v Speaker 2>We don't poker chips.</v>

1909
00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when we speak to too fast,</v>

1910
00:55:28.531 --> 00:55:29.640
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand that much.</v>

1911
00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:30.980
<v Speaker 2>But a Nisha,</v>

1912
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:32.130
<v Speaker 2>I think he got some,</v>

1913
00:55:32.131 --> 00:55:34.800
<v Speaker 2>some injuries and the scars in his head.</v>

1914
00:55:34.801 --> 00:55:38.370
<v Speaker 2>I think he got some surgeries and I think he had surgery on her.</v>

1915
00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:39.360
<v Speaker 2>She was fine at the time.</v>

1916
00:55:39.361 --> 00:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>People are kicking people in soccer kicking and he was one of the best.</v>

1917
00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:44.720
<v Speaker 2>He was good.</v>

1918
00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:44.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1919
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:45.780
<v Speaker 2>he was an animal.</v>

1920
00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:47.280
<v Speaker 2>He was really young too.</v>

1921
00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:50.160
<v Speaker 2>And at the end he was like getting knocked out with slaps.</v>

1922
00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.520
<v Speaker 2>That's the scariest thing is when you see their chin go,</v>

1923
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:55.800
<v Speaker 2>when their ability to take a po.</v>

1924
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:56.663
<v Speaker 2>What's craziest?</v>

1925
00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Shogun seems to be making a resurgence.</v>

1926
00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:00.023
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1927
00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:01.320
<v Speaker 2>He amazing.</v>

1928
00:56:01.321 --> 00:56:05.640
<v Speaker 2>He w I w I will you still be very good friends with one of his coaches.</v>

1929
00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:09.300
<v Speaker 2>And after the fight would Henderson the first one,</v>

1930
00:56:09.301 --> 00:56:10.320
<v Speaker 2>which was like a grand,</v>

1931
00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:12.050
<v Speaker 2>remembered that fucking chaos.</v>

1932
00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:12.990
<v Speaker 2>That was a chaos.</v>

1933
00:56:12.991 --> 00:56:15.240
<v Speaker 2>And I was talking to him and he was like,</v>

1934
00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:19.500
<v Speaker 2>you don't even imagine how talent that this guy is.</v>

1935
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:21.330
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1936
00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 2>he kind of focus,</v>

1937
00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:23.830
<v Speaker 2>if he was focused,</v>

1938
00:56:23.831 --> 00:56:26.320
<v Speaker 2>he would kick his ass in life fucking tour minutes.</v>

1939
00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:27.430
<v Speaker 2>So he just,</v>

1940
00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:31.300
<v Speaker 2>that's the way they do it in the shoe box.</v>

1941
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.190
<v Speaker 2>They like to fight.</v>

1942
00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.230
<v Speaker 2>They like to fucking just go at it.</v>

1943
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:40.870
<v Speaker 2>He m and Cyborg and of underlay and understand are sort of the same thing the</v>

1944
00:56:42.461 --> 00:56:43.220
<v Speaker 2>way they do.</v>

1945
00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:44.170
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

1946
00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:48.900
<v Speaker 2>let's go to war and sometimes the game changed in,</v>

1947
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:50.320
<v Speaker 2>but shoguns like learning,</v>

1948
00:56:50.321 --> 00:56:50.951
<v Speaker 2>you can see the,</v>

1949
00:56:50.951 --> 00:56:53.290
<v Speaker 2>he's like improving Steven proofing and like,</v>

1950
00:56:53.291 --> 00:56:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I think this is like 36,</v>

1951
00:56:54.521 --> 00:56:54.851
<v Speaker 2>34.</v>

1952
00:56:54.851 --> 00:56:55.541
<v Speaker 2>His last fight,</v>

1953
00:56:55.541 --> 00:56:56.800
<v Speaker 2>he looks sensation Aman.</v>

1954
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean he looked like a fucking killer is crazy.</v>

1955
00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.970
<v Speaker 2>He can take a shot again now.</v>

1956
00:57:00.971 --> 00:57:01.511
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

1957
00:57:01.511 --> 00:57:02.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1958
00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:06.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean he got knocked out by a few different guys and he's lost some fights,</v>

1959
00:57:06.131 --> 00:57:06.941
<v Speaker 2>some tough fights,</v>

1960
00:57:06.941 --> 00:57:09.640
<v Speaker 2>but his last fight he looked as good as he's looking years.</v>

1961
00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:10.330
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1962
00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:12.220
<v Speaker 2>it's sad for me when I see like,</v>

1963
00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.113
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1964
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why he's always with Brazina's but when I see like an old,</v>

1965
00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:20.200
<v Speaker 2>an old fighter getting his ass beat too quick.</v>

1966
00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:20.710
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1967
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I remember his fight with Sonnen.</v>

1968
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:23.290
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

1969
00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:24.250
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

1970
00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:24.611
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1971
00:57:24.611 --> 00:57:25.360
<v Speaker 2>well he got caught.</v>

1972
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.500
<v Speaker 2>He got caught in a guillotine.</v>

1973
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:27.333
<v Speaker 2>But it's fast.</v>

1974
00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:30.250
<v Speaker 2>The guy pre framed for like six months.</v>

1975
00:57:30.251 --> 00:57:31.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's very frustrating.</v>

1976
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Remember when rice,</v>

1977
00:57:33.401 --> 00:57:35.860
<v Speaker 2>he went back to five with Hugues down was like,</v>

1978
00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:36.843
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1979
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:39.280
<v Speaker 2>well Matt Hughes was in his prime then,</v>

1980
00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:39.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1981
00:57:39.611 --> 00:57:42.760
<v Speaker 2>and he was so strong and the boys just wasn't,</v>

1982
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:44.760
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't physically capable to do it.</v>

1983
00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1984
00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.330
<v Speaker 2>He didn't look the same,</v>

1985
00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:46.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1986
00:57:46.781 --> 00:57:51.090
<v Speaker 2>it just didn't look like he was physically capable the same way in.</v>

1987
00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:52.180
<v Speaker 2>And you know Matt,</v>

1988
00:57:52.181 --> 00:57:53.200
<v Speaker 2>he was his fucking talent.</v>

1989
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievably talented.</v>

1990
00:57:54.461 --> 00:57:55.030
<v Speaker 2>And when he,</v>

1991
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:56.210
<v Speaker 2>when he got on top of hoisting,</v>

1992
00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:57.011
<v Speaker 2>it was smashing him.</v>

1993
00:57:57.011 --> 00:57:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1994
00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.480
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1995
00:57:58.481 --> 00:57:59.291
<v Speaker 2>that's hard to watch.</v>

1996
00:57:59.291 --> 00:57:59.960
<v Speaker 2>How to watch.</v>

1997
00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1998
00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:02.230
<v Speaker 2>but that's the life.</v>

1999
00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is the life they chose.</v>

2000
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2001
00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:05.381
<v Speaker 2>a chocolate.</v>

2002
00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Dell just got knocked out by Tito Ortiz and that was hard to watch because you</v>

2003
00:58:08.771 --> 00:58:10.170
<v Speaker 2>could tell he just can't take a punch.</v>

2004
00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:12.040
<v Speaker 2>And I wasn't that five that went in there to wash it.</v>

2005
00:58:12.041 --> 00:58:12.431
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2006
00:58:12.431 --> 00:58:13.031
<v Speaker 2>it was bad.</v>

2007
00:58:13.031 --> 00:58:13.480
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2008
00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:13.871
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>

2009
00:58:13.871 --> 00:58:15.580
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't moving right either.</v>

2010
00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:18.910
<v Speaker 2>The thing about when fighters take a lot of knockout losses,</v>

2011
00:58:18.911 --> 00:58:23.911
<v Speaker 2>one of the things it's very becomes a parent is there balance looks off and</v>

2012
00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:26.470
<v Speaker 2>their movement doesn't look the same.</v>

2013
00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Like their neurology,</v>

2014
00:58:28.091 --> 00:58:28.331
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

2015
00:58:28.331 --> 00:58:28.720
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

2016
00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:32.620
<v Speaker 2>their body doesn't move as you can look the same but it doesn't react the same</v>

2017
00:58:32.621 --> 00:58:33.454
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2018
00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean even Anderson when he lost his style bender,</v>

2019
00:58:35.741 --> 00:58:40.300
<v Speaker 2>I think style bender would have been a tough fight for him at any point in his</v>

2020
00:58:40.301 --> 00:58:40.610
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>

2021
00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Cause style bender is just fantastic,</v>

2022
00:58:42.971 --> 00:58:43.960
<v Speaker 2>super technical.</v>

2023
00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:48.730
<v Speaker 2>But Anderson looked like he was a step behind the Anderson of old,</v>

2024
00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:52.240
<v Speaker 2>like the Anderson that knocked out Vituro the Anderson that,</v>

2025
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:52.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2026
00:58:52.781 --> 00:58:54.190
<v Speaker 2>you go back to the early days,</v>

2027
00:58:54.191 --> 00:58:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Anderson that knocked out Chael Sonnen and Anderson was a fucking,</v>

2028
00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:00.430
<v Speaker 2>he was just an assassin.</v>

2029
00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:01.690
<v Speaker 2>He was so good.</v>

2030
00:59:01.691 --> 00:59:03.340
<v Speaker 2>He just knew what to do and when to do it.</v>

2031
00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:04.630
<v Speaker 2>And when the style bender fight,</v>

2032
00:59:04.631 --> 00:59:06.670
<v Speaker 2>he just looked like he was a little off little office.</v>

2033
00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.980
<v Speaker 2>But he's also 46 I see.</v>

2034
00:59:08.981 --> 00:59:09.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2035
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.880
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2036
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.830
<v Speaker 2>I think he's won one year older than me.</v>

2037
00:59:11.831 --> 00:59:13.630
<v Speaker 2>He's 43 he's only 42 yeah,</v>

2038
00:59:13.631 --> 00:59:13.901
<v Speaker 2>we did.</v>

2039
00:59:13.901 --> 00:59:14.051
<v Speaker 2>We did,</v>

2040
00:59:14.051 --> 00:59:15.010
<v Speaker 2>we did a show together.</v>

2041
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2043
00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:22.310

2054
00:59:42.081 --> 00:59:42.670
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2055
00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:43.960

2056
00:59:43.961 --> 00:59:44.960
<v Speaker 1>So he's a sweet guy.</v>

2057
00:59:44.961 --> 00:59:45.794
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy,</v>

2058
00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:46.753
<v Speaker 1>great guy.</v>

2059
00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:47.420
<v Speaker 1>He's a great,</v>

2060
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:47.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2061
00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:49.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's one of the all time greats.</v>

2062
00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:50.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2063
00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I had the honor of calling a lot of his fights</v>

2064
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:53.480
<v Speaker 1>in his crazy because,</v>

2065
00:59:53.481 --> 00:59:53.811
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2066
00:59:53.811 --> 00:59:54.710
<v Speaker 1>And it's crazy.</v>

2067
00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2068
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:56.570
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about the God,</v>

2069
00:59:56.571 --> 00:59:57.530
<v Speaker 1>the guy's getting older.</v>

2070
00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:58.361
<v Speaker 1>I remember I taught,</v>

2071
00:59:58.361 --> 00:59:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I taught with Minataro.</v>

2072
00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2073
01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:03.140
<v Speaker 1>he was like three or four and it was like two,</v>

2074
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:03.890
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2075
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:05.930
<v Speaker 1>two fights after he actually retired.</v>

2076
01:00:05.931 --> 01:00:06.501
<v Speaker 1>And I asked him,</v>

2077
01:00:06.501 --> 01:00:06.740
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

2078
01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:07.580
<v Speaker 1>why you keep doing it,</v>

2079
01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:08.540
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to,</v>

2080
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.373
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

2081
01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:11.480
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to prove anything to another one.</v>

2082
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:12.680
<v Speaker 1>And what he said to me,</v>

2083
01:00:12.681 --> 01:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>I think was so fair.</v>

2084
01:00:13.971 --> 01:00:14.804
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

2085
01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I fought when this thing wasn't giving me any money.</v>

2086
01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2087
01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>So just give,</v>

2088
01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:25.420
<v Speaker 1>let me lose the fight or two and get some money at the end of my career because</v>

2089
01:00:25.761 --> 01:00:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I deserve that.</v>

2090
01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:28.041
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't like,</v>

2091
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:29.960
<v Speaker 1>of course he was going there to win,</v>

2092
01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:35.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's like I want to take the risk because I was fighting in Japan getting on</v>

2093
01:00:35.551 --> 01:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>an old $5,000 and now that the game,</v>

2094
01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like bringing you so much money,</v>

2095
01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:42.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to retire.</v>

2096
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.333
<v Speaker 1>Let me just do</v>

2097
01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:44.321
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2098
01:00:44.321 --> 01:00:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Minataro not,</v>

2099
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:51.270
<v Speaker 2>not only was he a pioneer and one of the great MMA heavyweights of all time,</v>

2100
01:00:51.851 --> 01:00:55.870
<v Speaker 2>but he's so important for MMA because he showed that heavyweights can fight off</v>

2101
01:00:55.871 --> 01:00:58.840
<v Speaker 2>their back and then heavyweights can win by triangle.</v>

2102
01:00:58.841 --> 01:01:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Like when he triangled Mark Coleman and was tapping guys with arm bars when he</v>

2103
01:01:02.441 --> 01:01:03.660
<v Speaker 2>beat Bob Saget,</v>

2104
01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Bob Sapp on his fucking crazy that that is one of the greatest MMA fights in the</v>

2105
01:01:07.991 --> 01:01:08.950
<v Speaker 2>history of the sport.</v>

2106
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:13.630
<v Speaker 2>375 pound Bob Sapp Minataro only probably way two 30.</v>

2107
01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:15.460
<v Speaker 2>And he wound up tapping with an arm bar.</v>

2108
01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:16.650
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking crazy.</v>

2109
01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:18.580
<v Speaker 2>And after get spiked on his head,</v>

2110
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:20.980
<v Speaker 2>which still apparently fucks with him to his day,</v>

2111
01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:23.110
<v Speaker 2>his neck was fucked up permanent because of that.</v>

2112
01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2113
01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.333
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

2114
01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:28.180
<v Speaker 2>375 pound guy who doesn't even look like a human,</v>

2115
01:01:28.181 --> 01:01:28.870
<v Speaker 2>he looked like a,</v>

2116
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:29.710
<v Speaker 2>like a comic book,</v>

2117
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.910
<v Speaker 2>either smashes him on his head and metatarsal recovered.</v>

2118
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:36.500
<v Speaker 2>And I mean he was one of the toughest guys of all time,</v>

2119
01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.900
<v Speaker 2>but she was run by a truck when he wasn't in jail.</v>

2120
01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:40.960
<v Speaker 2>That's that scarring.</v>

2121
01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:43.190
<v Speaker 2>So it's run by crazy.</v>

2122
01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2123
01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:44.320
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

2124
01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's um,</v>

2125
01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:48.760
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the most important figures in the history of the sport.</v>

2126
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.290
<v Speaker 2>And then I think Fabrisio took it to another level cause for breezy over doom</v>

2127
01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:57.280
<v Speaker 2>probably has the best guard in the history of the sport is the history of the</v>

2128
01:01:57.281 --> 01:01:58.180
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight division.</v>

2129
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2130
01:01:58.571 --> 01:02:02.110
<v Speaker 2>when he caught fade or when he had him in his triangle and he had them locked up</v>

2131
01:02:02.111 --> 01:02:02.381
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

2132
01:02:02.381 --> 01:02:04.420
<v Speaker 2>you don't get away with that guy like you,</v>

2133
01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:06.130
<v Speaker 2>you might get out of some people's guard,</v>

2134
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:07.270
<v Speaker 2>not Fabrizio.</v>

2135
01:02:07.271 --> 01:02:08.890
<v Speaker 2>That motherfucker locks people up.</v>

2136
01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:10.361
<v Speaker 2>And I got to thinking,</v>

2137
01:02:10.361 --> 01:02:10.481
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2138
01:02:10.481 --> 01:02:11.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm here just because of</v>

2139
01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:14.770
<v Speaker 2>my respect for him.</v>

2140
01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:15.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2141
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.300
<v Speaker 2>when he reached out to me it was like,</v>

2142
01:02:16.301 --> 01:02:16.690
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2143
01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:21.240
<v Speaker 2>I'll get your friend on 100% thank you thing and now he is a great guy and</v>

2144
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:22.230
<v Speaker 2>that's what I will,</v>

2145
01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:23.850
<v Speaker 2>that's why I asked you if,</v>

2146
01:02:23.851 --> 01:02:24.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2147
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:28.590
<v Speaker 2>if you kind of feel threatened because when people get there in the fight,</v>

2148
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:30.450
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what it was going to happen.</v>

2149
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.690
<v Speaker 2>And when your goal over there to talk with one,</v>

2150
01:02:33.691 --> 01:02:35.410
<v Speaker 2>you can say a wrong thing at the wrong man.</v>

2151
01:02:35.411 --> 01:02:35.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2152
01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you can make mistakes.</v>

2153
01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2154
01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:38.700
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>

2155
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:41.760
<v Speaker 2>my intention is always to just to make them look good.</v>

2156
01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:42.870
<v Speaker 2>That's all I'm trying to do.</v>

2157
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:46.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to do is just get them to express themselves and,</v>

2158
01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:46.581
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2159
01:02:46.581 --> 01:02:46.890
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2160
01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:50.250
<v Speaker 2>and also put some emotion to how great their performance was.</v>

2161
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:50.850
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

2162
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:51.181

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2168
01:02:55.260 --> 01:03:00.000
<v Speaker 2>it's a strange combination of do they go watch you sometimes.</v>

2169
01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:00.451
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes.</v>

2176
01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:04.740
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2177
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:05.970
<v Speaker 2>for me now it's like,</v>

2178
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2179
01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to try this comment a theme.</v>

2180
01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:12.530
<v Speaker 2>And so you're getting up in Los Angeles and a traveling anywhere,</v>

2181
01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:12.651
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2182
01:03:12.651 --> 01:03:13.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2183
01:03:13.191 --> 01:03:13.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2184
01:03:13.381 --> 01:03:15.840
<v Speaker 2>I have a Gig on Rhode Island.</v>

2185
01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:16.853
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island.</v>

2186
01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:17.620
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

2187
01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:18.453
<v Speaker 2>Portuguese people?</v>

2188
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2189
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I have a Gig Dad.</v>

2190
01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:21.691
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2191
01:03:21.691 --> 01:03:25.890
<v Speaker 2>I did the Gotham comedy club lasts less than two weeks ago.</v>

2192
01:03:25.891 --> 01:03:27.190
<v Speaker 2>I had climbed the clubs,</v>

2193
01:03:27.191 --> 01:03:30.190
<v Speaker 2>so it's hard to get a lot of Brazilians and come to see you.</v>

2194
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:32.190
<v Speaker 2>They want you to speak Portuguese.</v>

2195
01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.570
<v Speaker 2>They do in,</v>

2196
01:03:33.571 --> 01:03:35.520
<v Speaker 2>some of them don't speak English.</v>

2197
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2198
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.110
<v Speaker 2>There's like always like two or three at the thought that was in Portuguese.</v>

2199
01:03:40.111 --> 01:03:42.120
<v Speaker 2>But that was so good to see you.</v>

2200
01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:43.143
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

2201
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.570
<v Speaker 2>everything is sad.</v>

2202
01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2203
01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:47.940
<v Speaker 2>So that happened.</v>

2204
01:03:47.941 --> 01:03:49.290
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

2205
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:54.430
<v Speaker 2>it's hard maybe because I have to build an audience here and it's gonna take</v>

2206
01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:55.974
<v Speaker 2>some time.</v>

2207
01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Do you do a podcast?</v>

2208
01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.081
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2209
01:03:58.081 --> 01:03:59.390
<v Speaker 2>You should write should.</v>

2210
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2211
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.593
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

2212
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

2213
01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:01.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a good,</v>

2214
01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:02.940
<v Speaker 2>I think every comedian,</v>

2215
01:04:02.941 --> 01:04:05.010
<v Speaker 2>like every comedian has an Instagram page.</v>

2216
01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Every comedian officers should have a podcast.</v>

2217
01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:08.850
<v Speaker 2>It's very simple to do.</v>

2218
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that we do that much in Brazil.</v>

2219
01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:11.873
<v Speaker 2>So Ah,</v>

2220
01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.670
<v Speaker 2>maybe it could be the pioneer of that to recast.</v>

2221
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:15.031
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2222
01:04:15.031 --> 01:04:16.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're the pioneer for standup.</v>

2223
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Youtube is something huge in Brazil.</v>

2224
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a great way to start because with all you need is a Webcam and you</v>

2225
01:04:22.951 --> 01:04:24.930
<v Speaker 2>can start your podcast just on youtube.</v>

2226
01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:26.521

01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:30.870
<v Speaker 2>my channel Youtube got like 2 million subscribers.</v>

2231
01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:34.620
<v Speaker 2>Like on Twitter I have 12 million people following.</v>

2232
01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:36.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot,</v>

2233
01:04:36.301 --> 01:04:36.540

01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:42.540
<v Speaker 2>I got like 1.5 million people.</v>

2237
01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:43.374
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

2238
01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.220
<v Speaker 2>people are very active in social media in Brazil.</v>

2239
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.980
<v Speaker 2>It is good.</v>

2240
01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:51.980
<v Speaker 2>It's something that is from our nature to connect with people in Brazil.</v>

2241
01:04:52.081 --> 01:04:54.180
<v Speaker 2>So that's why social media huge.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Any was a,</v>

2243
01:04:56.491 --> 01:04:59.220
<v Speaker 2>it was like an alternative for the traditional media.</v>

<v Speaker 2>New York Times magazine saying you're the most influential person on Twitter.</v>

2249

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.940
<v Speaker 1>I was surprised.</v>

2256
01:05:23.941 --> 01:05:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Monday I woke up and it was story on the New York Times saying that I was the</v>

<v Speaker 1>Peter was something huge in Brazil.</v>

2266
01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:50.580
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference between the way people use Twitter in Brazil and America?</v>

2267
01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:51.533
<v Speaker 1>Is there a difference?</v>

2268
01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:52.291
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2269
01:05:52.291 --> 01:05:53.400
<v Speaker 1>For for me,</v>

2270
01:05:53.401 --> 01:05:55.410
<v Speaker 1>I just use Twitter for jokes.</v>

2271
01:05:55.411 --> 01:05:57.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what I did for quite some time.</v>

2272
01:05:57.211 --> 01:06:02.211
<v Speaker 1>It was a Twitter lost a lot of his strength in Brazil because people like to</v>

2273
01:06:05.281 --> 01:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>connect members or salts.</v>

2274
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Facebook is huge and Instagram is huge.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So you have your family over there,</v>

2281
01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Someone is going to listen.</v>

2282
01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not like on Facebook that people follows you and then if he likes you,</v>

2283
01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.080
<v Speaker 1>your post is going to be like in the,</v>

2284

2285
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Twitter,</v>

2286
01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:35.100
<v Speaker 1>there's just something that is there.</v>

2287
01:06:35.101 --> 01:06:37.950
<v Speaker 1>So it lost a lot of power in Brazil.</v>

2288
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:41.940
<v Speaker 1>But one thing that is happening right now is our new president and we have a new</v>

2289
01:06:41.941 --> 01:06:45.930
<v Speaker 1>president now that is a right wing guy who was just a lacked and then he got</v>

2290

01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:52.350
<v Speaker 1>There was like two months ago during the process of the election,</v>

2294
01:06:52.351 --> 01:06:54.420
<v Speaker 1>holy shit got stabbed in the gut.</v>

2295
01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Like oh yeah,</v>

2296
01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:57.001
<v Speaker 1>you do see that.</v>

2297
01:06:57.001 --> 01:06:57.870
<v Speaker 1>And that was crazy.</v>

2298
01:06:57.871 --> 01:06:58.790
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hear about that.</v>

2299
01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:00.480
<v Speaker 1>And he is like a very white rain.</v>

2300
01:07:00.481 --> 01:07:05.481
<v Speaker 1>He warned the election and he is trying to do with Twitter with Trump did where</v>

2301
01:07:06.121 --> 01:07:10.710
<v Speaker 1>he's doing and here like run instead of going to press conferences and</v>

2302
01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:13.590
<v Speaker 1>everything who just go on Twitter and see what he wants.</v>

2303
01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:14.483
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2304
01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:14.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2305
01:07:14.861 --> 01:07:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Twitter is a unique in the way people just use it to insult people and still</v>

2306
01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:20.130
<v Speaker 2>angry.</v>

2307
01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:21.250
<v Speaker 2>It's so angry.</v>

2308
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Like if you just,</v>

2309
01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:27.720
<v Speaker 2>only if you didn't know anything about people and you just looked on Twitter and</v>

2310
01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:31.120
<v Speaker 2>just like saw how you like when people must be fighting in the streets,</v>

2311
01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.310
<v Speaker 2>it must be just a bloodbath out there.</v>

2312
01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:37.210
<v Speaker 2>If you really thought that people interacted in the real world the way they do</v>

2313
01:07:37.211 --> 01:07:38.044
<v Speaker 2>on Twitter,</v>

2314
01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:41.100
<v Speaker 2>you would think that everywhere is just weapons and clubs and picking shouldn't</v>

2315
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:44.410
<v Speaker 2>running people over with cars wishing everyone dies.</v>

2316
01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.310
<v Speaker 2>But I think man,</v>

2317
01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:49.150
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference and I think we have to acknowledge that there's a</v>

2318
01:07:49.151 --> 01:07:52.480
<v Speaker 2>difference between your behavior on the web and outside of them</v>

2319
01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:53.310
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2320
01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:55.060
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you don't realize that,</v>

2321
01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:56.830
<v Speaker 1>oh the ward is bothering,</v>

2322
01:07:56.831 --> 01:08:01.060
<v Speaker 1>everybody is sensitive and everything else if you go outside is not that much.</v>

2323
01:08:01.061 --> 01:08:01.640
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>

2324
01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:02.270
<v Speaker 1>The same.</v>

2325
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:03.080
<v Speaker 1>It was always,</v>

2326
01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:03.470
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

2327
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:06.980
<v Speaker 2>a distorted lens that you could see humans through.</v>

2328
01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not how people really are and it's also,</v>

2329
01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:12.650
<v Speaker 2>it's not a healthy way to communicate because you don't worry about what the</v>

2330
01:08:12.651 --> 01:08:14.510
<v Speaker 2>person thinks about what you're saying.</v>

2331
01:08:14.511 --> 01:08:18.710
<v Speaker 2>You're things that you don't necessarily even really mean because you're trying</v>

2332
01:08:18.711 --> 01:08:20.060
<v Speaker 2>to be inflammatory,</v>

2333
01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:21.520
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2334
01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.350
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] I mean that's a lot of it.</v>

2335
01:08:24.351 --> 01:08:25.940
<v Speaker 2>A lot of is just screaming,</v>

2336
01:08:25.941 --> 01:08:29.190
<v Speaker 2>screaming for attention and insulting people and,</v>

2337
01:08:29.191 --> 01:08:30.800
<v Speaker 2>and then you look at people's pages.</v>

2338
01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:32.390
<v Speaker 2>That's the most disturbing thing to me.</v>

2339
01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.040
<v Speaker 2>When someone say something Shitty to me,</v>

2340
01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:37.340
<v Speaker 2>I'll go to their page and I see they're just saying shitty things all day long.</v>

2341
01:08:37.341 --> 01:08:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Like kind of life is this man,</v>

2342
01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:40.970
<v Speaker 2>so fucking terrible life.</v>

2343
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:42.210
<v Speaker 1>What I'm doing right now,</v>

2344
01:08:42.211 --> 01:08:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I have this series that I'd want Instagram where I just,</v>

2347
01:08:52.861 --> 01:08:54.880
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny because it's,</v>

2348
01:08:55.050 --> 01:08:57.370
<v Speaker 1>it's funny to see who is actually,</v>

2349
01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:58.290
<v Speaker 1>who hates me.</v>

2350
01:08:59.040 --> 01:08:59.611
<v Speaker 1>Then a,</v>

2351
01:08:59.611 --> 01:09:00.440
<v Speaker 1>I called this,</v>

2352
01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:04.200
<v Speaker 1>the people who hates me and then I put work in road and then all his like his</v>

2353
01:09:04.201 --> 01:09:06.140
<v Speaker 1>face because stunned than they are.</v>

2354
01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:07.290
<v Speaker 1>It's enough for you to see,</v>

2355
01:09:07.291 --> 01:09:08.460
<v Speaker 1>oh that's fucking,</v>

2356
01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:11.640
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to take things too serious because if you take a look of their</v>

2357
01:09:11.641 --> 01:09:12.630
<v Speaker 1>lives it's,</v>

2358
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:15.150
<v Speaker 1>you can see why they are so mad.</v>

2359
01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2360
01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:16.171
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2361
01:09:16.171 --> 01:09:18.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that is a lot of angry and they'll,</v>

2362
01:09:18.271 --> 01:09:19.980
<v Speaker 1>most of them have private accounts.</v>

2363
01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't look at their pictures.</v>

2364
01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.433
<v Speaker 1>They're hiding,</v>

2365
01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>they're hiding who they are.</v>

2366
01:09:24.090 --> 01:09:25.640
<v Speaker 1>They just talk shit in the comments.</v>

2367
01:09:25.641 --> 01:09:26.640
<v Speaker 1>That should an bro.</v>

2368
01:09:26.730 --> 01:09:27.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2369
01:09:27.001 --> 01:09:27.840
<v Speaker 1>That's weak shit.</v>

2370
01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:29.670
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that shit.</v>

2371
01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:33.810
<v Speaker 1>So giving people a chance to like just real blind shots,</v>

2372
01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:35.403
<v Speaker 1>this crazy.</v>

2373
01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that that the being anonymous on the web,</v>

2374
01:09:37.441 --> 01:09:37.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a good,</v>

2375
01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:41.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing because it allows you to be free at the same time.</v>

2376
01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:45.960
<v Speaker 2>Whistle blowers for people like proporting crimes,</v>

2377
01:09:45.961 --> 01:09:46.441
<v Speaker 2>reporting,</v>

2378
01:09:46.441 --> 01:09:47.850
<v Speaker 2>corruption of course report,</v>

2379
01:09:47.851 --> 01:09:48.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2380
01:09:48.131 --> 01:09:48.601
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2381
01:09:48.601 --> 01:09:49.860
<v Speaker 2>For that it's critical.</v>

2382
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:50.601
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

2383
01:09:50.601 --> 01:09:51.110
<v Speaker 1>there is a,</v>

2384
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.943
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2385
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:54.620
<v Speaker 1>there is a way to do it and they'll expose yourself.</v>

2386
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:56.660
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time he creates that.</v>

2387
01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:57.081
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

2388
01:09:57.081 --> 01:09:57.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2389
01:09:57.381 --> 01:09:58.550
<v Speaker 1>it's the sign up for the new era,</v>

2390
01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

2391
01:09:59.170 --> 01:10:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Just a new thing that we all have to navigate.</v>

2392
01:10:01.570 --> 01:10:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Is it just a new thing?</v>

2393
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:06.330
<v Speaker 2>And it's like we were talking about earlier with social media being so recent in</v>

2394
01:10:06.331 --> 01:10:07.021
<v Speaker 2>human history,</v>

2395
01:10:07.021 --> 01:10:11.070
<v Speaker 2>there's never been anything where you could just talk to the whole world and do</v>

2396
01:10:11.071 --> 01:10:13.740
<v Speaker 2>it from your phone while you're sitting at a red light.</v>

2397
01:10:13.741 --> 01:10:14.640
<v Speaker 2>You could say something.</v>

2398
01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:16.200
<v Speaker 2>There's a story about this woman.</v>

2399
01:10:16.201 --> 01:10:16.631
<v Speaker 2>What was her name?</v>

2400
01:10:16.631 --> 01:10:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Justine Sacco was at the woman's name who said something racist.</v>

2401
01:10:20.701 --> 01:10:21.534
<v Speaker 2>I went to a plane.</v>

2402
01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:22.280

2405
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to Africa.</v>

2406
01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Hope I don't get aids.</v>

2407
01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:27.811
<v Speaker 2>Just kidding.</v>

2412
01:10:33.931 --> 01:10:34.681
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it was.</v>

2413
01:10:34.681 --> 01:10:34.951
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>

2414
01:10:34.951 --> 01:10:38.820
<v Speaker 2>she was on some sort of psych medication and uh,</v>

2415
01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:42.210
<v Speaker 2>something that affects your brain and drank too.</v>

2416
01:10:42.211 --> 01:10:43.400
<v Speaker 2>She had a couple of drinks,</v>

2417
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:48.430
<v Speaker 2>just thought she was being funny and then wakes up 16 hours later in Africa and</v>

2418
01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:49.470
<v Speaker 2>her life is over.</v>

2419
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:50.343

2420
01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:51.413
<v Speaker 2>Fucking crazy.</v>

2421
01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:56.280
<v Speaker 2>And it was just one of those days where there was like a slow news cycle and</v>

2422
01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.200
<v Speaker 2>people just jumped on that tweet.</v>

2423
01:10:58.201 --> 01:11:02.580
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about it too is that they don't want you to recover from something</v>

2424
01:11:02.581 --> 01:11:03.150
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2425
01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:04.170
<v Speaker 2>They want that's,</v>

2426
01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.940
<v Speaker 2>that's you for the rest of your life.</v>

2427
01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:06.803
<v Speaker 2>That's what I felt.</v>

2428
01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:07.921
<v Speaker 2>That's what I felt.</v>

2429
01:11:07.921 --> 01:11:08.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm the baby fucker.</v>

2430

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:11.183
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2433
01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:12.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2434
01:11:12.150 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>So everything that say right now is like,</v>

2435
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:14.650
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

2436
01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:17.730
<v Speaker 2>You like fucking babies and never fucked a baby.</v>

2437
01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:20.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they are attractive.</v>

2438
01:11:20.731 --> 01:11:23.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel attracted at all.</v>

2439
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:26.790
<v Speaker 2>Do you foresee a time ever where you will go back to Brazil?</v>

2440
01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:27.121
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2441
01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:27.661
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

2442
01:11:27.661 --> 01:11:32.220
<v Speaker 2>I do go back to what I mean go back to do standup and I uh,</v>

2443
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:38.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't see damn man the challenges here when the freedom that I think I have</v>

2444
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.990
<v Speaker 2>here and maybe I don't,</v>

2445
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:41.760
<v Speaker 2>maybe I will face this,</v>

2446
01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:42.121
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2447
01:11:42.121 --> 01:11:43.050
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing,</v>

2448
01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:45.730
<v Speaker 2>the same thing when I get famous or when I went,</v>

2449
01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:46.750
<v Speaker 2>when I get,</v>

2450
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:47.100
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2451
01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:47.281
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2452
01:11:47.281 --> 01:11:47.790
<v Speaker 2>you won't.</v>

2453
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:48.930
<v Speaker 2>It's way easier here.</v>

2454
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:49.833
<v Speaker 2>You from what?</v>

2455
01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:51.510
<v Speaker 2>From what you're explaining to me,</v>

2456
01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:55.800
<v Speaker 2>but look at Lou Louis or is a different case because it's not what he said on</v>

2457
01:11:55.801 --> 01:11:58.500
<v Speaker 2>stage and you know,</v>

2458
01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.393
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2459
01:11:59.550 --> 01:12:02.970
<v Speaker 2>he got you caught up in the wave of the me too movement too.</v>

2460
01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if this same exact instance happened in the past,</v>

2461
01:12:06.691 --> 01:12:07.351
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same thing.</v>

2462
01:12:07.351 --> 01:12:07.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2463
01:12:07.481 --> 01:12:08.670
<v Speaker 2>it was a bit of comparison.</v>

2464
01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:13.940
<v Speaker 2>But I got like Daniel Tosh did the rape joke and that was over in like,</v>

2465
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:15.390
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2466
01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:16.410
<v Speaker 2>And do you know what,</v>

2467
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:17.580
<v Speaker 2>what happened there with a joke?</v>

2468
01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:18.481
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2469
01:12:18.481 --> 01:12:18.931
<v Speaker 2>he was looking,</v>

2470
01:12:18.931 --> 01:12:20.400
<v Speaker 2>provides them with the audience or something.</v>

2471
01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.290
<v Speaker 2>He was improvising with the audience.</v>

2472
01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Here's the deal.</v>

2473
01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2474
01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.410
<v Speaker 2>he was at the laugh factory.</v>

2475
01:12:25.411 --> 01:12:26.790
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't supposed to be there.</v>

2476
01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:27.121
<v Speaker 2>Don,</v>

2477
01:12:27.121 --> 01:12:28.980
<v Speaker 2>my rera who is his friend,</v>

2478
01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:29.581
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

2479
01:12:29.581 --> 01:12:29.821
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2480
01:12:29.821 --> 01:12:32.010
<v Speaker 2>why don't you go up and do some standup because I don't have any materials.</v>

2481
01:12:32.011 --> 01:12:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Just go up and fuck around.</v>

2482
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Just sit.</v>

2483
01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.710
<v Speaker 2>They'll be happy to see you.</v>

2484
01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:34.921
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2485
01:12:34.921 --> 01:12:35.300
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2486
01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:36.133
<v Speaker 2>So he goes on stage.</v>

2487
01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:36.360
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2488
01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any material.</v>

2489
01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:38.131
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2490
01:12:38.131 --> 01:12:38.311
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2491
01:12:38.311 --> 01:12:39.330
<v Speaker 2>what do you guys want to talk about?</v>

2492
01:12:39.331 --> 01:12:41.850
<v Speaker 2>And some guy yells out rape and he goes,</v>

2493
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:42.140
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2494
01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:42.510
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2495
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:43.370
<v Speaker 2>What's funny about it?</v>

2496
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Like he's like making fun of the guy.</v>

2497
01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you talking about?</v>

2498
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:47.790
<v Speaker 2>What's funny about rape?</v>

2499
01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:48.271
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2500
01:12:48.271 --> 01:12:48.840
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing.</v>

2501
01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:49.460
<v Speaker 2>He goes like,</v>

2502
01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:49.540
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2503
01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:50.251
<v Speaker 2>what's funny about rip?</v>

2504
01:12:50.251 --> 01:12:51.240
<v Speaker 2>The humiliation,</v>

2505
01:12:51.241 --> 01:12:52.074
<v Speaker 2>the violence?</v>

2506
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:53.490
<v Speaker 2>And some woman yells out,</v>

2507
01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.410
<v Speaker 2>actually there's nothing funny about rape.</v>

2508
01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:56.513
<v Speaker 2>So he goes,</v>

2509
01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:57.810
<v Speaker 2>when are you finding five guys or,</v>

2510
01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:01.080
<v Speaker 2>so he's just feeling Daniel Tosh.</v>

2511
01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:05.880
<v Speaker 2>So it probably would have been just one of those moments in a live crowd filled</v>

2512
01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:06.601
<v Speaker 2>with drunk people.</v>

2513
01:13:06.601 --> 01:13:10.140
<v Speaker 2>But she wrote a blog about where she was the victim.</v>

2514
01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.260
<v Speaker 2>She wrote this huge blog about him calling for her to get raped,</v>

2515
01:13:13.261 --> 01:13:15.040
<v Speaker 2>which is not exactly what he did.</v>

2516
01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.680
<v Speaker 2>It's in the context of being heckled.</v>

2517
01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:23.700
<v Speaker 2>You understand what it is and he kind of had to have some sort of an apology for</v>

2518
01:13:23.731 --> 01:13:23.821
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2519
01:13:23.821 --> 01:13:27.930
<v Speaker 2>but then all these other people jumped in and then it became a moment where</v>

2520
01:13:27.931 --> 01:13:31.320
<v Speaker 2>people could show that they don't support rape or they don't support what we</v>

2521
01:13:31.321 --> 01:13:32.460
<v Speaker 2>call rape culture.</v>

2522
01:13:32.490 --> 01:13:33.570
<v Speaker 2>The usual has a platform.</v>

2523
01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:34.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2524
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:34.980
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2525
01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:35.820
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened.</v>

2526
01:13:35.970 --> 01:13:38.160
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happened with me as well.</v>

2527
01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.860
<v Speaker 2>People don't want to analyze context anymore.</v>

2528
01:13:40.890 --> 01:13:41.641
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2529
01:13:41.641 --> 01:13:43.620
<v Speaker 2>And we are very,</v>

2530
01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:44.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2531
01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.030
<v Speaker 2>we are available.</v>

2532
01:13:45.031 --> 01:13:45.570
<v Speaker 2>We will the,</v>

2533
01:13:45.570 --> 01:13:46.590
<v Speaker 2>we as Comedians,</v>

2534
01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:47.371
<v Speaker 2>we are talking,</v>

2535
01:13:47.371 --> 01:13:48.330
<v Speaker 2>we are ourselves.</v>

2536
01:13:48.331 --> 01:13:49.620
<v Speaker 2>We are not playing a character.</v>

2537
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:50.910
<v Speaker 2>So if you take,</v>

2538
01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.560
<v Speaker 2>if I take your jokes,</v>

2539
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:53.423
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

2540
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:55.310
<v Speaker 2>out of context from your special Netflix,</v>

2541
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:56.340
<v Speaker 2>I can get some,</v>

2542
01:13:56.341 --> 01:13:57.610
<v Speaker 2>some clicks if a boy,</v>

2543
01:13:57.611 --> 01:13:58.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2544
01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure if I wanted,</v>

2545
01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:03.840
<v Speaker 2>but I think people are getting tired of it and now they understand the process.</v>

2546
01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:05.880
<v Speaker 2>But what I felt was the beginning of that,</v>

2547
01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:10.050
<v Speaker 2>especially in your country where you don't have a long history of stand up.</v>

2548
01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2549
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:12.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I lost</v>

2550
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:14.220
<v Speaker 1>money and uh,</v>

2551
01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:16.210
<v Speaker 1>that's why I lost a lot of money.</v>

2552
01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.890
<v Speaker 1>You're the motherfucking Lenny Bruce or Brazil.</v>

2553
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2554
01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.033
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2555
01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:20.913
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2556
01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:24.280
<v Speaker 1>someone will give me the deck granted in a future,</v>

2557
01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:25.270
<v Speaker 1>but now,</v>

2558
01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.120
<v Speaker 1>now you want to be now off Ian America.</v>

2559
01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:28.441
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2560
01:14:28.441 --> 01:14:28.691
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2561
01:14:28.691 --> 01:14:28.821
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2562
01:14:28.821 --> 01:14:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

2563
01:14:29.681 --> 01:14:30.760
<v Speaker 1>but that's way,</v>

2564
01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:31.653
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2565
01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:32.070
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2566
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:35.830
<v Speaker 1>what people said to me in what I felt was that I was,</v>

2567
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:41.430
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people said I was using this freedom of speech argument to offend</v>

2568
01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:42.360
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2569
01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2570
01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:42.910
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

2571
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:46.120
<v Speaker 1>you hear that in America too and we've just not the case.</v>

2572
01:14:46.121 --> 01:14:50.800
<v Speaker 1>But then he's mad at off freedom of speech because we had a law in,</v>

2573
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:51.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2574
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:56.550
<v Speaker 1>in Brazil a long time ago where people are like trying to uh,</v>

2575
01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:58.660
<v Speaker 1>regulate,</v>

2576
01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2577
01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:00.970
<v Speaker 1>comments on the web.</v>

2578
01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2579
01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:05.230
<v Speaker 1>if I feel offended I can ask someone to delete that.</v>

2580
01:15:05.231 --> 01:15:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Sold the golf with the government was trying to regulate that and a,</v>

2581
01:15:09.531 --> 01:15:11.050
<v Speaker 1>and the law was approved.</v>

2582
01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:16.000
<v Speaker 1>So like after you wasn't approved but that the law was like changing after the</v>

2583
01:15:16.001 --> 01:15:16.834
<v Speaker 1>voting.</v>

2584
01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.350
<v Speaker 1>But when he becomes at the end,</v>

2585
01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:19.480
<v Speaker 1>the government was like,</v>

2586
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:21.490
<v Speaker 1>when he was getting the time with the voting,</v>

2587
01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:22.780
<v Speaker 1>the governor was like,</v>

2588
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:23.201
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2589
01:15:23.201 --> 01:15:24.400
<v Speaker 1>what about he fight?</v>

2590
01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Take some tweets as well.</v>

2591
01:15:26.591 --> 01:15:27.490
<v Speaker 1>That offend me.</v>

2592
01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:30.700
<v Speaker 1>So the government tried to get into the weight of things.</v>

2593
01:15:30.701 --> 01:15:32.260
<v Speaker 1>So it is a matter of freedom of speech.</v>

2594
01:15:32.290 --> 01:15:33.460
<v Speaker 1>When this is going to end,</v>

2595
01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:35.170
<v Speaker 1>it becomes with a joke,</v>

2596
01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:40.270
<v Speaker 1>but maybe can end with the government shutting you up.</v>

2597
01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2598
01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:42.760
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend in Venezuela,</v>

2599
01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.020
<v Speaker 1>a comedian friend.</v>

2600
01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:46.840
<v Speaker 1>His name is Nacho.</v>

2601
01:15:46.841 --> 01:15:47.530
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

2602
01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:49.900
<v Speaker 1>he was kicked out of the country because of some jokes he did.</v>

2603
01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2604
01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:51.101
<v Speaker 1>He's Ken.</v>

2605
01:15:51.101 --> 01:15:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Go back his living in Miami right now because he,</v>

2606
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.470
<v Speaker 1>if he goes back to Venezuela right now,</v>

2607
01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:58.720
<v Speaker 1>the government is going to pull Camille own jail.</v>

2608
01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.441
<v Speaker 1>Maybe kill him.</v>

2609
01:15:59.441 --> 01:16:00.274
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2610
01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:00.911
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2611
01:16:00.911 --> 01:16:01.890
<v Speaker 1>What was his jokes about?</v>

2612
01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:02.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2613
01:16:02.111 --> 01:16:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what his joke was about,</v>

2614
01:16:04.061 --> 01:16:05.500
<v Speaker 1>but he was making fun of the government.</v>

2615
01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:09.920
<v Speaker 1>But then like one year after that he makes some jokes about people with down</v>

2616
01:16:09.921 --> 01:16:12.790
<v Speaker 1>syndrome and then the golfer and felt that he,</v>

2617
01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:13.850
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>

2618
01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:16.900
<v Speaker 1>when he has to go to jail because of the Dow Syndrome,</v>

2619
01:16:16.901 --> 01:16:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2620
01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:21.730
<v Speaker 1>they were using that thing to take him out of the streets.</v>

2621
01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:23.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's Dasia result there,</v>

2622
01:16:23.981 --> 01:16:24.221
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2623
01:16:24.221 --> 01:16:26.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy to do comedy outside of America.</v>

2624
01:16:26.891 --> 01:16:28.210
<v Speaker 1>You built that freedom.</v>

2625
01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:28.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2626
01:16:28.851 --> 01:16:30.290
<v Speaker 2>You hear about it all the time.</v>

2627
01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:34.610
<v Speaker 2>People in other countries that say jokes and they get in trouble.</v>

2628
01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:35.493
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2629
01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:37.460
<v Speaker 2>like there was something in Thailand,</v>

2630
01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:38.301
<v Speaker 2>there was some,</v>

2631
01:16:38.301 --> 01:16:41.740
<v Speaker 2>someone made a joke about the king and they locked him in jail and it's,</v>

2632
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:42.980
<v Speaker 2>it's very danger.</v>

2633
01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Does a lot of countries where it's very dangerous,</v>

2634
01:16:45.591 --> 01:16:47.510
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous to speak out against the government.</v>

2635
01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:48.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2636
01:16:48.681 --> 01:16:48.921
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

2637
01:16:48.921 --> 01:16:49.731
<v Speaker 2>we're really,</v>

2638
01:16:49.731 --> 01:16:50.690
<v Speaker 2>really fortunate here.</v>

2639
01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.160
<v Speaker 2>So like for you,</v>

2640
01:16:52.161 --> 01:16:56.630
<v Speaker 2>when you see Americans complaining about freedom of speech over here and not,</v>

2641
01:16:56.930 --> 01:16:58.250
<v Speaker 2>not being able to say whatever you want,</v>

2642
01:16:58.251 --> 01:16:58.941
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a joke,</v>

2643
01:16:58.941 --> 01:16:59.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2644
01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:00.083
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2645
01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:01.670
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I feel.</v>

2646
01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:02.631
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

2647
01:17:02.631 --> 01:17:03.470
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be an asshole,</v>

2648
01:17:03.471 --> 01:17:04.790
<v Speaker 1>just deal with the consequences.</v>

2649
01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:06.243
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2650
01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:07.911
<v Speaker 1>That's what I feel.</v>

2651
01:17:07.911 --> 01:17:08.744
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hustle.</v>

2652
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:10.340
<v Speaker 1>But when someone stopped you on the street,</v>

2653
01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:11.420
<v Speaker 1>so you're a piece of shit,</v>

2654
01:17:11.421 --> 01:17:11.811
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2655
01:17:11.811 --> 01:17:12.644
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2656
01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:13.011
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2657
01:17:13.011 --> 01:17:13.880
<v Speaker 1>But that's okay.</v>

2658
01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:14.990
<v Speaker 1>That's end there.</v>

2659
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I am a piece of shit and that's where it has to and you know,</v>

2660
01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.020
<v Speaker 1>don't take it personal.</v>

2661
01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:22.601
<v Speaker 1>That's what I,</v>

2662
01:17:22.601 --> 01:17:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I feel that is,</v>

2663
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:28.220
<v Speaker 1>is difficult to do a comedy out there in here.</v>

2664
01:17:28.221 --> 01:17:30.830
<v Speaker 1>You have this freedom of doing it then I think is,</v>

2665
01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:32.053
<v Speaker 1>is beautiful.</v>

2666
01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:33.081
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

2667
01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:34.280
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you guys built.</v>

2668
01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that it's going to change in Brazil and then maybe the standup</v>

2669
01:17:38.481 --> 01:17:40.240
<v Speaker 1>comedy could actually see,</v>

2670
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:42.830
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that happened in America is that Lenny Bruce,</v>

2671
01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:45.620
<v Speaker 1>because he didn't just tell jokes,</v>

2672
01:17:45.621 --> 01:17:48.410
<v Speaker 1>he actually talked about social issues on stage.</v>

2673
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:52.430
<v Speaker 1>It actually expanded people's ideas of what these social issues are and how</v>

2674
01:17:52.431 --> 01:17:53.264
<v Speaker 1>critical they are.</v>

2675
01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:56.090
<v Speaker 1>It changed culture and a lot of ways and jokes.</v>

2676
01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:01.200
<v Speaker 1>One of the things about standup comedy that does help to change culture is safe.</v>

2677
01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:03.470
<v Speaker 1>You have an opinion and I have an opinion.</v>

2678
01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:05.780
<v Speaker 1>If your opinion is different than mine,</v>

2679
01:18:06.130 --> 01:18:06.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2680
01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.550
<v Speaker 1>you say something,</v>

2681
01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:07.821
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2682
01:18:07.821 --> 01:18:08.750
<v Speaker 1>well I don't agree with that.</v>

2683
01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:09.584
<v Speaker 1>I think this,</v>

2684
01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.860
<v Speaker 1>but if you say something and you make me laugh,</v>

2685
01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.450
<v Speaker 1>even if I don't agree with it,</v>

2686
01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.970
<v Speaker 1>it sneaks in my head like you have a point.</v>

2687
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:19.820
<v Speaker 1>If your point is so good that it makes me laugh,</v>

2688
01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:21.080
<v Speaker 1>even if I don't agree with it,</v>

2689
01:18:21.081 --> 01:18:21.980
<v Speaker 1>like God damn it,</v>

2690
01:18:21.981 --> 01:18:22.814
<v Speaker 1>he got it.</v>

2691
01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:23.893
<v Speaker 1>He got in there.</v>

2692
01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:24.651
<v Speaker 1>So you get,</v>

2693
01:18:24.651 --> 01:18:28.400
<v Speaker 1>you can propagate ideas inside someone's consciousness.</v>

2694
01:18:28.401 --> 01:18:28.730
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

2695
01:18:28.730 --> 01:18:29.780
<v Speaker 1>you could sneak them in.</v>

2696
01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.690
<v Speaker 1>We have a few people doing it in Brazil.</v>

2697
01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

2698
01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:33.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2699
01:18:33.610 --> 01:18:33.950
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

2700
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I used to have this TV show called CQC and we used to do comedy in Congress.</v>

2701
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:41.990
<v Speaker 1>We used to go in interview congressmen and make fun of them.</v>

2702
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.801
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2703
01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:42.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2704
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:45.860
<v Speaker 1>we got kicked out of the congress anyway again.</v>

2705
01:18:45.861 --> 01:18:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Then people brought,</v>

2706
01:18:46.770 --> 01:18:48.590
<v Speaker 1>brought us back to the congress.</v>

2707
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:50.210
<v Speaker 1>But he all,</v>

2708
01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:55.480
<v Speaker 1>you all reached a point when it's about money and if the end,</v>

2709
01:18:56.211 --> 01:18:59.000
<v Speaker 1>if someone is not willing to put money in your product,</v>

2710
01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:03.680
<v Speaker 1>you don't do it in money is connected to politics and politics and brands and</v>

2711
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:05.510
<v Speaker 1>the TV stations.</v>

2712
01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:07.820
<v Speaker 1>For you to have a TV station in Brazil,</v>

2713
01:19:07.821 --> 01:19:09.710
<v Speaker 1>you need a authorization by the government.</v>

2714
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:15.140
<v Speaker 1>So you're not death completely free to do what you want to do it.</v>

2715
01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:16.640
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2716
01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:20.810
<v Speaker 1>but you have some people doing it and comedy's getting is getting big.</v>

2717

2768
01:20:35.370 --> 01:20:37.680
<v Speaker 2>I probably have all of them watching this right now.</v>

2769
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:42.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anyone who has ever done it in one language and then made it over</v>

2770
01:20:43.411 --> 01:20:44.610
<v Speaker 2>in America afterwards.</v>

2771
01:20:44.611 --> 01:20:45.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think.</v>

2772
01:20:46.410 --> 01:20:47.550
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of any,</v>

2773
01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:49.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody in English.</v>

2774
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2775
01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:50.363
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

2776
01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2777
01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:55.350
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of anybody that started out in another country and then made it an</v>

2778
01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:55.800
<v Speaker 2>American.</v>

2779
01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.480
<v Speaker 2>What is the name of the Russian guy?</v>

2780
01:20:57.481 --> 01:20:59.730
<v Speaker 2>They always do the [inaudible] still doing the comedy store.</v>

2781
01:20:59.731 --> 01:21:01.350
<v Speaker 2>They used to say Yaakov.</v>

2782
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.990
<v Speaker 2>SMIRNOFF.</v>

2783
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2784
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Great Guy.</v>

2785
01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:03.870
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2786
01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:05.190
<v Speaker 2>I think he's Russian.</v>

2787
01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:05.791
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2788
01:21:05.791 --> 01:21:06.541
<v Speaker 2>he's rushing,</v>

2789
01:21:06.541 --> 01:21:08.670
<v Speaker 2>but I think he's been over here most of his life.</v>

2790
01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2791
01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:11.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he started in Russia.</v>

2792
01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.350
<v Speaker 2>I think his whole idea in Russia,</v>

2793
01:21:13.351 --> 01:21:13.951
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

2794
01:21:13.951 --> 01:21:14.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2795
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.001
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing.</v>

2796
01:21:15.001 --> 01:21:15.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2797
01:21:15.181 --> 01:21:16.740
<v Speaker 2>So he was doing like a character?</v>

2798
01:21:16.770 --> 01:21:16.941
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2799
01:21:16.941 --> 01:21:17.001
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2800
01:21:17.001 --> 01:21:17.130
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2801
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:17.791
<v Speaker 2>He speaks,</v>

2802
01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:18.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2803
01:21:18.001 --> 01:21:19.470
<v Speaker 2>he definitely speaks Russian.</v>

2804
01:21:19.471 --> 01:21:19.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2805
01:21:19.890 --> 01:21:21.870
<v Speaker 2>And he definitely is from Russia,</v>

2806
01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:22.740
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2807
01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:24.330
<v Speaker 2>he definitely plays it up too.</v>

2808
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:25.380
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

2809
01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:25.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2810
01:21:25.591 --> 01:21:26.401
<v Speaker 2>he's been over here forever.</v>

2811
01:21:26.401 --> 01:21:31.401
<v Speaker 2>He has his own theater in what does that place where those old folks live?</v>

2812
01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:32.400
<v Speaker 2>Branson,</v>

2813
01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:32.821
<v Speaker 2>Branson,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2816
01:21:33.991 --> 01:21:35.130
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of those weird,</v>

2817
01:21:35.131 --> 01:21:36.990
<v Speaker 2>like super religious places.</v>

2818
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2819
01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:38.093
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2820
01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:40.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a strange area.</v>

2821
01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:42.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a star.</v>

2822
01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Very strange.</v>

2823
01:21:43.081 --> 01:21:43.914
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2824
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:46.590
<v Speaker 2>like you talk to people about it and Branson,</v>

2825
01:21:46.591 --> 01:21:47.341
<v Speaker 2>Missouri and people go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2827
01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:48.751
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2828
01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:50.940
<v Speaker 2>it's not a place where like Dave Chappelle goes to play.</v>

2829
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Do you go through those places?</v>

2830
01:21:52.381 --> 01:21:52.591
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2831
01:21:52.591 --> 01:21:53.424
<v Speaker 2>I do not.</v>

2832
01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:53.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2833
01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:54.660
<v Speaker 2>I do not.</v>

2834
01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.310
<v Speaker 2>There's only so many places I go,</v>

2835
01:21:56.610 --> 01:21:57.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any time to,</v>

2836
01:21:57.841 --> 01:21:58.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>

2837
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2838
01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to run uphill.</v>

2839
01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:01.253
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2840
01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:02.460
<v Speaker 2>If you don't get it.</v>

2841
01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

2842
01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:03.270
<v Speaker 2>that's all right.</v>

2843
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:04.230
<v Speaker 2>I'll go to Chicago.</v>

2844
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:04.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2845
01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:05.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2846
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:07.100
<v Speaker 2>I'll go somewhere where people can get to it.</v>

2847
01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:07.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2848
01:22:07.591 --> 01:22:08.424
<v Speaker 2>This just,</v>

2849
01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:09.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't have time or not.</v>

2850
01:22:09.421 --> 01:22:11.250
<v Speaker 2>What I'd concentrate on now.</v>

2851
01:22:11.251 --> 01:22:11.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2852
01:22:11.670 --> 01:22:13.680
<v Speaker 2>the ground's already been broken.</v>

2853
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:14.221
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2854
01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:15.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm not breaking any new ground.</v>

2855
01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:17.190
<v Speaker 2>All I'm trying to do is write good stuff.</v>

2856
01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:17.821
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and I'm just trying to make people happy.</v>

2860
01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make them laugh.</v>

2861
01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:22.890
<v Speaker 2>That's all I'm trying to do.</v>

2862
01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:23.700
<v Speaker 2>I just try to,</v>

2863
01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:26.940
<v Speaker 2>when they go and they get a babysitter and they come to a comedy club,</v>

2864
01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I want to do my best.</v>

2865
01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.700
<v Speaker 2>That's all I want to do.</v>

2866
01:22:29.701 --> 01:22:30.960
<v Speaker 2>So that's all I think about.</v>

2867
01:22:31.230 --> 01:22:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you still have a gavel?</v>

2868
01:22:33.301 --> 01:22:36.930
<v Speaker 2>A lot of like movie offers and I get offers for stuff,</v>

2869
01:22:36.931 --> 01:22:37.764
<v Speaker 2>but I don't act.</v>

2870
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it anymore.</v>

2871
01:22:39.210 --> 01:22:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I tried it a little bit.</v>

2872
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.370
<v Speaker 2>It's just not my thing.</v>

2873
01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:43.080
<v Speaker 2>It just takes time.</v>

2874
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:44.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessary.</v>

2875
01:22:44.131 --> 01:22:45.330
<v Speaker 2>And all my friends that do it,</v>

2876
01:22:45.331 --> 01:22:45.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2877
01:22:45.481 --> 01:22:48.000
<v Speaker 2>like my friend Brian just call me from a movie set the other day.</v>

2878
01:22:48.001 --> 01:22:48.660
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2879
01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:48.931
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

2880
01:22:48.931 --> 01:22:49.561
<v Speaker 2>you're so right.</v>

2881
01:22:49.561 --> 01:22:50.394
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this.</v>

2882
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.761
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2883
01:22:50.761 --> 01:22:52.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting in my trailer for 16 hours.</v>

2884
01:22:52.630 --> 01:22:52.921
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2885
01:22:52.921 --> 01:22:54.120
<v Speaker 2>I fucking hate this shit.</v>

2886
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:55.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do this.</v>

2887
01:22:55.411 --> 01:22:57.840
<v Speaker 2>I just got another offer for another movie that's not that good.</v>

2888
01:22:57.841 --> 01:22:58.950
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want to do that either.</v>

2889
01:22:59.570 --> 01:22:59.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2890
01:22:59.790 --> 01:23:00.121
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

2891
01:23:00.121 --> 01:23:04.260
<v Speaker 2>you could do a movie and put so much effort and time and do it and no one will</v>

2892
01:23:04.261 --> 01:23:04.960
<v Speaker 2>see it.</v>

2893
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe it'll be opposite some fucking big Avengers movie and nobody goes to</v>

2894
01:23:08.411 --> 01:23:08.921
<v Speaker 2>see your movie.</v>

2895
01:23:08.921 --> 01:23:11.080
<v Speaker 2>And it's out of the movie theater and you're like,</v>

2896
01:23:11.081 --> 01:23:11.830
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2897
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:13.410
<v Speaker 2>I spent so much time doing that.</v>

2898
01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.111
<v Speaker 2>No one cares.</v>

2899
01:23:14.111 --> 01:23:14.830
<v Speaker 2>No one cares.</v>

2900
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:15.790
<v Speaker 2>The thing about movies too,</v>

2901
01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:18.130
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting is there so many of them.</v>

2902
01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're ever going to see all the movies.</v>

2903
01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.890
<v Speaker 2>There's so many movies and every week there's new movies.</v>

2904
01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.500
<v Speaker 2>If you really stop and think about how fucking insane that is,</v>

2905
01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:30.070
<v Speaker 2>there must be thousands and thousands and thousands of movies.</v>

2906
01:23:30.370 --> 01:23:31.930
<v Speaker 2>You can't possibly see the mall.</v>

2907
01:23:32.170 --> 01:23:33.820
<v Speaker 2>Like if you just want to be entertained,</v>

2908
01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:36.520
<v Speaker 2>like you could see movies to the end of time.</v>

2909
01:23:36.521 --> 01:23:39.760
<v Speaker 2>You could just sit in front of your fucking Netflix and just to your eyes fall</v>

2910
01:23:39.761 --> 01:23:41.080
<v Speaker 2>out of your head watching movies.</v>

2911
01:23:41.081 --> 01:23:41.710
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2912
01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:43.930
<v Speaker 2>It's almost no need to make more movies were good,</v>

2913
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.410
<v Speaker 2>painless,</v>

2914
01:23:44.410 --> 01:23:44.990
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

2915
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2916
01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:48.400
<v Speaker 2>and it's crazy because movies are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and</v>

2917
01:23:48.401 --> 01:23:52.690
<v Speaker 2>bigger because they have to bring you something that takes you out of your</v>

2918
01:23:52.691 --> 01:23:53.524
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

2919
01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:57.790
<v Speaker 2>People don't go to the movie to watch Adam Sandler anymore.</v>

2920
01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Then you want a fucking superhero kicking your face in communion or neck.</v>

2921
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:02.343
<v Speaker 2>That's what they want.</v>

2922
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:04.480
<v Speaker 2>They won't fucking huge stuff.</v>

2923
01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2924
01:24:05.050 --> 01:24:05.561
<v Speaker 2>there's that.</v>

2925
01:24:05.561 --> 01:24:08.860
<v Speaker 2>But then people do need comedies like Kevin Hart movies.</v>

2926
01:24:08.861 --> 01:24:10.300
<v Speaker 2>They still sell really well.</v>

2927
01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Like people still want to see something funny,</v>

2928
01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:12.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2929
01:24:12.971 --> 01:24:13.630
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2930
01:24:13.630 --> 01:24:14.620
<v Speaker 2>people still need,</v>

2931
01:24:14.710 --> 01:24:17.710
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things about standup and one of the things about funny movies</v>

2932
01:24:17.711 --> 01:24:20.860
<v Speaker 2>too is that people need a break from the grind of life.</v>

2933
01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Life is a horrible grind,</v>

2934
01:24:23.230 --> 01:24:23.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2935
01:24:23.441 --> 01:24:24.910
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking hard man.</v>

2936
01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:29.350
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to pay your bills and get up every morning to a job you don't want to</v>

2937
01:24:29.351 --> 01:24:32.230
<v Speaker 2>get up to and maybe not even into being married anymore.</v>

2938
01:24:32.230 --> 01:24:34.150
<v Speaker 2>And you've got to fucking trudge through that.</v>

2939
01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Cause maybe you have a children and you decided that it's better to stay for</v>

2940
01:24:37.991 --> 01:24:41.900
<v Speaker 2>your children and you're fucking living in hell and your neighbors are current</v>

2941
01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:44.260
<v Speaker 2>and the dog won't stop barking and,</v>

2942
01:24:44.290 --> 01:24:45.490
<v Speaker 2>and then you just need something.</v>

2943
01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Just something to give me something.</v>

2944
01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:47.560
<v Speaker 2>Give me something funny,</v>

2945
01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:47.951
<v Speaker 2>my friend.</v>

2946
01:24:47.951 --> 01:24:50.700
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm so optimistic in life is like what,</v>

2947
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:53.890
<v Speaker 2>what a chance I have of pursuing my dream.</v>

2948
01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2949
01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:58.300
<v Speaker 2>And doing comedy and making people laugh and having fun.</v>

2950
01:24:58.301 --> 01:25:03.301
<v Speaker 2>And I'll have to sit in a fucking fucking share for eight hours a day and a new</v>

2951
01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:04.710
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

2952
01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:05.560
<v Speaker 2>a job that I like.</v>

2953
01:25:05.561 --> 01:25:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Because if you like to be an accountant,</v>

2954
01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.133
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>

2955
01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2956
01:25:08.710 --> 01:25:10.480
<v Speaker 2>Be happy being an accountant.</v>

2957
01:25:10.481 --> 01:25:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2958
01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.620
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2959
01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:13.270
<v Speaker 2>he w he was never for me.</v>

2960
01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2961
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:14.703
<v Speaker 2>It was never for me.</v>

2962
01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:15.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2963
01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:17.410
<v Speaker 2>it was never for me either or any comedian that I know,</v>

2964
01:25:17.411 --> 01:25:20.830
<v Speaker 2>everyone that I know was like doing something and living in hell until they</v>

2965
01:25:20.831 --> 01:25:24.460
<v Speaker 2>decided to be a comedian or the thought of doing something else.</v>

2966
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:25.361
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2967
01:25:25.361 --> 01:25:26.080
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2968
01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.400
<v Speaker 2>that's the path of life,</v>

2969
01:25:27.401 --> 01:25:27.671
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2970
01:25:27.671 --> 01:25:28.840
<v Speaker 2>The path of life is,</v>

2971
01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:31.060
<v Speaker 2>for some people what we do would be hell.</v>

2972
01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:31.691
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2973
01:25:31.691 --> 01:25:36.190
<v Speaker 2>for some people that are introverts or that they don't like attention or they</v>

2974
01:25:36.191 --> 01:25:37.960
<v Speaker 2>don't like public speaking and they don't,</v>

2975
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:39.700
<v Speaker 2>they're not necessarily funny.</v>

2976
01:25:40.090 --> 01:25:41.200
<v Speaker 2>What we do as hell.</v>

2977
01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:43.210
<v Speaker 2>If you're wearing a funny person,</v>

2978
01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.450
<v Speaker 2>you don't know how to make people laugh and you have to go on stage and make</v>

2979
01:25:46.451 --> 01:25:47.560
<v Speaker 2>people laugh every night.</v>

2980
01:25:47.561 --> 01:25:51.880
<v Speaker 2>That's your job and you have to try hard or there's some sort of pain involved.</v>

2981
01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:53.103
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

2982
01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.110
<v Speaker 2>that'd be hell.</v>

2983
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:54.500
<v Speaker 2>Did you see?</v>

2984
01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:54.970
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

2985
01:25:54.970 --> 01:25:55.661
<v Speaker 2>that was me.</v>

2986
01:25:55.661 --> 01:25:57.410
<v Speaker 2>The last few shows that I did in Brazil,</v>

2987
01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.380
<v Speaker 2>I felt I felt heavy,</v>

2988
01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.190
<v Speaker 2>heavy.</v>

2989
01:26:00.190 --> 01:26:01.510
<v Speaker 2>If everyone's watching you,</v>

2990
01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:02.081
<v Speaker 2>I fell.</v>

2991
01:26:02.081 --> 01:26:03.710
<v Speaker 2>I fell that the energy,</v>

2992
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.300
<v Speaker 1>I still have very lawyer artists and I'm fine law.</v>

2993
01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:09.980
<v Speaker 1>They love me and I love them.</v>

2994
01:26:09.981 --> 01:26:11.180
<v Speaker 1>We still have that connection,</v>

2995
01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:13.940
<v Speaker 1>but I felt exposed,</v>

2996
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:16.280
<v Speaker 1>not exposed and that's when you,</v>

2997
01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:18.230
<v Speaker 1>this is after the baby fuck Joe.</v>

2998
01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2999
01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:21.080
<v Speaker 1>If after me becoming a baby fucker,</v>

3000
01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:24.471
<v Speaker 1>but at the time,</v>

3001
01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:25.071
<v Speaker 1>that was funny.</v>

3002
01:26:25.071 --> 01:26:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Right when you said it.</v>

3003
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Everybody laughed.</v>

3004
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:27.470
<v Speaker 1>They laugh a lot.</v>

3005
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3006
01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.030
<v Speaker 1>That was not the case.</v>

3007
01:26:29.031 --> 01:26:33.440
<v Speaker 1>My funny to take this joke out of context and put it in the newspaper,</v>

3008
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:34.551
<v Speaker 1>even me,</v>

3009
01:26:34.551 --> 01:26:35.271
<v Speaker 1>when I read that,</v>

3010
01:26:35.271 --> 01:26:35.721
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3011
01:26:35.721 --> 01:26:38.360
<v Speaker 1>this guy is fucking smashed up.</v>

3012
01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:41.870
<v Speaker 1>The rape joke that I did when I ran on a newspaper,</v>

3013
01:26:41.871 --> 01:26:42.890
<v Speaker 1>that was the rape joke.</v>

3014
01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:43.731
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>

3015
01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:44.960
<v Speaker 1>do you really want me to go that?</v>

3016
01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:47.020
<v Speaker 1>We referenced it 20 times.</v>

3017
01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:47.811
<v Speaker 1>He was bad.</v>

3018
01:26:47.811 --> 01:26:49.170
<v Speaker 1>He was something like a,</v>

3019
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I was watching on TV and I don't,</v>

3020
01:26:53.481 --> 01:26:54.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not proud of that.</v>

3021
01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:54.531
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3022
01:26:54.531 --> 01:26:55.850
<v Speaker 1>But I was watching on TV,</v>

3023
01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:59.200
<v Speaker 1>this woman then she was saying that she was raped and uh,</v>

3024
01:26:59.510 --> 01:27:00.111
<v Speaker 1>it was bad.</v>

3025
01:27:00.111 --> 01:27:01.400
<v Speaker 1>It was a very bad experience.</v>

3026
01:27:01.401 --> 01:27:01.491
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3027
01:27:01.491 --> 01:27:02.850
<v Speaker 1>she was crying but the camera was,</v>

3028
01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:04.190
<v Speaker 1>wasn't showing her face.</v>

3029
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:05.840
<v Speaker 1>It was just showing her mouth.</v>

3030
01:27:06.170 --> 01:27:08.210
<v Speaker 1>And she has a huge mustache,</v>

3031
01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:10.120
<v Speaker 1>like a huge mustache,</v>

3032
01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.630
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking lot of hair.</v>

3033
01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:13.410
<v Speaker 1>And I made this joke a ball.</v>

3034
01:27:13.450 --> 01:27:14.283
<v Speaker 1>Well this guy,</v>

3035
01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:14.870
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't,</v>

3036
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:15.680
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't,</v>

3037
01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:16.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3038
01:27:16.150 --> 01:27:16.983
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>

3039
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:19.120
<v Speaker 1>this was kind of a gift because she didn't,</v>

3040
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:21.380
<v Speaker 1>she wouldn't have another opportunity or something.</v>

3041
01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:21.681
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

3042
01:27:21.681 --> 01:27:22.514
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't good.</v>

3043
01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:23.750
<v Speaker 1>But I did once,</v>

3044
01:27:23.751 --> 01:27:28.751
<v Speaker 1>I was just testing the joke I was doing at one o'clock at night in my comedy</v>

3045
01:27:29.691 --> 01:27:30.140
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>

3046
01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:31.880
<v Speaker 1>It was like 20 people in the audience.</v>

3047
01:27:31.881 --> 01:27:32.780
<v Speaker 1>So you're just fucking around.</v>

3048
01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I was just fucking around there.</v>

3049
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3050
01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.050
<v Speaker 1>it was what I saw on TV.</v>

3051
01:27:36.051 --> 01:27:38.090
<v Speaker 1>So they were waiting for you to do something like that.</v>

3052
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:39.740
<v Speaker 1>And it was like this journalist was,</v>

3053
01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:44.570
<v Speaker 1>was there and he was doing a story for the rolling stone and I was doing,</v>

3054
01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:47.240
<v Speaker 1>it was a story about me and then the cover,</v>

3055
01:27:47.241 --> 01:27:48.110
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't in the cover,</v>

3056
01:27:48.111 --> 01:27:48.391
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

3057
01:27:48.391 --> 01:27:48.491
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3058
01:27:48.491 --> 01:27:51.740
<v Speaker 1>the picture on the cornerstone was me dressed as Jesus,</v>

3059
01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:55.190
<v Speaker 1>like bleeding with a crown in all my head.</v>

3060
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:56.870
<v Speaker 1>And that was the,</v>

3061
01:27:57.070 --> 01:27:57.440
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

3062
01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.170
<v Speaker 1>in the text was this rape joke.</v>

3063
01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:01.063
<v Speaker 1>It was draped joke.</v>

3064
01:28:01.190 --> 01:28:01.971
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even ride.</v>

3065
01:28:01.971 --> 01:28:03.870
<v Speaker 1>The thing was just like talking with Yardi,</v>

3066
01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:05.420
<v Speaker 1>but when that's,</v>

3067
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:07.070
<v Speaker 1>that was taken out of context,</v>

3068
01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:09.020
<v Speaker 1>he was hard for me to explain to them,</v>

3069
01:28:09.021 --> 01:28:09.740
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3070
01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:12.590
<v Speaker 1>this is was me fucking around with like 20 people.</v>

3071
01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:18.180
<v Speaker 1>The people couldn't see the difference between me doing any,</v>

3072
01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:19.380
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a good yoga at all.</v>

3073
01:28:19.410 --> 01:28:20.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not as something that I'm proud of,</v>

3074
01:28:20.841 --> 01:28:24.140
<v Speaker 1>but when you're on a stage on your test and some thanks,</v>

3075
01:28:24.141 --> 01:28:25.340
<v Speaker 1>just shit comes up.</v>

3076
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.160
<v Speaker 1>And I was testing boundaries as well.</v>

3077
01:28:28.161 --> 01:28:30.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it was my duty to test some stuff.</v>

3078
01:28:31.330 --> 01:28:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3079
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:35.330
<v Speaker 1>there's things that you say where you're not thinking them out because your ad</v>

3080
01:28:35.331 --> 01:28:38.480
<v Speaker 1>living in the moment and they come out and even you disagree with them as you're</v>

3081
01:28:38.481 --> 01:28:39.314
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

3082
01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:42.140
<v Speaker 1>But this is part of the process of creating material,</v>

3083
01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.330
<v Speaker 1>especially if there's 20 people in the crowd.</v>

3084
01:28:44.331 --> 01:28:45.164
<v Speaker 1>It's late at night.</v>

3085
01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Like what you do things just to see,</v>

3086
01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:48.770
<v Speaker 1>you go down doors,</v>

3087
01:28:48.771 --> 01:28:49.820
<v Speaker 1>you open doors,</v>

3088
01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:53.510
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what's in there and sometimes you'll say something and then</v>

3089
01:28:53.511 --> 01:28:57.050
<v Speaker 1>you'll have the fucking perfect line and it comes out of nowhere.</v>

3090
01:28:57.170 --> 01:28:59.960
<v Speaker 1>And the only way you find out is if you take a chance doing it.</v>

3091
01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3092
01:29:00.810 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think it's</v>

3093
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:02.791
<v Speaker 2>so fair.</v>

3094
01:29:02.791 --> 01:29:07.791
<v Speaker 2>And I was having a discussion with two great big comedians about the Louis sad</v>

3095
01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:11.940
<v Speaker 2>that he did recently.</v>

3096
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.550
<v Speaker 2>And I think you already talked about this,</v>

3097
01:29:14.551 --> 01:29:15.384
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3098
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:17.760
<v Speaker 2>the guy was testing stuff.</v>

3099
01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3100
01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:21.360
<v Speaker 2>So how can you judge if the work is not done?</v>

3101
01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:22.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not even close to done.</v>

3102
01:29:22.621 --> 01:29:22.981
<v Speaker 2>He probably,</v>

3103
01:29:22.981 --> 01:29:25.890
<v Speaker 2>maybe it did that bit once before if that,</v>

3104
01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:26.280
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3105
01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.420
<v Speaker 2>And the judgment was like,</v>

3106
01:29:27.450 --> 01:29:30.000
<v Speaker 2>oh he has to address what happened when him,</v>

3107
01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure he'll wheel but not on that sat.</v>

3108
01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he didn't address on that set that not his special.</v>

3109
01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:37.200
<v Speaker 2>When he has her special,</v>

3110
01:29:37.201 --> 01:29:39.090
<v Speaker 2>that's when he framed the thing,</v>

3111
01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.160
<v Speaker 2>okay that's my work.</v>

3112
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:43.200
<v Speaker 2>But if he's just testing stuff,</v>

3113
01:29:43.201 --> 01:29:44.700
<v Speaker 2>you cannot judge by that.</v>

3114
01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:48.330
<v Speaker 2>The problem is now everybody wants to judge everything he does and they want to</v>

3115
01:29:48.331 --> 01:29:49.650
<v Speaker 2>find him and watch him.</v>

3116
01:29:49.651 --> 01:29:54.120
<v Speaker 2>And so now he has to institute this a cell phone policy and all the comedy clubs</v>

3117
01:29:54.121 --> 01:29:54.600
<v Speaker 2>he works out.</v>

3118
01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:58.080
<v Speaker 2>We have to take your phone and put it in a bag so that no one can get ahold of</v>

3119
01:29:58.081 --> 01:29:58.321
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3120
01:29:58.321 --> 01:29:58.981
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>

3121
01:29:58.981 --> 01:29:59.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a real problem.</v>

3122
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:01.440
<v Speaker 2>He's got a real problem.</v>

3123
01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:05.850
<v Speaker 2>And it's also a real problem for creating comedy because if people don't</v>

3124
01:30:05.851 --> 01:30:08.580
<v Speaker 2>understand that this is what comedy is about,</v>

3125
01:30:08.581 --> 01:30:13.581
<v Speaker 2>that comedy is about improvisation and then boiling it down to what's good and</v>

3126
01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:17.070
<v Speaker 2>then figuring out what's the best way to express an idea.</v>

3127
01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Cause sometimes you have an idea and you'd know there's something there,</v>

3128
01:30:19.921 --> 01:30:20.970
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know how to say it.</v>

3129
01:30:20.971 --> 01:30:21.691
<v Speaker 2>So you just check,</v>

3130
01:30:21.691 --> 01:30:23.580
<v Speaker 2>take a chance on one way and then you go,</v>

3131
01:30:23.581 --> 01:30:23.890
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3132
01:30:23.890 --> 01:30:24.960
<v Speaker 2>that's the offensive.</v>

3133
01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:25.794
<v Speaker 2>That's disgusting.</v>

3134
01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:27.360
<v Speaker 2>But there's gotta be a way to do it.</v>

3135
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Let me find a better way to do.</v>

3136
01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

3137
01:30:29.670 --> 01:30:29.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3138
01:30:29.821 --> 01:30:31.530
<v Speaker 2>there's many bits that I did.</v>

3139
01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3140
01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:32.251
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3141
01:30:32.251 --> 01:30:32.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3142
01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:36.420
<v Speaker 2>not my last special but the special before where when I first started them,</v>

3143
01:30:36.421 --> 01:30:38.130
<v Speaker 2>they were not doing well at all.</v>

3144
01:30:38.190 --> 01:30:39.330
<v Speaker 2>They were not doing well at all.</v>

3145
01:30:39.331 --> 01:30:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I had to figure out a way to make them funny.</v>

3146
01:30:41.341 --> 01:30:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't you CCED on them?</v>

3147
01:30:43.410 --> 01:30:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Because I knew there was something there.</v>

3148
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:46.040
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was something there.</v>

3149
01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:47.670
<v Speaker 2>Like for instance,</v>

3150
01:30:47.671 --> 01:30:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I have this one bit on women,</v>

3151
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3152
01:30:50.370 --> 01:30:53.730
<v Speaker 2>and inventions and that women don't invent a lot of things.</v>

3153
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.930
<v Speaker 2>And I took all long time for me to figure out how to do that.</v>

3154
01:30:57.931 --> 01:31:01.920
<v Speaker 2>And the best way to do that was to talk about all the great things about women</v>

3155
01:31:01.921 --> 01:31:02.754
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

3156
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:03.811
<v Speaker 2>So I just had to,</v>

3157
01:31:03.811 --> 01:31:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I had a talk about,</v>

3158
01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:05.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3159
01:31:05.541 --> 01:31:08.790
<v Speaker 2>like the concept that women are supposed to work,</v>

3160
01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:09.630
<v Speaker 2>that we should,</v>

3161
01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:12.360
<v Speaker 2>that women are supposed to work as well as raise children,</v>

3162
01:31:12.361 --> 01:31:14.650
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking crazy because raising children,</v>

3163
01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:17.700
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying that every woman should raise children and that they</v>

3164
01:31:17.701 --> 01:31:18.480
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have a career.</v>

3165
01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:19.313
<v Speaker 2>But if you,</v>

3166
01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.720
<v Speaker 2>if you think that it's easy to raise children,</v>

3167
01:31:21.721 --> 01:31:22.950
<v Speaker 2>you're out of your fucking mind.</v>

3168
01:31:22.951 --> 01:31:26.310
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most difficult things in the world to just to have the patients</v>

3169
01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:27.540
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with this little people,</v>

3170
01:31:27.541 --> 01:31:28.530
<v Speaker 2>you have to teach them things,</v>

3171
01:31:28.531 --> 01:31:29.160
<v Speaker 2>you have to re,</v>

3172
01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:32.460
<v Speaker 2>you have to give them love and constant attention and it's very,</v>

3173
01:31:32.461 --> 01:31:33.630
<v Speaker 2>very time consuming.</v>

3174
01:31:33.631 --> 01:31:34.530
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult or,</v>

3175
01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:38.160
<v Speaker 2>and these women are making people in their fucking bodies.</v>

3176
01:31:38.161 --> 01:31:40.440
<v Speaker 2>It's the most incredible thing that anyone's ever created.</v>

3177
01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Humans,</v>

3178
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:41.940
<v Speaker 2>you make,</v>

3179
01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:43.830
<v Speaker 2>you make humans in your body.</v>

3180
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:44.131
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3181
01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:44.964
<v Speaker 2>that's insane.</v>

3182
01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:47.760
<v Speaker 2>And I would go through this whole thing and then I'd say,</v>

3183
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.140
<v Speaker 2>so ladies,</v>

3184
01:31:49.141 --> 01:31:49.651
<v Speaker 2>I love you.</v>

3185
01:31:49.651 --> 01:31:50.431
<v Speaker 2>I think you're amazing,</v>

3186
01:31:50.431 --> 01:31:51.720
<v Speaker 2>but let's be honest,</v>

3187
01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.040
<v Speaker 2>you don't invent a lot of shit.</v>

3188
01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:57.600
<v Speaker 2>And then I got into this whole thing about women inventions and then I just</v>

3189
01:31:57.601 --> 01:31:59.950
<v Speaker 2>talked about all the great inventions women make.</v>

3190
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:00.611
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3191
01:32:00.611 --> 01:32:01.620
<v Speaker 1>You sat at a different</v>

3192
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:04.290
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to do it.</v>

3193
01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:07.990
<v Speaker 1>It took a while to figure out how to do it where the women thought it was funny</v>

3194
01:32:08.190 --> 01:32:10.540
<v Speaker 1>where I gave them enough honest,</v>

3195
01:32:10.570 --> 01:32:15.460
<v Speaker 1>legitimate credit and said funny things about them that are positive first so</v>

3196
01:32:15.461 --> 01:32:17.410
<v Speaker 1>then they feel free to laugh.</v>

3197
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3198
01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:19.720
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm not a dick.</v>

3199
01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:22.160
<v Speaker 1>I just have a point that women don't have a lot of shit</v>

3200
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:27.790
<v Speaker 1>outside of say I don't invent anything that I had to get really clear about that</v>

3201
01:32:27.791 --> 01:32:28.600
<v Speaker 1>and let's be clear,</v>

3202
01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:29.710
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about us.</v>

3203
01:32:30.010 --> 01:32:30.281
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3204
01:32:30.281 --> 01:32:30.521
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3205
01:32:30.521 --> 01:32:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking moron.</v>

3206
01:32:31.511 --> 01:32:32.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm never invented shit.</v>

3207
01:32:32.351 --> 01:32:34.390
<v Speaker 1>And I'm guessing you're probably pretty dumb too,</v>

3208
01:32:34.391 --> 01:32:36.730
<v Speaker 1>which is why you are here listening to me talk.</v>

3209
01:32:37.330 --> 01:32:37.601
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3210
01:32:37.601 --> 01:32:38.560
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about us.</v>

3211
01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:42.460
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about inventors and so I was trying to remove people from the</v>

3212
01:32:42.461 --> 01:32:45.370
<v Speaker 1>tribal male versus female dynamic.</v>

3213
01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Just to talk about the fact that in history there have not been like relatively</v>

3214
01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.600
<v Speaker 1>a lot of women inventors.</v>

3215
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

3216
01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.600
<v Speaker 1>And so then they fell and then they laughed.</v>

3217
01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Then it was funny.</v>

3218
01:32:56.681 --> 01:32:57.101
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

3219
01:32:57.101 --> 01:32:58.060
<v Speaker 1>it worked out great.</v>

3220
01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:00.670
<v Speaker 1>It was like closing bit is the same thing with this.</v>

3221
01:33:00.671 --> 01:33:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3222
01:33:01.090 --> 01:33:05.290
<v Speaker 1>the joke that translated from Portuguese to English and uh,</v>

3223
01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:09.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any problem doing this in Portuguese because we don't have that</v>

3224
01:33:09.161 --> 01:33:11.140
<v Speaker 1>much talking about race and stuff.</v>

3225
01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:13.090
<v Speaker 1>He was not that one the n word,</v>

3226
01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:15.490
<v Speaker 1>but he was a joke that I used to do that.</v>

3227
01:33:15.491 --> 01:33:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3228
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I saw this guy with a tee shirt,</v>

3229
01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:20.350
<v Speaker 1>a written a hundred percent black.</v>

3230
01:33:20.690 --> 01:33:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I was going to sprout off his face or run because I find that to the palm of his</v>

3231
01:33:24.191 --> 01:33:28.150
<v Speaker 1>hand and said 99% he smiled.</v>

3232
01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:31.950
<v Speaker 1>That's said 98% that was the joke that I was doing.</v>

3233
01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:33.720
<v Speaker 1>And I had this joke here,</v>

3234
01:33:33.721 --> 01:33:34.554
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't late it.</v>

3235
01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:35.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like this little,</v>

3236
01:33:35.411 --> 01:33:35.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3237
01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3238
01:33:36.090 --> 01:33:36.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3239
01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>

3240
01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:39.790
<v Speaker 1>So this is a case of jug that I trust that it works.</v>

3241
01:33:39.850 --> 01:33:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3242
01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:40.751
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

3243
01:33:40.751 --> 01:33:41.021
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3244
01:33:41.021 --> 01:33:42.630
<v Speaker 1>rethink has a good punchline.</v>

3245
01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:43.540
<v Speaker 1>It's everything,</v>

3246
01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:46.900
<v Speaker 1>but people feel very uncomfortable who?</v>

3247
01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Not The black people.</v>

3248
01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:50.320
<v Speaker 1>The people that sit around.</v>

3249
01:33:50.321 --> 01:33:51.154
<v Speaker 1>The black guy.</v>

3250
01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:52.220
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

3251
01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:52.701
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

3252
01:33:52.701 --> 01:33:53.050
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

3253
01:33:53.050 --> 01:33:55.920
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was funny because it wasn't the human,</v>

3254
01:33:55.930 --> 01:33:56.920
<v Speaker 1>he was like laughing.</v>

3255
01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it's funny because all of those people,</v>

3256
01:33:59.681 --> 01:34:02.830
<v Speaker 1>they didn't feel that they were entitled to laugh around you.</v>

3257
01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:05.653
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of fun.</v>

3258
01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.750
<v Speaker 1>He was a uncomfortable,</v>

3259
01:34:08.290 --> 01:34:10.450
<v Speaker 1>but when I sat up as you know what,</v>

3260
01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:14.950
<v Speaker 1>you talk about race too much and we don't have that in Brazil,</v>

3261
01:34:14.951 --> 01:34:17.920
<v Speaker 1>so sometimes there's some misunderstandings.</v>

3262
01:34:18.650 --> 01:34:23.410
<v Speaker 1>So when I put myself in that position then I'm just just a mistake</v>

3263
01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:26.230
<v Speaker 1>and I don't speak English.</v>

3264
01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:27.550
<v Speaker 1>That's easy.</v>

3265
01:34:27.730 --> 01:34:28.750
<v Speaker 1>That's what I get to.</v>

3266
01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3267
01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what I eat when I,</v>

3268
01:34:30.970 --> 01:34:31.803
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

3269
01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:34.960
<v Speaker 1>when I'm free to do the same thing that your did you set up in a different way?</v>

3270
01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

3271
01:34:35.890 --> 01:34:38.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a really interesting angle too that really only someone from another</v>

3272
01:34:38.891 --> 01:34:41.800
<v Speaker 1>country can pursue this angle that like you have,</v>

3273
01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:44.500
<v Speaker 1>the America is a different culture than you're used to,</v>

3274
01:34:45.130 --> 01:34:46.930
<v Speaker 1>so that's probably so many differences.</v>

3275
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:47.321
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3276
01:34:47.321 --> 01:34:48.790
<v Speaker 1>He does a lot of differences.</v>

3277
01:34:48.791 --> 01:34:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Freaking Kardashians.</v>

3278
01:34:49.841 --> 01:34:51.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you guys squash that shit.</v>

3279
01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:56.140
<v Speaker 1>It's just like he's like for cheeks fucking hanging around.</v>

3280
01:34:56.150 --> 01:34:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Then we are like,</v>

3281
01:34:56.770 --> 01:34:58.670
<v Speaker 1>I [inaudible]</v>

3282
01:34:58.890 --> 01:35:00.290
<v Speaker 2>has nothing to it.</v>

3283

01:35:18.710 --> 01:35:19.490
<v Speaker 2>The same thing.</v>

3294
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:20.330
<v Speaker 2>It's huge over here.</v>

3295
01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:20.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know people make millions of dollars playing video games.</v>

3297
01:35:23.931 --> 01:35:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Crazy like parents tell their kids don't be a loser.</v>

3298
01:35:27.410 --> 01:35:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Play video games like wait a minute,</v>

3299
01:35:29.991 --> 01:35:30.621
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

3300
01:35:30.621 --> 01:35:32.990
<v Speaker 2>These kids are making millions of dollars and what is a loser?</v>

3301
01:35:32.991 --> 01:35:37.991
<v Speaker 2>You work all fucking year for 50 grand and this guy is making $500,000 a week</v>

3302
01:35:38.721 --> 01:35:41.510
<v Speaker 2>planned youtube playing fucking videos.</v>

3303
01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:42.981
<v Speaker 2>Twitter.</v>

3304
01:35:42.981 --> 01:35:46.970
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy and youtube gives give you much more money than he does in</v>

3305
01:35:46.971 --> 01:35:47.804
<v Speaker 2>Brazil.</v>

3306
01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:50.120
<v Speaker 2>But we have the same speech of like I have my,</v>

3307
01:35:50.121 --> 01:35:54.020
<v Speaker 2>this youtube channel called Isla Jabara was in Brazil and we are having a lot of</v>

3308
01:35:54.021 --> 01:35:54.854
<v Speaker 2>problems with,</v>

3309
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:58.700
<v Speaker 2>we are to getting not monetizing our videos is the same thing.</v>

3310
01:35:58.750 --> 01:35:59.583
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3311
01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:04.340
<v Speaker 2>We are suffering to the same problems that they don't know exactly what to do</v>

3312
01:36:04.341 --> 01:36:08.480
<v Speaker 2>because advertisers are very wary about certain content and so they have these</v>

3313
01:36:08.481 --> 01:36:12.980
<v Speaker 2>deals with these advertisers and so they're trying to suppress content because</v>

3314
01:36:12.981 --> 01:36:14.180
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to minimize,</v>

3315
01:36:14.210 --> 01:36:15.980
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to lose revenue.</v>

3316
01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:19.040
<v Speaker 2>So what they're trying to do is make advertisers happy,</v>

3317
01:36:19.041 --> 01:36:21.620
<v Speaker 2>but then the content creators feel like they're being censored.</v>

3318
01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean they are being censored,</v>

3319
01:36:23.541 --> 01:36:25.790
<v Speaker 2>but they have to understand what's happening here like this,</v>

3320
01:36:25.791 --> 01:36:26.150
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3321
01:36:26.150 --> 01:36:27.470
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff costs money.</v>

3322
01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Do you get some of your readers all the time?</v>

3323
01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:30.921
<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>

3324
01:36:30.921 --> 01:36:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man,</v>

3325
01:36:31.710 --> 01:36:31.910
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3326
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:32.030
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3327
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:33.050
<v Speaker 2>they get demonetized.</v>

3328
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:34.460
<v Speaker 2>They get demonetized.</v>

3329
01:36:34.461 --> 01:36:36.170
<v Speaker 2>If we talk about specific subjects,</v>

3330
01:36:36.230 --> 01:36:37.460
<v Speaker 2>all subjects as well.</v>

3331
01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

3332
01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

3333
01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3334
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:39.500
<v Speaker 2>not even showing images,</v>

3335
01:36:39.501 --> 01:36:41.090
<v Speaker 2>just talking about the subjects,</v>

3336
01:36:41.091 --> 01:36:41.960
<v Speaker 2>just subjects.</v>

3337
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:44.690
<v Speaker 2>And we've talked about them and we've,</v>

3338
01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:46.310
<v Speaker 2>we've complained about it a little,</v>

3339
01:36:46.311 --> 01:36:47.031
<v Speaker 2>but basically,</v>

3340
01:36:47.031 --> 01:36:47.211
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3341
01:36:47.211 --> 01:36:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

3342
01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:50.930
<v Speaker 2>we kind of take this attitude was nothing we could do.</v>

3343
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:52.430
<v Speaker 2>We just kind of keep on trucking.</v>

3344
01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:53.740
<v Speaker 2>You could just keep doing it.</v>

3345
01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3346
01:36:54.170 --> 01:36:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Because you're building much more than just,</v>

3347
01:36:56.211 --> 01:36:56.451
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3348
01:36:56.451 --> 01:36:58.970
<v Speaker 2>That money is not your main,</v>

3349
01:36:58.971 --> 01:36:59.721
<v Speaker 2>it's something,</v>

3350
01:36:59.721 --> 01:37:00.400
<v Speaker 2>it's money.</v>

3351
01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:00.710
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

3352
01:37:00.710 --> 01:37:01.543
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3353
01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:04.850
<v Speaker 2>it could be thousands of dollars for each one that they don't monetize.</v>

3354
01:37:04.851 --> 01:37:06.440
<v Speaker 2>But that's not how I,</v>

3355
01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:08.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about it that way.</v>

3356
01:37:08.181 --> 01:37:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I think about it like,</v>

3357
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.261
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3358
01:37:09.261 --> 01:37:10.094
<v Speaker 2>what's important,</v>

3359
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:13.890
<v Speaker 2>what's important is to just say what's on your mind and uh,</v>

3360
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:14.833
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3361
01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:15.051
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3362
01:37:15.051 --> 01:37:19.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to change just so that I get more youtube ad money dead.</v>

3363
01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.500
<v Speaker 2>That would ruin whatever I'm doing.</v>

3364
01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:25.670
<v Speaker 2>So I think they're going to work it out in a better way eventually.</v>

3365
01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:28.640
<v Speaker 2>But there's also a thing called a youtube red.</v>

3366
01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:30.170
<v Speaker 2>And with youtube red,</v>

3367
01:37:30.171 --> 01:37:31.880
<v Speaker 2>even if things get demonetized,</v>

3368
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:35.360
<v Speaker 2>the people that are paying for youtube see you pay for you to read.</v>

3369
01:37:35.361 --> 01:37:37.910
<v Speaker 2>So you never get any advertisers and the,</v>

3370
01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:41.480
<v Speaker 2>you still like if you got a certain amount of people that are,</v>

3371
01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I think 50% of our revenue comes from youtube,</v>

3372
01:37:44.361 --> 01:37:45.194
<v Speaker 2>red</v>

3373
01:37:46.650 --> 01:37:49.550
<v Speaker 2>to various video to video time watched,</v>

3374
01:37:49.551 --> 01:37:50.420
<v Speaker 2>kind of cumulative.</v>

3375
01:37:51.170 --> 01:37:51.710
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

3376
01:37:51.710 --> 01:37:54.530
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people are saying,</v>

3377
01:37:54.531 --> 01:37:54.741
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3378
01:37:54.741 --> 01:37:57.360
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather pay x amount of dollars per month and don't,</v>

3379
01:37:57.361 --> 01:37:58.320
<v Speaker 2>don't put any ads.</v>

3380
01:37:58.690 --> 01:38:00.690
<v Speaker 2>And so I think we're moving towards that,</v>

3381
01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.190
<v Speaker 2>that sort of,</v>

3382
01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:03.110
<v Speaker 2>that model.</v>

3383
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:04.650
<v Speaker 2>But I understand the process as well.</v>

3384
01:38:04.651 --> 01:38:07.350
<v Speaker 2>That is brands and they're paying the bills.</v>

3385
01:38:07.351 --> 01:38:07.581
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3386
01:38:07.581 --> 01:38:09.780
<v Speaker 2>that Google is not a ton free,</v>

3387
01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:10.673
<v Speaker 2>isn't the free,</v>

3388
01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:11.431
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

3389
01:38:11.431 --> 01:38:11.851
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>

3390
01:38:11.851 --> 01:38:13.650
<v Speaker 2>It's expensive and they're trying to make money too.</v>

3391
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:17.640
<v Speaker 2>So like the only reason for them to allow someone like you or I to put a video</v>

3392
01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:19.290
<v Speaker 2>up as they want to be able to profit from it,</v>

3393
01:38:19.810 --> 01:38:20.330
<v Speaker 2>send me to,</v>

3394
01:38:20.330 --> 01:38:22.450
<v Speaker 2>they're not providing a service just because they're,</v>

3395
01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:23.700
<v Speaker 2>they're good people.</v>

3396
01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.050
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to make money.</v>

3397
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.680
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

3398
01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:30.680
<v Speaker 2>But the thing which is a just easier for us is that our revenue comes from shows</v>

3399
01:38:31.141 --> 01:38:32.730
<v Speaker 2>and we can do a lot of different stuff,</v>

3400
01:38:32.731 --> 01:38:33.230
<v Speaker 2>but they're stupid.</v>

3401
01:38:33.230 --> 01:38:35.670
<v Speaker 2>They actually get their money from you too.</v>

3402
01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:36.300
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3403
01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:37.710
<v Speaker 2>That's the one that are getting hurt.</v>

3404
01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Well in the United States the real issue is a conservative speakers cause all</v>

3405
01:38:43.021 --> 01:38:44.130
<v Speaker 2>these tech companies,</v>

3406
01:38:44.131 --> 01:38:46.440
<v Speaker 2>whether it's youtube or Facebook or what have you,</v>

3407
01:38:46.441 --> 01:38:48.000
<v Speaker 2>they all lean left.</v>

3408
01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:49.470
<v Speaker 2>They're all very left wing.</v>

3409
01:38:49.770 --> 01:38:54.330
<v Speaker 2>So right wing people feel like they get censored off of all these platforms</v>

3410
01:38:54.331 --> 01:38:56.850
<v Speaker 2>before other ones maybe less on Facebook.</v>

3411
01:38:56.851 --> 01:38:57.061
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3412
01:38:57.061 --> 01:38:57.990
<v Speaker 2>Because Facebook,</v>

3413
01:38:57.991 --> 01:38:58.410
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3414
01:38:58.410 --> 01:39:02.010
<v Speaker 2>they actually make money off of people paying attention to shit.</v>

3415
01:39:02.190 --> 01:39:04.080
<v Speaker 2>So the more people argue about stuff,</v>

3416
01:39:04.081 --> 01:39:06.900
<v Speaker 2>probably the more more eyes they get the money.</v>

3417
01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:09.750
<v Speaker 2>Did they get the most of their money is people paying you,</v>

3418
01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:12.320
<v Speaker 2>paying you Facebook to promote their content?</v>

3419
01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:13.633
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah.</v>

3420
01:39:13.890 --> 01:39:15.000
<v Speaker 2>And Facebook doesn't,</v>

3421
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:16.530
<v Speaker 2>you don't make money off of Facebook.</v>

3422
01:39:16.531 --> 01:39:16.651
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3423
01:39:16.651 --> 01:39:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Is there anybody making money off of Facebook blog posts or yeah,</v>

3424
01:39:20.370 --> 01:39:23.250
<v Speaker 2>these people want that is monetizing videos,</v>

3425
01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:23.770
<v Speaker 2>videos.</v>

3426
01:39:23.770 --> 01:39:24.571
<v Speaker 2>It's very recent,</v>

3427
01:39:24.571 --> 01:39:25.620
<v Speaker 2>but not like writing.</v>

3428
01:39:25.621 --> 01:39:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Like say if you wrote an essay and they wouldn't pay for that specifically,</v>

3429
01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:32.040
<v Speaker 2>but that's where like there's a lot of,</v>

3430
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:36.750
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people like to comment on things and argue about things and so if you</v>

3431
01:39:36.751 --> 01:39:40.440
<v Speaker 2>have something controversial on Facebook that's probably value in that because</v>

3432
01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:41.730
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get more eyeballs.</v>

3433
01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3434
01:39:42.570 --> 01:39:44.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of value in controversy.</v>

3435
01:39:44.641 --> 01:39:46.560
<v Speaker 2>It's just like what kind of controversy?</v>

3436
01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.120
<v Speaker 2>So for Youtube,</v>

3437
01:39:48.121 --> 01:39:53.121
<v Speaker 2>the big thing is they like if you have like uh,</v>

3438
01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:55.500
<v Speaker 2>well specifically Twitter,</v>

3439
01:39:55.530 --> 01:39:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Twitter's been,</v>

3440
01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:59.070
<v Speaker 2>they've had big issues with it.</v>

3441
01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:00.031
<v Speaker 2>Instagram,</v>

3442
01:40:00.031 --> 01:40:01.560
<v Speaker 2>not so much with conservative people.</v>

3443
01:40:01.561 --> 01:40:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3444
01:40:02.130 --> 01:40:03.180
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear that as much?</v>

3445
01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:04.051
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

3446
01:40:04.051 --> 01:40:04.710
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3447
01:40:04.710 --> 01:40:05.940
<v Speaker 2>It's more of a Twitter,</v>

3448
01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:10.950
<v Speaker 2>youtube thing and it's conservatives feel like they're being pushed out because</v>

3449
01:40:11.670 --> 01:40:16.350
<v Speaker 2>almost overwhelmingly all the tech companies are liberal.</v>

3450
01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:20.700
<v Speaker 2>They're all very left wing and very pro gay rights,</v>

3451
01:40:20.701 --> 01:40:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Trans Rights.</v>

3452
01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:22.081
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a,</v>

3453
01:40:22.081 --> 01:40:26.460
<v Speaker 2>there's an example of this one woman who's a feminist who said that a woman is</v>

3454
01:40:26.461 --> 01:40:28.380
<v Speaker 2>not a man or a man is not a woman.</v>

3455
01:40:28.710 --> 01:40:33.420
<v Speaker 2>So like a trans woman who used to be a man and turn into a woman.</v>

3456
01:40:33.690 --> 01:40:36.270
<v Speaker 2>Her take is a man is never a woman.</v>

3457
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:37.143
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3458
01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:39.300
<v Speaker 2>And so they told that you got to remove this.</v>

3459
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:42.780
<v Speaker 2>She removed it and then apparently took a screenshot of it and posted it up</v>

3460
01:40:42.781 --> 01:40:43.230
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

3461
01:40:43.230 --> 01:40:43.621
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

3462
01:40:43.621 --> 01:40:43.891
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3463
01:40:43.891 --> 01:40:44.521
<v Speaker 2>I'll delete that.</v>

3464
01:40:44.521 --> 01:40:46.110
<v Speaker 2>And she took a screenshot and then posted it again,</v>

3465
01:40:46.111 --> 01:40:46.201
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3466
01:40:46.201 --> 01:40:47.034
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

3467
01:40:47.130 --> 01:40:50.040
<v Speaker 2>And so then they banned there for life and now she's suing that woman.</v>

3468
01:40:50.041 --> 01:40:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Megan,</v>

3469
01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:51.653
<v Speaker 2>what is her name?</v>

3470
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:52.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3471
01:40:52.590 --> 01:40:53.423
<v Speaker 2>I forget her.</v>

3472
01:40:54.690 --> 01:40:57.600
<v Speaker 2>I got it right here because someone just sent me something to Sam Harris just</v>

3473
01:40:57.601 --> 01:40:58.630
<v Speaker 2>sent me something about it today.</v>

3474
01:40:58.960 --> 01:40:59.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3475
01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:01.060
<v Speaker 2>her name is,</v>

3476
01:41:01.061 --> 01:41:02.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3477
01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:03.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3478
01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:04.293
<v Speaker 2>Megan Murphy.</v>

3479
01:41:05.230 --> 01:41:07.120
<v Speaker 2>So she's a feminist and she's just like,</v>

3480
01:41:07.121 --> 01:41:07.301
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3481
01:41:07.301 --> 01:41:08.560
<v Speaker 2>you can't just become a woman.</v>

3482
01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Fuck off.</v>

3483
01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

3484
01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:10.331
<v Speaker 2>And so they're like,</v>

3485
01:41:10.331 --> 01:41:11.141
<v Speaker 2>you're banned for life.</v>

3486
01:41:11.141 --> 01:41:11.801
<v Speaker 2>And then everybody's like,</v>

3487
01:41:11.801 --> 01:41:11.921
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3488
01:41:11.921 --> 01:41:12.401
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy.</v>

3489
01:41:12.401 --> 01:41:13.061
<v Speaker 2>You can't banner,</v>

3490
01:41:13.061 --> 01:41:13.900
<v Speaker 2>which she's got an opinion.</v>

3491
01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:15.550
<v Speaker 2>How come she can't have that opinion?</v>

3492
01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:18.520
<v Speaker 2>Like if that's a biological opinion,</v>

3493
01:41:18.521 --> 01:41:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might be controversial,</v>

3494
01:41:19.811 --> 01:41:20.591
<v Speaker 2>it might be rude,</v>

3495
01:41:20.591 --> 01:41:21.371
<v Speaker 2>it might be insensitive,</v>

3496
01:41:21.371 --> 01:41:22.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's the same process.</v>

3497
01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Joe Is the same thing that I lived in Brazil is like it's the sponsor doesn't</v>

3498
01:41:25.661 --> 01:41:26.710
<v Speaker 2>want you to say that.</v>

3499
01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.060
<v Speaker 2>How can you argue it?</v>

3500
01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's a sponsor issue because this is Twitter because I don't</v>

3501
01:41:31.151 --> 01:41:32.050
<v Speaker 2>think that's a sponsor.</v>

3502
01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3503
01:41:32.170 --> 01:41:35.430
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a left weaning corporation was decided bald.</v>

3504
01:41:35.431 --> 01:41:35.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3505
01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:39.280
<v Speaker 2>They've decided to censor certain type of speech that they think is offensive</v>

3506
01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:44.140
<v Speaker 2>and she was apparently saying it to the person who was a trans person.</v>

3507
01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Like a a man is never a woman.</v>

3508
01:41:46.630 --> 01:41:48.820
<v Speaker 2>And by saying that to the Trans Person,</v>

3509
01:41:48.821 --> 01:41:50.920
<v Speaker 2>they're saying that and it was like targeted harassment.</v>

3510
01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:55.000
<v Speaker 2>But don't you think that the end of the process edis about money because you</v>

3511
01:41:55.001 --> 01:41:56.740
<v Speaker 2>think tweeter care that much.</v>

3512
01:41:56.741 --> 01:41:57.281
<v Speaker 2>I saw the,</v>

3513
01:41:57.281 --> 01:42:01.000
<v Speaker 2>the Twitter guy here for me to look that he cared about Bush,</v>

3514
01:42:01.001 --> 01:42:01.271
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

3515
01:42:01.271 --> 01:42:02.104
<v Speaker 2>about uh,</v>

3516
01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:06.490
<v Speaker 2>a bold the speech side of things because there are companies,</v>

3517
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:10.750
<v Speaker 2>sole date they have to pay their bills and they have to bring sponsors and even</v>

3518
01:42:10.751 --> 01:42:14.370
<v Speaker 2>brands that are more left sided hearing this country.</v>

3519
01:42:14.371 --> 01:42:16.120
<v Speaker 2>So cause that's where it's sensitive,</v>

3520
01:42:16.121 --> 01:42:16.351
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3521
01:42:16.351 --> 01:42:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's where you can,</v>

3522
01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:18.340
<v Speaker 2>you can get boycotted there.</v>

3523
01:42:18.370 --> 01:42:20.470
<v Speaker 2>I think there's definitely something to what you're saying that,</v>

3524
01:42:20.471 --> 01:42:21.320
<v Speaker 2>but I think also,</v>

3525
01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:21.910
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

3526
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:25.240
<v Speaker 2>if you're a CEO of a major corporation like Twitter or something like that,</v>

3527
01:42:25.241 --> 01:42:26.870
<v Speaker 2>you are responsible to stockholders.</v>

3528
01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:29.440
<v Speaker 2>You're responsible to all the people that work on the board,</v>

3529
01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:30.293
<v Speaker 2>the your truck,</v>

3530
01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:30.820
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3531
01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:32.170
<v Speaker 2>if you want to stay CEO,</v>

3532
01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:34.660
<v Speaker 2>you got to continue to make more and more money every year.</v>

3533
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:36.460
<v Speaker 2>You got to bring more people to the platform,</v>

3534
01:42:36.461 --> 01:42:40.120
<v Speaker 2>make the platform more popular and make more money and in their eyes,</v>

3535
01:42:40.121 --> 01:42:43.540
<v Speaker 2>the way to do that and to maximize that is to limit harassment,</v>

3536
01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:44.441
<v Speaker 2>limit things to this.</v>

3537
01:42:44.441 --> 01:42:46.510
<v Speaker 2>These are our social decisions,</v>

3538
01:42:46.511 --> 01:42:47.021
<v Speaker 2>but they're also,</v>

3539
01:42:47.021 --> 01:42:50.200
<v Speaker 2>business strategies are two different things together at the same time.</v>

3540
01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:51.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3541
01:42:51.251 --> 01:42:52.030
<v Speaker 2>So it's uh,</v>

3542
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:53.260
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking complex.</v>

3543
01:42:53.261 --> 01:42:54.040
<v Speaker 2>Manky yeah.</v>

3544
01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:55.450
<v Speaker 2>And they don't know what the fuck they're doing.</v>

3545
01:42:55.451 --> 01:42:56.810
<v Speaker 2>This is uncharted territory.</v>

3546
01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:57.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3547
01:42:57.130 --> 01:42:58.870
<v Speaker 2>there's never been a thing like Twitter before.</v>

3548
01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:00.460
<v Speaker 2>There's never been a thing like Facebook before.</v>

3549
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:03.730
<v Speaker 2>We're complete uncharted territory in 2019,</v>

3550
01:43:03.790 --> 01:43:04.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's amazing,</v>

3551
01:43:04.661 --> 01:43:04.901
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3552
01:43:04.901 --> 01:43:09.901
<v Speaker 2>It is amazing to see people like you and me creating our own channels.</v>

3553
01:43:10.331 --> 01:43:12.550
<v Speaker 2>We are our old ndcs.</v>

3554
01:43:12.670 --> 01:43:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3555
01:43:13.210 --> 01:43:15.670
<v Speaker 2>So we don't have to depend on that that much.</v>

3556
01:43:15.671 --> 01:43:16.320
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

3557
01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:17.350
<v Speaker 2>you'll feel free.</v>

3558
01:43:17.710 --> 01:43:19.840
<v Speaker 2>That's when creativity comes up.</v>

3559
01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:21.220
<v Speaker 2>That's one.</v>

3560
01:43:21.221 --> 01:43:22.960
<v Speaker 2>People are start to be creative.</v>

3561
01:43:22.961 --> 01:43:26.830
<v Speaker 2>That's when new stuff that's so it becomes a threat as well.</v>

3562
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:27.161
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3563
01:43:27.161 --> 01:43:29.350
<v Speaker 2>when you stop and think about the sheer impact,</v>

3564
01:43:29.351 --> 01:43:29.820
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>

3565
01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:33.820
<v Speaker 2>What was the number that our channel Gut in terms of minutes watched?</v>

3566
01:43:33.970 --> 01:43:34.810
<v Speaker 2>What was that number?</v>

3567
01:43:35.070 --> 01:43:39.300
<v Speaker 3>Looked for shit for the year.</v>

3568
01:43:39.301 --> 01:43:43.620
<v Speaker 3>For last year it was 16.1 billion minutes watched.</v>

3569
01:43:45.890 --> 01:43:49.520
<v Speaker 2>That's more than every human on the planet watching it a minute.</v>

3570
01:43:50.630 --> 01:43:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Think of isn't it crazy?</v>

3571
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Way More.</v>

3572
01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:57.720
<v Speaker 2>That's more than double every human on the planet watching for a minute.</v>

3573
01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

3574
01:44:00.231 --> 01:44:01.500
<v Speaker 2>I guess it has some fans,</v>

3575
01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:02.510
<v Speaker 2>but there's not even that.</v>

3576
01:44:02.511 --> 01:44:04.310
<v Speaker 2>It's just that's the impact.</v>

3577
01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:06.440
<v Speaker 2>The impact of that is insane.</v>

3578
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:07.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3579
01:44:07.610 --> 01:44:08.930
<v Speaker 2>negative and positive,</v>

3580
01:44:08.931 --> 01:44:09.920
<v Speaker 2>pro and con,</v>

3581
01:44:09.921 --> 01:44:10.431
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>

3582
01:44:10.431 --> 01:44:11.264
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing.</v>

3583
01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:12.111
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>

3584
01:44:12.111 --> 01:44:17.090
<v Speaker 2>the amount of content that gets put out there and the amount of interactions and</v>

3585
01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:19.340
<v Speaker 2>the amount of debate that comes from that content.</v>

3586
01:44:19.341 --> 01:44:20.174
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

3587
01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:21.140
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

3588
01:44:21.141 --> 01:44:21.711
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>

3589
01:44:21.711 --> 01:44:23.120
<v Speaker 2>the only thing I could do is just walk away.</v>

3590
01:44:23.121 --> 01:44:24.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck's going on.</v>

3591
01:44:24.261 --> 01:44:26.500
<v Speaker 2>I just throw it out there and get the fuck away from it.</v>

3592
01:44:26.530 --> 01:44:27.730
<v Speaker 2>You don't read anything,</v>

3593
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.911
<v Speaker 2>read Shit.</v>

3594
01:44:28.911 --> 01:44:29.331
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>

3595
01:44:29.331 --> 01:44:29.800
<v Speaker 2>You can go,</v>

3596
01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:30.350
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

3597
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:31.910
<v Speaker 2>You get caught up in all of it.</v>

3598
01:44:31.911 --> 01:44:32.360
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>

3599
01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:35.000
<v Speaker 2>you would get caught up in the negative or maybe even worse,</v>

3600
01:44:35.001 --> 01:44:37.070
<v Speaker 2>caught up in the positive people kiss your ass.</v>

3601
01:44:37.071 --> 01:44:37.940
<v Speaker 2>You start believing it.</v>

3602
01:44:38.010 --> 01:44:38.810
<v Speaker 2>So I just put,</v>

3603
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:42.950
<v Speaker 2>I try to be humble and if there's an overwhelming negative reaction,</v>

3604
01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:43.791
<v Speaker 2>I hear about it.</v>

3605
01:44:43.791 --> 01:44:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Having to try to adjust and address it and,</v>

3606
01:44:46.350 --> 01:44:48.100
<v Speaker 2>and respect the,</v>

3607
01:44:48.110 --> 01:44:52.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm in this unique position where I do have this weird sort of a platform.</v>

3608
01:44:52.090 --> 01:44:53.600
<v Speaker 2>I'll start with talking about the,</v>

3609
01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:58.550
<v Speaker 2>that you thought that you were in that informed to do the Twitter guy.</v>

3610
01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:58.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3611
01:44:58.701 --> 01:45:01.250
<v Speaker 2>That's why I brought Tim Poolan because Tim's a good guy.</v>

3612
01:45:01.251 --> 01:45:01.851
<v Speaker 2>He's a good friend.</v>

3613
01:45:01.851 --> 01:45:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Isabelle and math came in Brazil.</v>

3614
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:05.950
<v Speaker 2>She went there to cover our protests.</v>

3615
01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

3616
01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3617
01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:07.281
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3618
01:45:07.281 --> 01:45:09.050
<v Speaker 2>he's on legitimate investigative,</v>

3619
01:45:09.051 --> 01:45:12.920
<v Speaker 2>independent journalist and a real honorable guy and honest,</v>

3620
01:45:12.921 --> 01:45:14.810
<v Speaker 2>intelligent and well informed.</v>

3621
01:45:15.110 --> 01:45:17.840
<v Speaker 2>So I knew he was the perfect guy and we're going to do some other things.</v>

3622
01:45:17.841 --> 01:45:18.260
<v Speaker 2>He and I,</v>

3623
01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:20.260
<v Speaker 2>we got something that's going to blow people away when,</v>

3624
01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:21.141
<v Speaker 2>when that happens.</v>

3625
01:45:21.141 --> 01:45:21.661
<v Speaker 2>That was good.</v>

3626
01:45:21.661 --> 01:45:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3627
01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:22.540
<v Speaker 2>it's this,</v>

3628
01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:23.630
<v Speaker 2>he sent me a message yesterday.</v>

3629
01:45:23.631 --> 01:45:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh side that you're going into a row goes.</v>

3630
01:45:25.041 --> 01:45:25.431
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3631
01:45:25.431 --> 01:45:25.891
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3632
01:45:25.891 --> 01:45:26.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3633
01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:26.481
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3634
01:45:26.481 --> 01:45:27.560
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk about it right now,</v>

3635
01:45:27.561 --> 01:45:31.400
<v Speaker 2>but we've got something cooking that might have changed to the those teams.</v>

3636
01:45:31.401 --> 01:45:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Real.</v>

3637
01:45:32.130 --> 01:45:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I still don't have to do some things.</v>

3638
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:37.470
<v Speaker 2>There's some things he focused on her kids,</v>

3639
01:45:38.630 --> 01:45:38.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3640
01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:39.800
<v Speaker 2>they're in school right now.</v>

3641
01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:40.873
<v Speaker 2>See the thing is,</v>

3642
01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:43.960
<v Speaker 2>this happens whether in school and then comedy happens whether asleep.</v>

3643
01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:45.530
<v Speaker 2>So I have it down to a science.</v>

3644
01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3645
01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:47.760
<v Speaker 2>So what it is is they go to school.</v>

3646
01:45:47.970 --> 01:45:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3647
01:45:48.230 --> 01:45:50.150
<v Speaker 2>I get up with them to AA there.</v>

3648
01:45:50.151 --> 01:45:53.380
<v Speaker 2>I take them to school and my wife takes him to school and then I go either work</v>

3649
01:45:53.381 --> 01:45:53.960
<v Speaker 2>out either.</v>

3650
01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:56.870
<v Speaker 2>I do yoga or lift weights or Jujitsu or whatever in the morning.</v>

3651
01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Then I come here,</v>

3652
01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:00.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm done in the afternoon.</v>

3653
01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Then I hang out with them until it's time to eat.</v>

3654
01:46:02.721 --> 01:46:05.780
<v Speaker 2>We eat dinner and then after dinner they go to bed.</v>

3655
01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:07.070
<v Speaker 2>They go to bed like eight o'clock.</v>

3656
01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:11.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't do a set until 10 so I leave the house after that and then you know,</v>

3657
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:13.430
<v Speaker 2>I can go there and my wife was happy to get rid of me,</v>

3658
01:46:14.610 --> 01:46:15.660
<v Speaker 2>come to the comedy store,</v>

3659
01:46:15.661 --> 01:46:16.960
<v Speaker 2>hanging out and then I,</v>

3660
01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:18.200
<v Speaker 2>so it works.</v>

3661
01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:20.600
<v Speaker 2>I got it down to a science I want to,</v>

3662
01:46:21.010 --> 01:46:22.400
<v Speaker 2>that's the life that I want to.</v>

3663
01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh fortunately my wife left while you were talking about that.</v>

3664
01:46:27.051 --> 01:46:28.160
<v Speaker 2>If you want to talk about that.</v>

3665
01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:28.740
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

3666
01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:31.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't care cause it's kind of a crazy story.</v>

3667
01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:32.850
<v Speaker 2>I actually say this little stages,</v>

3668
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:33.650
<v Speaker 2>the line that flicks.</v>

3669
01:46:33.650 --> 01:46:34.483
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

3670
01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3671
01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:37.730
<v Speaker 2>And my wife left before a cult.</v>

3672
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:39.500
<v Speaker 2>She joined a cult.</v>

3673
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:41.570
<v Speaker 2>He was crazy.</v>

3674
01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:42.493
<v Speaker 2>He will ask,</v>

3675
01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:43.640
<v Speaker 2>you will ask man.</v>

3676
01:46:43.670 --> 01:46:45.230
<v Speaker 2>But it's like one of those self help culture.</v>

3677
01:46:45.250 --> 01:46:46.083
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3678
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:47.360
<v Speaker 2>But it is a cult.</v>

3679
01:46:47.450 --> 01:46:48.590
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of cults.</v>

3680
01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:49.890
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous.</v>

3681
01:46:49.891 --> 01:46:54.810
<v Speaker 2>When one person starts telling another person how you must live your life,</v>

3682
01:46:55.170 --> 01:46:56.190
<v Speaker 2>these are the principles.</v>

3683
01:46:56.191 --> 01:46:57.240
<v Speaker 2>This is what you have to do.</v>

3684
01:46:57.241 --> 01:46:58.740
<v Speaker 2>You have to leave your family.</v>

3685
01:46:58.950 --> 01:47:00.330
<v Speaker 2>You have to quit your job.</v>

3686
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:01.830
<v Speaker 2>You have to change the way you dress.</v>

3687
01:47:01.831 --> 01:47:03.150
<v Speaker 2>You have to change the way you talk.</v>

3688
01:47:03.151 --> 01:47:04.410
<v Speaker 2>You have to do this and do that.</v>

3689
01:47:04.590 --> 01:47:09.480
<v Speaker 2>When someone tells you that and they get a mass group of people to do things</v>

3690
01:47:09.481 --> 01:47:10.080
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

3691
01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:14.490
<v Speaker 2>it becomes very dangerous sometimes is not that direct.</v>

3692
01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's just like,</v>

3693
01:47:16.471 --> 01:47:17.280
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3694
01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:17.581
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3695
01:47:17.581 --> 01:47:22.581
<v Speaker 2>what was difficult is that her cult was teaching her that you got to love</v>

3696
01:47:23.161 --> 01:47:24.360
<v Speaker 2>everybody the same,</v>

3697
01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:27.090
<v Speaker 2>which is awesome if you think about it.</v>

3698
01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Jesus did that.</v>

3699
01:47:28.021 --> 01:47:29.480
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the only one who did that.</v>

3700
01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Jesus was the only one who was like,</v>

3701
01:47:31.531 --> 01:47:32.364
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

3702
01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:34.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to have kids.</v>

3703
01:47:34.290 --> 01:47:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3704
01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:36.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to think this prostitute over here.</v>

3705
01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:36.953
<v Speaker 2>And that's okay.</v>

3706
01:47:37.010 --> 01:47:37.843
<v Speaker 2>That was his life.</v>

3707
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.903
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3708
01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:40.410
<v Speaker 2>for my,</v>

3709
01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:41.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3710
01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:41.590
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

3711
01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:42.151
<v Speaker 2>when she got,</v>

3712
01:47:42.151 --> 01:47:43.470
<v Speaker 2>when you'll learn that you,</v>

3713
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:44.611
<v Speaker 2>when you were learned at,</v>

3714
01:47:44.611 --> 01:47:46.380
<v Speaker 2>you have to love everybody the same.</v>

3715
01:47:46.381 --> 01:47:51.381
<v Speaker 2>Why are you going to focus just one man in a marriage and you have to go home</v>

3716
01:47:52.801 --> 01:47:53.634
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3717
01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:54.600
<v Speaker 2>you kind of fall,</v>

3718
01:47:54.610 --> 01:47:56.250
<v Speaker 2>leave your life to yourself.</v>

3719
01:47:56.940 --> 01:48:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe she didn't love me anymore and I'm fucking blaming the on baby.</v>

3720
01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:03.130
<v Speaker 2>That would be the two as what happened.</v>

3721
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Some people are very easily influenced,</v>

3722
01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:07.560
<v Speaker 2>you know that that is a real,</v>

3723
01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:08.400
<v Speaker 2>the real issue.</v>

3724
01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:11.370
<v Speaker 2>And I worry about that sometimes when I talk to people cause like some people</v>

3725
01:48:11.371 --> 01:48:11.551
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3726
01:48:11.551 --> 01:48:12.330

01:48:13.021 --> 01:48:13.830
<v Speaker 2>you changed my life.</v>

3730
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:14.071
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3731
01:48:14.071 --> 01:48:14.791
<v Speaker 2>listen motherfucker,</v>

3732
01:48:14.791 --> 01:48:15.624
<v Speaker 2>I didn't change shit.</v>

3733
01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:16.553
<v Speaker 2>You changed your life.</v>

3734
01:48:16.650 --> 01:48:16.891
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3735
01:48:16.891 --> 01:48:17.724
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know yet.</v>

3736
01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:18.990
<v Speaker 2>I did not change your life.</v>

3737
01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Don't listen to me.</v>

3738
01:48:19.951 --> 01:48:22.320
<v Speaker 2>All I'm doing is talking to a bunch of people.</v>

3739
01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:24.330
<v Speaker 2>All of these people have something to offer.</v>

3740
01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has something to offer,</v>

3741
01:48:25.441 --> 01:48:26.274
<v Speaker 2>but it's not me.</v>

3742
01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm an antenna.</v>

3743
01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3744
01:48:28.410 --> 01:48:28.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3745
01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3746
01:48:28.990 --> 01:48:29.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3747
01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:29.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3748
01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:30.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a,</v>

3749
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.250
<v Speaker 2>if I'm saying something that resonates with you and it helps you,</v>

3750
01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm very happy but don't listen to me.</v>

3751
01:48:35.311 --> 01:48:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I know everything I think is awesome that you're doing that.</v>

3752
01:48:37.811 --> 01:48:42.780
<v Speaker 2>But because you know the power that is half and how you could actually influence</v>

3753
01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:45.190
<v Speaker 2>a being flinched in their lives,</v>

3754
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:46.080
<v Speaker 2>in the band.</v>

3755
01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:49.980
<v Speaker 2>Very careful of people that do tell you that they have the answers and they're</v>

3756
01:48:49.981 --> 01:48:53.310
<v Speaker 2>the one and they're the smart ones and you need to listen to them because that</v>

3757
01:48:53.670 --> 01:48:58.200
<v Speaker 2>those people are fucking dangerous because they can get you to do things that</v>

3758
01:48:58.201 --> 01:48:59.250
<v Speaker 2>are irreversible.</v>

3759
01:48:59.250 --> 01:49:00.780
<v Speaker 2>They can get you to leave your family,</v>

3760
01:49:00.781 --> 01:49:01.620
<v Speaker 2>they can get you to,</v>

3761
01:49:01.621 --> 01:49:01.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3762
01:49:01.981 --> 01:49:05.850
<v Speaker 2>to join this fucking commune and give up all your worldly belongings.</v>

3763
01:49:05.851 --> 01:49:08.040
<v Speaker 2>And you realize years later where they're fucking crazy.</v>

3764
01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:09.031
<v Speaker 2>Like that wild,</v>

3765
01:49:09.031 --> 01:49:11.540
<v Speaker 2>wild country documentary that we were talking about us crazy.</v>

3766
01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:12.991
<v Speaker 2>They didn't really,</v>

3767
01:49:12.991 --> 01:49:16.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean these people were the Hollywood fucking executives and producers,</v>

3768
01:49:16.621 --> 01:49:19.260
<v Speaker 2>millionaires know people that look like on paper,</v>

3769
01:49:19.261 --> 01:49:22.860
<v Speaker 2>they have their life in order and they want to go and where the red clothes and</v>

3770
01:49:22.861 --> 01:49:23.830
<v Speaker 2>the beads and,</v>

3771
01:49:23.831 --> 01:49:24.081
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3772
01:49:24.081 --> 01:49:25.920
<v Speaker 2>and be a part of this fucking movement.</v>

3773
01:49:26.190 --> 01:49:27.540
<v Speaker 2>People need a reason to leave.</v>

3774
01:49:27.541 --> 01:49:30.810
<v Speaker 2>People need explanation for things that they cannot explain.</v>

3775
01:49:31.170 --> 01:49:36.150
<v Speaker 2>And when there's someone that had no thinks that they know the answers,</v>

3776
01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:37.320
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>

3777
01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:37.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3778
01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:39.330
<v Speaker 2>they can lie because it's the easiest.</v>

3779
01:49:39.331 --> 01:49:43.230
<v Speaker 2>It's now going to have someone that is going to save if it's true or not.</v>

3780
01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3781
01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:46.920
<v Speaker 2>That's also the danger of a platform and that's the danger of something like</v>

3782
01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:47.860
<v Speaker 2>even this podcast,</v>

3783
01:49:47.861 --> 01:49:49.600
<v Speaker 2>the danger of any platform.</v>

3784
01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Anytime we have one person that's talking in front of a microphone and everyone</v>

3785
01:49:53.921 --> 01:49:54.760
<v Speaker 2>else is listening,</v>

3786
01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:55.720
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

3787
01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:56.200
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3788
01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:01.200
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird position to be in and you hear this person through your ear phones</v>

3789
01:50:01.931 --> 01:50:04.870
<v Speaker 2>or through your computer screen and you start thinking that,</v>

3790
01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:08.350
<v Speaker 2>that they're making sense and that they're right because there's no one to</v>

3791
01:50:08.351 --> 01:50:10.030
<v Speaker 2>counter what they're saying in front of them.</v>

3792
01:50:10.031 --> 01:50:11.710
<v Speaker 2>There's no one with opposing opinions.</v>

3793
01:50:11.950 --> 01:50:13.930
<v Speaker 2>There's no one and you,</v>

3794
01:50:13.931 --> 01:50:14.390
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3795
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:15.220
<v Speaker 2>you can get written,</v>

3796
01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:18.400
<v Speaker 2>they can get wrapped up in this position of being a leader as well.</v>

3797
01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:21.580
<v Speaker 2>People get intoxicated by being a leader,</v>

3798
01:50:21.970 --> 01:50:22.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3799
01:50:22.181 --> 01:50:22.630
<v Speaker 2>being a,</v>

3800
01:50:22.630 --> 01:50:22.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

3801
01:50:22.991 --> 01:50:25.330
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it with people that just teach martial arts.</v>

3802
01:50:25.570 --> 01:50:29.410
<v Speaker 2>A lot of martial arts classes turn into like very cult like places.</v>

3803
01:50:29.710 --> 01:50:30.311
<v Speaker 2>I noticed that,</v>

3804
01:50:30.311 --> 01:50:35.311
<v Speaker 2>especially before the UFC came around because everyone really legitimately</v>

3805
01:50:35.411 --> 01:50:38.200
<v Speaker 2>believe that their martial arts instructor could kill everyone on the planet.</v>

3806
01:50:38.740 --> 01:50:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Everyone really believed that and they'll like the eighties and the nineties and</v>

3807
01:50:42.141 --> 01:50:42.610
<v Speaker 2>rice,</v>

3808
01:50:42.610 --> 01:50:45.270
<v Speaker 2>they should them that it was not through voice,</v>

3809
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:48.730
<v Speaker 2>always crazy change the fucking world.</v>

3810
01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:49.451
<v Speaker 2>He really did.</v>

3811
01:50:49.451 --> 01:50:52.900
<v Speaker 2>He changed the whole world and he changed our perception of what martial arts</v>

3812
01:50:52.901 --> 01:50:54.610
<v Speaker 2>are and what's effective and what's not.</v>

3813
01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:55.661
<v Speaker 2>But before that,</v>

3814
01:50:55.661 --> 01:50:55.871
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3815
01:50:55.871 --> 01:50:57.670
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a taekwondo school,</v>

3816
01:50:57.671 --> 01:51:00.700
<v Speaker 2>which was very disciplined in everything everyone was sir,</v>

3817
01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:01.511
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

3818
01:51:01.511 --> 01:51:04.840
<v Speaker 2>you would call everyone Mr. Smith or you know Mr O'malley,</v>

3819
01:51:04.841 --> 01:51:05.171
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>

3820
01:51:05.171 --> 01:51:06.004
<v Speaker 2>Mr. Kim.</v>

3821
01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:07.151
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>

3822
01:51:07.151 --> 01:51:08.230
<v Speaker 2>If someone said something to me,</v>

3823
01:51:08.231 --> 01:51:09.190
<v Speaker 2>I would always say yes sir.</v>

3824
01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>

3825
01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:11.050
<v Speaker 2>And it was always bowing.</v>

3826
01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:14.140
<v Speaker 2>It was very strict and very disciplined.</v>

3827
01:51:14.410 --> 01:51:16.810
<v Speaker 2>And I came from a very good school,</v>

3828
01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:19.450
<v Speaker 2>but I was around a lot of schools that weren't good.</v>

3829
01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:22.360
<v Speaker 2>I saw a lot of very cult like behavior.</v>

3830
01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:27.130
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of men who would take advantage sexually of their students and</v>

3831
01:51:27.131 --> 01:51:27.521
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

3832
01:51:27.521 --> 01:51:27.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3833
01:51:27.850 --> 01:51:31.150
<v Speaker 2>they would do weird shit to their students and they would be almost like running</v>

3834
01:51:31.151 --> 01:51:32.230
<v Speaker 2>a little sex cult.</v>

3835
01:51:32.490 --> 01:51:34.670
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of were talking about your stroke or</v>

3836
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:38.020
<v Speaker 2>karate school across schools.</v>

3837
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Kung Fu schools.</v>

3838
01:51:39.401 --> 01:51:40.000
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

3839
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.350
<v Speaker 2>We all knew about that.</v>

3840
01:51:41.351 --> 01:51:43.090
<v Speaker 2>And some of them wound up going to jail.</v>

3841
01:51:43.330 --> 01:51:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I knew,</v>

3842
01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:44.980
<v Speaker 2>I knew guys that went to jail.</v>

3843
01:51:44.981 --> 01:51:46.240
<v Speaker 2>They went to jail for rape.</v>

3844
01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3845
01:51:47.230 --> 01:51:47.741
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

3846
01:51:47.741 --> 01:51:49.330
<v Speaker 2>there was people that like,</v>

3847
01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:54.040
<v Speaker 2>they were in these positions of power where their students looked at them like a</v>

3848
01:51:54.041 --> 01:51:56.350
<v Speaker 2>god and they took advantage of it.</v>

3849
01:51:56.830 --> 01:51:57.790
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

3850
01:51:57.791 --> 01:51:58.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3851
01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:59.860
<v Speaker 2>this is the same thing.</v>

3852
01:51:59.890 --> 01:52:01.900
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing as what we're talking about here.</v>

3853
01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:05.080
<v Speaker 2>When one person has too much power and influence in a platform,</v>

3854
01:52:05.290 --> 01:52:08.500
<v Speaker 2>one of the beautiful things about your Jitsu is it's in formality.</v>

3855
01:52:08.890 --> 01:52:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Like when,</v>

3856
01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:11.320
<v Speaker 2>like my instructor John Jacques Machado,</v>

3857
01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:13.420
<v Speaker 2>he's the friendliest,</v>

3858
01:52:13.450 --> 01:52:14.890
<v Speaker 2>nicest guy.</v>

3859
01:52:15.010 --> 01:52:16.540
<v Speaker 2>He's a world champion.</v>

3860
01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:16.961
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3861
01:52:16.961 --> 01:52:18.700
<v Speaker 2>he's super respected by all,</v>

3862
01:52:18.701 --> 01:52:19.451
<v Speaker 2>but when you meet him,</v>

3863
01:52:19.451 --> 01:52:19.721
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

3864
01:52:19.721 --> 01:52:20.501
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3865
01:52:20.501 --> 01:52:21.281
<v Speaker 2>how are you?</v>

3866
01:52:21.281 --> 01:52:25.950
<v Speaker 2>It's all hugs and claps and he doesn't ever pretend to be any of the,</v>

3867
01:52:25.951 --> 01:52:28.120
<v Speaker 2>any roles with everybody trains with everyone.</v>

3868
01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:33.370
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the in formality and the brothership and Camaraderie and the family</v>

3869
01:52:33.371 --> 01:52:37.570
<v Speaker 2>environment that is fostered by Brazilian Jujitsu is a very unique in martial</v>

3870
01:52:37.571 --> 01:52:42.280
<v Speaker 2>arts and that I think is very important because the respect comes from their,</v>

3871
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:44.560
<v Speaker 2>their ability and from leading by example,</v>

3872
01:52:44.770 --> 01:52:49.770
<v Speaker 2>it come from some fake position of being some master of the death touch in some</v>

3873
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.060
<v Speaker 2>all knowing person who at the top of the mountain.</v>

3874
01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:55.880
<v Speaker 2>We all thought our instructor could kill everyone on the planet.</v>

3875
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.863
<v Speaker 2>We really did.</v>

3876
01:52:57.170 --> 01:52:58.520
<v Speaker 2>And when the UFC came along,</v>

3877
01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:02.030
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of people that was a just a bucket of cold water thrown in your face.</v>

3878
01:53:02.031 --> 01:53:02.864
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3879
01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

3880
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:06.050
<v Speaker 2>that little skinny guy just choked out.</v>

3881
01:53:06.051 --> 01:53:08.540
<v Speaker 2>All those big giant people like what the fuck man.</v>

3882
01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:09.600
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

3883
01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:09.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3884
01:53:09.811 --> 01:53:13.860
<v Speaker 1>they weren't doing that for a long time in Brazil and beaches and going to</v>

3885
01:53:13.861 --> 01:53:16.130
<v Speaker 1>houses and they're going to gyms and just kicking</v>

3886
01:53:16.170 --> 01:53:17.070
<v Speaker 2>people's faces.</v>

3887
01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:18.060
<v Speaker 2>I fucking,</v>

3888
01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:18.893
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

3889
01:53:19.530 --> 01:53:19.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3890
01:53:19.951 --> 01:53:20.161
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3891
01:53:20.161 --> 01:53:20.371
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3892
01:53:20.371 --> 01:53:22.170
<v Speaker 2>they changed what martial arts are.</v>

3893
01:53:22.171 --> 01:53:23.004
<v Speaker 2>They really did.</v>

3894
01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:26.130
<v Speaker 2>They boiled it down to what's most effective and they,</v>

3895
01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:31.280
<v Speaker 2>they took ground fighting and they turned it into this perfect sort of blend of</v>

3896
01:53:32.461 --> 01:53:37.080
<v Speaker 2>leverage and technique and knowledge and repetition and training and,</v>

3897
01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:38.280
<v Speaker 2>and they just,</v>

3898
01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:42.840
<v Speaker 2>they revolutionized joint manipulation and strangling people.</v>

3899
01:53:43.110 --> 01:53:44.190
<v Speaker 2>They revolutionized it.</v>

3900
01:53:44.191 --> 01:53:45.021
<v Speaker 2>They changed it to two.</v>

3901
01:53:45.021 --> 01:53:46.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different thing.</v>

3902
01:53:46.770 --> 01:53:49.590
<v Speaker 2>There was always submissions in judo.</v>

3903
01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:51.120
<v Speaker 2>There was always catch wrestling,</v>

3904
01:53:51.121 --> 01:53:53.250
<v Speaker 2>which not a lot of great submissions that are still to this day,</v>

3905
01:53:53.251 --> 01:53:55.380
<v Speaker 2>but to put it all together like,</v>

3906
01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:59.310
<v Speaker 2>like Leo did and Carlos and all the Gracie clan.</v>

3907
01:53:59.770 --> 01:54:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3908
01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:05.040
<v Speaker 2>what Brazil did for martial arts is probably one of the single most significant</v>

3909
01:54:05.041 --> 01:54:09.150
<v Speaker 2>things that's happened in the thousands of years of people fighting each other.</v>

3910
01:54:09.810 --> 01:54:10.643
<v Speaker 2>Pretty amazing,</v>

3911
01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:12.330
<v Speaker 2>pretty amazing.</v>

3912
01:54:12.330 --> 01:54:13.141
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>

3913
01:54:13.141 --> 01:54:14.640
<v Speaker 2>that was those guys who shoot your box,</v>

3914
01:54:14.670 --> 01:54:16.700
<v Speaker 2>just fucking eat and I shit out of each other.</v>

3915
01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:17.820
<v Speaker 2>I then this shit out of each other.</v>

3916
01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:20.850
<v Speaker 2>There was an article that I read recently where a vendor Larry was talking</v>

3917
01:54:20.851 --> 01:54:21.211
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

3918
01:54:21.211 --> 01:54:22.044
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3919
01:54:22.350 --> 01:54:23.183
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3920
01:54:23.250 --> 01:54:23.621
<v Speaker 2>he always,</v>

3921
01:54:23.621 --> 01:54:25.650
<v Speaker 2>he's having difficulty now because you know,</v>

3922
01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:27.510
<v Speaker 2>he's had so many wars.</v>

3923
01:54:27.511 --> 01:54:31.800
<v Speaker 2>He fought for so many years and that he went to some sort of a conference on a</v>

3924
01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:36.630
<v Speaker 2>concussions and CTE and he had 13 of the 15 symptoms.</v>

3925
01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3926
01:54:37.650 --> 01:54:38.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3927
01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3928
01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:39.990
<v Speaker 2>And he was talking about,</v>

3929
01:54:39.991 --> 01:54:41.430
<v Speaker 2>I forgets things is,</v>

3930
01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:42.750
<v Speaker 2>he's impulsive,</v>

3931
01:54:42.751 --> 01:54:44.510
<v Speaker 2>all these different symptoms yet.</v>

3932
01:54:44.670 --> 01:54:46.200
<v Speaker 2>And then the very next thing he said is,</v>

3933
01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:47.880
<v Speaker 2>but I want to fight Vito Belfort.</v>

3934
01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:52.420
<v Speaker 1>He's make it fun.</v>

3935
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:53.540
<v Speaker 1>The lace crazy.</v>

3936
01:54:53.541 --> 01:54:56.840
<v Speaker 1>He went to my dog show and he's crazy.</v>

3937
01:54:57.410 --> 01:55:01.850
<v Speaker 1>He decided not to go like two minutes before he goes and has changed his mind</v>

3938
01:55:01.851 --> 01:55:02.930
<v Speaker 1>and he's sweet,</v>

3939
01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:03.793
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

3940
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:05.270
<v Speaker 1>his right wing now,</v>

3941
01:55:05.271 --> 01:55:06.104
<v Speaker 1>he was just,</v>

3942
01:55:07.070 --> 01:55:08.030
<v Speaker 1>he tried to go,</v>

3943
01:55:08.031 --> 01:55:09.350
<v Speaker 1>he became a politician.</v>

3944
01:55:09.550 --> 01:55:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

3945
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:11.150
<v Speaker 1>He went to be a lack that,</v>

3946
01:55:11.151 --> 01:55:11.720
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

3947
01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:12.560
<v Speaker 1>nobody voted.</v>

3948
01:55:12.570 --> 01:55:14.630
<v Speaker 1>And who just liked him?</v>

3949
01:55:14.631 --> 01:55:14.991
<v Speaker 1>People didn't,</v>

3950
01:55:14.991 --> 01:55:17.360
<v Speaker 1>no one can you see on like Congress or so that's good.</v>

3951
01:55:17.361 --> 01:55:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Brazil gets it in America.</v>

3952
01:55:19.130 --> 01:55:19.841
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous.</v>

3953
01:55:19.841 --> 01:55:22.910
<v Speaker 1>It happens in Brazil to have celebrities.</v>

3954
01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:25.573
<v Speaker 1>One of our,</v>

3955
01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:26.180
<v Speaker 1>one of our,</v>

3956
01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:27.013
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3957
01:55:27.290 --> 01:55:29.770
<v Speaker 1>one of our most famous congressman's,</v>

3958
01:55:29.771 --> 01:55:31.040
<v Speaker 1>it was a big brother.</v>

3959
01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

3960
01:55:32.511 --> 01:55:35.510
<v Speaker 1>that was a big brother and big brother shows so ridiculous.</v>

3961
01:55:35.530 --> 01:55:37.610
<v Speaker 1>He has the worst way to become a celebrity.</v>

3962
01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:40.820
<v Speaker 1>One of the most watched shows in Brazil.</v>

3963
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:41.900
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3964
01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I know people that much he had to do.</v>

3965
01:55:44.150 --> 01:55:45.710
<v Speaker 2>They don't know anymore.</v>

3966
01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:47.150
<v Speaker 2>They still think so for sure.</v>

3967
01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:51.150
<v Speaker 2>The crazy thing was Amarosa Amarosa who was one of the big,</v>

3968
01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:51.851
<v Speaker 2>she was a,</v>

3969
01:55:51.851 --> 01:55:56.520
<v Speaker 2>a big stash was the White House brand is before that she was on fear factor.</v>

3970
01:55:56.850 --> 01:55:58.710
<v Speaker 2>I when I was the host,</v>

3971
01:55:58.711 --> 01:56:01.890
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know I had a fucking altercation with her on fear factor.</v>

3972
01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:02.791
<v Speaker 2>Not a bad one,</v>

3973
01:56:02.791 --> 01:56:04.350
<v Speaker 2>but she keeps me being drunk.</v>

3974
01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:05.341
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

3975
01:56:05.341 --> 01:56:07.110
<v Speaker 2>cause I was asking her questions like that doesn't make sense.</v>

3976
01:56:07.111 --> 01:56:07.531
<v Speaker 2>She was choked.</v>

3977
01:56:07.531 --> 01:56:08.011
<v Speaker 2>You're drunk.</v>

3978
01:56:08.011 --> 01:56:08.251
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3979
01:56:08.251 --> 01:56:10.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not drunk or you can't just say I'm drunk.</v>

3980
01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:13.920
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't even thinking of this fear before the apprentice.</v>

3981
01:56:13.950 --> 01:56:14.191
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3982
01:56:14.191 --> 01:56:17.340
<v Speaker 2>she was on something else first before the apprentice.</v>

3983
01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:18.863
<v Speaker 2>I think that was it.</v>

3984
01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Was she on the apprentice and then fear factor come on.</v>

3985
01:56:22.250 --> 01:56:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Was fear factor before the apprentice the same time.</v>

3986
01:56:25.001 --> 01:56:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Just before she got famous for being on the apprentice.</v>

3987
01:56:27.450 --> 01:56:29.040
<v Speaker 2>She was on like the second season maybe.</v>

3988
01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3989
01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I really did.</v>

3990
01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:34.260
<v Speaker 2>I think she was on another show first and then the apprentice,</v>

3991
01:56:34.530 --> 01:56:37.050
<v Speaker 2>she went to another reality show after dip brand is,</v>

3992
01:56:37.051 --> 01:56:39.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who I remember that.</v>

3993
01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3994
01:56:39.630 --> 01:56:39.931
<v Speaker 2>I bought,</v>

3995
01:56:39.931 --> 01:56:43.980
<v Speaker 2>the crazy thing is she went from the White House to big brother because she was</v>

3996
01:56:43.981 --> 01:56:45.780
<v Speaker 2>actually on the first season of the apprentice.</v>

3997
01:56:45.850 --> 01:56:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3998
01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:47.613
<v Speaker 2>what year was that?</v>

3999
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4000
01:56:50.330 --> 01:56:52.890
<v Speaker 2>so she was on celebrity fear factor.</v>

4001
01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:55.480
<v Speaker 2>We had a three to four.</v>

4002
01:56:55.530 --> 01:56:55.771
<v Speaker 2>Three.</v>

4003
01:56:55.771 --> 01:56:56.101
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4004
01:56:56.101 --> 01:56:58.650
<v Speaker 2>So she must've been on fear factor like 2005.</v>

4005
01:56:59.320 --> 01:56:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

4006
01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:00.653
<v Speaker 2>she's nice though.</v>

4007
01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:01.493
<v Speaker 2>She's just,</v>

4008
01:57:01.590 --> 01:57:03.210
<v Speaker 2>but she was just told me I was drunk.</v>

4009
01:57:03.211 --> 01:57:03.511
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4010
01:57:03.511 --> 01:57:04.050
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

4011
01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:05.220
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't elected.</v>

4012
01:57:05.221 --> 01:57:06.054
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4013
01:57:06.090 --> 01:57:08.580
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't like she was appointed by Trump,</v>

4014
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:09.930
<v Speaker 2>but Trump gave,</v>

4015
01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:11.130
<v Speaker 2>so here's what's fucked up.</v>

4016
01:57:11.490 --> 01:57:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's really,</v>

4017
01:57:12.650 --> 01:57:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I was reading an article about the,</v>

4018
01:57:14.131 --> 01:57:19.131
<v Speaker 2>what the problems with what she did when she was in the situation room and these</v>

4019
01:57:20.190 --> 01:57:21.510
<v Speaker 2>secured White House rooms.</v>

4020
01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:24.120
<v Speaker 2>She had her fucking phone recording.</v>

4021
01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:28.200
<v Speaker 2>So she's sitting there recording shit in the middle of these,</v>

4022
01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:32.370
<v Speaker 2>these like totally secure rooms.</v>

4023
01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:33.740
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

4024
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Trump is talking,</v>

4025
01:57:34.651 --> 01:57:35.430
<v Speaker 2>she's got her phone there.</v>

4026
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

4027
01:57:35.970 --> 01:57:36.803
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

4028
01:57:37.230 --> 01:57:39.200
<v Speaker 2>And she's recording everything on her fucking fault.</v>

4029
01:57:39.201 --> 01:57:43.350
<v Speaker 2>And she has like hours and hours of footage of record recordings rather,</v>

4030
01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:45.270
<v Speaker 2>which you're not supposed to do.</v>

4031
01:57:45.271 --> 01:57:50.271
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can literally Russians and Chinese and the Iranians and all the</v>

4032
01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:55.260
<v Speaker 2>anybody that wants to tune in could hack into her fucking phone,</v>

4033
01:57:55.410 --> 01:57:59.880
<v Speaker 2>turn the microphone on and this is absolute proven technology and they're using</v>

4034
01:57:59.881 --> 01:58:02.580
<v Speaker 2>that to listen in the middle of the situation room.</v>

4035
01:58:02.581 --> 01:58:05.550
<v Speaker 2>So if there's some sort of top secret shit that's going on,</v>

4036
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:09.970
<v Speaker 2>some foreign entity could be listening in through her phone while she's</v>

4037
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.650
<v Speaker 2>recording.</v>

4038
01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:11.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they see the ignorant.</v>

4039
01:58:11.911 --> 01:58:12.840
<v Speaker 2>I think they need all of that.</v>

4040
01:58:12.841 --> 01:58:14.520
<v Speaker 2>There's just called Trump and ask what happened?</v>

4041
01:58:15.710 --> 01:58:16.990
<v Speaker 2>They'll tell you if like what happened.</v>

4042
01:58:16.991 --> 01:58:17.641
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4043
01:58:17.641 --> 01:58:18.474
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

4044
01:58:18.570 --> 01:58:19.500
<v Speaker 2>But I mean he's,</v>

4045
01:58:20.010 --> 01:58:21.660
<v Speaker 2>he allowed her this,</v>

4046
01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:22.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4047
01:58:22.471 --> 01:58:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if she's unstable,</v>

4048
01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:26.450
<v Speaker 2>but she seems a little unstable to,</v>

4049
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:29.490
<v Speaker 2>that's a such a very dangerous thing to do.</v>

4050
01:58:29.491 --> 01:58:33.000
<v Speaker 2>You're not even supposed to bring your fucking phone in those rooms and for her</v>

4051
01:58:33.001 --> 01:58:33.990
<v Speaker 2>to be recording,</v>

4052
01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:35.220
<v Speaker 2>recording everything.</v>

4053
01:58:35.221 --> 01:58:35.730
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

4054
01:58:35.730 --> 01:58:37.170
<v Speaker 2>This is so crazy,</v>

4055
01:58:37.740 --> 01:58:41.380
<v Speaker 2>but so selfish to like if you are acting in the best,</v>

4056
01:58:41.410 --> 01:58:43.480
<v Speaker 2>you're in a position when you work for the White House,</v>

4057
01:58:43.481 --> 01:58:44.800
<v Speaker 2>you're working for Donald Trump.</v>

4058
01:58:44.801 --> 01:58:46.720
<v Speaker 2>He is the president of the United States,</v>

4059
01:58:46.721 --> 01:58:51.070
<v Speaker 2>the biggest super power in the fucking world and you're just recording things.</v>

4060
01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:52.473
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

4061
01:58:52.930 --> 01:58:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I know that you want to serve yourself.</v>

4062
01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:56.470
<v Speaker 2>I know you want to help yourself out,</v>

4063
01:58:56.471 --> 01:58:57.640
<v Speaker 2>but God,</v>

4064
01:58:57.670 --> 01:58:59.110
<v Speaker 2>that seems so crazy.</v>

4065
01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:01.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you were trumping,</v>

4066
01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:04.360
<v Speaker 2>you hired her and you found out she was recording everything in the situation</v>

4067
01:59:04.361 --> 01:59:04.481
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

4068
01:59:04.481 --> 01:59:05.314
<v Speaker 2>you must be like,</v>

4069
01:59:06.370 --> 01:59:07.240
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4070
01:59:07.330 --> 01:59:11.950
<v Speaker 2>like in conferences with like they're talking about important policy and she's</v>

4071
01:59:11.951 --> 01:59:15.880
<v Speaker 2>got a phone recording and anybody can be listening and if you think about it</v>

4072
01:59:15.881 --> 01:59:18.590
<v Speaker 2>like it's crazy for him to,</v>

4073
01:59:19.290 --> 01:59:23.380
<v Speaker 2>to give her some some credibility because she wasn't apprentice.</v>

4074
01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:23.641
<v Speaker 2>He liked,</v>

4075
01:59:23.641 --> 01:59:24.341
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think about it.</v>

4076
01:59:24.341 --> 01:59:24.581
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4077
01:59:24.581 --> 01:59:27.370
<v Speaker 2>The president of the United States is the guys that was running a premise.</v>

4078
01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:29.920
<v Speaker 2>He liked her.</v>

4079
01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'll look.</v>

4080
01:59:31.150 --> 01:59:32.470
<v Speaker 2>She's very articulate.</v>

4081
01:59:32.530 --> 01:59:33.790
<v Speaker 2>She's good looking woman.</v>

4082
01:59:33.791 --> 01:59:35.110
<v Speaker 2>She knows how to speak well.</v>

4083
01:59:35.290 --> 01:59:37.060
<v Speaker 2>She's got a lot of confidence and power.</v>

4084
01:59:37.061 --> 01:59:38.800
<v Speaker 2>He probably figured she'd be a great politician.</v>

4085
01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:39.581
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

4086
01:59:39.581 --> 01:59:40.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm a great politician.</v>

4087
01:59:40.601 --> 01:59:41.051
<v Speaker 2>He's probably like,</v>

4088
01:59:41.051 --> 01:59:42.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm the fucking president.</v>

4089
01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I'll make her,</v>

4090
01:59:42.970 --> 01:59:46.060
<v Speaker 2>she'll say she's going to be my left hand lady or right hand lady.</v>

4091
01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:47.530
<v Speaker 2>And it's not that it that difficult,</v>

4092
01:59:47.531 --> 01:59:50.830
<v Speaker 2>but at least in Brazil is not that difficult for our famous people to get</v>

4093
01:59:50.831 --> 01:59:55.090
<v Speaker 2>elected in the one day where I was running for a congressman because there's so</v>

4094
01:59:55.091 --> 02:00:00.091
<v Speaker 2>many options and if you are known and you'll get like 1% of the voting,</v>

4095
02:00:00.130 --> 02:00:01.300
<v Speaker 2>you're already elected.</v>

4096
02:00:01.690 --> 02:00:06.690
<v Speaker 2>But if you go run for like a mayor or governor or glove and there are some,</v>

4097
02:00:06.891 --> 02:00:10.030
<v Speaker 2>he becomes a little trickier because there's like five options and now you're</v>

4098
02:00:10.031 --> 02:00:11.740
<v Speaker 2>running against real politics,</v>

4099
02:00:11.741 --> 02:00:13.630
<v Speaker 2>real politicians who actually have a plan.</v>

4100
02:00:14.050 --> 02:00:16.090
<v Speaker 2>So we feel running out guys like 200 people.</v>

4101
02:00:16.091 --> 02:00:18.340
<v Speaker 2>You can shine Oviedo because you're famous.</v>

4102
02:00:18.500 --> 02:00:19.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4103
02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:21.360
<v Speaker 2>We're starting to see a little bit more than America.</v>

4104
02:00:21.370 --> 02:00:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Like Cynthia Nixon.</v>

4105
02:00:22.331 --> 02:00:26.530
<v Speaker 2>She was on sex in the city and then she ran for which he ran for governor in New</v>

4106
02:00:26.530 --> 02:00:26.900
<v Speaker 2>York,</v>

4107
02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:27.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4108
02:00:27.190 --> 02:00:27.651
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4109
02:00:27.651 --> 02:00:27.971
<v Speaker 2>Go for it.</v>

4110
02:00:27.971 --> 02:00:28.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4111
02:00:28.241 --> 02:00:28.630
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

4112
02:00:28.630 --> 02:00:32.320
<v Speaker 2>there's a few that few that are starting to branch off into politics now.</v>

4113
02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:33.750
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4114
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4115
02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:36.190
<v Speaker 2>did it happen before Ronald Reagan because he was like,</v>

4116
02:00:36.191 --> 02:00:36.301
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4117
02:00:36.301 --> 02:00:36.970
<v Speaker 2>he's famous.</v>

4118
02:00:36.970 --> 02:00:38.020
<v Speaker 2>He's the most famous,</v>

4119
02:00:38.050 --> 02:00:38.321
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

4120
02:00:38.321 --> 02:00:39.850
<v Speaker 2>I think he was a movie star.</v>

4121
02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:40.750
<v Speaker 2>He was a big bang,</v>

4122
02:00:40.751 --> 02:00:41.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4123
02:00:41.050 --> 02:00:41.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4124
02:00:41.291 --> 02:00:43.420
<v Speaker 2>He was the first guy back to the future.</v>

4125
02:00:43.421 --> 02:00:44.400
<v Speaker 2>You mean like Ronald Reagan,</v>

4126
02:00:44.410 --> 02:00:45.570
<v Speaker 2>the movie star and like,</v>

4127
02:00:45.590 --> 02:00:46.423
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4128
02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:47.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4129
02:00:47.921 --> 02:00:48.611
<v Speaker 2>That was a,</v>

4130
02:00:48.611 --> 02:00:49.421
<v Speaker 2>that was the first.</v>

4131
02:00:49.421 --> 02:00:49.931
<v Speaker 2>He was the first,</v>

4132
02:00:49.931 --> 02:00:52.990
<v Speaker 2>he was also the first that introduced the option or his,</v>

4133
02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:54.430
<v Speaker 2>his cabinet was the first.</v>

4134
02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:57.670
<v Speaker 2>They got the people that his,</v>

4135
02:00:57.730 --> 02:01:00.970
<v Speaker 2>his team got the people from the religious right.</v>

4136
02:01:00.971 --> 02:01:01.804
<v Speaker 2>Involved.</v>

4137
02:01:01.870 --> 02:01:06.870
<v Speaker 2>Religion was not really a big part of voting before Ronald Reagan and Ronald</v>

4138
02:01:06.910 --> 02:01:06.911
<v Speaker 2>Reagan.</v>

4139
02:01:06.911 --> 02:01:10.090
<v Speaker 2>And though that sort of kind of Republican,</v>

4140
02:01:10.091 --> 02:01:12.880
<v Speaker 2>they got all these event gelical Christians and evangelicals.</v>

4141
02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:13.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4142
02:01:13.541 --> 02:01:14.120
<v Speaker 2>And the same thing,</v>

4143
02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:14.953
<v Speaker 2>Brazil,</v>

4144
02:01:15.370 --> 02:01:17.650
<v Speaker 2>what is going on with Brazil now with your president?</v>

4145
02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:18.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4146
02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:22.020
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge connection between politics and the church right now.</v>

4147
02:01:22.250 --> 02:01:23.980
<v Speaker 2>The genetical and it wasn't that way before.</v>

4148
02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:25.120
<v Speaker 2>He was a little bit,</v>

4149
02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:29.170
<v Speaker 2>he was always something because Brazil is a very evangelical country.</v>

4150
02:01:29.190 --> 02:01:29.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4151
02:01:29.710 --> 02:01:30.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't really feel have a wash.</v>

4152
02:01:30.890 --> 02:01:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Luckily we were watching it the middle of the night,</v>

4153
02:01:32.651 --> 02:01:35.170
<v Speaker 2>they do turn on your TV and there's this guy talking to,</v>

4155
02:01:36.190 --> 02:01:36.401
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4156
02:01:36.401 --> 02:01:39.680
<v Speaker 2>there's a demon that is running over my soul.</v>

4157
02:01:39.681 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 2>And there's</v>

4158
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:45.130
<v Speaker 1>like those TV shows called stop suffering by the Sofrito is more like for those</v>

4159
02:01:47.670 --> 02:01:48.970
<v Speaker 1>of the [inaudible].</v>

4160
02:01:49.090 --> 02:01:50.600
<v Speaker 1>This church is everywhere.</v>

4161
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:51.400
<v Speaker 1>So EDC,</v>

4162
02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Joel Olsteen in America,</v>

4163
02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:56.330
<v Speaker 1>he's a big time of evangelical Christian.</v>

4164
02:01:56.331 --> 02:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>He sells out these giant arenas,</v>

4165
02:01:58.191 --> 02:01:59.440
<v Speaker 1>like 50,000 pizzas.</v>

4166
02:01:59.441 --> 02:01:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Come to see him.</v>

4167
02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

4168
02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:00.831
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

4169
02:02:00.831 --> 02:02:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4170
02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>But he's very,</v>

4171
02:02:02.450 --> 02:02:03.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4172
02:02:03.170 --> 02:02:03.531
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4173
02:02:03.531 --> 02:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4174
02:02:04.130 --> 02:02:07.100
<v Speaker 1>it's huge in Brazil and they have like,</v>

4175
02:02:07.101 --> 02:02:07.371
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

4176
02:02:07.371 --> 02:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>40% of the people is evangelical in Brazil.</v>

4177
02:02:10.101 --> 02:02:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the numbers right now,</v>

4178
02:02:11.421 --> 02:02:12.410
<v Speaker 1>but the church,</v>

4179
02:02:12.650 --> 02:02:13.251
<v Speaker 1>the religious,</v>

4180
02:02:13.251 --> 02:02:14.420
<v Speaker 1>something huge over there.</v>

4181
02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:15.980
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4182
02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:16.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4183
02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:17.990
<v Speaker 1>he was something,</v>

4184
02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>that's why we didn't evolve in a lot of different discussions.</v>

4185
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Like talking about abortion is now legal in Brazil.</v>

4186
02:02:26.150 --> 02:02:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Not Legal at all.</v>

4187
02:02:27.021 --> 02:02:27.151
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4188
02:02:27.151 --> 02:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>they got all.</v>

4189
02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4190
02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Just if you're raped,</v>

4191
02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:30.671
<v Speaker 1>Jesse,</v>

4192
02:02:30.671 --> 02:02:35.671
<v Speaker 1>if you raped or if your kid has like a deformity deformity,</v>

4193
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:39.290
<v Speaker 1>then you can have an abortion.</v>

4194
02:02:39.291 --> 02:02:40.460
<v Speaker 1>The woman's life is threatened.</v>

4195
02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:41.293
<v Speaker 1>He had a bird.</v>

4196
02:02:41.690 --> 02:02:43.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the only cases.</v>

4197
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:45.470
<v Speaker 1>And that discussion was never,</v>

4198
02:02:45.650 --> 02:02:48.140
<v Speaker 1>never happened because everybody's religious.</v>

4199
02:02:48.290 --> 02:02:50.270
<v Speaker 1>If you do like a,</v>

4200
02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:53.630
<v Speaker 1>how do you say when you go public and you ask something to the people,</v>

4201
02:02:54.050 --> 02:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4202
02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:55.490
<v Speaker 1>do you have this here?</v>

4203
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:58.850
<v Speaker 1>It's just like you have a kind of a test.</v>

4204
02:02:58.880 --> 02:02:59.840
<v Speaker 1>We have this in Brazil.</v>

4205
02:03:00.070 --> 02:03:00.421
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4206
02:03:00.421 --> 02:03:02.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to say this in English,</v>

4207
02:03:02.031 --> 02:03:02.864
<v Speaker 1>but test.</v>

4208
02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:03.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4209
02:03:03.081 --> 02:03:03.914
<v Speaker 1>it's just a test.</v>

4210
02:03:03.980 --> 02:03:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Are you against abortion or pole?</v>

4211
02:03:06.770 --> 02:03:07.640
<v Speaker 1>A pole pole.</v>

4212
02:03:07.670 --> 02:03:07.911
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4213
02:03:07.911 --> 02:03:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Like an opinion poll.</v>

4214
02:03:09.670 --> 02:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>My second language.</v>

4215
02:03:10.810 --> 02:03:12.650
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes me miss a word or two.</v>

4216
02:03:12.910 --> 02:03:14.570
<v Speaker 1>I said that's my only language.</v>

4217
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:18.500
<v Speaker 1>So if you do a poll in Brazil,</v>

4218
02:03:18.501 --> 02:03:20.410
<v Speaker 1>people would be against abortion.</v>

4219
02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Like he's the legalization of abortion and against drugs like sex and drugs and</v>

4220
02:03:25.011 --> 02:03:25.281
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

4221
02:03:25.281 --> 02:03:26.090
<v Speaker 1>I what about um,</v>

4222
02:03:26.090 --> 02:03:27.200
<v Speaker 1>morning after pill?</v>

4223
02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:28.641
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4224
02:03:28.641 --> 02:03:29.240
<v Speaker 1>now it is.</v>

4225
02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:30.260
<v Speaker 1>You can take that.</v>

4226
02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:31.123
<v Speaker 1>You can't take that.</v>

4227
02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:32.473
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

4228
02:03:32.930 --> 02:03:33.501
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

4229
02:03:33.501 --> 02:03:34.100
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

4230
02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:34.933
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

4231
02:03:35.390 --> 02:03:36.380
<v Speaker 1>I bought some,</v>

4232
02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:41.030
<v Speaker 1>so I did it in pharmacy.</v>

4233
02:03:41.031 --> 02:03:42.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's okay.</v>

4234
02:03:42.740 --> 02:03:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

4235
02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:44.293
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

4236
02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:45.290
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

4237
02:03:45.290 --> 02:03:45.921
<v Speaker 1>but you can,</v>

4238
02:03:45.921 --> 02:03:47.400
<v Speaker 1>a abortion is not legal members,</v>

4239
02:03:47.430 --> 02:03:47.900
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4240
02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:52.010
<v Speaker 1>So we are not having that discussion because now the precedence is connected to</v>

4241
02:03:52.011 --> 02:03:52.844
<v Speaker 1>the church.</v>

4242
02:03:53.090 --> 02:03:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Our ex-president called Lula,</v>

4243
02:03:55.190 --> 02:03:56.780
<v Speaker 1>he's in jail right now.</v>

4244
02:03:57.500 --> 02:03:58.340
<v Speaker 1>He's in jail,</v>

4245
02:03:58.420 --> 02:03:58.940
<v Speaker 1>was in jail.</v>

4246
02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:02.690
<v Speaker 1>He was involved in the huge corruption scandal scandal.</v>

4247
02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:07.040
<v Speaker 1>And he was like our hope cause he was a poor guy.</v>

4248
02:04:07.220 --> 02:04:11.270
<v Speaker 1>So he was a government that actually help the poor in Brazil.</v>

4249
02:04:11.810 --> 02:04:12.770
<v Speaker 1>What happened with him?</v>

4250
02:04:12.771 --> 02:04:13.220
<v Speaker 1>What was,</v>

4251
02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:14.750
<v Speaker 1>he was involved the,</v>

4252
02:04:14.751 --> 02:04:15.584
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

4253
02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:19.250
<v Speaker 1>he had connections with different companies and different,</v>

4254
02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:20.113
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4255
02:04:20.370 --> 02:04:20.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4256
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:25.390
<v Speaker 1>industries was giving him money and they have this thing called Casha.</v>

4257
02:04:25.391 --> 02:04:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Dubois is when you're doing your campaign,</v>

4258
02:04:28.850 --> 02:04:33.320
<v Speaker 1>you need to say how much money you're getting from all those different brands</v>

4259
02:04:33.321 --> 02:04:34.154
<v Speaker 1>and everything.</v>

4260
02:04:34.670 --> 02:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>So there's thing called [inaudible],</v>

4261
02:04:36.410 --> 02:04:37.580
<v Speaker 1>which is you money.</v>

4262
02:04:37.581 --> 02:04:38.610
<v Speaker 1>It was spend the money.</v>

4263
02:04:38.630 --> 02:04:41.880
<v Speaker 1>There's never went on any banks or anything like that.</v>

4264
02:04:42.090 --> 02:04:43.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of a u high,</v>

4265
02:04:43.771 --> 02:04:45.970
<v Speaker 1>that money that will had,</v>

4266
02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:47.220
<v Speaker 1>that happens a lot in Brazil.</v>

4267
02:04:47.221 --> 02:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to say this in English,</v>

4268
02:04:48.751 --> 02:04:52.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that you hide the money that you're getting for a company,</v>

4269
02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:53.940
<v Speaker 1>but if you get elected,</v>

4270
02:04:53.970 --> 02:04:55.950
<v Speaker 1>you kind of forgive them favors.</v>

4271
02:04:56.400 --> 02:05:00.030
<v Speaker 1>You'll help them to get like a involved in a construct,</v>

4272
02:05:00.031 --> 02:05:01.310
<v Speaker 1>in a huge construction.</v>

4273
02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:02.550
<v Speaker 1>They are going to build a stadium.</v>

4274
02:05:02.551 --> 02:05:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Then you help them somehow.</v>

4275
02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:05.490
<v Speaker 1>That was what happened in,</v>

4276
02:05:05.491 --> 02:05:06.121
<v Speaker 1>in Brazil.</v>

4277
02:05:06.121 --> 02:05:06.990
<v Speaker 1>So he's in jail now.</v>

4278
02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:09.180
<v Speaker 1>He's in jail and then he,</v>

4279
02:05:09.181 --> 02:05:12.930
<v Speaker 1>he elected a woman in Brazil and she was impeached.</v>

4280
02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:14.213
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

4281
02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:18.150
<v Speaker 1>And now we have this right wing guy called Bull Sonato.</v>

4282
02:05:18.180 --> 02:05:23.180
<v Speaker 1>He's our new president and a a very right wing and connected to the army and</v>

4283
02:05:24.481 --> 02:05:25.710
<v Speaker 1>connected to the church.</v>

4284
02:05:25.710 --> 02:05:30.000
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of discussions and abortion and drugs and everything that we</v>

4285
02:05:30.001 --> 02:05:31.590
<v Speaker 1>are not going to have Susie popular.</v>

4286
02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:32.090
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

4287
02:05:32.090 --> 02:05:32.450
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

4288
02:05:32.450 --> 02:05:33.283
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4289
02:05:33.570 --> 02:05:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Is he popular and also like hated emails on a lot as well.</v>

4290
02:05:38.461 --> 02:05:39.294
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4291
02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:39.931
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

4292
02:05:39.931 --> 02:05:41.490
<v Speaker 1>There's the left hate the guy.</v>

4293
02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:43.830
<v Speaker 1>It does things that he's sad.</v>

4294
02:05:43.831 --> 02:05:44.490
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

4295
02:05:44.490 --> 02:05:46.050
<v Speaker 1>he was kind of crazy.</v>

4296
02:05:46.051 --> 02:05:47.370
<v Speaker 1>But you're not people.</v>

4297
02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:48.050
<v Speaker 1>People love you.</v>

4298
02:05:48.050 --> 02:05:49.230
<v Speaker 1>And how long has he been the president of?</v>

4299
02:05:49.231 --> 02:05:50.340
<v Speaker 1>He was going to be for 40 years,</v>

4300
02:05:50.341 --> 02:05:51.180
<v Speaker 1>so he was just selected.</v>

4301
02:05:51.181 --> 02:05:52.470
<v Speaker 1>He started January.</v>

4302
02:05:52.650 --> 02:05:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4303
02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:54.033
<v Speaker 1>Just started,</v>

4304
02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:54.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4305
02:05:54.391 --> 02:05:56.490
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what this is going to lead us,</v>

4306
02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:00.780
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is at the same time he's more liberal because the left in Brazil,</v>

4307
02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:05.310
<v Speaker 1>all this talk about feeding off speech and everything else was in our left was</v>

4308
02:06:05.311 --> 02:06:06.210
<v Speaker 1>running the country.</v>

4309
02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Now we got this guy and he is more Libero and even talking about the way he's</v>

4310
02:06:12.511 --> 02:06:13.300
<v Speaker 1>going to run the country,</v>

4311
02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:16.740
<v Speaker 1>the economy and politics and speech and everything else.</v>

4312
02:06:16.741 --> 02:06:19.590
<v Speaker 1>So there's a little hope in their areas as well.</v>

4313
02:06:19.890 --> 02:06:24.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of tricky because it's a danger in one area and it's kind of a hope</v>

4314
02:06:25.751 --> 02:06:26.584
<v Speaker 1>in another one.</v>

4315
02:06:26.850 --> 02:06:28.290
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was saying this in Portuguese.</v>

4316
02:06:28.291 --> 02:06:29.430
<v Speaker 1>It will be so much easier,</v>

4317
02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:30.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4318
02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:33.240
<v Speaker 1>even imagine can understand cause it's like an understanding.</v>

02:06:34.390 --> 02:06:35.230
