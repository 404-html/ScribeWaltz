1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.310
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.480
<v Speaker 1>here's the whole thing about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>holistic stuff for me and it's sort of</v>

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>the wisdom of the Orient and all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of bullshit.</v>

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>To me it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a real problem,</v>

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>then it'll cure whatever your non real</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is.</v>

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>If your real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just some sort of fatigue that's</v>

8
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:27.561
<v Speaker 1>based on depression or d or based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's going on emotionally in</v>

9
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically it's living in your head,</v>

10
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 1>but you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my joints ache and I have trouble</v>

11
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>getting out of bed and I give you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>magic pill that has a little bit of</v>

12
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>whisker of the cat and it then that'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>work on you.</v>

13
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Now if you got a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a podcast with a guy named Brian.</v>

14
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Brian has a tumor on his brainstem and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a real problem that's a</v>

15
00:00:55.411 --> 00:01:00.411
<v Speaker 1>different problem and he takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication that stops the growth of</v>

16
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that tumor,</v>

17
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>it was experimental at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if that tumor grows,</v>

18
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>then he's dead within six months and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>started years old.</v>

19
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>So when you have a tumor on the base of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your spine or the top of your spine and</v>

20
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>the base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain,</v>

21
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>that's an operable whisker of the cat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fucking hair,</v>

22
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>the newt</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not going to fucking heel that shit</v>

23
00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:27.070
<v Speaker 1>for you</v>

24
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.370
<v Speaker 2>rhino horn for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

25
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.100
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

26
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.680
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a real problem,</v>

27
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 2>that's the best combination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the best comparison rather is Rhino</v>

28
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.480
<v Speaker 2>Horn versus Cialis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

29
00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:41.980
<v Speaker 2>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

30
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 2>only works in your mind and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

31
00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:48.910
<v Speaker 2>I feel more viral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other one gives you a steel rod</v>

32
00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 2>and your pants for a solid day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

33
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.660
<v Speaker 2>You have a choice whether you want to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Voodoo or that little blue thing.</v>

34
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rhino Horn should be a strap on</v>

35
00:01:58.131 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Rhino Horn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should get the whole horn.</v>

36
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Forget about grinding it up into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking powder and putting in your</v>

37
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:05.480
<v Speaker 1>teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give me the whole fucking horn.</v>

38
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll put a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Bob bicycle inner tube around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrapper once around the Pauls and nail</v>

41
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:14.390
<v Speaker 1>over the fucking horn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine</v>

42
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.760
<v Speaker 2>how horrible it would be if men had hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>ons all the time,</v>

43
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:20.520
<v Speaker 2>like a horn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a biological process that you</v>

44
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 2>had to like engage in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All factors have to be right and</v>

45
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 2>anything that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>

46
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 2>boner shuts down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk debono shuts down.</v>

47
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 2>All these things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your bonus shuts down the complex</v>

48
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:33.390
<v Speaker 2>biological process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the erection.</v>

49
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 2>If we just had a rhino horn and we could</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fuck all the time,</v>

50
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 2>what a wreck it would be on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone would have callous dicks.</v>

51
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 2>We'd have like caked calluses all around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outsides of our dicks.</v>

52
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know all these places instead of</v>

53
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Manny petty places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>places that would remove the cows is so</v>

54
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:51.010
<v Speaker 2>you could enjoy pleasure with you dick.</v>

55
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to step up your</v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalyptic boner future nightmare</v>

56
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fucking turn one up to 11</v>

57
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>then imagine if there were bone</v>
<v Speaker 1>poachers.</v>

58
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

59
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guy and uh,</v>

60
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Japan wants to make some soup at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogan's cock cause he thinks it's going</v>

61
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.180
<v Speaker 1>to make his cock harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

62
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Rogan's a virile guy send to the MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the next thing you know,</v>

63
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>you've got to look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking over your shoulder</v>

64
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>because there's some dude and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know if he's a game warden or she's on</v>

65
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>your side or their side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every time the sun goes down,</v>

66
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>you've got to worry about the cock</v>
<v Speaker 1>poachers.</v>

67
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine there is no way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow your duck could like,</v>

68
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine if the only way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow your Dick would be sucking dicks?</v>

69
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to run around and suck as</v>
<v Speaker 1>many dicks as possible to get your dick</v>

70
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't work.</v>

71
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.040
<v Speaker 1>So girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know you pull your pants up,</v>

72
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>she'd look at your deck and she would</v>
<v Speaker 1>know for a fact,</v>

73
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great dick.</v>

74
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 1>But this guy most likely sucked a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cox to get that Dick so big.</v>

75
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you'd have to explain that</v>

76
00:03:56.081 --> 00:04:00.400
<v Speaker 1>that's just a sort of born this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's gift.</v>

77
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Your Dad and Grandpa have huge Cox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never suck.</v>

78
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Cock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe when you wouldn't want to protest</v>

79
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll have to lie about it a little</v>

80
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any builders and steroids.</v>

81
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the chick would a assume</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

82
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:18.121
<v Speaker 1>but it would be an interesting thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out a survey of straight guys,</v>

83
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>which is if you could grow your cock by</v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking cock,</v>

84
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 1>would you be in and down for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be like how much does it grow</v>

85
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:28.250
<v Speaker 1>too?</v>

86
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Holy Shit.</v>

87
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>There'd be a long negotiation about</v>
<v Speaker 1>swallowing,</v>

88
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>about length,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about our we metric or standard.</v>

89
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Here we go and millimeters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We going by the inch.</v>

90
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 1>How do we do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say this and it was,</v>

91
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 1>everyone talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your Dick,</v>

92
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:47.490
<v Speaker 1>your Dick size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You measure the Dick caddy.</v>

93
00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Measure that Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say this,</v>

94
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.370
<v Speaker 1>it should be standardized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You measure your cock this way.</v>

95
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.980
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard it on Joe Rogan's show once</v>

96
00:04:55.981 --> 00:04:56.930
<v Speaker 1>and for all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

97
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.520
<v Speaker 1>The official way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use a cloth measuring tape,</v>

98
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.410
<v Speaker 1>center of the anus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watts.</v>

99
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Hear me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Center of the anus once around the balls</v>

100
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.280
<v Speaker 1>to just pass the tip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pass the test.</v>

101
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.680
<v Speaker 1>That's the official way I measure my</v>
<v Speaker 1>cock and I think it should be a standard</v>

102
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.560
<v Speaker 1>that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very generous of you.</v>

103
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the way you mess your car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard these supposed to measure</v>

104
00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:24.690
<v Speaker 1>from the bottom and I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

105
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows [inaudible] don't cheat it</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

106
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Go Center once around the balls just</v>
<v Speaker 1>passed the tip.</v>

107
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Cocker related.</v>

108
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me down with this.</v>

109
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

110
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>I've given this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of thought,</v>

111
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.030
<v Speaker 1>a lot more thought and then I'm really</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable admitting,</v>

112
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:51.031
<v Speaker 1>but I had this idea where we do a water</v>
<v Speaker 1>displacement test on every guy over 18</v>

113
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.220
<v Speaker 1>your hard cock into a graduated cylinder</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled to the top with water through</v>

114
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 1>just a very thin sheet of like stainless</v>
<v Speaker 1>steel,</v>

115
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>lower you down and we literally see how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much water's displaced by year.</v>

116
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Tumescent cock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

117
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this factors in girth and length and</v>

118
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:21.260
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so water should be a volume</v>

119
00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is water displacement.</v>

120
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once we do that,</v>

121
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.410
<v Speaker 1>we do it for every male in America over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of 18 you then are issued a</v>

122
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:36.110
<v Speaker 1>windbreaker.</v>

123
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.040
<v Speaker 1>That windbreaker has your ranking on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not how much water you displaced,</v>

124
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 1>not how big your cock is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But out of,</v>

125
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.960
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's a 100 million males</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are over the age of 18 and the</v>

126
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what place you come in,</v>

127
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a pretty fucking good</v>

128
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 1>windbreaker to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

129
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.810
<v Speaker 1>You'd also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody was in the top 10 would be</v>

130
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>making the fucking rounds on the late</v>
<v Speaker 1>night shows and each year,</v>

131
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two,</v>

132
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:15.641
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5 million guys turning 18 it all has to</v>

133
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 1>be recalibrated every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

134
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 1>you may see getting bigger if you saw a</v>
<v Speaker 1>graph of how big dicks used to be in the</v>

135
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.630
<v Speaker 1>20s and 2000 well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.451
<v Speaker 1>just if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

137
00:07:24.451 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 1>if people are getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

138
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Proportionately we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the point is this,</v>

139
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.040
<v Speaker 1>you may be number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's always some guy turning 18 I</v>

140
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:37.160
<v Speaker 1>mean there's a thousand guys just turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 the time I said that,</v>

141
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.580
<v Speaker 1>and they're getting tested and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big reveal and for one month everybody's</v>

142
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:46.340
<v Speaker 1>got to wear that windbreaker wherever</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

143
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.380
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

144
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 2>we're going to wear that thing for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>

145
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:51.830
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the rule.</v>

146
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.840
<v Speaker 2>2 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>999 billion.</v>

147
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.100
<v Speaker 2>It's starting at 100 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

148
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can be sure somebody is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be last.</v>

149
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's three,</v>

150
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.390
<v Speaker 2>150 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>300 million people in the country,</v>

151
00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:10.391
<v Speaker 2>so 150 million plus minus wrapped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you got to go 18 year old then</v>

152
00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:12.320
<v Speaker 2>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just call it 100 million</v>

153
00:08:12.321 --> 00:08:13.210
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

154
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.720
<v Speaker 2>And for my money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number one dude is going to do all</v>

155
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:19.970
<v Speaker 2>the late night shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the last dude,</v>

156
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 2>he's going to make the rounds to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one guy that has the biggest cock</v>

157
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he went to the Tsa,</v>

158
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he was wearing sweatpants and they</v>

159
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:29.960
<v Speaker 2>accused him of trying to smuggle</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

160
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.800
<v Speaker 2>The guy's got a giant hog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

161
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it was like all over these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

162
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 2>news reports and white guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pasty looking white guy.</v>

163
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his name is Jonah Falcon or</v>

164
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:42.480
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

165
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.350
<v Speaker 2>that's what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I saw a documentary or</v>

166
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember in the porn days,</v>

167
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 2>and it's not saying that John Holmes</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have a big Dick.</v>

168
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:52.160
<v Speaker 2>He definitely has a big Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But remember when we were kids,</v>

169
00:08:52.161 --> 00:08:54.410
<v Speaker 2>we'd watch porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you saw John Holmes,</v>

170
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:55.244
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy,</v>

171
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 2>that's a big Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joanna Falcon.</v>

172
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.010
<v Speaker 2>So sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frisked by TSA by the way,</v>

173
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.190
<v Speaker 2>don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ask me who the vice president is.</v>

174
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

175
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.280
<v Speaker 2>ah fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know it's going to be a history</v>

176
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 2>quiz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but big Cox,</v>

177
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking your man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Holmes used to have a giant deck</v>

178
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 2>right now that's like pretty standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of those guys with</v>

179
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 2>big giant dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually the black ones,</v>

180
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I got a theory about big giant</v>

181
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.090
<v Speaker 2>black dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God,</v>

182
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:29.700
<v Speaker 2>dovetails nicely into my windbreaker</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

183
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.860
<v Speaker 2>I got a theory about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

184
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is the following.</v>

185
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 2>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dare you be?</v>

186
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Smirch a good name of Johnny Wad home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause he did have a big deck.</v>

187
00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:47.530
<v Speaker 2>It was very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still Big by today's big Dick Stand and</v>

188
00:09:47.531 --> 00:09:48.364
<v Speaker 2>no doubt.</v>

189
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.420
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as black guys having big dicks in</v>

190
00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:58.680
<v Speaker 1>porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a form of porn racism.</v>

191
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you why.</v>

192
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.800
<v Speaker 1>I think if you show up onto a porn set</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a black guy with a medium sized cock</v>

193
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.710
<v Speaker 1>fair to Midland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

194
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.930
<v Speaker 1>you man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got six and a half inches here.</v>

195
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.790
<v Speaker 1>They send you a packet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

196
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:18.840
<v Speaker 1>we don't need black guys were small</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocks willingly black guys with big Cox.</v>

197
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.290
<v Speaker 1>We can take a white guy with a medium</v>
<v Speaker 1>cock,</v>

198
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.480
<v Speaker 1>but we can't take a black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

199
00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:27.780
<v Speaker 1>why bother getting fucked by a black guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the guy's got a medium cock?</v>

200
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.450
<v Speaker 1>You see what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're discriminated against.</v>

201
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:35.451
<v Speaker 1>So I think we think the only huge cock</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen is in porn.</v>

202
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:39.630
<v Speaker 1>It's on black guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't let average size cocked black</v>

203
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:44.631
<v Speaker 1>men in an I dream of a future where my</v>
<v Speaker 1>children can watch pornography and see</v>

204
00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:49.470
<v Speaker 1>black guys with medium sized Cox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:53.730
<v Speaker 1>balls deep in a junky coked up blinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

206
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

207
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:55.270
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

208
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

209
00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
