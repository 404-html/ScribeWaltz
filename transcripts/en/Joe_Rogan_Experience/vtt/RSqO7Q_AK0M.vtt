00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.413
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to do a lot of radio morning </v>

13
00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:49.990
<v Speaker 2>radio and getting up in the morning is </v>
<v Speaker 2>rough because then you try to take a nap</v>

14
00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:52.300
<v Speaker 2>and you always feel a little groggy </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the first show.</v>

<v Speaker 2>been in La and smoke a joint,</v>

17
00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:58.300
<v Speaker 2>get up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke a joint and,</v>

18
00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.283
<v Speaker 2>and always put on midnight rider always </v>
<v Speaker 2>for some reason because it was dark </v>

80
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Lastly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived there for awhile,</v>

81
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 2>but Florida back then nobody had figured</v>
<v Speaker 2>out the Florida socks.</v>

82
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 2>It was like Florida is the place to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get away from this fucking winter and</v>

83
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 2>they all go down there and then I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>move and then we realized like the dregs</v>

84
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 2>of the Weirdos.</v>

85
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember seeing if,</v>

86
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 2>if somebody had a tee shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I grew up in Louisiana.</v>

87
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 2>If somebody teachers said Florida on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

88
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 2>that was when they were somebody you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

89
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Florida to Louisiana looked up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida.</v>

92
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.953
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely did because Florida had that </v>

93
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 2>coast land had pitches a sunshine on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their shirt.</v>

94
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.890
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunshine.</v>

95
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sun or people sitting on like an </v>

96
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 2>umbrella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

97
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 2>they weren't infested with alligators </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet either.</v>

98
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.341
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

99
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 2>we didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't worry about it as much then,</v>

100
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lost somebody to an animal or </v>

101
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:55.984
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back then I felt like it wasn't as big </v>

102
00:04:56.951 --> 00:04:57.784
<v Speaker 2>of a deal as it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really in the eighties and nineties if </v>

103
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 2>you lost somebody to an animal or an </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal bite,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

105
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 2>part of God's plan I think.</v>

106
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Whereas now it's like just something </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy that happened at Disney world,</v>

107
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:11.530

111
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>feet long.</v>

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.253
<v Speaker 2>We can't show it on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to find it on youtube because </v>

138
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 2>we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got that gut be pulled off facebook.</v>

139
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 2>There's something happens when you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these animal videos in particular,</v>

140
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 2>when they go on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people own those videos,</v>

141
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.013
<v Speaker 2>so when they go to look for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have like an algorithm that can </v>

142
00:06:38.811 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 2>find it and if it's on your page they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull your whole page down.</v>

143
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they own this but so this so many films,</v>

144
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple different angles of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of people filling because it was</v>

145
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 2>so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these people are all playing golf and</v>

146
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:49.480
<v Speaker 2>they're in the foreground so you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>see him like,</v>

147
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.323
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

148
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 2>Look at the guy's a real animal and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize how big it is.</v>

149
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:57.554
<v Speaker 2>When you see a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Watch how this guy walks in the </v>

150
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 2>foreground and the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the guy looks Turkish,</v>

151
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 2>a little doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks fake.</v>

152
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 2>It looks fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks fucking gigantic now.</v>

153
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Now you see how big it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you understand how big it is because</v>

154
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 2>you see this guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you?</v>

155
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they estimated it's somewhere around</v>

156
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 2>15 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And did they catch it?</v>

157
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found it again.</v>

158
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.820
<v Speaker 2>They found it again in a pond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if he can find it.</v>

159
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:23.591
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

160
00:07:23.591 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 2>they really rediscovered this alligator </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a pond.</v>

161
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the title of the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're making a comeback.</v>

162
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:32.174
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope something good comes into tax at </v>

166
00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to fight them.</v>

167
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get out there and do something,</v>

168
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this dude that I have A.</v>

169
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.210
<v Speaker 2>I've had on my podcast before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said his name is Jim shockey.</v>

170
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.373
<v Speaker 2>He's a very famous hunter from Canada </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they hired him to go to a certain </v>

171
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:54.920
<v Speaker 2>river in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the Congo,</v>

172
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:56.180
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might have been the Nile.</v>

173
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had to go.</v>

174
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.310
<v Speaker 2>He went down there to kill some </v>
<v Speaker 2>crocodiles that were eating people.</v>

175
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 2>It is one of the craziest videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

176
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:05.120
<v Speaker 2>You go there and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

177
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.140
<v Speaker 2>these villagers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's got to stump where everyone's</v>

178
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 2>missing an arm or a hand or they got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chunk bitten out of their chest.</v>

179
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:12.644
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy when you look at these poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and they're all just living in </v>

180
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:18.110
<v Speaker 2>fear and while he was down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman got taken.</v>

181
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.093
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were up river looking for these </v>

182
00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:25.370
<v Speaker 2>killer crocodiles to try to shoot him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the women was washing clothes</v>

183
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 2>and she just got yanked right out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

184
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was really scary,</v>

185
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:32.270
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's seeing the laundry.</v>

186
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.403
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

187
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.943
<v Speaker 2>Underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seeing the reaction of the people that </v>

188
00:08:37.281 --> 00:08:38.990
<v Speaker 2>were wailing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just wailing,</v>

189
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:40.230
<v Speaker 2>crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.440
<v Speaker 2>because it wasn't just like they lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>

191
00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:44.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lost another person.</v>

192
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that woman's gone now forever.</v>

193
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.450
<v Speaker 2>She was consumed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consumed by a monster like that.</v>

194
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.900
<v Speaker 2>That is their actual existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

195
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.973
<v Speaker 2>Sitting by a river that they need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's water for life and the water is </v>

196
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:03.150
<v Speaker 2>infested by monsters who are actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>actively targeting them for food.</v>

197
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

198
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:06.663
<v Speaker 2>That'd be like if somebody like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a killer in Walmart and they </v>

199
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 2>just didn't know who or where.</v>

200
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.643
<v Speaker 2>It was constantly like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lions would jump out while you were </v>

201
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:14.000
<v Speaker 2>eating at Walmart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

202
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.250
<v Speaker 2>but when you're buying food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

203
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 2>we got it pretty easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

204
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people must be so interesting like</v>

205
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 2>people that live under that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure,</v>

206
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:25.620
<v Speaker 2>like their view of life and we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand their language.</v>

207
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.960
<v Speaker 2>I bet they have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

208
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:32.961
<v Speaker 2>like you'll listen to like read like </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient works of literature,</v>

209
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 2>ancient poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

210
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Speaker 2>And you think about it like these are </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are going through a war,</v>

211
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.720
<v Speaker 2>like the ancient Greeks and the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>Romans.</v>

212
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Like you would read their words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

213
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 2>well this is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know it's being translated.</v>

214
00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:46.590
<v Speaker 2>This is the words of someone who's gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>through like sword war.</v>

215
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.453
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back when they would fight with arrows </v>

216
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 2>and shit and swords and catapults and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the intensity of life.</v>

217
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Back then when death was just around </v>
<v Speaker 2>every corner,</v>

218
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 2>it was everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be so,</v>

219
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.160
<v Speaker 2>so intense to talk to someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should fly in a pygmy or something.</v>

220
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 2>You thought about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

221
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:04.794

<v Speaker 2>right there on the desk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like.</v>

235
00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:42.870
<v Speaker 2>The hammer these nails out and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned them into knives.</v>

236
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.213
<v Speaker 2>See?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That starts out of nail that they find </v>

237
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:50.950
<v Speaker 2>way and they pound it down and sharpen </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and turn it into a knife.</v>

238
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Additive history came back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If history struck back,</v>

239
00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:56.280
<v Speaker 2>did we would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't make it.</v>

240
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make It.</v>

241
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.800
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't make it long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

242
00:10:58.801 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 2>you'd be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

243
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not prepared for a bull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would be though.</v>

244
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.890
<v Speaker 2>People are adaptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a smart dude.</v>

245
00:11:04.891 --> 00:11:06.120
<v Speaker 2>Thea Yvonne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would lead,</v>

246
00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I would think a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would adapt.</v>

247
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.390
<v Speaker 2>I'd lay low in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

248
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 2>like somebody doesn't pick my battles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

249
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.713
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to kill somebody immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to find the first person in </v>

250
00:11:14.671 --> 00:11:15.504
<v Speaker 2>your group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weakest person and kill them in </v>

251
00:11:16.771 --> 00:11:18.270
<v Speaker 2>front of everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

252
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't just stand there and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

253
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duh,</v>

254
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.090
<v Speaker 2>kill some dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But think about them and you can't stand</v>

255
00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:28.170
<v Speaker 2>there and just be in a comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

256
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:30.240
<v Speaker 2>everybody's chatting group huddle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's like,</v>

257
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.433
<v Speaker 2>you got to take somebody out right then </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's going to show your </v>

258
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:37.050
<v Speaker 2>dominance of $100 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least going to show like this dude is</v>

259
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.510
<v Speaker 2>gonna do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

260
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.580
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think if you think ahead,</v>

261
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.440
<v Speaker 2>you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no.</v>

262
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.333
<v Speaker 2>Then they're going to think that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>got arbitrarily gonna always kill the </v>

263
00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:48.420
<v Speaker 2>weakest person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually it's going to get to know one</v>

264
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.340
<v Speaker 2>because there's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next week is person.</v>

265
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.380
<v Speaker 2>That guy is dead now and the next week </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

266
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:54.000
<v Speaker 2>who's to decide whether or not you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>weak</v>

267
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 3>or you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We if you were going to do that,</v>

268
00:11:55.931 --> 00:12:00.010
<v Speaker 3>that person would have to be either a </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible person who is victimizing other</v>

269
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:04.520
<v Speaker 3>people or they would have to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacked first.</v>

270
00:12:04.521 --> 00:12:05.354
<v Speaker 3>We'd have to be or they would have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>been such a piece of shit that people </v>

271
00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:08.694
<v Speaker 3>are rooting for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like somebody who was real chatty and </v>

272
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:11.044
<v Speaker 3>you just asked them did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way I'm trying to survive </v>

273
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.340
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

274
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.533
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second coming of the universe and </v>

275
00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:20.200
<v Speaker 3>some dudes chatty in my group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

276
00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.190
<v Speaker 3>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially with like,</v>

277
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.043
<v Speaker 3>he fucks up some hunting parties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're out there the sneaking up on a </v>

278
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:26.740
<v Speaker 3>pig and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

279
00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:27.574
<v Speaker 3>it's so hot out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking pig runs away and </v>

280
00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:32.060
<v Speaker 3>everybody's hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

281
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was He the first man?</v>

282
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:35.680
<v Speaker 3>I think about that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if a plane crash,</v>

283
00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:36.970
<v Speaker 3>I already know I'm planning to head did.</v>

284
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.890
<v Speaker 3>I'd eat a Vietnamese guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

285
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Because that's easier to start or move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you attack somebody bigger,</v>

286
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.310
<v Speaker 3>you eat somebody bigger in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people,</v>

287
00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:49.060
<v Speaker 3>it's going to alarm people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you got to eat a small person,</v>

288
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:49.923
<v Speaker 3>so stature is important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you've dumbed down a viet </v>

289
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.590
<v Speaker 3>people aren't gonna be that upset at </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

290
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.290
<v Speaker 3>It means people are going to be super </v>
<v Speaker 3>upset.</v>

291
00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:57.880
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dad?</v>

292
00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Their sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're more understanding of things.</v>

293
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this a character you're playing?</v>

294
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you eat a black dude,</v>

295
00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:08.220
<v Speaker 3>you eat a black lady and her family's </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

296
00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:10.960
<v Speaker 3>There are going to be pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think a Vietnamese person,</v>

297
00:13:10.961 --> 00:13:11.794
<v Speaker 3>we'll let you slide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that they'd be much more </v>

298
00:13:13.451 --> 00:13:17.020
<v Speaker 3>forgiving of a couple of day period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a like their relatives.</v>

299
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:18.160
<v Speaker 3>You don't think so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly.</v>

300
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.570
<v Speaker 3>One thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

301
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

302
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.120
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think they'd be super </v>
<v Speaker 3>pissed at you.</v>

303
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.043
<v Speaker 3>Especially modernized ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what is interesting is like Vietnam </v>

304
00:13:25.731 --> 00:13:26.564
<v Speaker 3>was one of the few places where </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans can go back to Vietnam and </v>

305
00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:32.110
<v Speaker 3>they don't seem to hold any grudge at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

306
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:37.740
<v Speaker 3>Exhibit a exhibit a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly it will.</v>

307
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 3>Asian people in general are just much </v>
<v Speaker 3>more forgiving and understanding.</v>

308
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:45.760
<v Speaker 3>It seems like after like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

309
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.833
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have much,</v>

310
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.330
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a giant generalization.</v>

311
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.730
<v Speaker 3>It probably is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

312
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a fast for like four days and then</v>

313
00:13:52.781 --> 00:13:53.614
<v Speaker 3>I was at the best buy and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I remember this Vietnamese guy was </v>

314
00:13:58.181 --> 00:13:59.710
<v Speaker 3>trying to help me out and I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even hear him.</v>

315
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:04.450
<v Speaker 3>I was so hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't ended up fast for four days.</v>

316
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

317
00:14:05.331 --> 00:14:07.300
<v Speaker 3>When you're trying to prove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

318
00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:08.134
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was probably just dealing with some </v>

319
00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:10.360
<v Speaker 3>stuff and I was just trying to find a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different way to handle it,</v>

320
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:11.194
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

321
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.083
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I remember this Vietnamese guy </v>

322
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.213
<v Speaker 3>and I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if everybody turned the other way for a </v>

323
00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:18.430
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could eat this young fella.</v>

324
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.480
<v Speaker 3>His name was ben actually over here in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Westwood,</v>

325
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.480
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd never thought,</v>

326
00:14:25.481 --> 00:14:26.710
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so ridiculous.</v>

327
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.813
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

328
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.920
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never thought that before.</v>

329
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:30.993
<v Speaker 3>So you only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to the verge of cannibalism </v>

330
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:33.990
<v Speaker 3>after just four days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

331
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.920
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much weight did you lose?</v>

332
00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.110
<v Speaker 3>I probably lost about four pounds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>

333
00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 3>I needed to know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I got clear man.</v>

334
00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:43.030
<v Speaker 3>I could see and I could hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swear to God.</v>

335
00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Y'All could hear somebody fold a piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>of bread from 80 feet away,</v>

336
00:14:45.791 --> 00:14:47.600
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so hungry dude.</v>

337
00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.990
<v Speaker 3>I could hear a fucking skittle hit the </v>
<v Speaker 3>summit.</v>

338
00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 3>Cross the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really</v>

339
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.843
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

340
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that it heightens your </v>
<v Speaker 2>senses because your,</v>

341
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:55.993
<v Speaker 2>your hunger was so sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent and I could see how </v>

342
00:14:57.831 --> 00:14:58.664
<v Speaker 2>people felt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see how people felt if somebody </v>

343
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 2>wasn't feeling well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see it man.</v>

344
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.040
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

345
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.943
<v Speaker 3>I swear I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I became much more in tune and </v>

346
00:15:06.691 --> 00:15:10.290
<v Speaker 3>it could've been the hunger that then </v>
<v Speaker 3>like manifested itself into you,</v>

347
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.443
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting to find other ways in a way to </v>

348
00:15:13.381 --> 00:15:15.330
<v Speaker 3>connect with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then maybe you know,</v>

349
00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:16.560
<v Speaker 3>limbically you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

350
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.300
<v Speaker 3>maybe they'll give me food or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

351
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.190
<v Speaker 3>if that makes any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does a little bit.</v>

352
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:25.100
<v Speaker 2>Well also I wonder if this is pure </v>
<v Speaker 2>speculation,</v>

353
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 2>but I wonder if it's possible that </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>

354
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:30.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say animals have like intense acute</v>

355
00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:34.010
<v Speaker 2>sense of smell and we know that their </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision is fucking spectacular,</v>

356
00:15:34.011 --> 00:15:34.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a cat.</v>

357
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Cats have spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

358
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:37.363
<v Speaker 2>I think that they said a wild sheep has </v>
<v Speaker 2>a vision that's 10 times better than a </v>

359
00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:43.010
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>

360
00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:46.400
<v Speaker 2>they have like 10 x binoculars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how wild sheep is looking at</v>

361
00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:48.830
<v Speaker 2>you all the time to hey turkeys think </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

362
00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I think Turkey's main might be even </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger or turkeys.</v>

363
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Turkeys might even be 20 power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got like double,</v>

364
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.700
<v Speaker 2>like a powerful set of binoculars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't expect it looking at him,</v>

365
00:15:58.701 --> 00:15:59.534
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what else was going to say is I </v>

366
00:16:00.231 --> 00:16:03.500
<v Speaker 2>wonder if they see things that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>detect.</v>

367
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Like I wonder if they could see like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual aura or like it maybe be like you</v>

368
00:16:09.651 --> 00:16:10.484
<v Speaker 2>don't just smell different when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>scared because they say you smell </v>

369
00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:14.810
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can smell fear and adrenaline.</v>

370
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Like I wonder if they can see things </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

371
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if they could see your feelings </v>

372
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:19.304
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

373
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.940
<v Speaker 3>Like Dang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy over there is depressed,</v>

374
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:23.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the guy said,</v>

375
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:24.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could either.</v>

376
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.120
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

377
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:27.590
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting then because animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>

378
00:16:27.591 --> 00:16:28.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be like,</v>

379
00:16:28.691 --> 00:16:29.524
<v Speaker 3>for some people they're very comforting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's one of the reasons why if </v>

380
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.880
<v Speaker 3>they have a better sense of sight that </v>
<v Speaker 3>can then like transcend</v>

381
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.610
<v Speaker 2>just a visual capability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

382
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:38.563
<v Speaker 2>Would it at Jamie just pulled this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some animals are capable of magneto </v>

383
00:16:42.321 --> 00:16:43.154
<v Speaker 2>reception boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an added sense that helps them detect </v>

384
00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:47.294
<v Speaker 2>magnetic fields.</v>
<v Speaker 2>European scientists have now learned </v>

385
00:16:49.701 --> 00:16:50.534
<v Speaker 2>that the molecule responsible for this </v>
<v Speaker 2>trait is also found in the eyes of dogs </v>

386
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.553
<v Speaker 2>and some primates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which suggests the two might be capable </v>

387
00:16:57.471 --> 00:17:01.160
<v Speaker 2>of seeing magnetic fields.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy fucking shit.</v>

388
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.890
<v Speaker 2>I knew it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

389
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.280
<v Speaker 2>I knew dogs and primates may be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see magnetic fields.</v>

390
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is February 23rd 2016.</v>

391
00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:12.860
<v Speaker 2>So this is a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is all fairly new stuff.</v>

392
00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:13.880
<v Speaker 2>Which is funny though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A year ago,</v>

393
00:17:13.881 --> 00:17:14.450
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was new shit.</v>

396
00:17:16.701 --> 00:17:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

397
00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:23.450
<v Speaker 2>So they might be able to like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you've heard it or as did you,</v>

398
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.770
<v Speaker 2>do you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you believe in ours?</v>

399
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:27.200
<v Speaker 2>What's your feeling on someone who said </v>
<v Speaker 2>they could see your aura?</v>

400
00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in.</v>

401
00:17:29.521 --> 00:17:31.610
<v Speaker 3>I remember one time this lady thought I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

402
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.000
<v Speaker 3>I was at a Vfw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

403
00:17:33.001 --> 00:17:33.834
<v Speaker 3>And I was waiting to get a ride home and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this lady said she asked me if I was </v>

404
00:17:37.171 --> 00:17:39.600
<v Speaker 3>like an angel or something and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

405
00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:40.560
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>

406
00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:42.410
<v Speaker 3>you seem like an angel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wants some deck.</v>

407
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.490
<v Speaker 3>She might have wanted some decks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sweet Angel.</v>

408
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.180
<v Speaker 3>And she was kind of busted as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's Kinda bad apple.</v>

409
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:49.770
<v Speaker 3>But it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might.</v>

410
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.633
<v Speaker 3>Well thank you ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was waiting for someone to come and </v>

411
00:17:52.231 --> 00:17:53.064
<v Speaker 3>say that to me and if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew I'd be with them because that's </v>

412
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:57.900
<v Speaker 3>how it's meant to be as true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could have been over here.</v>

413
00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:02.901
<v Speaker 3>Angel Swing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sweet Dick ran out swing Lulu beer and</v>

414
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:07.500
<v Speaker 3>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was going through a tough time.</v>

415
00:18:07.501 --> 00:18:10.450
<v Speaker 3>It's all I vaguely remember about her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she wasn't very.</v>

416
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.510
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't doing physical fitness?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

417
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.763
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you hear someone like an can </v>

418
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.230
<v Speaker 3>see ours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is your automatic assumption?</v>

419
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.300
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hm?</v>

420
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some people can get indefinitely</v>

421
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.170
<v Speaker 3>or closer to getting a feeling if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>

422
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.800
<v Speaker 3>If they're pretty clear themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are coming from like a neutral,</v>

423
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:32.634
<v Speaker 3>pretty neutral state where they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmed in their head and that sort </v>

424
00:18:34.561 --> 00:18:35.820
<v Speaker 3>of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then yeah,</v>

425
00:18:35.821 --> 00:18:37.980
<v Speaker 3>they might be able to pick up energy is </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much better I think.</v>

426
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.960
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

442
00:19:16.561 --> 00:19:17.760
<v Speaker 3>dream catchers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm out,</v>

00:19:17.761 --> 00:19:21.450
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can't treat 'em out.</v>

444
00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:23.220
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where my dream sleep.</v>

445
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I get up in the morning,</v>

446
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.100
<v Speaker 3>I say my praise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my praise to the universe.</v>

447
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.260
<v Speaker 3>And then I checked the dream catcher for</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

448
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.620
<v Speaker 3>What if we caught today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's my first thought of the day?</v>

449
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.513
<v Speaker 3>Just emptying out my dream catcher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's shaking him into a net and that's </v>

450
00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:40.620
<v Speaker 3>when I knew that I was going to teach </v>
<v Speaker 3>aqua yoga.</v>

451
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.750
<v Speaker 3>It's my new style of yoga that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>created.</v>

452
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:49.970
<v Speaker 3>I hope we were out here in a kitty </v>
<v Speaker 3>swimming pool or yoga there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I wish I had.</v>

<v Speaker 3>no orgasmic meditation.</v>

456
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.280
<v Speaker 3>Like you meditate as you're coming or </v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't get the man doesn't release any </v>

459
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they find pleasure in it.</v>

460

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get caught up.</v>

463
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.753
<v Speaker 3>I remember this story about this dude </v>
<v Speaker 3>who was in jail and he had managed to </v>

464
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:18.924
<v Speaker 3>seduce one of the female guards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a female guard and just cruise </v>

465
00:20:21.451 --> 00:20:24.120
<v Speaker 3>around her enough and eventually she'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>let them out or something like that.</v>

466
00:20:24.121 --> 00:20:24.954
<v Speaker 3>Something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this dude could lie in his bed and </v>

467
00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:28.494
<v Speaker 3>through the power of his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd make his dick fully hard without </v>

468
00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:31.584
<v Speaker 3>touching it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he come on himself without </v>

469
00:20:33.781 --> 00:20:35.140
<v Speaker 3>moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the dark art.</v>

470
00:20:35.141 --> 00:20:35.974
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't trust somebody that comes without </v>

471
00:20:39.751 --> 00:20:42.480
<v Speaker 3>touching themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems a little extreme.</v>

472
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.523
<v Speaker 3>I can understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be possible to do that because </v>

473
00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 3>I've had wet dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if I've had wet dreams,</v>

474
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.233
<v Speaker 2>wet dream is all like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mind thinks you're actually having </v>

475
00:20:51.731 --> 00:20:55.450
<v Speaker 2>sex and then you ejaculate and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up and you fucking idiot.</v>

476
00:20:55.451 --> 00:20:57.520
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came all over myself.</v>

477
00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the reality of a wet dream.</v>

478
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's all possible through the mind,</v>

479
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:03.543
<v Speaker 2>so that's possible through the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't it possible for someone who's </v>

480
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:07.993
<v Speaker 2>a really dedicated practitioner of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation to just concentrate entirely </v>

481
00:21:13.631 --> 00:21:14.464
<v Speaker 2>on recreating the sensation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasurable intercourse to the point </v>

482
00:21:17.951 --> 00:21:18.784
<v Speaker 2>where they ski all over themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excessive while you're staring in the </v>

483
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:27.010
<v Speaker 2>eyes of the guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prison guard now.</v>

484
00:21:27.011 --> 00:21:27.844
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can look them in the eyes and do </v>

485
00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:32.350
<v Speaker 2>it and she's looking at you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just move to Mexico,</v>

486
00:21:32.351 --> 00:21:33.010
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aww.</v>

487
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a wizard work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

488
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:34.924
<v Speaker 2>That sounds cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Louis throws documentary where he's </v>

489
00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:37.564
<v Speaker 2>at the prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They talk about like trying to come </v>

490
00:21:39.071 --> 00:21:41.350
<v Speaker 2>while they're staring at the prison </v>
<v Speaker 2>guard in the eyes and it's like,</v>

491
00:21:41.351 --> 00:21:43.990
<v Speaker 2>that's not sexual abuse or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

492
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.200
<v Speaker 2>And I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that?</v>

493
00:21:45.201 --> 00:21:46.031
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right,</v>

494
00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:46.950
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

495
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.770
<v Speaker 2>I try to do it to try to get them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pass by.</v>

496
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.410
<v Speaker 2>They tried to ejaculate on them too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

497
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

498
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Well that was in silence of the lambs </v>
<v Speaker 2>number.</v>

499
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

500
00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Actually saw up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ran into that guy the other day.</v>

501
00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:00.730
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Hopkins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

502
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.480
<v Speaker 2>remember the guy next to Anthony Hopkins</v>
<v Speaker 2>Migs,</v>

503
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.750
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came,</v>

504
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.060
<v Speaker 2>came in his hand and threw it in Jodie </v>
<v Speaker 2>foster's face.</v>

505
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened to him?</v>

506
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.230
<v Speaker 2>That was his one moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was this big moment,</v>

507
00:22:12.231 --> 00:22:14.770
<v Speaker 2>a big moment that I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

508
00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:18.460
<v Speaker 2>come home and in a movie that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fricking old,</v>

509
00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:20.110
<v Speaker 2>that's old fashioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did our big thing.</v>

510
00:22:20.111 --> 00:22:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Used to be the jerk off of the bus </v>
<v Speaker 2>window when I was growing up.</v>

511
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.210
<v Speaker 2>But it's a weird thing to want to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>on somebody like,</v>

512
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.770
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as they're coming here,</v>

513
00:22:26.771 --> 00:22:27.860
<v Speaker 2>they come here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come here,</v>

514
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:28.910
<v Speaker 2>they got ya.</v>

515
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.690
<v Speaker 2>And see right there he throws it at her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it seems old fashioned to me,</v>

516
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.470
<v Speaker 2>kinda seemed like an old fashioned game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

517
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:36.363
<v Speaker 2>it's a barbaric game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it makes sense that prisoners would </v>

518
00:22:38.561 --> 00:22:40.210
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how crazy is that?</v>

519
00:22:40.211 --> 00:22:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Like he got his cum on her face and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's probably haunted by that forever.</v>

520
00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.853
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's not a real person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't really happen and it probably </v>

521
00:22:47.321 --> 00:22:48.154
<v Speaker 2>was just like frosting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were in prison or some sort of a </v>

522
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:52.503
<v Speaker 2>deal like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think you did advance into </v>

523
00:22:53.231 --> 00:22:56.320
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

524
00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:01.390
<v Speaker 2>honestly I think a lot of people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd have to really consider if</v>

525
00:23:01.391 --> 00:23:03.160
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be locked in there for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of your life,</v>

526
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.940
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you were cool with </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking dudes or no pleasure.</v>

527
00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Now what if you had like one appeal but </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like 25,</v>

528
00:23:10.091 --> 00:23:12.910
<v Speaker 2>like an appeal trial and it was 25 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

529
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:13.763
<v Speaker 2>Like that's kind of the risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know like how many years will some </v>

530
00:23:17.801 --> 00:23:18.634
<v Speaker 2>dudes would get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They rationalize it like in like gang </v>

531
00:23:22.291 --> 00:23:24.330
<v Speaker 2>banger communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call it gay for the stay.</v>

532
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they would go and they would just </v>

533
00:23:26.711 --> 00:23:28.930
<v Speaker 2>get gay soon as they get in jail and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they get out of jail.</v>

534
00:23:28.931 --> 00:23:29.764
<v Speaker 2>They try not to be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was in that movie American me and </v>

535
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.450
<v Speaker 2>obviously I have no idea how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how accurate that was,</v>

536
00:23:34.451 --> 00:23:35.284
<v Speaker 2>but that's been discussed before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think Edward James Almost when he </v>

537
00:23:39.731 --> 00:23:40.564
<v Speaker 2>did that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he kinda got in trouble with </v>

538
00:23:42.461 --> 00:23:43.294
<v Speaker 2>some gang bangers who were particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset about the way he portrayed her </v>

539
00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:49.040
<v Speaker 2>while in prison life in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

540
00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:49.874
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were upset at them about the </v>

541
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:53.210
<v Speaker 2>alarming the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll be quite terrifying.</v>

542
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:54.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alarming group Tub.</v>

543
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Set the wrong group to upset because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have like drug induced gays.</v>

544
00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.780
<v Speaker 2>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>

545
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rug induced.</v>

547
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:06.440
<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can get you with the drug.</v>

548
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.251
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

549
00:24:07.251 --> 00:24:08.720
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you like,</v>

550
00:24:08.721 --> 00:24:09.554
<v Speaker 2>I remember they had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's popular culture in the </v>

551
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:12.990
<v Speaker 2>eighties and nineties where they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>like behind the rest areas,</v>

552
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.350
<v Speaker 2>a lot of men would meet up and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

553
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:17.780
<v Speaker 2>do drugs and find pleasure with each </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

556
00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Rest stops off the interstate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

557
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:23.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually like a seaman building,</v>

568
00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:49.334
<v Speaker 2>across from this river and the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of the river was the back of the </v>

578
00:25:19.821 --> 00:25:23.450
<v Speaker 2>a fucking escapee from prison and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave him the shirt,</v>

579
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.261
<v Speaker 2>smell it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smell it,</v>

580
00:25:24.261 --> 00:25:25.130
<v Speaker 2>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go get him.</v>

581
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.900
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It smelled that bud fucking,</v>

582
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:27.820
<v Speaker 2>you know they were there.</v>

583
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.233
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if we could get heightened </v>

584
00:25:30.201 --> 00:25:31.034
<v Speaker 2>senses in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's one of the things that's </v>

585
00:25:32.061 --> 00:25:33.110
<v Speaker 2>coming next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

586
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.180
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine we're gearing towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

587
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:39.950
<v Speaker 2>It feels like maybe naturally our senses</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be getting dollar.</v>

588
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think we don't use them.</v>

589
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.220
<v Speaker 2>We don't use them for danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't use them to stock pray.</v>

590
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:49.370
<v Speaker 2>We don't use them to run from something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just don't.</v>

591
00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:50.204
<v Speaker 2>We don't use them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think they're getting weaker and </v>

592
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:53.840
<v Speaker 2>weaker when the are thumbs up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thumbs need to move fast.</v>

593
00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:54.674
<v Speaker 2>Now I bet we have the fastest thumbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have any fucking living being that's </v>

594
00:25:56.841 --> 00:25:59.360
<v Speaker 2>ever existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean to look back at people like thumb</v>

595
00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:02.720
<v Speaker 2>dexterity now compared to today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh I bet people can do.</v>

596
00:26:02.721 --> 00:26:05.120
<v Speaker 2>I bet if I did this to some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people in the 18 hundreds,</v>

597
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:06.163
<v Speaker 2>they would go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will learn to move your thumbs with </v>

598
00:26:08.691 --> 00:26:09.530
<v Speaker 2>such speed.</v>

599
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.393
<v Speaker 2>Come and see the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you showed somebody an iphone back </v>

600
00:26:13.161 --> 00:26:15.220
<v Speaker 2>then and just texted a message on it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

601
00:26:15.221 --> 00:26:15.830
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just text.</v>

602
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:16.663
<v Speaker 2>Text your name on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They but they would be so slow and </v>

603
00:26:21.171 --> 00:26:22.004
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're flying through your phone </v>

604
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.480
<v Speaker 2>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get your fingers will get quicker.</v>

605
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.273
<v Speaker 2>Hearing will probably stay the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No need for it to get any better </v>

606
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:31.243
<v Speaker 2>hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body's going to shrink shrivel </v>

607
00:26:32.811 --> 00:26:33.980
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bones,</v>

608
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.823
<v Speaker 2>muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to become like little </v>

609
00:26:35.181 --> 00:26:36.690
<v Speaker 2>aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The aliens,</v>

610
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.630
<v Speaker 2>the big heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bodies will be in carts.</v>

611
00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Will be in some type of a cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

612
00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like an old fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at Tesla will.</v>

613
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.720
<v Speaker 2>We'll have individual teslas that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like eggs and surround you and you can't</v>

614
00:26:48.721 --> 00:26:50.880
<v Speaker 2>even steer and they just drive you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

615
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:52.043
<v Speaker 2>drive you where you want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just talked to and it takes you </v>

616
00:26:53.251 --> 00:26:54.084
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

617
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 2>But we will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will we still have sex?</v>

618
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:58.350
<v Speaker 2>We'll have to have some sort of a of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a union,</v>

619
00:26:58.351 --> 00:27:00.780
<v Speaker 2>but it'll probably be done in a lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they'll do sex anymore.</v>

620
00:27:00.781 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of happen one day.</v>

621
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

622
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.343
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one day they'll make the people </v>

623
00:27:06.181 --> 00:27:06.751
<v Speaker 2>decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

624
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:08.880
<v Speaker 2>we have sex for pleasure and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

625
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.970
<v Speaker 2>we'll still do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'll meet in the meeting,</v>

626
00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:16.380
<v Speaker 2>will be done in a laboratory because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>ensures 100 percent excellent DNA,</v>

627
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.900
<v Speaker 2>healthy children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can factor out racism,</v>

628
00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

629
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.020
<v Speaker 2>you could probably do things to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

630
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Like I want my kid to be a seven foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>tall,</v>

631
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pro lineman.</v>

632
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.400
<v Speaker 2>I want them to grow up to be 440 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 2>lighter.</v>

633
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:29.310
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

634
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they fix it.</v>

635
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that happens,</v>

636
00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:32.634
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are not going to just take a </v>

637
00:27:33.301 --> 00:27:35.580
<v Speaker 2>chance with regular sex and having </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular kid.</v>

638
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.070
<v Speaker 2>So they're going to produce these super </v>
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>

639
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.560
<v Speaker 2>So slowly but surely it'll start out </v>
<v Speaker 2>like cell phones were.</v>

640
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.560
<v Speaker 2>Remember when Gordon Gecko was walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the beach,</v>

641
00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:44.940
<v Speaker 2>that big ass brick and nobody would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>caught dead with today.</v>

642
00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:46.323
<v Speaker 2>It would be just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll start off with those stupid </v>

643
00:27:47.701 --> 00:27:48.534
<v Speaker 2>bricks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It only rich people have and that </v>

644
00:27:49.471 --> 00:27:51.240
<v Speaker 2>eventually that break will be a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>joke.</v>

645
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.640
<v Speaker 2>And everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be easy to pay.</v>

646
00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.500
<v Speaker 2>It'll be just like everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you get your kid vaccinated?</v>

647
00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you pick what your kid's gonna be?</v>

648
00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

649
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I made a fucking Amazon woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can kill people with their legs and</v>

650
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.050
<v Speaker 2>some people would still be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

651
00:28:04.051 --> 00:28:05.570
<v Speaker 2>we went the old fashioned way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

652
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.350
<v Speaker 2>we were deciding not to choose.</v>

653
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.480
<v Speaker 2>We're going to leave it up to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

654
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.340
<v Speaker 2>What if your kid is born with some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of an ailment?</v>

655
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.040
<v Speaker 2>You'd be so heartbroken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd go big Asian Dude.</v>

656
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:16.410
<v Speaker 2>I'd go four or five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six huge Asian sons,</v>

657
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.870
<v Speaker 2>nine feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nine feet to loggers.</v>

658
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The loggers browse more than a logger.</v>

659
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:23.070
<v Speaker 2>How long do you think they would last </v>
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

660
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Like how long do you live if you're nine</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet tall?</v>

661
00:28:24.931 --> 00:28:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a whole long.</v>

662
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Eight or nine years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you know what I'm saying.</v>

663
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Who is the biggest guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The biggest guy knew growing up,</v>

664
00:28:33.961 --> 00:28:37.200
<v Speaker 2>this kid named Ricardo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he died at like 14 or 12.</v>

665
00:28:37.201 --> 00:28:38.640
<v Speaker 2>He died at 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a heart attack.</v>

666
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.563
<v Speaker 2>How big was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Playing basketball and he's probably </v>

667
00:28:40.321 --> 00:28:41.760
<v Speaker 2>about 65.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

668
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.410
<v Speaker 2>He was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was that age.</v>

669
00:28:43.411 --> 00:28:44.244
<v Speaker 2>He had a hard time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a heart attack in the basketball </v>

670
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:45.600
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

671
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Hold on Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do remember len bias.</v>

672
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Remember that guy who was playing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Celtics,</v>

673
00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:51.420
<v Speaker 2>he dropped dead in the middle of a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

674
00:28:51.421 --> 00:28:52.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he hits some cocaine.</v>

675
00:28:52.531 --> 00:28:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Didn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donate doom.</v>

676
00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Doom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

677
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.810
<v Speaker 2>That is the tallest guy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert Wadlow.</v>

678
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:05.400
<v Speaker 2>He was eight feet 11 inches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's essentially nine feet tall.</v>

679
00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:07.323
<v Speaker 2>I mean he probably had a fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>posture to like his body looks like it </v>

680
00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:10.554
<v Speaker 2>was all wrecked with arthritis and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His joints must have been just </v>

681
00:29:14.491 --> 00:29:16.030
<v Speaker 2>completely fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bake.</v>

682
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.850
<v Speaker 2>Took a whole family out with his leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

683
00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:18.780
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

684
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.290
<v Speaker 2>you would be able to escape his triangle</v>
<v Speaker 2>because his legs are so long.</v>

685
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.940
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't be able to squeeze down </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

686
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:25.860
<v Speaker 2>He could decorate his legs for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas.</v>

687
00:29:25.861 --> 00:29:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I bet it would be trying to triangle a </v>
<v Speaker 2>squirrel.</v>

688
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Like good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tronic Triangle Square Squirrel.</v>

689
00:29:30.701 --> 00:29:32.280
<v Speaker 2>The little motherfuckers gonna escape.</v>

690
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.713
<v Speaker 2>He's getting too much room and his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll pop your head right out of there </v>

691
00:29:36.571 --> 00:29:38.760
<v Speaker 2>and take side control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But wouldn't you be scared to like.</v>

692
00:29:38.761 --> 00:29:40.590
<v Speaker 2>I feel like some of these athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got to be scared.</v>

693
00:29:40.591 --> 00:29:41.424
<v Speaker 2>They're going to die a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you think that's a fear that kind </v>

694
00:29:43.001 --> 00:29:46.990
<v Speaker 2>of lives in their head because because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of they're so big and immense.</v>

695
00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:47.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry Bird was actually talking about </v>

696
00:29:48.611 --> 00:29:51.460
<v Speaker 2>that recently because Larry Byrd is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's six foot nine.</v>

697
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his wife was real bummed out about.</v>

698
00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:55.333
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it because I'm saying that no</v>
<v Speaker 2>one over seven feet tall ever lives to </v>

699
00:30:00.071 --> 00:30:02.260
<v Speaker 2>be like 75 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't live that long.</v>

700
00:30:02.261 --> 00:30:04.180
<v Speaker 2>You don't see those guys walking around </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that age.</v>

701
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.590
<v Speaker 2>And it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real sad.</v>

702
00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Know had to do something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we need light for the tall,</v>

703
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.910
<v Speaker 2>not a charity.</v>

704
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:10.960
<v Speaker 2>You know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

705
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:15.790
<v Speaker 2>It's just this weird fucking give and </v>
<v Speaker 2>take to this universe.</v>

706
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.640
<v Speaker 2>And if you have this massive advantage </v>
<v Speaker 2>in size,</v>

707
00:30:18.641 --> 00:30:20.550
<v Speaker 2>your ride is quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

708
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.560
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like having a muscle car </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a small gas tank.</v>

709
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.920
<v Speaker 2>This is what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want that 600 horsepower shelby gt,</v>

710
00:30:26.921 --> 00:30:28.990
<v Speaker 2>500.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you get this with.</v>

711
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.940
<v Speaker 2>You got a 10 gallon gas tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good luck.</v>

712
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know I had a ford escort back in the</v>

713
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:34.601
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

714
00:30:34.601 --> 00:30:36.160
<v Speaker 2>You ever drive an escort?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill?</v>

715
00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Russell's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 three.</v>

716
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

717
00:30:40.091 --> 00:30:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Somebody send that to Larry Bird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's black.</v>

718
00:30:41.981 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Black people have better genetics.</v>

719
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.943
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

720
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.760
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have just as many problems.</v>

721
00:30:48.761 --> 00:30:51.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm joking around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but black definitely doesn't crack.</v>

722
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.560
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely a better skin for aging </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

723
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:55.330
<v Speaker 2>It's sugars a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't crack.</v>

724
00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry Bird,</v>

725
00:30:58.541 --> 00:30:59.374
<v Speaker 2>someone get him that quickly I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more likely today that a </v>

726
00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:04.863
<v Speaker 2>giant people like that will live longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're just so good with </v>

727
00:31:07.361 --> 00:31:08.194
<v Speaker 2>medicine and health and so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding about how to take care of </v>

728
00:31:11.021 --> 00:31:11.854
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

729
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.170
<v Speaker 2>But I bet back in the day was like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real problem.</v>

730
00:31:14.171 --> 00:31:15.004
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heart attack is a real issue I </v>

731
00:31:15.881 --> 00:31:17.810
<v Speaker 2>guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so much travel.</v>

732
00:31:17.811 --> 00:31:22.060
<v Speaker 2>The blood has to go through and imagine </v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're seven feet tall,</v>

733
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.450
<v Speaker 2>all the extra real estate your heart has</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pump through.</v>

734
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even thought about that.</v>

735
00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in that sense,</v>

736
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:30.783
<v Speaker 2>you got to think like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on borrowed time once you're </v>

737
00:31:32.711 --> 00:31:33.670
<v Speaker 2>hitting your sixties.</v>

738
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:34.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oof.</v>

739
00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Anything can happen from here on out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

740
00:31:36.401 --> 00:31:38.770
<v Speaker 2>you got a heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a regular heart.</v>

741
00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've got a giant body.</v>

742
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.713
<v Speaker 2>You had a crazy body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their heart's got to be bigger than a </v>

743
00:31:43.961 --> 00:31:45.300
<v Speaker 2>normal person's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big.</v>

744
00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Everything's bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their feet are bigger.</v>

745
00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Hands are bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would assume their head's bigger.</v>

746
00:31:48.881 --> 00:31:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Their heart's got to be bigger to right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would guess,</v>

747
00:31:51.401 --> 00:31:52.810
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the heart of the lesbian.</v>

748
00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:55.690
<v Speaker 2>That's what they told me that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>young and I got a small rib cage to.</v>

749
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Don't they say your heart is the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>size of your fist or is that bullshit?</v>

750
00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tell you when you're a kid.</v>

751
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:03.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's real though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brock Lesnar and a giant fucking heart.</v>

752
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.040
<v Speaker 2>He's a big fist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Giant dude.</v>

753
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous lunchboxes.</v>

754
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Big Old lunchboxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it scary when you meet him?</v>

755
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.780
<v Speaker 2>He's just so big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even.</v>

756
00:32:13.781 --> 00:32:15.010
<v Speaker 2>You don't even feel like you're the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

757
00:32:15.011 --> 00:32:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

758
00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.700
<v Speaker 2>how are you and I both people the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that possible?</v>

759
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:19.623
<v Speaker 2>It's like you ever see like a poodle </v>
<v Speaker 2>meet like a great Dane and the great </v>

760
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:23.470
<v Speaker 2>thing is like the fuck is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was like,</v>

761
00:32:23.471 --> 00:32:26.280
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same thing.</v>

762
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.370
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

763
00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.990
<v Speaker 2>a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the really freaky Ufo people,</v>

764
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:32.913
<v Speaker 2>they believe that that's proof positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>that human beings were genetically </v>

765
00:32:35.411 --> 00:32:38.090
<v Speaker 2>engineered the same way dogs were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

766
00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:38.973
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows where dogs came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know the dogs came from wolves </v>

767
00:32:41.271 --> 00:32:42.104
<v Speaker 2>because they do genetic tests on these </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs and they realized that all dogs </v>

768
00:32:44.661 --> 00:32:46.070
<v Speaker 2>started off as a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them,</v>

769
00:32:46.071 --> 00:32:48.710
<v Speaker 2>and this is like really recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they realize that dogs did.</v>

770
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All dogs.</v>

771
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Wawa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even a Chihuahua.</v>

772
00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.233
<v Speaker 2>That part I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't either except for these </v>

773
00:32:57.111 --> 00:32:59.060
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dudes have already done the DNA work.</v>

774
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.710
<v Speaker 2>You got to respect what they came up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

775
00:33:00.711 --> 00:33:01.544
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they thought was at one point </v>

776
00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:04.940
<v Speaker 2>in time they thought it was a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wild canids.</v>

777
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:05.803
<v Speaker 2>Like all of them were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought like some dogs were from </v>

778
00:33:09.051 --> 00:33:09.884
<v Speaker 2>this wild dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Africa and some dogs maybe came </v>

779
00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:13.880
<v Speaker 2>from wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Husky that looks like a wolf,</v>

780
00:33:13.881 --> 00:33:14.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

781
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.520
<v Speaker 2>Once they did the DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they realize,</v>

782
00:33:16.521 --> 00:33:17.570
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all wolves.</v>

783
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.490
<v Speaker 2>It's the wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's a wolf.</v>

784
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Then what happened then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did some of them get done?</v>

785
00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:25.100
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really don't know Sean.</v>

786
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know that they can do some things.</v>

787
00:33:27.951 --> 00:33:30.440
<v Speaker 2>There was a great article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not article,</v>

788
00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:34.490
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>episode of Radio Lab,</v>

789
00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.450
<v Speaker 2>which is an amazing guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great podcast.</v>

790
00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:40.340
<v Speaker 2>It's really good man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they had a really good one on Fox.</v>

791
00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Says it was part of the episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was about engineering animals and</v>

792
00:33:45.061 --> 00:33:48.980
<v Speaker 2>about engineering evolution and how long</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could change genes,</v>

793
00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:51.350
<v Speaker 2>how long it would take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they took these foxes.</v>

794
00:33:51.351 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 2>They took them from Wild Fox is like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely wild.</v>

795
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you know,</v>

796
00:33:55.581 --> 00:34:00.581
<v Speaker 2>they were just in a regular Fox and by </v>
<v Speaker 2>selectively breeding them,</v>

797
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:05.270
<v Speaker 2>just selectively breeding them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had them down to this floppy eared,</v>

798
00:34:05.271 --> 00:34:06.860
<v Speaker 2>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>docile,</v>

799
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.920
<v Speaker 2>like pet fox thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a few generations,</v>

800
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:10.933
<v Speaker 2>like just a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just did these experiments for a </v>

801
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.160
<v Speaker 2>few years and then eventually got these </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals down to.</v>

802
00:34:16.161 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 2>They were like almost unrecognizable </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a Fox.</v>

803
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Their jaws were smaller that yours were </v>
<v Speaker 2>floppy.</v>

804
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.950
<v Speaker 2>They became like a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that going to.</v>

805
00:34:22.951 --> 00:34:26.480
<v Speaker 2>It took while to make them domestic hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough were to create a market.</v>

806
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:30.170
<v Speaker 2>I think they were doing that may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were definitely also writing it</v>

807
00:34:30.171 --> 00:34:33.290
<v Speaker 2>down as experiments that we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out how long it would take.</v>

808
00:34:33.291 --> 00:34:36.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't totally remember the premise for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experiment,</v>

809
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.033
<v Speaker 2>like why they decided to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember the results and the </v>

810
00:34:39.411 --> 00:34:40.244
<v Speaker 2>results were they would take any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of these foxes that showed any </v>

811
00:34:42.951 --> 00:34:43.784
<v Speaker 2>aggression towards people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of them that weren't like instantly </v>

812
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.290
<v Speaker 2>submissive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would shoot him,</v>

813
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:49.583
<v Speaker 2>kill him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the ones that were submitted </v>

814
00:34:50.611 --> 00:34:51.070
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

815
00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:51.903
<v Speaker 2>They lived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the ones that lived with the ones </v>

816
00:34:54.171 --> 00:34:56.360
<v Speaker 2>that were the most timid and the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>submissive,</v>

817
00:34:56.361 --> 00:34:59.720
<v Speaker 2>and they started getting these floppy </v>
<v Speaker 2>ears like their ears instead of sticking</v>

818
00:34:59.721 --> 00:35:02.570
<v Speaker 2>straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They started flopping and their jaws got</v>

819
00:35:02.571 --> 00:35:04.550
<v Speaker 2>smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the whole thing changed.</v>

820
00:35:04.551 --> 00:35:07.240
<v Speaker 2>I think they've changed color to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening,</v>

821
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.400
<v Speaker 2>like what's happening in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a little bit,</v>

822
00:35:09.401 --> 00:35:10.430
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

823
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what these UFO freaks believe.</v>

824
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.353
<v Speaker 2>They believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's proof positive that aliens came </v>

825
00:35:15.951 --> 00:35:19.190
<v Speaker 2>down and grabbed some monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like has a monkey become a human.</v>

826
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.890
<v Speaker 2>We look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could see a person,</v>

827
00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.690
<v Speaker 2>you see chimpanzee and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

828
00:35:23.691 --> 00:35:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I kind of see where that could have gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>into that.</v>

829
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.713
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy it,</v>

830
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:28.680
<v Speaker 2>but where's all the stuff in the middle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

831
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:29.543
<v Speaker 2>we're the middle monkeys as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come we're udall understand </v>

832
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:32.630
<v Speaker 2>genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

833
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying it.</v>

834
00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.073
<v Speaker 2>It is odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying we didn't come from </v>

835
00:35:37.381 --> 00:35:39.540
<v Speaker 2>humans from chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course we did.</v>

836
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Or from lower primate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a cousin to the chimpanzee really</v>

837
00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:43.524
<v Speaker 2>early in the Middle Lane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there could've been a middleman </v>

838
00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.890
<v Speaker 2>whether it was for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those.</v>

839
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Those all died off and that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes sense,</v>

840
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:52.650
<v Speaker 2>but it is totally fascinating that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>so far ahead of everything else.</v>

841
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.860
<v Speaker 2>My point is when you look at a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing remotely like us.</v>

842
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:02.360
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a giraffe is similar to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deer.</v>

843
00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:06.600
<v Speaker 2>A deer is the intellectual equivalent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a horse,</v>

844
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:07.230
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

845
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.340
<v Speaker 2>there's none of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

846
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:09.293
<v Speaker 2>There's this one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one thing that has the weirdest </v>

847
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:12.870
<v Speaker 2>hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

848
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.733
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

849
00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.950
<v Speaker 2>your face doesn't have hair except for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this part.</v>

850
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.500
<v Speaker 2>It's an anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body only has like a little like,</v>

851
00:36:19.501 --> 00:36:20.550
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's that hair?</v>

852
00:36:20.551 --> 00:36:22.320
<v Speaker 2>What's the hair for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it leftover?</v>

853
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.510
<v Speaker 2>Is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look like a mixture of some shit.</v>

854
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.320
<v Speaker 2>He was like one of those hairless cats </v>
<v Speaker 2>who did this to you?</v>

855
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:31.470
<v Speaker 2>How did they make this out of you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people think aliens took us.</v>

856
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.720
<v Speaker 2>It took monkeys and came back with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they think it will make.</v>

857
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.740
<v Speaker 2>If you look at Shaquille o'neal and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at like Brittany Spears,</v>

858
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.560
<v Speaker 2>clearly they look very different.</v>

859
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:43.560
<v Speaker 2>They're the same species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could easily interbreed just like a</v>

860
00:36:43.561 --> 00:36:44.394
<v Speaker 2>wolf could easily have sex with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bulldog because they're really all </v>

861
00:36:47.911 --> 00:36:50.400
<v Speaker 2>wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so hard to believe.</v>

862
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Like if you didn't know species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you came here,</v>

863
00:36:54.151 --> 00:36:58.110
<v Speaker 2>you were some fucking ball of plasma </v>
<v Speaker 2>from another dimension and you came here</v>

864
00:36:58.111 --> 00:37:00.840
<v Speaker 2>to study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a fucking chance in hell.</v>

865
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.793
<v Speaker 2>You would think that Brittany Spears was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing as Shaquille o'neal or </v>

866
00:37:05.011 --> 00:37:05.844
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I was the same thing as Shaquille </v>

867
00:37:07.081 --> 00:37:09.050
<v Speaker 2>o'neal or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

868
00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:09.933
<v Speaker 2>look at anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm a fucking molly ringwald and </v>

869
00:37:14.521 --> 00:37:17.280
<v Speaker 2>then put her next to Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is that the same?</v>

870
00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.950
<v Speaker 2>How is it the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all the same thing.</v>

871
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.060
<v Speaker 2>You have the Anthony Lyn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

872
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.050
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese basketball player that got </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous for awhile.</v>

873
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.341
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Lin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

874
00:37:26.341 --> 00:37:27.174
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Lin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

875
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put.</v>

876
00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.610
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at Shaquille o'neal.</v>

877
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.730
<v Speaker 2>He's enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so big.</v>

878
00:37:32.731 --> 00:37:35.070
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at his pants too,</v>

879
00:37:35.071 --> 00:37:37.920
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you see if you saw him and we'll pay</v>

880
00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:41.550
<v Speaker 2>next to like a very small Asian guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe the one that you tried to eat</v>

881
00:37:41.551 --> 00:37:43.720
<v Speaker 2>at the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben was his name actually.</v>

882
00:37:43.721 --> 00:37:46.020
<v Speaker 2>Then if you saw him next to Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would say,</v>

883
00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:46.854
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you came from another planet and you </v>

884
00:37:47.821 --> 00:37:50.810
<v Speaker 2>saw a chimpanzee next to an orangutan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would like,</v>

885
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.370
<v Speaker 2>well those are different species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

886
00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.600
<v Speaker 2>This is clearly two different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>

887
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:56.120
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

888
00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:58.010
<v Speaker 2>those are chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Orangutans aren't,</v>

889
00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.570
<v Speaker 2>but people aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

890
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.410
<v Speaker 2>The same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're so weird.</v>

891
00:38:01.411 --> 00:38:05.250
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird that we can like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look so different from each other,</v>

892
00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:07.200
<v Speaker 2>but we all breed with each other just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like dogs do.</v>

893
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.093
<v Speaker 2>I'm amazed that monkeys don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what I don't think that we </v>

894
00:38:10.441 --> 00:38:11.400
<v Speaker 2>evolved from monkeys because.</v>

895
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Because monkeys never come visit us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know what I'm saying though?</v>

896
00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you make it a lot of sense?</v>

897
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Like we go visit them though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about this.</v>

898
00:38:20.161 --> 00:38:23.190
<v Speaker 2>We go visit them at the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're out in the nature Malaysia,</v>

899
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.830
<v Speaker 2>but they never went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever like,</v>

900
00:38:25.831 --> 00:38:26.664
<v Speaker 2>I'm it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you open your window up and </v>

901
00:38:27.841 --> 00:38:30.000
<v Speaker 2>seen a couple of monkeys just seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

902
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:30.893
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>

903
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:33.180
<v Speaker 2>What could have been if they had gotten </v>
<v Speaker 2>their act together?</v>

904
00:38:33.181 --> 00:38:33.931
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

905
00:38:33.931 --> 00:38:34.764
<v Speaker 2>They will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at these motherfuckers in their </v>

906
00:38:35.351 --> 00:38:36.490
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they never do it.</v>

907
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.280
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they show pretty much zero interest when</v>

908
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:41.940
<v Speaker 2>we pass by and that seems striking to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

909
00:38:41.941 --> 00:38:44.770
<v Speaker 2>if we're the top grade of that species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

910
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm a peek over and see what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when I see shack,</v>

911
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:48.454
<v Speaker 2>I go watch shack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I paid to go watch him because he's the </v>

912
00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:51.880
<v Speaker 2>best of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

913
00:38:51.881 --> 00:38:53.440
<v Speaker 2>have a physical space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

914
00:38:53.441 --> 00:38:55.870
<v Speaker 2>maybe have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have part of our breed of humanity.</v>

915
00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:56.943
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that go to brock Lesnar </v>

916
00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.013
<v Speaker 2>just to watch and pick a man over his </v>
<v Speaker 2>head and slam them down on the ground </v>

917
00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.113
<v Speaker 2>because they'd see him hoists some 300 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pound dude over his head and you're </v>

918
00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:07.480
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck?</v>

919
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is that guy?</v>

920
00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:11.200
<v Speaker 2>The same thing as me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm getting my associate's degree</v>

921
00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:14.050
<v Speaker 2>does not 700 monkeys in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like freaking out.</v>

922
00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't believe they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

923
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.100
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like an inspirational movie.</v>

924
00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:20.470
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the whole human experience is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspirational movie.</v>

925
00:39:20.471 --> 00:39:21.340
<v Speaker 2>The monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

926
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:22.463
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like looking at us and like </v>

927
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.670
<v Speaker 2>maybe one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

928
00:39:24.671 --> 00:39:27.450
<v Speaker 2>let's just eat these coconuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

929
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know if they know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

930
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:31.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I really fall apart is when</v>

931
00:39:31.061 --> 00:39:33.070
<v Speaker 2>they don't care as much as we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

932
00:39:33.071 --> 00:39:35.950
<v Speaker 2>if you go to Costa Rica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they care around you all the time.</v>

933
00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:38.080
<v Speaker 2>You go to a stay at a hotel in Costa </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rica,</v>

934
00:39:38.081 --> 00:39:39.760
<v Speaker 2>they always hang around hotels because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people would go,</v>

935
00:39:39.761 --> 00:39:40.630
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the monkey,</v>

936
00:39:40.631 --> 00:39:42.700
<v Speaker 2>and they feed them and is how much to </v>
<v Speaker 2>feed them.</v>

937
00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:46.540
<v Speaker 2>We gave a monkey some oreos like oreo </v>
<v Speaker 2>cookies and we were like,</v>

938
00:39:46.541 --> 00:39:48.130
<v Speaker 2>debating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should we give this monkey oreos?</v>

939
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:49.143
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be like crack for that </v>

940
00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:52.330

<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>

942
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.090

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

943
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.820
<v Speaker 2>I bet that fucking monkey eats oreos all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

944
00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.320
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just keeping one oreo.</v>

945
00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:00.183

<v Speaker 2>We did.</v>

946
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.400
<v Speaker 2>He take the Oreo and he twisted it </v>
<v Speaker 2>opened.</v>

947
00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:03.243
<v Speaker 2>They start eating the frosting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That motherfucker had gotten so many </v>

950
00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Twisted Tyler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you scrape it with your teeth?</v>

951
00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:19.130
<v Speaker 2>We see frosting and then you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>reluctantly eat the cookie like that.</v>

952
00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Hasn't had a little frosting on it </v>

965
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Headache,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nausea,</v>

966
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.890
<v Speaker 2>diarrhea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No monkeys at the window.</v>

967
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>

968
00:40:52.291 --> 00:40:54.610
<v Speaker 2>you're not aware of what it's doing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you either.</v>

969
00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.220
<v Speaker 2>So your kid doesn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do I feel like shit?</v>

970
00:40:57.221 --> 00:40:58.780
<v Speaker 2>They don't like directly put it </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

971
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.410
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just ate a tub of ice cream.</v>

972
00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just eat a tub of ice cream.</v>

973
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:07.090
<v Speaker 2>That's like 50,000 milligrams of sugar </v>
<v Speaker 2>or some shit.</v>

974
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Kids are nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

975
00:41:08.471 --> 00:41:11.590
<v Speaker 2>I think we got to lower some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations on a lot of these children.</v>

976
00:41:11.591 --> 00:41:12.940
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

977
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.940
<v Speaker 2>just to be firm up a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these kids are a lot weaker.</v>

978
00:41:15.941 --> 00:41:17.260
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a child,</v>

979
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:19.540
<v Speaker 2>what kind of regulations are you talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>

980
00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Regulation to beef them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

981
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:24.190
<v Speaker 2>I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

982
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:27.550
<v Speaker 2>younger driving age is younger drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just things that are going to get,</v>

983
00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more experienced.</v>

984
00:41:29.291 --> 00:41:30.220
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

985
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:31.503
<v Speaker 2>well that the problem with the younger </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving age is they're gonna put us in </v>

986
00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:38.900
<v Speaker 2>danger like I think even the age it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

987
00:41:38.901 --> 00:41:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Fifteen and 16.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a little sketchy for some kids.</v>

988
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:44.350
<v Speaker 2>It was definitely sketchy for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a shitty day.</v>

989
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.280
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was like 15,</v>

990
00:41:46.281 --> 00:41:48.540
<v Speaker 2>16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely shouldn't have been driving.</v>

991
00:41:48.541 --> 00:41:51.020
<v Speaker 2>It was too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where were you driving in cars?</v>

992
00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:53.580
<v Speaker 2>I always had muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were that guy you selling drugs or.</v>

995
00:41:55.491 --> 00:41:55.891
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

996
00:41:55.891 --> 00:41:57.710
<v Speaker 2>A wrapped around a tree right in front </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the high school.</v>

997
00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Hydroplaned man had bald tires and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

998
00:42:00.591 --> 00:42:02.870
<v Speaker 2>The water was wet and we were going </v>
<v Speaker 2>around this corner.</v>

999
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.310
<v Speaker 2>My car just just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we're going to slide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did everybody see?</v>

1001
00:42:06.261 --> 00:42:08.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they found my car afterwards,</v>

1002
00:42:08.241 --> 00:42:11.720
<v Speaker 2>so smashed my car in half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cracked the frame and shit.</v>

1003
00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:14.570
<v Speaker 2>You remember the first time you ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>drove off in your car?</v>

1004
00:42:14.571 --> 00:42:15.404
<v Speaker 2>The feeling you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the first time you ever pulled off </v>

1005
00:42:17.331 --> 00:42:18.620
<v Speaker 2>in your vehicle by yourself?</v>

1006
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

1007
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.253
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think I was an irresponsible </v>

1008
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:24.710
<v Speaker 2>driver because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1009
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I was going pedal to the metal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1010
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whether it was a car or there was </v>

1011
00:42:30.201 --> 00:42:31.940
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what is.</v>

1012
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:33.580
<v Speaker 2>That was what I was competing in martial</v>
<v Speaker 2>arts too.</v>

1013
00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.550
<v Speaker 2>It was like I was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't,</v>

1014
00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:40.010
<v Speaker 2>there's no way a kid who's 16 years old </v>
<v Speaker 2>who just started driving,</v>

1015
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.470
<v Speaker 2>she'd be able to get a 400 horsepower </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle cars.</v>

1016
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Much insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too much power.</v>

1017
00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.120
<v Speaker 2>I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no maturity.</v>

1018
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.983
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1019
00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:49.163
<v Speaker 2>I grew up for a broken family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like all this anger issues and </v>

1020
00:42:52.281 --> 00:42:53.840
<v Speaker 2>weird chill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't give someone like that.</v>

1021
00:42:53.841 --> 00:42:55.910
<v Speaker 2>A muscle car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have to have some discipline?</v>

1022
00:42:55.911 --> 00:42:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that you like were pedal to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the metal like that?</v>

1023
00:42:58.411 --> 00:42:59.244
<v Speaker 2>Did you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you realize it in relation to other </v>

1024
00:43:00.171 --> 00:43:01.850
<v Speaker 2>kids or were you just being yourself?</v>

1025
00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:02.900
<v Speaker 2>Is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just being myself,</v>

1026
00:43:02.901 --> 00:43:03.734
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize how crazy I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely felt uncomfortable </v>

1027
00:43:06.051 --> 00:43:08.180
<v Speaker 2>around other kids sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1028
00:43:08.181 --> 00:43:10.670
<v Speaker 2>we moved a lot around a lot though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was attributed to that.</v>

1029
00:43:10.671 --> 00:43:12.500
<v Speaker 2>We'd never looked in one place at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1030
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:14.630
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think in general,</v>

1031
00:43:14.631 --> 00:43:18.800
<v Speaker 2>teenage boys are really risky for a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>

1032
00:43:18.801 --> 00:43:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Like my buddy was talking to me about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this the other day.</v>

1033
00:43:22.191 --> 00:43:23.690
<v Speaker 2>My Buddy Eric Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

1034
00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.640
<v Speaker 2>they're the most dangerous thing in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies,</v>

1035
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.460
<v Speaker 2>teenage boys and I never thought about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1036
00:43:28.461 --> 00:43:31.490
<v Speaker 2>but he's kind of like a teenage daughter</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time.</v>

1037
00:43:31.491 --> 00:43:32.324
<v Speaker 2>She seen edge and we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and he was like the most dangerous </v>

1038
00:43:34.671 --> 00:43:36.050
<v Speaker 2>thing in our society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought about it.</v>

1039
00:43:36.051 --> 00:43:36.441
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1040
00:43:36.441 --> 00:43:39.590
<v Speaker 2>you don't want it is because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have manpower,</v>

1041
00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:40.573
<v Speaker 2>laboy brains and their brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your frontal lobe doesn't even fully </v>

1042
00:43:44.541 --> 00:43:46.730
<v Speaker 2>developed until you're like 25.</v>

1043
00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:47.653
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your total ability to process thoughts </v>

1044
00:43:49.821 --> 00:43:52.350
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like fully functional until you</v>

1045
00:43:52.351 --> 00:43:53.960
<v Speaker 2>look 25.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the middle of it.</v>

1046
00:43:53.961 --> 00:43:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's the middle monkey joe to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1047
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:56.993
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe that kind of maybe like </v>

1048
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:00.583
<v Speaker 2>that's why that whole species died off </v>
<v Speaker 2>if they were here because they were all </v>

1049
00:44:02.541 --> 00:44:04.520
<v Speaker 2>like teenage boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had the boy brain,</v>

1050
00:44:04.521 --> 00:44:09.521
<v Speaker 2>but the man body will let chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chimps are like horrible people.</v>

1051
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:12.110
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is super strong.</v>

1052
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.750
<v Speaker 2>They're strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a 500 pound person and they're</v>

1053
00:44:14.751 --> 00:44:15.770
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>

1054
00:44:15.771 --> 00:44:17.300
<v Speaker 2>vindictive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jealous people.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1056
00:44:18.501 --> 00:44:19.334
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know that chimps punish </v>

1057
00:44:21.081 --> 00:44:24.170
<v Speaker 2>each other too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They punish people to God.</v>

1058
00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.000
<v Speaker 2>They don't just try to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They try to punish you.</v>

1059
00:44:26.001 --> 00:44:28.700
<v Speaker 2>They try to take your fingers away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take your genitals away.</v>

<v Speaker 2>attack you.</v>

1061
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.570

<v Speaker 2>they're smart.</v>

1062
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:36.120
<v Speaker 2>They're super smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not as smart as a person,</v>

1063
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.610
<v Speaker 2>but they're way smarter than a chicken.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1091
00:45:45.921 --> 00:45:46.754
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they try to tear apart the parts of you </v>

1095
00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:54.953
<v Speaker 2>Like they were punishing him for making </v>
<v Speaker 2>them feel bad that they didn't get the </v>

1096
00:45:57.631 --> 00:45:59.970
<v Speaker 2>cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're monsters just heartbreak there.</v>

1097
00:45:59.971 --> 00:46:00.804
<v Speaker 2>They're in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1098
00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:02.520
<v Speaker 2>they look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not always this way,</v>

1099
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:07.110
<v Speaker 2>just like people aren't always monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But chimpanzees inhabit some of the most</v>

1100
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:11.160
<v Speaker 2>terrifying traits and human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a great article recently about</v>

1101
00:46:11.161 --> 00:46:11.994
<v Speaker 2>these chimps and they had this one alpha</v>
<v Speaker 2>male that was teamed up with another </v>

1102
00:46:16.111 --> 00:46:16.944
<v Speaker 2>Alpha male and they dominated this </v>
<v Speaker 2>village and they were horrible and </v>

1103
00:46:19.441 --> 00:46:20.274
<v Speaker 2>ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then one of them got real sick and </v>

1104
00:46:21.781 --> 00:46:24.810
<v Speaker 2>he went away for awhile and came back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was like physically all fucked up</v>

1105
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:30.050
<v Speaker 2>and so the original Alpha team was down </v>
<v Speaker 2>to one guy and this one alpha male,</v>

1106
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.790
<v Speaker 2>they teamed up on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all,</v>

1107
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:36.660
<v Speaker 2>all the other chimps got together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they figured out a way to Jack this dude</v>

1108
00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:41.010
<v Speaker 2>that they attacked him and killed him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then cannibalized him.</v>

1109
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:44.250
<v Speaker 2>They killed him and then cannibalized </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1110
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know they were up till that.</v>

1111
00:46:46.231 --> 00:46:47.550
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I might even go to the zoo now.</v>

1112
00:46:47.551 --> 00:46:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

1113
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.860
<v Speaker 2>it really does give you a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>perception,</v>

1114
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't see that.</v>

1115
00:46:51.241 --> 00:46:52.560
<v Speaker 2>They don't put that on the sign out </v>
<v Speaker 2>front.</v>

1116
00:46:52.561 --> 00:46:53.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just put that there,</v>

1117
00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them are from Africa or Malaysia</v>

1118
00:46:56.201 --> 00:46:59.040
<v Speaker 2>and that they're happy to be there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the zoo,</v>

1119
00:46:59.080 --> 00:46:59.913
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not happy to be there in the </v>

1120
00:47:00.691 --> 00:47:01.720
<v Speaker 2>zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not.</v>

1121
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Would you fight a chimp fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll kill you.</v>

1122
00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:06.360
<v Speaker 2>You have no chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No chance.</v>

1123
00:47:06.361 --> 00:47:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's like a baby?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think a baby and kick your ass?</v>

1124
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.070
<v Speaker 2>Not most babies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1125
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think about a chimp.</v>

1126
00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.480
<v Speaker 2>I think there's not a chance in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chimps going to kill you.</v>

1127
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:17.600
<v Speaker 2>What about this chimp one?</v>

1128
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Arm Chimp either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll still kill you with one arm,</v>

1129
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:22.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might kill me.</v>

1130
00:47:22.081 --> 00:47:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Would you go against him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm know he'll.</v>

1131
00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:24.773
<v Speaker 2>He'll fuck me up too strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you understand how strong </v>

1132
00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.553
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about something that's </v>

1133
00:47:28.621 --> 00:47:31.630
<v Speaker 2>like a 500 pound person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so much stronger than you.</v>

1134
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:32.583
<v Speaker 2>If it gets a hold of you and it will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to pull your arms right out </v>

1135
00:47:34.841 --> 00:47:37.050
<v Speaker 2>of your socket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One arm of norms.</v>

1136
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:38.263
<v Speaker 2>If it's face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to grab a hold of you with </v>

1137
00:47:39.701 --> 00:47:41.690
<v Speaker 2>his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got feet that a thumbs on it.</v>

1138
00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:44.080
<v Speaker 2>It'll hold onto you with its feet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll bite your neck off.</v>

1139
00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You making me nervous?</v>

1140
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did.</v>

1141
00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where we came from.</v>

1142
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're still capable of,</v>

1143
00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:54.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1144
00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:57.650
<v Speaker 2>hand to hand combat to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1145
00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:58.960
<v Speaker 2>because we used to have to probably do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1146
00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:01.660
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be somehow or another in our</v>

1147
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:02.553
<v Speaker 2>ancient primate DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's the question is how did we get </v>

1148
00:48:05.471 --> 00:48:07.120
<v Speaker 2>so far ahead of the rest of them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:48:07.121 --> 00:48:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Something happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something happened and we hit a jump.</v>

1150
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:10.810
<v Speaker 2>We hit a leap year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

1151
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:13.503
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was something occurred where or </v>

1152
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.800
<v Speaker 2>something where we came from the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1153
00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:21.520
<v Speaker 2>It could be just some random mutation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be something that we ate.</v>

1154
00:48:21.521 --> 00:48:24.340
<v Speaker 2>It could be something that hit us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be radiation.</v>

1155
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.233
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terence Mckenna thought it was </v>

1156
00:48:25.991 --> 00:48:26.824
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought people found mushrooms and </v>

1157
00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.150
<v Speaker 2>started eating mushrooms that have made </v>
<v Speaker 2>us evolve at a faster rate.</v>

1158
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Some people have attributed to our diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't totally make sense.</v>

1159
00:48:35.051 --> 00:48:39.100
<v Speaker 2>Some people attributed to our use of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire because when we used fire we cooked</v>

1160
00:48:39.101 --> 00:48:39.934
<v Speaker 2>meat and we got more nutrients out of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that allowed us also to a bit get </v>

1161
00:48:44.201 --> 00:48:45.034
<v Speaker 2>clever and how we kept the fire and use </v>
<v Speaker 2>of throwing tools like spears and shit </v>

1162
00:48:49.091 --> 00:48:52.660
<v Speaker 2>like that or di coordination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women could have made us do it though.</v>

1163
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:55.090
<v Speaker 2>They could have literally been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get your shit together,</v>

1164
00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.560
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we brought it up,</v>

1165
00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:57.730
<v Speaker 2>push pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>

1166
00:48:57.731 --> 00:49:00.310
<v Speaker 2>We had to evolve to keep them around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gone now.</v>

1167
00:49:00.311 --> 00:49:01.144
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No offense if anybody has a puts out </v>

1168
00:49:02.411 --> 00:49:03.244
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think a lot of pussies going down </v>

1169
00:49:03.801 --> 00:49:04.634
<v Speaker 2>hill these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like it's what it used to </v>

1170
00:49:05.681 --> 00:49:06.514
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

1171
00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:11.290
<v Speaker 2>You think so or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's changed?</v>

1172
00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if just the value that they</v>

1173
00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:14.884
<v Speaker 2>put on it or just the fact that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it feels a little bit </v>

1174
00:49:18.161 --> 00:49:19.450
<v Speaker 2>more like a Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit.</v>

1175
00:49:19.451 --> 00:49:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't have the same pussy </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling is that same texture.</v>

1176
00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.200
<v Speaker 2>I think it just doesn't have the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>softness to it.</v>

1177
00:49:26.201 --> 00:49:28.630
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So literally Vaginas have changed you.</v>

1178
00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I think vaginas are getting harder than </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were when we were 30 years.</v>

1179
00:49:32.351 --> 00:49:35.530
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a guess like maybe something's</v>

1180
00:49:35.531 --> 00:49:36.364
<v Speaker 2>going on with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just think it's like a collective </v>

1181
00:49:39.071 --> 00:49:42.730
<v Speaker 2>across the board transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that yeah,</v>

1182
00:49:42.731 --> 00:49:43.564
<v Speaker 2>I think the species are kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>even in an up and that's going to make </v>

1183
00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.030
<v Speaker 2>you don't think so man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny thought.</v>

1184
00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.970
<v Speaker 2>So now they're getting stronger and </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder.</v>

1185
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:51.843
<v Speaker 2>Men are getting weaker because men are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's some other purpose </v>

1186
00:49:54.401 --> 00:49:55.234
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows a lot of men out there just </v>

1187
00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:58.390
<v Speaker 2>crying behind a fucking dairy queen </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

1188
00:49:58.630 --> 00:50:01.840
<v Speaker 2>not knowing what to do with themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are on a show and he's probably.</v>

1189
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:04.150
<v Speaker 2>What's Tony's anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scissor now,</v>

1190
00:50:04.151 --> 00:50:06.560
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As Jamie says,</v>

1191
00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:07.121
<v Speaker 2>we're now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1192
00:50:07.121 --> 00:50:08.140
<v Speaker 2>places like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1193
00:50:08.141 --> 00:50:13.141
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of managers disheartened and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that they just not the same.</v>

1194
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.690
<v Speaker 2>What is the instinct because there's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>instinct from males are.</v>

1195
00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:20.410
<v Speaker 2>And so to put women down and to hold </v>
<v Speaker 2>their significant other down,</v>

1196
00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:24.220
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an instinct that women have to,</v>

1197
00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:27.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diminish a man's manliness and to like,</v>

1198
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.470
<v Speaker 2>it's not always the emasculate them </v>
<v Speaker 2>demasculate,</v>

1199
00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:30.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1200
00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Or masculinity masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not a,</v>

1201
00:50:32.331 --> 00:50:34.170
<v Speaker 2>it's not all of them for sure know when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done,</v>

1202
00:50:34.171 --> 00:50:35.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm talking about,</v>

1203
00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.460
<v Speaker 2>we all know that they exist on both </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides,</v>

1204
00:50:37.461 --> 00:50:40.790
<v Speaker 2>on the male side and the women's side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people that did not try to pump you</v>

1205
00:50:40.791 --> 00:50:41.720
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they trying to shoot you down.</v>

1206
00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what is that instinct,</v>

1207
00:50:43.551 --> 00:50:44.384
<v Speaker 2>that instinct in the women that some </v>
<v Speaker 2>that some women have to try to like </v>

1208
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:48.560
<v Speaker 2>diminish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You try to chip,</v>

1209
00:50:48.561 --> 00:50:49.520
<v Speaker 2>chip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chip away at you.</v>

1210
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.013
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they have more man and maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a little more man in them and so </v>

1211
00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:55.900
<v Speaker 2>they're more pitch and they look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucking,</v>

1212
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:58.580
<v Speaker 2>you're such a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have any heart.</v>

1213
00:50:58.581 --> 00:51:00.680
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any cards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like almost challenging you.</v>

1214
00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost want you to smack them.</v>

1215
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:04.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

1216
00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:05.693
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure a couple of years have started </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way util the murders started for </v>

1217
00:51:08.661 --> 00:51:10.400
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the cops say,</v>

1218
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:12.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the scariest thing they faced.</v>

1219
00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Domestic violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1220
00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Because you might like find a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting a girl.</v>

1221
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:19.820
<v Speaker 2>You might pull the guy off and the girl </v>
<v Speaker 2>might shoot you or various diverse.</v>

1222
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is in a woman that </v>

1223
00:51:21.591 --> 00:51:21.860
<v Speaker 2>does that.</v>

1224
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe there's probably some of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1225
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:25.223
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at some they were probably done </v>

1226
00:51:27.261 --> 00:51:31.130
<v Speaker 2>wrong by a man previously and that some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that still probably resonate.</v>

1227
00:51:31.131 --> 00:51:31.964
<v Speaker 2>Send them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1228
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:33.463
<v Speaker 2>because some women do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want to just make you feel </v>

1229
00:51:35.811 --> 00:51:37.230
<v Speaker 2>nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1230
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:39.470
<v Speaker 2>they want to make you feel nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate that.</v>

1231
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think it's also how the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you raised,</v>

1232
00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:42.433
<v Speaker 2>like if you watch your mom and dad </v>
<v Speaker 2>insult each other and yell shit at each </v>

1233
00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:48.050
<v Speaker 2>other becomes ingrained in your system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1234
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Well I think it's fascinating how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn into our parents,</v>

1235
00:51:50.991 --> 00:51:52.550
<v Speaker 2>even though everybody says they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to.</v>

1236
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:53.533
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always interesting to me is how a </v>

1237
00:51:54.801 --> 00:51:56.300
<v Speaker 2>lot of people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1238
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:58.280
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people definitely do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easier.</v>

1239
00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Certainly easier than becoming your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1240
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Becoming your own person requires a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of thought.</v>

1241
00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.330
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people want to think anymore,</v>

1242
00:52:05.331 --> 00:52:06.164
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wonder if people ever wanted to </v>

1243
00:52:07.311 --> 00:52:08.144
<v Speaker 2>thank you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is probably the smartest </v>

1244
00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:10.760
<v Speaker 2>conversation I've been involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may be months.</v>

1245
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:14.083
<v Speaker 2>It really is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most I've talked to anybody </v>

1246
00:52:15.291 --> 00:52:16.400
<v Speaker 2>in a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1247
00:52:16.401 --> 00:52:21.401
<v Speaker 2>I think people want to think but it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>scary and it's a lot of work.</v>

1248
00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:24.200
<v Speaker 2>It hurts her head sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1249
00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.153
<v Speaker 2>didn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your parents were like real old when </v>

1250
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:29.240
<v Speaker 2>they had you write your dad was he and </v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad was.</v>

1251
00:52:29.241 --> 00:52:32.090
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was 70 when I was born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1252
00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was born in 1910.</v>

1253
00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit Dude.</v>

1254
00:52:35.211 --> 00:52:38.060
<v Speaker 2>You're from a different era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got different genes.</v>

1255
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:39.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometime I do think I'll feel a little </v>

1256
00:52:40.161 --> 00:52:42.110
<v Speaker 2>more tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel a little bit.</v>

1257
00:52:42.111 --> 00:52:42.944
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I mean.</v>

1258
00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he got like a,</v>

1259
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:47.460
<v Speaker 2>like early human genes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1260
00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:48.453
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're a direct descendant from </v>

1261
00:52:49.551 --> 00:52:51.650
<v Speaker 2>someone who was born in 19.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh nine.</v>

1262
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know my jeans.</v>

1263
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 49.</v>

1264
00:52:55.491 --> 00:52:55.881
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.810
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to have something to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1299
00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:17.003
<v Speaker 3>and then you had to create a story too </v>
<v Speaker 3>because people would ask if that was </v>

1300
00:54:19.891 --> 00:54:22.020
<v Speaker 3>your dad and you didn't want to admit </v>

1310
00:54:39.181 --> 00:54:40.450
<v Speaker 3>but maybe that's where I started making </v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1311
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:42.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>kind of I'll get to the credit card </v>

1320
00:54:59.491 --> 00:55:01.620
<v Speaker 3>colleges at the credit card when you go </v>

<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1354
00:56:19.681 --> 00:56:20.514
<v Speaker 3>I think it's all blessing adversity of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the experience as a child that doesn't </v>

1359
00:56:29.381 --> 00:56:30.214
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes I still resonate with </v>

1360
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:32.890
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the feelings that it has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>child.</v>

1361
00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.400
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1362
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:36.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm still getting through some of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1365
00:56:41.771 --> 00:56:42.604
<v Speaker 3>that a little bit more and I know it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening and it does make me realize </v>

1366
00:56:45.641 --> 00:56:48.130
<v Speaker 3>more now that the saddest thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world really is a,</v>

1367
00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:51.730
<v Speaker 3>is when a kid doesn't really have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>chance or an opportunity or you know,</v>

1368
00:56:51.731 --> 00:56:53.560
<v Speaker 3>like you said something physically </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to him,</v>

1369

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's bad.</v>

1370
00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:56.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the saddest things in the </v>

1371
00:56:57.161 --> 00:56:59.590
<v Speaker 3>world for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1373
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:03.220
<v Speaker 3>that was the wild part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's what it got me into this,</v>

1374
00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:04.510
<v Speaker 3>in doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1375
00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.373
<v Speaker 3>I mean I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am grateful now because I'm able to </v>

1376
00:57:06.821 --> 00:57:09.820
<v Speaker 3>look back on it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and talk about it.</v>

1399
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:09.140
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he was doing,</v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I speak Spanish.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he spoke Spanish.</v>

1402
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:12.363
<v Speaker 3>He was nice man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember a ton about them </v>

1403
00:58:14.111 --> 00:58:14.944
<v Speaker 3>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've wished as I was just getting old </v>

1404
00:58:15.941 --> 00:58:19.180
<v Speaker 3>enough it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was falling out,</v>

1405
00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:20.043
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do remember being scared a lot of </v>

1406
00:58:23.081 --> 00:58:24.790
<v Speaker 3>my feelings when I was younger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just fear man.</v>

1407
00:58:24.791 --> 00:58:28.690
<v Speaker 3>I remember like my dad would walk me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>church sometimes and um,</v>

1408
00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:33.730
<v Speaker 3>and I would be scared because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sidewalks in Louisiana there,</v>

1409
00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:34.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of routes that are coming </v>

1410
00:58:35.681 --> 00:58:36.600
<v Speaker 3>up and this bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1411
00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:40.030
<v Speaker 3>it's under sea level a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all the sidewalks are all wonky.</v>

1412
00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:40.893
<v Speaker 3>It's not even a walk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really just a challenge of pieces </v>

1413
00:58:42.551 --> 00:58:44.280
<v Speaker 3>of concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really look at it.</v>

1414
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:48.790
<v Speaker 3>I never thought about it before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but through this whole wall,</v>

1415
00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.053
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of sidewalks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda cool to see those roots </v>

1416
00:58:51.731 --> 00:58:54.550
<v Speaker 3>struggling against concrete know it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>ballsy.</v>

1417
00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:56.230
<v Speaker 3>It's ballsy for mother nature to be out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1418
00:58:56.231 --> 00:58:59.140
<v Speaker 3>This pressing up against those plates </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that and moving them.</v>

1419
00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:00.083
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And moving them.</v>

1420
00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what was weird when I remember being</v>

1421
00:59:02.321 --> 00:59:05.560
<v Speaker 3>a kid was walking and just being scared </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was going to like fall.</v>

1422
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.360
<v Speaker 3>And so it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just remember always being gay or just</v>

1423
00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.310
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1424
00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.153
<v Speaker 3>and then I was such a kid and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just remember this from my first </v>

1425
00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:17.140
<v Speaker 3>feelings were like I got to make you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1426
00:59:17.141 --> 00:59:19.630
<v Speaker 3>just make sure he where he's walking is </v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1427
00:59:19.631 --> 00:59:21.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was probably six years old,</v>

1428
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:22.310
<v Speaker 3>so it was just a lot of fear</v>

1429
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.400
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then shame I,</v>

1430
00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:28.070
<v Speaker 2>I became ashamed in hindsight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad about that.</v>

1431
00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's understandable.</v>

1432
00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:33.470
<v Speaker 2>And when you're a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1433
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.270
<v Speaker 2>It's all confusing to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1434
00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:37.220
<v Speaker 2>why doesn't my dad looked like the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid's dad?</v>

1435
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:39.980
<v Speaker 2>Why do I have to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does this have to happen to me?</v>

1436
00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1437
00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I stayed with my grandpa when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>first moving to New York.</v>

1438
00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't afford my own place when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>moved from Boston and New York and I got</v>

1439
00:59:50.241 --> 00:59:52.130
<v Speaker 2>signed by my manager and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1440
00:59:52.131 --> 00:59:53.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to move to New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to happen.</v>

1441
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:54.980
<v Speaker 2>How to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I make the money?</v>

1442
00:59:54.981 --> 00:59:56.030
<v Speaker 2>And My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandfather said,</v>

1443
00:59:56.031 --> 00:59:56.864
<v Speaker 2>you can come stay with me for awhile </v>
<v Speaker 2>until you save up enough money for an </v>

1444
00:59:59.181 --> 01:00:00.014
<v Speaker 2>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandfather lived in New Jersey and </v>

1445
01:00:02.451 --> 01:00:03.284
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a very important moment in my </v>

1446
01:00:06.261 --> 01:00:09.950
<v Speaker 2>life to stay with them for a few months </v>
<v Speaker 2>because my grandfather was,</v>

1447
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:11.360
<v Speaker 2>he was getting old.</v>

1448
01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.373
<v Speaker 2>He was and my grandmother was almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead because my grandmother had had a </v>

1449
01:00:14.661 --> 01:00:17.660
<v Speaker 2>stroke and they had given her 12 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>to live.</v>

1450
01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:19.070
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or excuse me,</v>

1451
01:00:19.071 --> 01:00:21.770
<v Speaker 2>they'd given her 78 hours to live what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to live in 12 years.</v>

1452
01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.371
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1453
01:00:22.371 --> 01:00:23.204
<v Speaker 2>They thought it was over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought the stroke is going to do </v>

1454
01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:26.240
<v Speaker 2>her in a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's probably going to be gone.</v>

1455
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:28.790
<v Speaker 2>They found her in the back porch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a really sad story.</v>

1456
01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.073
<v Speaker 2>She lived though and there was even </v>
<v Speaker 2>sadder that way because she was in pain </v>

1457
01:00:32.991 --> 01:00:33.824
<v Speaker 2>and she would get bedsores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandfather had a 10 to 24 hours a </v>

1458
01:00:36.321 --> 01:00:39.650
<v Speaker 2>day and I was staying with him during </v>
<v Speaker 2>this time.</v>

1459
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:40.543
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for a few months I was staying with </v>

1460
01:00:42.351 --> 01:00:44.780
<v Speaker 2>my grandmother who was on death's door </v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

1461
01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:48.650
<v Speaker 2>She lived like a year or so after I </v>
<v Speaker 2>moved out and she wasn't really aware of</v>

1462
01:00:48.651 --> 01:00:49.280
<v Speaker 2>me anymore.</v>

1463
01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.113
<v Speaker 2>She was not quite there anymore and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfather who was struggling to take </v>

1464
01:00:53.511 --> 01:00:55.180
<v Speaker 2>care of her and just seemed sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1465
01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.290
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1466
01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.153
<v Speaker 2>this life is temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this experience that I'm </v>

1467
01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:04.130
<v Speaker 2>experiencing right now is a 24 year old </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1468
01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Like this is not going to last like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the prime of my youth.</v>

1469
01:01:08.421 --> 01:01:12.770
<v Speaker 2>And I like hard in my ideas that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to get going,</v>

1470
01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:14.690
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to happen to you too.</v>

1471
01:01:14.691 --> 01:01:16.260
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen to all of us and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1472
01:01:16.261 --> 01:01:17.094
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think that you're this static thing </v>

1473
01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.460
<v Speaker 2>like you stay in this same exact state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not true.</v>

1474
01:01:22.461 --> 01:01:23.294
<v Speaker 2>It's an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those people that you see that are </v>

1475
01:01:25.161 --> 01:01:25.994
<v Speaker 2>old people that are walking down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street with their back's hunched over </v>

1476
01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:30.770
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to reach that age some</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

1477
01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:31.663
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't pay attention and it </v>

1478
01:01:33.621 --> 01:01:36.320
<v Speaker 2>all goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could wind up looking like that guy.</v>

1479
01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.080
<v Speaker 2>You could wind up thinking and behaving </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that guy.</v>

1480
01:01:39.081 --> 01:01:41.750
<v Speaker 2>It is a slow ebbing of the life force of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body.</v>

1481
01:01:41.751 --> 01:01:44.510
<v Speaker 2>If it's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna Drain you so God dammit.</v>

1482
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Get your fun out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get your life out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You got to live.</v>

1484
01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:53.120
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking coming and you got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember because if you don't remember,</v>

1485
01:01:53.121 --> 01:01:54.980
<v Speaker 2>you're going to sleep in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't remember,</v>

1486
01:01:54.981 --> 01:01:56.780
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get anything done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't remember,</v>

1487
01:01:56.781 --> 01:01:57.920
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not gonna.</v>

1488
01:01:57.921 --> 01:01:58.754
<v Speaker 2>Have the same focus and determination </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would have with the </v>

1489
01:02:01.701 --> 01:02:04.250
<v Speaker 2>understanding that this is a temporary </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

1490
01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

1491
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:06.650
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be able to alert,</v>

1492
01:02:06.651 --> 01:02:07.960
<v Speaker 2>you are able to learn that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1493
01:02:07.961 --> 01:02:11.240
<v Speaker 2>like not saying that that moment kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>helped culminate.</v>

1494
01:02:11.241 --> 01:02:12.074
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it helped definitely helped some </v>

1495
01:02:13.221 --> 01:02:14.600
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just hard to learn.</v>

1496
01:02:14.601 --> 01:02:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Why is it so hard?</v>

1497
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes for us hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1498
01:02:17.031 --> 01:02:17.864
<v Speaker 2>even when I got out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably forgot it when I got my own </v>

1499
01:02:19.951 --> 01:02:20.784
<v Speaker 2>apartment and started living normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably like let it slip for a little </v>

1500
01:02:22.621 --> 01:02:23.370
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1501
01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:24.203
<v Speaker 2>I mean I definitely went through some </v>
<v Speaker 2>moments in my own life where I lost my </v>

1502
01:02:26.131 --> 01:02:29.850
<v Speaker 2>motivation and my point of view or got </v>
<v Speaker 2>lazy or lost my perspective,</v>

1503
01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:31.283
<v Speaker 2>but I've figured out the consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and I always bounced it back as </v>

1504
01:02:33.691 --> 01:02:34.524
<v Speaker 2>best as I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just remember those few months </v>

1505
01:02:36.871 --> 01:02:39.390
<v Speaker 2>that I lived with my grandfather being </v>
<v Speaker 2>real important.</v>

1506
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.213
<v Speaker 2>Real important too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he lived in a neighborhood that </v>

1507
01:02:42.901 --> 01:02:44.360
<v Speaker 2>was real bad man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1508
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.010
<v Speaker 2>it was north ninth street in Newark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey.</v>

1509
01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Sounds horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1510
01:02:48.301 --> 01:02:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never even been there.</v>

1511
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.570
<v Speaker 2>It was great at one time when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1512
01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.633
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it was all families that had all </v>

1513
01:02:54.721 --> 01:02:56.900
<v Speaker 2>moved to this neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thugs.</v>

1514
01:02:58.410 --> 01:02:59.243
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what had happened was they did this </v>

1515
01:03:00.661 --> 01:03:02.550
<v Speaker 2>thing called blockbusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come around and say,</v>

1516
01:03:02.551 --> 01:03:03.384
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black people are moving into your </v>

1517
01:03:03.721 --> 01:03:05.010
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to sell now.</v>

1518
01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.113
<v Speaker 2>And everybody sold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandfather didn't like black people </v>

1519
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:09.863
<v Speaker 2>to fuck off my lawn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of those things because real </v>

1520
01:03:11.311 --> 01:03:12.144
<v Speaker 2>estate agents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would do that and just turn these </v>

1521
01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:16.260
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods over and just make </v>
<v Speaker 2>profits.</v>

1522
01:03:16.261 --> 01:03:18.150
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1523
01:03:18.151 --> 01:03:18.984
<v Speaker 2>and then it changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went from a black neighborhood to a </v>

1524
01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:21.564
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rican neighborhood and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bunch of different kinds of </v>

1525
01:03:23.881 --> 01:03:25.220
<v Speaker 2>immigrants and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all,</v>

1526
01:03:25.221 --> 01:03:28.560
<v Speaker 2>it's all kind of the same cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all trying to come to America.</v>

1527
01:03:28.561 --> 01:03:29.394
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to establish themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the place where they get </v>

1528
01:03:30.901 --> 01:03:32.790
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was a lot of crime.</v>

1529
01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:34.620
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kinda dangerous.</v>

1530
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:38.900
<v Speaker 2>The next door neighbor was selling crack</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they battering rammed his door.</v>

1531
01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:39.763
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1532
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.490
<v Speaker 2>I think something happened while I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1533
01:03:41.491 --> 01:03:45.050
<v Speaker 2>but the big raid was before I got there </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I got there.</v>

1534
01:03:45.051 --> 01:03:45.884
<v Speaker 2>This guy had like barriers in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his house gates and he had an Audi in </v>

1535
01:03:48.811 --> 01:03:50.760
<v Speaker 2>the driveway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was selling crack.</v>

1536
01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.090
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right next door.</v>

1537
01:03:52.091 --> 01:03:52.924
<v Speaker 3>It is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always that one house and like </v>

1538
01:03:53.651 --> 01:03:55.460
<v Speaker 3>the crappy neighborhood that has all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's like,</v>

1539
01:03:55.461 --> 01:03:57.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like obviously it stands out.</v>

1540
01:03:57.250 --> 01:04:00.370
<v Speaker 3>Something's going on the statues of </v>
<v Speaker 3>lions out front and stuff.</v>

1541
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:02.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1542
01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:03.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think having a dad like that </v>

1543
01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:09.210
<v Speaker 2>must've given you a different sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cycle of life,</v>

1544
01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:11.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of having a young vital dad,</v>

1545
01:04:11.551 --> 01:04:13.590
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad so healthy and he's my hero.</v>

1546
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.510
<v Speaker 2>You grew up going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy shit.</v>

1547
01:04:15.511 --> 01:04:17.250
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was not much time left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1548
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:19.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1549
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:21.130
<v Speaker 3>I think it just made me scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

1550
01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:24.040
<v Speaker 3>it just made me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1551
01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:25.143
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made my sense of humor really dark </v>

1552
01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:31.680
<v Speaker 3>because I remember like my mom would ask</v>
<v Speaker 3>us if my dad was still alive or not,</v>

1553
01:04:32.531 --> 01:04:33.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and make us check on him like,</v>

1554
01:04:33.821 --> 01:04:36.760
<v Speaker 3>around dinner before I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember having,</v>

1555
01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:37.653
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember my brother would sometimes </v>

1556
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:41.960
<v Speaker 3>hold like a mirror under his nose as he </v>
<v Speaker 3>would fog up,</v>

1557
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:43.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to see if we would,</v>

1558
01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:45.250
<v Speaker 3>if my mom would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1559
01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:46.600
<v Speaker 3>and then we just tell mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1560
01:04:46.601 --> 01:04:47.470
<v Speaker 3>he's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1561
01:04:47.471 --> 01:04:49.270
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my mom wasn't very caring.</v>

1562
01:04:49.271 --> 01:04:50.830
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a good woman,</v>

1563
01:04:50.831 --> 01:04:53.380
<v Speaker 3>she's a hard working woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She delivered newspapers,</v>

1564
01:04:53.381 --> 01:04:54.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her whole life,</v>

1565
01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.770
<v Speaker 3>but she just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1566
01:04:56.771 --> 01:04:59.290
<v Speaker 3>maybe she was angry that she felt fallen</v>
<v Speaker 3>for this older man.</v>

1567
01:04:59.291 --> 01:04:59.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1568
01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.540
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1569
01:05:01.541 --> 01:05:02.291
<v Speaker 3>It was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1570
01:05:02.291 --> 01:05:03.520
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1571
01:05:03.521 --> 01:05:04.354
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't develop much of a relationship </v>

1572
01:05:05.681 --> 01:05:06.514
<v Speaker 3>for them with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I just develop moments that I </v>

1573
01:05:09.011 --> 01:05:14.011
<v Speaker 3>remember that I kind of pieced together </v>
<v Speaker 3>that create the relationship that I felt</v>

1574
01:05:15.251 --> 01:05:16.210
<v Speaker 3>like we had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

1575
01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:19.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like treasurer about 10 or 15 moments.</v>

1576
01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:20.973
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then in hindsight he let me drive </v>

1577
01:05:23.051 --> 01:05:24.280
<v Speaker 3>when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1578
01:05:24.281 --> 01:05:25.114
<v Speaker 3>he kind of took advantage of me a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit like you would drive them to </v>

1579
01:05:26.921 --> 01:05:31.780
<v Speaker 3>colleges when I entered to due to credit</v>
<v Speaker 3>card stuff when I was 12 and 13,</v>

1580
01:05:31.781 --> 01:05:33.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tall enough to drive.</v>

1581
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:37.390
<v Speaker 3>So I'm driving 70 on the interstate man </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit dude.</v>

1582
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:38.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he didn't.</v>

1583
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:39.703
<v Speaker 3>And in hindsight it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made me think that everything was </v>

1584
01:05:41.381 --> 01:05:42.100
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like uh,</v>

1585
01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:43.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life doesn't,</v>

1586
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:44.621
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1587
01:05:44.621 --> 01:05:46.780
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know like who care,</v>

1588
01:05:46.781 --> 01:05:47.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1589
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:48.970
<v Speaker 3>Everything's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1590
01:05:48.971 --> 01:05:51.340
<v Speaker 3>like it doesn't matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1591
01:05:51.341 --> 01:05:53.380
<v Speaker 3>like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kids can do adult stuff,</v>

1592
01:05:53.381 --> 01:05:55.030
<v Speaker 3>adults can do kid stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1593
01:05:55.031 --> 01:05:57.910
<v Speaker 3>there's no real lines in the sand there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1594
01:05:57.911 --> 01:06:01.210
<v Speaker 3>So there wasn't like a moment where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>felt like finally you were grown up,</v>

1595
01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.280
<v Speaker 3>like you just doing the same shit you </v>
<v Speaker 3>always did.</v>

1596
01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:05.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you started driving at 12?</v>

1597
01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:06.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember driving my dad to come to </v>

1598
01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.510
<v Speaker 3>these colleges and he was 82 at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1599
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:13.180
<v Speaker 3>He was 82.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember one time dropping them at the</v>

1600
01:06:13.181 --> 01:06:15.130
<v Speaker 3>post office did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said there's nowhere to park,</v>

1601
01:06:15.131 --> 01:06:16.630
<v Speaker 3>just go around the block,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1602
01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:19.420
<v Speaker 3>So I went around the block and he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a delta 88.</v>

1603
01:06:19.421 --> 01:06:20.970
<v Speaker 3>He bought it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

1604
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.033
<v Speaker 3>of brothers and his April had speakers </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the back and one of them had broken </v>

1605
01:06:24.551 --> 01:06:28.840
<v Speaker 3>out and had a bunch of Chinese food and </v>

1654
01:08:17.421 --> 01:08:19.460
<v Speaker 2>was a black bird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like four years old and he thought</v>

1655
01:08:19.461 --> 01:08:21.290
<v Speaker 2>it was a black man because he couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn his neck.</v>

1656
01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.810
<v Speaker 2>So he was like yelling all these racial </v>
<v Speaker 2>slurs.</v>

1657
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're just going to get some towels.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that were just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1660
01:08:30.531 --> 01:08:32.720
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't turn his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's one of the things I remember</v>

1661
01:08:32.721 --> 01:08:33.860
<v Speaker 2>most about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1662
01:08:34.190 --> 01:08:36.050
<v Speaker 2>I remember you had change in his pockets</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>

1663
01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.010
<v Speaker 2>He liked to whistle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He slept on the couch,</v>

1664
01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some parents kiss one time my dad kissed</v>

1665
01:08:42.891 --> 01:08:45.350
<v Speaker 2>my mother on the head one time at one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our birthdays.</v>

1666
01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:46.390
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1667
01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one time.</v>

1668
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:49.490
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know,</v>

1669
01:08:49.491 --> 01:08:50.324
<v Speaker 2>I feel like when we started to grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother became a little bit </v>

1670
01:08:51.921 --> 01:08:55.790
<v Speaker 2>embarrassed maybe almost to us that our </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad was at age.</v>

1671
01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:59.720
<v Speaker 2>What makes sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if she was like 40 and he was 80.</v>

1672
01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1673
01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.670
<v Speaker 2>she's 46 when he died of old age </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially.</v>

1674
01:09:04.671 --> 01:09:05.504
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might have a disease or cancer or </v>

1675
01:09:06.801 --> 01:09:07.550
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you,</v>

1676
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:08.383
<v Speaker 2>once you hit around 86,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like that's the age where </v>

1677
01:09:11.511 --> 01:09:14.900
<v Speaker 2>everybody starts to go over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1678
01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that was some of it.</v>

1679
01:09:16.251 --> 01:09:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to be a debbie downer.</v>

1680
01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1681
01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:18.733
<v Speaker 2>You're not a Debbie Downer and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>being honest and talking about your </v>

1682
01:09:21.771 --> 01:09:23.270
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty fascinating man.</v>

1683
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:24.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1684
01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:25.323
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've kind of talked about this quite a </v>

1685
01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:28.760
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a,</v>

1686
01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:32.810
<v Speaker 2>we all have these ideas of like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life is supposed to be like.</v>

1687
01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:33.953
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of them are based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>movies were based on like a movie </v>

1688
01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:39.140
<v Speaker 2>version of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>well that's how it happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

1690
01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.350
<v Speaker 2>That's how it's supposed to go down in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>

1691
01:09:42.351 --> 01:09:45.260
<v Speaker 2>And why isn't it happening in my life </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it happens in the movie,</v>

1692
01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.980
<v Speaker 2>but then when you talk to people like </v>

1721
01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:54.873
<v Speaker 2>try and experiencing through her words </v>
<v Speaker 2>what she had to go through and why she </v>

1722
01:10:56.991 --> 01:10:57.824
<v Speaker 2>became who she is now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't make a person like </v>

1724
01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Like if you don't come out that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they had a normal childhood.</v>

1725
01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:07.093

<v Speaker 2>those people out of that regular life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to make a thiel Vaughn </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1732
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:26.730
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting thing because most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my life or my youth especially,</v>

1733
01:11:26.731 --> 01:11:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I pined for that regular or this idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it was,</v>

1734
01:11:30.151 --> 01:11:30.984
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something we saw on television or </v>

<v Speaker 2>I think it was sam.</v>

1741
01:11:46.341 --> 01:11:46.650
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

1742
01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:50.580
<v Speaker 2>Patrick Duffy might be Patrick Duffy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>

1743
01:11:50.581 --> 01:11:51.414
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a show called the man from Atlantis was </v>

1744
01:11:54.211 --> 01:11:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Patrick Duffy who was in what show was </v>
<v Speaker 2>he in?</v>

1745
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:59.270
<v Speaker 2>He was in one of those step by step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1746
01:11:59.271 --> 01:12:00.570
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was one before that.</v>

1747
01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:03.030
<v Speaker 2>There was a big time show that he was in</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1748
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:06.780
<v Speaker 2>It was like a superstar before he did </v>
<v Speaker 2>the man for the last.</v>

1749
01:12:06.930 --> 01:12:08.490
<v Speaker 2>It's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>

1750
01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Breathe under water and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>

1751
01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:13.980
<v Speaker 2>it was like on TV when I was a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

1752
01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this God,</v>

1753
01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:16.961
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1754
01:12:16.961 --> 01:12:18.180
<v Speaker 2>I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was stupid.</v>

1755
01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:21.780
<v Speaker 2>What year was that on 77.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 78.</v>

1756
01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:23.873
<v Speaker 2>10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 10 years old and he was swimming </v>

1757
01:12:25.651 --> 01:12:27.930
<v Speaker 2>in the water and breathing under water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a fish.</v>

1758
01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Like he would keep his legs together </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he would swim.</v>

1759
01:12:30.301 --> 01:12:32.250
<v Speaker 2>He had this weird way of swimming </v>
<v Speaker 2>underwater.</v>

1760
01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I used to swim in a pool.</v>

1761
01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:35.184
<v Speaker 2>I still try to swim Atlantis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually like an effective way to </v>

1762
01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:41.970
<v Speaker 2>swim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like he would swim like,</v>

1763
01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:43.740
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a dolphin.</v>

1764
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Like he would get in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

1765
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:48.270
<v Speaker 2>Is that him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that him from way back then?</v>

1766
01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:49.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1767
01:12:49.301 --> 01:12:50.610
<v Speaker 2>That's from the show look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1768
01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:51.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was always in very good shape and </v>

1769
01:12:53.971 --> 01:12:58.590
<v Speaker 2>they would have him swim against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dolphin and he was faster than it off.</v>

1770
01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Look how stupid that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Homeland was a.</v>

1771
01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:05.700
<v Speaker 2>This show is so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's faster than a dolphin.</v>

1772
01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:09.200
<v Speaker 2>I think I saw that real contest like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this in Arkansas.</v>

1773
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:10.183
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to shoot it out of the water </v>

1774
01:13:11.671 --> 01:13:13.530
<v Speaker 2>and grabbed the fish with the dolphin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't get to it.</v>

1775
01:13:13.531 --> 01:13:14.430
<v Speaker 2>This was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1776
01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:15.323
<v Speaker 2>flies up in the air 30 feet out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water and then he gave the fish to the </v>

1777
01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:28.410
<v Speaker 2>dolphin because he's even better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dolphin.</v>

1778
01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that show would make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

1779
01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.233
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should do it today with the exact </v>

1780
01:13:32.401 --> 01:13:33.234
<v Speaker 2>same scenes and the exact stage put on </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy central will be fucking </v>

1782
01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:38.820
<v Speaker 2>But he would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't a race,</v>

1783
01:13:38.821 --> 01:13:39.654
<v Speaker 2>but there was other times when you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>him swim underwater and gyrate his body </v>

1784
01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:45.300
<v Speaker 2>like a dolphin would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:12.843
<v Speaker 2>Wars.</v>

01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:41.490
<v Speaker 2>It's not star wars either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's Captain Kirk first.</v>

1836
01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Is this a green alien dude that moves </v>
<v Speaker 2>and super slow Mo.</v>

1837
01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:46.493
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at him.</v>

1838
01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:47.613
<v Speaker 2>He's Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1839
01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:48.453
<v Speaker 2>Here comes the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The car hits him with some terrible </v>

1840
01:15:50.501 --> 01:15:53.140
<v Speaker 2>punch to the body here comes to right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A terrible karate chop.</v>

1841
01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:54.910
<v Speaker 2>This is so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at him.</v>

1842
01:15:54.911 --> 01:15:56.470
<v Speaker 2>He's got crazy eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's reaching for him.</v>

1843
01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:57.960
<v Speaker 2>It didn't happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

1844
01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Throws a kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh good move.</v>

1845
01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:00.873
<v Speaker 2>Shitty ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the green monster obviously knows a </v>

1846
01:16:03.491 --> 01:16:06.340
<v Speaker 2>little bit of moitai because you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>got him on a single leg dump.</v>

1847
01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Didn't even trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't bother the trip.</v>

1848
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Just severe strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just thrown through the air.</v>

1849
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:13.750
<v Speaker 2>But meanwHile this is how inconsistent </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are right now.</v>

1850
01:16:13.751 --> 01:16:15.820
<v Speaker 2>They're battling no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>

1851
01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:16.953
<v Speaker 2>the green monster is not overpower them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to bite them wearing a </v>

1852
01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:21.370
<v Speaker 2>dress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or is that a uh,</v>

1853
01:16:21.371 --> 01:16:23.720
<v Speaker 2>probably something's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

1854
01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:27.870
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile he's having a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 2>battling it out with shafting.</v>

1855
01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:28.421
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snack.</v>

1856
01:16:28.421 --> 01:16:30.330
<v Speaker 2>They're double fucking palms into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ears.</v>

1857
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:32.680
<v Speaker 2>the double pump to the ears is always a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good move.</v>

1858
01:16:32.681 --> 01:16:35.430
<v Speaker 2>When you're fighting monsters calling </v>
<v Speaker 2>this man,</v>

1859
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:37.030
<v Speaker 2>check this shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where it gets really stupid.</v>

1860
01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:40.390
<v Speaker 2>He picks up this fake rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously fake rock.</v>

1861
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He pretends he's trained in way.</v>

1862
01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:42.913
<v Speaker 2>Gets it by you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna hit you with this fake rock </v>

1863
01:16:45.131 --> 01:16:47.430
<v Speaker 2>and it's gonna fucking kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And look at this beautiful man.</v>

1864
01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:48.680
<v Speaker 2>He was back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look how he throws it.</v>

1865
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Bomb look as stupid as it bounces off </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1866
01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:54.250
<v Speaker 2>So how come he can hit him with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking double pump to the head?</v>

1867
01:16:54.251 --> 01:16:56.020
<v Speaker 2>And it's like the most devastating blow </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

1868
01:16:56.410 --> 01:16:58.540
<v Speaker 2>But that rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing you.</v>

1869
01:16:58.610 --> 01:17:02.050
<v Speaker 2>They're so inconsistent with his ability</v>
<v Speaker 2>to generate force.</v>

1870
01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.153
<v Speaker 2>The religion jones' a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you say you think she's had </v>

1871
01:17:06.791 --> 01:17:07.624
<v Speaker 2>enough?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll get it.</v>

1872
01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:10.490
<v Speaker 2>He's going to pick up a fake rock now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh you motherfucker.</v>

1873
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:12.080
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

1874
01:17:12.081 --> 01:17:13.940
<v Speaker 3>you throw a rock at me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

1875
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:16.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to throw a fake rock at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And kirk's like,</v>

1876
01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:18.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm out of here bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And see runs out of the way.</v>

1877
01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:21.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just just shy away from that rock.</v>

1878
01:17:21.711 --> 01:17:25.190
<v Speaker 3>You can't hit me with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so now what happens?</v>

1879
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:28.730
<v Speaker 3>Nothing just get stupider and stupider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why don't I just keep running.</v>

1880
01:17:28.731 --> 01:17:30.950
<v Speaker 3>This thing is so slow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why he duking it out with it.</v>

1881
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:31.843
<v Speaker 3>It will never catch you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you would literally never catch </v>

1882
01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:35.930
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you could run for a couple hours and</v>

1883
01:17:35.931 --> 01:17:36.764
<v Speaker 3>then take a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this stupid fucking green man will </v>

1884
01:17:38.871 --> 01:17:41.450
<v Speaker 3>be coming over the top of that hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd hear his footsteps.</v>

1885
01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:44.810
<v Speaker 3>He probably makes a lot of noise when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>walks and he would wake up and then just</v>

1886
01:17:44.811 --> 01:17:47.300
<v Speaker 3>runs more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never fought nothing like that.</v>

1887
01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:53.210
<v Speaker 3>You know whAt I'm saying though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I follow you dog.</v>

1888
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:55.430
<v Speaker 3>One time this guy fight in me when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they made us hug in the hallway.</v>

1893
01:18:03.381 --> 01:18:05.820
<v Speaker 3>That was the big thing at our and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>over at our school.</v>

1894
01:18:05.821 --> 01:18:06.654
<v Speaker 3>We had to stand there all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all afternoon for literally probably </v>

1895
01:18:08.511 --> 01:18:09.344
<v Speaker 3>maybe two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three hours with your arms on each </v>

1896
01:18:10.581 --> 01:18:12.490
<v Speaker 3>other's shoulders after you fought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1897
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:13.783
<v Speaker 3>To make it up with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he became one of my best friends </v>

1898
01:18:14.961 --> 01:18:16.040
<v Speaker 3>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>So his brother,</v>

1902
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:23.660
<v Speaker 3>I guess made out on our behalf.</v>

1903
01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.410
<v Speaker 3>So you guys fought over,</v>

1908
01:18:34.761 --> 01:18:36.380
<v Speaker 3>whenever you ran your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1909

<v Speaker 2>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just go and buy one of those </v>

2018
01:23:21.851 --> 01:23:22.684
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it scary driving a car that it costs </v>

<v Speaker 2>a lot of money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it like nerve wracking?</v>

01:23:25.781 --> 01:23:27.460
<v Speaker 2>A little bit for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2021
01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:28.653
<v Speaker 2>But it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all depends on how much money you </v>

2022
01:23:29.531 --> 01:23:30.360
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2023
01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for chris brown driving that car,</v>

2024
01:23:32.501 --> 01:23:34.510
<v Speaker 2>he's probably could afford 30 or 40 of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2025
01:23:34.570 --> 01:23:35.141
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

2026
01:23:35.141 --> 01:23:36.950
<v Speaker 2>So for him it's probably not that scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2027
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:40.120
<v Speaker 2>And plus there's something about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

2028
01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:42.160
<v Speaker 2>the rapper world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not really a rapper,</v>

2029
01:23:42.161 --> 01:23:43.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you call him a rapper?</v>

2030
01:23:43.241 --> 01:23:45.490
<v Speaker 2>He's like a singer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could've been like michael,</v>

2031
01:23:45.491 --> 01:23:46.870
<v Speaker 2>janet painter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could have been,</v>

2032
01:23:46.871 --> 01:23:47.704
<v Speaker 2>just call him an entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something in that world where </v>

2033
01:23:49.931 --> 01:23:50.764
<v Speaker 2>it's very valuable to be flossy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very valuable to have like floyd </v>

2034
01:23:55.391 --> 01:23:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Mayweather type watches and gold chains.</v>

2035
01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:00.430
<v Speaker 2>And like if you're a singer or a rapper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2036
01:24:00.431 --> 01:24:03.700

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2037
01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:06.100
<v Speaker 2>like chris brown represents the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulls up in a ferrari.</v>

2038
01:24:06.101 --> 01:24:06.391
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2078
01:25:35.770 --> 01:25:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I lost $2,000 in a pyramid scheme</v>

2079
01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:39.634
<v Speaker 2>when I was younger because I grew up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>an area where there's a lot of pyramid </v>

2080
01:25:41.681 --> 01:25:43.360
<v Speaker 2>schemes coming through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How they get ya.</v>

2081
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just asked me for $2,000,</v>

2082
01:25:45.791 --> 01:25:48.280
<v Speaker 2>pretty much dead and I gave it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what did they say?</v>

2083
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Did they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2084
01:25:49.481 --> 01:25:51.340
<v Speaker 2>they showed you this specialized sheet </v>
<v Speaker 2>of paper.</v>

2085
01:25:51.341 --> 01:25:53.470
<v Speaker 2>That's what they really called it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even specialized chart,</v>

2086
01:25:54.970 --> 01:25:55.803
<v Speaker 2>which in hindsight is the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the lamest name for like a </v>

2087
01:25:59.771 --> 01:26:01.360
<v Speaker 2>pyramid scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a specialized chart,</v>

2088
01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:02.213
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2089
01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:03.243
<v Speaker 2>And then they had these different blocks</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the bottom row is green and then </v>

2090
01:26:05.181 --> 01:26:07.790
<v Speaker 2>yellow and then red,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue and then red.</v>

2091
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:08.803
<v Speaker 2>And each time you put 2000 and you got </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else to put your money in and </v>

2092
01:26:11.511 --> 01:26:12.344
<v Speaker 2>then you sold your and you kept moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and it literally was a pyramid and </v>

2093
01:26:16.041 --> 01:26:19.700
<v Speaker 2>you'd heard like the term pyramid scheme</v>
<v Speaker 2>and was still fell for it,</v>

2094
01:26:19.701 --> 01:26:21.080
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in hindsight,</v>

2095
01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:22.143
<v Speaker 2>I still miss that money a lot of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had an old boxing coach tried to hit </v>

2096
01:26:24.951 --> 01:26:26.210
<v Speaker 2>me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those really?</v>

2097
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I first moved to la,</v>

2098
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:31.180
<v Speaker 2>I was working out at this place in north</v>
<v Speaker 2>hollywood and I was uh,</v>

2099
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:34.420
<v Speaker 2>taking boxing lessons from this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2100
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:35.263
<v Speaker 2>one day he came up with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the clunkiest shittiest pyramid </v>

2101
01:26:38.901 --> 01:26:43.100
<v Speaker 2>scheme pitch ever because he wasn't like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good talker in the first place,</v>

2102
01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:44.120
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2103
01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:44.811
<v Speaker 2>And he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2104
01:26:44.811 --> 01:26:46.520
<v Speaker 2>here's this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on a sitcom.</v>

2105
01:26:46.521 --> 01:26:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Nobody was watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knew who I was back then.</v>

2106
01:26:48.831 --> 01:26:49.664
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like he targeted me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was Just a dude with the gym that he </v>

2107
01:26:51.171 --> 01:26:52.610
<v Speaker 2>thought it was an actor might have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

2108
01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2109
01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:54.860
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

2110
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:57.860
<v Speaker 2>I bought these rims on my truck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got them from that,</v>

2111
01:26:58.660 --> 01:26:59.493
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

2112
01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.770
<v Speaker 2>how's it work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2113
01:27:00.771 --> 01:27:01.604
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put in money and then after awhile </v>

2114
01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:04.850
<v Speaker 2>you know you could take some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money out and you can get a lot of money</v>

2115
01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:05.840
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2116
01:27:05.841 --> 01:27:08.470
<v Speaker 2>what is this a pyramid scheme?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just looked at me,</v>

2117
01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.980
<v Speaker 2>his eyes glazed over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2118
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:11.450
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was levels.</v>

2119
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:12.480
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put on this go.</v>

2120
01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:16.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a pyramid scheme and we just stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>there in the parking lot looking at each</v>

2121
01:27:16.281 --> 01:27:18.130
<v Speaker 2>other and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta go,</v>

2122
01:27:18.230 --> 01:27:21.020
<v Speaker 2>and so I leave and then I never wear </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked out at that gym again.</v>

2123
01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:21.441
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2124
01:27:21.441 --> 01:27:22.274
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't come here anymore and Just </v>

2125
01:27:23.641 --> 01:27:26.630
<v Speaker 2>fucking guy's trying to get my money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus he's a big dude.</v>

2126
01:27:26.631 --> 01:27:29.570
<v Speaker 2>So it was kind of dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous to say no dude.</v>

2127
01:27:29.571 --> 01:27:31.430
<v Speaker 2>I used to work out with David Duke when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was growing up.</v>

2128
01:27:31.431 --> 01:27:32.264
<v Speaker 2>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shared the back fence when I was </v>

2129
01:27:33.771 --> 01:27:35.900
<v Speaker 2>growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy shit.</v>

2130
01:27:36.650 --> 01:27:38.240
<v Speaker 2>We used to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2131
01:27:38.241 --> 01:27:39.074
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you consider the klu </v>

2132
01:27:40.311 --> 01:27:43.290
<v Speaker 2>klux klan a pyramid scheme or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

2133
01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:44.390
<v Speaker 2>and he dated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2134
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:45.223
<v Speaker 2>I've worked at the seafood restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a Bus boy over there and he dated </v>

2135
01:27:48.201 --> 01:27:50.780
<v Speaker 2>the prettiest girl that worked at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>seafood restaurant.</v>

2136
01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Was this when he was in the kkk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2137
01:27:52.701 --> 01:27:56.000
<v Speaker 2>this was after his nonpracticing </v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly seemed like a nice guy to.</v>

2138
01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:56.893
<v Speaker 2>How many years ago was.</v>

2139
01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:00.313
<v Speaker 2>This was 1995.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was when he was in the public </v>

2140
01:28:03.071 --> 01:28:04.790
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like a big deal back then,</v>

2141
01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't that one,</v>

2142
01:28:06.450 --> 01:28:07.283
<v Speaker 2>was it later than that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That he was like running for public </v>

2143
01:28:09.501 --> 01:28:11.450
<v Speaker 2>office?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me think.</v>

2144
01:28:11.451 --> 01:28:14.840
<v Speaker 2>It was when I was younger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was running against edwin edwards,</v>

2145
01:28:14.841 --> 01:28:15.960
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for public office.</v>

2146
01:28:15.961 --> 01:28:20.150
<v Speaker 2>That was probably around 1990 or 88.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he did some stuff after that</v>

2147
01:28:20.151 --> 01:28:23.180
<v Speaker 2>though on a national level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't on a state level.</v>

2148
01:28:23.181 --> 01:28:25.010
<v Speaker 2>What is he running for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Governor or something like that.</v>

2149
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:27.680
<v Speaker 2>He ran for governor a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2150
01:28:27.681 --> 01:28:30.080
<v Speaker 2>him and I remember the signs because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't.</v>

2151
01:28:30.081 --> 01:28:32.460
<v Speaker 2>Edwards was a crook allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2152
01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:37.100
<v Speaker 2>David Duke was a racist and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>that one of the campaign poster said,</v>

2153
01:28:37.101 --> 01:28:39.380
<v Speaker 2>don't vote for the racist vote for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crook.</v>

2154
01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:42.470
<v Speaker 2>That was the campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's everywhere.</v>

2155
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:43.250
<v Speaker 2>She's crying.</v>

2156
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:44.220
<v Speaker 2>And a crook one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that man,</v>

2157
01:28:44.230 --> 01:28:47.370
<v Speaker 2>one that's quite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to go to,</v>

2158
01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:49.460
<v Speaker 2>and I'll tell you this man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

2159
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:51.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a believer,</v>

2160
01:28:51.041 --> 01:28:52.550
<v Speaker 2>this is practices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was a.</v>

2161
01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:56.180
<v Speaker 2>He was elected to Louisiana house of </v>
<v Speaker 2>representatives in 1989.</v>

2162
01:28:56.181 --> 01:29:00.350
<v Speaker 2>And that year the sitting representative</v>
<v Speaker 2>resigned his seat to become a judge.</v>

2163
01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:04.110
<v Speaker 2>And duke ran in the special election to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fill a seat.</v>

2164
01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:08.520
<v Speaker 2>Daily beast describes the race in </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing the off year,</v>

2165
01:29:08.521 --> 01:29:11.820

<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He issued overtly racist language and </v>

2171
01:29:28.951 --> 01:29:29.784

<v Speaker 2>criticizing affirmative action and </v>

01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:06.330
<v Speaker 2>You don't do that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't bleed like that.</v>

2404
01:39:06.331 --> 01:39:08.640
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be a huge drag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If women just bled.</v>

2405
01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:09.713
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you are purposely just dripped </v>

2406
01:39:10.491 --> 01:39:11.324
<v Speaker 2>dropping her in my living room and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that I love this carpet and you </v>

2407
01:39:14.161 --> 01:39:16.590
<v Speaker 2>know that I probably can't afford new </v>
<v Speaker 2>carpet.</v>

2408
01:39:17.010 --> 01:39:17.843
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this thing where these women </v>

2409
01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:22.230
<v Speaker 2>were letting their periods run down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs,</v>

2410
01:39:22.670 --> 01:39:25.620
<v Speaker 2>like in some sort of a protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the protest was about,</v>

2411
01:39:26.190 --> 01:39:27.023
<v Speaker 2>but I remember watching that going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have absolutely failed as a human </v>

2412
01:39:31.501 --> 01:39:32.334
<v Speaker 2>being if we're so in denial of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological process that it's somehow or </v>

2413
01:39:37.231 --> 01:39:42.231
<v Speaker 2>another a protest to let your menstrual </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood rolled down your legs somewhere.</v>

2414
01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:47.370
<v Speaker 2>There's been some serious errors in </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>

2415
01:39:47.371 --> 01:39:48.204
<v Speaker 2>If that's a statement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were making a statement by </v>

2416
01:39:49.981 --> 01:39:50.814
<v Speaker 2>letting period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's either a massive failure in </v>

2417
01:39:53.401 --> 01:39:57.600
<v Speaker 2>the sight of men to not communicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2418
01:39:57.601 --> 01:40:00.060
<v Speaker 2>It's no big deaL.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a natural cycle of life.</v>

2419
01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.890
<v Speaker 2>It's a part of life doesn't freak us </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2420
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.903
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't freak you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's figure out how you can get </v>

2421
01:40:04.530 --> 01:40:05.363
<v Speaker 2>tampons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's make sure you get take care of </v>

2422
01:40:06.391 --> 01:40:07.224
<v Speaker 2>just like the same way we make sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have toilet paper in the </v>

2423
01:40:08.821 --> 01:40:09.700
<v Speaker 2>bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2424
01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:12.750
<v Speaker 2>You don't just go shitting your pants </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the of protest,</v>

2425
01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:13.613
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

2426
01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:16.740
<v Speaker 2>It's a Hygiene issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it shouldn't be a pro,</v>

2427
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:17.663
<v Speaker 2>a good gender based protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how bad is our lines of </v>

2428
01:40:21.571 --> 01:40:22.404
<v Speaker 2>communication?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to get where women in any way </v>

2429
01:40:24.541 --> 01:40:25.374
<v Speaker 2>think that letting your pussy bleed down</v>
<v Speaker 2>your leg is reclaiming some sort of </v>

2430
01:40:29.761 --> 01:40:31.200
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

2431
01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's tacky.</v>

2432
01:40:35.490 --> 01:40:36.031
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2433
01:40:36.031 --> 01:40:36.864
<v Speaker 2>I don't and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly don't know a woman that will </v>

2434
01:40:38.201 --> 01:40:39.450
<v Speaker 2>do it or really want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2435
01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:41.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to even happens by </v>
<v Speaker 2>accident.</v>

2436
01:40:41.851 --> 01:40:43.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't freak me out.</v>

2437
01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:45.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't get freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freaked out by it.</v>

2438
01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Some people do though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2439
01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get freaked out by,</v>

2440
01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:49.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a period or somebody,</v>

2441
01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:52.700
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know.</v>

2442
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:53.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gone wrong with the communication where </v>

2443
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:56.470
<v Speaker 2>that becomes a protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2444
01:40:56.471 --> 01:40:58.030
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>

2445
01:40:58.390 --> 01:41:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's wrong of me to say.</v>

2446
01:41:00.191 --> 01:41:02.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what the protest is about.</v>

2447
01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it on both sides,</v>

2448
01:41:05.231 --> 01:41:06.064
<v Speaker 2>but it seems so unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the reason they were doing </v>

2449
01:41:08.051 --> 01:41:10.000
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2450
01:41:10.630 --> 01:41:11.950
<v Speaker 2>it was really recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2451
01:41:11.951 --> 01:41:13.810
<v Speaker 2>why aren't men protesting more about </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

2452
01:41:13.811 --> 01:41:14.230
<v Speaker 2>do you think?</v>

2453
01:41:14.230 --> 01:41:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Have you noticed that there's not as </v>
<v Speaker 2>many tests.</v>

2454
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:19.960
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to get sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tampon tax.</v>

2455
01:41:20.290 --> 01:41:21.890
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2456
01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:24.890
<v Speaker 2>How long ago was this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty reasonably 15.</v>

2457
01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:26.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2458
01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:29.140
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm thinking like more recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>events.</v>

2459
01:41:29.190 --> 01:41:34.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like a drip in events where women </v>
<v Speaker 2>protest by letting their menstrual blood</v>

2460
01:41:34.361 --> 01:41:35.194
<v Speaker 2>running down their legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>school that place and prepare for some </v>

2461
01:41:37.031 --> 01:41:37.864
<v Speaker 2>inquiries from the fbi to see some </v>
<v Speaker 2>footage you probably don't want to say </v>

2462
01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:43.070
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to come to your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2463
01:41:43.090 --> 01:41:43.691
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2464
01:41:43.691 --> 01:41:47.140
<v Speaker 2>I remember protesting in college about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the soccer coach.</v>

2465
01:41:47.150 --> 01:41:51.370
<v Speaker 2>Had the girls' soccer team on Korea team</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I remember protesting about that.</v>

2466
01:41:51.371 --> 01:41:52.204
<v Speaker 2>You protested?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2468
01:41:54.791 --> 01:41:56.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the last minute,</v>

2469

<v Speaker 2>the coaches are out there and meet the </v>
<v Speaker 2>local news is out there like </v>

<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2472
01:42:02.890 --> 01:42:04.720

2474
01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.410
<v Speaker 2>he had that carl sagan disease or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>

2475
01:42:08.411 --> 01:42:09.161
<v Speaker 2>Who's that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

2476
01:42:09.161 --> 01:42:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Even the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stephen hawking.</v>

2477
01:42:11.050 --> 01:42:12.550
<v Speaker 2>He showed up in that van,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2478
01:42:12.551 --> 01:42:14.200

<v Speaker 2>got rain forest.</v>

2480
01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:18.970
<v Speaker 2>And then the little ramp came down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he came rolling out with a picket sign.</v>

2481
01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:20.470
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he died.</v>

2482
01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:21.670
<v Speaker 2>He actually died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died,</v>

2483
01:42:21.671 --> 01:42:23.380

<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2485

2486
01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

2487
01:42:30.210 --> 01:42:31.420

<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2488
01:42:31.421 --> 01:42:32.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2489
01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:34.780
<v Speaker 2>Medication gets denied of people when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they die.</v>

2490
01:42:34.781 --> 01:42:38.080
<v Speaker 2>They become a casualty of the disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

2491
01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:38.973
<v Speaker 2>So why wAs he given the girls creatine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's dangerous about giving girls </v>

2492
01:42:41.141 --> 01:42:41.974
<v Speaker 2>creatures that come out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we just did it like people didn't </v>

2493
01:42:43.601 --> 01:42:44.434
<v Speaker 2>know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the member of the first time </v>

2494
01:42:45.311 --> 01:42:46.300
<v Speaker 2>creating hit the market.</v>

2495
01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:47.590
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2496
01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.270
<v Speaker 2>it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you definitely work.</v>

2497
01:42:49.271 --> 01:42:50.890
<v Speaker 2>But it made you gain a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

2498
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:53.680
<v Speaker 2>Waterways get a little little chubby in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the face.</v>

2499
01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:55.060
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does the,</v>

2500
01:42:55.061 --> 01:42:56.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative ass is?</v>

2501
01:42:56.291 --> 01:43:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Was there a negative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The coaches just take it and they didn't</v>

2502
01:43:00.011 --> 01:43:01.270
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

2503
01:43:01.271 --> 01:43:02.104
<v Speaker 2>So the coaches didn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just wanted some sort of an edge </v>

2504
01:43:04.031 --> 01:43:05.620
<v Speaker 2>and hadn't been established whether it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was safe yet.</v>

2505
01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2506
01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:08.080
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just kind of like,</v>

2507
01:43:08.081 --> 01:43:10.110
<v Speaker 2>we got antsy and got out there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>started protesting.</v>

2508
01:43:10.630 --> 01:43:11.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of protests going on </v>

2509
01:43:12.221 --> 01:43:14.020
<v Speaker 2>except.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when there is a protest,</v>

2510
01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:17.620
<v Speaker 2>it's almost always liberal people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are protesting these days,</v>

2511
01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:18.713
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be like protesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some speaker at some university </v>

2512
01:43:21.971 --> 01:43:22.600
<v Speaker 2>tHey'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2513
01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:26.110
<v Speaker 2>have some speaker and they'll be </v>
<v Speaker 2>protesting them or you know,</v>

2514
01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:29.180
<v Speaker 2>it'll be like the women's march as being</v>
<v Speaker 2>as protest.</v>

2515
01:43:29.210 --> 01:43:30.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these protests against trump left </v>

2516
01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:33.903
<v Speaker 2>wing marches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say that the tea party had some </v>

2517
01:43:36.131 --> 01:43:36.964
<v Speaker 2>massive protest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't find anything that shows </v>

2518
01:43:38.930 --> 01:43:41.950
<v Speaker 2>there's been any numbers that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything close to that women's march,</v>

2519
01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:44.830
<v Speaker 2>especially in la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that said there was speculated</v>

2520
01:43:44.831 --> 01:43:48.280
<v Speaker 2>numbers that weren't proven upwards of </v>
<v Speaker 2>one to 2 million people.</v>

2521
01:43:49.730 --> 01:43:50.563
<v Speaker 2>One or two places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they had any people back then </v>

2522
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.420
<v Speaker 2>because I heard that crowd or go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2523
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:58.880
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is Like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about that,</v>

2524
01:43:58.881 --> 01:44:02.810
<v Speaker 2>like you got to think of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>confirmed confirmed numbers.</v>

2525
01:44:02.811 --> 01:44:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Like we have satellite images now that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2526
01:44:04.850 --> 01:44:07.250
<v Speaker 2>that are different than what they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>back then.</v>

2527
01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.230
<v Speaker 2>So like if you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2528
01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:11.930
<v Speaker 2>like the footage that they were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about with the inauguration,</v>

2529
01:44:12.170 --> 01:44:13.003
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty clear when you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>full 24 hours sped up footage of how </v>

2530
01:44:17.691 --> 01:44:20.510
<v Speaker 2>many people were in the crowd versus how</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people in the crowd.</v>

2531
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:22.460
<v Speaker 2>For a mama there was more people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For oBama,</v>

2532
01:44:22.461 --> 01:44:24.890
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a massive amount of people</v>

2533
01:44:24.891 --> 01:44:27.530
<v Speaker 2>when you look at it on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but overall,</v>

2534
01:44:28.210 --> 01:44:30.110
<v Speaker 2>and you look at the big picture from </v>
<v Speaker 2>above,</v>

2535
01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:31.093
<v Speaker 2>it's not as many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So knowing that they tried to conflate </v>

2536
01:44:34.221 --> 01:44:35.054
<v Speaker 2>those numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they try to inflate those numbers and </v>

2537
01:44:37.131 --> 01:44:37.964
<v Speaker 2>make it seem like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean with a lot of people were saying </v>

2538
01:44:39.921 --> 01:44:40.754
<v Speaker 2>it and they even said it on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the biggest crowd for </v>

2539
01:44:42.381 --> 01:44:43.750
<v Speaker 2>inauguration ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know.</v>

2540
01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:44.593
<v Speaker 2>Now we know now that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe that was the same thing with </v>

2541
01:44:46.971 --> 01:44:48.290
<v Speaker 2>the tea party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really don't know.</v>

2542
01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:50.810
<v Speaker 2>It's tough to tell unless it happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>

2543
01:44:50.990 --> 01:44:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Like if they had it tomorrow and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could use the same modern methods of,</v>

2544
01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:57.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out how many people in an area.</v>

2545
01:44:57.740 --> 01:45:01.820
<v Speaker 2>But they said that they think there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>970,000 people at the women's march,</v>

2546
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:03.400
<v Speaker 2>just in los angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2547
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:04.730
<v Speaker 2>I heard that'S the biggest thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever happened.</v>

2548
01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:05.773
<v Speaker 2>And it was all over the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were in pretty much every </v>

2549
01:45:08.211 --> 01:45:09.021
<v Speaker 2>big city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2550
01:45:09.021 --> 01:45:10.580
<v Speaker 2>Didn't they have a bunch of them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2551
01:45:10.581 --> 01:45:11.414
<v Speaker 2>You think it was a lot of dudes who were</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hoping that like there was an </v>

2552
01:45:12.861 --> 01:45:14.900
<v Speaker 2>attack or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they lose their wife or something,</v>

2553
01:45:14.901 --> 01:45:15.734
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2554
01:45:18.010 --> 01:45:20.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about a lot of dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it probably at least one guy.</v>

2555
01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more than one.</v>

2556
01:45:21.921 --> 01:45:22.391

<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2560
01:45:27.610 --> 01:45:32.560

<v Speaker 2>was going to get them to be it,</v>

2561
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:34.700
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

2562
01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I never been involved in any terrorism.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2564
01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:41.193
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was some stuff going around the </v>

2565
01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:43.153
<v Speaker 4>end of last year with mike pence and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>house bill about an abortion bill in </v>

2566
01:45:47.501 --> 01:45:48.334
<v Speaker 4>Indiana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is bringing up some more stuff </v>

2567
01:45:49.841 --> 01:45:52.300
<v Speaker 4>about the taxes on tampons all over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

2568
01:45:52.530 --> 01:45:53.363
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so these girls were letting their </v>

2569
01:45:54.961 --> 01:45:57.650
<v Speaker 2>menstrual cycles run down their legs </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the other satellite.</v>

2570
01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:00.150
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with saying I don't like that.</v>

2571
01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:02.760
<v Speaker 2>It makes me feel uncomfortable and I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel that way.</v>

2572
01:46:02.761 --> 01:46:04.380
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I can't even say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2573
01:46:04.381 --> 01:46:05.214
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm on the girls side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck are you raising taxes on </v>

2574
01:46:07.441 --> 01:46:08.550
<v Speaker 2>tampons?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2575
01:46:08.630 --> 01:46:11.310
<v Speaker 2>but you want to make more money off </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that people have to buy.</v>

2576
01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:12.480
<v Speaker 2>that's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2577
01:46:12.481 --> 01:46:13.314
<v Speaker 2>that is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up because you have to buy </v>

2578
01:46:14.821 --> 01:46:15.654
<v Speaker 2>tampons and men don't have to buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if men decide make them pay for the </v>

2579
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:19.590
<v Speaker 2>fucking tampons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's a tax.</v>

2580
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:21.360
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just lazy and dumb.</v>

2581
01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:22.373
<v Speaker 2>Trying to figure out where to shove </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes and don't make any sense like </v>

2582
01:46:24.090 --> 01:46:25.550
<v Speaker 2>tampons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What or how,</v>

2583
01:46:25.570 --> 01:46:27.990
<v Speaker 2>but what else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Net tAx vitamins you piece of shit.</v>

2584
01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:30.870
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to tax healthy food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking assholes.</v>

2585
01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Why would it like seeing just something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little craft here?</v>

2586
01:46:32.671 --> 01:46:35.940
<v Speaker 2>I feel like maybe take tampons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them on the end of a arrow,</v>

2587
01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:37.590
<v Speaker 2>firearm into the capital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2588
01:46:37.591 --> 01:46:39.750
<v Speaker 2>like something that really know what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

2589
01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:41.850
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's dangerous.</v>

2590
01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:42.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I just wondered if you died </v>

2591
01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:46.410
<v Speaker 2>because you got hit with an arrow that </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a tampon in the end of it.</v>

2592
01:46:46.830 --> 01:46:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Right through your eyeball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right into your brain.</v>

2593
01:46:48.841 --> 01:46:51.750
<v Speaker 2>You dead and it's sticking out of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head like a planted tree.</v>

2594
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:55.720
<v Speaker 2>But at least the blood flow stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2595
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:57.103
<v Speaker 2>At least you know what women go through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this group online for a while </v>

2596
01:46:59.641 --> 01:47:00.474
<v Speaker 2>where you could put a tampon in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>butt to get know what women go through </v>

2597
01:47:02.611 --> 01:47:03.444
<v Speaker 2>hollow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had to put a tampon in your blood </v>

2598
01:47:04.261 --> 01:47:05.880
<v Speaker 2>for like three or four days to kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

2602
01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:13.133
<v Speaker 2>they had this group online about six or </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven years ago where you put a tampon </v>

2603
01:47:15.541 --> 01:47:16.374
<v Speaker 2>in your buttocks to a experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So man can experience what it's like to </v>

<v Speaker 2>have at least something in his body all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time like that.</v>

2630
01:48:15.391 --> 01:48:16.224
<v Speaker 2>an issue back when rush limbaugh got in </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble for saying some girl's a slut </v>

2631
01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:22.890
<v Speaker 2>because she wanted birth control pills </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be paid for by insurance.</v>

2632
01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:25.140
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people got real mad at him.</v>

2633
01:48:25.290 --> 01:48:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just sounds like something he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say.</v>

2634
01:48:27.090 --> 01:48:27.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a big issue because I think some </v>

2635
01:48:30.301 --> 01:48:31.134
<v Speaker 2>women for their own health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually need birth control pills </v>

2636
01:48:34.681 --> 01:48:38.700
<v Speaker 2>and not just for a sex women that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even have sex.</v>

2637
01:48:38.701 --> 01:48:42.000
<v Speaker 2>Like it regulates certain diseases and </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues that they might have.</v>

2638
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:45.600
<v Speaker 2>So there's apparently more than one </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason to take that stuff.</v>

2639
01:48:45.601 --> 01:48:46.434
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2640
01:48:46.690 --> 01:48:48.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think they should,</v>

2641
01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:48.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should be able to choose what they </v>

2642
01:48:50.011 --> 01:48:50.761
<v Speaker 2>need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2643
01:48:50.761 --> 01:48:54.450
<v Speaker 2>like which just crazy to tax it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the extra taxes and bonds,</v>

2644
01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:58.570
<v Speaker 2>finding some money some other way or </v>
<v Speaker 2>even just ask dude's ass.</v>

2645
01:48:58.570 --> 01:48:59.670
<v Speaker 2>People say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2646
01:48:59.730 --> 01:49:01.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are having a tough time or we need</v>

2647
01:49:01.711 --> 01:49:03.120
<v Speaker 2>extra money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dudes are going to go,</v>

2648
01:49:03.121 --> 01:49:03.954
<v Speaker 2>fuck you think I throw a couple extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars out there for a lady that needs </v>

2649
01:49:06.811 --> 01:49:07.750
<v Speaker 2>a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2650
01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:08.990
<v Speaker 2>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2651
01:49:09.090 --> 01:49:12.410
<v Speaker 2>You goT a good heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

2652
01:49:13.110 --> 01:49:14.280
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do that day.</v>

2653
01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2654
01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:17.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2655
01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:18.720
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a necessity.</v>

2656
01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like whether tampons or maxi pads,</v>

2657
01:49:21.130 --> 01:49:21.963
<v Speaker 2>it's some sort of a necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just lucky we don't have that </v>

2658
01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:25.500
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if that was an issue for men,</v>

2659
01:49:25.501 --> 01:49:29.670
<v Speaker 2>like if men bled out of our ball sack </v>
<v Speaker 2>for ball sack leaked once a month.</v>

2660
01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:31.013
<v Speaker 2>If that was the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how pissed would be if they started </v>

2661
01:49:34.201 --> 01:49:36.990
<v Speaker 2>making tampons and you got a tax </v>
<v Speaker 2>tampons,</v>

2662
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:39.870
<v Speaker 2>you'll make more money off me in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls.</v>

01:49:42.290 --> 01:49:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd be fucking furious.</v>

2666
01:49:44.250 --> 01:49:45.320
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well dude,</v>

2667
01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:46.650
<v Speaker 2>if we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we had that,</v>

2668
01:49:46.651 --> 01:49:48.490
<v Speaker 2>we would not handle it well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did I be scared?</v>

2669
01:49:48.491 --> 01:49:49.324
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably stay indoors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather you get nervous a lot and we </v>

2670
01:49:52.421 --> 01:49:53.254
<v Speaker 2>would definitely want birth control to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be paid for by the government in a </v>

2671
01:49:55.391 --> 01:49:57.280
<v Speaker 2>heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on with that.</v>

2672
01:49:57.770 --> 01:49:58.301
<v Speaker 2>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2673
01:49:58.301 --> 01:49:59.134

<v Speaker 2>when you really put on yourself and see </v>

<v Speaker 2>Really cool guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>dude got away with it.</v>

2698
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:55.960

<v Speaker 2>like it was just legal,</v>

<v Speaker 2>high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was only 25.</v>

2706
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:13.383
<v Speaker 2>He was 25 and she was 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he thought he was a 150,000 years </v>

2707

<v Speaker 2>Here's why.</v>

2715
01:51:39.071 --> 01:51:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Because when I was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I turned 18.</v>

2717
01:51:44.621 --> 01:51:48.340
<v Speaker 2>when I turned 18 she turned 17 first.</v>

2718

<v Speaker 2>white girl.</v>

2721
01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:58.233
<v Speaker 2>Her mother was worried that what we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing was illegal because she knew that </v>

<v Speaker 2>Like is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a year?</v>

2744
01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Because one day your legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if she's 17 years in 364 days,</v>

2745
01:52:56.570 --> 01:52:58.760
<v Speaker 2>she's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next day she's legal.</v>

2746
01:52:58.761 --> 01:53:00.650
<v Speaker 2>So you're telling me is some magic </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2747
01:53:00.651 --> 01:53:04.160
<v Speaker 2>Takes place over 24 hour period where </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden she's illegal.</v>

2748
01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:05.353
<v Speaker 2>That seems odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're just 18 or 19 or </v>

2749
01:53:08.331 --> 01:53:11.720
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets super weird if you're 70 right?</v>

2750
01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:12.613
<v Speaker 2>You know you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're super old and you're sitting </v>

2751
01:53:13.941 --> 01:53:14.774
<v Speaker 2>there outside of the school going one </v>
<v Speaker 2>more day waiting one motherfucking </v>

2752
01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:19.373
<v Speaker 2>rubbing your hands together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll go to wendy's after I got candy </v>

2753
01:53:23.181 --> 01:53:24.830
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2754
01:53:25.190 --> 01:53:26.023
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just like a hard law like that as to </v>

2755
01:53:29.721 --> 01:53:32.420
<v Speaker 2>when consent occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it was,</v>

2756
01:53:32.490 --> 01:53:35.210
<v Speaker 2>when the age of consent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's 18 or 17,</v>

2757
01:53:35.211 --> 01:53:39.140
<v Speaker 2>and in some places it would be 16 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some places you can marry people at 13.</v>

2758
01:53:39.141 --> 01:53:39.974
<v Speaker 2>It gOt real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe that like a 16 year old </v>

2759
01:53:42.351 --> 01:53:44.870
<v Speaker 2>and a 30 year old could fall in love?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe that?</v>

2760
01:53:46.730 --> 01:53:48.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't not believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2761
01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.780
<v Speaker 2>Because weird people are fucking weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2762
01:53:51.060 --> 01:53:54.710
<v Speaker 2>People are weird and sometimes people </v>
<v Speaker 2>get together and it defies all odds,</v>

2763
01:53:54.711 --> 01:53:56.360
<v Speaker 2>but it works great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2764
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Like there are people that have bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships where they're,</v>

2765
01:53:59.691 --> 01:54:02.300
<v Speaker 2>they're separated by vast distances in </v>
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>

2766
01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Their personalities are different </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

2767
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:07.280
<v Speaker 2>whenever you go eight years.</v>

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.940
<v Speaker 2>It was a hot 30 year old woman and a 16 </v>
<v Speaker 2>year old boy.</v>

2787
01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:52.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's ideal for the kid,</v>

2788
01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:56.050
<v Speaker 2>but what if he's 18?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he's 18 and she's 30?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2795
01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:12.730
<v Speaker 2>One of the islands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she went to jail for a while,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's eight shows.</v>

2805
01:55:35.141 --> 01:55:35.974
<v Speaker 4>The video says it's an 80 year old man </v>
<v Speaker 4>meeting his 12 year old bride for the </v>

2806

<v Speaker 4>This</v>

2809
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.020
<v Speaker 2>is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like meeting her and she looks like</v>

2810
01:55:46.021 --> 01:55:48.990
<v Speaker 2>she wants to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She looks super sad.</v>

2811

<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2817
01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:00.900
<v Speaker 2>that's pronounced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marriages are terrifying.</v>

2818
01:56:01.290 --> 01:56:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's got to stop.</v>

01:56:02.251 --> 01:56:03.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2820
01:56:03.810 --> 01:56:06.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't live there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like going on from the beginning of</v>

2821
01:56:06.991 --> 01:56:07.824
<v Speaker 2>time because people have been oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now it's the first time you can </v>

2822
01:56:09.301 --> 01:56:10.134
<v Speaker 2>broadcast to the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they look at it through their </v>

2823
01:56:11.761 --> 01:56:14.520
<v Speaker 2>standards versus the standards of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that live in that area.</v>

2824
01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:15.600
<v Speaker 2>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think thAt's fair,</v>

2825
01:56:15.601 --> 01:56:16.730
<v Speaker 2>that safe idea or no?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2826
01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:18.920
<v Speaker 2>it's 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not care or safe and scary.</v>

2827
01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:20.430
<v Speaker 2>It's ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Antiquated.</v>

2828
01:56:20.730 --> 01:56:21.563
<v Speaker 2>He comes from liKe these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these cultures that have not caught up </v>

2829
01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:27.420
<v Speaker 2>to our own current perception of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2830
01:56:27.510 --> 01:56:28.830
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of civilization,</v>

2831
01:56:28.831 --> 01:56:30.010
<v Speaker 2>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2832
01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:31.850
<v Speaker 2>that you should let people do what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck they want to do.</v>

2833
01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:33.240
<v Speaker 2>There's no way that kid wants to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2834
01:56:33.690 --> 01:56:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you think at some point we start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2835
01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:39.030
<v Speaker 2>like at what point is technology like </v>
<v Speaker 2>not good for us anymore?</v>

2836
01:56:39.031 --> 01:56:42.450
<v Speaker 2>This has been on my mind a lot recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just make me think about that.</v>

2837
01:56:42.451 --> 01:56:43.284
<v Speaker 2>like at what point is it that if we want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to survive as humans still like at what </v>

2838
01:56:48.211 --> 01:56:53.211
<v Speaker 2>point do we stop it or not stop it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do we do?</v>

2839
01:56:54.930 --> 01:56:55.763
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know because I feel like it's taken </v>

2840
01:56:56.251 --> 01:56:59.100
<v Speaker 2>over so quickly that we're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be human.</v>

2841
01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:01.110
<v Speaker 2>We're behaving very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we'll still be human.</v>

2842
01:57:01.110 --> 01:57:04.020
<v Speaker 2>What are behaviors are going to be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

2843
01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:08.370
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to be running little </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems were operators.</v>

2844
01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2845
01:57:09.601 --> 01:57:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're feeling and thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what a lot of people feeling.</v>

2846
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Think it's a pretty common subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are talking about.</v>

2847
01:57:16.531 --> 01:57:17.364
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have perceptions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and fears and projections of what </v>

2848
01:57:20.911 --> 01:57:22.830
<v Speaker 2>they think are going to happen and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one really knows.</v>

2849
01:57:23.370 --> 01:57:24.203
<v Speaker 2>No one reAlly knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for sure the way we live right now </v>

2850
01:57:27.570 --> 01:57:28.403
<v Speaker 2>is super alien to the way the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that lived when your dad was born and </v>

2851
01:57:32.821 --> 01:57:34.110
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2852
01:57:34.230 --> 01:57:36.180
<v Speaker 2>a generation ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really,</v>

2853
01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:37.253
<v Speaker 2>if you really look at what it really is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like your dad like one skip one go to </v>

2854
01:57:40.531 --> 01:57:42.030
<v Speaker 2>the birth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your dad.</v>

2855
01:57:43.050 --> 01:57:44.650
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>

2856
01:57:44.730 --> 01:57:48.810
<v Speaker 2>That isn't an insane amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation and change.</v>

2857
01:57:48.930 --> 01:57:49.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and once we start becoming integrated </v>

2858
01:57:52.891 --> 01:57:56.460
<v Speaker 2>with the computers and then once they </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a part of your body,</v>

2859
01:57:56.640 --> 01:57:58.740
<v Speaker 2>that's when things are going to get so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking strange.</v>

2860
01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:00.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're gOing to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy,</v>

2861
01:58:01.650 --> 01:58:05.160
<v Speaker 2>did we play it on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who has the artificial legs that</v>

2862
01:58:05.161 --> 01:58:08.490
<v Speaker 2>are powered by neurochemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out doing that.</v>

2863
01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Did you play that after the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>showed you after the podcast,</v>

2864
01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:11.873
<v Speaker 2>put it on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it on for theo because this is the </v>

2865
01:58:13.441 --> 01:58:14.790
<v Speaker 2>craziest fucking thing ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2866
01:58:15.090 --> 01:58:15.923
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a way to make these </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial legs that work like real </v>

2867
01:58:21.181 --> 01:58:22.014
<v Speaker 2>legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for the longest time they've been </v>

2868
01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:24.713
<v Speaker 2>awkward and maybe strange and they got </v>
<v Speaker 2>better and they made some artificial </v>

2869
01:58:28.291 --> 01:58:29.124
<v Speaker 2>limbs for veterans that were were pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>passable and they can even walk without </v>

2870
01:58:32.401 --> 01:58:33.234
<v Speaker 2>a limp if they pulled it off correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now now they've come up with </v>

2871
01:58:36.901 --> 01:58:37.734
<v Speaker 2>something that you're controlling with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind and it's like a machine and </v>

2872
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:44.740
<v Speaker 2>they have their essentially bionic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bionic legs,</v>

2873
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:45.783
<v Speaker 2>and these are functional like they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>real people that have these artificial </v>

2874
01:58:48.941 --> 01:58:52.600
<v Speaker 2>legs attach to their body and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>neural impulses.</v>

2875
01:58:52.630 --> 01:58:53.463
<v Speaker 2>The normal impulses that trigger tissue </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement on a regular person make it </v>

2876
01:58:57.730 --> 01:58:59.230
<v Speaker 2>happen under this new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>

2877
01:58:59.530 --> 01:59:02.560
<v Speaker 2>hugh herr is the father of bionic </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>

2878
01:59:02.561 --> 01:59:03.394
<v Speaker 2>He has designed his own prosthesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost both of his legs in a climbing </v>

2879
01:59:07.391 --> 01:59:08.224
<v Speaker 2>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this guy engineered these artificial </v>

2880
01:59:11.190 --> 01:59:12.023
<v Speaker 2>legs up a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was 17 and he decided to become an </v>

2881
01:59:14.891 --> 01:59:15.724
<v Speaker 2>engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>found a solution to the problem it will </v>

2882
01:59:16.961 --> 01:59:20.330
<v Speaker 2>do away with outdated prosthetics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he had been given a.</v>

2883
01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:21.393
<v Speaker 2>So this guy developed these legs that </v>
<v Speaker 2>make him walk like he's walking with </v>

2884
01:59:25.841 --> 01:59:27.600
<v Speaker 2>short sawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at.</v>

2885
01:59:27.610 --> 01:59:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Look at how they're injecting it into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can feel and move from sales.</v>

2886
01:59:31.751 --> 01:59:33.640
<v Speaker 2>From the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2887
01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:35.140
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2888
01:59:35.141 --> 01:59:37.000
<v Speaker 2>This guy is moving it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone can use them.</v>

2889
01:59:37.001 --> 01:59:38.680
<v Speaker 2>He can dance with them on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can run.</v>

2890
01:59:38.710 --> 01:59:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking running.</v>

2891
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:42.730
<v Speaker 2>You can run with them.</v>

2892
01:59:42.730 --> 01:59:45.670
<v Speaker 2>You can go upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The coming together of man and robot.</v>

2893
01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:50.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is again human limitations.</v>

2894
01:59:50.250 --> 01:59:53.260
<v Speaker 2>So that's his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's riding his back bro.</v>

2895
01:59:53.290 --> 01:59:57.140
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that boston dynamics robot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They showed the other yesterday or going</v>

2896
01:59:57.480 --> 02:00:02.480
<v Speaker 2>to play that because one day a human is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get these legs like this boston</v>

2897
02:00:03.611 --> 02:00:05.980
<v Speaker 2>dynamics robot wants to jump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a man.</v>

2898
02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:07.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a robot.</v>

2899
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:08.183
<v Speaker 2>It's like a terminator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robot can jump like six feet in the air </v>

2900
02:00:09.581 --> 02:00:10.450
<v Speaker 2>or some shit like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2901
02:00:10.451 --> 02:00:14.890
<v Speaker 2>see it's just a matter of time here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People take their feet off and put these</v>

2902
02:00:14.891 --> 02:00:15.724
<v Speaker 2>fucking things on and rolled down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highway and we're going to choose those </v>

2903
02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:18.993
<v Speaker 2>demon legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those backwards horse type legs because </v>

2904
02:00:21.311 --> 02:00:22.144
<v Speaker 2>apparently they're more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more efficient springs and you </v>

2905
02:00:24.881 --> 02:00:26.790
<v Speaker 2>sit down on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter where you.</v>

2906
02:00:26.830 --> 02:00:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Does that scare you when you watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you looked at it?</v>

2907
02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Depends on how high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm prettY high right now.</v>

2908
02:00:32.270 --> 02:00:35.520
<v Speaker 2>Fairly scares me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It scares me because it's um,</v>

2909
02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:38.380
<v Speaker 2>it's changed and it's radical change and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably coming at a,</v>

2910
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:39.640
<v Speaker 2>at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a,</v>

2911
02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:42.450
<v Speaker 2>at a pace that we can't really manage </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2912
02:00:42.490 --> 02:00:43.323
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think is the scariest </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing about the change that we're </v>

2913
02:00:44.861 --> 02:00:46.870
<v Speaker 2>experiencing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's happening so fast.</v>

2914
02:00:46.871 --> 02:00:47.704
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to be able to manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not gonna be able to predict </v>

2915
02:00:49.931 --> 02:00:51.730
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it's a good thing or bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2916
02:00:51.731 --> 02:00:53.830
<v Speaker 2>and even if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do predict that it's a bad thing.</v>

2917
02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:56.490
<v Speaker 2>We're not gonnA be able to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2918
02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:59.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a crazy race going on and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't exactly know what the goal is,</v>

2919
02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:02.830
<v Speaker 2>but there's a crazy race to innovate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep coming up with better and better</v>

2920
02:01:02.831 --> 02:01:04.180
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's better,</v>

2921
02:01:04.181 --> 02:01:07.330
<v Speaker 2>laptops are better computers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all leading somewhere.</v>

2922
02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:08.173
<v Speaker 2>We're not exactly sure where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're chasing the best product </v>

2923
02:01:10.511 --> 02:01:11.344
<v Speaker 2>available possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that contributes to this sort of </v>

2924
02:01:13.661 --> 02:01:18.340
<v Speaker 2>matrix of technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this incredible sort of,</v>

2925
02:01:18.341 --> 02:01:19.174
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this environment where if you looked at </v>

2926
02:01:22.781 --> 02:01:25.390
<v Speaker 2>like the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you looked at it as like a,</v>

2927
02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:26.673
<v Speaker 2>like a life form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's evolving quicker than anything </v>

2928
02:01:28.721 --> 02:01:30.280
<v Speaker 2>we've ever seen ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2929
02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:31.273
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>EverythiNg else from the champs that </v>

2930
02:01:34.151 --> 02:01:37.780
<v Speaker 2>were talking about earlier to bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the snake that was eating the snake,</v>

2931
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:41.090
<v Speaker 2>they all evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've all slowly changed.</v>

2932
02:01:41.150 --> 02:01:43.970
<v Speaker 2>There's been natural selection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been random mutations is,</v>

2933
02:01:43.971 --> 02:01:44.804
<v Speaker 2>but all sorts of factors that allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to get to the state they're at </v>

2934
02:01:46.761 --> 02:01:47.594
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've never seen anything like </v>

2935
02:01:48.711 --> 02:01:49.544
<v Speaker 2>technology mean from my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from my day I had a computer in 1999 or </v>

2936
02:01:55.761 --> 02:01:58.340
<v Speaker 2>something like that and had like a four </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigabyte hard drive.</v>

2937
02:01:58.341 --> 02:01:59.660
<v Speaker 2>And I thought it was the shit kenny.</v>

2938
02:01:59.670 --> 02:02:02.120
<v Speaker 2>And believe this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four gigabyte,</v>

2939
02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:06.680
<v Speaker 2>now your phone has a 128 gigabytes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now every new phone that comes out,</v>

2940
02:02:06.681 --> 02:02:08.720
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be even bigger and bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to 300,</v>

2941
02:02:08.721 --> 02:02:09.554
<v Speaker 2>260 gigabytes and terabytes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laptops have a terabyte on a regular </v>

2942
02:02:14.031 --> 02:02:16.520
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that that is a thousand megabytes,</v>

2943
02:02:16.521 --> 02:02:17.354
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this incredible environment now </v>

2944
02:02:20.991 --> 02:02:22.910
<v Speaker 2>where everything is getting better all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

2945
02:02:22.911 --> 02:02:27.460
<v Speaker 2>whether it's cars or tvs or phones and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's happening right in front of us were</v>

2946
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:29.180
<v Speaker 2>just sitting there watching it and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>helping it.</v>

2947
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:30.800
<v Speaker 2>We're helping it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're feeding it.</v>

2948
02:02:31.090 --> 02:02:33.200
<v Speaker 2>We're in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The newest shit comes out.</v>

2949
02:02:33.201 --> 02:02:35.870
<v Speaker 2>You can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a line outside the apple store.</v>

2950
02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:36.913
<v Speaker 2>Please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please show me what's going to replace </v>

2951
02:02:39.561 --> 02:02:40.394
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to see it yet no little step </v>

2952
02:02:42.351 --> 02:02:43.580
<v Speaker 2>closer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2953
02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:48.500
<v Speaker 2>this one takes your fingerprint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next one takes your dna.</v>

2954
02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next one you blow into,</v>

2955
02:02:50.121 --> 02:02:50.800
<v Speaker 2>it powers it.</v>

2956
02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:51.633
<v Speaker 2>It literally feeds off your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the next one's in electric chimp </v>

2957
02:02:54.591 --> 02:02:55.424
<v Speaker 2>that takes you a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this one goes right up your ass like </v>

2958
02:02:57.141 --> 02:02:59.290
<v Speaker 2>a fucking tampon and then we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2959
02:02:59.770 --> 02:03:01.100
<v Speaker 2>They have one that wraps around your </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk.</v>

2960
02:03:01.101 --> 02:03:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nokia just came out with one.</v>

2961
02:03:02.691 --> 02:03:04.070
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is you waLk,</v>

2962
02:03:04.130 --> 02:03:04.963
<v Speaker 2>they have a cell phone and you walk </v>
<v Speaker 2>right up to your fucking wrist and go </v>

2963
02:03:07.581 --> 02:03:09.730
<v Speaker 2>like that flap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it slapped one of them.</v>

2964
02:03:09.810 --> 02:03:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Little rubber bands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that kids have bracelets.</v>

2965
02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:13.453
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slap bracelets and it just slaps around </v>

2966
02:03:14.810 --> 02:03:15.643
<v Speaker 2>your wrist and as a flexible screen you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could look at your screen on your wrist </v>

2967
02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:21.110
<v Speaker 2>while it's like showing you your email </v>
<v Speaker 2>and who's calling.</v>

2968
02:03:21.370 --> 02:03:24.140
<v Speaker 3>I remember when radar came out and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the big thing around us.</v>

2969
02:03:24.141 --> 02:03:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Radar.</v>

2970
02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People loved radar.</v>

2971
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Radar detectors.</v>

2972
02:03:30.530 --> 02:03:32.830
<v Speaker 3>Let the fuckers aren't gettIng me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

2973
02:03:32.831 --> 02:03:33.664
<v Speaker 3>My body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my buddies used to just drive </v>

2974
02:03:36.641 --> 02:03:38.410
<v Speaker 3>around the grocery store and just hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>it beep,</v>

2975
02:03:38.411 --> 02:03:40.810
<v Speaker 3>but he went by the electric doors in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>front of his mind.</v>

2976
02:03:40.811 --> 02:03:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Still does that to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that radar detector.</v>

2977
02:03:43.521 --> 02:03:45.970
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did I miss the old days,</v>

2978
02:03:45.971 --> 02:03:46.691
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes.</v>

2979
02:03:46.691 --> 02:03:47.524
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like a,</v>

2980
02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:48.713
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those naysayers that believes </v>

2981
02:03:49.691 --> 02:03:52.570
<v Speaker 3>that the future isn't going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I surely miss the old days.</v>

2982
02:03:52.571 --> 02:03:54.510
<v Speaker 3>I miss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I miss old diseases.</v>

2983
02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:55.353
<v Speaker 3>I miss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I miss old when people had ailments and </v>

2984
02:03:59.471 --> 02:04:01.960
<v Speaker 3>handicaps and it was just part of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2985
02:04:02.010 --> 02:04:05.590
<v Speaker 3>every battle wasn't fixed and corrected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's still the case for now.</v>

2986
02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:09.430
<v Speaker 3>But eventually I'm going to bionic legs.</v>

<v Speaker 3>different than.</v>

2990
02:04:14.231 --> 02:04:15.064
<v Speaker 3>I remember they had a dude who broken </v>
<v Speaker 3>his neck and he just heard his clavicle </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess so.</v>

3019
02:05:19.231 --> 02:05:20.064
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe I just missed the visual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was making us miss that time and it </v>

3020
02:05:22.671 --> 02:05:24.240
<v Speaker 2>was just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things seemed a little slower.</v>

3021
02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:25.133
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people always long for the past years </v>

3022
02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:27.450
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3023
02:05:27.450 --> 02:05:28.860
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feeling of nostalgia,</v>

3024
02:05:28.861 --> 02:05:31.890
<v Speaker 2>especially to people that never really </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally felt secure during that time.</v>

3025
02:05:32.170 --> 02:05:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Sort of romanticize that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3026
02:05:35.161 --> 02:05:37.920
<v Speaker 2>I state this one girl she used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>vacillate between her childhood was this</v>

3027
02:05:37.921 --> 02:05:40.680
<v Speaker 2>amazing dream and her childhood was </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>

3028
02:05:41.090 --> 02:05:41.923
<v Speaker 2>He never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never get a straight answer out of </v>

3029
02:05:42.991 --> 02:05:46.770
<v Speaker 2>her Like either she would tell you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>her childhood was this terrible,</v>

3030
02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:47.633
<v Speaker 2>terrible life that was just constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>filled with stress and pressure and </v>

3031
02:05:51.121 --> 02:05:51.954
<v Speaker 2>yelling and fighting and everyone was </v>
<v Speaker 2>poor and no one can pay the bills and </v>

3032
02:05:55.111 --> 02:05:55.944
<v Speaker 2>then sometimes she would describe it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be like this wonderful magical </v>

3033
02:05:58.891 --> 02:05:59.724
<v Speaker 2>time and everything was beautiful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing and if she could only go back </v>

3034
02:06:02.641 --> 02:06:04.230
<v Speaker 2>then when life was simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like,</v>

3035
02:06:04.231 --> 02:06:05.700
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

3036
02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:11.600
<v Speaker 2>You have this delusional perception of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the past that you occasionally adopt,</v>

3037
02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:12.773
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about your childhood and the scars that </v>

3038
02:06:15.491 --> 02:06:17.880
<v Speaker 2>it's left with you and they fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your head all day long,</v>

3039
02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:18.893
<v Speaker 2>but then occasionally you'll pull out </v>
<v Speaker 2>some bullshit version of your life and </v>

3040
02:06:22.030 --> 02:06:24.350
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're looking at some like,</v>

3041
02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:25.213
<v Speaker 2>like a memory scene in a movie where </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is blurry and perfect music </v>

3042
02:06:27.991 --> 02:06:28.824
<v Speaker 2>is playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is thAt a survival skill or just </v>

3043
02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:32.220
<v Speaker 2>something where she's nut to thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's definitely nuts,</v>

3044
02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:33.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3045
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:36.000
<v Speaker 2>She was definitely nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a survival skill.</v>

3046
02:06:36.001 --> 02:06:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I think people that grew up in horrific </v>
<v Speaker 2>childhoods especially,</v>

3047
02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:43.680
<v Speaker 2>they have a way of a longing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The longing for that past they long.</v>

3048
02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:46.950
<v Speaker 2>They have so much nostalgia that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>distort their memories,</v>

3049
02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:48.950
<v Speaker 2>but memories are fucked up anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3050
02:06:48.980 --> 02:06:49.813
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy how they alter as you get </v>

3051
02:06:50.371 --> 02:06:51.950
<v Speaker 2>older and you can all.</v>

3052
02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:52.833
<v Speaker 2>You can almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you plant the seed now of what could </v>

3053
02:06:55.711 --> 02:06:56.544
<v Speaker 2>be a memory later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will almost become a real memory </v>

3054
02:06:59.011 --> 02:07:00.180
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

3055
02:07:00.181 --> 02:07:01.040
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3056
02:07:01.110 --> 02:07:03.150
<v Speaker 2>You can definitely manipulate your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

3057
02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:04.133
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you can't even trust yourself these </v>

3058
02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:07.250
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did any.</v>

3059
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:08.183
<v Speaker 2>Any day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The human memory is not designed to </v>

3060
02:07:10.141 --> 02:07:10.974
<v Speaker 2>recall the past and perfect order is </v>
<v Speaker 2>designed to remember what's dangerous </v>

3061
02:07:14.041 --> 02:07:15.270
<v Speaker 2>and what's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep moving.</v>

3062
02:07:15.390 --> 02:07:16.141
<v Speaker 2>Who do you like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3063
02:07:16.141 --> 02:07:17.190
<v Speaker 2>I liked deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They deal.</v>

3064
02:07:17.191 --> 02:07:18.180
<v Speaker 2>What's up dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you.</v>

3065
02:07:18.470 --> 02:07:19.470
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're.</v>

3066
02:07:19.471 --> 02:07:21.600
<v Speaker 2>You were around people that you trust </v>
<v Speaker 2>and care for.</v>

3067
02:07:21.601 --> 02:07:23.820
<v Speaker 2>You remember that you remember things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they did bad,</v>

3068
02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.100
<v Speaker 2>like I fucking hit me with that rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that piece of shit,</v>

3069
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:27.143
<v Speaker 2>and you start saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're not designed for these </v>

3070
02:07:28.231 --> 02:07:29.064
<v Speaker 2>longterm strategies for the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>remembering what the fuck happened 30 </v>

3071
02:07:32.071 --> 02:07:33.780
<v Speaker 2>years ago when you were in high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

3072
02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:34.980
<v Speaker 2>You know so you're not going to remember</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3073
02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:36.490
<v Speaker 2>ThAt stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you do,</v>

3074
02:07:36.491 --> 02:07:38.830
<v Speaker 2>it'll be all fucked up and jumbled up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain.</v>

3075
02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:40.490
<v Speaker 2>It won't be accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you?</v>

3076
02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.240
<v Speaker 2>have you seen that show black mirror?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about.</v>

3077
02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:44.950
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a couple episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two episodes.</v>

3078
02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:45.813
<v Speaker 2>There's an episode where the woman's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman's husband passes away and they </v>

3079
02:07:49.481 --> 02:07:54.481
<v Speaker 2>have enough audio of him online where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>can now they can take all that audio and</v>

3080
02:07:55.601 --> 02:07:56.434
<v Speaker 2>mix it together and she can now talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>him online because enough of his voice </v>

3081
02:07:59.871 --> 02:08:00.704
<v Speaker 2>is in the internet and you having this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you even imagine you're going to </v>

3082
02:08:03.611 --> 02:08:04.444
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could potentially be interviewing </v>

3083
02:08:05.381 --> 02:08:06.760
<v Speaker 2>people forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

3084
02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Even after you're gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

3085
02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it still won't work because I don't.</v>

3086
02:08:10.810 --> 02:08:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't know what he would have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>an actual.</v>

3087
02:08:13.241 --> 02:08:14.074
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're going to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone in a podcast interviewing </v>

3088
02:08:15.710 --> 02:08:17.490
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have to be the actual person in</v>

3089
02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:19.360
<v Speaker 2>because you don't really know what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>will say.</v>

3090
02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:20.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what the fuck I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to say,</v>

3091
02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:22.780
<v Speaker 2>but they'd have the best database of </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody like you.</v>

3092
02:08:22.781 --> 02:08:24.550
<v Speaker 2>To be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're got a good database,</v>

3093
02:08:24.551 --> 02:08:26.110
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3094
02:08:26.111 --> 02:08:28.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not real time and it's not based in</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3095
02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:29.193
<v Speaker 2>It's not in the moment at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought that that was pretty </v>

3096
02:08:31.211 --> 02:08:33.240
<v Speaker 2>fascinating that they could even do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

3097
02:08:33.490 --> 02:08:35.580
<v Speaker 2>It's only the beginning of what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to do.</v>

3098
02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:38.200
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna be able to recreate your </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought patterns to the point where they</v>

3099
02:08:38.201 --> 02:08:41.920
<v Speaker 2>could recreate how you would feel and </v>
<v Speaker 2>think and I think how you feel and think</v>

3100
02:08:41.921 --> 02:08:43.540
<v Speaker 2>is a lot of time dependent upon your </v>
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>

3101
02:08:43.580 --> 02:08:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's been many times where I was</v>

3102
02:08:45.611 --> 02:08:46.444
<v Speaker 2>just really tired and I just wasn't the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same person that I would be if I was </v>

3103
02:08:48.761 --> 02:08:49.594
<v Speaker 2>really awake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3104
02:08:49.620 --> 02:08:50.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so who is that?</v>

3105
02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:51.730
<v Speaker 2>Am I the same guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3106
02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:54.910
<v Speaker 2>because if you put me in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>scenario with the same person saying the</v>

3107
02:08:54.911 --> 02:08:55.744
<v Speaker 2>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but have a different reaction to it </v>

3108
02:08:56.981 --> 02:08:57.814
<v Speaker 2>based on how I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the reasons why I think </v>

3109
02:08:59.801 --> 02:09:03.130
<v Speaker 2>it's so important to optimize your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your physical health,</v>

3110
02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:06.130
<v Speaker 2>it's so important to have as much energy</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you can all the time,</v>

3111
02:09:06.150 --> 02:09:07.480
<v Speaker 2>but great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then when you're talking to people,</v>

3112
02:09:07.481 --> 02:09:10.270
<v Speaker 2>you have a positive excellent response </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

3113
02:09:10.271 --> 02:09:11.104
<v Speaker 2>You Have like a good feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take it and like whatever you </v>

3114
02:09:12.881 --> 02:09:13.714
<v Speaker 2>experience in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to be weighed down by </v>

3115
02:09:15.251 --> 02:09:16.084
<v Speaker 2>your physical body to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't enjoy the experience as much </v>

3116
02:09:18.430 --> 02:09:20.020
<v Speaker 2>as you could if you were feeling healthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and happy.</v>

3117
02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're the best part.</v>

3118
02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:25.140
<v Speaker 2>You can't even get to the surface to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>there to resonate with the other person.</v>

3119
02:09:25.150 --> 02:09:28.300
<v Speaker 2>Cranky tires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're hung over man.</v>

3120
02:09:28.380 --> 02:09:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Also worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3121
02:09:30.010 --> 02:09:30.843
<v Speaker 2>drink man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I quit drinking because that hangover </v>

3122
02:09:31.850 --> 02:09:32.860
<v Speaker 2>just couldn't take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3123
02:09:33.010 --> 02:09:35.470
<v Speaker 2>It's the worst drug they think they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to fit.</v>

3124
02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:37.210
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a way to cure </v>
<v Speaker 2>hangovers.</v>

3125
02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Some guys said that by 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like 20,</v>

3126
02:09:40.061 --> 02:09:40.894
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will have cured hangovers and </v>

3127
02:09:42.701 --> 02:09:45.580
<v Speaker 2>figured out some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some new method to cure hangovers.</v>

3128
02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:47.890
<v Speaker 2>So literally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what separates doesn't mean you say,</v>

3129
02:09:47.891 --> 02:09:48.724
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about all these things </v>

3130
02:09:49.181 --> 02:09:51.250
<v Speaker 2>about the future because you really seem</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a future man,</v>

3131
02:09:51.251 --> 02:09:52.380
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3132
02:09:52.810 --> 02:09:54.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make a new sHirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Future man.</v>

3133
02:09:55.290 --> 02:09:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Now they have a cartoon I think called </v>
<v Speaker 2>future or something.</v>

3134
02:09:58.980 --> 02:09:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3136
02:10:01.881 --> 02:10:06.881

<v Speaker 2>no good anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no good.</v>

3140
02:10:12.250 --> 02:10:14.500
<v Speaker 2>I think you would pose the same question</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Australia.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Those fuckers were created.</v>

3143
02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:21.393
<v Speaker 2>If you went back then and talk to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people with sorta kinda people or </v>

3144

<v Speaker 2>in the middle of the fucking rockies as </v>

<v Speaker 2>The thing does not wait and you are a </v>

3169
02:11:18.141 --> 02:11:19.080
<v Speaker 2>part of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>But also this is like a human.</v>

3193
02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>

3194
02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:09.710
<v Speaker 2>you'll be something whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed is what you need.</v>

3195
02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:11.053
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if needed is what we all </v>

3196
02:12:11.691 --> 02:12:11.990
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>

3197
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:16.610
<v Speaker 2>We think we need needed because we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to feel unneeded or unnecessary.</v>

3198
02:12:16.611 --> 02:12:19.220
<v Speaker 2>So we'd like to be desired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we want to be needed,</v>

3199
02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:20.113
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually we're going to have to </v>

3200
02:12:21.861 --> 02:12:26.861
<v Speaker 2>probably replace that with fulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Replaced that with a joyful,</v>

3201
02:12:27.170 --> 02:12:28.003
<v Speaker 2>with gratitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with enjoying the experience that's </v>

3202
02:12:30.861 --> 02:12:32.450
<v Speaker 2>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough sell to.</v>

3203
02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:34.250
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be some changes.</v>

3204
02:12:34.710 --> 02:12:35.543
<v Speaker 2>We might eliminate emotions that might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was going to engineer something </v>

3205
02:12:38.910 --> 02:12:40.070
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not me,</v>

3206
02:12:40.130 --> 02:12:40.963
<v Speaker 2>but if I was someone looking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately innovate and get us past </v>

3207
02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:45.013
<v Speaker 2>where we are now as a species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're a certain leaps and </v>

3208
02:12:47.151 --> 02:12:48.950
<v Speaker 2>bounds of the human race is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to make.</v>

3209
02:12:49.490 --> 02:12:50.323
<v Speaker 2>One of the big ones I would have to saY </v>
<v Speaker 2>is we are always tripped up by our </v>

3210
02:12:52.911 --> 02:12:53.780
<v Speaker 2>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3211
02:12:53.810 --> 02:12:58.810
<v Speaker 2>We're constantly tripped up by anger and</v>
<v Speaker 2>jealousy and desire,</v>

3212
02:13:00.230 --> 02:13:01.063
<v Speaker 2>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mild racism or a serious racism or you </v>

3213
02:13:03.501 --> 02:13:04.334
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just distorted perceptions of reality </v>

3214
02:13:06.831 --> 02:13:07.664
<v Speaker 2>that are caused by the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not looking at things accurately to </v>

3215
02:13:10.581 --> 02:13:11.414
<v Speaker 2>protect you from the reality of who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are versus who you like to pretend you </v>

3216
02:13:14.481 --> 02:13:15.170
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

3217
02:13:15.170 --> 02:13:16.003
<v Speaker 2>All those dIfferent variables can hold </v>
<v Speaker 2>back people right now if they come up </v>

3218
02:13:20.001 --> 02:13:20.834
<v Speaker 2>with a way to ensure this ultimate bliss</v>
<v Speaker 2>state without any attachment to </v>

3219
02:13:25.581 --> 02:13:26.414
<v Speaker 2>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like you exist in a state of </v>

3220
02:13:29.001 --> 02:13:30.330
<v Speaker 2>constant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3221
02:13:30.530 --> 02:13:33.320
<v Speaker 2>ecstasy like taking the drug ecstasy </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3222
02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:38.370
<v Speaker 2>but an intelligent crafty thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>provoking,</v>

3223
02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:40.890
<v Speaker 2>moving forward ecstasy with no emotions </v>
<v Speaker 2>attached to it.</v>

3224
02:13:40.891 --> 02:13:42.570
<v Speaker 2>And no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no jealousy and no anger.</v>

3225
02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:43.853
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going to not go into that and be </v>

3226
02:13:45.471 --> 02:13:46.590
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be a champ?</v>

3227
02:13:46.710 --> 02:13:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to go back to chimp days </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you bite each other's dicks off and</v>

3228
02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:52.380
<v Speaker 2>bite your fingers off and killing each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other and eating each other?</v>

3229
02:13:52.381 --> 02:13:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you want to do or do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to go forward?</v>

3230
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to go forward,</v>

3231
02:13:54.990 --> 02:13:57.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might be several steps until we get</v>

3232
02:13:57.841 --> 02:13:58.674
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think ultimately we may very well </v>

3233
02:14:01.261 --> 02:14:02.094
<v Speaker 2>reach a point where we do not have </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions as we know them today because </v>

3234
02:14:06.331 --> 02:14:07.164
<v Speaker 2>they're not necessary because there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological artifacts of a time where we </v>

3235
02:14:11.671 --> 02:14:12.504
<v Speaker 2>were living tooth fang and claw trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect ourselves from other </v>

3236
02:14:16.411 --> 02:14:17.670
<v Speaker 2>organisms will not.</v>

3237
02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:18.533
<v Speaker 2>We might surpass that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We might reach some new state and that </v>

3238
02:14:21.181 --> 02:14:26.040
<v Speaker 2>might be the main tool or the main </v>
<v Speaker 2>ingredient,</v>

3239
02:14:26.070 --> 02:14:30.420
<v Speaker 2>the main element that we introduce into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the human species that allows us to take</v>

3240
02:14:30.421 --> 02:14:32.970
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cdm godlike level at because like</v>

3241
02:14:32.971 --> 02:14:34.440
<v Speaker 2>our new medium kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3242
02:14:34.441 --> 02:14:35.274
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think you become something that </v>

3243
02:14:36.691 --> 02:14:37.524
<v Speaker 2>you would never imagine exists now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like something that can engineer the </v>

3244
02:14:39.871 --> 02:14:42.150
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that can change a body turn,</v>

3245
02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:46.080
<v Speaker 2>turn something someone into something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've never experienced before,</v>

3246
02:14:46.110 --> 02:14:46.943
<v Speaker 2>make a mind infinitely more powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the mines that we currently </v>

3247
02:14:49.621 --> 02:14:51.090
<v Speaker 2>experienced with the greatest minds on </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

3248
02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:53.670
<v Speaker 2>If that's all engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's all possible.</v>

3249
02:14:53.850 --> 02:14:55.560
<v Speaker 2>You think our feelings will be like in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>museum?</v>

3250
02:14:56.220 --> 02:14:57.900
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be a relic.</v>

3251
02:14:58.050 --> 02:15:01.020
<v Speaker 2>There'll be a relic just like wearing no</v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes as a relic.</v>

3252
02:15:01.170 --> 02:15:03.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can go back to the amazon </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now and you could find people that</v>

3253
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:05.040
<v Speaker 2>aren't wearing any clothes.</v>

3254
02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:05.993
<v Speaker 2>Undiscovered tribes that they're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>going in there and logging and they </v>

3255
02:15:08.701 --> 02:15:11.550
<v Speaker 2>discover these fucking people and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting bows and arrows and helicopters</v>

3256
02:15:11.551 --> 02:15:12.540
<v Speaker 2>with cameras on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3257
02:15:12.610 --> 02:15:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Eating termites to see some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3258
02:15:14.850 --> 02:15:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck you can stay alive.</v>

3259
02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:18.720
<v Speaker 2>That's all a relic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3260
02:15:19.650 --> 02:15:20.483
<v Speaker 2>Let me just makes me nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes we're going into the matrix </v>

3261
02:15:22.430 --> 02:15:25.560
<v Speaker 2>they have on going into the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's happening.</v>

3262
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:29.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get my stuff first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you bring?</v>

3263
02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:30.450
<v Speaker 2>If I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>

3264
02:15:30.540 --> 02:15:31.820
<v Speaker 2>you can go into the matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3265
02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:35.400
<v Speaker 2>you can bring three things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to bring a picture of my family</v>

3266
02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:40.640
<v Speaker 2>and then I'd have to bring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>PrObably I bring some water,</v>

3267
02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:47.820
<v Speaker 2>would be water in the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be the guy without it.</v>

3268
02:15:47.821 --> 02:15:48.654
<v Speaker 2>And then imagine if you're the only one </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart enough to bring water and you're </v>

3269
02:15:51.511 --> 02:15:52.800
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well everybody hold the fuck on.</v>

3270
02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't have enough water for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Need some of that water.</v>

3271
02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:59.620
<v Speaker 2>And he give it to some of their local </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight them.</v>

3272
02:15:59.650 --> 02:16:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Try to get the water bags like fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm jagging the water of brother.</v>

3273
02:16:03.291 --> 02:16:06.090
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a brother would drink all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the water out my grass man.</v>

3274
02:16:06.270 --> 02:16:08.370
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably give it out and I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>take a knife in there.</v>

3275
02:16:08.371 --> 02:16:10.050
<v Speaker 2>Like a small knIfe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A small one.</v>

3276
02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:11.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe a toothbrush.</v>

3277
02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:17.970
<v Speaker 2>You're the only person with a fricken </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice grill and the matrix.</v>

3278
02:16:18.070 --> 02:16:19.610
<v Speaker 2>They're getting some pussy bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>

3279
02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:21.840
<v Speaker 2>You think you get posting in the matrix </v>
<v Speaker 2>from having a nice grill?</v>

3280
02:16:22.260 --> 02:16:23.180
<v Speaker 2>I hope so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3281
02:16:23.450 --> 02:16:26.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to be in there without</v>

3282
02:16:26.701 --> 02:16:27.534
<v Speaker 2>some of my little bit of a creature </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfort because I'm feeling </v>

3283
02:16:29.501 --> 02:16:30.334
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable on there because if I take</v>
<v Speaker 2>my same feelings and I feel </v>

3284
02:16:32.531 --> 02:16:33.364
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable when I'm in this matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand and I don't want to not at </v>

3285
02:16:37.421 --> 02:16:39.400
<v Speaker 2>least have something to clean my teeth </v>
<v Speaker 2>or to,</v>

3286
02:16:39.970 --> 02:16:42.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe like an like a scarf or something.</v>

3287
02:16:42.191 --> 02:16:43.024
<v Speaker 2>Something to make me feel more </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable or do you totally knoW what </v>

3288
02:16:46.061 --> 02:16:46.894
<v Speaker 2>you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3289
02:16:47.430 --> 02:16:48.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be the dude in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>matrix.</v>

3290
02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:49.610
<v Speaker 2>And what were you taken there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3291
02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:53.470
<v Speaker 2>I would assume that it physical objects </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be useless,</v>

3292
02:16:54.010 --> 02:16:55.330
<v Speaker 2>so I would just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3293
02:16:57.100 --> 02:16:58.390
<v Speaker 2>but the water might be a good idea.</v>

3294
02:16:59.250 --> 02:17:02.980
<v Speaker 2>An hour even split.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No water in the matrix.</v>

3295
02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:03.993
<v Speaker 2>I think the real problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is your life force is what you are </v>

3296
02:17:09.251 --> 02:17:12.130
<v Speaker 2>inside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like is a soul real and what if they can</v>

3297
02:17:12.131 --> 02:17:17.131
<v Speaker 2>scientifically isolate the soul if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can fit science figures out a way.</v>

3298
02:17:17.741 --> 02:17:20.560
<v Speaker 2>Like I know we didn't use to know where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the subatomIc particle was.</v>

3299
02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:22.690
<v Speaker 2>We didn't use to know where the cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

3300
02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:23.673
<v Speaker 2>We didn't use to know the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between multi-celled single celled </v>

3301
02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:26.650
<v Speaker 2>organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now we do,</v>

3302
02:17:26.730 --> 02:17:27.563
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if one day we get to a point where </v>

3303
02:17:28.430 --> 02:17:29.263
<v Speaker 2>like we've isolated the cell in a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see it the same way a dog and </v>

3304
02:17:32.351 --> 02:17:33.184
<v Speaker 2>see that magnetic field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've isolated it and in people and we </v>

3305
02:17:35.291 --> 02:17:38.080
<v Speaker 2>know what it is and you can actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it out of your body and transfer it</v>

3306
02:17:38.081 --> 02:17:40.330
<v Speaker 2>into the matrix and you will live now in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the matrix,</v>

3307
02:17:40.331 --> 02:17:41.164
<v Speaker 2>but your physical body will cease to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist and what if that's what happens </v>

3308
02:17:45.011 --> 02:17:45.980
<v Speaker 2>when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3309
02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:47.830
<v Speaker 2>What If that's exactly what happens when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you die?</v>

3310
02:17:47.831 --> 02:17:50.450
<v Speaker 2>What if that's why the dmts released in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind?</v>

3311
02:17:50.470 --> 02:17:55.470
<v Speaker 2>You blow through this kaleidoscope of </v>
<v Speaker 2>geometric patterns to this other place.</v>

3312
02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:58.840
<v Speaker 2>What if that is exactly what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that can happen.</v>

3313
02:17:59.350 --> 02:18:02.860
<v Speaker 2>THat feels most realistic to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also I think you could come back and</v>

3314
02:18:02.861 --> 02:18:04.720
<v Speaker 2>be reincarnated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could probably bounce back and forth</v>

3315
02:18:04.721 --> 02:18:06.220
<v Speaker 2>between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

3316
02:18:06.460 --> 02:18:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can be born,</v>

3317
02:18:07.780 --> 02:18:10.510
<v Speaker 2>why can't you be born again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like there was no evidence.</v>

3318
02:18:10.650 --> 02:18:11.483
<v Speaker 2>I know there's no evidence and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there you also know that you're </v>

3319
02:18:15.491 --> 02:18:16.271
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3320
02:18:16.271 --> 02:18:19.120
<v Speaker 2>That's the only evidence we have is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been here already wants.</v>

3321
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:20.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it seems most likely that that would </v>

3322
02:18:21.611 --> 02:18:22.420
<v Speaker 2>occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

3323
02:18:22.420 --> 02:18:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but totally possible.</v>

3324
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Would you get with a person can exist at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all if you can exist at all.</v>

3325
02:18:29.470 --> 02:18:33.580
<v Speaker 2>If whatever the fuck consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists in the form that is thiel vaughn,</v>

3326
02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:34.633
<v Speaker 2>you're telling me that you're absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that it doesn't pass through to </v>

3327
02:18:37.661 --> 02:18:41.290
<v Speaker 2>some next dimension when the physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>body deteriorates in this one.</v>

3328
02:18:41.530 --> 02:18:42.900
<v Speaker 2>You don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3329
02:18:43.090 --> 02:18:44.620
<v Speaker 2>you might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be right.</v>

3330
02:18:44.650 --> 02:18:47.130
<v Speaker 2>It might be the end people that are like</v>
<v Speaker 2>nihilists.</v>

3331
02:18:47.140 --> 02:18:49.960
<v Speaker 2>They're like the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body dies and that's it,</v>

3332
02:18:50.020 --> 02:18:52.930
<v Speaker 2>and you might be right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know that you're right.</v>

3333
02:18:52.931 --> 02:18:55.420
<v Speaker 2>So even saying That your body dies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

3334
02:18:56.060 --> 02:18:58.570
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as a,</v>

3335
02:18:58.571 --> 02:18:59.680
<v Speaker 2>you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and b,</v>

3336
02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:02.920
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you exist at all is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy.</v>

3337
02:19:03.250 --> 02:19:05.740
<v Speaker 2>Amen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we can talk right now,</v>

3338
02:19:06.250 --> 02:19:07.083
<v Speaker 2>people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people right now on road trips </v>

3339
02:19:08.651 --> 02:19:11.560
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You people out there in that car,</v>

3340
02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:13.330
<v Speaker 2>listen to this shit right now.</v>

3341
02:19:13.330 --> 02:19:14.163
<v Speaker 2>Laugh children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have children probably too high to </v>

3342
02:19:15.641 --> 02:19:19.990
<v Speaker 2>drive dan adults to to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were a part of this.</v>

3343
02:19:19.991 --> 02:19:20.824
<v Speaker 2>We're all part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we can experience each </v>

3344
02:19:22.660 --> 02:19:26.500
<v Speaker 2>other at all and the reason why we're so</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up as a culture,</v>

3345
02:19:26.501 --> 02:19:30.260
<v Speaker 2>one of the big reasons why we're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up as a as a civilization is that</v>

3346
02:19:30.410 --> 02:19:31.243
<v Speaker 2>we're somehow or another ignoring the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mystery of being alive as being this </v>

3347
02:19:35.211 --> 02:19:40.211
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre and wonderful and powerful thing</v>

3348
02:19:40.971 --> 02:19:44.180
<v Speaker 2>that just that you're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just that you're hearing these words.</v>

3349
02:19:44.181 --> 02:19:45.014
<v Speaker 2>Just that you and I are speaking these </v>
<v Speaker 2>words just that's how a guy like Donald </v>

3350
02:19:47.810 --> 02:19:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Trump gets into office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how things like this happen.</v>

3351
02:19:50.091 --> 02:19:52.880
<v Speaker 2>When the world gets tossed into </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication were all baffled,</v>

3352
02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:54.133
<v Speaker 2>baffled by it all and still figuring out</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the fly and we're stuck with these </v>

3353
02:19:57.770 --> 02:20:02.770
<v Speaker 2>archaic models of government and control</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were designed back when people were</v>

3354
02:20:03.651 --> 02:20:06.260
<v Speaker 2>riding rafts across the fucking ocean.</v>

3355
02:20:06.260 --> 02:20:08.980
<v Speaker 2>With the power of the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally whatever.</v>

3356
02:20:09.010 --> 02:20:13.360
<v Speaker 2>We're doing a huckleberry finn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3357
02:20:13.370 --> 02:20:15.290
<v Speaker 2>now I'm thinking of something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mayflower,</v>

3358
02:20:15.530 --> 02:20:17.600
<v Speaker 2>the mayflower pinta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the santa maria,</v>

3359
02:20:17.601 --> 02:20:18.434
<v Speaker 2>all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3360
02:20:18.470 --> 02:20:21.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean we are bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just being alive is very strange.</v>

3361
02:20:21.921 --> 02:20:23.360
<v Speaker 2>People don't meet up and talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

3362
02:20:23.361 --> 02:20:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Then we don't have time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3363
02:20:24.870 --> 02:20:25.703
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're keeping ourselves busy work and </v>

3364
02:20:26.811 --> 02:20:30.380
<v Speaker 2>creating these objects and buying these </v>
<v Speaker 2>objects were creating these objects.</v>

3365
02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:31.730
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you're not well,</v>

3366
02:20:31.731 --> 02:20:33.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't work in technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your theory doesn't Work.</v>

3367
02:20:33.751 --> 02:20:35.870
<v Speaker 2>Yes you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You work to buy technology.</v>

3368
02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:38.450
<v Speaker 2>You don't think you work in technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your labor,</v>

3369
02:20:38.451 --> 02:20:40.370
<v Speaker 2>no matter what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you change tires,</v>

3370
02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:43.520
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our labor is helping technology innovate</v>

3371
02:20:43.521 --> 02:20:44.354
<v Speaker 2>because you're going to buy a new phone </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're going to buy a new tv and </v>

3372
02:20:46.461 --> 02:20:48.140
<v Speaker 2>you're going to buy a new computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're helping.</v>

3373
02:20:48.141 --> 02:20:50.690
<v Speaker 2>You're all feeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're working towards technology.</v>

3374
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:53.360
<v Speaker 2>You just don't think you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody is.</v>

3375
02:20:54.020 --> 02:20:55.070
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

3376
02:20:57.250 --> 02:20:58.730
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous now.</v>

3377
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now there's no need.</v>

3378
02:21:03.090 --> 02:21:05.180
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part of the trick of life</v>

3379
02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:07.520
<v Speaker 2>is that it's always going to feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

3380
02:21:07.521 --> 02:21:09.020
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to end,</v>

3381
02:21:09.410 --> 02:21:10.243
<v Speaker 2>but you got to enjoy it while you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to enjoy this because right now </v>

3382
02:21:12.291 --> 02:21:13.430
<v Speaker 2>it's not ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3383
02:21:13.460 --> 02:21:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I had a dream the other night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a fucked up dream,</v>

3384
02:21:15.261 --> 02:21:17.060
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a choice of forum before we move</v>

3385
02:21:17.061 --> 02:21:18.320
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you get a choice,</v>

3386
02:21:18.321 --> 02:21:20.630
<v Speaker 2>if you move into that matrix or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think?</v>

3387
02:21:20.690 --> 02:21:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

3388
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.863
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you get a chance to just stay in </v>

3389
02:21:25.281 --> 02:21:26.114
<v Speaker 2>limbo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe get a chance to go into the dmt </v>

3390
02:21:27.921 --> 02:21:30.320
<v Speaker 2>world and just danced with the ils for </v>
<v Speaker 2>all eternity.</v>

3391
02:21:30.520 --> 02:21:31.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might or you might relax and give into </v>

3392
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:35.833
<v Speaker 2>love so much that all of a sudden you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>opening your eyes and you're looking at </v>

3393
02:21:38.121 --> 02:21:38.954
<v Speaker 2>your mother and you're a baby and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>start from scratch and you tried to do </v>

3394
02:21:41.991 --> 02:21:42.260
<v Speaker 2>it right.</v>

3395
02:21:42.260 --> 02:21:44.750
<v Speaker 2>This time I'm going to moscow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3396
02:21:44.751 --> 02:21:46.850
<v Speaker 2>that's where I want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to be born in moscow?</v>

3397
02:21:46.950 --> 02:21:47.781
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to go there.</v>

3398
02:21:47.781 --> 02:21:50.060
<v Speaker 2>like if you do that at all at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3399
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:52.340
<v Speaker 2>like if you get a pickup one more spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't been,</v>

3400
02:21:52.341 --> 02:21:53.174
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you imagine how vulnerable you would </v>

3401
02:21:53.991 --> 02:21:56.960
<v Speaker 2>feel if you were reborn as a baby and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were in any way aware of the.</v>

3402
02:21:56.961 --> 02:21:58.220
<v Speaker 2>You already lived this life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3403
02:21:58.221 --> 02:21:59.960
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta do this again.</v>

3404
02:22:00.420 --> 02:22:01.253
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you've got to look at your </v>

3405
02:22:02.091 --> 02:22:04.250
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd just be so filled with how</v>

3406
02:22:04.251 --> 02:22:07.110
<v Speaker 2>much love you probably have for in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

3407
02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:09.260
<v Speaker 2>That's a good attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good perception.</v>

3408
02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's interesting though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating to think that what if</v>

3409
02:22:13.111 --> 02:22:13.944
<v Speaker 2>you got to just have just a moment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like threw a baby was just through a </v>

3410
02:22:16.701 --> 02:22:17.534
<v Speaker 2>baby's eyes or through your mother's </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes and see what you looked like or </v>

3411
02:22:19.641 --> 02:22:24.641
<v Speaker 2>through like if you got to just go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through to see what the roots of it all.</v>

3412
02:22:24.771 --> 02:22:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Where now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's manager?</v>

3413
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:29.490
<v Speaker 2>have you ever heard the stories of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>three year old past lives?</v>

3414
02:22:29.491 --> 02:22:31.900
<v Speaker 2>They've tried to tell our parents say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that their kids have told it.</v>

3415
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:32.743
<v Speaker 2>Started saying really weird things and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>always think those people are full of </v>

3416
02:22:34.741 --> 02:22:37.350
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He took a chance and he came over from </v>

3531
02:27:20.381 --> 02:27:22.840
<v Speaker 2>the east coast or somewhere somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>east.</v>

3532
02:27:23.170 --> 02:27:28.000
<v Speaker 2>Made it all the way out to Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Took a patch of land and died out there.</v>

3533
02:27:28.390 --> 02:27:29.223
<v Speaker 2>And you could find that little house and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe sometimes there's a little </v>

3534
02:27:31.511 --> 02:27:34.850
<v Speaker 2>cemetery there to where the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to live there buried in.</v>

3535
02:27:34.890 --> 02:27:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you think he feels any differently </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he died then?</v>

3536
02:27:37.081 --> 02:27:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Like you were outfield when we die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real good question.</v>

3537
02:27:40.510 --> 02:27:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Like does his wonder if his a real good </v>
<v Speaker 2>question?</v>

3538
02:27:43.361 --> 02:27:44.194
<v Speaker 2>I bet everybody goes scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't like if you die in beverly </v>

3539
02:27:46.451 --> 02:27:47.284
<v Speaker 2>hills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think it's any better than dying </v>

3540
02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:49.840
<v Speaker 2>in the jungle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3541
02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:51.720
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3542
02:27:51.950 --> 02:27:54.400
<v Speaker 2>That'S ultimately what's hilarious about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all.</v>

3543
02:27:54.670 --> 02:27:55.503
<v Speaker 2>At the end it's a complete and total </v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of control and that's what's so </v>

3544
02:27:57.851 --> 02:27:58.684
<v Speaker 2>terrifying to us because we go through </v>
<v Speaker 2>our lives trying the best we can to </v>

3545
02:28:02.351 --> 02:28:06.790
<v Speaker 2>maintain as much control as possible and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fail almost every step of the way.</v>

3546
02:28:06.791 --> 02:28:07.624
<v Speaker 2>And then ultimatelY the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have control over is our ability to </v>

3547
02:28:11.951 --> 02:28:14.290
<v Speaker 2>let go of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3548
02:28:14.410 --> 02:28:16.270
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3549
02:28:16.271 --> 02:28:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately,</v>

3550
02:28:17.351 --> 02:28:22.190
<v Speaker 2>the only thing we really have is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding</v>

3551
02:28:22.490 --> 02:28:26.900
<v Speaker 6>that this is a temporary existence and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to come to a time where the</v>

3552
02:28:26.901 --> 02:28:27.734
<v Speaker 6>ride ends and everybody's right ends and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just have to face that and it's </v>

3553
02:28:32.470 --> 02:28:33.303
<v Speaker 6>scary</v>
