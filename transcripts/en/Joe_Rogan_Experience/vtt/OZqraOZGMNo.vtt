1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.030
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.720
<v Speaker 1>And then you can't trust if you're are</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 80 year old billionaire,</v>

3
00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>you can't trust a girl who's willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you with tapes,</v>

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.860
<v Speaker 1>exact test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then it's like a lot of like,</v>

5
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.870
<v Speaker 1>it's like three people fucking up.</v>

6
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.440
<v Speaker 2>You know what I thought was the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre about all of it?</v>

7
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently I was correct and that what</v>

8
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.980
<v Speaker 2>she is as far as the most recent story</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that she was supposed to record his</v>

9
00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:32.030
<v Speaker 2>saying his conversations because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would say things and then forgot he sat</v>

10
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:32.864
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

11
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.010
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got,</v>

12
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.890
<v Speaker 2>he's dementia 81 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these old as fuck.</v>

13
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 2>So he would say crazy things and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would record them and you know,</v>

14
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:44.050
<v Speaker 2>and let him know like what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

15
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.460
<v Speaker 2>Well in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another,</v>

16
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 2>it got leaked how it got leaked to</v>
<v Speaker 2>speculation,</v>

17
00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 2>but he knew he was being recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

18
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.323
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

19
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.010
<v Speaker 1>So you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's against the law,</v>

20
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>the record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone like what if they don't say</v>

21
00:00:57.531 --> 00:00:59.600
<v Speaker 1>anything and it's just bathroom noises</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>

22
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.820
<v Speaker 1>It's against the law still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if they don't talk in it.</v>

23
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In California,</v>

24
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 1>they don't know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's against the law.</v>

25
00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The essence can be like if you just put</v>

26
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:11.210
<v Speaker 1>a tape recorder down behind the toilet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't say a word.</v>

27
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:12.490
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>and then they leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's still against a law even though</v>

29
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:16.940
<v Speaker 1>they don't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It said they're just their spirit being</v>

30
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:17.570
<v Speaker 1>in the room.</v>

31
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.370
<v Speaker 2>The noises of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

32
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.270
<v Speaker 2>being recorded are actual physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>presence being marked by the sound of</v>

33
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:25.160
<v Speaker 2>their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably illegal.</v>

34
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 3>That's why they used to tape crank and</v>
<v Speaker 3>criminal.</v>

36
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 3>So I said he guilty as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

37
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.500
<v Speaker 3>if you take a tape and put it in behind</v>
<v Speaker 3>the toilets in Bourbon,</v>

38
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.791
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

39
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:42.140
<v Speaker 3>and the girl might happen to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>stripper,</v>

40
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.263
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

41
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.860
<v Speaker 3>That combination is never gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it did,</v>

42
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.430
<v Speaker 3>it's just they know that you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>recording her pooping.</v>

43
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because I guess so the</v>
<v Speaker 3>recording like no,</v>

44
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:53.691
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

45
00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:55.930
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting fucking spaces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

46
00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:59.210
<v Speaker 3>When we talk about that you clam up when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

47
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.610
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't require people pooping.</v>

48
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 2>The real issue with putting all of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>eggs in one basket and that basket being</v>

49
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.310
<v Speaker 2>athletics and especially athletics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially combat athletics,</v>

50
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you're going to have some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a long and successful fruitful</v>

51
00:02:17.951 --> 00:02:21.850
<v Speaker 2>career by throwing your bones and</v>
<v Speaker 2>another person trying to separate</v>

52
00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:26.710
<v Speaker 2>themselves from their consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's quite ridiculous because just the</v>

53
00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:31.711
<v Speaker 2>very act of doing it in preparing for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that very active to the amount of damage</v>

54
00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:35.560
<v Speaker 2>that your body and your brain even</v>
<v Speaker 2>endures is.</v>

55
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 2>But we have this idea in our heads that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

56
00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:41.390
<v Speaker 2>a guy has to be an undefeated champion</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

57
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.630
<v Speaker 2>my son's going to be a champion someday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

58
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.760
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're really lucky,</v>

59
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:48.070
<v Speaker 2>your son won't be a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're really lucky,</v>

60
00:02:48.071 --> 00:02:52.780
<v Speaker 2>your son will learn the valuable lessons</v>
<v Speaker 2>of martial arts as far as like character</v>

61
00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:57.010
<v Speaker 2>development and the as far as your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to overcome what seemed to be</v>

62
00:02:57.011 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 2>unsurmountable obstacle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to become a champion,</v>

63
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 2>you have to be a crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 2>You have to be crazy person who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with nothing but that and that</v>

65
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 2>will take over your life.</v>

66
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I feel like having worked Avi</v>

67
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.320
<v Speaker 4>obviously with people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

68
00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:14.690
<v Speaker 4>shadowed them and recognizing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>mindset.</v>

69
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.820
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

70
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.050
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

71
00:03:18.051 --> 00:03:20.270
<v Speaker 4>and I find too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's just some point at which</v>

72
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 4>like there's some gifts that are just</v>
<v Speaker 4>bestowed by genetics or something and it</v>

73
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:28.910
<v Speaker 4>didn't matter how hard you work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to quite get to that.</v>

74
00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:33.911
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that level that separates the real</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you won't know that until you hit</v>

75
00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:35.001
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

76
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:37.400
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to know that wall until</v>
<v Speaker 4>you run into it.</v>

77
00:03:37.401 --> 00:03:40.430
<v Speaker 4>And I feel like for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I was talking to one guy,</v>

78
00:03:40.431 --> 00:03:42.680
<v Speaker 4>just a guy at the gym and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

79
00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:44.960
<v Speaker 4>he said something more or less like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>best that he,</v>

80
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.140
<v Speaker 4>he ever felt in a fight was when he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>up against someone he knew was better</v>

81
00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:48.974
<v Speaker 4>than him.</v>

82
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.740
<v Speaker 4>And he knew he was going to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if they fought a hundred times,</v>

83
00:03:51.741 --> 00:03:55.340
<v Speaker 4>he'd lose a hundred times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he packed guy,</v>

84
00:03:55.341 --> 00:03:57.410
<v Speaker 4>he made that guy see something about</v>
<v Speaker 4>himself.</v>

85
00:03:57.411 --> 00:04:00.320
<v Speaker 4>He got that close to him that the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys sorta recognize.</v>

86
00:04:00.321 --> 00:04:03.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm a frail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made out of the same crumbling stuff</v>

87
00:04:03.111 --> 00:04:04.520
<v Speaker 4>that he's made out of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

88
00:04:04.521 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of pierce that teflon armor that,</v>

89
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:09.560
<v Speaker 4>that I think some fighters carry around</v>
<v Speaker 4>with themselves and he's like,</v>

90
00:04:09.561 --> 00:04:10.790
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all I could do.</v>

91
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.310
<v Speaker 4>That for me is the victory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still lost.</v>

92
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.880
<v Speaker 4>But I made that guide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>discover something about himself that he</v>

93
00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:19.760
<v Speaker 4>hadn't discovered up until that point</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he'd never been tested to the</v>

94
00:04:19.761 --> 00:04:22.280
<v Speaker 4>point that I got to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was not able to test them.</v>

95
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.890
<v Speaker 4>And I thought that's another part about</v>
<v Speaker 4>just being,</v>

96
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.190
<v Speaker 4>recognizing what you're able to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

97
00:04:28.191 --> 00:04:30.290
<v Speaker 4>and it may not be beating them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's you,</v>

98
00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:32.330
<v Speaker 4>you find some other measure of success</v>

99
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.153
<v Speaker 5>you</v>

100
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

101
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:40.831
<v Speaker 2>you being a veteran and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you being unabashed in your love for</v>

<v Speaker 2>soldiers and your respect for your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

103
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 2>your fellow military members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you got on top of that cage and</v>

104
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.061
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

105
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 2>they were all cheering and you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling out to all those people that you</v>

106
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 2>loved them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is all off camera man.</v>

107
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 2>We had cut to commercial and you're on</v>
<v Speaker 2>top of the cage and you're just yelling</v>

108
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:01.360
<v Speaker 2>and all those people let them know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you love them.</v>

109
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.730
<v Speaker 2>That's some intense intense shit.</v>

110
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Overwhelming emotional near shutdown.</v>

111
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm walking out to the cage and I see</v>

112
00:05:10.431 --> 00:05:12.110
<v Speaker 5>this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he flies for the one 60th,</v>

113
00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:14.840
<v Speaker 5>which is like the special forces wing of</v>
<v Speaker 5>aviation.</v>

114
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.370
<v Speaker 5>The last time I saw that dude was us</v>
<v Speaker 5>handing him my shot buddy.</v>

115
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.793
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

116
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.490
<v Speaker 5>it's a big thing in special forces</v>
<v Speaker 5>community.</v>

117
00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:23.241
<v Speaker 5>We're real tight.</v>
