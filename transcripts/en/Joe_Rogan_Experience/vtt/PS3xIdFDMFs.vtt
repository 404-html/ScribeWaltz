00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.720

<v Speaker 2>You have to be selfish.</v>

23
00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:44.440
<v Speaker 2>You have to be strong enough to go in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and order Vegan food.</v>

24
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.180

26
00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:52.531

<v Speaker 2>more of those places that are opening </v>

27
00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:55.501
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Mcdonald's is going to offer a Kale </v>

<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>

29
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.360

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

30
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Speaker 2>something's working well.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Kale if you want it to,</v>

36
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.590
<v Speaker 2>but why would they put yogurt in it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it makes it a smoother start.</v>

37
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Starbucks makes us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

38
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 2>you know the market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The market will dictate it if people </v>

39
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.101
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started like when you talk about </v>

40
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:26.410
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theories with evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations,</v>

41
00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:28.540
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're responding to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>people want.</v>

42
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.770
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

43
00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:31.630
<v Speaker 2>People want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to start making it.</v>

44
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole conspiracy with really </v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty television shows to like people </v>

45
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 2>like men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to make us dumb.</v>

46
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Already dumb like you have to do is look</v>

47
00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:47.071
<v Speaker 2>at the ratings and see what people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually watching it and they're </v>

48
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:47.071
<v Speaker 2>responding to that.</v>

49
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are tired.</v>

50
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.180
<v Speaker 2>They get home from work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're exhausted.</v>

51
00:01:49.181 --> 00:01:51.520
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to watch cosmos or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them do.</v>

52
00:01:51.521 --> 00:01:53.320
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people just want to,</v>

53
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 2>they just want to zone out and watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>honey booboo or I don't think that's </v>

54
00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.260
<v Speaker 2>right anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always a new one.</v>

55
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we uh,</v>

56
00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:02.990
<v Speaker 2>we got rid of our TVS.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

57
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.800
<v Speaker 2>like are you like a year ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But believe me,</v>

58
00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:08.620
<v Speaker 2>I did not want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was not my idea.</v>

59
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 2>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was quite vociferous in opposing that </v>

60
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.680
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my wife's idea.</v>

61
00:02:14.681 --> 00:02:17.530
<v Speaker 2>But actually it's just like anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else you adjust to it.</v>

62
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:22.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean I still watch Netflix and I watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shows I like to watch and now I </v>

63
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:22.531
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't miss it.</v>

64
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 2>And I have total,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I've been traveling a lot and </v>

65
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in hotel rooms,</v>

66
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.270
<v Speaker 2>he turned the TV on and I have a zero </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerance policy for commercials now.</v>

67
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

68
00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:36.550
<v Speaker 2>and I just turned the TV off and go back</v>
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>

69
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>commercials are fucking brutal.</v>

70
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Whoever invented the idea of stopping a </v>
<v Speaker 2>show every 15 minutes for three minutes </v>

71
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:45.760
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the hell it is for </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercials.</v>

72
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.170
<v Speaker 2>That's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

73
00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:50.050
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy how you acclimate to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because as a kid,</v>

74
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about how many hours of your life,</v>

75
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just basically watching </v>

76
00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.330
<v Speaker 2>commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

77
00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.330
<v Speaker 2>you know what happened though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dvrs,</v>

78
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 2>dvrs made commercials really stupid.</v>

79
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 3>That's still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're about the same age,</v>

80
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:06.781
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's still a recent development in </v>

81
00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:06.781
<v Speaker 3>our life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

82
00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 3>most of our formative years was terrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>television commercials.</v>

83
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got my first vo in the early two </v>

84
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.801
<v Speaker 3>thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a standalone unit that </v>

85
00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 3>hooked up to direct TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like,</v>

86
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 3>I want to say like 2003 or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

87
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:22.710
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is amazing.</v>

88
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 3>You can pause the TV now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can pause it and go take a leak.</v>

89
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.460
<v Speaker 3>You could record things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could find search things and have </v>

90
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 3>them on a schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I fucking.</v>

91
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.150
<v Speaker 3>I had probably 10 vcrs in my life and </v>
<v Speaker 3>never figured out how to record one of </v>

92
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 3>those pitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This flashing 12:00,</v>

93
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.460
<v Speaker 3>I'd never scheduled one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had one of them scheduled,</v>

94
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 3>unlike anybody figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people must have.</v>

95
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.880
<v Speaker 4>It's cool how it's changing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

96
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to see how,</v>

97
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 4>how you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on with Netflix and Amazon </v>

98
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 4>and all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

99
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.820
<v Speaker 4>and most recently what Tim Ferriss has </v>
<v Speaker 4>done with his show,</v>

100
00:03:59.821 --> 00:04:02.430
<v Speaker 4>have you followed that at all?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which was so,</v>

101
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.300
<v Speaker 4>so tim had a show called the Tim Ferriss</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiment in an era on.</v>

102
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.280
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

103
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

104
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.030
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

105
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.820
<v Speaker 4>it was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another channel that was part of the CNN</v>

106
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.270
<v Speaker 4>headline news or it wasn't headline news</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it was something like that.</v>

107
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.380
<v Speaker 4>It went under.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

108
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:21.381
<v Speaker 4>And so his show was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many episodes had </v>

109
00:04:21.381 --> 00:04:21.990
<v Speaker 4>aired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but certainly not the entire 13,</v>

110
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the season.</v>

111
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.960
<v Speaker 4>And then it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

112
00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:26.790
<v Speaker 4>how it is an entertainment like you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>just done,</v>

113
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.140
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They own the show.</v>

114
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.410
<v Speaker 4>And even though they were all taped and </v>
<v Speaker 4>locked in and completed,</v>

115
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.700
<v Speaker 4>nobody had seen them and somehow he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to get,</v>

116
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.860
<v Speaker 4>get his show back and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

117
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.660
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

118
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 4>through loitering or what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

119
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.670
<v Speaker 4>bought the rights back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got his show and cut a deal with itunes </v>

120
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.361
<v Speaker 4>and it's premiered on itunes this past </v>
<v Speaker 4>week and I think it's like the top </v>

121
00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:52.080
<v Speaker 4>ranked TV show on itunes</v>

122
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.040
<v Speaker 3>now you can watch the TV show rankings </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

123
00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:58.110
<v Speaker 3>or just like their podcast rankings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

124
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows how the,</v>

125
00:04:59.181 --> 00:05:01.280
<v Speaker 3>it knows that algorithm works well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

126
00:05:01.281 --> 00:05:03.500
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely not based on the number </v>
<v Speaker 3>of downloads.</v>

127
00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:04.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely not.</v>

128
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.410
<v Speaker 3>It's based on new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it,</v>

129
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:10.790
<v Speaker 3>it knew it takes precedent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new subscribers and,</v>

130
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.980
<v Speaker 3>and also uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comments.</v>

131
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 3>So like Chelsea Peretti had the number </v>
<v Speaker 3>one podcast in the country and she </v>

132
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.730
<v Speaker 3>hadn't even released an episode yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

133
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.870
<v Speaker 3>So zero had been downloaded and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>also put subscribed.</v>

134
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.570
<v Speaker 4>They overinflate new shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone,</v>

135
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.590
<v Speaker 4>somebody premiers a show with one or two</v>
<v Speaker 4>episodes that it's like super high up </v>

136
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 4>for awhile before it settles into where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it should be.</v>

137
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 3>I think that's good because it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep anybody from downloading other </v>

138
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.441
<v Speaker 3>shows that are already popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it does give new shows like a </v>

139
00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 3>window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

140
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.730
<v Speaker 3>you'll see people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm number one,</v>

141
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.040
<v Speaker 3>like you'll see like these bright like </v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

142
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Like do you know what that means?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

143
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.000
<v Speaker 3>What are your numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many downloads?</v>

144
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.980
<v Speaker 3>EA?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely not number one there.</v>

145
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.310
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rankings is weird.</v>

146
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 3>It was all over the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my show</v>

147
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.400
<v Speaker 5>this week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

148
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 5>it's got a banner on the top carousel of</v>
<v Speaker 5>Itunes,</v>

149
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:08.591
<v Speaker 5>on the itunes homepage for podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So my numbers went way up this week and </v>

150
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 5>overall rankings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know that's not real.</v>

151
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll settle back down and then we will.</v>

152
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:15.780
<v Speaker 5>But it won't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

153
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 5>it will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it'll build,</v>

154
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember when we first started doing </v>

155
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.210
<v Speaker 5>this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what our downloads were.</v>

156
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 5>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were nothing though.</v>

157
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.240
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

158
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 5>a few thousand here or there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then one day it was like,</v>

159
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:33.071
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're getting a million downloads a </v>

160
00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:33.071
<v Speaker 5>month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

161
00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 5>A million.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now it's somewhere around 14 </v>

162
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 5>million.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it really?</v>

163
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's your,</v>

164
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 5>what's your average download per show?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can you talk about that ends?</v>

165
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 5>It depends on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's all the different things.</v>

166
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:47.291
<v Speaker 5>There's Itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then there's the raw mp3 that you can </v>

167
00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:47.300
<v Speaker 5>download there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stitcher,</v>

168
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 5>which is really hard to track.</v>

169
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't know what's going on.</v>

170
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 5>Stitcher only takes one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll give you numbers,</v>

171
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:57.341
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chase it down to what they do is </v>

172
00:06:57.341 --> 00:06:59.810
<v Speaker 5>stitcher is an application for cell </v>
<v Speaker 5>phones that allows,</v>

173
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:04.811
<v Speaker 5>they take a podcast and they below are </v>
<v Speaker 5>the bit rate and make it a much smaller </v>

174
00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 5>file and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they only download one episode,</v>

175
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 5>but then it gets distributed through </v>
<v Speaker 5>their system,</v>

176
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many times.</v>

177
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.590
<v Speaker 5>So then there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then there's Ustream,</v>

178
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 5>which is a few thousand usually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

179
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.680
<v Speaker 5>and then there's youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is tens if not hundreds of </v>

180
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:23.990
<v Speaker 5>thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 5>usually hundreds of thousands.</v>

181
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

182
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.990
<v Speaker 5>it's never tens of thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

183
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.350
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

184
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.380
<v Speaker 5>vimeo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So altogether it's usually around a </v>

185
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.560
<v Speaker 5>billion an episode depending on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>episode.</v>

186
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

187
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.190
<v Speaker 5>It could be more crazy numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

188
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 5>powerful jewelry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

189
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 5>it's just a number thing.</v>

190
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.530
<v Speaker 5>Just you keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have interesting people like rich roll.</v>

191
00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 5>It isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gentlemen,</v>

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 5>have interesting people on have funny </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversations,</v>

193
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 5>fun conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and just keep doing it and it built.</v>

194
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.530
<v Speaker 5>I just listened to your episode with Sam</v>
<v Speaker 5>Harris from the other day and it's just </v>

195
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.160
<v Speaker 5>he.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy is captivating.</v>

196
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's an interesting dude.</v>

197
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 5>He's a very intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very cool guy.</v>

198
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.700
<v Speaker 5>I want to get him together with Abby </v>
<v Speaker 5>Martin though.</v>

199
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.620
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's got down the same room.</v>

200
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:12.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure your phone rang from her after </v>
<v Speaker 5>that show.</v>

201
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.500
<v Speaker 5>I got a few text messages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We went back and forth.</v>

202
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.560
<v Speaker 5>She's my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm very good friends with her and I'm </v>

203
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:20.560
<v Speaker 5>good friends with Sam too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like both of them.</v>

204
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.890
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sam's got a next level brain.</v>

205
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's very smart.</v>

206
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:27.941
<v Speaker 5>Whether you agree with him or not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he has an incredible acuity to present </v>

207
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:33.101
<v Speaker 5>an argument and support it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>communicate it in a very clear and calm </v>

208
00:08:33.101 --> 00:08:33.470
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

209
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.630
<v Speaker 5>He's also very honest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

210
00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:36.000
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

211
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.680
<v Speaker 5>if he's communicating and argument he is</v>
<v Speaker 5>not doing it to be deceptive.</v>

212
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:45.010
<v Speaker 5>These are his actual feelings and </v>
<v Speaker 5>thoughts and agree with them or not </v>

213
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 5>agreeing with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is his point of view and uh,</v>

214
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:46.430
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as hard as,</v>

215
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

216
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:48.910
<v Speaker 5>I respect both of them very much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

217
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.740
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in the middle between both as well.</v>

218
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm not necessarily 100 percent her </v>
<v Speaker 5>side.</v>

219
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm not necessarily hundred percent his </v>
<v Speaker 5>side.</v>

220
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.830
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

221
00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

222
00:08:58.711 --> 00:08:59.670
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

223
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:02.550
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about death and war and </v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

224
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.600
<v Speaker 5>anytime you can find any way to minimize</v>
<v Speaker 5>or trivialize that,</v>

225
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 5>it's easily open for argument,</v>
<v Speaker 5>open for criticism.</v>

226
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 5>So that's where I see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see her point of view,</v>

227
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:18.350
<v Speaker 5>but I also see his point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot of fucking crazy people in </v>

228
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.350
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a awful,</v>

229
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.350
<v Speaker 5>terrible people.</v>

230
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.150
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of really dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideologies that are being passed around </v>

231
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:24.210
<v Speaker 5>and have been passed around for a long </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

232
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 5>And the people that are embedded in </v>
<v Speaker 5>these ideologies are married to them.</v>

233
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:29.890
<v Speaker 5>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very committed to it.</v>

234
00:09:29.891 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see his point of view.</v>

235
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 5>He knows what he's talking about and to </v>
<v Speaker 5>shade.</v>

236
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:35.160
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy,</v>

237
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

238
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Speaker 5>a couple things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

239
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.710
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm always impressed with how you kind </v>

240
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.901
<v Speaker 5>of navigate the treacherous waters of </v>
<v Speaker 5>having guests on that you may disagree </v>

241
00:09:44.901 --> 00:09:45.720
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which may beat me today,</v>

242
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:47.070
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

243
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:52.071
<v Speaker 5>sort of yell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll have people with different point </v>

244
00:09:52.071 --> 00:09:52.071
<v Speaker 5>of view,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes extreme,</v>

245
00:09:52.071 --> 00:09:52.071
<v Speaker 5>sometimes not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

246
00:09:52.071 --> 00:09:56.861
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the way that you kind of have to </v>

247
00:09:56.861 --> 00:09:56.861
<v Speaker 5>gracefully like as a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's myself,</v>

248
00:09:56.861 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 5>that's always a challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

249
00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.660
<v Speaker 5>like how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

250
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.320
<v Speaker 5>have a respectful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>engaging conversation,</v>

251
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.360
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also make sure that you're asking </v>

252
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 5>the right questions so that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>just people pleasing.</v>

253
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

254
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 5>with disagreeing with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

255
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.190
<v Speaker 5>and I don't think there's anything wrong</v>
<v Speaker 5>with having a pleasant conversation with</v>

256
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:19.191
<v Speaker 5>someone whose views you don't share.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think two people can be diametrically </v>

257
00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:22.140
<v Speaker 5>opposed on certain issues,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but still be nice to each other.</v>

258
00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:23.400
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>with that.</v>

259
00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:28.401
<v Speaker 5>And I think when I talked to someone who</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't share my opinions or has </v>

260
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.740
<v Speaker 5>differing opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried to relax whatever part of me </v>

261
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:37.650
<v Speaker 5>wants to argue with that and just try to</v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out what is it,</v>

262
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.170
<v Speaker 5>where they come in from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

263
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:44.250
<v Speaker 5>where's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's their point of view based on is </v>

264
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:44.250
<v Speaker 5>it logical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it emotional,</v>

265
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.270
<v Speaker 5>is it objective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it non,</v>

266
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.510
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where were they at,</v>

267
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.240
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And also I like to play,</v>

268
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.400
<v Speaker 5>like sometimes people say you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you asked this,</v>

269
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.600
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes I'll ask people things </v>

270
00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.070
<v Speaker 5>that I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even believe what I'm saying,</v>

271
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:04.100
<v Speaker 5>what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I'm trying to do is either play </v>

272
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.531
<v Speaker 5>devil's advocate or argue the </v>
<v Speaker 5>counterpoint just to try to figure out </v>

273
00:11:06.531 --> 00:11:09.300
<v Speaker 5>where they're at and try to cover all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the bases.</v>

274
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.580
<v Speaker 5>Because especially when it comes to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>controversial issue,</v>

275
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want,</v>

276
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.650
<v Speaker 5>you want to explore not just where a </v>
<v Speaker 5>person's at,</v>

277
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.420
<v Speaker 5>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they're trying to say,</v>

278
00:11:18.421 --> 00:11:20.760
<v Speaker 5>but how did they come to that </v>
<v Speaker 5>conclusion?</v>

279
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.070
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in the case of Sam,</v>

280
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's traveled extensively.</v>

281
00:11:24.961 --> 00:11:27.510
<v Speaker 5>He has firsthand experience with all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these kinds of people.</v>

282
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.900
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he has a basis from where,</v>

283
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for where he's coming from.</v>

284
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.640
<v Speaker 5>A,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was actually a funny story about him.</v>

285
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.290
<v Speaker 5>I've never met him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know him,</v>

286
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:42.350
<v Speaker 5>but we were classmates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were in the same freshman class in </v>

287
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.020
<v Speaker 5>college at Stanford and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't,</v>

288
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:50.060
<v Speaker 5>like I said I don't know him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we have mutual friends in common so </v>

289
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.661
<v Speaker 5>a couple of guys that I'm close with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he's still close with and I was </v>

290
00:11:53.661 --> 00:11:56.931
<v Speaker 5>talking to one of them recently and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>just said we were talking about Sam </v>

291
00:11:56.931 --> 00:12:00.091
<v Speaker 5>because he's blown up and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere and he's so insight guy </v>

292
00:12:00.091 --> 00:12:00.091
<v Speaker 5>straighten out.</v>

293
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was telling me that in some freshmen,</v>

294
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it was a freshman </v>
<v Speaker 5>English class or something like that,</v>

295
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:07.450
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he,</v>

296
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.600
<v Speaker 5>that Sam just distinguished himself </v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately,</v>

297
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:15.601
<v Speaker 5>like by challenging the professor and </v>
<v Speaker 5>just everybody knew that he was on a </v>

298
00:12:15.601 --> 00:12:19.090
<v Speaker 5>nother level intellectually at a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at a young age.</v>

299
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:24.510
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's got to be very difficult if you're </v>

300
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.881
<v Speaker 5>in college and you're taking classes </v>
<v Speaker 5>from a person that you think is a dumb </v>

301
00:12:26.881 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 5>ass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which does happen.</v>

302
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:28.600
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

303
00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had it happen in college.</v>

304
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 5>I can clearly remember.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forgot what class it was in,</v>

305
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.610
<v Speaker 5>but I can clearly remember going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

306
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:42.750
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well now I have to just think only of </v>

307
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:42.750
<v Speaker 5>the information,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

308
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 5>the actual numbers and the data that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>being presented in this class and ignore</v>

309
00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:49.060
<v Speaker 5>this person's opinion because there are </v>
<v Speaker 5>a fucking idiot.</v>

310
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:54.270
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was either a philosophy </v>

311
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:54.270
<v Speaker 5>class or a psychology class.</v>

312
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember the exact circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I remember thinking like,</v>

313
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.120
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a real issue.</v>

314
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:03.390
<v Speaker 5>And then as I got older and I started </v>
<v Speaker 5>paying attention to some of the things </v>

315
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.880
<v Speaker 5>that get taught in school and some of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the like very rigid ideologies.</v>

316
00:13:06.881 --> 00:13:11.740
<v Speaker 5>It's some people especially like really </v>
<v Speaker 5>super lefties like to impose on students</v>

317
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:14.040
<v Speaker 5>and some of the ideas they tried to </v>
<v Speaker 5>impose on students are very.</v>

318
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.060
<v Speaker 5>It's a very subjective ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

319
00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:18.310
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very much personal opinions.</v>

320
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:23.311
<v Speaker 5>They get stuffed into kids' heads and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then it becomes an issue of whether or </v>

321
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:26.560
<v Speaker 5>not you know whether or not you want </v>
<v Speaker 5>that in your head.</v>

322
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:27.440
<v Speaker 5>Whether or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

323
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.880
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get an a in this class </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you disagree with this guy,</v>

324
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
<v Speaker 5>but still present good arguments or </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have to go along with </v>

325
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.451
<v Speaker 5>the way this person is trying to portray</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world in order to be graded </v>

326
00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:39.451
<v Speaker 5>accordingly.</v>

327
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:44.940
<v Speaker 5>I don't think critical thought is really</v>
<v Speaker 5>taught to the extent that it should be </v>

328
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.020
<v Speaker 5>in young people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

329
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:49.720
<v Speaker 5>we're on this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our education system is about,</v>

330
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting through as much information as </v>

331
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:54.780
<v Speaker 5>possible and standardized testing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

332
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.660
<v Speaker 5>getting good grades and all that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing and you know,</v>

333
00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:02.830
<v Speaker 5>the idea that you should be questioning </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ideas that are presented to you is </v>

334
00:14:02.921 --> 00:14:07.921
<v Speaker 5>really not something that is part of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that world to the extent that I think it</v>

335
00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:09.300
<v Speaker 5>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

336
00:14:09.301 --> 00:14:12.880
<v Speaker 5>And I also think that there's very </v>
<v Speaker 5>little being taught,</v>

337
00:14:12.881 --> 00:14:17.881
<v Speaker 5>especially at a high school level of how</v>
<v Speaker 5>to think and not just like,</v>

338
00:14:18.311 --> 00:14:21.220
<v Speaker 5>this is mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the way you calculate things.</v>

339
00:14:21.221 --> 00:14:26.221
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are the facts of history that </v>

340
00:14:26.221 --> 00:14:28.261
<v Speaker 5>we're aware of instead of how do you </v>
<v Speaker 5>deal with problems,</v>

341
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.820
<v Speaker 5>how do you address interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationships?</v>

342
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.820
<v Speaker 5>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you look at yourself objectives?</v>

343
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:43.050
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever step back and try to look at</v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself the way maybe someone else </v>

344
00:14:43.721 --> 00:14:48.721
<v Speaker 5>would and judge yourself and your own </v>
<v Speaker 5>actions instead of protecting yourself </v>

345
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:53.311
<v Speaker 5>with your ego and all those things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people do like almost naturally to </v>

346
00:14:53.311 --> 00:14:55.040
<v Speaker 5>protect themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really wind up being traps.</v>

347
00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:00.330
<v Speaker 5>It really wind up fucking you up and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to kind of clean up that mess as </v>

348
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:00.500
<v Speaker 5>you get older.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

349
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:05.501
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess that's supposed to be on the </v>

350
00:15:05.501 --> 00:15:05.660
<v Speaker 5>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

351
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.900
<v Speaker 5>They don't do it either like life </v>
<v Speaker 5>skills.</v>

352
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:12.710
<v Speaker 5>What about just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

353
00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:15.080
<v Speaker 5>learning how to navigate this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>world that we're living in,</v>

354
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about learning how to eat.</v>

355
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.590
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the most important thing,</v>

356
00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:19.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a parents,</v>

357
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:24.750
<v Speaker 5>it's like I want my kids to be excited </v>
<v Speaker 5>about life and to be excited about </v>

358
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:29.381
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to figure out a way to be passionate </v>

359
00:15:29.381 --> 00:15:29.381
<v Speaker 5>about something because if they have </v>
<v Speaker 5>that motor,</v>

360
00:15:29.381 --> 00:15:32.420
<v Speaker 5>that drive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is half the game right there.</v>

361
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.230
<v Speaker 5>And then also to have that ability to </v>
<v Speaker 5>critically,</v>

362
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:41.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to want to learn the desire to learn as </v>

363
00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:41.260
<v Speaker 5>much more important than whatever you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>learning.</v>

364
00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how do you make your kid enthusiastic</v>

365
00:15:44.001 --> 00:15:49.001
<v Speaker 5>about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially when they're getting beaten </v>

366
00:15:49.001 --> 00:15:51.221
<v Speaker 5>down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to find whatever it is that </v>

367
00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:51.221
<v Speaker 5>they're drawn to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

368
00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:55.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you expose them to a lot of things </v>

369
00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.031
<v Speaker 5>and then when they find something that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they kind of gravitate towards your job </v>

370
00:15:58.031 --> 00:15:58.310
<v Speaker 5>is to support that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At least that's how I see it.</v>

371
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:03.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then give them the opportunity to </v>

372
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.101
<v Speaker 5>switch gears to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember when I was a kid I would be </v>

373
00:16:06.101 --> 00:16:09.491
<v Speaker 5>into a lot of different things and my </v>
<v Speaker 5>parents would always be like super </v>

374
00:16:09.491 --> 00:16:09.980
<v Speaker 5>resistant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I got into something else,</v>

375
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.110
<v Speaker 5>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well what about the other thing that you</v>

376
00:16:12.111 --> 00:16:12.880
<v Speaker 5>do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I'm like,</v>

377
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.150
<v Speaker 5>well I want to do this now.</v>

378
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.220
<v Speaker 5>Stop fucking with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What were you into?</v>

379
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.450
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>initially I was really into art.</v>

380
00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.390
<v Speaker 5>You're crazy drawer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I used to do.</v>

381
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the all day long.</v>

382
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.540
<v Speaker 5>When I was really young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was A.</v>

383
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:31.580
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to be a comic book illustrator,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I used to draw a lot and then um,</v>

384
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.690
<v Speaker 5>when I was in my teenage years I </v>
<v Speaker 5>discovered martial arts and that's all I</v>

385
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:37.460
<v Speaker 5>wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And my parents were like,</v>

386
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:38.720
<v Speaker 5>why do you want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

387
00:16:38.721 --> 00:16:40.430
<v Speaker 5>why are you doing that when you used to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do this?</v>

388
00:16:40.431 --> 00:16:42.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's what I liked.</v>

389
00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 5>Now can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just liked it.</v>

390
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:49.121
<v Speaker 5>And they said that presupposes that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to make a choice between two </v>

391
00:16:49.121 --> 00:16:52.361
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why do you have to define yourself </v>

392
00:16:52.361 --> 00:16:52.361
<v Speaker 5>by one of those?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

393
00:16:52.361 --> 00:16:53.090
<v Speaker 5>why couldn't you be my dad?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>

394
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.820
<v Speaker 5>Where were you when my mom was hot?</v>

395
00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's,</v>

396
00:16:59.181 --> 00:17:00.560
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

397
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.410
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of it is people,</v>

398
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're raising their kids,</v>

399
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:10.190
<v Speaker 5>they just want the best for their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just maybe don't have the best </v>

400
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:10.700
<v Speaker 5>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

401
00:17:10.701 --> 00:17:13.360
<v Speaker 5>they don't necessarily know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's also like,</v>

402
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.820
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was born in 1967,</v>

403
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.310
<v Speaker 5>so my parents were basically cave </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

404
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.050
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's be realistic,</v>

405
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.150
<v Speaker 5>like people that were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're,</v>

406
00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:25.580
<v Speaker 5>if you're born in [inaudible] 67,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that means your parents were.</v>

407
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.620
<v Speaker 5>My parents were born in [inaudible] 47,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

408
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.500
<v Speaker 5>My mom was like 20 when she had me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So w 1947.</v>

409
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:35.000
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking world war two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

410
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.690
<v Speaker 5>that means that her parents were born </v>
<v Speaker 5>during World War One.</v>

411
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:43.990
<v Speaker 5>My,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her parents came over on the boat from </v>

412
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:43.990
<v Speaker 5>Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

413
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.710
<v Speaker 5>they're savages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're basically,</v>

414
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.910
<v Speaker 5>they might as well be Magellan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

415
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.410
<v Speaker 5>Well there too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

416
00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 5>I was born in [inaudible] 66,</v>

417
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.070
<v Speaker 4>so same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same basic idea.</v>

418
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.650
<v Speaker 4>My parents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

419
00:17:54.651 --> 00:17:59.651
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're too old to have been part of </v>

420
00:17:59.651 --> 00:17:59.651
<v Speaker 4>kind of sixties subculture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

421
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.820
<v Speaker 4>so they kind of missed that part but too</v>
<v Speaker 4>young to kind of be seventies vibe also.</v>

422
00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:10.680
<v Speaker 4>So there's sort of a weird like light </v>
<v Speaker 4>dusting of mad men era,</v>

423
00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're great people.</v>

424
00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 4>I love my parents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

425
00:18:14.701 --> 00:18:15.270
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

426
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.360
<v Speaker 4>their fans and they did the best job </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they could raising me and work </v>

427
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:20.360
<v Speaker 4>clothes and all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

428
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:21.870
<v Speaker 4>but they live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

429
00:18:21.871 --> 00:18:23.280
<v Speaker 4>they don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a,</v>

430
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.820
<v Speaker 4>they have a challenge trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand like what I'm doing now.</v>

431
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.930
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They try.</v>

432
00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

433
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.480
<v Speaker 4>and they're happy that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm happy,</v>

434
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.800
<v Speaker 4>but it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

435
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:34.440
<v Speaker 4>they're coming from a generation where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

436
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.980
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in a really education focused </v>

437
00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.381
<v Speaker 4>household and I tried to my best to live</v>
<v Speaker 4>up to that and to some extent I </v>

438
00:18:42.381 --> 00:18:42.381
<v Speaker 4>succeeded at that.</v>

439
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.410
<v Speaker 4>But the whole idea was premised on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>myth of the American dream,</v>

440
00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>study hard,</v>

441
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.300
<v Speaker 4>get into the best school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get into the best graduate school,</v>

442
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.770
<v Speaker 4>get the best job you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

443
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.860
<v Speaker 4>work hard and like do as you're told and</v>
<v Speaker 4>ascend the ladder and the implicit </v>

444
00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:58.500
<v Speaker 4>promise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

445
00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.870
<v Speaker 4>at the end of that rainbow of course is </v>
<v Speaker 4>not only,</v>

446
00:19:00.871 --> 00:19:05.871
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of security and prosperity but </v>

447
00:19:05.871 --> 00:19:05.871
<v Speaker 4>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

448
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.300
<v Speaker 4>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I chased that without ever really </v>

449
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.910
<v Speaker 4>without those critical thinking skills </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I never really intuited that I </v>

450
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:18.261
<v Speaker 4>was just so focused on the prize and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>very disciplined and determined and but </v>

451
00:19:19.231 --> 00:19:24.231
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't able to step outside the box </v>
<v Speaker 4>and look at it analytically in </v>

452
00:19:24.231 --> 00:19:25.050
<v Speaker 4>comparison to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

453
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.360
<v Speaker 4>what would be best for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I never said,</v>

454
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:28.590
<v Speaker 4>what do I want?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just,</v>

455
00:19:28.591 --> 00:19:30.750
<v Speaker 4>this is what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is how you get ahead.</v>

456
00:19:30.751 --> 00:19:32.160
<v Speaker 4>This is how you have a good life.</v>

457
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.920
<v Speaker 3>I think there's also their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

458
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.320
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely not their fault.</v>

459
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:41.350
<v Speaker 3>The amount of information that they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>available to them back then comparison </v>

460
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.740
<v Speaker 3>to what we have today is unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 3>different now.</v>

461
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:48.960
<v Speaker 3>There's so much more information now and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's also a very.</v>

462
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.980
<v Speaker 3>There's a real lack of understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the landscape of the race you're in.</v>

463
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.380
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody wants to think of it as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>race is the rat race.</v>

464
00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:03.770
<v Speaker 3>But if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could get an aerial view of the </v>

465
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.741
<v Speaker 3>actual race from birth to death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the time you're born to the time </v>

466
00:20:06.741 --> 00:20:10.911
<v Speaker 3>you leave this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And look at it as like you're looking </v>

467
00:20:10.911 --> 00:20:12.090
<v Speaker 3>into formula one race track and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could actually see the course.</v>

468
00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:14.010
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fucking Jesus Christ.</v>

469
00:20:14.011 --> 00:20:16.470
<v Speaker 3>What am I doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wasting all my time doing shit.</v>

470
00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:18.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Race is not very long.</v>

471
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.900
<v Speaker 3>This race is going to end like this is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

472
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:27.020
<v Speaker 3>I thought it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought there was like a happiness </v>

473
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.851
<v Speaker 3>truck somewhere along the line that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to refuel with and change my </v>

474
00:20:28.851 --> 00:20:29.430
<v Speaker 3>tires when I get my phd.</v>

475
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:34.490
<v Speaker 4>It's the idea that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>arrive at some point or that you're </v>

476
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.450
<v Speaker 4>going to land in this destination that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is called success or happiness.</v>

477
00:20:36.451 --> 00:20:39.450
<v Speaker 4>And when you get to our age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you realize that that's just.</v>

478
00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.920
<v Speaker 4>That's an illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

479
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.980
<v Speaker 4>It just continues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you start to think about what your </v>

480
00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.041
<v Speaker 4>life means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you stand for and what is your </v>

481
00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:49.041
<v Speaker 4>legacy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

482
00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:49.270
<v Speaker 4>we're approaching 50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

483
00:20:49.271 --> 00:20:52.240
<v Speaker 4>what do you know if I die today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was,</v>

484
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.670
<v Speaker 4>what did I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did I leave in my wake?</v>

485
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:55.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even that,</v>

486
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.420
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom line is whatever you leave,</v>

487
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.780
<v Speaker 3>it's not gonna matter because it's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to matter to some people that you know </v>

488
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.080
<v Speaker 3>and they're going to leave to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's going to leave,</v>

489
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.640
<v Speaker 3>but are you enjoying this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you enjoying the moment?</v>

490
00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.820
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's working towards this ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the retirement years,</v>

491
00:21:12.821 --> 00:21:17.821
<v Speaker 3>the golden ears like you're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost dead when those years come like </v>

492
00:21:17.821 --> 00:21:20.200
<v Speaker 3>those little you see those people </v>
<v Speaker 3>holding hands and walking along,</v>

493
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.210
<v Speaker 3>they barely can walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their knees hurt.</v>

494
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.240
<v Speaker 3>They're all fucked up like that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you work for.</v>

495
00:21:25.241 --> 00:21:30.241
<v Speaker 3>You don't work towards this ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>point where you don't do anything </v>

496
00:21:30.241 --> 00:21:33.751
<v Speaker 3>anymore and that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The what you should work towards is </v>

497
00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:37.270
<v Speaker 3>doing what you enjoy doing right now and</v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoying your life right now,</v>

498
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:42.330
<v Speaker 3>enjoying your friends right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoying whatever hobbies you like to </v>

499
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:46.021
<v Speaker 3>pursue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever love affairs and friendships </v>

500
00:21:46.021 --> 00:21:47.950
<v Speaker 3>and all that stuff is what life is.</v>

501
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.510
<v Speaker 3>Life is the moment being in the moment </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we somehow have turned it into this,</v>

502
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:58.360
<v Speaker 3>this weird journey to have a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific point,</v>

503
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.360
<v Speaker 3>specific points of high school </v>
<v Speaker 3>graduation,</v>

504
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:04.540
<v Speaker 3>college graduation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but good job marriage,</v>

505
00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:09.541
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have all these like milestones that </v>

506
00:22:09.541 --> 00:22:12.160
<v Speaker 3>are supposed to impart happiness in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>race and they they're not real.</v>

507
00:22:12.161 --> 00:22:17.161
<v Speaker 3>They're social constructs and we've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've created these social constructs </v>

508
00:22:17.161 --> 00:22:20.491
<v Speaker 3>and we've fed into them and pass them </v>
<v Speaker 3>down from generation to generation </v>

509
00:22:20.491 --> 00:22:22.300
<v Speaker 3>without anybody stepping back and going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

510
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.240
<v Speaker 3>who set this up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who set up?</v>

511
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Who set up graduate school?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who said it?</v>

512
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.860
<v Speaker 3>Who set up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who set up common core?</v>

513
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are these people like,</v>

514
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:32.470
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is,</v>

515
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.740
<v Speaker 3>why is it this way with this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just biological organisms trying </v>

516
00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:42.160
<v Speaker 3>to have as much happiness and good </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling while we're here is we can.</v>

517
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.270
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's</v>

518
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:48.270
<v Speaker 4>changing though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that if you talk to somebody </v>

519
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.241
<v Speaker 4>who's in their twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the idea that you would work a </v>

520
00:22:51.241 --> 00:22:53.770
<v Speaker 4>corporate job and stay in that job for </v>
<v Speaker 4>your career and collect your pension and</v>

521
00:22:53.771 --> 00:22:58.771
<v Speaker 4>then write out your sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies playing golf is a foreign </v>

522
00:22:58.771 --> 00:23:01.360
<v Speaker 4>concept to a young person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas that was the kind of paradigm,</v>

523
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>For our parents' generation and when you</v>

524
00:23:04.241 --> 00:23:09.241
<v Speaker 4>look at the advent of the Internet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what that provides and allows you see </v>

525
00:23:09.241 --> 00:23:13.231
<v Speaker 4>this explosion in lifestyle careers </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you're not wed to a geographic </v>

526
00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:18.391
<v Speaker 4>location.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We live in a kind of subcontractor </v>

527
00:23:18.391 --> 00:23:20.620
<v Speaker 4>economy where people are more project </v>
<v Speaker 4>based than,</v>

528
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:25.680
<v Speaker 4>than you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>working for the big corporation or the </v>

529
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.201
<v Speaker 4>plants and certainly all that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>exists on some level but not to the </v>

530
00:23:28.201 --> 00:23:28.900
<v Speaker 4>extent that it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it used to.</v>

531
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's super interesting and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that allows people to engage in </v>

532
00:23:34.691 --> 00:23:36.820
<v Speaker 4>critical thinking and a new and </v>
<v Speaker 4>different way.</v>

533
00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:41.820
<v Speaker 4>And I think you see young people who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>asking themselves those very questions </v>

534
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:41.820
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do I want to do?</v>

535
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.620
<v Speaker 4>What makes me happy with that can come </v>
<v Speaker 4>entitlement.</v>

536
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:48.110
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I think the millennials </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a get a bad rap for that,</v>

537
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:53.470
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time I think that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>are much more engaged in trying to </v>

538
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.750
<v Speaker 4>grapple with who they are and what it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

539
00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:01.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're passionate about expressing and </v>

540
00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:03.701
<v Speaker 4>then finding a way to tap into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>economy somehow so that they can </v>

541
00:24:03.701 --> 00:24:08.410
<v Speaker 4>contribute and make a living doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that's really cool to </v>

542
00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:08.410
<v Speaker 4>watch unfold.</v>

543
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.480
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that the idea that </v>

544
00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.641
<v Speaker 3>millennials are entitled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think every young kid has a distorted </v>

545
00:24:17.631 --> 00:24:20.390
<v Speaker 3>perception of the world that we live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and in every generation,</v>

546
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.000
<v Speaker 3>probably less so to know they're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

547
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be in some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably not on a podcast,</v>

548
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:26.240
<v Speaker 4>but in some form of media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

549
00:24:26.241 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 4>20 years from now talking about how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

550
00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:33.401
<v Speaker 4>you and I are out to lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the natural order of </v>

551
00:24:33.401 --> 00:24:37.601
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how are priorities and how we raise </v>

552
00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:37.601
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is myopic in some way.</v>

553
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.080
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

554
00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:39.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll fill,</v>

555
00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:44.860
<v Speaker 4>they'll figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll get it better than we're doing </v>

556
00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:44.860
<v Speaker 4>it well with the acceleration of </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>

557
00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:45.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows where things are going to be.</v>

558
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:48.500
<v Speaker 4>We just can't foresee what the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what that world would look like.</v>

559
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:53.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human beings might be obsolete in 20 </v>

560
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.841
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you listen to the last hour of the </v>

561
00:24:55.841 --> 00:24:55.841
<v Speaker 3>Sam Harris' podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Artificial intelligence?</v>

562
00:24:55.841 --> 00:24:57.190
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got into the first.</v>

563
00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:02.250
<v Speaker 4>I think I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't make it through the end of it </v>

564
00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.860
<v Speaker 4>the last hour and keeps me up at night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see there's a movie called x </v>

565
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.530
<v Speaker 4>mock and I'm going to see it tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So interesting.</v>

566
00:25:06.531 --> 00:25:08.210
<v Speaker 4>Half in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

567
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.910
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's haunting.</v>

568
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.090
<v Speaker 4>It's very well done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very small,</v>

569
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:18.750
<v Speaker 4>very contained independent movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's so well executed and you just </v>

570
00:25:18.941 --> 00:25:21.910
<v Speaker 4>leave like with a lot to think about.</v>

571
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.600
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>

572
00:25:23.601 --> 00:25:28.601
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a long sit down with Ray Kurzweil </v>

573
00:25:28.601 --> 00:25:31.750
<v Speaker 3>and I interviewed him for the Scifi show</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I did and we went back and forth </v>

574
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.891
<v Speaker 3>over the possibilities of this new era </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're entering into.</v>

575
00:25:36.711 --> 00:25:37.700
<v Speaker 3>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went to,</v>

576
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.650
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this global 20,</v>

577
00:25:39.651 --> 00:25:41.470
<v Speaker 3>45 initiative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

578
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.590
<v Speaker 3>That they were having a New York City </v>
<v Speaker 3>where all the futurists got together and</v>

579
00:25:45.591 --> 00:25:50.591
<v Speaker 3>they were all comparing notes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about the different </v>

580
00:25:50.591 --> 00:25:51.860
<v Speaker 3>possibilities for not just artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>

581
00:25:51.861 --> 00:25:54.620
<v Speaker 3>but symbiotic relationships with </v>
<v Speaker 3>computers,</v>

582
00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:58.130
<v Speaker 3>downloading consciousness into databases</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all this kind of crazy shit.</v>

583
00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:01.160
<v Speaker 3>And you walk away thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

584
00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:06.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if anybody knows where this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going and it's not going to stop.</v>

585
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.440
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be continual innovation</v>
<v Speaker 3>until we reach some,</v>

586
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.250
<v Speaker 3>some event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horizon of science,</v>

587
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.120
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some point of no return,</v>

588
00:26:20.121 --> 00:26:25.121
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some what they call ultimate novelty </v>

589
00:26:25.121 --> 00:26:25.121
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what Terence Mckenna used to call</v>

590
00:26:25.121 --> 00:26:25.121
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

591
00:26:25.121 --> 00:26:29.921
<v Speaker 3>this ultimate novelty point and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably gonna happen within our </v>

592
00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:34.001
<v Speaker 3>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably going to have within the </v>

593
00:26:34.001 --> 00:26:35.621
<v Speaker 3>next 20 or 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think it's going to happen that </v>

594
00:26:35.621 --> 00:26:35.621
<v Speaker 3>soon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

595
00:26:35.621 --> 00:26:37.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm just guessing it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's total guessing.</v>

596
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:42.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always the issue of natural </v>

597
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:43.601
<v Speaker 3>disasters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any real natural disaster would throw a </v>

598
00:26:43.601 --> 00:26:44.400
<v Speaker 3>massive hiccup into any plans</v>

599
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.340
<v Speaker 5>that anyone has.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

600
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:50.350
<v Speaker 5>if all we'd need is yellowstone to blow </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it would set back civilization to </v>

601
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.170
<v Speaker 5>three generations easily,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if not forever.</v>

602
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.970
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how about just California running out of</v>

603
00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:58.980
<v Speaker 5>water?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if we can get oil from Saudi </v>

604
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:04.280
<v Speaker 5>Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck can we not get water from </v>

605
00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:04.280
<v Speaker 5>Antarctica that everybody's whining </v>
<v Speaker 5>about those,</v>

606
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:09.320
<v Speaker 5>those ice caps melting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just stick a fucking big pipe on those </v>

607
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.140
<v Speaker 5>pitches and run them down to the almond </v>
<v Speaker 5>fields?</v>

608
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.980
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what's weird,</v>

609
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.470
<v Speaker 5>what's weird is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

610
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.220
<v Speaker 5>is how you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you didn't know better,</v>

611
00:27:17.221 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Speaker 5>you would think how hard can it be to </v>
<v Speaker 5>desalinate the ocean?</v>

612
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:23.910
<v Speaker 5>That's got to be elementary school </v>
<v Speaker 5>chemistry,</v>

613
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:29.030
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's interesting that it's so </v>

614
00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.101
<v Speaker 5>difficult that the best minds are having</v>
<v Speaker 5>such a hard time figuring that out and </v>

615
00:27:31.101 --> 00:27:35.241
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like the universe has rigged</v>
<v Speaker 5>it that way because human beings are </v>

616
00:27:35.241 --> 00:27:39.321
<v Speaker 5>such idiots that if they made it easy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our oceans would be dry deserts right </v>

617
00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.030
<v Speaker 5>now because we can't help ourselves.</v>

618
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.220
<v Speaker 5>We cannot help ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that is the same,</v>

619
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>compulsion that is propelling technology</v>

620
00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:52.431
<v Speaker 5>forward and will ultimately catapult us </v>
<v Speaker 5>into this ai universe that's going to </v>

621
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.900
<v Speaker 5>destroy us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

622
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.710
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think whatever it is,</v>

623
00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.630
<v Speaker 5>why we find that funny is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

624
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.280
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is true.</v>

625
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.630
<v Speaker 5>If we could fucking dry out the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we would have done it a long time ago.</v>

626
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.880
<v Speaker 5>Those houses in Malibu who were dog </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

627
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:14.690
<v Speaker 5>It's about $20,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>houses and that's not really a </v>

628
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:14.690
<v Speaker 5>$20,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>

629
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:16.620
<v Speaker 5>It's just $20,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's right there on the water.</v>

630
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:22.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That house would be worth fuck all </v>

631
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:24.960
<v Speaker 5>because there would be like a few </v>
<v Speaker 5>hundred yards of dirt in front of your </v>

632
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.161
<v Speaker 5>house now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean how hard can it be to separate </v>

633
00:28:28.161 --> 00:28:28.161
<v Speaker 5>salt from water?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently.</v>

634
00:28:28.161 --> 00:28:28.260
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

635
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.620
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

636
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:32.190
<v Speaker 5>they just opened up a large,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a desalination plant in San Diego.</v>

637
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:34.440
<v Speaker 5>I heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been over a billion dollars in this</v>

638
00:28:34.441 --> 00:28:35.850
<v Speaker 5>fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then give it a run.</v>

639
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:37.890
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think it's a matter of time.</v>

640
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:43.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's absolutely possible to take salt </v>

641
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.981
<v Speaker 5>out of water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't think that there's been as </v>

642
00:28:45.981 --> 00:28:49.161
<v Speaker 5>much incentive in the past as there is </v>
<v Speaker 5>now and now that California has gone on </v>

643
00:28:49.161 --> 00:28:54.081
<v Speaker 5>this three year drought where we need 11</v>
<v Speaker 5>trillion gallons of water just to bring </v>

644
00:28:54.631 --> 00:28:57.450
<v Speaker 5>us back to normal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

645
00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.040
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

646
00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:04.330
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of emblematic of how we deal </v>
<v Speaker 5>with problems because instead of trying </v>

647
00:29:04.981 --> 00:29:07.440
<v Speaker 5>to solve the problem that got us to this</v>
<v Speaker 5>place,</v>

648
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.020
<v Speaker 5>we're just looking for another source of</v>
<v Speaker 5>water,</v>

649
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.790
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of like taking,</v>

650
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking Viagra to deal with the fact that</v>

651
00:29:16.261 --> 00:29:19.590
<v Speaker 5>you can't get a boner instead of looking</v>
<v Speaker 5>at why it is you can't get a boner.</v>

652
00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.060
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean like you're,</v>

653
00:29:21.061 --> 00:29:22.590
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with the symptom.</v>

654
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.620
<v Speaker 5>But there are deserts that didn't use to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be deserts.</v>

655
00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:30.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean they're not because of humankind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's because of natural </v>

656
00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:30.940
<v Speaker 5>forces,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

657
00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.660
<v Speaker 5>So there is certainly one aspect of this</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can kind of point towards human</v>

658
00:29:36.301 --> 00:29:39.390
<v Speaker 5>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the reality of the earth,</v>

659
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.560
<v Speaker 5>the absolute reality of the earth is</v>

660
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.680
<v Speaker 3>climates change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oceans,</v>

661
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:46.330
<v Speaker 3>law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the levels change.</v>

662
00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:49.540
<v Speaker 3>They always have an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if people didn't exist,</v>

663
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:54.120
<v Speaker 3>you would have to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is there any sound like a climate,</v>

664
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:58.270
<v Speaker 3>but I'm definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I'm saying is we have this idea that</v>

665
00:29:58.271 --> 00:30:00.910
<v Speaker 3>once we're in a spot we should be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to stay in this spot,</v>

666
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.940
<v Speaker 3>this spot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are spots in North America.</v>

667
00:30:03.941 --> 00:30:08.941
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like half of North America was covered </v>

668
00:30:08.941 --> 00:30:08.941
<v Speaker 3>in a mile of ice just 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

669
00:30:08.941 --> 00:30:13.920
<v Speaker 3>That's a fact and we have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that if we want to like set up </v>

670
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:17.200
<v Speaker 3>a house and have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We only have five acres right here,</v>

671
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.920
<v Speaker 3>well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In 20 years for whatever reason,</v>

672
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:25.950
<v Speaker 3>that might not be a good spot anymore </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we have this idea that once we own </v>

673
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 3>property that that spot should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>livable and ideal forever.</v>

674
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.620
<v Speaker 3>And even if people didn't have anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do with the climate,</v>

675
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.540
<v Speaker 3>the climate will shift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>

676
00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.280
<v Speaker 3>Things change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They always will change.</v>

677
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:41.460
<v Speaker 3>We just have this really rigid idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like where we should be able to put </v>

678
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:41.460
<v Speaker 3>cities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

679
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.650
<v Speaker 3>when they keep finding these cities from</v>
<v Speaker 3>like several thousand years ago,</v>

680
00:30:44.651 --> 00:30:49.651
<v Speaker 3>like did she ever see those concentric </v>
<v Speaker 3>circles that they found in the water </v>

681
00:30:49.651 --> 00:30:52.621
<v Speaker 3>that they believe represents something </v>
<v Speaker 3>very similar to what Atlanta was </v>

682
00:30:52.621 --> 00:30:54.570
<v Speaker 3>described as Spain outside of Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>

683
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:59.600
<v Speaker 3>they've found many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many underground cities where at some </v>

684
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:04.411
<v Speaker 3>point in time the sea level change and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was long before carbon emissions,</v>

685
00:31:04.421 --> 00:31:08.560
<v Speaker 3>long before people were burning fossil </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuels and using machines.</v>

686
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just things shift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not to exonerate large </v>

687
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.440
<v Speaker 3>corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cole,</v>

688
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.890
<v Speaker 3>our dependence on fossil fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a totally separate argument.</v>

689
00:31:17.891 --> 00:31:20.770
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely think all you have to do is</v>

690
00:31:20.771 --> 00:31:23.080
<v Speaker 3>look at La from a fucking airplane or </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse.</v>

691
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.990
<v Speaker 3>I got photos of Mexico City.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

692
00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.600
<v Speaker 3>I was in Mexico City a couple months </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

693
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.870
<v Speaker 3>We go to Mexico City in June.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again for the UFC,</v>

694
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.340
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nicest people.</v>

695
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:34.510
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very friendly.</v>

696
00:31:34.511 --> 00:31:38.290
<v Speaker 3>Like you have this idea of Mexico City </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been like horrible crime ridden,</v>

697
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.700
<v Speaker 3>awful place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

698
00:31:39.701 --> 00:31:42.730
<v Speaker 3>They're really nice people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they just need better roads.</v>

699
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.070
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking pollution is insane.</v>

700
00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:50.370
<v Speaker 3>You can taste it with your face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you get out of the airplane </v>

701
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:50.370
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

702
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:55.141
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And apparently it's better than it used </v>

703
00:31:55.141 --> 00:31:55.141
<v Speaker 3>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether</v>

704
00:31:55.141 --> 00:31:55.470
<v Speaker 4>it's Mexico City or la,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

705
00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:00.480
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get this really kind of potent </v>

706
00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.380
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see the lights and the grid and you </v>

707
00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.801
<v Speaker 4>realize in the cars driving on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>freeway and you realize it's just an </v>

708
00:32:06.801 --> 00:32:06.801
<v Speaker 4>organism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

709
00:32:06.801 --> 00:32:09.960
<v Speaker 4>there's these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these freeways are carrying cars are the</v>

710
00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:14.961
<v Speaker 4>arteries and the cars of the blood cells</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're feeding these cities like </v>

711
00:32:14.961 --> 00:32:19.400
<v Speaker 4>their organs in this larger unit that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>interdependent.</v>

712
00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.380
<v Speaker 4>And it's interesting and I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

713
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you said about this idea of,</v>

714
00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:30.930
<v Speaker 4>of human beings and this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we think everything is static.</v>

715
00:32:30.931 --> 00:32:32.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that applies across the board.</v>

716
00:32:32.641 --> 00:32:34.440
<v Speaker 4>Like we think these cities will always </v>
<v Speaker 4>be there,</v>

717
00:32:34.441 --> 00:32:39.441
<v Speaker 4>but we also think that our lives are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are somewhat static or that our </v>

718
00:32:39.441 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 4>relationships are static or our jobs or </v>
<v Speaker 4>static or</v>

719
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.870
<v Speaker 5>our bank accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of these things.</v>

720
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

721
00:32:42.951 --> 00:32:45.500
<v Speaker 5>we kind of agreed to in this social </v>
<v Speaker 5>contract,</v>

722
00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:47.030
<v Speaker 5>but everything's fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

723
00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything is fluid and changing all the</v>

724
00:32:50.631 --> 00:32:55.631
<v Speaker 5>time on the micro level that leads to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the macro and it's always going to be </v>

725
00:32:55.971 --> 00:32:58.100
<v Speaker 5>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the also have to realize,</v>

726
00:32:58.101 --> 00:32:59.630
<v Speaker 5>I think we have to realize that one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

727
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.020
<v Speaker 5>I can't find these pictures of fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he posted that.</v>

728
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember when you saw my </v>
<v Speaker 5>instagram,</v>

729
00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:11.890
<v Speaker 5>but the point is that the only way a </v>
<v Speaker 5>city got to be a city in the first place</v>

730
00:33:11.991 --> 00:33:15.060
<v Speaker 5>is things have changed radically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you looked at where that city is,</v>

731
00:33:15.061 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 5>he was the Los Angeles where it is 400 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

732
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:19.670
<v Speaker 5>There was absolutely nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

733
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:24.680
<v Speaker 5>there's probably some native Americans </v>
<v Speaker 5>and some Mexicans and some various </v>

734
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.541
<v Speaker 5>people is back when it was Mexico and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were wandering around and doing </v>

735
00:33:28.541 --> 00:33:28.670
<v Speaker 5>their thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there was no.</v>

736
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:33.410
<v Speaker 5>There was no highways and sky rises and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all that stuff was really,</v>

737
00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:35.360
<v Speaker 5>really recent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in terms of the,</v>

738
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.270
<v Speaker 5>the actual age of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my God,</v>

739
00:33:38.271 --> 00:33:42.140
<v Speaker 5>it's like blink your eye and then all of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a sudden cities are literally a blink of</v>

740
00:33:42.141 --> 00:33:46.010
<v Speaker 5>an eye and then everything's polluted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything's fucked.</v>

741
00:33:46.011 --> 00:33:49.280
<v Speaker 5>And Malibu Beach Front property is </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculously overpriced,</v>

742
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.800
<v Speaker 5>but in the history of this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has there ever been more change?</v>

743
00:33:54.801 --> 00:33:58.460
<v Speaker 5>Planetary early with the exception of </v>
<v Speaker 5>natural disasters then there has been in</v>

744
00:33:58.461 --> 00:34:03.461
<v Speaker 5>the last 200 years when that sense </v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't human beings as a kind of a </v>

745
00:34:03.461 --> 00:34:04.940
<v Speaker 5>natural where a virus on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

746
00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:06.150
<v Speaker 5>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's called us.</v>

747
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.060
<v Speaker 5>He called caught a virus with shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

748
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:11.240
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mom.</v>

749
00:34:11.241 --> 00:34:15.380
<v Speaker 5>The opening of my.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a showtime special from like 2005.</v>

750
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:20.381
<v Speaker 5>I argued that if you looked at the earth</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a living organism and you're flying </v>

751
00:34:20.421 --> 00:34:21.830
<v Speaker 5>over and you saw la,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd go,</v>

752
00:34:21.831 --> 00:34:22.610
<v Speaker 5>well that's cancer.</v>

753
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:25.310
<v Speaker 5>That's a growth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's growing.</v>

754
00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.590
<v Speaker 5>It's out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's stinks.</v>

755
00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:30.890
<v Speaker 5>It looks like it's a mess and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting bigger.</v>

756
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:36.550
<v Speaker 5>We're greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bastards were lacking that gene that </v>

757
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:39.470
<v Speaker 5>prioritizes doing things sustainably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a huge problem.</v>

758
00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:42.710
<v Speaker 5>We're predatory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not symbiotic well.</v>

759
00:34:42.711 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 5>I think we have an an inescapable thirst</v>
<v Speaker 5>for innovation.</v>

760
00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:51.230
<v Speaker 5>We want new and better things and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>want progress.</v>

761
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.240
<v Speaker 5>And of course short sighted in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>regard.</v>

762
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.020
<v Speaker 5>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't,</v>

763
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:56.240
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're unable to see the bigger picture.</v>

764
00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:01.640
<v Speaker 5>We don't have the foresight to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to make the responsible decision quite </v>

765
00:35:01.971 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 5>often,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quite often.</v>

766
00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:03.950
<v Speaker 5>Well we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

767
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:09.040
<v Speaker 5>we err towards the size of prop started </v>
<v Speaker 5>toward the side of profit and success </v>

768
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.480
<v Speaker 5>and I oftentimes at the expense of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is that you think?</v>

769
00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>other animals don't have that.</v>

770
00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:24.330
<v Speaker 5>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though they do though they do </v>

771
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.600
<v Speaker 5>beavers fuck up dams and they create </v>
<v Speaker 5>dams and ruined rivers.</v>

772
00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:29.180
<v Speaker 5>They don't make beaver city says they </v>
<v Speaker 5>can now they could,</v>

773
00:35:29.181 --> 00:35:33.530
<v Speaker 5>they would get together and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they can chew more huge giant dam and</v>

774
00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:38.531
<v Speaker 5>the Mississippi River,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they can agree with each other and </v>

775
00:35:38.531 --> 00:35:38.580
<v Speaker 5>they would do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't give a fuck about,</v>

776
00:35:38.581 --> 00:35:40.740
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bears Shit.</v>

777
00:35:40.741 --> 00:35:42.150
<v Speaker 5>Wherever they walk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't,</v>

778
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:47.180
<v Speaker 5>they don't clean up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't have like a certain spot </v>

779
00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:47.180
<v Speaker 5>where they put all their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just don't have enough of an impact</v>

780
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.260
<v Speaker 5>to really change the environment around </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

781
00:35:49.261 --> 00:35:50.310
<v Speaker 5>But if they could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would.</v>

782
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:55.610
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was listening to a radio lab podcast </v>

783
00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:58.151
<v Speaker 5>about the Galapagos Islands and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>very fascinating because they had to </v>

784
00:35:58.151 --> 00:36:02.250
<v Speaker 5>eradicate goats because these sailors </v>
<v Speaker 5>had brought goats over,</v>

785
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:05.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way back in the day and they had brought</v>

786
00:36:05.461 --> 00:36:09.600
<v Speaker 5>goats and they put them on the island so</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they could come back and eat them,</v>

787
00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:14.601
<v Speaker 5>like they would have a food source,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but these goats just destroy everything </v>

788
00:36:14.601 --> 00:36:15.240
<v Speaker 5>in their path.</v>

789
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:19.380
<v Speaker 5>They just killed everything and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked it all up for the tortoise's.</v>

790
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.680
<v Speaker 5>These poor tortoise's we're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't have any plant matter </v>

791
00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:24.690
<v Speaker 5>anymore because all these goats were </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming along.</v>

792
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:27.720
<v Speaker 5>So then they hired these people to kill </v>
<v Speaker 5>the goats.</v>

793
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.840
<v Speaker 5>So they flew over and helicopters and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they gunned down the goats and then God </v>

794
00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.840
<v Speaker 5>started getting smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what they do was they would find </v>

795
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:36.840
<v Speaker 5>goats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would capture them,</v>

796
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.210
<v Speaker 5>they would put radio collars on them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would scare them.</v>

797
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.130
<v Speaker 5>They would run over to where the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>goats were,</v>

798
00:36:41.131 --> 00:36:42.330
<v Speaker 5>and then they would find where the goats</v>
<v Speaker 5>were.</v>

799
00:36:42.331 --> 00:36:44.850
<v Speaker 5>They would kill all of them except the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ones with the radio collars.</v>

800
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:47.700
<v Speaker 5>And so they became what they called </v>
<v Speaker 5>Judas goats.</v>

801
00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:52.050
<v Speaker 5>It's really fascinating how they set </v>
<v Speaker 5>this up and then it got to a point where</v>

802
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:55.800
<v Speaker 5>it was nothing but Judas goats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all that was left.</v>

803
00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.860
<v Speaker 5>And so then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

804
00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.450
<v Speaker 5>they tried to reintroduce tortoise's is </v>
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

805
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:05.840
<v Speaker 5>really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the argument could be made that any </v>

806
00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.530
<v Speaker 5>animal acting purely in its own interest</v>
<v Speaker 5>will ultimately fuck up everything </v>

807
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:14.151
<v Speaker 5>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's one of the reasons why there's </v>

808
00:37:14.151 --> 00:37:16.281
<v Speaker 5>gotta be some kind of a balance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has got to be some kind of a balance </v>

809
00:37:16.281 --> 00:37:19.611
<v Speaker 5>between humans and the plants that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>coexist with and the animals that we </v>

810
00:37:20.101 --> 00:37:22.560
<v Speaker 5>coexist with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the same can be said with animals,</v>

811
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:23.760
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

812
00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:25.950
<v Speaker 5>you can't have too many predators in an </v>
<v Speaker 5>area.</v>

813
00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:27.420
<v Speaker 5>You can't have too many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

814
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:31.080
<v Speaker 5>too many deer in an area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're run into them with cars,</v>

815
00:37:31.081 --> 00:37:34.740
<v Speaker 5>they start starving to death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get ticks and people start spreading</v>

816
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:39.830
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They start spreading lyme disease and </v>

817
00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:41.370
<v Speaker 5>there's like humans and animals and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>all act in their own interest.</v>

818
00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.210
<v Speaker 5>It's just we're the only ones that have </v>
<v Speaker 5>finger.</v>

819
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:49.310
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can manipulate shit and change the </v>

820
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:49.680
<v Speaker 5>environment in ways that no other animal</v>
<v Speaker 5>could even come close to.</v>

821
00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:52.270
<v Speaker 5>There is an infinitely complex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

822
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:57.320
<v Speaker 5>play that's going on and we insert </v>
<v Speaker 5>ourselves into that and we have this </v>

823
00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.440
<v Speaker 5>reductionist idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

824
00:37:58.441 --> 00:38:03.441
<v Speaker 5>if we insert this one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then that will fix the problem and what </v>

825
00:38:03.441 --> 00:38:05.240
<v Speaker 5>we don't do is really understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the,</v>

826
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.480
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

827
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:10.380
<v Speaker 5>the extent to which the Inter dependency</v>
<v Speaker 5>of everything else comes into play.</v>

828
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:15.710
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's true whether you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>introducing an animal to an ecology to </v>

829
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:19.491
<v Speaker 5>solve a problem and it creates a bigger </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem or whether you're taking a drug </v>

830
00:38:19.491 --> 00:38:24.000
<v Speaker 5>to resolve one condition that has side </v>
<v Speaker 5>effects or whether you're overly focused</v>

831
00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:29.001
<v Speaker 5>on one micronutrient or macronutrient as</v>
<v Speaker 5>the solution to your health problem.</v>

832
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:34.790
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything is more complicated than </v>

833
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:36.831
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think that we kind of </v>

834
00:38:36.831 --> 00:38:37.630
<v Speaker 5>embrace a more holistic approach to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

835
00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.660
<v Speaker 5>whether it's our problems or our health </v>
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

836
00:38:39.661 --> 00:38:40.750
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or what have you.</v>

837
00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.990
<v Speaker 5>That's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not part of our wiring and it's not</v>

838
00:38:43.991 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 5>part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

839
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:50.200
<v Speaker 5>the scientific method is by definition </v>
<v Speaker 5>reductionist because you have to isolate</v>

840
00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:52.780
<v Speaker 5>variables and look at one thing at a </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

841
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.520
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's very true.</v>

842
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.550
<v Speaker 5>It's very true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Science in and of itself is reductionist</v>

843
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:02.760
<v Speaker 5>and I think that there's also this weird</v>
<v Speaker 5>hope that people have that have like,</v>

844
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:06.190
<v Speaker 5>we fuck something up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then our backs get against the wall.</v>

845
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:09.490
<v Speaker 5>Then someone really smart will invent a </v>
<v Speaker 5>solution and it'll all be better.</v>

846
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:14.580
<v Speaker 5>You know that someone like right now is </v>
<v Speaker 5>analyzing the who knows how many fucking</v>

847
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.340
<v Speaker 5>trillions of pounds of plastic we've </v>
<v Speaker 5>dumped into the ocean and they're trying</v>

848
00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:23.341
<v Speaker 5>to figure out some way to suck all that </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff out and turn it into some sort of </v>

849
00:39:23.341 --> 00:39:26.650
<v Speaker 5>fuel or some resource that we can </v>
<v Speaker 5>capitalize on.</v>

850
00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.180
<v Speaker 5>That's those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those,</v>

851
00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.110
<v Speaker 5>those kinds of thinking or that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking is real common.</v>

852
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:35.020
<v Speaker 5>We always think that eventually someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>smarter,</v>

853
00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:37.180
<v Speaker 5>we'll figure out a way out of this mess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Elan Musk,</v>

854
00:39:37.181 --> 00:39:39.100
<v Speaker 5>it's going to solve it for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

855
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
<v Speaker 5>and I think that he might.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that part of that is just the </v>

856
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.810
<v Speaker 5>level of disenfranchisement that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>average person has.</v>

857
00:39:46.811 --> 00:39:48.760
<v Speaker 5>Like we just don't feel like our vote </v>
<v Speaker 5>counts.</v>

858
00:39:48.761 --> 00:39:51.070
<v Speaker 5>We don't feel like our dollar counts and</v>
<v Speaker 5>like fuck it,</v>

859
00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:56.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dancing with the stars is on and like I </v>

860
00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:59.071
<v Speaker 5>can't make a difference so I'm gonna </v>
<v Speaker 5>throw my garbage out the window and who </v>

861
00:39:59.071 --> 00:40:02.941
<v Speaker 5>cares?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just found out the dancing with the </v>

862
00:40:02.941 --> 00:40:03.820
<v Speaker 5>stars have been on for 10 years has it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never watched a single episode.</v>

863
00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:09.120
<v Speaker 5>I really have never.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been flipping through the channels </v>

864
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:09.120
<v Speaker 5>and I saw some people dancing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody cheering and I was like,</v>

865
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.560
<v Speaker 5>what in the actual fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I change the channel again.</v>

866
00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.410
<v Speaker 5>Like you were watching people dance now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

867
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:17.070
<v Speaker 5>Like nobody likes to dance like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was like,</v>

868
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:22.080
<v Speaker 5>okay then that will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that what like Mexican TV was </v>

869
00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.400
<v Speaker 5>dancing with his door as well as like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

870
00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:25.630
<v Speaker 5>you turn on like when we were kids it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

871
00:40:25.631 --> 00:40:27.380
<v Speaker 5>it was all song and dance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

872
00:40:27.381 --> 00:40:29.830
<v Speaker 5>and the Spanish television shows Spanish</v>
<v Speaker 5>network.</v>

873
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:31.600
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was all those crazy soap </v>
<v Speaker 5>operas.</v>

874
00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:32.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that too.</v>

875
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:36.050
<v Speaker 5>But that's what reality TV is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

876
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:41.100
<v Speaker 5>We've regressed in some ways while </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a part of us that really we </v>

877
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.270
<v Speaker 5>really love base things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

878
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:49.400
<v Speaker 5>we love emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I was just thinking of this the </v>

879
00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.770
<v Speaker 5>other day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the talk show host like um,</v>

880
00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:56.070
<v Speaker 5>like a Morton Downey jr or Jenny Jones </v>
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

881
00:40:56.410 --> 00:41:01.410
<v Speaker 5>or Geraldo Rivera,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any of those shows or like Montel </v>

882
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:06.720
<v Speaker 5>Williams where they would have guests </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they would go to the audience </v>

883
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.290
<v Speaker 5>and the audience would like say </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that would get everybody to go</v>

884
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:13.900
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that thing that they created,</v>

885
00:41:13.901 --> 00:41:14.310
<v Speaker 5>that parent.</v>

886
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.600
<v Speaker 5>Those are like the original Youtube </v>
<v Speaker 5>commenters.</v>

887
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.260
<v Speaker 5>There's like the original,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like social media commentators,</v>

888
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:25.560
<v Speaker 5>the people that are in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't have anything to do with </v>

889
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.501
<v Speaker 5>what's on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they get to interject and say </v>

890
00:41:28.501 --> 00:41:28.501
<v Speaker 5>something and then that becomes a part </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the entertainment.</v>

891
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.370
<v Speaker 5>But it's really just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

892
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.400
<v Speaker 5>it's weird social interaction between </v>
<v Speaker 5>human beings and us,</v>

893
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:37.540
<v Speaker 5>like sitting as sidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you showing?</v>

894
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.420
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

895
00:41:40.421 --> 00:41:41.080
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Springer,</v>

896
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:45.140
<v Speaker 5>he's the master of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a crazy way to make a living.</v>

897
00:41:45.141 --> 00:41:45.960
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

898
00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.930
<v Speaker 5>when that guy was a character.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

899
00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.190
<v Speaker 5>Is he still is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's still alive,</v>

900
00:41:49.191 --> 00:41:49.660
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

901
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:50.060
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

902
00:41:50.061 --> 00:41:52.260
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's actually a very intelligent guy.</v>

903
00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:54.620
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't even mayor prize land or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

904
00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:59.510
<v Speaker 5>And he got in troubles and prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cincinnati,</v>

905
00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:04.520
<v Speaker 5>there's a little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there was a little cocaine </v>

906
00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.870
<v Speaker 5>problem at one blow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

907
00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:09.500
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we enjoy those stupid moments that don't</v>

908
00:42:09.501 --> 00:42:10.250
<v Speaker 5>mean anything.</v>

909
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:15.730
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where someone says something and </v>

910
00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:15.730
<v Speaker 5>everybody goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

911
00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:19.210
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing wrong with a guilty </v>

912
00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:19.210
<v Speaker 5>pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

913
00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:20.000
<v Speaker 5>Not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

914
00:42:20.001 --> 00:42:21.890
<v Speaker 5>you can't fix the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't be captain.</v>

915
00:42:21.891 --> 00:42:24.110
<v Speaker 5>Save a hoe and go out there and fix the </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole world.</v>

916
00:42:24.111 --> 00:42:29.111
<v Speaker 5>Now go to the Jerry springer crowd and </v>
<v Speaker 5>start hanging out Kale leaves and you </v>

917
00:42:29.111 --> 00:42:32.961
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pamphlets for yoga classes snuck in a </v>

918
00:42:32.961 --> 00:42:32.961
<v Speaker 5>word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you talking about the ego?</v>

919
00:42:32.961 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 5>Talking about everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I eat Kale to dude,</v>

920

<v Speaker 5>it is a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

921
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:38.450
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

922
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:41.290
<v Speaker 5>if you've ever mocked like very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

923
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just really ridiculous proselytizing </v>

924
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.461
<v Speaker 5>vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I have people think all of a </v>

925
00:42:51.461 --> 00:42:53.381
<v Speaker 5>sudden just like vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they think I don't like them or don't </v>

926
00:42:53.381 --> 00:42:54.050
<v Speaker 5>eat that food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I eat that food.</v>

927
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.010
<v Speaker 5>Almost always I eat more vegetables that</v>
<v Speaker 5>I eat meat.</v>

928
00:42:58.011 --> 00:43:00.020
<v Speaker 5>I way more vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I eat a lot of it.</v>

929
00:43:00.021 --> 00:43:01.280
<v Speaker 5>I think it's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

930
00:43:01.281 --> 00:43:03.870
<v Speaker 5>vegans are an easy target that you guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>are easiest phone.</v>

931
00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:05.420
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so uh,</v>

932
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.310
<v Speaker 5>but you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

933
00:43:07.311 --> 00:43:09.900
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like the.</v>

934
00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.560
<v Speaker 5>If all vegans were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

935
00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:15.020
<v Speaker 5>there would be no target because like </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who just eat healthy,</v>

936
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:20.140
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just someone who enjoys eating </v>

937
00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:20.750
<v Speaker 5>plants instead of animal products and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just,</v>

938
00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:25.810
<v Speaker 5>that's just your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't become a fucking religion </v>

939
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:25.810
<v Speaker 5>with you.</v>

940
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:25.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

941
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.710
<v Speaker 4>first of all it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not my place to,</v>

942
00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:33.890
<v Speaker 4>to pass judgment on anybody else in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are behavior patterns in their </v>

943
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:35.070
<v Speaker 4>habits and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

944
00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

945
00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.530
<v Speaker 4>recruit people to my lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

946
00:43:40.531 --> 00:43:43.650
<v Speaker 4>if people want to ask me about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy to talk about it.</v>

947
00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.040
<v Speaker 4>But I'm not like yelling from a bully </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulpit,</v>

948
00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:51.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shaming people or the shaming I have.</v>

949
00:43:51.151 --> 00:43:52.890
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no,</v>

950
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:57.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>air of moral superiority about it </v>

951
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.950
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

952
00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:01.140
<v Speaker 4>it's a lifestyle that I choose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that,</v>

953
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:05.370
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that gives me permission to,</v>

954
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:10.910
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Levy judgment on any other human being </v>

955
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.910
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and their choices.</v>

956
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:11.830
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

957
00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:14.650
<v Speaker 4>the way that I try to communicate the </v>
<v Speaker 4>message is to,</v>

958
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.530
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

959
00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:20.540
<v Speaker 4>live my life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of stand where I'm standing and if </v>

960
00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:21.420
<v Speaker 4>people are interested and they'll come </v>
<v Speaker 4>to me and,</v>

961
00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:23.310
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can communicate to them.</v>

962
00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.370
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

963
00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:31.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a proselytizing point of view </v>

964
00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 4>that I adopt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think some</v>

965
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:37.130
<v Speaker 5>people adopt certain behaviors just </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it gives them license to be an </v>

966
00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:37.590
<v Speaker 5>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>

967
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:42.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean there are certain vegans that </v>
<v Speaker 5>think that because they are vegans,</v>

968
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:48.411
<v Speaker 5>they can go out and attack and be really</v>
<v Speaker 5>shitty to other people and somehow or </v>

969
00:44:48.411 --> 00:44:53.281
<v Speaker 5>another they're acting in a positive way</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're going to enact some positive</v>

970
00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:58.791
<v Speaker 5>change by being really shitty to people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like this idea of a social justice </v>

971
00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:04.041
<v Speaker 5>warrior falls into the same category by </v>
<v Speaker 5>being really mean to people that you </v>

972
00:45:04.041 --> 00:45:07.881
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>think the wrong way or behave the wrong </v>

973
00:45:07.881 --> 00:45:10.971
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that somehow or another you're going to </v>

974
00:45:10.971 --> 00:45:12.360
<v Speaker 5>shame them into changing by being really</v>
<v Speaker 5>aggressive and offensive to them.</v>

975
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shaming somebody is not an effective way</v>

976
00:45:16.261 --> 00:45:18.540
<v Speaker 5>of trying to getting them to change one </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the least effective.</v>

977
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:19.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

978
00:45:19.441 --> 00:45:21.270
<v Speaker 5>people change when they're ready to </v>
<v Speaker 5>change,</v>

979
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really an internal willingness that</v>

980
00:45:23.911 --> 00:45:28.911
<v Speaker 5>drives change and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody is either ready to make a </v>

981
00:45:28.911 --> 00:45:28.911
<v Speaker 5>change or they're not.</v>

982
00:45:28.911 --> 00:45:30.000
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and different people receive messages in</v>

983
00:45:30.001 --> 00:45:31.470
<v Speaker 5>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you look at,</v>

984
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.260
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look at the Vegan movement,</v>

985
00:45:34.261 --> 00:45:36.070
<v Speaker 5>because that's what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

986
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:39.930
<v Speaker 5>there are super hardcore animal rights </v>
<v Speaker 5>activists and they have a certain way of</v>

987
00:45:39.931 --> 00:45:44.931
<v Speaker 5>communicating and there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>population of people that are receptive </v>

988
00:45:44.931 --> 00:45:48.350
<v Speaker 5>to that kind of communication.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are other people that are </v>

989
00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:51.711
<v Speaker 5>interested in environmental issues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want to be better </v>

990
00:45:51.711 --> 00:45:54.651
<v Speaker 5>environmentalists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there are people that speak to </v>

991
00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:54.651
<v Speaker 5>the Vegan movement from that </v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective.</v>

992
00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:55.830
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

993
00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:00.860
<v Speaker 5>and there's a certain audience that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>receptive to that and the way that I </v>

994
00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.120
<v Speaker 5>communicated or carry the message is in </v>
<v Speaker 5>a different way.</v>

995
00:46:03.121 --> 00:46:03.810
<v Speaker 5>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

996
00:46:03.811 --> 00:46:05.430
<v Speaker 5>different people that are attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

997
00:46:05.431 --> 00:46:10.431
<v Speaker 5>So I think whatever your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your point of view is or whatever </v>

998
00:46:10.431 --> 00:46:13.701
<v Speaker 5>movement you're part of and that we can </v>
<v Speaker 5>get into the whole idea of how we're </v>

999
00:46:13.701 --> 00:46:15.780
<v Speaker 5>wired to be on teams and how </v>
<v Speaker 5>counterproductive that is.</v>

1000
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.070
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1001
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's enough people out there that </v>

1002
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:22.880
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1003
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a diversity of voices and a </v>

1004
00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:27.630
<v Speaker 5>diversity of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of audiences that,</v>

1005
00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:28.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every,</v>

1006
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:33.230
<v Speaker 5>every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every kind of voice carries a frequency </v>

1007
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.640
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1008
00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:38.930
<v Speaker 5>that other people respond to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess I didn't say that very </v>

1009
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.930
<v Speaker 5>articulately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know what you're saying though,</v>

1010
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:39.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

1011
00:46:39.181 --> 00:46:44.181
<v Speaker 5>there are definitely going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no one that responds well to </v>

1012
00:46:44.181 --> 00:46:44.340
<v Speaker 5>being insulted though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one.</v>

1013
00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:49.460
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're really trying to convey a </v>

1014
00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:49.460
<v Speaker 5>message being really shitty about it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the last thing.</v>

1015
00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:51.360
<v Speaker 5>Well look at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at political talk shows on Saturday</v>

1016
00:46:51.361 --> 00:46:54.360
<v Speaker 5>and Sunday morning and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 5>shouting at each other and and basically</v>

1017
00:46:54.361 --> 00:46:56.490
<v Speaker 5>they're just rallying support from their</v>
<v Speaker 5>base.</v>

1018
00:46:56.491 --> 00:46:59.460
<v Speaker 5>Each side they're trying to win,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not,</v>

1019
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.520
<v Speaker 5>they're not converting people from one </v>
<v Speaker 5>side to the other.</v>

1020
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:07.670
<v Speaker 5>No one ever gets converted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only way to have anybody ever gets </v>

1021
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:09.660
<v Speaker 5>converted as like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you can say something very thoughtful</v>

1022
00:47:09.661 --> 00:47:14.661
<v Speaker 5>that penetrates past this wall of </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideology they have in their head and </v>

1023
00:47:15.301 --> 00:47:17.310
<v Speaker 5>they go and then they have to consider </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1024
00:47:17.311 --> 00:47:18.990
<v Speaker 5>but they're not going to consider if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're insulting.</v>

1025
00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.000
<v Speaker 5>They're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be a contest.</v>

1026
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.420
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be a you versus them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You say something rude to them.</v>

1027
00:47:24.421 --> 00:47:27.330
<v Speaker 5>They're going to try say something rude </v>
<v Speaker 5>or to you and you're,</v>

1028
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:29.530
<v Speaker 5>you're playing ping pong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ping pong,</v>

1029
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:31.270
<v Speaker 3>ping pong with insults.</v>

1030
00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:33.010
<v Speaker 4>And to be clear like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1031
00:47:33.011 --> 00:47:35.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm a member of this community and you </v>

<v Speaker 4>It's in that juicy ladies.</v>

1035
00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:49.680
<v Speaker 4>Glasses don't have cards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just carry us here.</v>

1036
00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.340
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my theory on it,</v>

1037
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:52.960
<v Speaker 4>the people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are kind of,</v>

1038
00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:58.010
<v Speaker 4>you would characterize as vociferous and</v>
<v Speaker 4>angry and judgmental.</v>

1039
00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:03.210
<v Speaker 4>My theory is that there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>percentage of the population that come </v>

1040
00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:05.140
<v Speaker 4>out of the womb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm broken.</v>

1041
00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:06.520
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's that.</v>

1042
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:07.570
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's that.</v>

1043
00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:08.580
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1044
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:13.620
<v Speaker 4>there are those people for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there are other people that I think </v>

1045
00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.840
<v Speaker 4>are wired to be super sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1046
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:19.270
<v Speaker 4>And from a very early age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just find the idea of,</v>

1047
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:24.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an animal dying for food to be the most </v>

1048
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:24.430
<v Speaker 4>intolerable concept they can imagine.</v>

1049
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:25.390
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're just,</v>

1050
00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.640
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how they came into the world.</v>

1051
00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.500
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1052
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.360
<v Speaker 4>and so they kind of grow older and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>navigate the world and they start,</v>

1053
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:39.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>becoming sort of more outspoken about </v>

1054
00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:42.451
<v Speaker 4>this idea and when people are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>receptive to it or they're not seeing </v>

1055
00:48:42.451 --> 00:48:43.090
<v Speaker 4>the world the way that they're seeing </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1056
00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.790
<v Speaker 4>they become progressively more </v>
<v Speaker 4>frustrated.</v>

1057
00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:48.160
<v Speaker 4>And that frustration turns to </v>
<v Speaker 4>resentment.</v>

1058
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.700
<v Speaker 4>That resentment can morph into anger and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you know,</v>

1059
00:48:51.701 --> 00:48:54.380
<v Speaker 4>you have what you see which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is people who are,</v>

1060
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:59.430
<v Speaker 4>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just incensed that other people </v>

1061
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.430
<v Speaker 4>are not seeing the world the way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're seeing it.</v>

1062
00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:04.590
<v Speaker 4>And I think that applies to any </v>
<v Speaker 4>contingent of the population that holds </v>

1063
00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:05.470
<v Speaker 4>a very strong point of view.</v>

1064
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.220
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

1065
00:49:07.221 --> 00:49:09.280
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1066
00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:14.340
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely going to be certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are hardwired for </v>

1067
00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.111
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just no getting around it and </v>

1068
00:49:17.111 --> 00:49:17.111
<v Speaker 3>you realize that when you have children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1069
00:49:17.111 --> 00:49:20.150
<v Speaker 3>I have two young daughters that are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

1070
00:49:20.151 --> 00:49:21.680
<v Speaker 3>They're only two years apart from each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

1071
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:24.590
<v Speaker 3>grew up in the same household.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could not be more different.</v>

1072
00:49:24.591 --> 00:49:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just right out of the box.</v>

1073
00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:27.400
<v Speaker 3>They're just different people.</v>

1074
00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:32.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You realize like he had nothing to do </v>

1075
00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:32.830
<v Speaker 4>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:32.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>

1077
00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:34.710
<v Speaker 3>you have a little bit to do with how </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1078
00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:38.730
<v Speaker 3>how they process things and how they </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with things based on learned</v>

1079
00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:43.810
<v Speaker 4>that innate core kind of perspective and</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever they're naturally inclined to </v>

1080
00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.730
<v Speaker 4>is just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see it at such a young age.</v>

1081
00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the difference,</v>

1082
00:49:48.391 --> 00:49:51.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The difference is like what,</v>

1083
00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:56.240
<v Speaker 3>what is a real part of them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is a real part of them?</v>

1084
00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:58.110
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1085
00:49:58.111 --> 00:50:03.111
<v Speaker 3>what is just inescapable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they have certain ingredients like </v>

1086
00:50:03.111 --> 00:50:05.550
<v Speaker 3>a car is made out of aluminum and rubber</v>
<v Speaker 3>and metal.</v>

1087
00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:10.850
<v Speaker 3>There's certain ingredients that certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have when they're born and also </v>

1088
00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:15.530
<v Speaker 3>inclinations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inclinations towards certain activities </v>

1089
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:19.491
<v Speaker 3>like we were talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like trying to find things that make </v>

1090
00:50:19.491 --> 00:50:19.920
<v Speaker 3>your children happy and try and </v>
<v Speaker 3>encourage things that make your children</v>

1091
00:50:19.921 --> 00:50:24.921
<v Speaker 3>happy to find a thing that they like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that jives with their ingredients.</v>

1092
00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:28.490
<v Speaker 3>And some people</v>

1093
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:33.520
<v Speaker 5>they look at animals and they just have </v>
<v Speaker 5>this inescapable in this capable kinship</v>

1094
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:35.510
<v Speaker 5>and some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone that kinship is ridiculous.</v>

1095
00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:40.530
<v Speaker 5>The point where he ever read those </v>
<v Speaker 5>tumblr blogs where people think that </v>

1096
00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:41.130
<v Speaker 5>there should have been born a fox,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have fox,</v>

1097
00:50:41.131 --> 00:50:46.131
<v Speaker 5>can you never seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sounds like something red band </v>

1098
00:50:46.131 --> 00:50:47.180
<v Speaker 5>which spent a lot of time doing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking he used to be just being,</v>

1099
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being on like weird tumblr sites.</v>

1100
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:54.950
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're tumblr sites can get very </v>

1101
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:57.071
<v Speaker 5>addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You wonder whether or not you're being </v>

1102
00:50:57.071 --> 00:50:57.071
<v Speaker 5>trolled,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1103
00:50:57.071 --> 00:50:57.071
<v Speaker 5>some of them are so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You wonder like,</v>

1104
00:50:57.071 --> 00:50:58.490
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so this is this real,</v>

1105
00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:00.680
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1106
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fox can you never heard of that?</v>

1107
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:07.900
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't to look around at people that </v>

1108
00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:07.900
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1109
00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:08.030
<v Speaker 5>they believe that they should have been </v>
<v Speaker 5>born as foxes.</v>

1110
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:09.260
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1111
00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.680
<v Speaker 5>They believe their Fox came spirit open </v>
<v Speaker 5>minded thinker.</v>

1112
00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:18.610
<v Speaker 5>There's other dimensions that play.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You saw interstellar I didn't see in </v>

1113
00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:19.520
<v Speaker 5>yourself that you didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't seen it yet.</v>

1114
00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:20.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking busy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

1115
00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:22.760
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

1116
00:51:22.761 --> 00:51:24.360
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea is just,</v>

1117
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:30.270
<v Speaker 5>that's a ridiculous idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I also think that there's also </v>

1118
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:31.880
<v Speaker 5>people that have this very idealistic </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea of animals and nature itself,</v>

1119
00:51:31.881 --> 00:51:32.720
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1120
00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:37.730
<v Speaker 5>there's some videos we've been shown </v>
<v Speaker 5>recently with a deer that are eating </v>

1121
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:39.740
<v Speaker 5>birds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eating birds alive,</v>

1122
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:44.800
<v Speaker 5>which apparently is a recent discovery </v>
<v Speaker 5>that deer are not really just </v>

1123
00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.240
<v Speaker 5>herbivores.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're herbivores by convenience,</v>

1124
00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:49.640
<v Speaker 5>but when they find a birds on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground,</v>

1125
00:51:49.641 --> 00:51:51.780
<v Speaker 5>they eat them and they seek them out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They actually chased them.</v>

1126
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:57.750
<v Speaker 5>Is that a result of encroaching habitat </v>
<v Speaker 5>by urban centers or no?</v>

1127
00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.920
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are wild beer in very rural areas </v>

1128
00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:03.910
<v Speaker 5>there have been observed to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's uh,</v>

1129
00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.020
<v Speaker 5>apparently they're getting minerals and </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff from,</v>

1130
00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.360
<v Speaker 5>from deer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from a bird's brother,</v>

1131
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:13.630
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're more inclined to do so when </v>

1132
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:13.630
<v Speaker 5>they're growing their antlers.</v>

1133
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:13.630
<v Speaker 5>They feel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1134
00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:14.330
<v Speaker 5>more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1135
00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.630
<v Speaker 5>more drawn to eating birds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

1136
00:52:17.631 --> 00:52:18.620
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1137
00:52:18.621 --> 00:52:21.430
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of videos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of disturbing because you,</v>

1138
00:52:21.431 --> 00:52:24.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though I'm a hunter and I eat deer,</v>

1139
00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:30.220
<v Speaker 5>I think they're beautiful and I always </v>
<v Speaker 5>think of him as being these peaceful </v>

1140
00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:34.061
<v Speaker 5>things and we see them chasing a bird </v>
<v Speaker 5>and just chewing it alive and fucking </v>

1141
00:52:34.761 --> 00:52:37.400
<v Speaker 5>things kicking inside of their mouth and</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to get away.</v>

1142
00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:38.450
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just,</v>

1143
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:40.340
<v Speaker 5>they're part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1144
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:45.400
<v Speaker 5>natural cycle of life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just trying to survive like </v>

1145
00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:45.770
<v Speaker 5>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think,</v>

1146
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:49.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think to the casual observer,</v>

1147
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:54.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or somebody who's listening to this </v>

1148
00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.171
<v Speaker 5>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they may think that there's this giant </v>

1149
00:52:56.171 --> 00:52:57.710
<v Speaker 5>gap between the way that you live in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>way that I live.</v>

1150
00:52:57.711 --> 00:53:00.780
<v Speaker 5>And I think there's actually a bigger </v>
<v Speaker 5>gap between the way that I live in,</v>

1151
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:02.930
<v Speaker 5>in the normal human being than yourself </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of,</v>

1152
00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:04.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1153
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:05.540
<v Speaker 5>you're a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't hunt,</v>

1154
00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:10.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not something that I'm interested </v>

1155
00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:12.371
<v Speaker 5>in doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have a connection to where your </v>

1156
00:53:12.371 --> 00:53:12.900
<v Speaker 5>food is coming from that is very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1157
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:15.260
<v Speaker 5>close and primal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1158
00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:20.180
<v Speaker 5>and in the grand scheme of things more </v>
<v Speaker 5>sustainable than the way that,</v>

1159
00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the average typical American,</v>

1160
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:25.860
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of more sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But honestly,</v>

1161
00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:26.460
<v Speaker 5>not</v>

1162
00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:28.080
<v Speaker 3>for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reality,</v>

1163
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.430
<v Speaker 4>not everybody could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1164
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:31.910
<v Speaker 4>not everybody can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1165
00:53:31.911 --> 00:53:36.911
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that right now our food system is </v>

1166
00:53:36.911 --> 00:53:37.520
<v Speaker 4>broken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1167
00:53:37.521 --> 00:53:37.880
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

1168
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:39.770
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our system of factory farming.</v>

1169
00:53:39.771 --> 00:53:44.771
<v Speaker 4>It's unsustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually brought you this documentary </v>

1170
00:53:44.771 --> 00:53:47.150
<v Speaker 4>called cowspiracy spirits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1171
00:53:47.151 --> 00:53:48.670
<v Speaker 4>cowspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1172
00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:53.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was involved in a producing this </v>

1173
00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:53.880
<v Speaker 4>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should check it out.</v>

1174
00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.311
<v Speaker 4>But basically it's a look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the impact of animal agriculture on </v>

1175
00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:00.320
<v Speaker 4>our environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's hard.</v>

1176
00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:01.310
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty interesting.</v>

1177
00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:06.420
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that video that they got a drone video </v>

1178
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:11.430
<v Speaker 3>of these gigantic pig farms and the just</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking unbelievable environmental </v>

1179
00:54:13.661 --> 00:54:18.661
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe these things create.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would they have lakes of piss and shit </v>

1180
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:21.040
<v Speaker 3>from these pigs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different.</v>

1181
00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:26.310
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen it now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Haven't you really should see it and </v>

1182
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:26.310
<v Speaker 3>perceiving it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull that video up,</v>

1183
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's.</v>

1184
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.220
<v Speaker 3>It's insane to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you stop and think about the,</v>

1185
00:54:30.221 --> 00:54:30.770
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1186
00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:34.540
<v Speaker 3>the amount of Smithfield foods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>factory farms.</v>

1187
00:54:34.541 --> 00:54:38.200
<v Speaker 3>That's it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If this guy flies his drone,</v>

1188
00:54:38.201 --> 00:54:43.201
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty fucking cool that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have these drones now that you could do </v>

1189
00:54:43.201 --> 00:54:45.961
<v Speaker 3>this and get this high resolution video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well if you're dealing with a place like</v>

1190
00:54:46.271 --> 00:54:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$20,</v>

1191
00:54:47.511 --> 00:54:52.511
<v Speaker 3>million people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 million people and 95 percent of the </v>

1192
00:54:52.511 --> 00:54:56.041
<v Speaker 3>meat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with an insane amount of </v>

1193
00:54:56.041 --> 00:54:59.221
<v Speaker 3>flash that needs to be consumed on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>daily basis and it has to be grown </v>

1194
00:54:59.221 --> 00:55:00.580
<v Speaker 3>somewhere and ship somewhere and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conveniently.</v>

1195
00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:05.580
<v Speaker 3>We want to sort of ignore it like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a lake of shit and piss and it's all </v>

1196
00:55:06.821 --> 00:55:10.840
<v Speaker 3>coming from these factories right there </v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of you.</v>

1197
00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Those are housing units for pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're stuffed into these things </v>

1198
00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:19.360
<v Speaker 3>crammed next to each other and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand on these metal grates.</v>

1199
00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:22.150
<v Speaker 3>So the metal grates are poorest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They piss and shit.</v>

1200
00:55:22.151 --> 00:55:27.151
<v Speaker 3>It goes through the holes and it all </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes through these tubes that lead down </v>

1201
00:55:27.151 --> 00:55:29.410
<v Speaker 3>into that giant lake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently the smell,</v>

1202
00:55:29.411 --> 00:55:34.411
<v Speaker 3>if you're anywhere near there is so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You literally feel like you could </v>

1203
00:55:34.411 --> 00:55:35.680
<v Speaker 3>probably like the air on fire.</v>

1204
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure Smithfield,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smithfield is not too excited about this</v>

1205
00:55:39.481 --> 00:55:44.481
<v Speaker 4>video being out there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's all these ag gag laws right now </v>

1206
00:55:44.481 --> 00:55:45.720
<v Speaker 4>that prevent consumers from filming this</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of thing.</v>

1207
00:55:45.721 --> 00:55:49.470
<v Speaker 4>So that's insane that he's been able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do this with a drone and you know,</v>

1208
00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:50.900
<v Speaker 4>whether you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1209
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:54.570
<v Speaker 4>whether you eat bacon for breakfast </v>
<v Speaker 4>every morning or you eat more like me.</v>

1210
00:55:54.571 --> 00:55:58.680
<v Speaker 4>I think we can all agree that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that transparency is important and these</v>

1211
00:55:58.681 --> 00:56:03.681
<v Speaker 4>companies are not transparent about how </v>
<v Speaker 4>they produce their food and there's a </v>

1212
00:56:03.681 --> 00:56:07.551
<v Speaker 4>lot of problems with it and the waste </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it creates and the amount of </v>

1213
00:56:07.551 --> 00:56:11.370
<v Speaker 4>resources and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what goes into this process is something</v>

1214
00:56:11.371 --> 00:56:14.790
<v Speaker 4>that I think we could all benefit from </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking a harder look at.</v>

1215
00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:19.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be interesting is if you go to the </v>

1216
00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:19.850
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cowspiracy website,</v>

1217
00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:21.510
<v Speaker 4>they have all these facts about kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1218
00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 4>every sort of environmental of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of</v>

1219
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:29.250
<v Speaker 2>what animal agriculture does from water </v>
<v Speaker 2>use to see co two emissions to land use </v>

1220
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:32.090
<v Speaker 2>to species extinction to rainforest </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction.</v>

1221
00:56:32.091 --> 00:56:33.820
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at the statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1222
00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:35.860
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely crazy.</v>

1223
00:56:35.861 --> 00:56:38.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like the elephant in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1224
00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:40.570
<v Speaker 2>we talk about when we talk about global </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate change or,</v>

1225
00:56:40.571 --> 00:56:42.880
<v Speaker 2>or greenhouse gas emissions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talk about,</v>

1226
00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:47.290
<v Speaker 2>we talk about fossil fuel use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talk about fracking and rightly so.</v>

1227
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:48.970
<v Speaker 2>These are important things to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1228
00:56:48.971 --> 00:56:53.800
<v Speaker 2>But really the thing that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking enough about is the impact of,</v>

1229
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:56.680
<v Speaker 2>of our food system on all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>

1230
00:56:56.681 --> 00:56:58.300
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1231
00:56:58.301 --> 00:56:59.590
<v Speaker 2>water use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about water,</v>

1232
00:56:59.591 --> 00:57:00.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1233
00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:04.630
<v Speaker 2>you know there's PSA is in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not supposed to take long showers,</v>

1234
00:57:04.631 --> 00:57:06.760
<v Speaker 2>we can't water our lawns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these sorts of things.</v>

1235
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:11.790
<v Speaker 2>And the truth is is that consumer water </v>
<v Speaker 2>use in California is like five percent </v>

1236
00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:16.120
<v Speaker 2>and animal agriculture accounts for like</v>
<v Speaker 2>55 percent of all water use.</v>

1237
00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:19.210
<v Speaker 2>And you know what a bonus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what the really big useless one</v>

1238
00:57:19.211 --> 00:57:19.720
<v Speaker 2>is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1239
00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:22.310
<v Speaker 2>golf quality horses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well animal agriculture,</v>

1240
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:27.390
<v Speaker 2>trump's golf courses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least animal agriculture is like </v>

1241
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:27.390
<v Speaker 2>feeding animals at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1242
00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just feeding fuck right.</v>

1243
00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:32.260
<v Speaker 2>Dude's rolling balls around on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grass.</v>

1244
00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:37.350
<v Speaker 2>That's an insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insane amount of water for your </v>

1245
00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:37.350
<v Speaker 2>amusement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1246
00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:41.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it takes something like 660 </v>
<v Speaker 2>gallons of water to produce a hamburger </v>

1247
00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:47.980
<v Speaker 2>and like a thousand gallons of milk or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand gallons of water to produce one</v>

1248
00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:49.330
<v Speaker 2>gallon of milk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

1249
00:57:49.331 --> 00:57:51.940
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the statistics are completely insane and</v>

1250
00:57:51.941 --> 00:57:56.941
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of it is the water that's </v>

1251
00:57:56.941 --> 00:57:56.941
<v Speaker 2>used to grow the grain that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeding to these animals.</v>

1252
00:57:56.941 --> 00:57:58.710
<v Speaker 2>So when you look at it systemically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1253
00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:03.250
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't like if you were an alien who</v>

1254
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:08.280
<v Speaker 2>beamed down to planet earth and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take me to your leader and show me how </v>

1255
00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:08.280
<v Speaker 2>you make your food.</v>

1256
00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:09.730
<v Speaker 2>He would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are crazy.</v>

1257
00:58:09.731 --> 00:58:11.520
<v Speaker 2>You're like killing the planet to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1258
00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:12.250
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't.</v>

1259
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:15.290
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Sustainable in the longterm.</v>

1260
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:19.900
<v Speaker 2>If we did it exactly the way we're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it right now forever.</v>

1261
00:58:19.901 --> 00:58:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Would that be sustainable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1262
00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:23.450
<v Speaker 2>Can we can do it right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1263
00:58:23.451 --> 00:58:25.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way that we're doing it right now.</v>

1264
00:58:25.661 --> 00:58:29.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're destroying like rain forest</v>
<v Speaker 2>like crazy,</v>

1265
00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:30.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like one to two acres,</v>

1266
00:58:30.851 --> 00:58:32.950
<v Speaker 2>like every hour or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that.</v>

1267
00:58:32.951 --> 00:58:37.060
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is due to their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting exotic hardwoods and all</v>

1268
00:58:37.061 --> 00:58:40.450
<v Speaker 2>these different and saw lumbering and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some of that for sure.</v>

1269
00:58:40.451 --> 00:58:42.730
<v Speaker 2>And there's palm oil and there's other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

1270
00:58:42.731 --> 00:58:47.731
<v Speaker 2>But I think the gravity men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the majority of it goes to grazing </v>

1271
00:58:47.731 --> 00:58:49.630
<v Speaker 2>land and growing crops for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for livestock.</v>

1272
00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:51.820
<v Speaker 2>And this is other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not America,</v>

1273
00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:55.530
<v Speaker 2>America Amazonian rain forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not cutting down the rainforest in</v>

1274
00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:57.640
<v Speaker 2>America and we're not getting our beef </v>
<v Speaker 2>from there either,</v>

1275
00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.290
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1276
00:58:59.291 --> 00:59:02.620
<v Speaker 2>like an insane amount of our total land </v>
<v Speaker 2>mass is devoted to,</v>

1277
00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:05.320
<v Speaker 2>is devoted to animal agriculture too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1278
00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:10.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like billions of these animals that</v>

1279
00:59:10.091 --> 00:59:12.910
<v Speaker 2>were specifically raising to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1280
00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:13.960
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1281
00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:16.750
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge problem.</v>

1282
00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:22.140
<v Speaker 2>It is a huge problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is something that is outside of </v>

1283
00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:22.310
<v Speaker 2>your normal</v>

1284
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:27.310
<v Speaker 5>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>normal everyday thinking you're getting </v>

1285
00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:27.310
<v Speaker 5>on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>goddammit.</v>

1286
00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:27.650
<v Speaker 5>There's traffic today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're getting to work.</v>

1287
00:59:27.651 --> 00:59:32.651
<v Speaker 5>Oh Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got this new project we have to </v>

1288
00:59:32.651 --> 00:59:32.651
<v Speaker 5>deal with and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1289
00:59:32.651 --> 00:59:34.490
<v Speaker 5>you're real existence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like all that stuff is bullshit.</v>

1290
00:59:34.491 --> 00:59:36.830
<v Speaker 5>If you don't have any food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that traffic,</v>

1291
00:59:36.831 --> 00:59:38.540
<v Speaker 5>all the work stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1292
00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:41.090
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have any food.</v>

1293
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:46.360
<v Speaker 5>Like this is like here's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's a bunch of things that you need </v>

1294
00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:49.331
<v Speaker 5>to have in place before you think about </v>
<v Speaker 5>any other hobbies or projects or </v>

1295
00:59:49.331 --> 00:59:51.410
<v Speaker 5>whatever you're trying to accomplish </v>
<v Speaker 5>with your career.</v>

1296
00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.470
<v Speaker 5>You got to have a place where you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>breathe.</v>

1297
00:59:54.471 --> 00:59:55.760
<v Speaker 5>The air,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1298
00:59:55.761 --> 00:59:58.820
<v Speaker 5>the air has to be clean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one on the ocean,</v>

1299
00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:03.440
<v Speaker 5>has to be hospitable for fish and plant </v>
<v Speaker 5>life for us.</v>

1300
01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.610
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're a Vegan,</v>

1301
01:00:04.611 --> 01:00:09.611
<v Speaker 5>you really don't need to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything other than the plant life in </v>

1302
01:00:09.611 --> 01:00:11.861
<v Speaker 5>the ocean if you're only kelp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but actually calculate a very good </v>

1303
01:00:11.861 --> 01:00:11.861
<v Speaker 5>source of protein.</v>

1304
01:00:11.861 --> 01:00:13.040
<v Speaker 5>That goes back to this reductionist </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea,</v>

1305
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.890
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are complex ecosystems,</v>

1306
01:00:14.891 --> 01:00:18.140
<v Speaker 5>so you knock one thing out in the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the domino effect of that,</v>

1307
01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:23.200
<v Speaker 5>you know like these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the runoff that's caused from waste </v>

1308
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:25.820
<v Speaker 5>animal agriculture is a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's all kinds of ways.</v>

1309
01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:30.850
<v Speaker 5>Just Susan the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it creates these massive dead zone </v>

1310
01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:31.400
<v Speaker 5>dead zones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Algal blooms,</v>

1311
01:00:31.401 --> 01:00:33.020
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That deprives them like,</v>

1312
01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:38.380
<v Speaker 5>like thousands of acres worth across the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ocean that are so oxygen deprived that </v>

1313
01:00:39.051 --> 01:00:40.610
<v Speaker 5>nothing can live in them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1314
01:00:40.611 --> 01:00:44.570
<v Speaker 5>there was a big die off when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 5>her most a beach a couple of years ago.</v>

1315
01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.510
<v Speaker 5>They had a giant fish die off where it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>

1316
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:49.280
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so fucking stinky.</v>

1317
01:00:49.281 --> 01:00:51.260
<v Speaker 5>It was so nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wash up on the shore.</v>

1318
01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.320
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they just died like in certain </v>

1319
01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:56.320
<v Speaker 5>bays,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1320
01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.100
<v Speaker 5>there was an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an area where they just hit a dead zone </v>

1321
01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:03.101
<v Speaker 5>and a bunch of fish died and supernormal</v>
<v Speaker 5>very common happens all the time and it </v>

1322
01:01:03.591 --> 01:01:05.300
<v Speaker 5>smelled so bad.</v>

1323
01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:05.920
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1324
01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:08.010
<v Speaker 5>probably a fucking million dead fish or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

1325
01:01:08.011 --> 01:01:09.320
<v Speaker 5>I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1326
01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:11.690
<v Speaker 5>awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when we're.</v>

1327
01:01:11.691 --> 01:01:13.040
<v Speaker 5>So what we're getting at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>

1328
01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:13.790
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1329
01:01:13.791 --> 01:01:17.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as typical consumers were,</v>

1330
01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.360
<v Speaker 5>were divorced from that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not in our face.</v>

1331
01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:21.770
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we're not really,</v>

1332
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.410
<v Speaker 5>we don't have to reckon with that on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>daily basis,</v>

1333
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:29.440
<v Speaker 5>is it possible that like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could you have an entire city of 20 </v>

1334
01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.240
<v Speaker 5>million people?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't have an entire city of 20 </v>

1335
01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:34.240
<v Speaker 5>million people that lived as hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You really couldn't.</v>

1336
01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.010
<v Speaker 5>You would need more animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But could you have an entire city of 20 </v>

1337
01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:39.860
<v Speaker 5>million people that were Vegan?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1338
01:01:39.861 --> 01:01:40.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1339
01:01:40.241 --> 01:01:43.340
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the amount of land that you need to</v>

1340
01:01:43.341 --> 01:01:45.860
<v Speaker 5>grow food for vegans is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1341
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:47.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a fraction,</v>

1342
01:01:47.691 --> 01:01:52.691
<v Speaker 5>a tiny fraction of the amount of land </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is required to raise animals for </v>

1343
01:01:52.691 --> 01:01:55.600
<v Speaker 5>food because the animals have to eat a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of food in order to get to a size.</v>

1344
01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:56.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need,</v>

1345
01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:59.410
<v Speaker 5>you need tons of grazing land and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1346
01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:04.840
<v Speaker 5>like if you go to go to cowspiracy.com</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's a section called facts and </v>

1347
01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:05.860
<v Speaker 5>they kind of break it all down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of interesting to look at.</v>

1348
01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:06.500
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1349
01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:08.390
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think that,</v>

1350
01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:12.500
<v Speaker 5>that the amount of land,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we're producing enough food to feed</v>

1351
01:02:12.501 --> 01:02:17.501
<v Speaker 5>the planet really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really like an allocation and </v>

1352
01:02:17.501 --> 01:02:18.220
<v Speaker 5>distribution issue as much as any </v>
<v Speaker 5>meeting we use like American,</v>

1353
01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.400
<v Speaker 5>but most of the food that we're growing</v>

1354
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.070
<v Speaker 2>in the bread basket of America is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to livestock.</v>

1355
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:26.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like the corn fields,</v>

1356
01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:29.700
<v Speaker 2>they're also making that core and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really not even edible for humans.</v>

1357
01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:30.530
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1358
01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:33.120
<v Speaker 2>you see you saw king corn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1359
01:02:33.121 --> 01:02:33.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

1360
01:02:33.631 --> 01:02:35.850
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing documentary.</v>

1361
01:02:35.851 --> 01:02:38.190
<v Speaker 2>We're all like made out of fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>

1362
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:43.460
<v Speaker 2>when they do the tests on their body and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find out that the carbon for core </v>

1363
01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:47.461
<v Speaker 2>and then human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the carbon in their body is coming from </v>

1364
01:02:47.461 --> 01:02:47.670
<v Speaker 2>corn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you find out how much,</v>

1365
01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:53.120
<v Speaker 2>how many different things at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supermarket when they went through the </v>

1366
01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.791
<v Speaker 2>supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they looked at all the different things </v>

1367
01:02:55.791 --> 01:02:55.791
<v Speaker 2>that have corn syrup and corn starch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corn,</v>

1368
01:02:55.791 --> 01:02:55.950
<v Speaker 2>corn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this corn that.</v>

1369
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:57.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1370
01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:02.900
<v Speaker 2>how did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did they hijack the entire food </v>

1371
01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:02.900
<v Speaker 2>system?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1372
01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.160
<v Speaker 2>you don't write amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd fucking corn,</v>

1373
01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all that stuff that they're using </v>

1374
01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.951
<v Speaker 2>corn for is not really necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can profit off of it if you own </v>

1375
01:03:13.741 --> 01:03:18.741
<v Speaker 2>the corn and if you have some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the government,</v>

1376
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:23.460
<v Speaker 2>you can get a subsidy subsidy's and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens.</v>

1377
01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:24.840
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're being fed off subsidies.</v>

1378
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:26.820
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that was most </v>
<v Speaker 2>disturbing about it.</v>

1379
01:03:26.821 --> 01:03:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

1380
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:32.420
<v Speaker 2>this is so destructive and this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you guys couldn't even afford to </v>

1381
01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.480
<v Speaker 2>grow this shit if it wasn't for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

1382
01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:37.560
<v Speaker 2>If the government didn't pay corn </v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers,</v>

1383
01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:41.460
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have government subsidies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them would just go under.</v>

1384
01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that we're,</v>

1385
01:03:43.341 --> 01:03:46.920
<v Speaker 2>we're entrenched in this system that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent upon these subsidies.</v>

1386
01:03:46.921 --> 01:03:51.921
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so much of our economy functions in </v>

1387
01:03:51.921 --> 01:03:54.771
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think if we really want to change </v>

1388
01:03:54.771 --> 01:03:54.771
<v Speaker 2>our food system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to eradicate these subsidies.</v>

1389
01:03:54.771 --> 01:03:56.340
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1390
01:03:56.341 --> 01:03:57.930
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why.</v>

1391
01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.290
<v Speaker 2>I think we talked about this last time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>

1392
01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:04.200
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why like Taco Bell Taco</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like whatever it is,</v>

1393
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:07.650
<v Speaker 2>dollar and nine cents or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like it's the same price.</v>

1394
01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:11.280
<v Speaker 2>It was when we were 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how does that work?</v>

1395
01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:17.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Mcdonald's cheeseburger is like two </v>

1396
01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:18.030
<v Speaker 2>bucks or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you factor in,</v>

1397
01:04:18.031 --> 01:04:23.031
<v Speaker 2>like if you look at it from a Meta </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective and you take into account </v>

1398
01:04:23.031 --> 01:04:24.360
<v Speaker 2>all the subsidies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1399
01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:27.720
<v Speaker 2>a big Mac would actually cost something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 7:50</v>

1400
01:04:27.721 --> 01:04:30.270
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like a multiple on its price.</v>

1401
01:04:30.271 --> 01:04:33.900
<v Speaker 2>There's a book called metagenomics by </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy called David Simon where he,</v>

1402
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:35.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet and Omics,</v>

1403
01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:41.240
<v Speaker 2>and he really breaks down how these </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidies work and how that kind of </v>

1404
01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.061
<v Speaker 2>fuels this food system that really is </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating it.</v>

1405
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:46.270
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1406
01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:48.540
<v Speaker 2>it's making the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1407
01:04:48.541 --> 01:04:51.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lower socioeconomic class,</v>

1408
01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:56.541
<v Speaker 2>like less and less healthy because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating this wider gap between healthy </v>

1409
01:04:56.541 --> 01:04:59.100
<v Speaker 2>living and unhealthy living because in </v>
<v Speaker 2>food deserts,</v>

1410
01:04:59.101 --> 01:05:02.400
<v Speaker 2>in urban food deserts where there is no </v>
<v Speaker 2>farmer's market,</v>

1411
01:05:02.401 --> 01:05:06.090
<v Speaker 2>but there's Mcdonald's and Jack in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>box on every corner and you know,</v>

1412
01:05:06.091 --> 01:05:07.950
<v Speaker 2>you're on welfare and you got three </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

1413
01:05:07.951 --> 01:05:08.970
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

1414
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to eat shitty food is too </v>

1415
01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:14.400
<v Speaker 2>cheap to not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really good point.</v>

1416
01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:18.370
<v Speaker 2>That's a really good point as far as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount that it costs</v>

1417
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.930
<v Speaker 5>for these things and that the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's because of subsidies as a result of</v>

1418
01:05:22.931 --> 01:05:27.610
<v Speaker 5>that we're in this place right now where</v>
<v Speaker 5>suddenly health and wellness have become</v>

1419
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:29.130
<v Speaker 5>elitist ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1420
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:31.090
<v Speaker 5>synonymous with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1421
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:34.000
<v Speaker 5>spending a ton of money at whole foods </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's crazy.</v>

1422
01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:37.300
<v Speaker 5>Are you opposed to eating like chicken </v>
<v Speaker 5>eggs,</v>

1423
01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:42.350
<v Speaker 5>like from someone who grows chickens and</v>
<v Speaker 5>has them like free ranging and you know,</v>

1424
01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:48.140
<v Speaker 5>like I have chickens that they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they lay eggs every day and they're,</v>

1425
01:05:48.141 --> 01:05:49.840
<v Speaker 5>they're essentially my pets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I eat,</v>

1426
01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:52.200
<v Speaker 5>I eat my pet's food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1427
01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:57.210
<v Speaker 5>I feed them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they eat a lot of the table scraps but </v>

1428
01:05:57.210 --> 01:05:57.560
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1429
01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.770
<v Speaker 5>a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just free range.</v>

1430
01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:04.771
<v Speaker 5>They run around eating stuff in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>grass and bugs and from like an ethical </v>

1431
01:06:05.051 --> 01:06:05.950
<v Speaker 5>point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1432
01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:11.970
<v Speaker 5>if you're raising your own chickens and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like your pets and they're </v>

1433
01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:12.760
<v Speaker 5>laying eggs that are not going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1434
01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:17.790
<v Speaker 5>turn into chickens than I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>ethically I don't really see a problem </v>

1435
01:06:18.101 --> 01:06:18.550
<v Speaker 5>with that.</v>

1436
01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.030
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like like they're not going to,</v>

1437
01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not going to knock those eggs,</v>

1438
01:06:24.491 --> 01:06:29.491
<v Speaker 5>are not going to turn into chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Peter has this thing on their </v>

1439
01:06:29.491 --> 01:06:32.491
<v Speaker 5>website about eggs being chicken periods</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're trying to discourage people </v>

1440
01:06:32.491 --> 01:06:33.850
<v Speaker 5>from eating eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen it?</v>

1441
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:39.750
<v Speaker 5>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of those things where it just </v>

1442
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:40.480
<v Speaker 5>shows you like the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

1443
01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:46.080
<v Speaker 5>there's ethical considerations when it </v>
<v Speaker 5>comes to livestock and animals that are </v>

1444
01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.650
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've rational,</v>

1445
01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.680
<v Speaker 5>they make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you get into this extreme </v>

1446
01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.221
<v Speaker 5>animal rights ideology where they try to</v>
<v Speaker 5>twist reality and so they have like a </v>

1447
01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:59.230
<v Speaker 5>bloody bloody pair of underwear and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>chicken.</v>

1448
01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:00.200
<v Speaker 5>Like here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>

1449
01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:05.880
<v Speaker 5>Eggs come from chicken menstruation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're frying a bloody pair of </v>

1450
01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.391
<v Speaker 5>underwear in a frying pan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't eat eggs period.</v>

1451
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:13.990
<v Speaker 5>And the word period is red,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like period blood.</v>

1452
01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:17.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is the stage of my Peta.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're very effective at marketing.</v>

1453
01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.500
<v Speaker 5>They were talking while we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it right now,</v>

1454
01:07:20.501 --> 01:07:21.910
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about how retarded they </v>
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>

1455
01:07:21.911 --> 01:07:24.610
<v Speaker 5>I eat seven more eggs today just because</v>
<v Speaker 5>of these assets.</v>

1456
01:07:25.350 --> 01:07:27.540
<v Speaker 5>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not like effective.</v>

1457
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:29.080
<v Speaker 5>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>

1458
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:34.170
<v Speaker 5>if you have chickens at your home and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're your pets and your kids play </v>

1459
01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:37.981
<v Speaker 5>with them and they're laying eggs that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are not going to turn into chickens and </v>

1460
01:07:37.981 --> 01:07:38.770
<v Speaker 5>you decide that you want to eat those </v>
<v Speaker 5>eggs from a,</v>

1461
01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.820
<v Speaker 5>from a morality point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like how can I.</v>

1462
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:47.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really see how I could have a </v>

1463
01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.291
<v Speaker 5>big problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now if you decide that you want to cut </v>

1464
01:07:49.291 --> 01:07:52.351
<v Speaker 5>the head off that chicken and fry it up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then then when it comes up because well </v>

1465
01:07:52.351 --> 01:07:53.610
<v Speaker 5>it's becomes a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1466
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:55.480
<v Speaker 5>Becomes different than becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 5>different thing.</v>

1467
01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:59.020
<v Speaker 5>What was the last time he ate meat?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's been awhile.</v>

1468
01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:03.760
<v Speaker 5>I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you went vegan and it's been,</v>

1469
01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.820
<v Speaker 5>has been eight years coming up on nine </v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe.</v>

1470
01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:11.880
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever smell like your neighbor </v>

1471
01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:11.880
<v Speaker 5>cooking a steak and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1472
01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1473
01:08:13.271 --> 01:08:15.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm not one of those people who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1474
01:08:15.010 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 5>it repulses me and I</v>

1475
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.280
<v Speaker 4>want to throw up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1476
01:08:17.281 --> 01:08:19.520
<v Speaker 4>like I got into it for health reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1477
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:21.620
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I listened.</v>

1478
01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:24.550
<v Speaker 4>I've eaten more meat in my lifetime than</v>
<v Speaker 4>any human being ever should,</v>

1479
01:08:24.570 --> 01:08:25.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I'm not,</v>

1480
01:08:26.210 --> 01:08:27.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it,</v>

1481
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:30.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I drive by Mcdonald's or Jack in the box</v>

1482
01:08:30.741 --> 01:08:34.160
<v Speaker 4>and I smell that and that we might </v>
<v Speaker 4>discuss some people,</v>

1483
01:08:34.161 --> 01:08:37.160
<v Speaker 4>but it triggers like this addictive </v>
<v Speaker 4>response in me where it's like,</v>

1484
01:08:37.161 --> 01:08:38.570
<v Speaker 4>I will crave that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1485
01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:41.900
<v Speaker 4>because there's so much time has passed </v>
<v Speaker 4>between me and eating those foods.</v>

1486
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:47.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of obsessive compulsive thing </v>

1487
01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:47.420
<v Speaker 4>that kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm also,</v>

1488
01:08:47.421 --> 01:08:49.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm a recovering alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I have.</v>

1489
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:50.300
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1490
01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:55.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can get addicted to things pretty </v>

1491
01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:55.660
<v Speaker 4>fucking easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1492
01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:57.320
<v Speaker 4>So that's part of my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like for me to draw a lot,</v>

1493
01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:57.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1494
01:08:57.831 --> 01:09:02.831
<v Speaker 4>kind of a line in the sand and say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no more is kind of the way that I have </v>

1495
01:09:02.831 --> 01:09:07.211
<v Speaker 4>to do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise it inhabits my </v>

1496
01:09:07.211 --> 01:09:07.211
<v Speaker 4>consciousness too much.</v>

1497
01:09:07.211 --> 01:09:09.530
<v Speaker 4>But you have to put up boundaries where </v>
<v Speaker 4>the unsurmountable boundaries,</v>

1498
01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:13.340
<v Speaker 4>there are certain diets that say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1499
01:09:13.341 --> 01:09:14.960
<v Speaker 4>you can have a cheat day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1500
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:19.370
<v Speaker 4>So it's like if you told me that I could</v>
<v Speaker 4>have in and out burger like once a week,</v>

1501
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:24.490
<v Speaker 4>like I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would spend six days thinking about </v>

1502
01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:24.490
<v Speaker 4>the day that I could have in and out </v>
<v Speaker 4>burger.</v>

1503
01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:29.141
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in order to free myself from that </v>

1504
01:09:29.141 --> 01:09:30.410
<v Speaker 4>prison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need time away.</v>

1505
01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:31.610
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1506
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:33.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1507
01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:38.200
<v Speaker 4>it's really powerful with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a cheeseburger or a drink </v>

1508
01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:38.810
<v Speaker 4>or a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1509
01:09:38.811 --> 01:09:39.890
<v Speaker 4>and that's just me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1510
01:09:39.891 --> 01:09:42.380
<v Speaker 4>it's just my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when I smelled that,</v>

1511
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:43.430
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>triggers that thing,</v>

1512
01:09:43.431 --> 01:09:44.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1513
01:09:44.061 --> 01:09:46.340
<v Speaker 4>that's good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it passes quickly,</v>

1514
01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:51.760
<v Speaker 4>but if I was eating those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might find myself driving into the </v>

1515
01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:51.760
<v Speaker 4>drive through.</v>

1516
01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.790
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's an issue with people that have </v>

1517
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:56.860
<v Speaker 5>eating disorders where the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like the,</v>

1518
01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:02.100
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the desire to have that forbidden food </v>

1519
01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:04.660
<v Speaker 5>overwhelms their desire to be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like that,</v>

1520
01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.300
<v Speaker 5>that it just becomes this thing like </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got,</v>

1521
01:10:07.301 --> 01:10:09.260
<v Speaker 5>I've got an itch it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got an Itch,</v>

1522
01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:11.210
<v Speaker 5>itchy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to scratch it.</v>

1523
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:13.550
<v Speaker 5>I can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1524
01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:17.330
<v Speaker 5>Transcends logic and it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychological.</v>

1525
01:10:17.331 --> 01:10:20.840
<v Speaker 5>It becomes a psychological issue way </v>
<v Speaker 5>more than it is a physiological issue.</v>

1526
01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:26.320
<v Speaker 4>It's almost beyond psychology though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's so embedded now for anybody </v>

1527
01:10:28.811 --> 01:10:31.610
<v Speaker 4>who's truly like an addict or an </v>
<v Speaker 4>alcoholic like it.</v>

1528
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.820
<v Speaker 4>It goes to the core,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1529
01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:37.720
<v Speaker 4>there is no overriding it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When that kicks in,</v>

1530
01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:40.120
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's happening.</v>

1531
01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:43.380
<v Speaker 5>I had a friend who was on the Atkins </v>
<v Speaker 5>Diet and my friend Eddie Bravo,</v>

1532
01:10:43.450 --> 01:10:48.450
<v Speaker 5>he was on the Atkins Diet and he would </v>
<v Speaker 5>do it for six days a week and then </v>

1533
01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:53.150
<v Speaker 5>midnight on Saturday night that mother </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucker would go off the rails like a </v>

1534
01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:57.160
<v Speaker 5>runaway train piloted by a meth addict.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1535
01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.350
<v Speaker 5>You.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you intuit for?</v>

1536
01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:01.230
<v Speaker 5>What do you intuit from that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1537
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.990
<v Speaker 5>Like he's building a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He loaded up all week.</v>

1538
01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:07.680
<v Speaker 5>So it worked though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But why would you.</v>

1539
01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:13.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that an atkins diet is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>healthy diet because I don't think it </v>

1540
01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:13.160
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1541
01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 5>but what's wrong an atkins diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you</v>

1542
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.410
<v Speaker 4>could say so from an.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1543
01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:19.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm not a nutritional scientists </v>
<v Speaker 4>dots or you know,</v>

1544
01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:24.530
<v Speaker 4>I would say that that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm a diet that's super focused on </v>

1545
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:30.590
<v Speaker 4>basically excluding anything with any </v>
<v Speaker 4>carbohydrates in it and eating foods </v>

1546
01:11:30.991 --> 01:11:34.260
<v Speaker 4>that are devoid of any fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is really important.</v>

1547
01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.750
<v Speaker 4>We talk about protein a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think most people,</v>

1548
01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:39.360
<v Speaker 4>I think that conversation should really </v>
<v Speaker 4>be about fiber,</v>

1549
01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:44.390
<v Speaker 4>like nobody's protein deficient.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think three percent of the population </v>

1550
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:47.631
<v Speaker 4>has protein deficient.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most Americans are fiber deficient </v>

1551
01:11:47.631 --> 01:11:47.631
<v Speaker 4>though we just don't eat enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetables.</v>

1552
01:11:47.631 --> 01:11:52.460
<v Speaker 4>But as the atkins diet fiber deficient </v>
<v Speaker 4>manner did they tell you can eat </v>

1553
01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:52.460
<v Speaker 4>broccoli.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that they.</v>

1554
01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:54.240
<v Speaker 4>I think that there a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a focus on,</v>

1555
01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.070
<v Speaker 4>on meat and dairy products,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1556
01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.990
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm not an expert on the,</v>

1557
01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:00.510
<v Speaker 4>on the atkins diet sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1558
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:04.020
<v Speaker 4>It's like being in Ketosis and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a very,</v>

1559
01:12:04.021 --> 01:12:07.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hot button thing and you know,</v>

1560
01:12:07.021 --> 01:12:10.650
<v Speaker 4>there are people that are all about like</v>
<v Speaker 4>being in Ketosis and my understanding of</v>

1561
01:12:10.651 --> 01:12:13.620
<v Speaker 4>that is that it's kind of a crisis state</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the human body.</v>

1562
01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:18.621
<v Speaker 4>It's not a natural state of being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of like what your body has to </v>

1563
01:12:18.621 --> 01:12:20.490
<v Speaker 4>do when it's being deprived of other </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrients to be in this state.</v>

1564
01:12:20.491 --> 01:12:23.610
<v Speaker 4>Like you put these acid ketones in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>body,</v>

1565
01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:28.640
<v Speaker 4>which then are converted to some form of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Glucose because you're so glucose </v>

1566
01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:28.710
<v Speaker 4>deprived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1567
01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:31.590
<v Speaker 4>Our brains run on Glucose or bodies need</v>
<v Speaker 4>glucose.</v>

1568
01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.120
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at,</v>

1569
01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:36.120
<v Speaker 4>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1570
01:12:36.121 --> 01:12:41.121
<v Speaker 4>the longest living pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pockets of civilization across the </v>

1571
01:12:41.121 --> 01:12:43.320
<v Speaker 4>world where people live the longest and </v>
<v Speaker 4>are the healthiest in are the happiest.</v>

1572
01:12:43.321 --> 01:12:45.000
<v Speaker 4>Like the blue zones you've heard of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>blue zones,</v>

1573
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:45.570
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1574
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:50.570
<v Speaker 4>So Dan Buettner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's the guy who traveled to all of </v>

1575
01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:50.970
<v Speaker 4>these places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a friend of mine's amazing guy.</v>

1576
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:52.920
<v Speaker 4>You should have them on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's amazing.</v>

1577
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:56.940
<v Speaker 4>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dan Buettner be you be you e t,</v>

1578
01:12:56.941 --> 01:13:00.720
<v Speaker 4>t e n e r,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a national geographic fellow.</v>

1579
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:04.380
<v Speaker 4>He's so impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's what's his,</v>

1580
01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:05.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his uh,</v>

1581
01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:10.040
<v Speaker 4>well he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the guy who wrote the blue zones </v>

1582
01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:10.040
<v Speaker 4>books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>

1583
01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:10.040
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1584
01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:13.260
<v Speaker 4>like a global adventurer who set like </v>
<v Speaker 4>three world records,</v>

1585
01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:16.840
<v Speaker 4>like cycling across the planet doing all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these crazy things and,</v>

1586
01:13:16.841 --> 01:13:18.240
<v Speaker 4>and cycling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1587
01:13:18.241 --> 01:13:21.600
<v Speaker 4>he rode his bike across Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like north to south,</v>

1588
01:13:21.601 --> 01:13:26.601
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck you wrote across Russia </v>

1589
01:13:26.601 --> 01:13:27.840
<v Speaker 4>like when this was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he was younger and then,</v>

1590
01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:28.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1591
01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:31.530
<v Speaker 4>he became interested in indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 4>populations.</v>

1592
01:13:31.531 --> 01:13:33.480
<v Speaker 4>He started working with National </v>
<v Speaker 4>Geographic.</v>

1593
01:13:33.481 --> 01:13:38.481
<v Speaker 4>He became a writer and a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in his travels he became obsessed </v>

1594
01:13:38.491 --> 01:13:41.790
<v Speaker 4>with finding places where people are the</v>
<v Speaker 4>happiest,</v>

1595
01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:44.130
<v Speaker 4>live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the longest free of disease,</v>

1596
01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:49.170
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that ultimately became what are </v>

1597
01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:49.170
<v Speaker 4>today known as the blue zones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like these,</v>

1598
01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:52.890
<v Speaker 4>like these little sort of hidden pockets</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the planet that are kind of untouched</v>

1599
01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:56.320
<v Speaker 4>from the gestalt of our modern society </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1600
01:13:56.370 --> 01:13:59.010
<v Speaker 4>they're little tiny places kind of off </v>
<v Speaker 4>the beaten path.</v>

1601
01:13:59.011 --> 01:13:59.320
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1602
01:13:59.500 --> 01:13:59.870
<v Speaker 4>Eco,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1603
01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like an island off the coast of</v>

1604
01:14:01.681 --> 01:14:03.480
<v Speaker 4>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sardinia,</v>

1605
01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:07.230
<v Speaker 4>Okinawa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and ironically Loma Linda here,</v>

1606
01:14:07.231 --> 01:14:09.420
<v Speaker 4>like not too far from here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the Loma Linda,</v>

1607
01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:10.740
<v Speaker 4>which is pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1608
01:14:10.741 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 4>And that's at work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

1609
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:17.010
<v Speaker 2>a cultural thing because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>community of seventh day adventists and </v>

1610
01:14:17.441 --> 01:14:22.441
<v Speaker 2>it's a very strong faith based community</v>
<v Speaker 2>that also basically subsist on a plant </v>

1611
01:14:22.441 --> 01:14:24.910
<v Speaker 2>based diet and they live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They live incredibly long.</v>

1612
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:29.560
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the seven day adventist adventist,</v>

1613
01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:33.680
<v Speaker 2>seventh day adventist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird word.</v>

1614
01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:34.660
<v Speaker 2>They are live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say it.</v>

1615
01:14:34.661 --> 01:14:39.661
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're saying it correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like you're doing it wrong and </v>

1616
01:14:39.661 --> 01:14:41.850
<v Speaker 2>it's a very strong faith based community</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they a based diet,</v>

1617
01:14:42.970 --> 01:14:44.980
<v Speaker 2>physical activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social engagement,</v>

1618
01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:47.560
<v Speaker 2>social engagement support and huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>

1619
01:14:47.610 --> 01:14:48.320
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1620
01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.110
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so from,</v>

1621
01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:55.170
<v Speaker 2>from studying these cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he extracted certain kind of guiding </v>

1622
01:14:55.170 --> 01:14:59.701
<v Speaker 2>principles about how they live their </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and one of them to get back to the </v>

1623
01:14:59.701 --> 01:15:01.780
<v Speaker 2>question about kind of Atkins Diet is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1624
01:15:01.781 --> 01:15:04.640
<v Speaker 2>they all eat a very starchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1625
01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:09.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fiber rich essentially plant based diet </v>

1626
01:15:09.710 --> 01:15:09.710
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean they're all vegans like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1627
01:15:09.710 --> 01:15:09.790
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of meat.</v>

1628
01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:14.790
<v Speaker 2>But essentially their diet is founded </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon starchy vegetables for the most </v>

1629
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1630
01:15:14.801 --> 01:15:19.801
<v Speaker 2>and community and accountability and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of keeping your elders around and </v>

1631
01:15:19.801 --> 01:15:20.840
<v Speaker 2>all these sorts of things have really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1632
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:25.390
<v Speaker 2>distinguishes them as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1633
01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:29.170
<v Speaker 2>from the way that we live our lives now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1634
01:15:29.171 --> 01:15:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1635
01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:30.150
<v Speaker 2>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1636
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:32.890
<v Speaker 2>we're isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're fast paced and all these sorts of,</v>

1637
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:37.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of principles upon which we </v>

1638
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:40.710
<v Speaker 2>navigate our day or just very divorced </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the way that these people are </v>

1639
01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:42.760
<v Speaker 2>living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that it says empowered women.</v>

1640
01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:47.820
<v Speaker 2>Empowered women is a factor in age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1641
01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:50.590
<v Speaker 2>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what that's about.</v>

1642
01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:53.380
<v Speaker 2>A big part of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had Dan on my podcast,</v>

1643
01:15:53.381 --> 01:15:54.670
<v Speaker 2>so if people are listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>

1644
01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:56.290
<v Speaker 2>they can check him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was great.</v>

1645
01:15:56.291 --> 01:15:57.200
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1646
01:15:57.710 --> 01:15:59.860
<v Speaker 2>a big part of it too is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1647
01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:05.540
<v Speaker 2>is having purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sort of identifying early on in </v>

1648
01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:05.540
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1649
01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what your purpose is and,</v>

1650
01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:08.260
<v Speaker 2>and serving that purpose.</v>

1651
01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.390
<v Speaker 2>And these people don't retire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1652
01:16:10.391 --> 01:16:11.860
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sort of,</v>

1653
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:16.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living and continuing to be productive </v>

1654
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:19.951
<v Speaker 2>like way later in life than we're used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to seeing enjoying your time here and </v>

1655
01:16:19.951 --> 01:16:24.391
<v Speaker 2>that positive energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's attached to enjoying your time </v>

1656
01:16:24.391 --> 01:16:25.420
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sustains your existence in a much better</v>

1657
01:16:25.421 --> 01:16:27.070
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1658
01:16:27.071 --> 01:16:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of low grade exercise.</v>

1659
01:16:30.071 --> 01:16:30.880
<v Speaker 2>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1660
01:16:30.881 --> 01:16:32.590
<v Speaker 2>they're always moving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1661
01:16:32.591 --> 01:16:34.780
<v Speaker 2>they're not out running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not on the treadmill,</v>

1662
01:16:34.810 --> 01:16:39.810
<v Speaker 2>but they're in their garden and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking to their friend's house and you </v>

1663
01:16:39.810 --> 01:16:43.951
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very engaged with their </v>

1664
01:16:43.951 --> 01:16:43.951
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're constantly very intimate way.</v>

1665
01:16:43.951 --> 01:16:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know I had a Aubrey de Grey on </v>

1666
01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:50.100
<v Speaker 2>the other day who's a life extension </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientist as a,</v>

1667
01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:55.520
<v Speaker 2>at the forefront of the various </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies are being developed to </v>

1668
01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:00.301
<v Speaker 2>extend life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said the difference between the </v>

1669
01:17:00.301 --> 01:17:03.571
<v Speaker 2>average and these cultures where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>live far longer is four years.</v>

1670
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:08.650
<v Speaker 2>That's the big goal that everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to attain.</v>

1671
01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Like live like these people that</v>

1672
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:13.050
<v Speaker 3>live the longest and that's four years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four.</v>

1673
01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.270
<v Speaker 3>There's a four year difference,</v>

1674
01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:15.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I think,</v>

1675
01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:20.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in these blue zones they have the </v>

1676
01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:20.580
<v Speaker 4>highest percentage per capita of </v>
<v Speaker 4>centenarians.</v>

1677
01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:24.280
<v Speaker 4>People living longer than 100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's less about that age </v>

1678
01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:24.470
<v Speaker 4>than it is about the quality of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your years.</v>

1679
01:17:24.471 --> 01:17:25.120
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1680
01:17:25.650 --> 01:17:26.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1681
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:30.360
<v Speaker 4>go to the airport and look at how many </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are in wheelchairs and you know,</v>

1682
01:17:30.361 --> 01:17:35.361
<v Speaker 4>on walkers and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People that are not old go to </v>

1683
01:17:35.361 --> 01:17:35.361
<v Speaker 4>Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1684
01:17:35.361 --> 01:17:35.361
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

1685
01:17:35.361 --> 01:17:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever go to Disneyland people on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Scooters overflowing out of the side of </v>

1686
01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:42.930
<v Speaker 3>the scooters with their legs and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>gut and just who?</v>

1687
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:45.870
<v Speaker 4>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So right now in America,</v>

1688
01:17:45.930 --> 01:17:48.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can split hairs over,</v>

1689
01:17:48.721 --> 01:17:50.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should you take fish oil or not,</v>

1690
01:17:50.701 --> 01:17:54.240
<v Speaker 4>or is it okay for you to eat the eggs </v>
<v Speaker 4>from your chicken and your backyard?</v>

1691
01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:58.320
<v Speaker 4>But the truth is this is not the problem</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we need to be talking about.</v>

1692
01:17:58.321 --> 01:18:02.490
<v Speaker 4>We need to be talking about the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that one out of every three Americans is</v>

1693
01:18:02.491 --> 01:18:07.491
<v Speaker 4>going to die of a heart attack and 70 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent of Americans are obese or </v>

1694
01:18:07.491 --> 01:18:09.150
<v Speaker 4>overweight and they're predicting that </v>
<v Speaker 4>by 20,</v>

1695
01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:14.151
<v Speaker 4>30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 percent of Americans are going to be </v>

1696
01:18:14.151 --> 01:18:15.110
<v Speaker 4>diabetic or prediabetic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just think about that is that real</v>

1697
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:16.820
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30,</v>

1698
01:18:16.821 --> 01:18:20.990
<v Speaker 3>50 percent of Americans are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>diabetic or prediabetic diabetes.</v>

1699
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:24.290
<v Speaker 3>Fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One out of it.</v>

1700
01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.990
<v Speaker 4>Every three people is going to die of </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart disease.</v>

1701
01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:31.730
<v Speaker 4>Heart disease is a lifestyle and </v>
<v Speaker 4>foodborne illness.</v>

1702
01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:37.080
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have to exist and we're in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this place right now where it's sort of </v>

1703
01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.150
<v Speaker 4>like some congenital verge there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There,</v>

1704
01:18:38.151 --> 01:18:40.540
<v Speaker 4>there is for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not worth.</v>

1705
01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:44.360
<v Speaker 4>But if you look back through the history</v>
<v Speaker 4>of mankind,</v>

1706
01:18:44.361 --> 01:18:49.361
<v Speaker 4>there are plenty of populations that </v>
<v Speaker 4>existed for hundreds and thousands of </v>

1707
01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:53.240
<v Speaker 4>years without any significant incidence </v>
<v Speaker 4>of heart disease,</v>

1708
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:58.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in rural areas of China for </v>

1709
01:18:58.930 --> 01:19:03.580
<v Speaker 4>long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long years until we started exporting </v>

1710
01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:04.700
<v Speaker 4>our diet and lifestyle overseas and now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1711
01:19:04.730 --> 01:19:08.720
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of like the latest installment</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the avengers,</v>

1712
01:19:08.721 --> 01:19:13.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're sending these fast food </v>

1713
01:19:13.721 --> 01:19:13.721
<v Speaker 4>restaurants to these places and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>having,</v>

1714
01:19:13.721 --> 01:19:16.670
<v Speaker 4>they're having and as the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ascension of the middle class in China,</v>

1715
01:19:16.690 --> 01:19:21.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>continues and they can afford to </v>

1716
01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:22.510
<v Speaker 4>purchase more meat products.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're having a heart problem.</v>

1717
01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:24.500
<v Speaker 4>They are having disease problems that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've,</v>

1718
01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:25.650
<v Speaker 4>they haven't seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1719
01:19:25.651 --> 01:19:27.920
<v Speaker 4>it's an unprecedented in the history of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their culture.</v>

1720
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:34.510
<v Speaker 3>So it seems also there's a real issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>with human beings when it comes to </v>

1721
01:19:34.510 --> 01:19:35.960
<v Speaker 3>patterns of behavior and habits that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1722
01:19:35.961 --> 01:19:38.290
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1723
01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:43.360
<v Speaker 3>like as you were saying before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you could have a day where you </v>

1724
01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:46.151
<v Speaker 3>could cheat that day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would become the habit and then it </v>

1725
01:19:46.151 --> 01:19:49.361
<v Speaker 3>would do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would be thinking about that one </v>

1726
01:19:49.361 --> 01:19:51.281
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's very hard for people who are </v>

1727
01:19:51.281 --> 01:19:53.261
<v Speaker 3>extremely obese who just their main form</v>
<v Speaker 3>of pleasure is pleasure.</v>

1728
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:59.470
<v Speaker 3>Of course they get that wired it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their face and then that's what that </v>

1729
01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:04.620
<v Speaker 3>whole fucking corndogs so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where they're getting their </v>

1730
01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:06.020
<v Speaker 3>pleasure from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to deviate from that.</v>

1731
01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:07.800
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to change your patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1732
01:20:07.930 --> 01:20:08.150
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1733
01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:13.260
<v Speaker 4>you are managing your emotional </v>
<v Speaker 4>wellbeing through the food choices that </v>

1734
01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:15.120
<v Speaker 4>you're making,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you make and they're putting on.</v>

1735
01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:20.880
<v Speaker 4>There's a great book called Salt Sugar </v>
<v Speaker 4>Fat by this guy called Michael Morris </v>

1736
01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:25.980
<v Speaker 4>and he kind of looks at these big food </v>
<v Speaker 4>companies and draws an analogy to the </v>

1737
01:20:26.531 --> 01:20:31.531
<v Speaker 4>tobacco companies in the seventies in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that these companies are </v>

1738
01:20:31.531 --> 01:20:36.061
<v Speaker 4>funneling money and research and </v>
<v Speaker 4>marketing dollars into devising food </v>

1739
01:20:36.581 --> 01:20:40.990
<v Speaker 4>products that are specifically designed </v>
<v Speaker 4>to activate that pleasure center in your</v>

1740
01:20:40.991 --> 01:20:42.100
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1741
01:20:42.101 --> 01:20:43.390
<v Speaker 4>So that they know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

1742
01:20:43.391 --> 01:20:47.080
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to make that food </v>
<v Speaker 4>impossible for you to just have one.</v>

1743
01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:51.340
<v Speaker 4>And once you kind of tap into that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that um,</v>

1744
01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:57.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to trigger that response in </v>

1745
01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.930
<v Speaker 4>somebody and you create a habit out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and addictive response.</v>

1746
01:20:58.990 --> 01:21:01.720
<v Speaker 4>Then you have a customer for life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1747
01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:02.440
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1748
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:04.990
<v Speaker 4>why is it so hard to eat one fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>chip?</v>

1749
01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.780
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a reason behind that.</v>

1750
01:21:07.781 --> 01:21:10.100
<v Speaker 4>There's something about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1751
01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:14.710
<v Speaker 4>the proportion of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of salt and grease,</v>

1752
01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:19.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that will just trigger something in </v>

1753
01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:19.740
<v Speaker 4>somebody.</v>

1754
01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:23.530
<v Speaker 5>Do know the feeling that you have when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you do indulge in some really shitty </v>

1755
01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:25.470
<v Speaker 5>food that you have just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ugh.</v>

1756
01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:28.110
<v Speaker 5>After it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you feel like such a loser.</v>

1757
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:33.450
<v Speaker 5>If I like a bag of chips,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go into a shame spiral.</v>

1758
01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:37.980
<v Speaker 5>I feel angry at myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking dummy ate a bag of chips.</v>

1759
01:21:37.981 --> 01:21:40.290
<v Speaker 5>I never went back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you're doing it,</v>

1760
01:21:40.291 --> 01:21:42.600
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't even help myself.</v>

1761
01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.830
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a greedy,</v>

1762
01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.870
<v Speaker 5>greedy monster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like um,</v>

1763
01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.310
<v Speaker 5>you know what I read?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a,</v>

1764
01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:50.820
<v Speaker 5>I have a real weakness for those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1765
01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:53.460
<v Speaker 5>salt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sea salt and vinegar potato chips.</v>

1766

01:21:58.380 --> 01:21:59.580
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're so good.</v>

1770

<v Speaker 5>GMO in the front.</v>

1771
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:03.720
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1774
01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:14.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't say those last a long time.</v>

1775
01:22:14.851 --> 01:22:18.480
<v Speaker 5>I think so we'll need to write.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1776
01:22:18.810 --> 01:22:21.150
<v Speaker 5>Storm hadn't been heading in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>direction though.</v>

1777
01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.150
<v Speaker 5>Do potato chips?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's my guilty pleasure.</v>

1778
01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:26.550
<v Speaker 5>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The kettle chips are tough.</v>

1779
01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:29.700
<v Speaker 5>Fucking real hard Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1780
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:34.500
<v Speaker 5>I try not to be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a friend is Vegan.</v>

1781

<v Speaker 5>He's fat as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1782
01:22:35.821 --> 01:22:40.821
<v Speaker 5>it's never been easier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's never been easier to be an </v>

1783
01:22:40.821 --> 01:22:43.221
<v Speaker 5>unhealthy Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean just walk the aisles at whole </v>

1784
01:22:43.221 --> 01:22:43.221
<v Speaker 5>foods or Erewhon like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1785
01:22:43.221 --> 01:22:47.120
<v Speaker 5>there's so many Vegan ice creams now and</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of meat alternatives and pasta </v>

1786
01:22:48.901 --> 01:22:50.520
<v Speaker 5>sauces that are tasty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1787
01:22:50.521 --> 01:22:54.060
<v Speaker 5>And say getty is totally Vegan and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>get it from the right place.</v>

1788
01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:55.070
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah.</v>

1789
01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:56.030
<v Speaker 4>Without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1790
01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:58.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's plenty of options now.</v>

1791
01:22:58.461 --> 01:23:02.070
<v Speaker 4>And so just because you're Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean that you're,</v>

1792
01:23:02.150 --> 01:23:04.190
<v Speaker 4>you're eating a healthy diet for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1793
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:05.470
<v Speaker 4>that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I for</v>

1794
01:23:05.710 --> 01:23:10.710
<v Speaker 3>people understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of people also that </v>

1795
01:23:10.710 --> 01:23:13.541
<v Speaker 3>think that drinking juice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking fruit juice is really good for </v>

1796
01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:13.790
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be careful about that folks,</v>

1797
01:23:13.791 --> 01:23:17.720
<v Speaker 3>because you're not supposed to drink </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a court of orange juice.</v>

1798
01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:23.260
<v Speaker 3>That's not how that juice is supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get to your body the way that juice is </v>

1799
01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:24.440
<v Speaker 3>supposed to get to your bodies by eating</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking orange.</v>

1800
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.280
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1801
01:23:25.281 --> 01:23:28.130
<v Speaker 3>When you drink like a pie quarter of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pineapple juice,</v>

1802
01:23:28.131 --> 01:23:33.131
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A fucking shock of sugar to your system </v>

1803
01:23:33.131 --> 01:23:34.340
<v Speaker 3>just because it's attached to fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we,</v>

1804
01:23:34.341 --> 01:23:37.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assume rightly so is healthy.</v>

1805
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Just have some goddamn fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drink some water while you having a big </v>

1806
01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:46.571
<v Speaker 3>plate of pineapple and you'll be way </v>
<v Speaker 3>better off than drinking pineapple </v>

1807
01:23:46.571 --> 01:23:46.571
<v Speaker 3>juice.</v>

1808
01:23:46.571 --> 01:23:47.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't agree with you more.</v>

1809
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:49.050
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about fiber.</v>

1810
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:51.240
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would you remove all the fiber?</v>

1811
01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:52.290
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On that plant.</v>

1812
01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.870
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think juicing has its place though,</v>

1813
01:23:54.871 --> 01:23:59.871
<v Speaker 4>but there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a huge difference between that </v>

1814
01:23:59.871 --> 01:24:01.740
<v Speaker 4>gallon of Tropicana at the grocery store</v>
<v Speaker 4>and cold pressing,</v>

1815
01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:06.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some Kale and spinach with some tumeric </v>

1816
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.770
<v Speaker 4>in it</v>

1817
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.770
<v Speaker 3>that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1818
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:07.580
<v Speaker 3>Like I think that the sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1819
01:24:07.890 --> 01:24:08.920
<v Speaker 3>sugar is the real issue</v>

1820
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:10.120
<v Speaker 4>you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1821
01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:15.600
<v Speaker 4>I look at it as medicinal and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like if you want a really </v>

1822
01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:17.360
<v Speaker 4>concentrated dose of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of uh,</v>

1823
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:20.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>micro nutrients and you know,</v>

1824
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:22.130
<v Speaker 4>the kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1825
01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.500
<v Speaker 4>highly compacted vitamins and minerals </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can get in some of these foods,</v>

1826
01:24:26.530 --> 01:24:29.560
<v Speaker 4>these plants than it has its place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1827
01:24:29.890 --> 01:24:30.860
<v Speaker 4>but to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1828
01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:34.020
<v Speaker 4>run 20 oranges through a juicer and </v>
<v Speaker 4>drink that you're,</v>

1829
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:39.030
<v Speaker 4>you're getting a huge amount of sugar in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and you're depriving yourself of </v>

1830
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:42.900
<v Speaker 4>the digestive process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the fiber that comes with just </v>

1831
01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:43.750
<v Speaker 4>eating the whole food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like nature figured it out,</v>

1832
01:24:43.751 --> 01:24:45.550
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why are you trying to,</v>

1833
01:24:45.551 --> 01:24:50.551
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like the more you focus on eating </v>

1834
01:24:50.551 --> 01:24:52.030
<v Speaker 4>these kinds of foods close to their </v>
<v Speaker 4>natural state,</v>

1835
01:24:52.031 --> 01:24:54.280
<v Speaker 4>your Palette changes and you start to </v>
<v Speaker 4>desire them.</v>

1836
01:24:54.281 --> 01:24:56.930
<v Speaker 4>Like I know these guys that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1837
01:24:57.130 --> 01:25:00.130
<v Speaker 4>that are fruitarian like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all they eat is fruit like this.</v>

1838
01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:01.450
<v Speaker 4>Their whole lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1839
01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:02.580
<v Speaker 4>It's called the 80 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10,</v>

1840
01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:04.150
<v Speaker 4>80 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 diet,</v>

1841
01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:07.780
<v Speaker 4>80 percent carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 percent protein,</v>

1842
01:25:07.781 --> 01:25:12.781
<v Speaker 4>10 percent fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But essentially what it means is they </v>

1843
01:25:12.781 --> 01:25:12.940
<v Speaker 4>eat fruit all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it totally raw.</v>

1844
01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:15.620
<v Speaker 4>They'll eat like 30 bananas a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heard.</v>

1845
01:25:16.050 --> 01:25:17.290
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1846
01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:18.850
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1847
01:25:18.851 --> 01:25:21.610
<v Speaker 4>somebody who is from that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Atkins,</v>

1848
01:25:21.611 --> 01:25:26.611
<v Speaker 4>Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>low carb camp will tell you that that's </v>

1849
01:25:26.611 --> 01:25:27.040
<v Speaker 4>an extremely unhealthy thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1850
01:25:27.041 --> 01:25:30.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a fruitarian I don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 4>direct experience with that.</v>

1851
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:32.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the longterm </v>
<v Speaker 4>ramifications of,</v>

1852
01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:38.010
<v Speaker 4>of living that lifestyle are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I do know people that live this way </v>

1853
01:25:38.770 --> 01:25:42.970
<v Speaker 4>and they're super healthy people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them are amazing athletes.</v>

1854
01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:46.120
<v Speaker 4>Like my friend Michael Arnstein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's fruitarian,</v>

1855
01:25:46.121 --> 01:25:47.890
<v Speaker 4>he has been forever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1856
01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:52.660
<v Speaker 4>and he was like the fifth fastest guide </v>
<v Speaker 4>than New York City Marathon not too many</v>

1857
01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:52.790
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1858
01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:55.780
<v Speaker 4>like an elite athlete who's eating this </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1859
01:25:55.890 --> 01:26:00.890
<v Speaker 4>that's literally he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has to eat so much fruit that he has </v>

1860
01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 4>like two giant extra refrigerators in </v>
<v Speaker 4>his house and he would have to drive</v>

1861
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:07.340
<v Speaker 2>this big truck to like a fruit wholesale</v>
<v Speaker 2>or once a week.</v>

1862
01:26:07.341 --> 01:26:12.341
<v Speaker 2>And like the guy at the wholesaler </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that he had like a bodega or </v>

1863
01:26:12.341 --> 01:26:15.541
<v Speaker 2>something like that because he couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe how much fruit this guy was </v>

1864
01:26:15.541 --> 01:26:15.541
<v Speaker 2>buying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1865
01:26:15.541 --> 01:26:17.090
<v Speaker 2>one of the UFC fighters you'd like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are there.</v>

1866
01:26:17.091 --> 01:26:18.480
<v Speaker 2>I believe Nate Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like that.</v>

1867
01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I think he's on the 30 bananas a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1868
01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1869
01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:22.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1870
01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.070
<v Speaker 2>but that didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got his ass kicked.</v>

1871
01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mac,</v>

1872
01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Mac Dansik was playing around with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>for awhile.</v>

1873
01:26:28.130 --> 01:26:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's still on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people that I've talked to who have </v>

1874
01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:36.820
<v Speaker 2>like dabbled in it say that when they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it they feel amazing and his </v>

1875
01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:39.940
<v Speaker 2>people are trim and they don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not getting diabetes and </v>

1876
01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:43.301
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting a tremendous amount of </v>

1877
01:26:43.301 --> 01:26:45.011
<v Speaker 2>glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're also getting a huge amount of </v>

1878
01:26:45.011 --> 01:26:45.260
<v Speaker 2>fiber and they're still meeting their </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein needs.</v>

1879
01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:47.840
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I look at that,</v>

1880
01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:52.900
<v Speaker 2>it just makes me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives me a different perspective on </v>

1881
01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:54.260
<v Speaker 2>this obsession that we have with </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein.</v>

1882
01:26:54.261 --> 01:26:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone's walking around worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1883
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:57.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting their protein needs.</v>

1884
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:59.210
<v Speaker 2>And the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

1885
01:26:59.230 --> 01:27:04.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the average semi sedentary person is </v>

1886
01:27:04.230 --> 01:27:07.070
<v Speaker 2>eating two to five times the recommended</v>
<v Speaker 2>daily allowance of protein.</v>

1887
01:27:07.071 --> 01:27:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a nonissue.</v>

1888
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:11.090
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of a red herring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should clarify that.</v>

1889
01:27:11.091 --> 01:27:16.091
<v Speaker 2>Nate Diaz was probably injured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was something wrong with </v>

1890
01:27:16.091 --> 01:27:16.580
<v Speaker 2>him in his last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have nothing to do with his diet.</v>

1891
01:27:16.581 --> 01:27:18.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm just fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1892
01:27:18.261 --> 01:27:21.080
<v Speaker 2>he also fought Hoffeld dose on Joe's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the best fighters in the</v>

1893
01:27:21.081 --> 01:27:23.450
<v Speaker 2>world is the current champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his diet,</v>

1894
01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it had nothing to do with him </v>
<v Speaker 2>losing,</v>

1895
01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:30.400
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a higher dietary requirements </v>

1896
01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.581
<v Speaker 2>of protein for people that like say </v>
<v Speaker 2>competing power lifting or things along </v>

1897
01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:33.581
<v Speaker 2>those lines?</v>

1898
01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:34.910
<v Speaker 2>And are there any power lifters that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegan?</v>

1899
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:39.440
<v Speaker 2>There is a guy called Patrick Baboon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mian.</v>

1900
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:41.840
<v Speaker 2>He's German dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>German strong man.</v>

1901
01:27:41.841 --> 01:27:44.840
<v Speaker 2>This dude is the human wolverine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's insane.</v>

1902
01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:47.660
<v Speaker 2>And I had that privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a youtube video of it.</v>

1903
01:27:47.661 --> 01:27:49.330
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you guys can pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1904
01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:51.320
<v Speaker 2>I was on stage with him at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1905
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:56.350
<v Speaker 2>an event in Toronto a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago where he attempted to break a </v>

1906
01:27:56.350 --> 01:28:00.461
<v Speaker 2>Guinness Book of world record by being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by carrying more weight than any other </v>

1907
01:28:00.461 --> 01:28:04.220
<v Speaker 2>human being ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put 1200 pounds on a chassis that he</v>

1908
01:28:04.221 --> 01:28:09.221
<v Speaker 2>carried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had to carry it 10 meters and he </v>

1909
01:28:09.221 --> 01:28:09.440
<v Speaker 2>accomplished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was extraordinary.</v>

1910
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:11.720
<v Speaker 2>And the guys totally Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1916
01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:23.680

<v Speaker 2>he's going to be aquaman.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I to tell you I met one of the guys that</v>
<v Speaker 2>works at Tri caster.</v>

1925
01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:45.530
<v Speaker 2>We're hooked up.</v>

1926
01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Twelve hundred pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1927
01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:51.080
<v Speaker 2>Why does it not look at that dark that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have 1200 DPI?</v>

1928
01:28:51.090 --> 01:28:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Definitely is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were all these people that are </v>

1929
01:28:56.090 --> 01:28:57.461
<v Speaker 2>verifying it and they had all this shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't seem like it's 1200 pounds.</v>

1930
01:28:57.711 --> 01:29:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Why is that a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does that look so light?</v>

1931
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:02.930
<v Speaker 2>I assure you that it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you a day.</v>

1932
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:04.740
<v Speaker 2>That's like 50 pounds.</v>

1933
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys get graded on a scale?</v>

1934
01:29:08.131 --> 01:29:13.131
<v Speaker 2>Because he's Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's not really 1240 minutes </v>

1935
01:29:13.131 --> 01:29:13.780
<v Speaker 2>talking about sounds like dog years </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegan.</v>

1936
01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Twelve hundred pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is 120 pounds.</v>

1937
01:29:16.171 --> 01:29:17.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's enormous.</v>

1938
01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:19.940
<v Speaker 2>That guy's fucking giant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so whatever it is,</v>

1939
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:22.380
<v Speaker 2>that guy got all that muscle from being </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Vegan.</v>

1940
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:23.750
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a bull.</v>

1941
01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Ballsy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Granted he,</v>

1942
01:29:25.150 --> 01:29:27.450
<v Speaker 2>he hasn't been a Vegan his entire life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1943
01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:30.150
<v Speaker 2>so it's not like he was reared that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he's been,</v>

1944
01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:33.870
<v Speaker 2>he's been that way long enough and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>will tell you that his strength training</v>

1945
01:29:33.871 --> 01:29:38.871
<v Speaker 2>improved and his agility and his ability</v>
<v Speaker 2>to recover a was significantly enhanced </v>

1946
01:29:38.871 --> 01:29:42.930
<v Speaker 2>when you changed it to the mountain </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand year old weightlifting record.</v>

1947
01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:47.640
<v Speaker 2>He put this huge log on his back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's enormous.</v>

1948
01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1949
01:29:49.631 --> 01:29:51.720
<v Speaker 2>At different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a different animal,</v>

1950
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:56.750
<v Speaker 2>especially Iceland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about Iceland </v>

1951
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:57.750
<v Speaker 2>diversity advice piece on Iceland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the strong men of Iceland.</v>

1952
01:29:58.190 --> 01:30:03.190
<v Speaker 2>The vice did a whole video on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like apparently the people in Iceland </v>

1953
01:30:03.190 --> 01:30:07.161
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a long history of being like </v>

1954
01:30:07.161 --> 01:30:07.830
<v Speaker 2>strong men competitors for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

1955
01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:12.240
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking giant dudes out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>form vikings or something.</v>

1956
01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>

1957
01:30:13.650 --> 01:30:15.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think to your point,</v>

1958
01:30:15.421 --> 01:30:18.900
<v Speaker 2>and your question was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that somebody who's of that</v>

1959
01:30:18.901 --> 01:30:23.901
<v Speaker 2>ilk or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a power lifter or a strength </v>

1960
01:30:23.901 --> 01:30:23.901
<v Speaker 2>athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if their.</v>

1961
01:30:23.901 --> 01:30:24.660
<v Speaker 2>If their protein requirements are are </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher,</v>

1962
01:30:26.110 --> 01:30:31.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that Patrick supplements with </v>

1963
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.260
<v Speaker 2>plant based protein powders from time to</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1964
01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:34.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1965
01:30:34.530 --> 01:30:38.940
<v Speaker 2>he probably is taking in somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>between 80 to 100 grams a day.</v>

1966
01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:40.780
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1967
01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:42.480
<v Speaker 2>like pre P,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brown rice,</v>

1968
01:30:42.481 --> 01:30:44.160
<v Speaker 2>hemp protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hemp protein.</v>

1969
01:30:44.161 --> 01:30:47.580
<v Speaker 2>I think it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm complete amino acid profile.</v>

1970
01:30:47.581 --> 01:30:51.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean essentially look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated,</v>

1971
01:30:51.001 --> 01:30:51.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1972
01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:55.890
<v Speaker 2>we can't be reductionist about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the most general sense when we're</v>

1973
01:30:55.891 --> 01:30:58.890
<v Speaker 2>talking about protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about amino acids,</v>

1974
01:30:58.891 --> 01:31:03.891
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about the building blocks </v>

1975
01:31:03.891 --> 01:31:05.661
<v Speaker 2>of protein and we're specifically </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the nine slash amino </v>

1976
01:31:05.661 --> 01:31:09.531
<v Speaker 2>acids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the essential amino acids that we can't </v>

1977
01:31:09.531 --> 01:31:09.810
<v Speaker 2>synthesize on around that we have to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the foods that we eat.</v>

1978
01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1979
01:31:10.770 --> 01:31:15.770
<v Speaker 2>so it's a question of making sure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we are ingesting those nine essential </v>

1980
01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:16.950
<v Speaker 2>amino acids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1981
01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:20.400
<v Speaker 2>So does it matter where they come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In what form?</v>

1982
01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:21.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1983
01:31:21.381 --> 01:31:26.381
<v Speaker 2>they are delivered to your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it matter if it's in hemp or if </v>

1984
01:31:26.381 --> 01:31:26.381
<v Speaker 2>it's in steak?</v>

1985
01:31:28.810 --> 01:31:29.320
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1986
01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:29.980
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1987
01:31:29.981 --> 01:31:31.780
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I can tell you is that,</v>

1988
01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:34.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I seem to be doing okay with it,</v>

1989
01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:39.540
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can just share my experience with </v>

1990
01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:39.540
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

1991
01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:39.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's um,</v>

1992
01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:44.700
<v Speaker 2>there was an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Travis Barker was in that plane </v>

1993
01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:44.700
<v Speaker 2>crash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that story?</v>

1994
01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Barker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the drummer?</v>

1995
01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1996
01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:49.930
<v Speaker 2>I've seen the juicy ladies all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in the neighborhood.</v>

1997
01:31:50.170 --> 01:31:50.920
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1998
01:31:51.130 --> 01:31:56.130
<v Speaker 2>he was in a plane crash and had to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>skin grafts and got off of his Vegan </v>

1999
01:31:57.190 --> 01:32:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Diet because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he having a hard time healing and </v>

2000
01:32:02.190 --> 01:32:02.710
<v Speaker 2>the starting to me and he healed much </v>
<v Speaker 2>quicker.</v>

2001
01:32:03.250 --> 01:32:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2002
01:32:03.921 --> 01:32:05.800
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2003
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:08.230
<v Speaker 2>but that's pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's pretty sure he's,</v>

2004
01:32:08.290 --> 01:32:09.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2005
01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:10.900
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's pretty hardcore Vegan.</v>

2006
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:13.600
<v Speaker 2>He's partner in that restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 2>crossroads.</v>

2007
01:32:13.601 --> 01:32:14.440
<v Speaker 2>Have you been a crossroads?</v>

2008
01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Where does that phenomenal restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurants and it's in Hollywood.</v>

2009
01:32:18.791 --> 01:32:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's Tal Ronen who's the chef.</v>

2010
01:32:21.311 --> 01:32:26.311
<v Speaker 2>There is a mastermind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a genius in the food is </v>

2011
01:32:26.311 --> 01:32:26.311
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should check it out.</v>

2012
01:32:26.311 --> 01:32:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2013
01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just stating what I heard,</v>

2014
01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:34.300
<v Speaker 2>what I read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about him after the </v>

2015
01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:34.300
<v Speaker 2>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't heard that.</v>

2016
01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Is there any properties that would exist</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2017
01:32:36.231 --> 01:32:41.231
<v Speaker 2>in flesh and blood and eating meat that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would somehow or another benefit you </v>

2018
01:32:41.231 --> 01:32:43.180
<v Speaker 2>recovering from an injury?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

2019
01:32:43.690 --> 01:32:44.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2020
01:32:44.411 --> 01:32:46.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2021
01:32:46.181 --> 01:32:48.280
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would expedite that process.</v>

2022
01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:53.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference between the way I </v>

2023
01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:56.641
<v Speaker 2>feel when I eat like wild game versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way I feel when I eat steak that's </v>

2024
01:32:57.581 --> 01:33:00.520
<v Speaker 2>like raised factory rails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steak or whatever.</v>

2025
01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:03.700
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference in the way your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body reacts to it.</v>

2026
01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Your body has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

2027
01:33:05.351 --> 01:33:06.430
<v Speaker 2>there's a feeling that you eat.</v>

2028
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Especially Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moose is very unusual for whatever </v>

2029
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.680
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you eat moose you get this,</v>

2030
01:33:11.681 --> 01:33:13.720
<v Speaker 2>like you almost feel like it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulant.</v>

2031
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:16.390
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you eat rare,</v>

2032
01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:17.710
<v Speaker 2>cause heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it rare.</v>

2033
01:33:17.711 --> 01:33:21.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a very lean and there was this </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird like woo,</v>

2034
01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:26.580
<v Speaker 2>like you get a charge after it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very similar to what I get when I eat </v>

2035
01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:31.171
<v Speaker 2>kale shakes when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I Kale shake some of the things </v>

2036
01:33:31.171 --> 01:33:32.200
<v Speaker 2>that I tell people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to change your diet,</v>

2037
01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:35.470
<v Speaker 2>like here's one of the best ways to eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>something healthy,</v>

2038
01:33:35.471 --> 01:33:37.690
<v Speaker 2>get a positive reaction from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to repeat it,</v>

2039
01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:42.960
<v Speaker 2>and one of the best positive reactions </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever gotten is I drink these Kale </v>

2040
01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:45.010
<v Speaker 2>shakes in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called them hoke loads,</v>

2041
01:33:45.011 --> 01:33:48.730
<v Speaker 2>so I talk about all the time it's Kale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cucumber,</v>

2042
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:52.540
<v Speaker 2>celery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a large chunk of ginger,</v>

2043
01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:55.900
<v Speaker 2>a four cloves of garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coconut oil,</v>

2044
01:33:56.020 --> 01:34:01.020
<v Speaker 2>and an apple blend that sucker up </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and there is a nutrient blast </v>

2045
01:34:01.421 --> 01:34:03.370
<v Speaker 2>that you get in there that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tangible,</v>

2046
01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:06.530
<v Speaker 2>a stimulant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a feeling like I get,</v>

2047
01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:07.990
<v Speaker 2>I feel stimulant.</v>

2048
01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll get it done.</v>

2049
01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2050
01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:12.700
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I say to people all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2051
01:34:12.701 --> 01:34:14.080
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2052
01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:19.081
<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about whether you're gonna </v>

2053
01:34:19.081 --> 01:34:20.050
<v Speaker 2>do this all the way or what you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do tomorrow.</v>

2054
01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Just like wake up and drink that salad </v>
<v Speaker 2>for breakfast and make that connection </v>

2055
01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:28.630
<v Speaker 2>with how you feel because truly nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>will make you feel better in the morning</v>

2056
01:34:28.930 --> 01:34:33.310
<v Speaker 2>than drinking a super nutrient dense </v>
<v Speaker 2>green shake.</v>

2057
01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:34.500
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2058
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:36.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it has,</v>

2059
01:34:36.161 --> 01:34:37.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have variations on a theme,</v>

2060
01:34:37.931 --> 01:34:42.931
<v Speaker 2>like I do something similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit different and it's </v>

2061
01:34:42.931 --> 01:34:42.931
<v Speaker 2>never the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2062
01:34:42.931 --> 01:34:42.931
<v Speaker 2>I changed it from day to day or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2063
01:34:42.931 --> 01:34:45.460
<v Speaker 2>but once you make that connection and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2064
01:34:45.490 --> 01:34:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2065
01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:50.740
<v Speaker 2>then that starts to change the microbial</v>
<v Speaker 2>ecology in your gut.</v>

2066
01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting,</v>

2067
01:34:52.931 --> 01:34:53.200
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2068
01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:53.950
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

2069
01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:55.960
<v Speaker 2>and I think we talked about this last </v>
<v Speaker 2>time too,</v>

2070
01:34:55.961 --> 01:35:00.961
<v Speaker 2>like all these studies that are coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>out about how important your microbiome </v>

2071
01:35:00.961 --> 01:35:04.880
<v Speaker 2>is to all kinds of things that impact </v>
<v Speaker 2>your health and,</v>

2072
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:09.910
<v Speaker 2>and how and how there's some evidence to</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggest that the quality of your gut </v>

2073
01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:11.860
<v Speaker 2>biome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2074
01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:14.000
<v Speaker 2>can impact your cravings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2075
01:35:14.010 --> 01:35:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2076
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:16.310
<v Speaker 2>So sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have,</v>

2077
01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:18.500
<v Speaker 2>that's a real issue with sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when people say,</v>

2078
01:35:18.501 --> 01:35:19.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just crave this,</v>

2079
01:35:19.581 --> 01:35:21.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body's telling me that I need it.</v>

2080
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not an objective analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2081
01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:29.051
<v Speaker 2>Just because you crave something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean that your body needs it in </v>

2082
01:35:29.051 --> 01:35:29.970
<v Speaker 2>my own interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it does,</v>

2083
01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:31.970
<v Speaker 2>but if I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2084
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.880
<v Speaker 2>exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you discern between the two?</v>

2085
01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting point.</v>

2086
01:35:37.050 --> 01:35:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

2087
01:35:37.611 --> 01:35:42.611
<v Speaker 2>that's absolutely a fact when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a gut microbes when it comes to </v>

2088
01:35:42.611 --> 01:35:45.170
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you feed those microbes a lot of</v>

2089
01:35:45.171 --> 01:35:50.171
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become dependent upon it and they </v>

2090
01:35:50.171 --> 01:35:50.171
<v Speaker 2>need it to survive.</v>

2091
01:35:50.171 --> 01:35:50.410
<v Speaker 2>And so they're impulsing you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need more of that.</v>

2092
01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Then you're in this cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they analyze the gut biome of people </v>

2093
01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.920
<v Speaker 2>that are like Chocoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2094
01:35:57.921 --> 01:36:01.010
<v Speaker 2>And it was very different from people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are ambivalent about chocolate.</v>

2095
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:05.390
<v Speaker 2>That's such a bizarre thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have these organisms living inside</v>

2096
01:36:05.391 --> 01:36:10.150
<v Speaker 2>your intestinal track that are actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing the way you crave things.</v>

2097
01:36:10.151 --> 01:36:15.151
<v Speaker 2>So they're sending some sort of stimulus</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gets to your brain and it's </v>

2098
01:36:15.151 --> 01:36:16.330
<v Speaker 2>altering the way you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2099
01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:18.770
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want food in your body.</v>

2100
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an assault to your idea that you </v>

2101
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:24.200
<v Speaker 2>are essentially human being who is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>control of your thoughts.</v>

2102
01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:28.650
<v Speaker 2>And then that leads to the question of </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher consciousness versus you know,</v>

2103
01:36:28.651 --> 01:36:30.230
<v Speaker 2>the sort of looping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2104
01:36:30.231 --> 01:36:34.490
<v Speaker 2>kind of a thing that your brain can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2105
01:36:34.491 --> 01:36:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Like what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2106
01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:40.130
<v Speaker 2>when you observe your own thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it that your who's The observer,</v>

2107
01:36:40.190 --> 01:36:41.640
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2108
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:46.750
<v Speaker 2>so you know what I mean?</v>

2109
01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're having a dream and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a conversation with somebody in a</v>

2110
01:36:52.581 --> 01:36:55.250
<v Speaker 2>dream and you're surprised at what </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody tells you,</v>

2111
01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:57.830
<v Speaker 2>but you're imagining that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2112
01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because you didn't know in your dream</v>

2113
01:37:01.131 --> 01:37:02.990
<v Speaker 2>that that person was going to say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to you,</v>

2114
01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:05.180
<v Speaker 2>but on some level obviously you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2115
01:37:05.181 --> 01:37:08.840
<v Speaker 2>that's the complex nuances of Caruso for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2116
01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:13.930
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the complex nuances of just </v>

2117
01:37:13.930 --> 01:37:13.930
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2118
01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that there could be microbes in</v>

2119
01:37:17.121 --> 01:37:21.050
<v Speaker 2>your body that are stimulating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing the way your brain functions is</v>

2120
01:37:21.051 --> 01:37:23.460
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems so alien to people because we</v>

2121
01:37:23.461 --> 01:37:25.460
<v Speaker 2>like to think of ourselves as </v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomous.</v>

2122
01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we're not,</v>

2123
01:37:26.601 --> 01:37:27.100
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2124
01:37:27.190 --> 01:37:30.050
<v Speaker 2>we're far more microbes than human </v>
<v Speaker 2>whamming the percentage.</v>

2125
01:37:30.051 --> 01:37:31.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember what the percentage is,</v>

2126
01:37:31.701 --> 01:37:32.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2127
01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:34.100
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number of,</v>

2128
01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:38.570
<v Speaker 2>of microorganisms like trumps the number</v>
<v Speaker 2>of cells you have in your body by like a</v>

2129
01:37:38.571 --> 01:37:39.590
<v Speaker 2>factor of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2130
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:44.910
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's 10 or something </v>

2131
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:46.661
<v Speaker 2>crazy where there's more eco lie living </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your gut than there have ever been </v>

2132
01:37:46.661 --> 01:37:48.300
<v Speaker 2>people ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2133
01:37:48.710 --> 01:37:50.240
<v Speaker 2>that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are real numbers.</v>

2134
01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:51.950
<v Speaker 2>There's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

2135
01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:53.120
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2136
01:37:53.121 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a healthy symbiotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with</v>

2137
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:56.610
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2138
01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:59.010
<v Speaker 3>Like you need it to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's part of being healthy.</v>

2139
01:37:59.190 --> 01:38:00.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about this,</v>

2140
01:38:00.571 --> 01:38:05.571
<v Speaker 3>I believe last time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>various forms of probiotics that you </v>

2141
01:38:05.571 --> 01:38:05.571
<v Speaker 3>engage in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sauerkraut,</v>

2142
01:38:05.630 --> 01:38:07.470
<v Speaker 3>I think you said one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kimchi,</v>

2143
01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:08.580
<v Speaker 3>Kimchi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Kimchi.</v>

2144
01:38:08.610 --> 01:38:10.290
<v Speaker 3>Kimchi is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love that stuff.</v>

2145
01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:12.040
<v Speaker 3>Come up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife fucking hates it.</v>

2146
01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:14.040
<v Speaker 3>Says it makes me smell tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

2147
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:15.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kombucha.</v>

2148
01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.130
<v Speaker 3>I love that stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2149
01:38:17.131 --> 01:38:19.100
<v Speaker 3>it pisses me off man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fucking.</v>

2150
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:24.000
<v Speaker 3>That a gts Kombucha had to pull the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the really good stuff and put that water</v>

2151
01:38:24.001 --> 01:38:27.990
<v Speaker 3>down horseshit because it's more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>one half of one percent alcohol.</v>

2152
01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:32.730
<v Speaker 3>The fermentation process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Microbes tiny trace of fermentation that</v>

2153
01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:37.940
<v Speaker 3>like left a little bit of alcohol in it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that caused this whole thing and they </v>

2154
01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:37.940
<v Speaker 3>had to pull it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to pull everything.</v>

2155
01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:40.410
<v Speaker 3>We started a state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We started making our own.</v>

2156
01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:43.530
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever made your own gas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it just so you have the big scoby.</v>

2157
01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:46.440
<v Speaker 3>I've been in a Kombucha drinker since </v>
<v Speaker 3>94.</v>

2158
01:38:47.050 --> 01:38:51.480
<v Speaker 3>When I started drinking it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Andy Dick turned me onto it and Andy</v>

2159
01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:54.870
<v Speaker 3>Dick gave me a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a slab of Kombucha,</v>

2160
01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:59.920
<v Speaker 3>a fungus to take home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I got a bowl and I started brewing </v>

2161
01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:04.341
<v Speaker 3>it in my refrigerator and a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Oj that was long before.</v>

2162
01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:06.240
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gts or anybody.</v>

2163
01:39:06.730 --> 01:39:07.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't buy it.</v>

2164
01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:08.650
<v Speaker 3>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2165
01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:13.700
<v Speaker 3>I used to have a bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a huge salad bowl in my frigerator </v>

2166
01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:16.590
<v Speaker 3>with a fucking living fungus in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would have the Saran wrap on it.</v>

2167
01:39:16.591 --> 01:39:21.591
<v Speaker 3>There was sugar and stuff in the bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what was the ingredients were </v>

2168
01:39:21.591 --> 01:39:25.130
<v Speaker 3>and it would feed off of that and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would leave it in there for a certain </v>

2169
01:39:25.130 --> 01:39:25.130
<v Speaker 3>amount of time and then pour it into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>glass and drink it.</v>

2170
01:39:25.130 --> 01:39:29.330
<v Speaker 3>It's great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was too much of a pain in the </v>

2171
01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:31.251
<v Speaker 3>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm somewhere in the late </v>

2172
01:39:31.251 --> 01:39:34.851
<v Speaker 3>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started finding it in stores and then </v>

2173
01:39:34.851 --> 01:39:36.130
<v Speaker 3>I got into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now I have a bunch here.</v>

2174
01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:37.050
<v Speaker 3>It's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2175
01:39:37.051 --> 01:39:38.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2176
01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:41.910
<v Speaker 3>I drink it every day and when I go on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the road,</v>

2177
01:39:42.230 --> 01:39:47.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the times I'll find a whole </v>

2178
01:39:47.230 --> 01:39:49.631
<v Speaker 3>foods and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll stock up on it and leave it in my </v>

2179
01:39:49.631 --> 01:39:49.860
<v Speaker 3>hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probiotics or.</v>

2180
01:39:49.861 --> 01:39:52.680
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very rarely sick.</v>

2181
01:39:52.710 --> 01:39:57.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean very rarely and I travel a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things that I attribute </v>

2182
01:39:57.710 --> 01:40:00.300
<v Speaker 3>that to is probiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that you really,</v>

2183
01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:05.600
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the unsung heroes of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>immune system that people don't take </v>

2184
01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:09.090
<v Speaker 3>into consideration the symbiotic </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship that we have with all these</v>

2185
01:40:09.091 --> 01:40:11.430
<v Speaker 3>weird microorganisms that you ingest.</v>

2186
01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:17.020
<v Speaker 3>And the more of those you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less deficits you have a in terms of</v>

2187
01:40:17.881 --> 01:40:22.881
<v Speaker 3>your nutritional intake and the more I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>more positive microbes and positive bio </v>

2188
01:40:24.090 --> 01:40:29.090
<v Speaker 3>organisms that you take into your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you're going to have the whole </v>

2189
01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:30.660
<v Speaker 3>system is going to function better and </v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to fight off immune or fight off</v>

2190
01:40:31.050 --> 01:40:31.980
<v Speaker 3>disease better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2191
01:40:31.981 --> 01:40:34.320
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The example that I always give,</v>

2192
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:36.660
<v Speaker 3>I think I might've shared this last </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

2193
01:40:36.661 --> 01:40:41.661
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if we did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the last time was a long time </v>

2194
01:40:41.661 --> 01:40:41.661
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably nobody saw that anyway,</v>

2195
01:40:41.661 --> 01:40:41.670
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2196
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:43.470
<v Speaker 3>the example that I always give is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2197
01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:46.890
<v Speaker 3>is from supersize me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Morgan spurlock documentary where he</v>

2198
01:40:46.891 --> 01:40:49.410
<v Speaker 3>decides he's going to eat Mcdonald's for</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 days straight.</v>

2199
01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:52.360
<v Speaker 3>And for people that saw the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2200
01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:53.990
<v Speaker 3>you might remember that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2201
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.680
<v Speaker 4>a couple of days in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into this experiment,</v>

2202
01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:58.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just,</v>

2203
01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:00.430
<v Speaker 4>he can't imagine how he's going to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>it through 30 days.</v>

2204
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:05.950
<v Speaker 4>And there's that scene where he's in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>car and he actually vomited out the </v>

2205
01:41:05.950 --> 01:41:06.250
<v Speaker 4>window after he drinks a milkshake or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

2206
01:41:06.251 --> 01:41:07.540
<v Speaker 4>And you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the worst.</v>

2207
01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:13.440
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then fast forward like two weeks </v>

2208
01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.511
<v Speaker 4>later and there's a scene where he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like waking up in the morning and he's </v>

2209
01:41:15.511 --> 01:41:15.630
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2210
01:41:15.670 --> 01:41:17.530
<v Speaker 4>I feel so sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2211
01:41:17.531 --> 01:41:19.300
<v Speaker 4>I feel terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2212
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:21.130
<v Speaker 4>let's go to Mcdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2213
01:41:21.131 --> 01:41:23.500
<v Speaker 4>for his breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he eats,</v>

2214
01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:26.740
<v Speaker 4>he eats his whatever he ate for </v>
<v Speaker 4>breakfast at Mcdonald's that morning.</v>

2215
01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.900
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he walks out and he's like,</v>

2216
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:30.760
<v Speaker 4>I feel awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2217
01:41:30.761 --> 01:41:35.140
<v Speaker 4>like he had to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he had to get his fix.</v>

2218
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:37.600
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2219
01:41:37.630 --> 01:41:41.680
<v Speaker 4>what I see in that is somebody whose </v>
<v Speaker 4>microbiome has adjusted,</v>

2220
01:41:42.130 --> 01:41:46.690
<v Speaker 4>he has replaced because at the time his </v>
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend,</v>

2221
01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a Vegan chef,</v>

2222
01:41:48.311 --> 01:41:53.311
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he was coming off of eating </v>

2223
01:41:53.311 --> 01:41:53.500
<v Speaker 4>essentially a plant based diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It goes into this Mcdonald's thing.</v>

2224
01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:58.780
<v Speaker 4>And by virtue of bombarding his system </v>
<v Speaker 4>with Mcdonald's food,</v>

2225
01:41:59.090 --> 01:42:00.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he reap,</v>

2226
01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:06.060
<v Speaker 4>he repopulates his gut biome with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of micro organisms that feed off </v>

2227
01:42:06.221 --> 01:42:07.510
<v Speaker 4>Mcdonald's food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2228
01:42:07.511 --> 01:42:08.770
<v Speaker 4>So suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2229
01:42:08.771 --> 01:42:10.870
<v Speaker 4>because those microorganisms are on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>food that you're eating,</v>

2230
01:42:10.871 --> 01:42:15.871
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they feed into your gut and </v>

2231
01:42:15.871 --> 01:42:17.521
<v Speaker 4>then they start to propagate and </v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly he's craving these foods that </v>

2232
01:42:17.521 --> 01:42:21.900
<v Speaker 4>were making him sick two weeks earlier </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he couldn't imagine continuing to </v>

2233
01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:21.900
<v Speaker 4>eat.</v>

2234
01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:26.400
<v Speaker 3>That's the weirdest thing about died is </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're essentially creating a </v>

2235
01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.920
<v Speaker 3>civilization in your body and the trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

2236
01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:31.180
<v Speaker 3>It really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're,</v>

2237
01:42:31.181 --> 01:42:32.620
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2238
01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:35.620
<v Speaker 3>you're a super organism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are a container</v>

2239
01:42:35.630 --> 01:42:38.150
<v Speaker 4>and human beings are the microbiome of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the planet,</v>

2240
01:42:38.850 --> 01:42:39.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2241
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a good sign that our earth</v>

2242
01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:46.030
<v Speaker 3>is sick when you check out.</v>

2243
01:42:46.370 --> 01:42:49.810
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An unhealthy gut bacteria for the planet</v>

2244
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:52.070
<v Speaker 3>in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean really is.</v>

2245
01:42:52.071 --> 01:42:57.071
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like everything behaves in </v>

2246
01:42:57.071 --> 01:42:59.360
<v Speaker 3>this sort of fractal manner where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2247
01:42:59.370 --> 01:43:03.750
<v Speaker 3>the bigger you get like a main and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth itself is probably,</v>

2248
01:43:03.751 --> 01:43:08.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a microbe in the greater sense of the </v>

2249
01:43:08.751 --> 01:43:11.381
<v Speaker 3>galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a micro and a greater sense of </v>

2250
01:43:11.381 --> 01:43:14.171
<v Speaker 3>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's all sort of connected in some </v>

2251
01:43:14.171 --> 01:43:16.781
<v Speaker 3>weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that the lower you get down to gut </v>

2252
01:43:16.781 --> 01:43:20.111
<v Speaker 3>microbes and how you fuel those gut </v>
<v Speaker 3>microbes and how it impacts the health </v>

2253
01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:24.980
<v Speaker 3>of the actual super organism itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The human being as a really fascinating.</v>

2254
01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:26.540
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

2255
01:43:26.541 --> 01:43:31.541
<v Speaker 3>When you stop and think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because very few people think of </v>

2256
01:43:31.541 --> 01:43:33.350
<v Speaker 3>themselves as being a host for life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I am just this.</v>

2257
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:35.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to keep my garden </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy.</v>

2258
01:43:36.170 --> 01:43:38.450
<v Speaker 3>You know the garden of my body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is filled.</v>

2259
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:39.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think of it.</v>

2260
01:43:39.171 --> 01:43:41.810
<v Speaker 3>I am rich roll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am this one.</v>

2261
01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.490
<v Speaker 3>I am the one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am one.</v>

2262
01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:45.320
<v Speaker 3>I am one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're not.</v>

2263
01:43:45.321 --> 01:43:50.321
<v Speaker 3>No one is one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the brain thinks it's one thing </v>

2264
01:43:50.321 --> 01:43:51.110
<v Speaker 3>which is a fucker man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a weird.</v>

2265
01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:53.630
<v Speaker 3>That your brain doesn't realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2266
01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:54.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2267
01:43:55.040 --> 01:44:00.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting all these signals to eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mcdonald's because I've got all these </v>

2268
01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:03.671
<v Speaker 3>weird asshole Mcdonald's bacteria living</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my gut and what I need to do,</v>

2269
01:44:03.801 --> 01:44:08.801
<v Speaker 3>I need to get some cucumber bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 3>down in there to fuck with the </v>

2270
01:44:08.801 --> 01:44:10.520
<v Speaker 3>McDonald's bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very.</v>

2271
01:44:10.521 --> 01:44:15.521
<v Speaker 3>It's a very fascinating thing to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human being and to be completely </v>

2272
01:44:15.521 --> 01:44:19.421
<v Speaker 3>disconnected from that reality without </v>
<v Speaker 3>externally taking it in,</v>

2273
01:44:20.021 --> 01:44:25.021
<v Speaker 3>in the form of education and knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then having to internalize it,</v>

2274
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:26.630
<v Speaker 3>having to think about and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2275
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:30.320
<v Speaker 3>I need to take into consideration that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>am not just a one,</v>

2276
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:35.590
<v Speaker 3>I am a container for all these different</v>
<v Speaker 3>organisms and the the amount of positive</v>

2277
01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:41.330
<v Speaker 3>organisms will directly affect the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain works.</v>

2278
01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:44.720
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hard to think,</v>

2279
01:44:44.721 --> 01:44:45.620
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hard to.</v>

2280
01:44:45.650 --> 01:44:46.760
<v Speaker 3>Hard to wrap your head around.</v>

2281
01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Then factor in the emotional override </v>
<v Speaker 2>that takes over,</v>

2282
01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:57.490
<v Speaker 2>that compels you to take an action </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrespective of the logical choice after</v>

2283
01:44:57.491 --> 01:45:01.150
<v Speaker 2>you've been educated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's equally as powerful,</v>

2284
01:45:01.151 --> 01:45:02.230
<v Speaker 2>if not more powerful.</v>

2285
01:45:02.530 --> 01:45:03.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

2286
01:45:03.610 --> 01:45:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Oftentimes that can be adjust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that can be adjusted with momentum.</v>

2287
01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:13.560
<v Speaker 3>If you can just just fucking force </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself into a pattern that's more </v>

2288
01:45:13.841 --> 01:45:15.730
<v Speaker 3>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just somehow or another say,</v>

2289
01:45:15.731 --> 01:45:16.690
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2290
01:45:16.691 --> 01:45:21.691
<v Speaker 3>like some people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start training for a </v>

2291
01:45:21.691 --> 01:45:24.061
<v Speaker 3>marathon.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you get the beats right and you put them</v>

2319
01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:42.450
<v Speaker 2>otherwise they are going to cut the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beet Greens off and throw them away.</v>

01:50:03.791 --> 01:50:05.570
<v Speaker 5>you know the people that are listening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

2406
01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:10.580
<v Speaker 5>you're only going to hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this guy invented a beehive that </v>

2407
01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:13.921
<v Speaker 5>essentially has a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a dial that you can turn and the</v>

2408
01:50:14.111 --> 01:50:17.350
<v Speaker 5>dial changes the honeycombs into a flow </v>
<v Speaker 5>pattern.</v>

2409
01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:22.530
<v Speaker 5>It actually opens up and then the honey </v>
<v Speaker 5>drips down slowly into these jars.</v>

2410
01:50:22.991 --> 01:50:27.991
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't disturb the BS.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't disturb any of the normal </v>

2411
01:50:28.121 --> 01:50:33.121
<v Speaker 5>natural processes that these bees engage</v>
<v Speaker 5>in to make honey and it's so much less </v>

2412
01:50:35.051 --> 01:50:38.170
<v Speaker 5>invasive and when you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you go to the video,</v>

2413
01:50:38.171 --> 01:50:43.171
<v Speaker 5>it's called flow hive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you go to the video online and </v>

2414
01:50:43.171 --> 01:50:44.770
<v Speaker 5>they'll do a much better job of </v>
<v Speaker 5>explaining how all this is made,</v>

2415
01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:47.110
<v Speaker 5>but it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really fucking cool,</v>

2416
01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:48.320
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Indiegogo,</v>

2417
01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:53.440
<v Speaker 5>indiegogo campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't get the bee pollen and uh,</v>

2418
01:50:53.441 --> 01:50:54.700
<v Speaker 5>you don't get the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2419
01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:57.280
<v Speaker 5>the actual honeycomb itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I like to eat.</v>

2420
01:50:57.740 --> 01:50:58.960
<v Speaker 4>I love that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2421
01:50:58.970 --> 01:51:03.970
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is that you're not disturbing </v>

2422
01:51:03.970 --> 01:51:03.970
<v Speaker 4>the bees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2423
01:51:03.970 --> 01:51:06.241
<v Speaker 4>You're not really invading their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not impeding on their kind of </v>

2424
01:51:06.241 --> 01:51:06.241
<v Speaker 4>habitat.</v>

2425
01:51:06.241 --> 01:51:09.410
<v Speaker 5>Was that funny Vegan now because honey </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't Vegan for a long</v>

2426
01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:11.030
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2427
01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:13.160
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are,</v>

2428
01:51:14.110 --> 01:51:16.970
<v Speaker 4>there is a hardcore Vegan perspective </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2429
01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:18.450
<v Speaker 4>that honey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2430
01:51:18.451 --> 01:51:22.020
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't eat honey animal product,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2431
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:27.550
<v Speaker 4>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I respect people that have that </v>

2432
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:27.550
<v Speaker 4>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2433
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:27.550
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2434
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:29.780
<v Speaker 4>my perspective on it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

2435
01:51:30.230 --> 01:51:35.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our bee populations are threatened and </v>

2436
01:51:35.230 --> 01:51:35.230
<v Speaker 4>because of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2437
01:51:35.230 --> 01:51:37.790
<v Speaker 4>he has to be in fucking idiots and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2438
01:51:37.791 --> 01:51:39.770
<v Speaker 4>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've fucked a lot of shit up,</v>

2439
01:51:39.771 --> 01:51:40.630
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Phones too.</v>

2440
01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.260
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I think that,</v>

2441
01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:43.760
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2442
01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:49.100
<v Speaker 4>our family is trying to be of service by</v>
<v Speaker 4>helping foster,</v>

2443
01:51:49.130 --> 01:51:54.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>co the cultivation of bee populations </v>

2444
01:51:54.130 --> 01:51:54.130
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2445
01:51:54.130 --> 01:51:57.140
<v Speaker 4>in a sustainable way like by being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by getting involved,</v>

2446
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:58.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's one,</v>

2447
01:51:58.100 --> 01:52:00.050
<v Speaker 4>there's one school of thought like we'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>leave it alone,</v>

2448
01:52:00.051 --> 01:52:01.700
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is a,</v>

2449
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:03.190
<v Speaker 4>this is a threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2450
01:52:03.330 --> 01:52:06.330
<v Speaker 4>population that needs a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2451
01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:11.420
<v Speaker 4>graceful intervention were to help help </v>
<v Speaker 4>them foster their population.</v>

2452
01:52:11.421 --> 01:52:14.870
<v Speaker 4>So to the extent that I can play a small</v>
<v Speaker 4>part in that,</v>

2453
01:52:14.871 --> 01:52:16.130
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a cool thing.</v>

2454
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:17.900
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a cool thing as well.</v>

2455
01:52:17.901 --> 01:52:19.100
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I agree,</v>

2456
01:52:19.101 --> 01:52:20.040
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's that,</v>

2457
01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:25.360
<v Speaker 5>the very hardcore a segment of the Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 5>population that don't think that you </v>

2458
01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:27.740
<v Speaker 5>should eat honey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they don't have it like this,</v>

2459
01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:28.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like,</v>

2460
01:52:28.850 --> 01:52:33.850
<v Speaker 5>normally when you get honey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like this really complicated </v>

2461
01:52:33.850 --> 01:52:33.850
<v Speaker 5>process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to pull the,</v>

2462
01:52:33.850 --> 01:52:38.760
<v Speaker 5>the hives out and you have to scrape the</v>
<v Speaker 5>honey off and extract it in that way.</v>

2463
01:52:39.550 --> 01:52:41.540
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's totally different.</v>

2464
01:52:41.541 --> 01:52:44.810
<v Speaker 5>It's a different animal than commercial </v>
<v Speaker 5>honey production.</v>

2465
01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:45.800
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's</v>

2466
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:49.880
<v Speaker 4>practices involved with that that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>harmful to those insects,</v>

2467
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:54.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to the extent that you can find a </v>

2468
01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:54.910
<v Speaker 4>better way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2469
01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:57.860
<v Speaker 4>where you're still able to harvest the </v>
<v Speaker 4>honey in a way that,</v>

2470
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:59.250
<v Speaker 4>that is not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2471
01:52:59.270 --> 01:53:03.830
<v Speaker 4>kind of overly tapping into what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>need to survive and thrive.</v>

2472
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:05.480
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2473
01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:06.620
<v Speaker 4>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2474
01:53:06.621 --> 01:53:07.400
<v Speaker 4>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2475
01:53:07.401 --> 01:53:10.360
<v Speaker 4>it gets into like splitting hairs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2476
01:53:10.361 --> 01:53:15.361
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to talk about this when we </v>

2477
01:53:15.361 --> 01:53:15.361
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2478
01:53:15.361 --> 01:53:15.361
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2479
01:53:15.361 --> 01:53:17.980
<v Speaker 4>55 percent of co two emissions is caused</v>
<v Speaker 4>by animal agriculture.</v>

2480
01:53:18.150 --> 01:53:20.780
<v Speaker 4>We have bigger fish to fry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bigger things like,</v>

2481
01:53:20.781 --> 01:53:21.650
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2482
01:53:21.651 --> 01:53:23.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2483
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:26.110
<v Speaker 4>help bee populations in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2484
01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:29.030
<v Speaker 4>in our tiny little way by educating my </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids about it.</v>

2485
01:53:29.031 --> 01:53:31.640
<v Speaker 4>And by being a home to these 40 hives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a trip.</v>

2486
01:53:32.110 --> 01:53:33.690
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of hives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>40 hives,</v>

2487
01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:35.890
<v Speaker 4>you have eli,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how there's this.</v>

2488
01:53:36.030 --> 01:53:38.810
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they stack them for high.</v>

2489
01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:41.840
<v Speaker 4>So there's 10 of those 10 bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Towers.</v>

2490
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:43.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>down the hill,</v>

2491
01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:45.890
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three or four feet high.</v>

2492
01:53:46.530 --> 01:53:47.480
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was,</v>

2493
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:50.840
<v Speaker 4>they brought them in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>night and it was like,</v>

2494
01:53:50.841 --> 01:53:53.060
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like are we going to have swarming be,</v>

2495
01:53:53.061 --> 01:53:58.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as they're going to be like we were </v>

2496
01:53:58.061 --> 01:53:58.061
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't go near them for a couple days,</v>

2497
01:53:58.061 --> 01:53:58.700
<v Speaker 4>like let them acclimate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2498
01:53:58.701 --> 01:54:02.110
<v Speaker 4>they have to get used to like their </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment and what sorts of.</v>

2499
01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:04.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that bee populations function is</v>

2500
01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:05.090
<v Speaker 4>a trip</v>

2501
01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:07.220
<v Speaker 3>is really trippy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The little aliens.</v>

2502
01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to plan specific flowers </v>
<v Speaker 3>around your area to help them?</v>

2503
01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:11.820
<v Speaker 3>We haven't had,</v>

2504
01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:16.860
<v Speaker 4>did you that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the big kind of hurdle that we </v>

2505
01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:17.170
<v Speaker 4>had to get over was making sure that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>had adequate water supply for them.</v>

2506
01:54:17.230 --> 01:54:19.750
<v Speaker 4>But I'm not that I'm aware of.</v>

2507
01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:24.960
<v Speaker 3>We have in our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on our property we have specific plants </v>

2508
01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:26.740
<v Speaker 3>and flowers that attract bees and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other ones that attract hummingbirds.</v>

2509
01:54:27.070 --> 01:54:30.610
<v Speaker 3>We have a lot of hummingbirds on our </v>
<v Speaker 3>property just because of that because we</v>

2510
01:54:30.611 --> 01:54:32.860
<v Speaker 3>put certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain plants and flowers.</v>

2511
01:54:33.310 --> 01:54:37.990
<v Speaker 3>But the bees have a real issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently with cell phones.</v>

2512
01:54:38.430 --> 01:54:40.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this whole thing about how</v>

2513
01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:44.260
<v Speaker 3>the towers like impact them some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual signals themselves,</v>

2514
01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:49.300
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they impact the bees' ability to </v>

2515
01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:49.300
<v Speaker 3>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fuck with their head.</v>

2516
01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:49.300
<v Speaker 3>They can hear that shit.</v>

2517
01:54:49.630 --> 01:54:52.860
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't surprise me and the way that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have the high,</v>

2518
01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:55.270
<v Speaker 4>they literally have the hive mind and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that they,</v>

2519
01:54:55.450 --> 01:54:57.770
<v Speaker 4>they sort of functioned in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the,</v>

2520
01:54:58.370 --> 01:55:03.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the frequency at which they're </v>

2521
01:55:03.370 --> 01:55:03.370
<v Speaker 4>communicating is so mysterious and </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing.</v>

2522
01:55:03.370 --> 01:55:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's so cool.</v>

2523
01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.430
<v Speaker 3>I've told this story before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you might not have heard it.</v>

2524
01:55:07.431 --> 01:55:11.060
<v Speaker 3>When we were on fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the stunts they had these people,</v>

2525
01:55:11.090 --> 01:55:15.440
<v Speaker 3>they're the data get handcuffed to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pole or something like that.</v>

2526
01:55:15.441 --> 01:55:19.700
<v Speaker 3>And then we covered them with bs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>while we're doing this,</v>

2527
01:55:19.730 --> 01:55:24.730
<v Speaker 3>the beekeeper told us that we had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop filming because a local population </v>

2528
01:55:26.691 --> 01:55:31.691
<v Speaker 3>of bees had came over to investigate his</v>
<v Speaker 3>population of bees and they were above </v>

2529
01:55:32.211 --> 01:55:34.100
<v Speaker 3>us in this cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the air,</v>

2530
01:55:34.101 --> 01:55:35.720
<v Speaker 3>sorting it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't fighting.</v>

2531
01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:38.750
<v Speaker 3>They were somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating like,</v>

2532
01:55:38.751 --> 01:55:40.100
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck are you guys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

2533
01:55:40.101 --> 01:55:41.200
<v Speaker 3>we're here for a TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2534
01:55:41.210 --> 01:55:42.680
<v Speaker 3>so you're not moving in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2535
01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 3>we're not moving in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you guys</v>

2536
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:45.720
<v Speaker 5>taking our pollen?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2537
01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:48.180
<v Speaker 5>we're not taking your pile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like and they had an,</v>

2538
01:55:48.181 --> 01:55:53.181
<v Speaker 5>they worked it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They worked it out and then they </v>

2539
01:55:53.181 --> 01:55:53.340
<v Speaker 5>disappeared and then we kept filming but</v>
<v Speaker 5>it took,</v>

2540
01:55:53.341 --> 01:55:55.710
<v Speaker 5>we had an amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was really cool.</v>

2541
01:55:55.890 --> 01:55:58.600
<v Speaker 5>It was really cool to watch because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like what is going on and not,</v>

2542
01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:00.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I mean everybody was,</v>

2543
01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:05.840
<v Speaker 5>it was weird how people were interested </v>
<v Speaker 5>in it because Oh we got to stop filming </v>

2544
01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:10.341
<v Speaker 5>apparently like those local bee </v>
<v Speaker 5>populations intermix with this be </v>

2545
01:56:10.341 --> 01:56:10.341
<v Speaker 5>published.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2546
01:56:10.341 --> 01:56:11.670
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all I was high as fuck.</v>

2547
01:56:11.730 --> 01:56:14.100
<v Speaker 5>So it was super,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super interesting to me.</v>

2548
01:56:14.101 --> 01:56:14.820
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute,</v>

2549
01:56:14.821 --> 01:56:19.821
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When they're talking like how do you </v>

2550
01:56:19.821 --> 01:56:19.821
<v Speaker 5>know whose Beezer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's bs?</v>

2551
01:56:19.821 --> 01:56:23.480
<v Speaker 5>He goes and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could tell just by the way there </v>

2552
01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:24.240
<v Speaker 5>they're swarming in the air or they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to work this out.</v>

2553
01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:29.240
<v Speaker 5>And so there was this small cloud of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these bees because he had brought a lot </v>

2554
01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:33.411
<v Speaker 5>of bees and the local bees got together </v>
<v Speaker 5>with his bees and they were hovering,</v>

2555
01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:37.380
<v Speaker 5>but they had to disperse like they told </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone to get away.</v>

2556
01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:40.800
<v Speaker 5>They told the crew to get away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone leave the area,</v>

2557
01:56:41.050 --> 01:56:46.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wanted to make sure that there was </v>

2558
01:56:46.050 --> 01:56:46.530
<v Speaker 5>nothing fucking with this interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This strange because he has.</v>

2559
01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:48.450
<v Speaker 5>You have like the BBC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2560
01:56:48.451 --> 01:56:50.280
<v Speaker 5>he will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a deep respect for bees.</v>

2561
01:56:50.330 --> 01:56:52.410
<v Speaker 5>This guy really does love bees was </v>
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

2562
01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:57.740
<v Speaker 5>really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was interesting for me too because I </v>

2563
01:56:57.740 --> 01:56:58.140
<v Speaker 5>was covered with bees and that episode.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they were all over my hair,</v>

2564
01:56:58.150 --> 01:57:01.480
<v Speaker 5>my face and my arms and everything like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that and I never got stung.</v>

2565
01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:04.410
<v Speaker 5>Gets done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A couple people got stung on the set,</v>

2566
01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:06.000
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know what happened.</v>

2567
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.200
<v Speaker 5>It could have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2568
01:57:07.201 --> 01:57:09.450
<v Speaker 5>like maybe if like a bs in your armpit </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you,</v>

2569
01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:14.500
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you move your arm and it gets trapped </v>

2570
01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:14.500
<v Speaker 5>and it's like fuck this and it stings </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2571
01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:19.070
<v Speaker 5>Probably just just accidental </v>
<v Speaker 5>circumstances that came from having </v>

2572
01:57:19.070 --> 01:57:19.690
<v Speaker 5>millions or thousands or whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>

2573
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:20.580
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2574
01:57:21.090 --> 01:57:22.170
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2575
01:57:22.171 --> 01:57:27.171
<v Speaker 5>it was really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was really cool seeing them all get </v>

2576
01:57:27.171 --> 01:57:28.920
<v Speaker 5>together and try to figure it out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>just flying overhead.</v>

2577
01:57:29.450 --> 01:57:34.450
<v Speaker 5>Just communicating in some way that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>just really don't even have a clue.</v>

2578
01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:39.830
<v Speaker 5>We believe pheromones are involved,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we also know that there's some sort </v>

2579
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:41.430
<v Speaker 5>of signal that they're sending out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we just don't know what it is.</v>

2580
01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:44.910
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This whole insect world is a real trip.</v>

2581
01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:49.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean they really are alien.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They really are some strange alien life </v>

2582
01:57:50.731 --> 01:57:52.110
<v Speaker 5>form.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We found them on another planet.</v>

2583
01:57:52.110 --> 01:57:53.500
<v Speaker 5>We will be blown away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2584
01:57:55.230 --> 01:57:58.250
<v Speaker 5>I mean just the idea that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>queen and,</v>

2585
01:57:58.330 --> 01:58:00.570
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2586
01:58:00.690 --> 01:58:02.970
<v Speaker 5>and the fact that the hive is lost </v>
<v Speaker 5>without it.</v>

2587
01:58:03.020 --> 01:58:08.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that everything kind of falls into </v>

2588
01:58:08.020 --> 01:58:09.951
<v Speaker 5>place when the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the queen is inserted into the </v>

2589
01:58:09.951 --> 01:58:10.080
<v Speaker 5>population.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2590
01:58:10.081 --> 01:58:11.200
<v Speaker 5>I can't begin to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2591
01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:13.980
<v Speaker 5>like I know very little about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about the Queens?</v>

2592
01:58:13.981 --> 01:58:17.040
<v Speaker 5>A murderous bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's got a fucking Stinger that doesn't</v>

2593
01:58:17.041 --> 01:58:18.060
<v Speaker 5>come off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't,</v>

2594
01:58:18.061 --> 01:58:21.750
<v Speaker 5>she doesn't have like barbs on it the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way everyone else does and what she does</v>

2595
01:58:21.751 --> 01:58:26.751
<v Speaker 5>is she wanders around the hive looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>for female babies and she stabs him </v>

2596
01:58:26.751 --> 01:58:28.350
<v Speaker 5>right through the honeycomb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2597
01:58:28.650 --> 01:58:30.960
<v Speaker 5>that's what the female users.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2598
01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:33.480
<v Speaker 5>it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's fucking heartless cunt.</v>

2599
01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:38.900
<v Speaker 5>And one day she will be usurped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were a new female will come along </v>

2600
01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 5>and kick her ass and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But right now</v>

2601
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:47.130
<v Speaker 3>she's going to stab those babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she runs around like sticking her </v>

2602
01:58:47.130 --> 01:58:50.650
<v Speaker 3>needle and the honeycomb when she smells</v>
<v Speaker 3>a female fucking girl in there and take </v>

2603
01:58:50.650 --> 01:58:55.150
<v Speaker 3>my spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No threat to the throne.</v>

2604
01:58:55.210 --> 01:58:56.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very bizarre.</v>

2605
01:58:56.681 --> 01:59:01.280
<v Speaker 3>World of bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen the leaf cutter ant a</v>

2606
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:03.340
<v Speaker 3>documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did where they,</v>

2607
01:59:04.030 --> 01:59:09.030
<v Speaker 3>they cemented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they poured cement through this leaf </v>

2608
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:12.910
<v Speaker 3>cutter ant hive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this enormous hill.</v>

2609
01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:18.300
<v Speaker 3>And then they dug it out and structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was incredibly labyrinthine right?</v>

2610
01:59:19.541 --> 01:59:21.400
<v Speaker 3>And it went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was vast.</v>

2611
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:25.270
<v Speaker 3>It was huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge and incredibly complex.</v>

2612
01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:30.540
<v Speaker 3>Like they had areas where these leaves </v>
<v Speaker 3>would ferment and then they had pipes </v>

2613
01:59:31.810 --> 01:59:36.250
<v Speaker 3>that led tubes that lead through to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sky or to the,</v>

2614
01:59:36.251 --> 01:59:41.251
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the surface area where they would hit </v>

2615
01:59:41.251 --> 01:59:41.251
<v Speaker 3>air so that they could the fermentation </v>
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>

2616
01:59:41.251 --> 01:59:42.430
<v Speaker 3>the gases can be released.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2617
01:59:42.431 --> 01:59:47.431
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like with these tiny brains figure out </v>

2618
01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:48.830
<v Speaker 3>like we don't even know like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2619
01:59:48.910 --> 01:59:51.610
<v Speaker 3>human beings would fuck that up and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes sense for sure.</v>

2620
01:59:51.850 --> 01:59:54.730
<v Speaker 3>Unions will get involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there it is again.</v>

2621
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:55.720
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh right.</v>

2622
01:59:55.721 --> 01:59:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

2623
01:59:56.230 --> 01:59:58.870
<v Speaker 3>I did see this industry in the rain </v>
<v Speaker 3>forest.</v>

2624
01:59:58.871 --> 02:00:03.871
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they did an archeological dig </v>

2625
02:00:03.871 --> 02:00:03.871
<v Speaker 3>to like extract it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2626
02:00:03.871 --> 02:00:07.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They filled it up with cement and I </v>

2627
02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:07.620
<v Speaker 3>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2628
02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:08.650
<v Speaker 3>it's an enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at how wide it is,</v>

2629
02:00:08.651 --> 02:00:12.760
<v Speaker 3>it's probably 50 feet wide and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>

2630
02:00:12.761 --> 02:00:16.720
<v Speaker 3>It's very deep as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's so much to it.</v>

2631
02:00:17.050 --> 02:00:22.050
<v Speaker 3>There's so much going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how are they communicating with who </v>

2632
02:00:22.050 --> 02:00:26.410
<v Speaker 3>was the architect of all this structure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did they figure this out?</v>

2633
02:00:26.670 --> 02:00:30.880
<v Speaker 3>We all know how to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what in the fuck man.</v>

2634
02:00:32.290 --> 02:00:34.570
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>

2635
02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:39.580
<v Speaker 3>And a huge fucking mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And until a decade or two ago we had no </v>

2636
02:00:40.421 --> 02:00:42.580
<v Speaker 3>idea what the fuck was even below the </v>
<v Speaker 3>surface.</v>

2637
02:00:42.581 --> 02:00:44.560
<v Speaker 3>We had no idea what they were doing down</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2638
02:00:44.890 --> 02:00:49.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean it really is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is just absolutely amazing.</v>

2639
02:00:51.310 --> 02:00:54.090
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the ant death spiral?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen that now?</v>

2640
02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:59.200
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It like king of the obscure animal </v>

2641
02:00:59.200 --> 02:00:59.470
<v Speaker 3>video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I do remember it.</v>

2642
02:00:59.510 --> 02:01:04.510
<v Speaker 3>Spring free time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I love to watch a animal nature </v>

2643
02:01:04.510 --> 02:01:06.970
<v Speaker 3>videos cause I think it's very under </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciated.</v>

2644
02:01:07.020 --> 02:01:10.660
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uniqueness or the just the,</v>

2645
02:01:10.690 --> 02:01:13.860
<v Speaker 3>just the eccentricities of the animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2646
02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:18.760
<v Speaker 3>Just how amazing and fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that it is that crazy?</v>

2647
02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:22.620
<v Speaker 3>A rodent that looks like a few bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2648
02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that one where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>climbing into a hot tub?</v>

2649
02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:28.870
<v Speaker 3>Like this hot tub party?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an animal.</v>

2650
02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:30.960
<v Speaker 3>There's an amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

2651
02:01:31.090 --> 02:01:34.120
<v Speaker 3>this is an ant carol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is when the queen dies.</v>

2652
02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:37.930
<v Speaker 3>When the queen dies and the scent is no </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer there.</v>

2653
02:01:37.931 --> 02:01:40.340
<v Speaker 3>They don't know who to follow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what the fuck to do.</v>

2654
02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:45.640
<v Speaker 5>And they go into this spiral and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>will just do this until they run out of </v>

2655
02:01:45.741 --> 02:01:50.741
<v Speaker 5>energy and food and they will fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>die is probably literally shitty job.</v>

2656
02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:56.010
<v Speaker 5>They'll just continue to spend like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>until they just parish.</v>

2657
02:01:56.050 --> 02:01:56.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2658
02:01:57.380 --> 02:01:59.570
<v Speaker 5>They don't know where to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't know who to follow.</v>

2659
02:01:59.630 --> 02:02:04.630
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a hierarchy in the ant </v>

2660
02:02:04.630 --> 02:02:04.630
<v Speaker 5>community.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2661
02:02:04.630 --> 02:02:06.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it could be explained cve,</v>
<v Speaker 5>find an explanation for Jamie.</v>

2662
02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:09.530
<v Speaker 5>I probably butchered it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

2663
02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:14.720
<v Speaker 5>the idea being that they're following </v>
<v Speaker 5>the scent of the Queen and somehow or </v>

2664
02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:14.900
<v Speaker 5>another lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they don't know what to do.</v>

2665
02:02:14.901 --> 02:02:16.250
<v Speaker 5>So they just start going into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>spiral.</v>

2666
02:02:16.270 --> 02:02:18.410
<v Speaker 5>Maybe someone stepped on the queen or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something happened.</v>

2667
02:02:18.411 --> 02:02:23.411
<v Speaker 5>They removed the queen perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a bird might've stolen the queen </v>

2668
02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:27.350
<v Speaker 5>like a dragon come down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>swoop and take away their queen.</v>

2669
02:02:28.670 --> 02:02:30.860
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>World's crazy mysterious place.</v>

2670
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:33.020
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>insects in particular,</v>

2671
02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:33.660
<v Speaker 5>could we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2672
02:02:33.700 --> 02:02:36.650
<v Speaker 5>we know we don't think of him that much </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're so small,</v>

2673
02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:41.890
<v Speaker 5>but ants have the almost exact same </v>
<v Speaker 5>calculated biomass as human beings when </v>

2674
02:02:43.431 --> 02:02:48.431
<v Speaker 5>it comes to weight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meaning that there is exactly the same </v>

2675
02:02:48.431 --> 02:02:51.371
<v Speaker 5>amount of ant weight per the bodies of </v>
<v Speaker 5>ants on earth is there are humans.</v>

2676
02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:54.530
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you mean in total total.</v>

2677
02:02:54.531 --> 02:02:56.720
<v Speaker 5>Like if you added up all the ants and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the humans,</v>

2678
02:02:56.730 --> 02:02:58.970
<v Speaker 5>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the total mass would be the equal.</v>

2679
02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:00.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>

2680
02:03:02.090 --> 02:03:07.090
<v Speaker 5>That's so many answer are how many </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking answers it take to equal 180 </v>

2681
02:03:08.901 --> 02:03:11.030
<v Speaker 5>pound person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be a lot.</v>

2682
02:03:11.090 --> 02:03:13.180
<v Speaker 5>What's the average height or weight of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>person?</v>

2683
02:03:13.181 --> 02:03:15.980
<v Speaker 5>It's probably somewhere around there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like one 60 or something like that.</v>

2684
02:03:15.981 --> 02:03:17.120
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>between men and women.</v>

2685
02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:18.740
<v Speaker 5>Not In the US.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2686
02:03:18.741 --> 02:03:20.680
<v Speaker 5>it's like a hundred pounds more than </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2687
02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:22.460
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The average.</v>

2688
02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:25.040
<v Speaker 5>It was a how to make ants commit </v>
<v Speaker 5>suicide.</v>

2689
02:03:25.041 --> 02:03:28.220
<v Speaker 5>We go into a spiral.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can make them do it.</v>

2690
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:29.630
<v Speaker 5>Why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dick?</v>

2691
02:03:31.950 --> 02:03:35.600
<v Speaker 5>Simply divert the ants into an enclosed </v>
<v Speaker 5>space such as a plant pot,</v>

2692
02:03:35.630 --> 02:03:40.630
<v Speaker 5>large discovers a staggering 1000,</v>
<v Speaker 5>200 feet in diameter with each ant </v>

2693
02:03:41.330 --> 02:03:44.000
<v Speaker 5>completing a circuit every two and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>half hours.</v>

2694
02:03:44.001 --> 02:03:48.550
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

2695
02:03:48.650 --> 02:03:53.650
<v Speaker 5>So you can make them do it that I'm able</v>
<v Speaker 5>to break free owing to their lack of </v>

2696
02:03:54.261 --> 02:03:56.900
<v Speaker 5>sight and they march around in a loop </v>
<v Speaker 5>until they dropped dead.</v>

2697
02:03:56.901 --> 02:03:58.880
<v Speaker 5>What does it say before that explains </v>
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>

2698
02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:03.940
<v Speaker 5>How do they remove the army?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Has Navigate by following the pheromone </v>

2699
02:04:03.940 --> 02:04:04.820
<v Speaker 5>trails left behind by others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

2700
02:04:05.330 --> 02:04:10.330
<v Speaker 5>should enough of them lose the scent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they begin to follow the aunt </v>

2701
02:04:10.330 --> 02:04:11.420
<v Speaker 5>immediately in front of them and a huge </v>
<v Speaker 5>ant spiral forums.</v>

2702
02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:14.710
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2703
02:04:14.970 --> 02:04:17.000
<v Speaker 5>Follow the scent of those in front of </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

2704
02:04:17.001 --> 02:04:20.300
<v Speaker 5>Lots of fucking trip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And how weird.</v>

2705
02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:25.700
<v Speaker 5>It was weird that not only did nature </v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another have a need for this,</v>

2706
02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:28.070
<v Speaker 5>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2707
02:04:28.071 --> 02:04:33.071
<v Speaker 5>it came about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it developed and it's been the same way </v>

2708
02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:37.490
<v Speaker 5>that way for who knows how many of </v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

2709
02:04:37.530 --> 02:04:39.840
<v Speaker 5>What is the evolutionary purpose of that</v>
<v Speaker 5>though?</v>

2710
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:43.500
<v Speaker 5>Just they follow each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can't see shit,</v>

2711
02:04:44.290 --> 02:04:47.910
<v Speaker 5>but who the fuck is the first guy who?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does he know?</v>

2712
02:04:48.190 --> 02:04:53.190
<v Speaker 5>How does he know what he's doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should go and deep joe believes in </v>

2713
02:04:53.550 --> 02:04:57.450
<v Speaker 5>making these from fermentation bowls and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ground and like,</v>

2714
02:04:57.451 --> 02:04:59.760
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trippy fucking world.</v>

2715
02:04:59.761 --> 02:05:04.761
<v Speaker 5>The insect world is the insect world to </v>
<v Speaker 5>me is one of the most bizarre world or </v>

2716
02:05:04.761 --> 02:05:07.260
<v Speaker 5>the most overlooked because they're so </v>
<v Speaker 5>small.</v>

2717
02:05:07.261 --> 02:05:10.800
<v Speaker 5>We don't think of him as as alien as </v>
<v Speaker 5>they truly are.</v>

2718
02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:12.810
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if an ant was the size of a dog,</v>

2719
02:05:12.811 --> 02:05:14.550
<v Speaker 5>it would be the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2720
02:05:14.551 --> 02:05:16.740
<v Speaker 5>it's downright prehistoric.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2721
02:05:16.741 --> 02:05:17.820
<v Speaker 5>beyond?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2722
02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:19.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're prehistoric.</v>

2723
02:05:19.141 --> 02:05:21.030
<v Speaker 5>Even to dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dinosaurs.</v>

2724
02:05:21.031 --> 02:05:26.031
<v Speaker 5>Look at answering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck is that crazy thing with </v>

2725
02:05:26.031 --> 02:05:27.270
<v Speaker 5>an exoskeleton with unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 5>physical strength.</v>

2726
02:05:28.050 --> 02:05:29.280
<v Speaker 5>Physical strength than an man has.</v>

2727
02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:32.700
<v Speaker 5>The power to weight ratio is pretty off </v>
<v Speaker 5>the charts.</v>

2728
02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:33.570
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's incredible.</v>

2729
02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:38.600
<v Speaker 5>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm you ever seen ants carry large </v>

2730
02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:38.600
<v Speaker 5>things away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is what the fuck,</v>

2731
02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:41.520
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the world is a ruthless,</v>

2732
02:05:41.820 --> 02:05:46.820
<v Speaker 5>evil vicious world to ever see when the </v>
<v Speaker 5>female ants get ahold of vyvanse leaf </v>

2733
02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:49.380
<v Speaker 5>cutters as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get a hold of a male.</v>

2734
02:05:49.381 --> 02:05:52.650
<v Speaker 5>Males are larger and they have wings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>might be not be leaf cutters,</v>

2735
02:05:52.651 --> 02:05:54.690
<v Speaker 5>but whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they chopped the wings off of the male,</v>

2736
02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:58.050
<v Speaker 5>chop his arms and legs and then carry </v>
<v Speaker 5>him to the,</v>

2737
02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:02.640
<v Speaker 5>to the hive to breed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't seen that bitches so rude.</v>

2738
02:06:02.850 --> 02:06:05.410
<v Speaker 5>I had to bone up on my nature videos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

2739
02:06:06.820 --> 02:06:09.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I probably have to bone down.</v>

2740
02:06:09.210 --> 02:06:10.800
<v Speaker 5>You probably have too many of them in </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2741
02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:13.170
<v Speaker 5>Too much useless information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have the time,</v>

2742
02:06:13.171 --> 02:06:14.700
<v Speaker 5>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2743
02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:16.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where it comes from.</v>

2744
02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:21.260
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get compelled to research things and </v>

2745
02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:22.950
<v Speaker 5>to follow up and to start reading and </v>
<v Speaker 5>watching things.</v>

2746
02:06:22.951 --> 02:06:26.610
<v Speaker 5>And then next thing you know them have </v>
<v Speaker 5>gone on this crazy cycle.</v>

2747
02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:27.900
<v Speaker 5>Is that a?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2748
02:06:28.710 --> 02:06:31.510
<v Speaker 5>What kind of answered is the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 5>answer?</v>

2749
02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:34.020
<v Speaker 5>Two and a half inches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2750
02:06:34.290 --> 02:06:35.990
<v Speaker 5>that's a big ass aunt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2751
02:06:35.991 --> 02:06:40.991
<v Speaker 5>if you ever seen with wings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my friend Brian Cowen at one point in </v>

2752
02:06:40.991 --> 02:06:44.700
<v Speaker 5>time was studying to be a scientist and </v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2753
02:06:44.701 --> 02:06:47.280
<v Speaker 5>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had spent some time in a rain forest,</v>

2754
02:06:47.281 --> 02:06:50.640
<v Speaker 5>I think it was Borneo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a new New Guinea and forget what it was,</v>

2755
02:06:51.420 --> 02:06:56.420
<v Speaker 5>but they had to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone stayed in these tents and he's </v>

2756
02:06:56.420 --> 02:06:57.460
<v Speaker 5>elevated platforms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had a coat.</v>

2757
02:06:57.510 --> 02:07:00.080
<v Speaker 5>The posts with Turpentine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2758
02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:03.810
<v Speaker 5>because there were so many ants and if </v>
<v Speaker 5>the army ants found you,</v>

2759
02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:07.380
<v Speaker 5>if they found you in one of them decided</v>
<v Speaker 5>to bite you just like they follow the,</v>

2760
02:07:07.490 --> 02:07:11.310
<v Speaker 5>sent millions and millions and millions </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they would just eat you alive.</v>

2761
02:07:11.370 --> 02:07:15.030
<v Speaker 5>And people would regularly get killed by</v>
<v Speaker 5>ants there.</v>

2762
02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:18.690
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about the fact they kill elephants?</v>

2763
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:23.870
<v Speaker 5>They climb up the elephant's leg,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they find the ear and they start eating </v>

2764
02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:28.101
<v Speaker 5>the fucking elephant's brain and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>they all fall ascent and they all </v>

2765
02:07:28.101 --> 02:07:31.641
<v Speaker 5>follow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go up the elephant body and eat his </v>

2766
02:07:31.641 --> 02:07:34.881
<v Speaker 5>fucking brain alive from the inside and </v>
<v Speaker 5>kill a lot of things you wouldn't think.</v>

2767
02:07:38.150 --> 02:07:38.730
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2768
02:07:39.020 --> 02:07:44.020
<v Speaker 4>it's all you have to do is leave like </v>
<v Speaker 4>something out on your kitchen counter </v>

2769
02:07:44.020 --> 02:07:46.370
<v Speaker 4>for five minutes and out of mysterious </v>
<v Speaker 4>nowhere.</v>

2770
02:07:46.371 --> 02:07:49.970
<v Speaker 4>A line of ants will appear and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then if you remove it,</v>

2771
02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:50.900
<v Speaker 4>they disappear.</v>

2772
02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:56.760
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you ever seen something outside </v>

2773
02:07:56.760 --> 02:07:58.621
<v Speaker 5>that wasn't there before and then all of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a sudden the flies find it and then </v>

2774
02:07:58.621 --> 02:08:00.550
<v Speaker 5>within minutes there's all these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>flies.</v>

2775
02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:04.590
<v Speaker 5>There was no flies and then within </v>
<v Speaker 5>minutes they find this and somehow in or</v>

2776
02:08:04.610 --> 02:08:05.180
<v Speaker 5>they go,</v>

<v Speaker 5>flies.</v>

2780
02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:11.800
<v Speaker 5>It's very like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do they do in that?</v>

2781
02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:13.420
<v Speaker 5>We don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have no idea.</v>

2782
02:08:14.170 --> 02:08:16.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We got diverted.</v>

2783
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:19.350
<v Speaker 5>You need.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you need a insect ologist.</v>

2784
02:08:19.450 --> 02:08:21.070
<v Speaker 5>Is that what they would be called?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on,</v>

2786
02:08:24.130 --> 02:08:25.780
<v Speaker 5>Entomologist emojis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

2787
02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:26.590
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2788
02:08:27.190 --> 02:08:30.670
<v Speaker 5>What's the study of words?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The origins of words at technology.</v>

2789
02:08:31.150 --> 02:08:33.670
<v Speaker 5>Etymology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't get confused.</v>

2790
02:08:33.950 --> 02:08:38.400
<v Speaker 5>They'll order one and get the other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to find out the origin of the</v>

2791
02:08:38.401 --> 02:08:39.520
<v Speaker 5>word cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2792
02:08:39.521 --> 02:08:42.340
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know about bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what you're trying to.</v>

2793
02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:44.170
<v Speaker 5>A lot of layers to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian Callahan.</v>

2794
02:08:44.290 --> 02:08:46.300
<v Speaker 5>What compelled him to want to study </v>
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>

2795
02:08:47.170 --> 02:08:49.180
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of layers to Brian.</v>

2796
02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:51.380
<v Speaker 5>Brian's a deep dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2797
02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:54.760
<v Speaker 5>you start getting to know him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You dig deeper and deeper and deeper.</v>

2798
02:08:54.761 --> 02:08:57.190
<v Speaker 5>You find those educational background </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's a.</v>

2799
02:08:57.220 --> 02:08:59.410
<v Speaker 5>He knows a lot of shit about weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>

2800
02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:01.180
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2801
02:09:01.181 --> 02:09:02.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that,</v>

2802
02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:05.500
<v Speaker 5>that freaked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said he could hear the marching ants.</v>

2803
02:09:05.530 --> 02:09:06.530
<v Speaker 5>You hear them more?</v>

2804
02:09:08.970 --> 02:09:09.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

2805
02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:11.490
<v Speaker 4>So many of them on the floor that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

2806
02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:14.280
<v Speaker 4>you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God is millions of them.</v>

2807
02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:18.700
<v Speaker 4>You were talking about how you're a huge</v>
<v Speaker 4>radio lab fan,</v>

2808
02:09:18.710 --> 02:09:19.190
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2809
02:09:19.330 --> 02:09:21.510
<v Speaker 4>Have you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you gotten down with this show,</v>

2810
02:09:21.511 --> 02:09:22.940
<v Speaker 4>invisibilia?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2811
02:09:22.970 --> 02:09:24.600
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty cool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2812
02:09:24.601 --> 02:09:29.601
<v Speaker 4>I think he would dig it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that a difference in other different </v>

2813
02:09:29.601 --> 02:09:32.481
<v Speaker 4>podcasts?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's another one of those invasive </v>

2814
02:09:32.481 --> 02:09:33.780
<v Speaker 4>invisibilia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's another kind of NPR offshoot,</v>

2815
02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:38.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how sort of IRA glass at this </v>

2816
02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:38.840
<v Speaker 4>American life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these producers that have worked for</v>

2817
02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:40.560
<v Speaker 4>him have now started all these other </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcasts.</v>

2818
02:09:41.150 --> 02:09:46.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm super interesting stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was one recently about a guy who I</v>

2819
02:09:47.341 --> 02:09:49.560
<v Speaker 4>guess is a pretty well known guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2820
02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:54.860
<v Speaker 4>he's blind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he went blind as far as it like </v>

2821
02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:57.261
<v Speaker 4>a four year old or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He lost his sight and he started in </v>

2822
02:09:58.200 --> 02:09:58.650
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

2823
02:09:58.650 --> 02:10:02.410
<v Speaker 4>He started making these like clicking </v>
<v Speaker 4>noises with his mouth like,</v>

2824
02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:05.610
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his teachers would say,</v>

2825
02:10:05.611 --> 02:10:06.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>

2826
02:10:06.391 --> 02:10:07.860
<v Speaker 4>Settle Down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop doing that.</v>

2827
02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:13.170
<v Speaker 4>And his mother realized very early on </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there was some purpose to this.</v>

2828
02:10:13.171 --> 02:10:15.870
<v Speaker 4>There was some reason why he was doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>this show location.</v>

2829
02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:16.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2830
02:10:16.551 --> 02:10:21.210
<v Speaker 4>and what they realized is that he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>developing over many years of practicing</v>

2831
02:10:21.211 --> 02:10:24.960
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a finely attuned sonar ability.</v>

2832
02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:28.370
<v Speaker 4>Like he would literally be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2833
02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:33.120
<v Speaker 4>figure out like where he was and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>was in a room and what was going on.</v>

2834
02:10:33.770 --> 02:10:35.540
<v Speaker 4>Basically making these clicking noises </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

2835
02:10:35.541 --> 02:10:37.340
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the sound waves bouncing off.</v>

2836
02:10:37.341 --> 02:10:42.341
<v Speaker 4>And he developed this acuity to be able </v>
<v Speaker 4>to discern from that the parameters of </v>

2837
02:10:42.651 --> 02:10:47.651
<v Speaker 4>his environment to the extent that he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he like goes running.</v>

2838
02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:51.170
<v Speaker 4>He like rides a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

2839
02:10:51.230 --> 02:10:53.980
<v Speaker 4>Like what this guy has been able to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a blind person.</v>

2840
02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:59.000
<v Speaker 4>He goes running and his whole thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His whole thing is that he doesn't think</v>

2841
02:10:59.811 --> 02:11:04.811
<v Speaker 4>that he's anything special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thinks that all blind people could </v>

2842
02:11:04.811 --> 02:11:08.890
<v Speaker 4>develop this skill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that our education around blindness </v>

2843
02:11:08.990 --> 02:11:10.520
<v Speaker 4>is sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2844
02:11:10.810 --> 02:11:13.640
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a vernacular of disability,</v>

2845
02:11:13.790 --> 02:11:14.840
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're where we say,</v>

2846
02:11:14.841 --> 02:11:15.800
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're disabled.</v>

2847
02:11:15.801 --> 02:11:20.801
<v Speaker 4>You can't do this and we're going to put</v>
<v Speaker 4>you into this system and this is how we </v>

2848
02:11:20.801 --> 02:11:21.650
<v Speaker 4>do it with blind people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

2849
02:11:21.710 --> 02:11:26.710
<v Speaker 4>that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody could learn to do what </v>

2850
02:11:26.710 --> 02:11:29.021
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need to like empower blind people in </v>

2851
02:11:29.021 --> 02:11:29.120
<v Speaker 4>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's super interesting.</v>

2852
02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:30.500
<v Speaker 4>It was like a long interview with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

2853
02:11:30.501 --> 02:11:35.501
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>each week they have some kind of </v>

2854
02:11:35.501 --> 02:11:35.501
<v Speaker 4>interesting story like that.</v>

2855
02:11:35.501 --> 02:11:35.501
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a video of a young kid who can</v>

2856
02:11:35.501 --> 02:11:40.371
<v Speaker 5>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A young kid who walks on the street </v>

2857
02:11:40.371 --> 02:11:40.950
<v Speaker 5>makes a clicking noises and he knows </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're trash cans are and stuff.</v>

2858
02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:42.480
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2859
02:11:42.481 --> 02:11:42.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2860
02:11:43.050 --> 02:11:43.570
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2861
02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:46.880
<v Speaker 4>so like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the latent abilities that we all have,</v>

2862
02:11:46.970 --> 02:11:49.580
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we develop them,</v>

2863
02:11:49.581 --> 02:11:54.581
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of like how the disability </v>
<v Speaker 4>unlocks some other aspect of your brain </v>

2864
02:11:54.581 --> 02:11:55.310
<v Speaker 4>that that needs to develop in order to </v>
<v Speaker 4>survive.</v>

2865
02:11:55.620 --> 02:12:00.620
<v Speaker 5>One of the best pool players in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world is a young man named Shane van </v>

2866
02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:01.290
<v Speaker 5>Boning and he's deaf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been deaf since birth.</v>

2867
02:12:01.291 --> 02:12:06.291
<v Speaker 5>And when he plays,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he shuts his hearing aid off and it </v>

2868
02:12:06.291 --> 02:12:08.040
<v Speaker 5>allows some trademark look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2869
02:12:08.041 --> 02:12:11.700
<v Speaker 5>that's the guy that Sam is a different </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy than the other guy was a young black</v>

2870
02:12:11.701 --> 02:12:12.300
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2871
02:12:12.301 --> 02:12:14.700
<v Speaker 5>So this is the guy from the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from that podcast.</v>

2872
02:12:14.730 --> 02:12:16.040
<v Speaker 5>So is he doing okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kish?</v>

2873
02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:18.200
<v Speaker 6>Completely blind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

2874
02:12:18.410 --> 02:12:21.680
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't even have eyes say for </v>
<v Speaker 6>prosthetic ones.</v>

2875
02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:24.830
<v Speaker 6>Daniel has never seen a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a car,</v>

2876
02:12:25.070 --> 02:12:29.330
<v Speaker 6>or even the bicycle he's writing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So how does he know where he's going?</v>

2877
02:12:29.670 --> 02:12:31.820
<v Speaker 6>He's literally driving on the street </v>
<v Speaker 6>traffic.</v>

2878
02:12:32.210 --> 02:12:34.940
<v Speaker 6>The answer can be found in the clicking </v>
<v Speaker 6>sound.</v>

2879
02:12:34.941 --> 02:12:39.941
<v Speaker 6>You hear it's called Echo location.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bats use it to fly around in the dark </v>

2880
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:42.650
<v Speaker 6>and dolphins use it to navigate the </v>
<v Speaker 6>oceans.</v>

2881
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:48.070
<v Speaker 6>Daniel uses echolocation or sound to see</v>
<v Speaker 6>every environment has its own acoustical</v>

2882
02:12:50.061 --> 02:12:55.061
<v Speaker 6>signature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every surface has its own acoustical </v>

2883
02:12:55.061 --> 02:12:57.791
<v Speaker 6>signature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Daniel was born with an aggressive form </v>

2884
02:12:57.791 --> 02:13:01.031
<v Speaker 6>of cancer called retinoblastoma.</v>
<v Speaker 6>By the time he was 13 months old,</v>

2885
02:13:01.370 --> 02:13:04.700
<v Speaker 6>both of his eyes were removed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your 45,</v>

2886
02:13:05.420 --> 02:13:08.120
<v Speaker 6>so you lost your sight at such a young </v>
<v Speaker 6>age.</v>

2887
02:13:08.450 --> 02:13:12.050
<v Speaker 6>You don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 6>any memory of vision?</v>

2888
02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:15.440
<v Speaker 6>I have no memories at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was using echolocation from the age of</v>

2889
02:13:15.441 --> 02:13:18.530
<v Speaker 6>two or younger,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I really didn't know that much about</v>

2890
02:13:18.531 --> 02:13:19.640
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was just how you.</v>

2891
02:13:19.730 --> 02:13:22.820
<v Speaker 6>How you adapted to your environment </v>
<v Speaker 6>without really understanding it.</v>

2892
02:13:22.821 --> 02:13:25.430
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I doubt very seriously that most sighted</v>

2893
02:13:25.431 --> 02:13:28.760
<v Speaker 6>people give much thought or attention </v>
<v Speaker 6>about how they see,</v>

2894
02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:34.360
<v Speaker 6>so I really didn't give thought or </v>
<v Speaker 6>attention about how I see Daniel uses </v>

2895
02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:35.130
<v Speaker 6>echolocation to right</v>

2896
02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:35.860
<v Speaker 1>bike</v>

2897
02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:43.440
<v Speaker 6>cook.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is this a dish that you normally cook </v>

2898
02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:43.710
<v Speaker 6>Daniel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or are you experimenting with me?</v>

2899
02:13:47.670 --> 02:13:52.670
<v Speaker 6>Even hike alone in the mountains using </v>
<v Speaker 6>sound to see can be a hard concept for a</v>

2900
02:13:54.481 --> 02:13:57.030
<v Speaker 6>sighted person to understand what the </v>
<v Speaker 6>father,</v>

2901
02:13:57.031 --> 02:13:58.290
<v Speaker 6>Daniel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>will tell you.</v>

2902
02:13:58.740 --> 02:14:03.740
<v Speaker 6>He sees his environment as a series of </v>
<v Speaker 6>images created in his mind based on what</v>

2903
02:14:04.111 --> 02:14:09.111
<v Speaker 6>he hears using echolocation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you're calling out into the </v>

2904
02:14:09.111 --> 02:14:13.111
<v Speaker 6>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're essentially asking the </v>

2905
02:14:13.111 --> 02:14:13.111
<v Speaker 6>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are you and where are you,</v>

2906
02:14:13.111 --> 02:14:17.290
<v Speaker 6>and you're receiving those answers so </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're getting an image in your mind.</v>

2907
02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:22.320
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I definitely get a three dimensional </v>

2908
02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:26.940
<v Speaker 6>images with depth and character and </v>
<v Speaker 6>richness and I can process those and I </v>

2909
02:14:30.611 --> 02:14:34.490
<v Speaker 6>can interact with those from his modest </v>
<v Speaker 6>bungalow in long beach.</v>

2910
02:14:34.610 --> 02:14:38.960
<v Speaker 6>Daniel runs a small nonprofit called </v>
<v Speaker 6>world access for the blind.</v>

2911
02:14:39.710 --> 02:14:44.660
<v Speaker 6>Since being established in 2000 world </v>
<v Speaker 6>access has been the lone voice preaching</v>

2912
02:14:44.690 --> 02:14:46.580
<v Speaker 6>echolocation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

2913
02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:51.880
<v Speaker 6>every major blind organization in </v>
<v Speaker 6>America does not support Daniel's </v>

2914
02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:54.140
<v Speaker 6>mission.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So Daniel,</v>

2915
02:14:54.141 --> 02:14:59.141
<v Speaker 6>the national federation of the blind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>will say that echo location is just too </v>

2916
02:14:59.141 --> 02:15:03.440
<v Speaker 6>complicated for for most blind people to</v>
<v Speaker 6>grasp.</v>

2917
02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:08.520
<v Speaker 6>It's not so much the federation that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a concern you have here,</v>

2918
02:15:08.890 --> 02:15:13.890
<v Speaker 6>a blinded ms dot profession.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The blindness field who by and large </v>

2919
02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:20.040
<v Speaker 6>really kind of interactively remains </v>
<v Speaker 6>committed,</v>

2920
02:15:20.741 --> 02:15:24.070
<v Speaker 6>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to a traditional approach,</v>

2921
02:15:24.490 --> 02:15:27.340
<v Speaker 6>which is about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in my opinion,</v>

2922
02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:31.000
<v Speaker 6>restriction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is about this is how you do things,</v>

2923
02:15:31.090 --> 02:15:33.610
<v Speaker 6>this is the right way for a blind person</v>
<v Speaker 6>to do things.</v>

2924
02:15:33.940 --> 02:15:36.820
<v Speaker 6>This is safe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this isn't safe.</v>

2925
02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Watching that guy drive his bike is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking trip.</v>

2926
02:15:42.340 --> 02:15:43.930
<v Speaker 2>That is bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2927
02:15:43.931 --> 02:15:48.931
<v Speaker 2>And so you watch that and it makes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just think about human capability in a </v>

2928
02:15:49.511 --> 02:15:50.890
<v Speaker 2>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2929
02:15:50.891 --> 02:15:54.730
<v Speaker 2>it certainly does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It certainly makes you wonder like what?</v>

2930
02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:58.510
<v Speaker 2>What else we could do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2931
02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:00.060
<v Speaker 2>if we could figure that out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2932
02:16:00.061 --> 02:16:05.061
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a person like him that can </v>

2933
02:16:05.061 --> 02:16:07.471
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to see things with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound were making echo locations.</v>

2934
02:16:08.081 --> 02:16:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what other,</v>

2935
02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:13.570
<v Speaker 2>what other possible senses could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed?</v>

2936
02:16:14.590 --> 02:16:16.210
<v Speaker 2>And to that extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2937
02:16:17.620 --> 02:16:19.860
<v Speaker 2>well in the animal kingdom there's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>

2938
02:16:19.861 --> 02:16:24.861
<v Speaker 2>they training these German shepherds </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can smell cancer like early onset </v>

2939
02:16:25.001 --> 02:16:30.001
<v Speaker 2>of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing similar things with rats </v>

2940
02:16:30.001 --> 02:16:33.271
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously those animals have a </v>

2941
02:16:33.271 --> 02:16:36.781
<v Speaker 2>more developed sense in that area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to the extent that human beings have</v>

2942
02:16:37.031 --> 02:16:41.080
<v Speaker 2>unlocked potential in areas that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't really looked at,</v>

2943
02:16:41.110 --> 02:16:42.220
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretty interesting.</v>

2944
02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people certainly have finally developed </v>

2945
02:16:47.460 --> 02:16:49.441
<v Speaker 2>senses like certain people that play </v>
<v Speaker 2>instruments have finally developed </v>

2946
02:16:49.441 --> 02:16:52.891
<v Speaker 2>senses of sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somalis have finally developed sense of </v>

2947
02:16:52.891 --> 02:16:55.270
<v Speaker 2>tastes like he ever talked to someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's like a real wind,</v>

2948
02:16:55.271 --> 02:16:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Somalia and they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can drink a glass of wine,</v>

2949
02:16:58.910 --> 02:17:01.750
<v Speaker 2>have a sip of it and tell you what part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world he came from.</v>

2950
02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:07.280
<v Speaker 2>Like that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means they can sip it and tell you </v>

2951
02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:10.330
<v Speaker 2>what part of France there they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing these fucking grapes there.</v>

2952
02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:15.360
<v Speaker 2>These people with crazy noses that work </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the perfume industry that are highly </v>

2953
02:17:15.701 --> 02:17:16.920
<v Speaker 2>paid to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2954
02:17:17.350 --> 02:17:22.350
<v Speaker 2>decipher these accents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like something I couldn't even </v>

2955
02:17:22.350 --> 02:17:23.230
<v Speaker 2>relate to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think in general,</v>

2956
02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:26.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a need is the mother of that invention.</v>

2957
02:17:26.990 --> 02:17:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Like somebody who's not in Daniel's </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition is not on their own going to </v>

2958
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:33.100
<v Speaker 2>develop echolocation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2959
02:17:33.101 --> 02:17:33.700
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2960
02:17:34.270 --> 02:17:37.630
<v Speaker 2>It also makes you really wonder if there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are fields,</v>

2961
02:17:37.631 --> 02:17:42.631
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about how bees can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tune into the sound that a cell phone </v>

2962
02:17:42.631 --> 02:17:47.581
<v Speaker 2>makes and it fucks with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if there's anything like that </v>

2963
02:17:47.581 --> 02:17:50.881
<v Speaker 2>that's effecting us and social sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange way that we're not aware of </v>

2964
02:17:50.881 --> 02:17:53.740
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>always like really aware of when I go,</v>

2965
02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:59.220
<v Speaker 2>if I go to the wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I go to a real wild place is this </v>

2966
02:17:59.220 --> 02:18:02.980
<v Speaker 2>sound of it is different than the sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>of silence here.</v>

2967
02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're in a park here and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>

2968
02:18:05.450 --> 02:18:07.000
<v Speaker 2>it's nature's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nice,</v>

2969
02:18:07.001 --> 02:18:12.001
<v Speaker 2>it's relaxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a certain tone to like </v>

2970
02:18:12.001 --> 02:18:13.930
<v Speaker 2>Prince of Wales Island in Alaska is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect example.</v>

2971
02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:16.690
<v Speaker 2>We were there and we were on top of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain.</v>

2972
02:18:16.691 --> 02:18:17.590
<v Speaker 2>We're sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2973
02:18:18.190 --> 02:18:19.630
<v Speaker 2>you hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like,</v>

2974
02:18:19.730 --> 02:18:21.100
<v Speaker 2>it sounds different.</v>

2975
02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:26.100
<v Speaker 2>It feels different here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're getting a signal of no </v>

2976
02:18:26.100 --> 02:18:27.700
<v Speaker 2>signal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no cell phone,</v>

2977
02:18:27.730 --> 02:18:32.730
<v Speaker 2>there's no radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not tuning into anything other </v>

2978
02:18:32.730 --> 02:18:36.031
<v Speaker 2>than nature itself and it has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different tone to it than a city has.</v>

2979
02:18:36.850 --> 02:18:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Well for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2980
02:18:37.871 --> 02:18:40.090
<v Speaker 2>I would say that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying there's no signal,</v>

2981
02:18:40.091 --> 02:18:42.250
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's probably a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful signal.</v>

2982
02:18:42.251 --> 02:18:45.400
<v Speaker 2>It's just a different signal goes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong way to say it.</v>

2983
02:18:45.550 --> 02:18:46.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2984
02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:51.880
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is vibration and energy and </v>

2985
02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:51.880
<v Speaker 2>if you don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2986
02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:54.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't real,</v>

2987
02:18:54.250 --> 02:18:59.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go hang out with negative people for a </v>

2988
02:18:59.250 --> 02:18:59.660
<v Speaker 2>week and see how you start behaving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So trying to,</v>

2989
02:18:59.730 --> 02:19:04.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an environment is no different and we </v>

2990
02:19:04.730 --> 02:19:05.950
<v Speaker 2>tend to believe that if we can't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that it's not real.</v>

2991
02:19:05.951 --> 02:19:07.690
<v Speaker 2>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2992
02:19:08.050 --> 02:19:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Daniel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you know is putting out sound waves </v>

2993
02:19:13.050 --> 02:19:16.660
<v Speaker 2>into the world and he's able to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out what his environment is.</v>

2994
02:19:16.810 --> 02:19:18.610
<v Speaker 2>You can't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't see that.</v>

2995
02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:23.640
<v Speaker 2>But to him it's very real and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're surrounded by all kinds of crazy </v>

2996
02:19:24.521 --> 02:19:28.130
<v Speaker 2>invisible energies in waves from cell </v>
<v Speaker 2>towers to</v>

2997
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:30.920
<v Speaker 4>Wifi signals and all this kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2998
02:19:30.921 --> 02:19:35.921
<v Speaker 4>do we know how this is impacting us?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know people that are super sensitive </v>

2999
02:19:35.921 --> 02:19:36.170
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

3000
02:19:36.171 --> 02:19:39.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to Wifi and cell phones,</v>

3001
02:19:39.831 --> 02:19:41.690
<v Speaker 4>like they get headaches and all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

3002
02:19:41.850 --> 02:19:45.650
<v Speaker 3>So what is this Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Students Science experiment finds plants</v>

3003
02:19:45.651 --> 02:19:47.210
<v Speaker 3>won't grow near Wifi router.</v>

3004
02:19:47.490 --> 02:19:51.720
<v Speaker 7>Some ninth graders in Denmark did a test</v>
<v Speaker 7>where they put what they said was,</v>

3005
02:19:51.721 --> 02:19:56.721
<v Speaker 7>are they tested a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's the same radiation of cell phone </v>

3006
02:19:56.721 --> 02:19:59.481
<v Speaker 7>gives off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they put some watercress I think is </v>

3007
02:19:59.481 --> 02:20:02.241
<v Speaker 7>what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or garden crest and six trays in one </v>

3008
02:20:02.241 --> 02:20:05.961
<v Speaker 7>room,</v>
<v Speaker 7>six trays and another with two wifi </v>

3009
02:20:05.961 --> 02:20:05.961
<v Speaker 7>routers and essentially as you can send </v>
<v Speaker 7>a picture,</v>

3010
02:20:05.961 --> 02:20:06.480
<v Speaker 7>didn't grow.</v>

3011
02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:12.240
<v Speaker 3>The ones in the Wifi routers is no </v>
<v Speaker 3>different in the environment other than </v>

3012
02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:13.400
<v Speaker 3>the fact that Wifi routers were there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3013
02:20:13.420 --> 02:20:14.950
<v Speaker 3>that ain't good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's frightening.</v>

3014
02:20:15.250 --> 02:20:20.250
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twelve days of growth and then it </v>

3015
02:20:20.250 --> 02:20:22.620
<v Speaker 3>totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a signal if your phone </v>

3016
02:20:22.620 --> 02:20:25.561
<v Speaker 3>can pick up that signal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is something in the air and that </v>

3017
02:20:25.561 --> 02:20:27.910
<v Speaker 3>something in the air is probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>disruptive to other things that are also</v>

3018
02:20:27.911 --> 02:20:28.420
<v Speaker 3>in the air.</v>

3019
02:20:30.430 --> 02:20:32.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking up the BS.</v>

3020
02:20:32.291 --> 02:20:33.430
<v Speaker 4>What's it doing to your brain?</v>

3021
02:20:33.650 --> 02:20:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels different man.</v>

3022
02:20:36.970 --> 02:20:38.960
<v Speaker 3>When you go to a place with no cell </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone signal,</v>

3023
02:20:38.961 --> 02:20:42.410
<v Speaker 3>it literally feels different and it's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>rare that we do that.</v>

3024
02:20:42.650 --> 02:20:43.940
<v Speaker 3>So rare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3025
02:20:43.941 --> 02:20:46.190
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just the cell phone signal.</v>

3026
02:20:46.191 --> 02:20:50.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's all kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People give off a certain signal to.</v>

3027
02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:54.860
<v Speaker 3>People want to think that that's hippy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and woo woo,</v>

3028
02:20:54.861 --> 02:20:59.861
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're around really negative </v>

3029
02:20:59.861 --> 02:20:59.990
<v Speaker 3>people that are going to go away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>this person and it's not just,</v>

3030
02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:05.020
<v Speaker 3>you got to get away from them because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they say certain things like they give </v>

3031
02:21:05.020 --> 02:21:05.020
<v Speaker 3>off a vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3032
02:21:05.020 --> 02:21:09.250
<v Speaker 3>that that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a hippie thing to say the vibes </v>

3033
02:21:09.250 --> 02:21:12.230
<v Speaker 3>guys giving me a bad vibe man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's real.</v>

3034
02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I think there are certain rules.</v>

3035
02:21:14.450 --> 02:21:16.270
<v Speaker 4>You walk into a room and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3036
02:21:16.271 --> 02:21:18.950
<v Speaker 4>there's a heavy energy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something weird.</v>

3037
02:21:18.951 --> 02:21:20.740
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't feel right to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3038
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:21.500
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get,</v>

3039
02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:26.560
<v Speaker 4>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get like anxious and you got to </v>

3040
02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:26.560
<v Speaker 4>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3041
02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:27.260
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's had that experience.</v>

3042
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:30.130
<v Speaker 3>Well that's why nobody wants to buy a </v>
<v Speaker 3>house where someone was killed in it.</v>

3043
02:21:32.110 --> 02:21:37.110
<v Speaker 3>The house is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You find out that there was like a </v>

3044
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.110
<v Speaker 3>double homicide there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

3045
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.780
<v Speaker 3>fuck this place.</v>

3046
02:21:37.900 --> 02:21:41.160
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever been up in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3047

<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3049
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:48.670
<v Speaker 4>What's that Canyon called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right there.</v>

3050

<v Speaker 4>like I've written my,</v>

3055
02:21:57.640 --> 02:21:58.910
<v Speaker 4>I ride my bike all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3056
02:21:58.911 --> 02:22:01.240
<v Speaker 4>I could do a lot of training around here</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've written up that canyon.</v>

3057
02:22:01.241 --> 02:22:03.340
<v Speaker 4>It's a great client,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like there's something weird,</v>

3058
02:22:03.990 --> 02:22:08.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can feel like a weird energy and it </v>

3059
02:22:08.990 --> 02:22:08.990
<v Speaker 4>turns out that box,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3060
02:22:08.990 --> 02:22:09.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3061
02:22:09.581 --> 02:22:10.680
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Box Canyon.</v>

3062
02:22:10.681 --> 02:22:11.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

3063
02:22:11.321 --> 02:22:13.330
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's that chance and family?</v>

3064
02:22:13.331 --> 02:22:13.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3065
02:22:13.691 --> 02:22:16.540
<v Speaker 4>there was like the mansons were back </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and also there are,</v>

3066
02:22:17.110 --> 02:22:19.030
<v Speaker 4>I think it's Boeing is back there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3067
02:22:19.090 --> 02:22:21.700
<v Speaker 4>Contractors where they were doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>nuclear testing in the ground,</v>

3068
02:22:21.701 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 4>which is why that's a dry lake bed and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's still people that</v>

3069
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:27.310
<v Speaker 2>will tell you that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3070
02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:29.210
<v Speaker 2>it's not so safe there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3071
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:30.900
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did some shit out there,</v>

3072
02:22:30.901 --> 02:22:35.901
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they definitely did some shit </v>

3073
02:22:35.901 --> 02:22:35.901
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>

3074
02:22:35.901 --> 02:22:35.901
<v Speaker 2>there was some in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in seeing me,</v>

3075
02:22:35.901 --> 02:22:39.861
<v Speaker 2>there were some water well tasks that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they did that found traces of rocket </v>

3076
02:22:39.931 --> 02:22:41.190
<v Speaker 2>fuel in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3077
02:22:41.191 --> 02:22:46.191
<v Speaker 2>and there's a cleanup that's going on up</v>
<v Speaker 2>there right now is a really susanna </v>

3078
02:22:46.420 --> 02:22:51.420
<v Speaker 2>pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are worried about that clean up </v>

3079
02:22:51.420 --> 02:22:54.230
<v Speaker 2>because they're worried about is that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start digging and cleaning up that </v>

3080
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:58.450
<v Speaker 2>the dust is going to get into the air </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to blow through the </v>

3081
02:22:58.450 --> 02:23:00.390
<v Speaker 2>valley and whatever trace elements of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that rocket fuel.</v>

3082
02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Apparently there was a lot of disasters </v>
<v Speaker 2>up there.</v>

3083
02:23:02.371 --> 02:23:05.070
<v Speaker 2>They did a lot of shit down there in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fifties and the sixties.</v>

3084
02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:07.440
<v Speaker 2>Early testing on stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3085
02:23:07.441 --> 02:23:11.000
<v Speaker 2>They had like some sort of a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing there as well.</v>

3086
02:23:11.210 --> 02:23:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Apparently there was a nuclear incidents</v>
<v Speaker 2>much worse than three miles worse than </v>

3087
02:23:16.591 --> 02:23:18.000
<v Speaker 2>three mile island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3088
02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:22.780
<v Speaker 2>In 1959 they had something worse than </v>
<v Speaker 2>through my own.</v>

3089
02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>La Apparent.</v>

3090
02:23:25.411 --> 02:23:30.411
<v Speaker 2>I read a study on it though and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that said the study like the </v>

3091
02:23:30.411 --> 02:23:32.280
<v Speaker 2>half life of the type of radiation that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have is very short lived.</v>

3092
02:23:32.610 --> 02:23:35.250
<v Speaker 2>So it's not something that lingers in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

3093
02:23:35.310 --> 02:23:39.750
<v Speaker 2>The real concern that the apparently </v>
<v Speaker 2>according to what I read,</v>

3094
02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:44.460
<v Speaker 2>that the sober environmentalist are </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned with is the rocket fuel that's</v>

3095
02:23:44.461 --> 02:23:48.730
<v Speaker 2>leaked into the ground and gotten into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the well water in that area.</v>

3096
02:23:48.890 --> 02:23:50.030
<v Speaker 2>That's the real concern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>

3097
02:23:50.070 --> 02:23:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Is that why the lake that is dry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3098
02:23:52.740 --> 02:23:54.780
<v Speaker 2>I've no idea whether they pose try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

3099
02:23:54.850 --> 02:23:59.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew a dude who lived near a golf </v>

3100
02:23:59.850 --> 02:24:03.621
<v Speaker 2>course and the pesticides from the golf </v>
<v Speaker 2>course leaked into the well and he got </v>

3101
02:24:04.441 --> 02:24:04.920
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>

3102
02:24:05.310 --> 02:24:07.790
<v Speaker 2>His neighbor guard cancer kids in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>

3103
02:24:07.820 --> 02:24:09.240
<v Speaker 2>It was like all throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood,</v>

3104
02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:14.300
<v Speaker 2>people got cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got cancer because of the </v>

3105
02:24:14.300 --> 02:24:17.091
<v Speaker 2>pesticides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they all got a very specific type </v>

3106
02:24:17.091 --> 02:24:17.091
<v Speaker 2>of bone cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scary Shit.</v>

3107
02:24:17.091 --> 02:24:22.011
<v Speaker 2>Like he doesn't have a femur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of his femurs is like a metal rod </v>

3108
02:24:22.011 --> 02:24:22.710
<v Speaker 2>that they replaced his femur with </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he had cancer.</v>

3109
02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:24.060
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3110
02:24:24.250 --> 02:24:26.970
<v Speaker 2>And it's from pesticides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a big class action.</v>

3111
02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3112
02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:30.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck went down,</v>

3113
02:24:30.001 --> 02:24:34.380
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bone cancer from a golf course.</v>

3114

<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that fucking ground.</v>

3117

<v Speaker 2>toxic,</v>

3120
02:24:46.380 --> 02:24:48.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these things we have to worry about.</v>

3121
02:24:48.090 --> 02:24:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about,</v>

3124
02:24:55.880 --> 02:24:55.880
<v Speaker 2>up at the grocery store and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ingredients in it and like,</v>

3125
02:24:55.880 --> 02:24:57.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what all that stuff is,</v>

3126
02:24:57.660 --> 02:25:02.660
<v Speaker 2>whether it's safe and we're interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulatory bodies to make these </v>

3127
02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:03.040
<v Speaker 2>decisions for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3130
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Medications are constantly coming </v>

3131
02:25:10.750 --> 02:25:10.750
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Side effects.</v>

3132
02:25:10.750 --> 02:25:11.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean the commercials are just comedic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3133
02:25:11.180 --> 02:25:16.180
<v Speaker 2>like literally way more disclosures </v>
<v Speaker 2>about side effects than actual product </v>

3134
02:25:17.221 --> 02:25:18.310
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3135
02:25:18.330 --> 02:25:20.160
<v Speaker 2>We played one for acne medicine the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other day.</v>

3136
02:25:20.161 --> 02:25:22.310
<v Speaker 2>That was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3137
02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:24.280
<v Speaker 2>because there was this like suicidal,</v>

3138
02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:27.190
<v Speaker 5>not just suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were talking about bloody diarrhea.</v>

3139
02:25:27.490 --> 02:25:30.310
<v Speaker 5>They had these really pretty girls and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were walking down the street.</v>

3140
02:25:30.311 --> 02:25:32.320
<v Speaker 5>There were bopping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the girls in that commercial,</v>

3141
02:25:32.321 --> 02:25:34.270
<v Speaker 5>the redheaded girl contacted me on </v>
<v Speaker 5>twitter.</v>

3142
02:25:35.470 --> 02:25:37.060
<v Speaker 5>They had no idea what the fuck they were</v>
<v Speaker 5>selling,</v>

3143
02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:38.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just trying to be pretty,</v>

3144
02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:39.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't,</v>

3145
02:25:39.490 --> 02:25:40.980
<v Speaker 5>they're not talking in the commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

3146
02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:45.250
<v Speaker 5>but they're bopping down the street to </v>
<v Speaker 5>that forelle song happy and uh,</v>

3147
02:25:45.310 --> 02:25:50.310
<v Speaker 5>they have like beautiful skin and </v>
<v Speaker 5>beautiful hair and they're perfect bone </v>

3148
02:25:50.310 --> 02:25:51.340
<v Speaker 5>structure and they literally like </v>
<v Speaker 5>bopping as they're walking,</v>

3149
02:25:51.341 --> 02:25:55.030
<v Speaker 5>like they're in some happy music video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then as they're doing that,</v>

3150
02:25:55.090 --> 02:26:00.090
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the start reading the laundry list of </v>

3151
02:26:00.090 --> 02:26:02.740
<v Speaker 5>possible potential side effects that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>fatal bloody diarrhea,</v>

3152
02:26:02.741 --> 02:26:04.360
<v Speaker 5>stomach cramps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these different things.</v>

3153
02:26:04.390 --> 02:26:09.100
<v Speaker 5>And they're very specific which could be</v>
<v Speaker 5>fatal just because you're getting zits.</v>

3154
02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:14.340
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're saying like you're looking </v>

3155
02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:14.830
<v Speaker 5>back on the couch watching this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we've signed up for this.</v>

3156
02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:19.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean the Orwellian dystopia and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>like weirder than you could've ever </v>

3157
02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:20.710
<v Speaker 5>imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3158
02:26:20.850 --> 02:26:25.850
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you were talking about earlier is </v>

3159
02:26:25.850 --> 02:26:28.410
<v Speaker 5>you're using a medication to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 5>an issue that if you take a holistic </v>

3160
02:26:28.451 --> 02:26:31.180
<v Speaker 5>approach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's causing you to have acne,</v>

3161
02:26:31.470 --> 02:26:36.470
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is causing your skin to break out </v>

3162
02:26:36.470 --> 02:26:38.671
<v Speaker 5>and some sort of a horrible way that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>need this fucking bloody diarrhea </v>

3163
02:26:38.671 --> 02:26:41.080
<v Speaker 5>inducing medication to combat it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3164
02:26:41.081 --> 02:26:46.081
<v Speaker 5>I mean at some point you know the side </v>
<v Speaker 5>effects far outweigh the condition that </v>

3165
02:26:46.091 --> 02:26:49.650
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to treat and they're too </v>
<v Speaker 5>bloody diarrhea.</v>

3166
02:26:50.070 --> 02:26:55.070
<v Speaker 5>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There isn't even a single thought put </v>

3167
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:58.081
<v Speaker 5>into the cars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why don't we talk about what might </v>

3168
02:26:58.081 --> 02:27:01.351
<v Speaker 5>be leading to this and maybe some </v>
<v Speaker 5>choices that you could make that could </v>

3169
02:27:01.351 --> 02:27:02.230
<v Speaker 5>alleviate or prevent this.</v>

3170
02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:04.510
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just take this.</v>

3171
02:27:05.020 --> 02:27:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't make any money with those </v>

3172
02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:10.020
<v Speaker 5>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joy,</v>

3173
02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:12.241
<v Speaker 5>you're bloody diarrhea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's only one way to make the money </v>

3174
02:27:12.241 --> 02:27:15.160
<v Speaker 5>was the way to make the money is you </v>
<v Speaker 5>gotta you gotta sell the stuff.</v>

3175
02:27:15.850 --> 02:27:20.850
<v Speaker 5>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't make money by getting people </v>

3176
02:27:20.850 --> 02:27:21.340
<v Speaker 5>and you can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can write a book book,</v>

3177
02:27:21.490 --> 02:27:23.470
<v Speaker 5>make some money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to make us money.</v>

3178
02:27:23.471 --> 02:27:28.471
<v Speaker 5>Money is accutane or some point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Know that Broccoli growers need to </v>

3179
02:27:28.471 --> 02:27:29.620
<v Speaker 5>unite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3180
02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:33.190
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if there was like a plant that </v>
<v Speaker 5>cured zits is one plant.</v>

3181
02:27:33.430 --> 02:27:34.980
<v Speaker 5>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would they make that plan illegal?</v>

3182

<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that.</v>

3184
02:27:42.010 --> 02:27:44.450
<v Speaker 5>What is that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The benzoyl peroxide,</v>

3185
02:27:44.451 --> 02:27:46.260
<v Speaker 5>the stuff is all that money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3186

<v Speaker 5>skin out.</v>

3187

<v Speaker 5>It's all a puskus gets dried out and </v>

<v Speaker 5>have an acute disorder.</v>

3191
02:28:01.210 --> 02:28:02.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3192
02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:07.270
<v Speaker 5>against Western medicine or </v>
<v Speaker 5>pharmaceuticals when appropriate.</v>

3193
02:28:07.300 --> 02:28:08.830
<v Speaker 5>I just think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3194
02:28:08.831 --> 02:28:13.831
<v Speaker 5>we're too quick to take them to deal </v>
<v Speaker 5>with things that might be better </v>

3195
02:28:13.831 --> 02:28:15.010
<v Speaker 5>addressed in other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

3196
02:28:15.011 --> 02:28:20.011
<v Speaker 5>And it's also as.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why's it have to be one of the other </v>

3197
02:28:20.011 --> 02:28:22.480
<v Speaker 5>wise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has to be pharmaceutical drugs are </v>

3198
02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:22.480
<v Speaker 5>evil or they're great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3199
02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:22.480
<v Speaker 5>it's like sometimes</v>

3200
02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:24.860
<v Speaker 3>they're great and sometimes they're evil</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3201
02:28:24.861 --> 02:28:27.830
<v Speaker 3>the problem is profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once profit gets in the way,</v>

3202
02:28:28.140 --> 02:28:33.140
<v Speaker 3>our profit gets into the mix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd becomes a soul thing you're </v>

3203
02:28:33.140 --> 02:28:36.281
<v Speaker 3>chasing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like let's make sure that what </v>

3204
02:28:36.281 --> 02:28:38.540
<v Speaker 3>we're doing is the most beneficial to </v>
<v Speaker 3>society and to human beings possible.</v>

3205
02:28:38.690 --> 02:28:43.690
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's make sure we make a fuck load of </v>

3206
02:28:43.690 --> 02:28:46.091
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most money we could possibly make </v>

3207
02:28:46.091 --> 02:28:48.071
<v Speaker 3>because getting something passed by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>FDA is a huge process that cost millions</v>

3208
02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:53.740
<v Speaker 3>and millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by the time you actually do get a </v>

3209
02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:53.740
<v Speaker 3>product to market you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3210
02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:55.160
<v Speaker 3>you have to protect that product.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to protect that,</v>

3211
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:56.450
<v Speaker 3>that money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about money,</v>

3212
02:28:56.480 --> 02:28:58.880
<v Speaker 3>money and profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best thing to do is just</v>

3213
02:28:58.980 --> 02:29:03.980
<v Speaker 4>be proactive enough about your health so</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can do whatever is under your </v>

3214
02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:07.230
<v Speaker 4>control to prevent you from getting any </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of acute disease.</v>

3215
02:29:07.260 --> 02:29:09.810
<v Speaker 4>Not to say that it doesn't happen </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of course it does,</v>

3216
02:29:09.811 --> 02:29:10.830
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3217
02:29:11.870 --> 02:29:13.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's lots of things that,</v>

3218
02:29:13.710 --> 02:29:16.890
<v Speaker 4>that could be more deeply explored that </v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

3219
02:29:16.891 --> 02:29:21.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our culture really is sort of per </v>

3220
02:29:21.891 --> 02:29:23.570
<v Speaker 4>permittable too in kind of our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3221
02:29:23.690 --> 02:29:25.850
<v Speaker 4>what we accept as mainstream or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

3222
02:29:25.851 --> 02:29:29.040
<v Speaker 4>I started recently a going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>acupuncture,</v>

3223
02:29:29.041 --> 02:29:31.800
<v Speaker 4>which I'd never done before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was before.</v>

3224
02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:32.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done it.</v>

3225
02:29:32.341 --> 02:29:32.670
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

3226
02:29:32.790 --> 02:29:34.740
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think it was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3227
02:29:34.741 --> 02:29:36.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a pretty rational guy,</v>

3228
02:29:36.781 --> 02:29:38.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the idea of sticking,</v>

3229
02:29:38.161 --> 02:29:43.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of like the idea of Meridians and </v>

3230
02:29:43.161 --> 02:29:43.500
<v Speaker 4>sticking needles into my forehead and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

3231
02:29:43.501 --> 02:29:46.860
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really know I wasn't an </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediate,</v>

3232
02:29:46.890 --> 02:29:48.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody who's going to immediately jump</v>

3233
02:29:48.781 --> 02:29:53.781
<v Speaker 4>on that bandwagon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know a lot of people who have </v>

3234
02:29:53.781 --> 02:29:55.080
<v Speaker 4>benefited from it and I was having some </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that I want to address,</v>

3235
02:29:55.081 --> 02:29:56.250
<v Speaker 4>like particularly sleep.</v>

3236
02:29:56.250 --> 02:30:01.250
<v Speaker 4>Like I've been challenged by sleep </v>
<v Speaker 4>lately and so I went to see my friend </v>

3237
02:30:01.250 --> 02:30:04.761
<v Speaker 4>who's a Chinese medicine doctor and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>started doing it on me and it was hell.</v>

3238
02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:07.230
<v Speaker 4>It was really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really helpful.</v>

3239
02:30:07.231 --> 02:30:11.340
<v Speaker 4>And it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of balancing energy systems and</v>

3240
02:30:11.370 --> 02:30:13.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of how it works.</v>

3241
02:30:13.111 --> 02:30:15.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean so ornate and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this,</v>

3242
02:30:15.310 --> 02:30:20.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend who's studying Chinese </v>

3243
02:30:20.310 --> 02:30:20.310
<v Speaker 4>medicine and he's still kind of in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>residency,</v>

3244
02:30:20.310 --> 02:30:25.221
<v Speaker 4>so he's working underneath like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this Chinese dude who's been practicing </v>

3245
02:30:25.221 --> 02:30:27.260
<v Speaker 4>this forever and they come in and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy literally the,</v>

3246
02:30:27.261 --> 02:30:28.080
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3247
02:30:28.620 --> 02:30:33.330
<v Speaker 4>this Chinese medicine doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing he wants to do is take my</v>

3248
02:30:33.331 --> 02:30:38.331
<v Speaker 4>pulse on both wrists and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he takes it with his thumb and a couple </v>

3249
02:30:38.331 --> 02:30:42.170
<v Speaker 4>different places and apparently his </v>
<v Speaker 4>touch is so finely attuned that he,</v>

3250
02:30:42.171 --> 02:30:47.171
<v Speaker 4>he can tell all kinds of things about </v>
<v Speaker 4>like where you're at based upon the </v>

3251
02:30:47.171 --> 02:30:51.351
<v Speaker 4>pressure of your pulse and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the frequency and the tempo and all </v>

3252
02:30:51.351 --> 02:30:52.950
<v Speaker 4>these sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he wants to do that and then he wants</v>

3253
02:30:52.951 --> 02:30:53.760
<v Speaker 4>to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3254
02:30:53.970 --> 02:30:56.880
<v Speaker 4>your tongue and he could tell by looking</v>
<v Speaker 4>at your tongue,</v>

3255
02:30:56.881 --> 02:30:59.190
<v Speaker 4>like all sorts of crazy shit about where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're at.</v>

3256
02:31:00.030 --> 02:31:02.400
<v Speaker 4>Disney for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting people love it.</v>

3257
02:31:02.401 --> 02:31:04.860
<v Speaker 4>Or do you believe in possible placebo </v>
<v Speaker 4>effect?</v>

3258
02:31:05.540 --> 02:31:08.040
<v Speaker 4>I think the placebo effect is powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3259
02:31:08.041 --> 02:31:09.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm into trying anything,</v>

3260
02:31:09.841 --> 02:31:10.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why not right?</v>

3261
02:31:10.921 --> 02:31:11.560
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3262
02:31:11.580 --> 02:31:14.370
<v Speaker 4>contempt prior to investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way to get.</v>

3263
02:31:15.270 --> 02:31:16.240
<v Speaker 4>Get hoodwinked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3264
02:31:16.241 --> 02:31:17.460
<v Speaker 4>Something's got to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3265
02:31:17.461 --> 02:31:19.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

3266
02:31:20.430 --> 02:31:25.430
<v Speaker 3>is that better than saying I'm not going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to explore that because I think it's bs </v>

3267
02:31:25.430 --> 02:31:29.270
<v Speaker 3>without having any direct experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean it's nice to have some sort </v>

3268
02:31:29.270 --> 02:31:29.650
<v Speaker 3>of proof something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do you,</v>

3269
02:31:29.790 --> 02:31:31.950
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you prove that,</v>

3270
02:31:32.330 --> 02:31:33.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you run some tests,</v>

3271
02:31:35.190 --> 02:31:38.610
<v Speaker 3>some tests on what have the guy proved </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they can actually do that?</v>

3272
02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:39.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3273
02:31:39.301 --> 02:31:44.301
<v Speaker 3>I mean all I can tell you is that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>having issues with sleep and relaxation </v>

3274
02:31:44.301 --> 02:31:47.640
<v Speaker 3>and this seemed to benefit and alleviate</v>
<v Speaker 3>my problem to some extent.</v>

3275
02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:51.390
<v Speaker 3>So we don't use that placebo is that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>herbs that he prescribed me,</v>

3276
02:31:51.391 --> 02:31:56.391
<v Speaker 3>is that the acupuncture?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It certainly could be those things </v>

3277
02:31:56.391 --> 02:31:56.391
<v Speaker 3>because you've got to think about like </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep.</v>

3278
02:31:56.391 --> 02:32:01.160
<v Speaker 3>Oftentimes a psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oftentimes sleep is a matter of your </v>

3279
02:32:01.160 --> 02:32:04.761
<v Speaker 3>ability to relax and we've all been in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that situation before when you know you </v>

3280
02:32:04.761 --> 02:32:04.830
<v Speaker 3>have to be at work and five hours.</v>

3281
02:32:05.150 --> 02:32:10.150
<v Speaker 3>If I go to sleep right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can get four hours sleep and you look </v>

3282
02:32:10.150 --> 02:32:10.530
<v Speaker 3>at that clock and for whatever reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3283
02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:15.590
<v Speaker 3>you're stuck in that thing because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that you have to go to sleep right </v>

3284
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:17.280
<v Speaker 3>this moment and the pressure of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>keeps you awake.</v>

3285
02:32:17.310 --> 02:32:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take action to try to alleviate </v>

3286
02:32:22.310 --> 02:32:23.050
<v Speaker 3>that by acupuncture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by water,</v>

3287
02:32:23.370 --> 02:32:24.700
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

3288
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:29.950
<v Speaker 3>the mere act of taking action will shift</v>
<v Speaker 3>your focus into a cure and you can </v>

3289
02:32:30.570 --> 02:32:34.290
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes start thinking that whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>this placebo effect is real,</v>

3290
02:32:34.410 --> 02:32:37.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doubting that this guy has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>real app,</v>

3291
02:32:37.731 --> 02:32:42.731
<v Speaker 3>a possible a gift or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but wouldn't it be nice that we can </v>

3292
02:32:42.731 --> 02:32:43.320
<v Speaker 3>prove it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3293
02:32:43.350 --> 02:32:48.350
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you want to prove that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you want to just work with a </v>

3294
02:32:48.350 --> 02:32:48.350
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people and find out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh Oh look,</v>

3295
02:32:48.350 --> 02:32:48.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's right.</v>

3296
02:32:48.720 --> 02:32:51.000
<v Speaker 3>This guy doesn't have a gallbladder </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue where he's right,</v>

3297
02:32:51.001 --> 02:32:56.001
<v Speaker 3>this guy does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just met a lot of fuckers doing your </v>

3298
02:32:56.001 --> 02:33:00.141
<v Speaker 3>zone of healers and all these becoming a</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more cynical about this kind of </v>

3299
02:33:00.141 --> 02:33:01.500
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even before that,</v>

3300
02:33:01.501 --> 02:33:06.501
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy that was working with </v>

3301
02:33:06.501 --> 02:33:06.501
<v Speaker 3>all these mma guys that I know and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a zone healer and a,</v>

3302
02:33:07.050 --> 02:33:12.050
<v Speaker 3>he would press the back of your head and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you from the spots that he was </v>

3303
02:33:12.050 --> 02:33:13.610
<v Speaker 3>pressing what was wrong with you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3304
02:33:13.630 --> 02:33:14.700
<v Speaker 3>But it was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>

3305
02:33:14.810 --> 02:33:16.350
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>press harder here.</v>

3306
02:33:16.351 --> 02:33:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Does that hurt when I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3307
02:33:17.491 --> 02:33:19.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you press in harder stupid.</v>

3308
02:33:19.630 --> 02:33:21.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like we had this conversation.</v>

3309
02:33:21.691 --> 02:33:22.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is it?</v>

3310
02:33:22.470 --> 02:33:24.600
<v Speaker 3>How exactly is this working?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

3311
02:33:24.601 --> 02:33:29.601
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body's ability to heal itself is </v>

3312
02:33:29.601 --> 02:33:30.060
<v Speaker 3>dependent upon freeing your energy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>is how does that work?</v>

3313
02:33:30.060 --> 02:33:31.260
<v Speaker 3>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does that work?</v>

3314
02:33:31.380 --> 02:33:33.930
<v Speaker 3>And after badgering them with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>different questions,</v>

3315
02:33:33.931 --> 02:33:36.120
<v Speaker 3>the essentially admitted it was all </v>
<v Speaker 3>placebo effect.</v>

3316
02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:41.640
<v Speaker 3>I was like Jesus fucking Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was charging like 160 bucks to </v>

3317
02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:42.410
<v Speaker 3>get adjusted and he would touch your </v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

3318
02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:45.630
<v Speaker 3>Was this part of your show or to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

3319
02:33:45.631 --> 02:33:50.631
<v Speaker 3>I knew that was in the mixed martial </v>
<v Speaker 3>arts world who was dealing with all </v>

3320
02:33:50.631 --> 02:33:53.040
<v Speaker 3>these different fighters and Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys that had back injuries,</v>

3321
02:33:53.041 --> 02:33:56.340
<v Speaker 3>neck and it was a good chiropractor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this zone healing thing,</v>

3322
02:33:56.341 --> 02:33:58.440
<v Speaker 3>as he was getting into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more I would like listen to it,</v>

3323
02:33:58.441 --> 02:33:58.890
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3324
02:33:58.891 --> 02:34:00.050
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you.</v>

3325
02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:05.120
<v Speaker 3>You're telling me you could touch the </v>
<v Speaker 3>back of someone's head and press spots </v>

3326
02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:07.230
<v Speaker 3>and tell if they have a thyroid </v>
<v Speaker 3>condition the fuck out of here.</v>

3327
02:34:07.470 --> 02:34:09.420
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just not true,</v>

3328
02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:11.700
<v Speaker 3>and he kind of admitted it wasn't true.</v>

3329
02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:17.000
<v Speaker 3>He kind of admitted that ultimately what</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing is if you believe in what </v>

3330
02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.350
<v Speaker 3>he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will fix what,</v>

3331
02:34:19.430 --> 02:34:23.650
<v Speaker 3>what you have this wrong with you </v>
<v Speaker 3>because ultimately there's another great</v>

3332
02:34:23.710 --> 02:34:28.710
<v Speaker 3>a radiolab podcast on a placebo effect </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was one of them where they </v>

3333
02:34:30.191 --> 02:34:35.191
<v Speaker 3>were talking about this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hypnotized this kid with this </v>

3334
02:34:35.191 --> 02:34:37.160
<v Speaker 3>insane work problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>skin warts.</v>

3335
02:34:37.161 --> 02:34:42.161
<v Speaker 3>So if you've ever seen people that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked all over their skin where they </v>

3336
02:34:42.161 --> 02:34:45.091
<v Speaker 3>become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes incurable by medication and </v>

3337
02:34:45.091 --> 02:34:48.481
<v Speaker 3>they convinced this kid that they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypnotized him and that it was going to </v>

3338
02:34:48.481 --> 02:34:53.011
<v Speaker 3>go away and it went away on his arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His arm was like completely free of </v>

3339
02:34:53.011 --> 02:34:53.110
<v Speaker 3>warts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has never happens.</v>

3340
02:34:53.350 --> 02:34:58.350
<v Speaker 3>When someone reaches such an acute level</v>
<v Speaker 3>of infection like this kid had and so </v>

3341
02:34:59.991 --> 02:35:01.030
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a sense,</v>

3342
02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:06.480
<v Speaker 3>it is real in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not who he is as long as you're </v>

3343
02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:10.920
<v Speaker 3>gullible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as you're willing to </v>

3344
02:35:10.920 --> 02:35:13.630
<v Speaker 3>wholeheartedly jump in and believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that might be what's going </v>

3345
02:35:13.630 --> 02:35:14.800
<v Speaker 3>on with acupuncture.</v>

3346
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:19.950
<v Speaker 3>That might be what's going on with a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of quote unquote Chinese medicine or </v>

3347
02:35:19.950 --> 02:35:23.821
<v Speaker 3>eastern medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you believe that they have </v>

3348
02:35:23.821 --> 02:35:27.301
<v Speaker 3>found you a cure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body starts producing whatever it </v>

3349
02:35:27.301 --> 02:35:32.220
<v Speaker 3>actually needs to fix whatever ailment </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have and thus it becomes actually </v>

3350
02:35:32.220 --> 02:35:35.470
<v Speaker 3>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the the method is not correct.</v>

3351
02:35:35.740 --> 02:35:40.740
<v Speaker 3>The method is a trick and that trick is </v>
<v Speaker 3>effective and that effective trick does </v>

3352
02:35:41.981 --> 02:35:46.981
<v Speaker 3>convince your brain to fix whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem is and it's really baffling and </v>

3353
02:35:47.230 --> 02:35:52.230
<v Speaker 3>it only works if you're not a discerning</v>
<v Speaker 3>critical person because if you're a </v>

3354
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:57.151
<v Speaker 3>discerning person who's skeptical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to work because then </v>

3355
02:35:57.151 --> 02:36:00.211
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hyper analyze whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is or where the potential </v>

3356
02:36:00.211 --> 02:36:01.870
<v Speaker 3>possibilities of whatever it is and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>just won't.</v>

3357
02:36:01.900 --> 02:36:04.120
<v Speaker 3>It won't work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is weird.</v>

3358
02:36:04.510 --> 02:36:09.510
<v Speaker 4>There's no shortage of snake oil </v>
<v Speaker 4>salesman pitching all kinds of crazy </v>

3359
02:36:09.510 --> 02:36:10.630
<v Speaker 4>healing techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3360
02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:13.060
<v Speaker 4>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think that in fairness,</v>

3361
02:36:13.090 --> 02:36:18.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>acupuncture and traditions of Chinese </v>

3362
02:36:18.090 --> 02:36:18.090
<v Speaker 4>medicine east go back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3363
02:36:18.090 --> 02:36:19.740
<v Speaker 4>hundreds if not thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which critique there.</v>

3364
02:36:19.810 --> 02:36:21.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so does slavery.</v>

3365
02:36:21.210 --> 02:36:26.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But people are not going to see </v>

3366
02:36:26.210 --> 02:36:26.390
<v Speaker 4>witchcraft doctors in west La.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they wouldn't believe.</v>

3367
02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:28.720
<v Speaker 4>So I think that it would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that the,</v>

3368
02:36:28.730 --> 02:36:31.630
<v Speaker 4>the history and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sort of,</v>

3369
02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:33.220
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>traditions behind it,</v>

3370
02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:35.500
<v Speaker 4>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is merit there is there though.</v>

3371
02:36:35.501 --> 02:36:37.520
<v Speaker 4>But one scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3372
02:36:37.530 --> 02:36:39.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm the wrong guy to ask about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3373
02:36:39.281 --> 02:36:41.710
<v Speaker 4>I think if you're the wrong guy to ask </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that,</v>

3374
02:36:41.711 --> 02:36:43.120
<v Speaker 4>you're probably the wrong guy to talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

3375
02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:44.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably.</v>

3376
02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:45.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably.</v>

3377
02:36:46.630 --> 02:36:48.910
<v Speaker 4>But I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3378
02:36:48.911 --> 02:36:49.480
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3379
02:36:49.481 --> 02:36:51.420
<v Speaker 4>I just know from my friend who's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>studying as me,</v>

3380
02:36:51.421 --> 02:36:54.340
<v Speaker 4>he's been in school for crazy long </v>
<v Speaker 4>periods of time.</v>

3381
02:36:54.341 --> 02:36:56.320
<v Speaker 4>But you say school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you do air quotes?</v>

3382
02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:57.880
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3383
02:36:57.890 --> 02:37:01.660
<v Speaker 4>it's essentially like medical school was</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing like medical school.</v>

3384
02:37:01.661 --> 02:37:03.400
<v Speaker 4>How about that are sticking needles in </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

3385
02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:08.420
<v Speaker 4>enlightened insights that in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like studying physiology and studying </v>

3386
02:37:08.420 --> 02:37:09.250
<v Speaker 4>chemistry and organic chemistry and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>that kinds of.</v>

3387
02:37:09.670 --> 02:37:14.070
<v Speaker 3>It was like on Energy Meridians and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shock rose and all that jazz.</v>

3388
02:37:14.071 --> 02:37:14.520
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3389
02:37:14.521 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 3>isn't that like what it's based on?</v>

3390
02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:18.800
<v Speaker 5>There's some aspects of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

3391
02:37:18.801 --> 02:37:20.960
<v Speaker 5>But there's a lot of herbal medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think too,</v>

3392
02:37:21.350 --> 02:37:26.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for whatever reason I thought you said </v>

3393
02:37:26.350 --> 02:37:26.810
<v Speaker 5>urban medicine now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3394
02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:30.730
<v Speaker 5>verbal or the study of herbs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

3395
02:37:31.370 --> 02:37:34.640
<v Speaker 5>there's certainly some herbs that have </v>
<v Speaker 5>medicinal values.</v>

3396
02:37:34.641 --> 02:37:39.641
<v Speaker 5>One of my favorite herbs has massive </v>
<v Speaker 5>amounts of manipulate Oregano marijuana,</v>

3397
02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:47.760
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I just think that the sticking the </v>

3398
02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:50.111
<v Speaker 5>needles in you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably more that you're doing </v>

3399
02:37:50.111 --> 02:37:53.501
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing something to deal with it </v>

3400
02:37:53.501 --> 02:37:53.501
<v Speaker 5>and then doing something your body </v>
<v Speaker 5>reacts.</v>

3401
02:37:53.830 --> 02:37:58.830
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the weirdest thing that is kind of half </v>

3402
02:37:58.830 --> 02:38:01.631
<v Speaker 5>of what like sort of psychotherapy is to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the willingness to show up for it is to </v>

3403
02:38:02.241 --> 02:38:05.960
<v Speaker 5>walk through the door and to engage </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody else is almost,</v>

3404
02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:07.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no doubt.</v>

3405
02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:09.260
<v Speaker 5>Half the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3406
02:38:09.290 --> 02:38:11.330
<v Speaker 5>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's definitely merit to that.</v>

3407
02:38:11.390 --> 02:38:12.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and also like I said,</v>

3408
02:38:12.771 --> 02:38:14.860
<v Speaker 5>like the idea of any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3409
02:38:14.930 --> 02:38:17.480
<v Speaker 5>fill in the blank whenever type of </v>
<v Speaker 5>modality,</v>

3410
02:38:17.481 --> 02:38:19.820
<v Speaker 5>any type of therapy that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>effective,</v>

3411
02:38:19.821 --> 02:38:22.490
<v Speaker 5>even though it doesn't have any real </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientific basis to it,</v>

3412
02:38:22.910 --> 02:38:25.850
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the effect is still real.</v>

3413
02:38:25.850 --> 02:38:29.180
<v Speaker 5>You still get a benefit from it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this zone healing shit.</v>

3414
02:38:29.181 --> 02:38:31.430
<v Speaker 5>Like if you believe in it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it will affect you,</v>

3415
02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:37.000
<v Speaker 5>which is kind of fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of crazy that in some ways </v>

3416
02:38:37.430 --> 02:38:40.100
<v Speaker 5>there's merit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3417
02:38:40.101 --> 02:38:44.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean let's just talk about meditation </v>
<v Speaker 5>and Mindfulness Practices,</v>

3418
02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:49.360
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you want to apply your sort of </v>

3419
02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:52.300
<v Speaker 5>analytical perspective to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can draw the same conclusions and </v>

3420
02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:53.240
<v Speaker 5>really I could tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3421
02:38:53.241 --> 02:38:53.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

3422
02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:58.010
<v Speaker 5>anybody who is a consistent who has a </v>
<v Speaker 5>consistent meditation practice will tell</v>

3423
02:38:58.011 --> 02:39:00.170
<v Speaker 5>you that it improves their life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3424
02:39:00.171 --> 02:39:04.460
<v Speaker 5>But do you know that a placebo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like is there a provable,</v>

3425
02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:06.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that you sort of,</v>

3426
02:39:06.590 --> 02:39:09.220
<v Speaker 5>could you apply that same?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3427
02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:14.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>litmus test to that because this is </v>

3428
02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:16.610
<v Speaker 5>another sort of non western approach to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3429
02:39:17.240 --> 02:39:22.240
<v Speaker 5>being healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's been a lot of studies done </v>

3430
02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:22.240
<v Speaker 5>on meditation.</v>

3431
02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:24.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there's been a lot of studies </v>
<v Speaker 5>done on the effectiveness of mindfulness</v>

3432
02:39:24.581 --> 02:39:28.850
<v Speaker 5>and and the actual effect on the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's in a theoretical thing,</v>

3433
02:39:28.910 --> 02:39:31.400
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

3434
02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:36.760
<v Speaker 5>but it's not lying to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not saying that this frog potion </v>

3435
02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:41.591
<v Speaker 5>that I give you is going to cure your </v>
<v Speaker 5>cancer and then your body cures the </v>

3436
02:39:41.591 --> 02:39:44.321
<v Speaker 5>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a certain aspect of meditation </v>

3437
02:39:44.321 --> 02:39:45.500
<v Speaker 5>that's undeniably beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that,</v>

3438
02:39:45.530 --> 02:39:50.530
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that aspect of it is really been </v>

3439
02:39:50.530 --> 02:39:53.051
<v Speaker 5>scientifically analyze.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've done all these f MRI scans on </v>

3440
02:39:53.051 --> 02:39:55.520
<v Speaker 5>people that are Buddhist monks that have</v>
<v Speaker 5>spent years and years meditation.</v>

3441
02:39:55.521 --> 02:39:58.880
<v Speaker 5>They've done scans on people that were </v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

3442
02:39:58.900 --> 02:40:03.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deep rem sleep and different stages of </v>

3443
02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:03.900
<v Speaker 5>the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3444
02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:07.721
<v Speaker 5>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of scientific work that's </v>

3445
02:40:07.721 --> 02:40:09.970
<v Speaker 5>been done on what we call meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>achieving certain brainwaves,</v>

3446
02:40:09.980 --> 02:40:13.190
<v Speaker 5>achieving certain states.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those aren't fake</v>

3447
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:18.120
<v Speaker 3>and in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>placebo effect isn't fake either,</v>

3448
02:40:18.121 --> 02:40:23.121
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because every drug that that exists </v>

3449
02:40:23.121 --> 02:40:25.770
<v Speaker 3>exists because there's a receptive for </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in the human mind.</v>

3450
02:40:25.950 --> 02:40:30.950
<v Speaker 3>The reason why those drugs are effective</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because the mind knows how to </v>

3451
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:33.360
<v Speaker 3>actually produce that effect in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of limited quantity on its own.</v>

3452
02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:36.060
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why placebo </v>
<v Speaker 3>effects work.</v>

3453
02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:38.880
<v Speaker 3>That's the reason why we have opiate </v>
<v Speaker 3>receptors,</v>

3454
02:40:39.030 --> 02:40:44.030
<v Speaker 3>cannabinoid receptors and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different things and processes that the </v>

3455
02:40:44.030 --> 02:40:47.310
<v Speaker 3>mind can engage in with or without </v>
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>

3456
02:40:47.311 --> 02:40:50.070
<v Speaker 3>That's why those medications have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect on the body,</v>

3457
02:40:50.071 --> 02:40:52.740
<v Speaker 3>so in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>placebos,</v>

3458
02:40:53.370 --> 02:40:57.210
<v Speaker 3>if you believe in them work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was really is something is there,</v>

3459
02:40:57.300 --> 02:41:00.360
<v Speaker 3>isn't it even more than that though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the placebo effect works.</v>

3460
02:41:00.390 --> 02:41:02.820
<v Speaker 3>Even when you know it's a placebo </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes,</v>

3461
02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:04.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes we're not as much.</v>

3462
02:41:05.370 --> 02:41:06.260
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3463
02:41:06.630 --> 02:41:11.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was and that's I think what we're </v>

3464
02:41:11.630 --> 02:41:11.630
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

3465
02:41:11.630 --> 02:41:14.720
<v Speaker 3>Just doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The act of doing something to deal with </v>

3466
02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:16.230
<v Speaker 3>it makes you focus on whatever the issue</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

3467
02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:21.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean how many issues that people have </v>

3468
02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:24.471
<v Speaker 3>health wise or just due to a complete </v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of awareness of their physical </v>

3469
02:41:24.471 --> 02:41:28.461
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just stumbling through life on this </v>

3470
02:41:28.461 --> 02:41:31.810
<v Speaker 3>drunk and momentum of coffee and donuts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stress and cigarettes and traffic </v>

3471
02:41:33.241 --> 02:41:35.830
<v Speaker 3>and pollution and stress and cigarettes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and coffee,</v>

3472
02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:36.870
<v Speaker 3>coughing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>da bum ba bum,</v>

3473
02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:37.180
<v Speaker 3>bum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bum,</v>

3474
02:41:37.181 --> 02:41:37.520
<v Speaker 3>bum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bum.</v>

3475
02:41:37.770 --> 02:41:42.770
<v Speaker 3>And then just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the mere act of taking the time to </v>

3476
02:41:42.770 --> 02:41:45.900
<v Speaker 3>reassess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what it means to be a person to,</v>

3477
02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:50.270
<v Speaker 3>to just stop and pause and give thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>to your,</v>

3478
02:41:50.271 --> 02:41:55.271
<v Speaker 3>your day to day existence might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to reset a lot of the processes </v>

3479
02:41:56.041 --> 02:41:57.240
<v Speaker 3>that are in place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3480
02:41:57.490 --> 02:42:00.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's been huge in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3481
02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:04.030
<v Speaker 4>it's so counterintuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I would rather go out and do a four</v>

3482
02:42:04.031 --> 02:42:09.031
<v Speaker 4>hour run and sit down for 20 minutes in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the morning before I leave the house </v>

3483
02:42:09.031 --> 02:42:09.400
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and engage in that practice.</v>

3484
02:42:10.030 --> 02:42:15.030
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the last six or eight months I've </v>

3485
02:42:15.030 --> 02:42:15.180
<v Speaker 4>really kind of dedicated myself to it in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

3486
02:42:15.181 --> 02:42:15.820
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

3487
02:42:17.380 --> 02:42:18.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by prioritizing it.</v>

3488
02:42:18.821 --> 02:42:21.610
<v Speaker 4>And it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has been great.</v>

3489
02:42:21.790 --> 02:42:23.140
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you do it?</v>

3490
02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:24.460
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3491
02:42:24.461 --> 02:42:29.461
<v Speaker 4>I've played around with so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>different techniques over the years and </v>

3492
02:42:29.461 --> 02:42:29.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about momentum earlier,</v>

3493
02:42:29.710 --> 02:42:34.710
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I've never been able to like hit </v>

3494
02:42:34.710 --> 02:42:34.710
<v Speaker 4>momentum with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'll do it for a couple of days,</v>

3495
02:42:34.710 --> 02:42:39.061
<v Speaker 4>this version,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that version and I could never find a </v>

3496
02:42:39.061 --> 02:42:39.061
<v Speaker 4>way to really stick with it.</v>

3497
02:42:40.990 --> 02:42:45.820
<v Speaker 4>And I downloaded the headspace app which</v>
<v Speaker 4>has an iphone APP.</v>

3498
02:42:45.821 --> 02:42:49.870
<v Speaker 4>It's got guided meditation programs on </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and it started by this dude,</v>

3499
02:42:49.930 --> 02:42:54.930
<v Speaker 4>Andy Puddicombe who have had on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast recently because I became so </v>

3500
02:42:54.930 --> 02:42:58.441
<v Speaker 4>fascinated with this guy and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>very easy to follow a and I put it like </v>

3501
02:43:00.491 --> 02:43:01.570
<v Speaker 4>down in the dock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3502
02:43:01.571 --> 02:43:06.571
<v Speaker 4>like the bottom menu of my iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I see it in the morning and it's </v>

3503
02:43:06.571 --> 02:43:11.101
<v Speaker 4>super simple app and you just open it up</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's got a whole series of programs </v>

3504
02:43:11.101 --> 02:43:13.300
<v Speaker 4>that you can do and I just the earbuds </v>
<v Speaker 4>in and he just kind of talks you through</v>

3505
02:43:13.301 --> 02:43:18.301
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he takes the thinking out of it and </v>

3506
02:43:18.301 --> 02:43:18.301
<v Speaker 4>it just makes it easy and I've been able</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

3507
02:43:18.301 --> 02:43:23.070
<v Speaker 4>just something about the ease of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I've been able to kind of just </v>

3508
02:43:23.070 --> 02:43:25.090
<v Speaker 4>do it and create momentum around it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like anything else,</v>

3509
02:43:25.091 --> 02:43:28.660
<v Speaker 4>once you have momentum and once you </v>
<v Speaker 4>start to see the benefits of it,</v>

3510
02:43:28.690 --> 02:43:31.540
<v Speaker 4>then you're more enthusiastic about </v>
<v Speaker 4>pursuing it further.</v>

3511
02:43:31.850 --> 02:43:33.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's been cool and this guy is,</v>

3512
02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:35.410
<v Speaker 4>he's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a cool dude.</v>

3513
02:43:35.411 --> 02:43:39.490
<v Speaker 4>He a British dude and he was in college,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dropped out of college.</v>

3514
02:43:39.491 --> 02:43:40.690
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Andy Puddicombe,</v>

3515
02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:45.310
<v Speaker 4>Pud d I c o m,</v>
<v Speaker 4>b e a.</v>

3516
02:43:45.340 --> 02:43:50.340
<v Speaker 4>He has a great ted talk by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I grew up in London and dropped out </v>

3517
02:43:52.091 --> 02:43:56.530
<v Speaker 4>of college and what's in Nepal and </v>
<v Speaker 4>started studying buddhist meditation and</v>

3518
02:43:56.531 --> 02:44:01.120
<v Speaker 4>became a Buddhist monk and he lived </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically in relative seclusion for like</v>

3519
02:44:01.121 --> 02:44:06.121
<v Speaker 4>10 years as a Buddhist monk practicing </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditation and that he had this kind of </v>

3520
02:44:06.121 --> 02:44:08.470
<v Speaker 4>postmodern said a moment where he </v>
<v Speaker 4>realized like,</v>

3521
02:44:08.490 --> 02:44:10.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to go back to the west.</v>

3522
02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:15.280
<v Speaker 4>He had this calling to come back and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>a teacher and he started this company,</v>

3523
02:44:15.281 --> 02:44:16.840

02:44:16.841 --> 02:44:19.270
<v Speaker 4>They've got like over a million </v>
<v Speaker 4>subscribers on this app.</v>

3525
02:44:19.460 --> 02:44:22.180
<v Speaker 4>He's developed this huge business around</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and he's very accessible.</v>

3526
02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:25.870
<v Speaker 4>He's friendly and engaging and very </v>
<v Speaker 4>modern and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>right before he wants,</v>

3532
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:38.680
<v Speaker 4>once he decided he wasn't going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>monk anymore.</v>

3533
02:44:38.740 --> 02:44:43.300
<v Speaker 4>And before he kind of returned west,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he studied circus arts at the Moscow,</v>

3534
02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:47.020
<v Speaker 4>like college of circus and then went to </v>

3535
02:44:47.021 --> 02:44:48.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he became like a Spain,</v>

<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

<v Speaker 4>during his ted talk,</v>

3539
02:44:55.331 --> 02:44:57.320
<v Speaker 4>he's like juggling the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

3540

02:44:59.460 --> 02:45:04.460
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what benefits have you found from this </v>

3542
02:45:04.460 --> 02:45:06.660
<v Speaker 4>meditation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The biggest thing that I've found is </v>

3543
02:45:06.660 --> 02:45:06.660
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3544
02:45:06.660 --> 02:45:10.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm able to navigate stressful </v>
<v Speaker 4>situations much more gracefully.</v>

3545
02:45:11.170 --> 02:45:13.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm far less reactive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3546
02:45:13.540 --> 02:45:17.410
<v Speaker 4>to people I'm able to kind of calmly </v>
<v Speaker 4>take information out,</v>

3547
02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:22.440
<v Speaker 4>engage it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then respond more mindfully and I'm </v>

3548
02:45:22.440 --> 02:45:22.480
<v Speaker 4>able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3549
02:45:22.481 --> 02:45:24.370
<v Speaker 4>I've got a lot of stuff going on right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now is like,</v>

3550
02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:25.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just.</v>

3551
02:45:25.700 --> 02:45:30.700
<v Speaker 4>And to be able to kind of not get </v>
<v Speaker 4>anxious over that and just be able to </v>

3552
02:45:30.700 --> 02:45:30.700
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3553
02:45:30.700 --> 02:45:32.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>focus on one thing at a time and not get</v>

3554
02:45:32.351 --> 02:45:35.060
<v Speaker 4>worked up about the smaller stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3555
02:45:35.470 --> 02:45:40.470
<v Speaker 4>and just ultimately a much more </v>
<v Speaker 4>productive and constructive in my </v>

3556
02:45:40.470 --> 02:45:44.671
<v Speaker 4>interactions with other people focused </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I'm working present with my wife </v>

3557
02:45:44.671 --> 02:45:48.970
<v Speaker 4>and my kids and calmer and it's impacted</v>
<v Speaker 4>my sleep as well.</v>

3558
02:45:48.971 --> 02:45:49.990
<v Speaker 4>It's been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been cool.</v>

3559
02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:52.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3560
02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:55.930
<v Speaker 4>I think the benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've exceeded what I expected.</v>

3561
02:45:55.960 --> 02:45:56.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3562
02:45:56.741 --> 02:45:59.350
<v Speaker 4>I didn't expect it to be any crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference,</v>

3563
02:45:59.351 --> 02:46:01.390
<v Speaker 4>but it's been really great and it's sort</v>
<v Speaker 4>of like,</v>

3564
02:46:01.391 --> 02:46:06.391
<v Speaker 4>it's powerful too to be able to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand in your space and not get rattled </v>

3565
02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:10.010
<v Speaker 4>by things like that's a pretty potent </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of</v>

3566
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:12.890
<v Speaker 2>skill to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like just imagine yourself,</v>

3567
02:46:14.990 --> 02:46:16.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're at work,</v>

3568
02:46:16.100 --> 02:46:21.080
<v Speaker 2>your boss is coming at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he accuses you of unfairly if something.</v>

3569
02:46:21.081 --> 02:46:21.760
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>

3570
02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Your like your buttons are pushed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're on autopilot,</v>

3571
02:46:24.441 --> 02:46:29.441
<v Speaker 2>you react in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to be able to like reprogram </v>

3572
02:46:29.441 --> 02:46:29.660
<v Speaker 2>yourself and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3573
02:46:29.661 --> 02:46:31.070
<v Speaker 2>I have a choice here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3574
02:46:31.100 --> 02:46:33.470
<v Speaker 2>my brain is saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3575
02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:38.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to engage in that pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can actually tell a different story </v>

3576
02:46:38.990 --> 02:46:41.210
<v Speaker 2>and react in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a,</v>

3577
02:46:41.450 --> 02:46:45.230
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty powerful life skill </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's worth developing.</v>

3578
02:46:45.540 --> 02:46:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt.</v>

3579
02:46:46.521 --> 02:46:47.000
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>

3580
02:46:47.430 --> 02:46:48.670
<v Speaker 3>That's very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>

3581
02:46:48.690 --> 02:46:51.720
<v Speaker 3>Look into that and I'm definitely going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to download that APP and check out him.</v>

3582
02:46:51.750 --> 02:46:53.360
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fascinating stuff.</v>

3583
02:46:53.361 --> 02:46:56.070
<v Speaker 3>It's good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever fuck around with the sensory</v>

3584
02:46:56.071 --> 02:46:56.910
<v Speaker 3>deprivation tank?</v>

3585
02:46:57.900 --> 02:47:00.270
<v Speaker 2>I've been wanting to do that for so </v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

3586
02:47:00.390 --> 02:47:02.520
<v Speaker 2>I want to go to the float lab and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Venice.</v>

3587
02:47:02.580 --> 02:47:04.920
<v Speaker 2>I've got a friend who's got a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're big into that.</v>

3588
02:47:04.921 --> 02:47:06.270
<v Speaker 2>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would really dig it.</v>

3589
02:47:06.420 --> 02:47:07.500
<v Speaker 2>You have a tank?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3590
02:47:07.580 --> 02:47:08.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3591
02:47:08.551 --> 02:47:10.080
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the.</v>

3592
02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:12.270
<v Speaker 2>You probably talked about this a ton on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your show already,</v>

3593
02:47:12.271 --> 02:47:15.930
<v Speaker 2>but like what if you could like </v>
<v Speaker 2>encapsulate the benefits of that</v>

3594
02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:19.150
<v Speaker 3>removes the mind from the body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3595
02:47:19.390 --> 02:47:24.390
<v Speaker 3>the influence of the body and all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stimuli of the world arose.</v>

3596
02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:27.920
<v Speaker 3>It evaporates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rather it just it.</v>

3597
02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:33.330
<v Speaker 3>It's the mine untethered from the body </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a very weird way and the way I always</v>

3598
02:47:33.340 --> 02:47:35.350
<v Speaker 3>describe it as if we were having this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>

3599
02:47:35.351 --> 02:47:40.351
<v Speaker 3>but right next door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have people screaming at the top </v>

3600
02:47:40.351 --> 02:47:40.351
<v Speaker 3>of their lungs will be very distracting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would want to go,</v>

3601
02:47:40.351 --> 02:47:44.350
<v Speaker 3>let's go talk over here and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That screaming is information.</v>

3602
02:47:44.351 --> 02:47:49.351
<v Speaker 3>It's stimuli stimulus you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're constantly getting it right now </v>

3603
02:47:49.351 --> 02:47:53.911
<v Speaker 3>where we're sitting in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though these are very comfortable </v>

3604
02:47:53.911 --> 02:47:54.520
<v Speaker 3>or Ergonomic chairs from the Ergo depot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut Pisco chairs.</v>

3605
02:47:55.070 --> 02:47:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Very good for your posture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to fucking these.</v>

3606
02:47:57.740 --> 02:48:00.550
<v Speaker 3>I used my package to kill me at the end </v>
<v Speaker 3>of every show,</v>

3607
02:48:00.740 --> 02:48:03.040
<v Speaker 3>but because of these chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really fantastic,</v>

3608
02:48:03.041 --> 02:48:05.110
<v Speaker 3>but it's still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're still in a chair.</v>

3609
02:48:05.110 --> 02:48:08.560
<v Speaker 3>You're ass is pushing against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel the weight of your body.</v>

3610
02:48:08.770 --> 02:48:10.250
<v Speaker 3>You're moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>

3611
02:48:10.660 --> 02:48:12.940
<v Speaker 3>There's a desk in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have visual cues.</v>

3612
02:48:12.941 --> 02:48:14.770
<v Speaker 3>We're hearing things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have earphones on.</v>

3613
02:48:14.771 --> 02:48:19.771
<v Speaker 3>There's all stuff that's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly that we look at it as the </v>

3614
02:48:19.771 --> 02:48:21.040
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it really what it is is data.</v>

3615
02:48:21.130 --> 02:48:26.130
<v Speaker 3>It's data coming into your brain that </v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain has to process and that data </v>

3616
02:48:26.130 --> 02:48:28.780
<v Speaker 3>life itself is a distraction in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>tank.</v>

3617
02:48:28.810 --> 02:48:33.810
<v Speaker 3>There is no data there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean you have a very limited amount </v>

3618
02:48:33.810 --> 02:48:36.040
<v Speaker 3>of sensation of the fact that you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>in water that will eventually go away.</v>

3619
02:48:36.041 --> 02:48:38.840
<v Speaker 3>If you stay still long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the water's the same temperatures,</v>

3620
02:48:38.860 --> 02:48:43.860
<v Speaker 3>your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you will get to a point where you </v>

3621
02:48:43.860 --> 02:48:46.351
<v Speaker 3>don't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a thousand pounds of salt in </v>

3622
02:48:46.351 --> 02:48:46.351
<v Speaker 3>that water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you'll.</v>

3623
02:48:46.351 --> 02:48:50.160
<v Speaker 3>You'll float effortlessly and you're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>total darkness and as long as there's no</v>

3624
02:48:51.131 --> 02:48:54.520
<v Speaker 3>bang around the room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as you're in a good silent area,</v>

3625
02:48:55.000 --> 02:49:00.000
<v Speaker 3>you will experience quiet in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is you never get.</v>

3626
02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:06.030
<v Speaker 3>You will experience physical quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will be no input and the absence of </v>

3627
02:49:06.030 --> 02:49:08.100
<v Speaker 3>that input,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain becomes supercharged.</v>

3628
02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:12.480
<v Speaker 3>It makes it so much easier for me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand influences,</v>

3629
02:49:12.510 --> 02:49:17.510
<v Speaker 3>objectives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the things that I had been pushing </v>

3630
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:20.601
<v Speaker 3>to the back of my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>avoiding come to light instantaneously </v>

3631
02:49:20.601 --> 02:49:21.400
<v Speaker 3>highlighted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3632
02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:23.430
<v Speaker 3>all issues become highlighted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any,</v>

3633
02:49:23.431 --> 02:49:25.320
<v Speaker 3>any stumbling blocks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

3634
02:49:25.321 --> 02:49:30.321
<v Speaker 3>any things that you really need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>address all come to the forefront and </v>

3635
02:49:30.321 --> 02:49:34.700
<v Speaker 3>the way I describe it as the first 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes or so seem like,</v>

3636
02:49:35.930 --> 02:49:40.230
<v Speaker 3>like a seminar on my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my life is being explained to me.</v>

3637
02:49:40.231 --> 02:49:40.860
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>

3638
02:49:41.130 --> 02:49:45.960
<v Speaker 3>if I went to a guru that could explain </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me in no uncertain terms,</v>

3639
02:49:45.961 --> 02:49:48.360
<v Speaker 3>like someone who really knows every </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect of my life.</v>

3640
02:49:48.361 --> 02:49:53.361
<v Speaker 3>Like if you could plug a USB drive into </v>
<v Speaker 3>my head into some super computer that </v>

3641
02:49:53.361 --> 02:49:54.120
<v Speaker 3>can fix things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd go,</v>

3642
02:49:54.121 --> 02:49:54.450
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3643
02:49:54.451 --> 02:49:57.720
<v Speaker 3>look at all these issues you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to get rid of this,</v>

3644
02:49:58.260 --> 02:49:59.460
<v Speaker 3>clean out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this clutter,</v>

3645
02:49:59.670 --> 02:50:01.650
<v Speaker 3>stopped doing that because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>like it.</v>

3646
02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:06.680
<v Speaker 3>Don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't hang out with this person hanging </v>

3647
02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:07.230
<v Speaker 3>out with that person more concentrated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more on this aspect of your life.</v>

3648
02:50:07.590 --> 02:50:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Just creatively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an unbelievable tool.</v>

3649
02:50:11.070 --> 02:50:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go over a Jujitsu techniques in the </v>

3650
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:16.070
<v Speaker 3>tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go over transitions,</v>

3651
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:17.910
<v Speaker 3>I go over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up comedy in there.</v>

3652
02:50:17.911 --> 02:50:18.930
<v Speaker 3>I go over everything in there.</v>

3653
02:50:19.240 --> 02:50:20.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>

3654
02:50:20.170 --> 02:50:21.130
<v Speaker 4>I want to check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3655
02:50:21.131 --> 02:50:26.131
<v Speaker 4>it sounds the way that you described </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is very similar to the experiences </v>

3656
02:50:26.131 --> 02:50:29.230
<v Speaker 4>that I have when I'm in long distance </v>
<v Speaker 4>running and training.</v>

3657
02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:30.130
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3658
02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:31.110
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3659
02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:32.860
<v Speaker 4>it's different because your heart's </v>
<v Speaker 4>beating and it's,</v>

3660
02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:35.590
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of an active meditation </v>
<v Speaker 4>version of that,</v>

3661
02:50:35.620 --> 02:50:36.610
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3662
02:50:36.640 --> 02:50:38.080
<v Speaker 4>it's so powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3663
02:50:38.081 --> 02:50:41.340
<v Speaker 4>and the more that I learn about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>world of mindfulness you,</v>

3664
02:50:41.380 --> 02:50:46.380
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's untapped reservoirs of potential </v>

3665
02:50:46.380 --> 02:50:47.050
<v Speaker 4>personal potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3666
02:50:47.620 --> 02:50:50.620
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3667
02:50:50.621 --> 02:50:51.910
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes back to,</v>

3668
02:50:51.940 --> 02:50:56.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>western culture priorities like this is </v>

3669
02:50:56.940 --> 02:50:56.940
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3670
02:50:56.940 --> 02:50:56.940
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3671
02:50:56.940 --> 02:50:59.680
<v Speaker 4>the float lab like your tank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a mainstream idea.</v>

3672
02:50:59.950 --> 02:51:01.870
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's becoming more so.</v>

3673
02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:04.480
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean to look the typical American,</v>

3674
02:51:04.620 --> 02:51:05.440
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3675
02:51:05.470 --> 02:51:09.510
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of a foreign idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this idea that you know,</v>

3676
02:51:09.550 --> 02:51:11.120
<v Speaker 4>your thinking mind is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

3677
02:51:11.180 --> 02:51:15.220
<v Speaker 4>is distinct from your higher </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and to the extent that you</v>

3678
02:51:15.490 --> 02:51:20.490
<v Speaker 4>have control and you can harness your </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking mind for your benefit and </v>

3679
02:51:20.490 --> 02:51:20.490
<v Speaker 4>you're able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3680
02:51:20.490 --> 02:51:22.660
<v Speaker 4>silence the idol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>negative chatter,</v>

3681
02:51:22.661 --> 02:51:24.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people like you said,</v>

3682
02:51:24.071 --> 02:51:24.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's coffee,</v>

3683
02:51:25.480 --> 02:51:26.410
<v Speaker 4>donuts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3684
02:51:26.750 --> 02:51:28.030
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a looping,</v>

3685
02:51:28.300 --> 02:51:33.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my mind loops as much as the next </v>

3686
02:51:33.300 --> 02:51:36.091
<v Speaker 4>person and generally it's not very kind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things that are looping self defeatist </v>

3687
02:51:36.221 --> 02:51:38.200
<v Speaker 4>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>negative thoughts.</v>

3688
02:51:38.470 --> 02:51:40.840
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do Joe Rogan's podcast.</v>

3689
02:51:40.841 --> 02:51:43.180
<v Speaker 4>What if the desk squad army gangs up on </v>
<v Speaker 4>me?</v>

3690
02:51:43.390 --> 02:51:44.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going to happen?</v>

3691
02:51:44.381 --> 02:51:45.670
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like whatever it is.</v>

3692
02:51:45.671 --> 02:51:50.671
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like at meditation allows you to </v>

3693
02:51:50.680 --> 02:51:53.350
<v Speaker 4>understand that you don't have to engage</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that.</v>

3694
02:51:53.700 --> 02:51:57.280
<v Speaker 4>It gives you a toolbox to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me tell a different story.</v>

3695
02:51:57.580 --> 02:52:02.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to entertain that story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that story that I've been listening to </v>

3696
02:52:02.580 --> 02:52:05.701
<v Speaker 4>my entire life that's led me down a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain path in my life and helped sort </v>

3697
02:52:05.701 --> 02:52:06.040
<v Speaker 4>of forge a certain</v>

3698
02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:08.350
<v Speaker 5>trajectory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if I tell a new story</v>

3699
02:52:10.340 --> 02:52:13.400
<v Speaker 5>and let's put that story together and </v>
<v Speaker 5>see where that leads like,</v>

3700
02:52:13.401 --> 02:52:15.290
<v Speaker 5>could there be anything more powerful </v>
<v Speaker 5>than that?</v>

3701
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:17.070
<v Speaker 5>Very few things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3702
02:52:17.570 --> 02:52:20.260
<v Speaker 5>Acting on those positive thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Write that.</v>

3703
02:52:20.300 --> 02:52:22.550
<v Speaker 5>That's just as powerful if not more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

3704
02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:25.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And and uninstalling those buttons,</v>

3705
02:52:25.521 --> 02:52:30.170
<v Speaker 5>that car that causes you to react and </v>
<v Speaker 5>create negative consequences for you.</v>

3706
02:52:31.310 --> 02:52:33.410
<v Speaker 5>That's a good way to end this podcast.</v>
