00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Five four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 1>two</v>
<v Speaker 1>day Ruben lays gentlemen,</v>

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>how are you buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up bro?</v>

4
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen you a while.</v>

5
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>The last time we saw each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just now,</v>

6
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 1>but before that was right before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.830
<v Speaker 1>The day before the world changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Squirrely tourette's.</v>

8
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Squirly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that literally,</v>

9
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a lifetime ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even a lifetime ago.</v>

10
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like a different life for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a different life for you.</v>

11
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Think about how much has changed for</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of us in that time,</v>

12
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:34.680
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like another planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an alternate universe of the day</v>

13
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>before the election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is in a lot of ways,</v>

14
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people are,</v>

15
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.100
<v Speaker 1>the world's going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

16
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's trying to find its footing.</v>

17
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.033
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

18
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.790
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to tell you jail.</v>

19
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are a little piece of the</v>

20
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>finding of the footing because people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are finding the footing.</v>

21
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on tour repeaters in right now.</v>

22
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>I just got in this morning from Atlanta</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like there is,</v>

23
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>without being hyperbolic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is some kind of awakening</v>

24
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are kinda getting their shit</v>

25
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of sorting out things there</v>

26
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>through long form conversations like</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all having and all these people</v>

27
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>that we're now connected with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something happening where people</v>

28
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:19.510
<v Speaker 1>are going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another way to make sense and</v>

29
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>let me figure out what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean we have all the answers</v>

30
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>and I can sure as hell no I don't and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think you think you do either,</v>

31
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>but we're at least giving them a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>room to figure it out and it's pretty</v>

32
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:28.621
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>the thing about Peterson that's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating is how many people</v>

34
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:36.321
<v Speaker 1>misrepresent what he says to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>frame him him in a way that makes him</v>

35
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.690
<v Speaker 1>evil and mix their position seem more</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical or more moral or better or more</v>

36
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>intellectual.</v>

37
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>There's so many articles being written</v>
<v Speaker 1>about him almost on a daily basis.</v>

38
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>It is misrepresent what he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's epic bullshit.</v>

39
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

40
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>These guys want clicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all they want.</v>

41
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

42
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>we've done about 20 shows in the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>six weeks or so,</v>

43
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>bounced around from Nashville and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Houston and Atlanta and Chicago and</v>

44
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>everywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowds have been incredible.</v>

45
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably split,</v>

46
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first off they always go,</v>

47
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:07.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's angry white men.</v>

48
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the main thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all angry white men.</v>

49
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:10.434
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first off,</v>

50
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.870
<v Speaker 1>let's say it was all angry white men</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

51
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>that in and of itself doesn't mean it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

52
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Let's say there was like a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>disaffected group of angry white men</v>

53
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>that really felt like by their</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity had been compromised or they</v>

54
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get jobs or they didn't feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>good about their lives.</v>

55
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Like if there was someone talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them that was helping them,</v>

56
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>that would actually be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's just put that aside,</v>

57
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause they don't mean it in a positive</v>

58
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:34.220
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they say it's all angry white.</v>

59
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>But now I can tell you it's about 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 male to female,</v>

60
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.170
<v Speaker 1>roughly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.160
<v Speaker 1>at Jordan shows Jordan shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.310
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that's like dates that</v>

63
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.890
<v Speaker 1>reluctantly go along with men?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like right.</v>

64
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>There are some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there will be guys that you will,</v>

65
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>he's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually girls will come up to me after</v>

66
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:50.191
<v Speaker 1>and they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>he's a big fan of you guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he loves Jordan are he loves you or Blah</v>

68
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Blah Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just here.</v>

69
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Speaker 1>But then they all have a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm telling you,</v>

70
00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>this thing has been insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love</v>

71
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 2>Fest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you saw the video that Jordan</v>

72
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 2>posted last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was his birthday last night.</v>

73
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 2>We were at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the hell was I?</v>

74
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Tabernacle in Atlanta,</v>

75
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 3000 people singing happy</v>

76
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 2>birthday to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We brought out this freaking stuffed</v>

77
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 2>lobster and a and a piece of meat cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on this crazy meat diet now and</v>

78
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an endless love fest.</v>

79
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 2>Every street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We walked down,</v>

80
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 2>people high five and us saying hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did a little meet and greet impromptu</v>

81
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 2>thing at the Lincoln memorial and about</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred people showed up just out of</v>

82
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 2>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like these people are just</v>

83
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not white supremacists.</v>

84
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 2>They're not all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't hate women.</v>

85
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 2>It is literally nothing that they say</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they want clicks.</v>

86
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 2>And the way they get clicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

87
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they get clicks because they</v>

88
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 2>saved the absolute reverse from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

89
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not that they lie a little bit like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little lie.</v>

90
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 2>I think nobody would even pick up on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't think that's what they do.</v>

91
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 2>I think they're just misrepresenting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're,</v>

92
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 2>they're saying the APPS,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposite of the truth.</v>

93
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.910
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just look there.</v>

94
00:03:56.911 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 2>They're finding these little categories</v>
<v Speaker 2>like homophobia,</v>

95
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 2>transphobia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a homophobe,</v>

96
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 2>he's on tour with a gay guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not a transplant.</v>

97
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 2>There are trans people that show up</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

98
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:09.940
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I discussed it with him every</v>

99
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.181
<v Speaker 2>freaking night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked,</v>

100
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>

101
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 2>So I basically do like 15 minutes of</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up,</v>

102
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 2>up top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does an hour and a half and then we</v>

103
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 2>do a q and a together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

104
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.620
<v Speaker 2>and we bring out all of these things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>every night to clear it up and sometimes</v>

105
00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I'll have people bro bust out their</v>
<v Speaker 2>phones and I'll be like,</v>

106
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:24.230
<v Speaker 2>why don't you guys record this tonight?</v>

107
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 2>Let's get it out on twitter where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes down the alt right because he</v>

108
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 2>hates the identity politics of the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as the identity politics of the</v>

109
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:32.421
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

110
00:04:32.421 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason we all focus on the</v>

111
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 2>thing of the left is because it has</v>
<v Speaker 2>encompassed culture in media and</v>

112
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 2>politics and what you're allowed to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

113
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.040
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>universities and all of that.</v>

114
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 2>So it makes more sense to focus on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The little sliver of it that's on the</v>

115
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:48.100
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

116
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 2>It's Shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible.</v>

117
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 2>You should not look at your skin color</v>
<v Speaker 2>as some great thing that makes you</v>

118
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 2>better or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's sort of right thing,</v>

119
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:56.640
<v Speaker 2>is racism always a right thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

120
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all racists,</v>

121
00:04:57.941 --> 00:04:58.571
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

122
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I think the left is far more racist than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right at this moment.</v>

123
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that?</v>

124
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.410
<v Speaker 2>Because identity politics is based in</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>

125
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 2>You happen to be white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know nothing about you by the color of</v>

126
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:11.680
<v Speaker 2>your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know about Joe Rogan because I watched</v>

127
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:12.820
<v Speaker 2>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to the show.</v>

128
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 2>We've done this several times and we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the hours that we're going to sit</v>

129
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 2>here now we can dive as deep into any</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue and that's the only way that I can</v>

130
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 2>sensibly judge you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea that you will look at</v>

131
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 2>people that you would look at a black</v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

132
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:28.040
<v Speaker 2>a black person will be sitting there or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Muslim person will be sitting there</v>

133
00:05:28.041 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 2>are transports and sitting there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd go,</v>

134
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I have even an inkling of what you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that immutable characteristic</v>

135
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 2>that is actual racism that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>prejudging,</v>

136
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Judging first before you know somebody.</v>

137
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.190
<v Speaker 2>So I have a much bigger issue with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that has infected everything in</v>

138
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 2>American society right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The identity politics of the right,</v>

139
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 2>that this should be a white ethno state</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

140
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 2>But it's that of course it's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not really the identity politics</v>

141
00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:57.274
<v Speaker 2>of the right.</v>

142
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the left is necessarily</v>

143
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 1>that way either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

144
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I think the identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real issue,</v>

145
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people that only identify with</v>

146
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 1>other women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women that only identify with women and</v>

147
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>don't care about men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a real issue with people that</v>

148
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 1>are a only American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't care about the rest of the</v>

149
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

150
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.090
<v Speaker 1>there's all these weird groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we run into problems when we</v>

151
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:20.871
<v Speaker 1>start saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

152
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>it's the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's doing this as the right that's</v>

153
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just tribal.</v>

154
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 1>It's just this weird thing that human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings tend to gravitate towards.</v>

155
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Crow tribes for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

156
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 1>we can we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I talk about things usually from a</v>

157
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 1>little more of a political lens then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you do.</v>

158
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

159
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately it is tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However you want to parse that</v>

160
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:41.630
<v Speaker 1>tribalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

161
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.590
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the law,</v>

162
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 1>and I say this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the left right thing doesn't make</v>

163
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 1>that much sense anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're either basically,</v>

164
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>you're basically for freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're for the individual to live</v>

165
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 1>freely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however they see fit or you believe that</v>

166
00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:57.230
<v Speaker 1>the government should engineer things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that there should be central</v>

167
00:06:57.231 --> 00:06:59.810
<v Speaker 1>planning so that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's always shitty thinking.</v>

168
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 1>I think that people that say that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government should engineer things,</v>

169
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 1>they're just looking for a solution and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they think the government should</v>

170
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:07.290
<v Speaker 1>handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

171
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I think we should pay more taxes or is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that going to go,</v>

172
00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>it's going to go to the government and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it you're agreeing with me?</v>

173
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of,</v>

174
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.450
<v Speaker 1>oh okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you said no,</v>

175
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 1>no me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your thinking.</v>

176
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean their shift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're having shitty thinking.</v>

177
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like this idea that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government's going to fix it.</v>

178
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>The government is filled with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we don't have our own individual</v>

179
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:27.320
<v Speaker 1>solutions so we don't have a solution as</v>
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

180
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Just as human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective human beings looking at</v>

181
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would we ever think that elected</v>

182
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 1>officials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

183
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.560
<v Speaker 1>these people that are for the most part</v>
<v Speaker 1>full of shit,</v>

184
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.100
<v Speaker 1>like they're just trying to say whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can say that's going to appease</v>

185
00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 1>both the special interest groups and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lobbyists and the people that are</v>

186
00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 1>helping them get into place and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to vote for them and you know,</v>

187
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 1>and then just sort of like skirt around</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other issues that are</v>

188
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 1>controversial to the point where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get into office named three</v>

189
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:58.490
<v Speaker 1>politicians that you really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any of them.</v>

190
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:59.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

191
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.290
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Gary Johnson who is like,</v>

192
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.870
<v Speaker 1>who I like him too and I've heard it</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

193
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 1>but he was the worst possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian candidate,</v>

194
00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the best libertarian candidate?</v>

195
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean ran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul should be,</v>

196
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:16.400
<v Speaker 1>if he really had the balls to be what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to learn how to stuff it</v>

197
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 1>takedown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

198
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.040
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a lot right guys coming at you</v>

199
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to figure out a way to sprawl.</v>

200
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.500
<v Speaker 1>You could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do two hours with him and he'd</v>

201
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 1>be a lot better and a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he should be the guy but he doesn't</v>

202
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:32.810
<v Speaker 1>have the balls to do it because he wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to maintain being a Republican senator</v>

203
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:35.240
<v Speaker 1>in Kentucky and he's not going to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he has to leave the party.</v>

204
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.420
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen a major shift I think in</v>

205
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Republicans or at least conservatives or</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally people on the right,</v>

206
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:46.820
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a massive libertarian streak</v>

207
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.810
<v Speaker 1>that is alive in them right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why most of the people that I</v>

208
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:54.380
<v Speaker 1>liked these days that I get along with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think are fair and decent and</v>

209
00:08:54.381 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 1>honest are pretty much libertarian.</v>

210
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Define Libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian,</v>

211
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 2>so libertarian or classical liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I get more than anything</v>

212
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:02.400
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I say I'm a classical liberal,</v>

213
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 2>which basically means you believe in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

214
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 2>The sovereignty of the individual is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple most important thing.</v>

215
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.510
<v Speaker 2>It is your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is your duty to do what you see fit.</v>

216
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.770
<v Speaker 2>The government is supposed to do pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>much nothing other than protect your</v>

217
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:18.240
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's supposed to have an army and</v>

218
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 2>police and stuff like that and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>really just laissez faire economics and</v>

219
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the difference between</v>

220
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:28.140
<v Speaker 2>classical liberal and Libertarian is how</v>
<v Speaker 2>far do you want to go with the</v>

221
00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there is some utility for the</v>

222
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the more I do this,</v>

223
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 2>the more I have these conversations and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to ann caps and real</v>

224
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:41.181
<v Speaker 2>libertarians and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that hard to defend the state at</v>

225
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 2>almost any level at this point.</v>

226
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 2>But I do think that because I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live in Mad Max fury road just yet,</v>

227
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:49.770
<v Speaker 2>although we may be heading there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still will defend the state at some</v>

228
00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would say everything should be</v>

229
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.700
<v Speaker 2>local.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have an incredible experiment here</v>

230
00:09:53.701 --> 00:09:56.460
<v Speaker 2>with 50 states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your state taxes too high,</v>

231
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 2>move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go somewhere else.</v>

232
00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.730
<v Speaker 2>If your state doesn't have good</v>
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>

233
00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 2>you can go somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't like the weather somewhere.</v>

234
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Speaker 2>But the second we make everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>federal,</v>

235
00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:05.850
<v Speaker 2>and this is what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just the left.</v>

236
00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 2>This is what people who were using lazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that you referred to,</v>

237
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.510
<v Speaker 2>they think we should just have one law</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we should all live exactly the</v>

238
00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:14.610
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter where we are geographically,</v>

239
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:18.900
<v Speaker 2>no matter what our religion or what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However we set our set of uses,</v>

240
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.620
<v Speaker 2>that is a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a nightmare for a totalitarian</v>

241
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 2>state because if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the federal government,</v>

242
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.850
<v Speaker 2>if one government controls everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

243
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 2>If you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to leave the country.</v>

244
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to Mexico,</v>

245
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:31.920
<v Speaker 2>go to Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably won't like it.</v>

246
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:35.550
<v Speaker 2>They're really referring to like in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of like you want subtle laws.</v>

247
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Well because you want states' rights you</v>
<v Speaker 2>should care about is state,</v>

248
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.381
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

249
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:43.140
<v Speaker 2>we live in California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are taxed out the fucking Wazoo.</v>

250
00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:45.720
<v Speaker 2>I bought a house last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my first time at 41 years old that</v>

251
00:10:45.721 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 2>I owned property in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made it.</v>

252
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.340
<v Speaker 2>I own property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to tell you about my</v>

253
00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:51.870
<v Speaker 2>property taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're insane.</v>

254
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.030
<v Speaker 2>They're very high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're absurdly,</v>

255
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:56.610
<v Speaker 2>absurdly high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the price you pay for living in a</v>

256
00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:58.260
<v Speaker 2>spot where everybody wants to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

257
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 2>but that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the beauty,</v>

258
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:01.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like there's a trade off there.</v>

259
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.330
<v Speaker 2>Now I could move to Texas and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>property taxes would be way low and</v>

260
00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:10.290
<v Speaker 2>maybe because they don't tax as much the</v>
<v Speaker 2>schools are and as good or a series of</v>

261
00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:12.750
<v Speaker 2>other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the beauty of the foot vote.</v>

262
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.730
<v Speaker 2>You can go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an experiment,</v>

263
00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:16.530
<v Speaker 2>this thing in American who's against</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

264
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Anyone that wants to keep giving more</v>
<v Speaker 2>power to the federal government,</v>

265
00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:22.980
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty much everybody these</v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

266
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.520
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much everybody in mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly all of the Democrats,</v>

267
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.830
<v Speaker 2>all of you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

268
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.820
<v Speaker 2>the mainstream set of Democrats and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie and the progressive crew.</v>

269
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.090
<v Speaker 2>They would love for the federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>government to control everything and</v>

270
00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:39.300
<v Speaker 2>that is an absolute nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an absolute no control.</v>

271
00:11:39.301 --> 00:11:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Everything like how so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they want to control all economics,</v>

272
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.640
<v Speaker 2>department of Education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a configure out,</v>

273
00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:46.680
<v Speaker 2>all the environmental regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those things.</v>

274
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.620
<v Speaker 2>I would kick back everything to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>states,</v>

275
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 2>let the states decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't like it,</v>

276
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.200
<v Speaker 2>get going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

277
00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a beautiful thing.</v>

278
00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really care about marijuana and</v>

279
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:58.750
<v Speaker 2>you live in Alabama right now and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not legal,</v>

280
00:11:58.751 --> 00:11:59.584
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

281
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 2>Go to Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to California.</v>

282
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

283
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 2>that's how you'll influence things</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can move your family,</v>

284
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:09.160
<v Speaker 2>your value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you bring to your community in</v>

285
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:10.270
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

286
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.000
<v Speaker 2>think about it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If California just kept taxing higher</v>

287
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:15.390
<v Speaker 2>and higher and kept screwing up a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

288
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.970
<v Speaker 2>a ton that's going wrong in the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually Joe Rogan might be like,</v>

289
00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just built this freaking kick ass new</v>

290
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:22.960
<v Speaker 2>studio here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm now paying,</v>

291
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of dollars in</v>

292
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:28.240
<v Speaker 2>taxes and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might want to try it somewhere else</v>

293
00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 2>where they're going to tax you less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the beauty of the thing.</v>

294
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:32.230
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to leave the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

295
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.410
<v Speaker 2>the federal government should pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>much do nothing.</v>

296
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.200
<v Speaker 2>It should make sure we're not warring</v>
<v Speaker 2>with each other that the states aren't</v>

297
00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 2>warring that's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then protect the borders.</v>

298
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to do a lot.</v>

299
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Leave it to the states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let look if you had a problem here,</v>

300
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.630
<v Speaker 2>you know you're a sewage leak right</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside,</v>

301
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 2>you want the federal government to deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that or do you want the local</v>

302
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Speaker 2>municipality to deal with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want everything to be as local as</v>

303
00:12:55.481 --> 00:12:57.370
<v Speaker 2>possible because that's how you'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>influence things.</v>

304
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 2>And that's how you as an individual will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be empowered.</v>

305
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.490
<v Speaker 2>And that's all I have.</v>

306
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.961
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

307
00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:04.590
<v Speaker 3>hearing what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just not hearing this,</v>

308
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.190
<v Speaker 3>this clamoring for the government to</v>
<v Speaker 3>take care of everything.</v>

309
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear,</v>

310
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.420
<v Speaker 3>you heard a little bit from Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

311
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.950
<v Speaker 3>but I just think again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of that is like,</v>

312
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.550
<v Speaker 3>it's not doing it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that the solution would</v>

313
00:13:17.551 --> 00:13:21.150
<v Speaker 3>be if the government takes over and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>take more rich people's taxes,</v>

314
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he will spout off about income</v>

315
00:13:23.341 --> 00:13:26.130
<v Speaker 3>inequality and take that money and</v>
<v Speaker 3>redistribute it.</v>

316
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.200
<v Speaker 3>And then somehow or another that's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fix everything.</v>

317
00:13:28.201 --> 00:13:29.730
<v Speaker 3>But it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just going to make government</v>

318
00:13:29.731 --> 00:13:31.260
<v Speaker 3>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have more jobs,</v>

319
00:13:31.261 --> 00:13:32.910
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna have more jobs in</v>
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>

320
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.040
<v Speaker 3>red tape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more bureaucrats,</v>

321
00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:36.600
<v Speaker 3>more bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're agreeing with,</v>

322
00:13:36.601 --> 00:13:37.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

323
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most part.</v>

324
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they look,</v>

325
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:42.280
<v Speaker 2>you want to give free college education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone first off,</v>

326
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.900
<v Speaker 2>it's not free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that it's just,</v>

327
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.330
<v Speaker 2>this is just stupid lazy thinking to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is free.</v>

328
00:13:46.331 --> 00:13:48.500
<v Speaker 2>It's not free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to pay the janitor and you got</v>

329
00:13:48.501 --> 00:13:49.780
<v Speaker 2>to pray the professors and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

330
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.910
<v Speaker 3>well they mean free for students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

331
00:13:51.911 --> 00:13:55.800
<v Speaker 3>the idea of being that our taxes instead</v>
<v Speaker 3>of going towards the military,</v>

332
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.760
<v Speaker 3>they would go towards education.</v>

333
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they should at least be honest and</v>

334
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:02.140
<v Speaker 2>say that because a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just hear free and you just think</v>

335
00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:04.840
<v Speaker 2>it's free but it's not free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You obviously have to pay for it.</v>

336
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.710
<v Speaker 2>But also we're moving into an economy</v>
<v Speaker 2>where robots are taking over automa</v>

337
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.420
<v Speaker 2>automation is taking over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to,</v>

338
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.270
<v Speaker 2>you know what I think Mcdonald's said</v>
<v Speaker 2>within five years it's all going to be</v>

339
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.450
<v Speaker 2>ipads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to half the Mcdonald's and you know,</v>

340
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:19.170
<v Speaker 2>a fast food places in airports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's all ipad.</v>

341
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.250
<v Speaker 2>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you're going to the government,</v>

342
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:24.070
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't do anything right or well</v>
<v Speaker 2>or efficiently,</v>

343
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.210
<v Speaker 2>the more they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

344
00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:27.280
<v Speaker 2>private business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to spend more on</v>

345
00:14:27.281 --> 00:14:29.530
<v Speaker 2>employees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then all these businesses are just</v>

346
00:14:29.531 --> 00:14:31.780
<v Speaker 2>going to figure out ways which they</v>
<v Speaker 2>should do.</v>

347
00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:33.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's ingenuity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

348
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.090
<v Speaker 2>They will figure out ways to save costs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>save expenses,</v>

349
00:14:37.091 --> 00:14:40.300
<v Speaker 2>and then less people will be hired and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then at the same time we're going to be</v>

350
00:14:40.301 --> 00:14:42.940
<v Speaker 2>subsidized and all of these people to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to college.</v>

351
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.580
<v Speaker 2>We're often in college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're learning nothing and gender</v>

352
00:14:45.581 --> 00:14:49.120
<v Speaker 2>studies and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of these other crazy classes and</v>

353
00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to have this set of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have no real skills</v>

354
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.440
<v Speaker 4>and we're going to set up businesses</v>
<v Speaker 4>that will never want to hire them</v>

355
00:14:54.441 --> 00:14:56.720
<v Speaker 4>because the government is going to tell</v>
<v Speaker 4>them how much to pay.</v>

356
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have employees here,</v>

357
00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:00.170
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you pay them what you think is fair and</v>

358
00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:01.730
<v Speaker 4>if they don't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have to.</v>

359
00:15:01.731 --> 00:15:03.560
<v Speaker 4>But imagine if the government came in</v>
<v Speaker 4>and was like,</v>

360
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.940
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to pay your guys</v>

361
00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:07.040
<v Speaker 4>this amount.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>

362
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 4>Well think how many people would love to</v>
<v Speaker 4>work for you for free.</v>

363
00:15:09.981 --> 00:15:11.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you get emails every day as I</v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

364
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't stalker.</v>

365
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want people to work for me for</v>

366
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:18.950
<v Speaker 4>free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like the interns,</v>

367
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:22.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't like the idea of it silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you're a small business owner.</v>

368
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:25.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you should be able to do whatever</v>

369
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:27.440
<v Speaker 4>with your business and your property</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you want.</v>

370
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 4>It's as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

371
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:35.410
<v Speaker 4>I think we get real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of cliche terms and one of</v>

372
00:15:36.441 --> 00:15:40.100
<v Speaker 4>them is like that people who go to</v>
<v Speaker 4>college or studying gender studies or</v>

373
00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:42.770
<v Speaker 4>lesbian dance theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how much of that is really</v>

374
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:43.601
<v Speaker 4>happening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the man,</v>

375
00:15:43.601 --> 00:15:46.610
<v Speaker 4>it's very small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does exist in some weird states.</v>

376
00:15:46.611 --> 00:15:51.590
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm sure you're aware of that lady</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was the professor from Fresno State</v>

377
00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:52.580
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

378
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.440
<v Speaker 4>got in trouble recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So many of them.</v>

379
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:57.890
<v Speaker 4>Which one was his?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some big lady was talking a bunch of</v>

380
00:15:57.891 --> 00:16:00.380
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just there and she said she could</v>

381
00:16:00.381 --> 00:16:03.540
<v Speaker 4>never get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't fire that lane.</v>

382
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of them.</v>

383
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a lot of really wacky</v>
<v Speaker 4>professors out there that do have</v>

384
00:16:07.551 --> 00:16:08.181
<v Speaker 4>tenure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

385
00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:11.330
<v Speaker 4>That woman was tweeting out some bananas</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and she has tenure and she's not</v>

386
00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:12.164
<v Speaker 4>going to go anywhere.</v>

387
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.600
<v Speaker 4>There's universities all over the</v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

388
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.370
<v Speaker 4>They're constantly teaching kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

389
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.540
<v Speaker 4>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are there.</v>

390
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.080
<v Speaker 4>It's a small percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a small percentage,</v>

391
00:16:21.081 --> 00:16:26.081
<v Speaker 4>but they have way over influence on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of people.</v>

392
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.820
<v Speaker 4>They have scared the majority into</v>
<v Speaker 4>silence.</v>

393
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:29.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how often you're doing</v>

394
00:16:29.901 --> 00:16:31.390
<v Speaker 4>colleges these days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't do it.</v>

395
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing them all the time and what I</v>
<v Speaker 4>find,</v>

396
00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:35.690
<v Speaker 4>so I did this thing at University of New</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hampshire.</v>

397
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.880
<v Speaker 4>We posted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>saw it,</v>

398
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.110
<v Speaker 4>so look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they first off,</v>

399
00:16:39.111 --> 00:16:41.390
<v Speaker 4>what they did was they were supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be about 300 people there.</v>

400
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.890
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at first,</v>

401
00:16:42.891 --> 00:16:45.890
<v Speaker 4>because of the protestors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the school said we can't secure a room.</v>

402
00:16:45.891 --> 00:16:48.440
<v Speaker 4>So thinking what are they protesting you</v>
<v Speaker 4>about?</v>

403
00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.480
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was split technically I was supposed</v>

404
00:16:50.481 --> 00:16:54.290
<v Speaker 4>to be there that day with candace owens</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Charlie Kirk from turning point and</v>

405
00:16:54.291 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 4>we were going to talk about cultural</v>
<v Speaker 4>appropriation and you know,</v>

406
00:16:56.571 --> 00:16:58.010
<v Speaker 4>some of the hot hot button stuff.</v>

407
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.730
<v Speaker 4>So I don't even know that they all were</v>
<v Speaker 4>there to protest me specifically.</v>

408
00:17:01.731 --> 00:17:04.160
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that day was the day that can,</v>

409
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.070
<v Speaker 4>and Charlie ended up on TMZ with Kanye,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they bailed on me and just left the</v>

410
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.020
<v Speaker 4>left me for the wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were on Tmz with Kanya.</v>

411
00:17:11.021 --> 00:17:12.980
<v Speaker 4>We've been just a couple of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

412
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.410
<v Speaker 4>Kanye showed up at the TMC offices with</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

413
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.340
<v Speaker 4>So they just showed up with him and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>blew off there.</v>

414
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all good appearance.</v>

415
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all right.</v>

416
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.830
<v Speaker 4>When was it was me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was me and university of New</v>

417
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:26.400
<v Speaker 4>Hampshire or Kanye and TMZ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

418
00:17:26.401 --> 00:17:29.540
<v Speaker 4>But they had a schedule like they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be there and they just</v>

419
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:33.650
<v Speaker 4>decided not to run again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the people like paid to have you</v>

420
00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:34.190
<v Speaker 4>come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

421
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.970
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

422
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.460
<v Speaker 4>And they were supposed to be paid to go</v>
<v Speaker 4>to come to think of it.</v>

423
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.010
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get more money for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is ridiculous.</v>

424
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.500
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing's ridiculous that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>would just blow that off.</v>

425
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.760
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a Gig.</v>

426
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.450
<v Speaker 4>You don't blow off a gig because Kanye</v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to go on the gossip show.</v>

427
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But now you're fucking stupid.</v>

428
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 4>Or what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you're talking to me like as a</v>

429
00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:51.241
<v Speaker 4>comic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

430
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:51.931
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

431
00:17:51.931 --> 00:17:53.370
<v Speaker 4>we wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a different,</v>

432
00:17:53.371 --> 00:17:54.810
<v Speaker 4>you don't blow off a Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

433
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.180
<v Speaker 4>It's just a different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but come to see you don't just decide,</v>

434
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.100
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this gig is better for me right now.</v>

435
00:17:59.120 --> 00:17:59.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just curious.</v>

436
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:04.910
<v Speaker 4>With Kanye on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hi Harvey Harvey that they spent time</v>

437
00:18:04.981 --> 00:18:07.880
<v Speaker 4>with Harvey Levin instead of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

438
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.550
<v Speaker 4>he seems like a nice enough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

439
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.970
<v Speaker 4>This business is a little shady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

440
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.520
<v Speaker 4>But the whole thing behind it is you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

441
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:19.320
<v Speaker 4>you don't cancel a gig because he got</v>
<v Speaker 4>another Gig that you think is better for</v>

442
00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:20.670
<v Speaker 4>you last minute.</v>

443
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.620
<v Speaker 4>Like that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's that phrase,</v>

444
00:18:22.621 --> 00:18:24.150
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The show must go on.</v>

445
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to go on.</v>

446
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:26.783
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

447
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.860
<v Speaker 4>So I saw you getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

448
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.950
<v Speaker 4>was that the lady that the coins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the jar,</v>

449
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.710
<v Speaker 4>they brought noise makers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were slamming on shit.</v>

450
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:37.050
<v Speaker 4>They were screaming things where it's so</v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous.</v>

451
00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:39.400
<v Speaker 4>Like you would let them talk and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't have any to say.</v>

452
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:40.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean the best part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So first off,</v>

453
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.770
<v Speaker 4>300 people supposed to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say we can't secure a room on</v>

454
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:45.450
<v Speaker 4>campus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So think about what a defeat that is.</v>

455
00:18:45.451 --> 00:18:47.310
<v Speaker 4>So this is where you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

456
00:18:47.311 --> 00:18:50.640
<v Speaker 4>it's a minority of students,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but think how they affect the majority.</v>

457
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.790
<v Speaker 4>That meant that the University of New</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hampshire,</v>

458
00:18:52.791 --> 00:18:57.030
<v Speaker 4>it's a pretty solid school in the live</v>
<v Speaker 4>free or state live free or die state.</v>

459
00:18:57.031 --> 00:19:00.270
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They could not secure because I'm</v>

460
00:19:00.271 --> 00:19:01.980
<v Speaker 4>showing up a room on their campus.</v>

461
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.230
<v Speaker 4>So that's already a massive loss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you,</v>

462
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.060
<v Speaker 4>when you say could not secure you mean</v>
<v Speaker 4>safety wise,</v>

463
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.980
<v Speaker 4>he said they could not secure it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Safety wise.</v>

464
00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:09.900
<v Speaker 4>There were too many threats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the hell that means.</v>

465
00:19:09.901 --> 00:19:13.800
<v Speaker 4>Twitter chat or other non,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so candice and the other guy are gone.</v>

466
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.330
<v Speaker 4>So it's just you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

467
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.880
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Gay Libertarian Guy.</v>

468
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.190
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too dangerous.</v>

469
00:19:20.191 --> 00:19:21.450
<v Speaker 4>Too dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too crazy.</v>

470
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.520
<v Speaker 4>Like what is he going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to,</v>

471
00:19:23.521 --> 00:19:25.410
<v Speaker 4>we're going to have to silence him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

472
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.570
<v Speaker 4>Well I flipped the script on their</v>
<v Speaker 4>heads.</v>

473
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:28.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it comes down to.</v>

474
00:19:28.891 --> 00:19:32.010
<v Speaker 4>Like they don't know what the fuck to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make of me because I don't play their</v>

475
00:19:32.011 --> 00:19:34.050
<v Speaker 4>game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just doing what I think is</v>

476
00:19:34.051 --> 00:19:35.580
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'm a freaking rocket</v>

477
00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:37.260
<v Speaker 4>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'm some massive</v>

478
00:19:37.261 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 4>intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm someone that can communicate</v>

479
00:19:39.841 --> 00:19:41.220
<v Speaker 4>these ideas pretty well.</v>

480
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.900
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and hopefully we'll talk about it.</v>

481
00:19:42.901 --> 00:19:44.730
<v Speaker 4>But I'm back in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stand up now like I'm doing,</v>

482
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm just doing what I think is right on</v>
<v Speaker 4>this planet while I'm here.</v>

483
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.040
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when you do these speeches,</v>

484
00:19:50.041 --> 00:19:51.990
<v Speaker 4>what do you do when you go to these</v>
<v Speaker 4>colleges?</v>

485
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:53.070
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I get up there,</v>

486
00:19:53.071 --> 00:19:56.940
<v Speaker 4>so they move it from this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the university 300 seat room.</v>

487
00:19:56.941 --> 00:20:00.690
<v Speaker 4>They move it to a hockey rink of 7,500</v>
<v Speaker 4>seats.</v>

488
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.870
<v Speaker 4>So think how absurd this absurd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is 300 people and they're in a,</v>

489
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.320
<v Speaker 4>how many people are in the audience?</v>
<v Speaker 4>300 people.</v>

490
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So apparently they didn't apparently</v>

491
00:20:10.141 --> 00:20:12.150
<v Speaker 4>like another hundred supporters of mine</v>
<v Speaker 4>showed up,</v>

492
00:20:12.151 --> 00:20:14.760
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't even let them in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even though they were roughly 7,000,</v>

493
00:20:14.761 --> 00:20:17.070
<v Speaker 4>100 empty seats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why wouldn't they let him in?</v>

494
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.530
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause at that point security starts,</v>

495
00:20:19.531 --> 00:20:20.610
<v Speaker 4>everything just gets whacked.</v>

496
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean this happens at every college</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

497
00:20:22.261 --> 00:20:24.300
<v Speaker 4>Like nobody knows who's in charge</v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore,</v>

498
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just like this big cluster fuck.</v>

499
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.070
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they put up a step and repeat with</v>

500
00:20:29.071 --> 00:20:31.170
<v Speaker 4>the turning point symbol behind me and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing my thing.</v>

501
00:20:31.171 --> 00:20:33.090
<v Speaker 4>But there's a freaking Sam bony back</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

502
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell am I doing?</v>

503
00:20:34.411 --> 00:20:37.080
<v Speaker 4>Like this is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And turning point is that conservative</v>

504
00:20:37.081 --> 00:20:40.710
<v Speaker 4>think tank things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're the largest conservative,</v>

505
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:41.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>college.</v>

506
00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.850
<v Speaker 4>A nonprofit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why do they have that behind you?</v>

507
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause he was sponsored by them.</v>

508
00:20:46.351 --> 00:20:47.900
<v Speaker 4>Charlie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Charlie runs turning points.</v>

509
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

510
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't even have the fucking show</v>

511
00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:53.290
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was either that that then goes,</v>

512
00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:54.430

<v Speaker 2>I sit literally,</v>

513
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:55.890
<v Speaker 2>I stand there and literally in front of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

514
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.760
<v Speaker 2>6,000 seats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

515
00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

516
00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for,</v>

517
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.930
<v Speaker 2>for them to figure out why they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

518
00:21:01.931 --> 00:21:04.900
<v Speaker 2>But Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>7,000 empty seats.</v>

519
00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:06.940
<v Speaker 2>I do my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked for about a half hour and I</v>

520
00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:08.400
<v Speaker 2>knew they were a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

521
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.710
<v Speaker 2>250 of those kids were there to listen</v>
<v Speaker 2>and agree or disagree.</v>

522
00:21:11.711 --> 00:21:12.311
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it.</v>

523
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:13.930
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the conservative group.</v>

524
00:21:13.931 --> 00:21:16.780
<v Speaker 2>They're bringing a gay married guy who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>pro pod,</v>

525
00:21:16.781 --> 00:21:19.240
<v Speaker 2>who's pro euthanasia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's against the death penalty for</v>

526
00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:21.340
<v Speaker 2>reforming the prison system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

527
00:21:21.341 --> 00:21:23.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm pro choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I could go on and on about the</v>

528
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:25.360
<v Speaker 2>liberal crowd that you and I don't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

529
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.801
<v Speaker 2>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

530
00:21:26.801 --> 00:21:28.450
<v Speaker 2>they're applauding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they,</v>

531
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.950
<v Speaker 2>what are they mad at you for?</v>

532
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

534
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.553
<v Speaker 2>they're mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

535
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 2>if they don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just want you to bow forever.</v>

536
00:21:36.581 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 2>They don't come to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to silence.</v>

537
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.920
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want to silence you about like</v>

538
00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:44.130
<v Speaker 2>what is it that they oppose that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying Joe,</v>

539
00:21:44.131 --> 00:21:48.340
<v Speaker 2>I w I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I they would scream or they'd</v>

540
00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:49.360
<v Speaker 2>start robotically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

541
00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:51.520
<v Speaker 2>they set timers and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>robotically chant.</v>

542
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.620
<v Speaker 2>We're not the problem or just some other</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense.</v>

543
00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.790
<v Speaker 2>We're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are not the problem we are.</v>

544
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.270
<v Speaker 2>I'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd look at them right in the eye and be</v>

545
00:21:58.271 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing right in front of you.</v>

546
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.770
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a question for me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there something that I said that</v>

547
00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:04.090
<v Speaker 2>upset you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any of that?</v>

548
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.220
<v Speaker 2>And they can't respond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

549
00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:09.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean they just can't respond because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not there to exchange ideas.</v>

550
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.610
<v Speaker 2>They believe they are oppressed and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>boo.</v>

551
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:13.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

552
00:22:13.361 --> 00:22:15.310
<v Speaker 2>I always go up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I say at every college thing I</v>

553
00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:17.140
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it.</v>

554
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you have it worse than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than your grandparents?</v>

555
00:22:19.211 --> 00:22:22.060
<v Speaker 2>I want everyone in this room to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about your grandparents right now and</v>

556
00:22:22.061 --> 00:22:26.290
<v Speaker 2>99.9% of people in America right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>have it better than their grandparents</v>

557
00:22:26.291 --> 00:22:27.700
<v Speaker 2>had it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you have it better than your</v>

558
00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:29.920
<v Speaker 2>grandparents had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have better than my grandparents had</v>

559
00:22:29.921 --> 00:22:31.210
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these kids,</v>

560
00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:34.450
<v Speaker 2>they're at University of New Hampshire</v>
<v Speaker 2>studying whatever the hell they want to</v>

561
00:22:34.451 --> 00:22:36.010
<v Speaker 2>study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have it better than their</v>

562
00:22:36.011 --> 00:22:38.650
<v Speaker 2>grandparents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that the power of thinking that</v>

563
00:22:38.651 --> 00:22:41.740
<v Speaker 2>you're oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of thinking that the world is</v>

564
00:22:41.741 --> 00:22:46.120
<v Speaker 2>warped against you is it's a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is truly a drug.</v>

565
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.830
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it turns out,</v>

566
00:22:47.831 --> 00:22:49.750
<v Speaker 2>did you see the exchange I got in with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Trans Woman?</v>

567
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it turns,</v>

568
00:22:51.131 --> 00:22:54.160
<v Speaker 2>so this trans woman is telling me to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck myself and whatever she's saying</v>

569
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.770
<v Speaker 2>and screaming along with everybody we'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>ship set about.</v>

570
00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Well cause I mentioned the Jordan</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson Pronoun thing and I said,</v>

571
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:01.450
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want trans people to be treated</v>

572
00:23:01.451 --> 00:23:04.060
<v Speaker 2>equally under the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want trans people to be respected.</v>

573
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.730
<v Speaker 2>I hope you find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally said to her looking right at</v>

574
00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:07.361
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope,</v>

575
00:23:07.361 --> 00:23:09.370
<v Speaker 2>I hope you find someone that loves you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your life.</v>

576
00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to be as equal and happy as</v>

577
00:23:12.071 --> 00:23:15.040
<v Speaker 2>anybody else on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what I want for you.</v>

578
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.410
<v Speaker 2>She's still telling me to go fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

579
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.420
<v Speaker 2>It turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know this till weeks later.</v>

580
00:23:19.421 --> 00:23:23.500
<v Speaker 2>I found this out about a week ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a professor of gender studies at</v>

581
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:26.440
<v Speaker 2>University of New Hampshire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's literally trying,</v>

582
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:31.540
<v Speaker 2>you have a professor that is part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>protesters and she's live tweeting the</v>

583
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:32.470
<v Speaker 2>thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

584
00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Dave Ruben.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

585
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.060
<v Speaker 2>so that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

586
00:23:35.061 --> 00:23:36.910
<v Speaker 2>when people think it's this little</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

587
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:37.660
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

588
00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 2>it's this little thing that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's metastasizing and spreading like</v>

589
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:43.720
<v Speaker 2>a cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I truly believe that identity</v>

590
00:23:43.721 --> 00:23:45.190
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this thing,</v>

591
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 2>I think is</v>

592
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.310
<v Speaker 4>the biggest threat to the west and to</v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom that exists.</v>

593
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:54.200
<v Speaker 4>Did you communicate with her at all?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I communicated her from with my mic and</v>

594
00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:56.480
<v Speaker 4>then was there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did she exchange say what?</v>

595
00:23:56.481 --> 00:23:59.570
<v Speaker 4>She has a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she kept yelling at me and people can</v>

596
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 4>have a video of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

597
00:24:01.221 --> 00:24:03.720
<v Speaker 4>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where it's probably maybe</v>

598
00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.810
<v Speaker 4>an hour in herself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

599
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.010
<v Speaker 4>I saw it and I just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh poor,</v>

600
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.860
<v Speaker 4>what's he dealing with?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a lot of pity for that,</v>

601
00:24:09.861 --> 00:24:11.080
<v Speaker 4>which was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

602
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:12.970
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was shaking the jar coins.</v>

603
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:13.813
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

604
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was really funny is that I realized</v>

605
00:24:17.241 --> 00:24:19.370
<v Speaker 4>that there's one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's one moment and I never lost</v>

606
00:24:19.371 --> 00:24:21.110
<v Speaker 4>my cool cause it's like it's a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids yelling</v>

607
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.490
<v Speaker 4>and as long as they're not going to take</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Samurai sword out and stab me or</v>

608
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:26.210
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it,</v>

609
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:26.780
<v Speaker 4>then it's fine.</v>

610
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.960
<v Speaker 4>But there was one moment where they just</v>
<v Speaker 4>kept going and going.</v>

611
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.840
<v Speaker 4>So I sarcastically said it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

612
00:24:32.841 --> 00:24:36.440
<v Speaker 4>guys shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it got a big laugh and then I</v>

613
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.860
<v Speaker 4>repeated it a couple times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then I realized that when the school</v>

614
00:24:39.861 --> 00:24:41.270
<v Speaker 4>newspaper wrote about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they said,</v>

615
00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:43.880
<v Speaker 4>and then Dave Ruben told them to shut</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck up.</v>

616
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.750
<v Speaker 4>Shut the fuck up is very different than</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut the fuck up.</v>

617
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.900
<v Speaker 4>So that was my one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my one lesson in there,</v>

618
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:57.200
<v Speaker 4>it seems like is the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She didn't want anything from me.</v>

619
00:24:57.201 --> 00:25:01.280
<v Speaker 4>She wanted me to be thrown out for doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that because if you are doing that,</v>

620
00:25:01.281 --> 00:25:03.560
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're disrupting a performance.</v>

621
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:05.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you would have a q and a with</v>

622
00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:06.561
<v Speaker 4>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

623
00:25:06.561 --> 00:25:08.000
<v Speaker 4>He'd be happy to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do it.</v>

624
00:25:08.001 --> 00:25:10.340
<v Speaker 4>And if they're a half hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I opened it up for q and a so let's do</v>

625
00:25:10.341 --> 00:25:11.480
<v Speaker 4>the rest of the last hour.</v>

626
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.730
<v Speaker 4>But you didn't even get a chance to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>to that with her.</v>

627
00:25:13.731 --> 00:25:15.550
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was already yelling at know and then</v>

628
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.610
<v Speaker 4>I think I even said to her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I did it.</v>

629
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.550
<v Speaker 4>Several people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure she was too.</v>

630
00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:23.050
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a question for me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think her last thing was your,</v>

631
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.460
<v Speaker 4>I hate you or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something to that effect.</v>

632
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is a professor should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she should be disqualified for teaching.</v>

633
00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:32.750
<v Speaker 4>She's an a logical thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not what you want raising your</v>

634
00:25:32.751 --> 00:25:33.560
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

635
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.200
<v Speaker 4>But essentially that's what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're still children.</v>

636
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.480
<v Speaker 4>You got this fucking dummy who can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>focus enough to have a coherent argument</v>

637
00:25:43.581 --> 00:25:45.950
<v Speaker 4>that they're yelling out in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your performance.</v>

638
00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.720
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the record,</v>

639
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:50.930
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>authorities or the police or the campus</v>

640
00:25:50.931 --> 00:25:51.770
<v Speaker 4>safety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was,</v>

641
00:25:51.771 --> 00:25:54.680
<v Speaker 4>did at one point try to have some people</v>
<v Speaker 4>sit down and be quiet.</v>

642
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.000
<v Speaker 4>And I was like guys don't worry about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

643
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.000
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess we could escalate it to that</v>

644
00:25:59.001 --> 00:26:01.520
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even want this video to be</v>

645
00:26:01.521 --> 00:26:04.460
<v Speaker 4>released when they videotape this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did not want it to be released cause I</v>

646
00:26:04.461 --> 00:26:07.210
<v Speaker 4>don't want to add fuel to the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to fix some of these products</v>

647
00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.180
<v Speaker 4>as part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

648
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:11.630
<v Speaker 4>Is that this becomes something that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>know that they can get a video of if</v>

649
00:26:11.631 --> 00:26:13.760
<v Speaker 4>they go to your next performance and</v>
<v Speaker 4>interrupt you.</v>

650
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:14.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know what?</v>

651
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they want one person over</v>
<v Speaker 4>to their side.</v>

652
00:26:17.001 --> 00:26:21.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't think one screaming lunatic who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who did not come to respect me even</v>

653
00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:24.350
<v Speaker 4>though I was there to respect them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they want anybody.</v>

654
00:26:24.351 --> 00:26:26.390
<v Speaker 4>I think I actually want a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>to my side.</v>

655
00:26:26.391 --> 00:26:28.250
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I know it cause I've received</v>

656
00:26:28.251 --> 00:26:29.180
<v Speaker 4>tons of emails about it.</v>

657
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.180
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think it's about winning to</v>

658
00:26:32.181 --> 00:26:34.520
<v Speaker 4>your side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's about other lunatics that</v>

659
00:26:34.521 --> 00:26:37.550
<v Speaker 4>realize that there's an opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get attention if they go to your show</v>

660
00:26:37.551 --> 00:26:38.750
<v Speaker 4>and yell things out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

661
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:42.170
<v Speaker 4>well that's why we ended up putting the</v>
<v Speaker 4>video up because a couple of them would</v>

662
00:26:42.171 --> 00:26:44.850
<v Speaker 4>put up these little clips,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very selectively edited that made it</v>

663
00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:48.030
<v Speaker 4>seem like I was doing things that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't like I was silencing them or just</v>

664
00:26:48.031 --> 00:26:49.710
<v Speaker 4>some other nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then finally I was like,</v>

665
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:51.480
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this is the way the Internet is and</v>

666
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 4>it just is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we'll just put up the whole thing</v>

667
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:56.130
<v Speaker 4>on edited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though I had 10 minutes before,</v>

668
00:26:56.131 --> 00:26:56.581
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

669
00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:58.530
<v Speaker 4>don't even record this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

670
00:26:58.531 --> 00:27:01.290
<v Speaker 4>don't even record this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because because Charlie and candice</v>

671
00:27:01.291 --> 00:27:03.240
<v Speaker 4>hadn't showed up and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's ridiculous.</v>

672
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.930
<v Speaker 4>I got 7,000 empty seats behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then once people start playing that</v>

673
00:27:06.931 --> 00:27:09.360
<v Speaker 4>game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can either just be the bitch,</v>

674
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.120
<v Speaker 4>which I refuse to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you can fight back.</v>

675
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird place to be because you</v>

676
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:19.410
<v Speaker 4>know what they're doing and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially just trying to rile you up.</v>

677
00:27:19.411 --> 00:27:21.840
<v Speaker 4>And if they're not willing to have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>real dialogue with you,</v>

678
00:27:21.841 --> 00:27:23.430
<v Speaker 4>they're just yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck Dave Rubin.</v>

679
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.040
<v Speaker 4>That really should disqualify you from</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a teacher.</v>

680
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the worst way to communicate.</v>

681
00:27:28.801 --> 00:27:31.800
<v Speaker 4>You're demonstrating that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking sucks and that you want to</v>

682
00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:34.860
<v Speaker 4>teach about gender studies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yet you know,</v>

683
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:35.743
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

684
00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:40.290
<v Speaker 4>you're interrupting a comp and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to claim transphobia or whatever</v>

685
00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:43.650
<v Speaker 4>the fuck he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she is trying to claim she,</v>

686
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.870
<v Speaker 4>it's a she right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

687
00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:49.650
<v Speaker 4>she's a trans woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she was a man not as a woman.</v>

688
00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

689
00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

690
00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:54.420
<v Speaker 4>I treated her with complete respect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's the thing,</v>

691
00:27:54.421 --> 00:27:55.530
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they truly,</v>

692
00:27:55.531 --> 00:27:58.530
<v Speaker 4>they want you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to put their foot on your neck</v>

693
00:27:58.531 --> 00:28:02.640
<v Speaker 4>and have you stay there forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why every time now that</v>

694
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.370
<v Speaker 4>somebody's mainstream writes something</v>
<v Speaker 4>about you,</v>

695
00:28:05.371 --> 00:28:08.280
<v Speaker 4>half the time they're calling you a</v>
<v Speaker 4>conservative cause they don't know what</v>

696
00:28:08.281 --> 00:28:13.281
<v Speaker 4>the fuck to do with this guy who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about drugs and all the crazy</v>

697
00:28:13.891 --> 00:28:15.090
<v Speaker 4>shit you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the time,</v>

698
00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:20.091
<v Speaker 4>but also you're woke enough to actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>identify there is a problem here with</v>

699
00:28:20.371 --> 00:28:23.580
<v Speaker 4>what's happening in the mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they can't categorize us in any</v>

700
00:28:23.581 --> 00:28:25.140
<v Speaker 4>sensible way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in a weird way,</v>

701
00:28:25.141 --> 00:28:28.350
<v Speaker 4>especially because me and you also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the nature of what we do,</v>

702
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.870
<v Speaker 4>we sit from people that are a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>scary.</v>

703
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.910
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you've had Jones on,</v>

704
00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:34.260
<v Speaker 4>I've had molyneux on I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

705
00:28:34.261 --> 00:28:36.150
<v Speaker 4>I had certain a bit John at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the beginning,</v>

706
00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.020
<v Speaker 4>and I'm sure you've had plenty of other</v>
<v Speaker 4>controversial people and it's like,</v>

707
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.300
<v Speaker 4>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an odd way that they want to</v>

708
00:28:42.301 --> 00:28:46.200
<v Speaker 4>look at the two of us more than other</v>
<v Speaker 4>people because we,</v>

709
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.800
<v Speaker 4>by the nature of our jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the nature of how we exist,</v>

710
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:50.880
<v Speaker 4>that's a threat.</v>

711
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.770
<v Speaker 4>If you want to control the way everybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks.</v>

712
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:54.391
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

713
00:28:54.391 --> 00:28:56.310
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to give people a</v>
<v Speaker 4>platform.</v>

714
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.330
<v Speaker 4>That's what I keep hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

715
00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:59.490
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what's your policy on that?</v>

716
00:28:59.491 --> 00:29:02.430
<v Speaker 4>Because that seemed to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after this idw intellectual dark web</v>

717
00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:05.070
<v Speaker 4>article came out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the big thing that people kept</v>

718
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.140
<v Speaker 4>hitting me on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you don't want any</v>

719
00:29:07.141 --> 00:29:09.090
<v Speaker 4>gatekeeping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll talk to anybody and first off,</v>

720
00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:13.200
<v Speaker 4>I won't talk to anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a general believer that you let</v>

721
00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:16.470
<v Speaker 4>ideas out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what is wrong with talking to people</v>

722
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:18.110
<v Speaker 4>and it's always been what people have</v>
<v Speaker 4>done their,</v>

723
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.640
<v Speaker 4>they've always been interviews with</v>
<v Speaker 4>controversial people.</v>

724
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:22.320
<v Speaker 4>Guess what happens when you stop talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>to people?</v>

725
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:24.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not good.</v>

726
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when shit goes down.</v>

727
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.020
<v Speaker 4>But there's a lot of people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>want us talking to people.</v>

728
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean I look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people were pissed you,</v>

729
00:29:29.691 --> 00:29:31.320
<v Speaker 4>you smoke pot with Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

730
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:32.300
<v Speaker 4>You smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not with Alex.</v>

731
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.930
<v Speaker 4>I watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's bananas.</v>

732
00:29:33.931 --> 00:29:35.910
<v Speaker 4>I watched all the games and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

733
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:40.110
<v Speaker 4>that guy has done some seriously twisted</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy shit.</v>

734
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 4>There is no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Sandy Hook</v>

735
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't know about the sandy hook</v>

736
00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 3>stuff by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before we did the podcast,</v>

737
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:49.780
<v Speaker 3>I knew that he believes a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid conspiracies that are genuinely</v>

738
00:29:49.781 --> 00:29:51.850
<v Speaker 3>just dismissed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know that he was saying</v>

739
00:29:51.851 --> 00:29:56.140
<v Speaker 3>that those kids never died or that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to change the equation for</v>

740
00:29:56.141 --> 00:29:56.331
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

741
00:29:56.331 --> 00:29:58.660
<v Speaker 3>it would have been mad at him and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have talked about it right away.</v>

742
00:29:58.661 --> 00:30:00.460
<v Speaker 3>I would've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

743
00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:02.260
<v Speaker 3>This kids are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a guy that was,</v>

744
00:30:02.261 --> 00:30:04.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a terrible story about a guy who</v>

745
00:30:04.841 --> 00:30:07.860
<v Speaker 3>was a conspiracy theorist before sandy</v>
<v Speaker 3>hook.</v>

746
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.650
<v Speaker 3>Then his kid died at Sandy Hook and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people were threatening him and</v>

747
00:30:11.651 --> 00:30:14.500
<v Speaker 3>calling him a crisis actor and saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>his kid never died.</v>

748
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.050
<v Speaker 3>And then he realized how insane it</v>
<v Speaker 3>really is.</v>

749
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.230
<v Speaker 3>People are looking for conspiracies</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere,</v>

750
00:30:20.231 --> 00:30:20.500
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

751
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 3>I keep hearing them now about Anthony</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bordain that bordain was going to expose</v>

752
00:30:25.091 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Speaker 3>some child pedophile ring and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 3>they suicided him.</v>

753
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:30.280
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

754
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.020
<v Speaker 3>Without going down and fully on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>road.</v>

755
00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:33.970
<v Speaker 3>There is one odd thing about the bordain</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

756
00:30:33.971 --> 00:30:36.580
<v Speaker 3>which is just a few weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't he tweet some odd thing about</v>

<v Speaker 3>machine or something and it's wrong.</v>

759

<v Speaker 3>And he was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you exactly what he was</v>

761
00:30:44.591 --> 00:30:48.430
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same people that Harvey Weinstein</v>

762
00:30:48.431 --> 00:30:51.100
<v Speaker 3>used would that were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] he was basically saying</v>

765
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.250
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

766
00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:06.210
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump's people use the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that Harvey Weinstein used</v>

767
00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Israeli intelligence group too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

768
00:31:11.081 --> 00:31:14.650
<v Speaker 3>there was something that Harvey had done</v>
<v Speaker 3>to his victims where he was trying to</v>

769
00:31:14.651 --> 00:31:17.380
<v Speaker 3>silence them by scaring them with these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

771
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:24.240
<v Speaker 3>Israeli mercenary type folks don't go</v>
<v Speaker 3>down that conspiracy.</v>

772
00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.620
<v Speaker 3>That's not what he was doing with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just saying,</v>

773
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.310
<v Speaker 3>God is just standing there like he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>

774
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:30.130
<v Speaker 3>he had some crazy thing with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend.</v>

775
00:31:30.131 --> 00:31:34.060
<v Speaker 3>We was like fully invested in her battle</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Harvey Weinstein,</v>

776
00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:36.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's what he tweeted about.</v>

777
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.140
<v Speaker 3>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they would kill him for that.</v>

778
00:31:38.141 --> 00:31:39.920
<v Speaker 3>Like that's so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

779
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.850
<v Speaker 3>Well what about Ronan Farrow?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about all the people that wrote the</v>

780
00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:44.770
<v Speaker 3>story?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about all the people that are</v>

781
00:31:44.771 --> 00:31:48.190
<v Speaker 3>accusing him of rape like this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy's going broke.</v>

782
00:31:48.191 --> 00:31:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Two d people don't understand that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvey Weinstein's businesses going</v>

783
00:31:51.191 --> 00:31:52.870
<v Speaker 3>bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucked.</v>

784
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.790
<v Speaker 3>He's going to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

785
00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.410
<v Speaker 3>the walls are caving in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't even have his business</v>

786
00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.160
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran a mercenary to go kill a chef.</v>

787
00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking stupid.</v>

788
00:32:02.051 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 3>This is stupid thinking and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

789
00:32:04.571 --> 00:32:06.730
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that it's impossible for</v>

790
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:08.800
<v Speaker 3>someone who will want to hire someone to</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill someone.</v>

791
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:11.770
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he killed himself.</v>

792
00:32:11.771 --> 00:32:13.570
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible tragedy.</v>

793
00:32:13.571 --> 00:32:18.490
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's really disrespectful to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have all these dumb speculative ideas</v>

794
00:32:18.491 --> 00:32:21.550
<v Speaker 3>because there's sport in conspiracies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a sport.</v>

795
00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:24.220
<v Speaker 3>It's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a hobby that people have.</v>

796
00:32:24.221 --> 00:32:26.410
<v Speaker 3>And looking to fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking for the truth bro.</v>

797
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:30.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at fucking close the gaps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what it is,</v>

798
00:32:30.431 --> 00:32:31.510
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the Illuminati.</v>

799
00:32:31.511 --> 00:32:34.690
<v Speaker 3>The second you think you got it right</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

800
00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:44.810
<v Speaker 3>I've been on the receiving end of her</v>
<v Speaker 3>operatives wrath and it ain't fun.</v>

804
00:32:44.811 --> 00:32:46.030
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's from about a month ago.</v>

805
00:32:46.031 --> 00:32:48.320
<v Speaker 3>Those operatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

806
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.120
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you're going to fill some gaps for</v>

807
00:32:50.121 --> 00:32:52.470
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her operatives wrath.</v>

808
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know,</v>

809
00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:59.620
<v Speaker 3>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is Hillary Clinton was before</v>

810
00:33:00.141 --> 00:33:02.600
<v Speaker 3>the track,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before the scandal happened,</v>

811
00:33:02.601 --> 00:33:05.740
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of photos of Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton hanging out with Weinstein.</v>

812
00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oprah hanging out with them out.</v>

813
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.340
<v Speaker 3>Everybody cuddle and Meryl Streep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meryl Streep,</v>

814
00:33:10.341 --> 00:33:13.880
<v Speaker 3>cuddling up with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the whole thing is there's people</v>

815
00:33:13.881 --> 00:33:16.940
<v Speaker 3>that are complicit for sure in one way</v>
<v Speaker 3>or another.</v>

816
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.540
<v Speaker 3>So after everything you just said and</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing that Joanne's plays that game a</v>

817
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:22.130
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you have him on again?</v>

818
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.170
<v Speaker 3>If I had them on again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be the first thing I would</v>

819
00:33:24.171 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 3>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

820
00:33:25.251 --> 00:33:26.084
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

821
00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:30.560
<v Speaker 3>I've been friends with Alex since 1998</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've known him for a long time.</v>

822
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:34.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's a bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think he's very wrong about a lot</v>

823
00:33:34.131 --> 00:33:36.050
<v Speaker 3>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very misguided about a lot of</v>

824
00:33:36.051 --> 00:33:38.660
<v Speaker 3>things and I think he loves</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies.</v>

825
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.990
<v Speaker 3>There is a bunch of people in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>country that love to make,</v>

826
00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:46.280
<v Speaker 3>they will have to connect the dots and</v>
<v Speaker 3>find conspiracies in fucking everything.</v>

827
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.570
<v Speaker 3>Everything that there is.</v>

828
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:50.060
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes the right and Alex has</v>
<v Speaker 3>been right.</v>

829
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.220
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been right about a bunch of things.</v>

830
00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.540
<v Speaker 3>He was right about the World Trade</v>
<v Speaker 3>Organization particular about when they</v>

831
00:33:56.541 --> 00:34:01.541
<v Speaker 3>were using agent provocateur tours to</v>
<v Speaker 3>disrupt protests and make them violent</v>

832
00:34:02.451 --> 00:34:05.990
<v Speaker 3>protests by smashing windows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he documented all of it and all</v>

833
00:34:05.991 --> 00:34:08.540
<v Speaker 3>these people were um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of them were arrested.</v>

834
00:34:08.541 --> 00:34:12.560
<v Speaker 3>They were all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all went to one safe house and then</v>

835
00:34:12.561 --> 00:34:14.330
<v Speaker 3>negotiated with the police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they were released,</v>

836
00:34:14.331 --> 00:34:15.730
<v Speaker 3>they all had military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

837
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.130
<v Speaker 3>military issue footwear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's got all these,</v>

838
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.760
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these documents from people that worked</v>

839
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:27.530
<v Speaker 3>inside either police or law enforcement</v>
<v Speaker 3>that say that there is a standard</v>

840
00:34:27.531 --> 00:34:31.550
<v Speaker 3>practice and this is existed for a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and when you have peaceful protest</v>

841
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:35.250
<v Speaker 3>and you can't do anything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best way to do something about it is</v>

842
00:34:35.251 --> 00:34:38.240
<v Speaker 3>to take that peaceful protest and turn</v>
<v Speaker 3>it non peaceful.</v>

843
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way you do that,</v>

844
00:34:38.941 --> 00:34:40.910
<v Speaker 3>he have these guys wear masks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go in,</v>

845
00:34:40.911 --> 00:34:42.140
<v Speaker 3>they pretend they're one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>protesters.</v>

846
00:34:42.141 --> 00:34:45.290
<v Speaker 3>They start smashing windows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flipping over cars and then you move the</v>

847
00:34:45.291 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 3>cops and then they shut the protest</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

848
00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:52.340
<v Speaker 3>So you essentially shut the peaceful</v>
<v Speaker 3>protesters down by introducing non</v>

849
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:55.850
<v Speaker 3>peaceful people and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are military operatives,</v>

850
00:34:55.851 --> 00:34:59.060
<v Speaker 3>these are people that are working for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government or working for whoever</v>

851
00:34:59.061 --> 00:35:02.480
<v Speaker 3>the fuck decides to pull the trigger on</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and this is real.</v>

852
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.340
<v Speaker 3>This has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people saying that's</v>

853
00:35:04.341 --> 00:35:07.130
<v Speaker 3>happening with the Tommy Robinson</v>
<v Speaker 3>protests in the UK right now.</v>

854
00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.900
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about that story</v>

855
00:35:08.901 --> 00:35:11.180
<v Speaker 3>other than the fact that a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were mad at me on twitter.</v>

856
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

857
00:35:13.821 --> 00:35:15.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to back away.</v>

858
00:35:15.861 --> 00:35:17.450
<v Speaker 3>And then I saw it was something about he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

859
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:23.200
<v Speaker 3>he was filming outside of a trial of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslim pedophiles.</v>

860
00:35:23.391 --> 00:35:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Is that what these grooming gangs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

861
00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:26.820
<v Speaker 3>grooming gangs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

862
00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:30.260
<v Speaker 3>Tell me the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't want to do this as if I'm the</v>

863
00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:33.440
<v Speaker 3>freaking lawyer of the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in effect he was filming outside of</v>

864
00:35:33.441 --> 00:35:36.830
<v Speaker 3>the trial for these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this group of men that are raping,</v>

865
00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 3>they're to be like</v>

866
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.890
<v Speaker 1>12 and 13 year old girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically they're on trial.</v>

867
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:44.490
<v Speaker 1>He had already been on probation or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something for something else.</v>

868
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:46.850
<v Speaker 1>And you're not allowed to fill them</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the courthouse.</v>

869
00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:50.460
<v Speaker 1>So technically I suppose he is in jail</v>
<v Speaker 1>now for the right reasons,</v>

870
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.160
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of people that think</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to survive being in jail.</v>

871
00:35:53.161 --> 00:35:54.450
<v Speaker 1>And I look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the guy on my show.</v>

872
00:35:54.451 --> 00:35:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever talked to him?</v>

873
00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:57.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know anything about him until</v>

874
00:35:57.631 --> 00:35:58.920
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing happened.</v>

875
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean he has no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

876
00:36:02.071 --> 00:36:03.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all the time,</v>

877
00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:04.280
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

878
00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I know you shit to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have kids.</v>

879
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do occasionally just pick</v>

880
00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:10.490
<v Speaker 1>one and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one dude.</v>

881
00:36:10.491 --> 00:36:12.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>

882
00:36:12.001 --> 00:36:13.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people who will,</v>

883
00:36:13.351 --> 00:36:14.300
<v Speaker 1>how come you're not calm and going?</v>

884
00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.110
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know about it.</v>

885
00:36:16.111 --> 00:36:16.891
<v Speaker 1>You fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

886
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

887
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:20.100
<v Speaker 1>When you sit out something on twitter</v>
<v Speaker 1>for six hours and people started</v>

888
00:36:20.101 --> 00:36:23.250
<v Speaker 1>screaming at you like that proves or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say anything about it.</v>

889
00:36:23.251 --> 00:36:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

890
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.570
<v Speaker 1>you talk all day long about this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

891
00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.260
<v Speaker 1>but then this comes up and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear a word like I didn't even hear</v>

892
00:36:28.261 --> 00:36:29.630
<v Speaker 1>about some just now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

893
00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:31.260
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not dive too deep in that so</v>

894
00:36:31.261 --> 00:36:32.490
<v Speaker 1>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but quick on Jones though.</v>

895
00:36:32.491 --> 00:36:34.800
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not actually in case you think I</v>
<v Speaker 1>am.</v>

896
00:36:34.801 --> 00:36:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not giving you shit for doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just curious.</v>

897
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:41.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm just curious because I think part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the article that that Barry Weiss wrote</v>

898
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:45.150
<v Speaker 1>in the times about us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was talking about that and there's a</v>

899
00:36:45.151 --> 00:36:46.740
<v Speaker 1>line in there where she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

900
00:36:46.741 --> 00:36:50.010
<v Speaker 1>if you talk to these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning Jones in Cernovich and Molyneux,</v>

901
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.280
<v Speaker 1>that you're either cynical or stupid and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in effect that was,</v>

902
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.760
<v Speaker 1>that was a shot at me and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a shot at anybody else because</v>

903
00:36:56.761 --> 00:36:58.500
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to talk to other people.</v>

904
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.510
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I love Eric and Bret Weinstein.</v>

905
00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.880
<v Speaker 1>What she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

906
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.770
<v Speaker 1>we can probably find the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was that you'd have to,</v>

907
00:37:04.771 --> 00:37:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to be cynical or stupid.</v>

908
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

909
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.260
<v Speaker 1>are you against that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't think you have to be,</v>

910
00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:12.570
<v Speaker 1>they're cynical or stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to be a person talking to</v>

911
00:37:12.571 --> 00:37:14.340
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because you're talking to someone</v>

912
00:37:14.341 --> 00:37:15.660
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you agree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

913
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Idea of giving someone a platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm going to have Ted nugent on the</v>

914
00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:19.560
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

915
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.790
<v Speaker 1>You obviously endorse everything he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever since.</v>

916
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:22.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

917
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.250
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

918
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:25.950
<v Speaker 1>that's the only way to look at it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

919
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.260
<v Speaker 1>How come you can't just talk to the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and find out like,</v>

920
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.750
<v Speaker 1>like candace owens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with everything can to so</v>

921
00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.140
<v Speaker 1>and so's.</v>

922
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

923
00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.430
<v Speaker 1>And this is nothing wrong with having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation like that.</v>

924
00:37:35.431 --> 00:37:36.720
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's illuminating.</v>

925
00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:39.510
<v Speaker 1>What do you got here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's find that holding up the line.</v>

926
00:37:39.511 --> 00:37:42.610
<v Speaker 1>This is from the Times piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

927
00:37:42.611 --> 00:37:44.940
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that if you're willing to</v>

928
00:37:44.941 --> 00:37:48.600
<v Speaker 1>sit across from an Alex Jones or Mike</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cernovich and take them seriously,</v>

929
00:37:48.601 --> 00:37:51.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a high probability that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>either cynical or stupid.</v>

930
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a reason for shorting the</v>

931
00:37:53.311 --> 00:37:56.340
<v Speaker 1>idw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the inability of certain members to</v>

932
00:37:56.341 --> 00:37:57.990
<v Speaker 1>see this as a fatal error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

933
00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.490
<v Speaker 1>that's Rogan and Ruben.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

934
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.670
<v Speaker 1>that's what that's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

935
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.870
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just definitely things you can</v>

936
00:38:03.871 --> 00:38:05.400
<v Speaker 1>criticize about me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

937
00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the list,</v>

938
00:38:06.421 --> 00:38:07.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing.</v>

939
00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.470
<v Speaker 1>If you're saying I'm taking him</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

940
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:15.920
<v Speaker 1>I got Alex High and drunk and he started</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about interdimensional,</v>

941
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.450
<v Speaker 1>chogm molesters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if anything,</v>

942
00:38:18.451 --> 00:38:20.220
<v Speaker 1>it showed people who he really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

943
00:38:20.221 --> 00:38:23.250
<v Speaker 1>I've known that guy forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've partied with that dude.</v>

944
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.700
<v Speaker 1>I've had them coming to my comedy shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've gotten fucked up and ran around</v>

945
00:38:26.701 --> 00:38:30.230
<v Speaker 1>the town and went to bars together back</v>
<v Speaker 1>before everybody knew who he was too.</v>

946
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.640
<v Speaker 1>We could go places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fun guy.</v>

947
00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe everything he believes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's silly</v>

948
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.470
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I like a lot of people that I don't</v>

949
00:38:39.471 --> 00:38:41.510
<v Speaker 3>agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to agree with them.</v>

950
00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.970
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know about his Sandy Hook</v>
<v Speaker 3>denial.</v>

951
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.130
<v Speaker 3>If I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would have been the first thing I</v>

952
00:38:46.131 --> 00:38:50.810
<v Speaker 3>pressed him on when I talked to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to do it with my crazy friend</v>

953
00:38:50.811 --> 00:38:54.020
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo cause he believes every</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking conspiracy theory and I wanted</v>

954
00:38:54.021 --> 00:38:57.620
<v Speaker 3>to get him with Alex together and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cluster fuck that I hoped it would</v>

955
00:38:57.621 --> 00:39:00.560
<v Speaker 3>be it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a good thing about it is it</v>

956
00:39:00.561 --> 00:39:04.640
<v Speaker 3>showed people who Alex really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It showed a side of him that you just</v>

957
00:39:04.641 --> 00:39:09.641
<v Speaker 3>don't get from his info wars show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get to see him hi and laughing and</v>

958
00:39:09.681 --> 00:39:12.860
<v Speaker 3>drunk and pounded whiskey and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>around and people are like,</v>

959
00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:16.550
<v Speaker 3>oh I could see why you like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see why he's fun.</v>

960
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:19.940
<v Speaker 3>We had a good time together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean I endorse his opinions</v>

961
00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:22.460
<v Speaker 3>on things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that this is only red or</v>

962
00:39:22.461 --> 00:39:24.380
<v Speaker 3>white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it is one or zero.</v>

963
00:39:24.381 --> 00:39:26.180
<v Speaker 3>It's binary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>

964
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:27.920
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't,</v>

965
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:31.910
<v Speaker 3>those two choices of adjectives I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought were slightly like you could say</v>

966
00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:33.230
<v Speaker 3>defending our position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

967
00:39:33.231 --> 00:39:36.170
<v Speaker 3>I think she's doing a smart thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>because she's a writer for the New York</v>

968
00:39:36.171 --> 00:39:38.960
<v Speaker 3>Times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do have a lot of ridiculous people on</v>

969
00:39:38.961 --> 00:39:40.620
<v Speaker 3>and you have had ridiculous people on</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

970
00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.180
<v Speaker 3>So what she's saying makes sense if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>take them seriously.</v>

971
00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:46.520
<v Speaker 3>But she left that caveat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take them seriously.</v>

972
00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:50.600
<v Speaker 3>I do not take Alex Jones his opinion on</v>
<v Speaker 3>interdimensional child molesters.</v>

973
00:39:50.601 --> 00:39:52.990
<v Speaker 3>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't his opinion,</v>

974
00:39:52.991 --> 00:39:56.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to smoke pot once a year</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to test to see what George Soros</v>

975
00:39:56.511 --> 00:40:00.110
<v Speaker 3>has done with the marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Soros is giving the marijuana</v>

976
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.230
<v Speaker 3>fucking dosage recommendations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's pretty sure.</v>

977
00:40:03.231 --> 00:40:04.940
<v Speaker 3>Roseanne told me that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

978
00:40:04.941 --> 00:40:07.940
<v Speaker 3>she thinks that that's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to do with her now.</v>

979
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.140
<v Speaker 3>She thinks she apologized for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she said George Soros was a Nazi or</v>

980
00:40:12.141 --> 00:40:15.920
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was captured by the Nazis.</v>

981
00:40:15.921 --> 00:40:17.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

982
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:19.521
<v Speaker 2>well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

983
00:40:19.521 --> 00:40:22.160
<v Speaker 2>this gate piracies this gate keeping</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

984
00:40:22.161 --> 00:40:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because if we're going</v>

985
00:40:24.861 --> 00:40:27.830
<v Speaker 2>to do what we do well at whatever level</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do it,</v>

986
00:40:27.831 --> 00:40:30.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like we're going to have to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that people don't like.</v>

987
00:40:30.591 --> 00:40:31.610
<v Speaker 2>And listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

988
00:40:31.611 --> 00:40:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Larry King,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the one thing I always say,</v>

989
00:40:33.171 --> 00:40:34.870
<v Speaker 2>it's like Larry King in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his heyday,</v>

990
00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.920
<v Speaker 2>think of the Prime Larry King,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

991
00:40:36.921 --> 00:40:40.400
<v Speaker 2>So 1991,</v>
<v Speaker 2>CNN prime time,</v>

992
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:42.380
<v Speaker 2>he could have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

993
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Oj Simpson lawyers on,</v>

994
00:40:44.421 --> 00:40:46.760
<v Speaker 2>on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could have the cast show Seinfeld on</v>

995
00:40:46.761 --> 00:40:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could have a magician on Wednesday.</v>

996
00:40:49.641 --> 00:40:52.580
<v Speaker 2>He could have Lucille ball if she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>still alive on Thursday.</v>

997
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:53.900
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

998
00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.940
<v Speaker 2>George,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the secretary of state or something.</v>

999
00:40:55.941 --> 00:40:59.740
<v Speaker 2>So no one thought he endorsed all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those ideas or I was friends with all</v>

1000
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.220
<v Speaker 2>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think somehow now,</v>

1001
00:41:01.221 --> 00:41:04.070
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this feels like your home.</v>

1002
00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Mine is actually in my home the way we</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

1003
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:08.600
<v Speaker 2>We're different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're friendlier.</v>

1004
00:41:08.601 --> 00:41:13.430
<v Speaker 2>We're not sitting here with note cards</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with I fbs and it doesn't feel all</v>

1005
00:41:13.431 --> 00:41:17.580
<v Speaker 2>produced and planned and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though I think we both do a hell of</v>

1006
00:41:17.581 --> 00:41:20.580
<v Speaker 2>a fucking professional show that I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're both really proud of.</v>

1007
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because of that,</v>

1008
00:41:22.801 --> 00:41:23.634
<v Speaker 2>they think,</v>

1009
00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:24.733
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1010
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:27.670
<v Speaker 2>now you're seeing the real them or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1011
00:41:27.671 --> 00:41:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that I'm looking for Shit</v>

1012
00:41:29.441 --> 00:41:30.580
<v Speaker 2>to complain about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1013
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:31.750
<v Speaker 2>I might be the easiest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1014
00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons why I decided to do a</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast in the</v>

1015
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.620
<v Speaker 5>first place cause I wanted to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do whatever I wanted.</v>

1016
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:38.270
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to be able to talk to my</v>
<v Speaker 5>friends,</v>

1017
00:41:38.271 --> 00:41:41.540
<v Speaker 5>have a good time fuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Along the line it became something</v>

1018
00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:44.030
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And along the line it became not just</v>

1019
00:41:44.031 --> 00:41:47.060
<v Speaker 5>talking to my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it became talking to people that are</v>

1020
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:51.230
<v Speaker 5>famous are interesting people or</v>
<v Speaker 5>professors or writers or whoever it is.</v>

1021
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:54.600
<v Speaker 5>And I'm going to do whatever the fuck I</v>
<v Speaker 5>want and that's why I'm doing this.</v>

1022
00:41:54.601 --> 00:41:56.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I want to talk to.</v>

1023
00:41:56.521 --> 00:41:57.960
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't like who I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

1024
00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:01.200
<v Speaker 5>it's super simple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just don't listen to that episode</v>

1025
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:03.570
<v Speaker 5>and go load rogen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're all right now.</v>

1026

<v Speaker 5>All you have is alt right people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think you're balanced up cause you</v>

1027
00:42:06.061 --> 00:42:09.990
<v Speaker 5>have abby Martin on once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I just think I talked to people,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I talked to a lot of people.</v>

<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like talking to people.</v>

1030
00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:17.880
<v Speaker 5>I like talking to people I agree with</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I can usually talk to people.</v>

1031
00:42:17.881 --> 00:42:19.770
<v Speaker 5>I disagree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get something out of that too.</v>

1032
00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

1033
00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:24.760
<v Speaker 2>how aware are you of the thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just said there that like you did</v>

1034
00:42:24.761 --> 00:42:28.000
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you set out to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that you fully set out to</v>

1035
00:42:28.001 --> 00:42:30.490
<v Speaker 2>do it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you did it like this thing that you</v>

1036
00:42:30.491 --> 00:42:33.760
<v Speaker 2>have created is so it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is so what you wanted to do,</v>

1037
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:37.140
<v Speaker 2>whether you fully got it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like you created it,</v>

1038
00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:38.410
<v Speaker 2>it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm,</v>

1039
00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lower level than you are,</v>

1040
00:42:41.141 --> 00:42:45.190
<v Speaker 2>but I'm very aware of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That like I somehow I hated what the</v>

1041
00:42:45.191 --> 00:42:49.180
<v Speaker 2>system was offering and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta do something that feels right</v>

1042
00:42:49.181 --> 00:42:51.570
<v Speaker 2>for me and from a different place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it?</v>

1043
00:42:51.571 --> 00:42:51.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.000
<v Speaker 5>Cause I didn't come at it from a place</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I need a Gig.</v>

1045
00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:56.280
<v Speaker 5>I came at it from a place like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh that'd be fun.</v>

1046
00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.233
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck around.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1048
00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:03.600

<v Speaker 5>I was already the commentator for the</v>

1049
00:43:03.601 --> 00:43:05.820

<v Speaker 5>I mean I did it for years for zero money</v>
<v Speaker 5>for years because I just did it for fun.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like literally for fun dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once a week have fun,</v>

<v Speaker 5>what do you do well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you,</v>

1071
00:44:00.911 --> 00:44:02.410
<v Speaker 5>how are you making your money?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what it,</v>

1072
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:04.480
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is going on in Puerto</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rico?</v>

1073
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:05.350
<v Speaker 5>I this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1074
00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:07.090
<v Speaker 5>I love talking to people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1075
00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.560
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a fascinating thing to just to pick</v>

1076
00:44:10.561 --> 00:44:14.610
<v Speaker 5>the brain uninterrupted with no</v>
<v Speaker 5>distractions,</v>

1077
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.920
<v Speaker 5>to sit down and talk to someone for</v>
<v Speaker 5>hours at a time.</v>

1078
00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.200
<v Speaker 5>You learned a lot about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You learn.</v>

1079
00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.360
<v Speaker 5>Conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm much better,</v>

1080
00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:25.800
<v Speaker 5>much better at talking to people and</v>
<v Speaker 5>being sensitive and open minded and</v>

1081
00:44:25.801 --> 00:44:29.700
<v Speaker 5>being considerate and listening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's a big thing.</v>

1082
00:44:29.701 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 5>Like listening and communicating people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not just waiting</v>

1083
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.590
<v Speaker 2>for my time to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but communicating with people.</v>

1084
00:44:34.591 --> 00:44:37.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like conversation is a lost art</v>

1085
00:44:37.861 --> 00:44:42.861
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of folks and I've gotten way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way better at it over the whatever many</v>

1086
00:44:44.101 --> 00:44:45.180
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine years,</v>

1087
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:47.340
<v Speaker 2>nine years of doing this show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1088
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:48.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1089
00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean I hear you all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1090
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.050
<v Speaker 2>I said at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just am doing what I think is</v>

1091
00:44:52.051 --> 00:44:52.590
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1092
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:56.790
<v Speaker 2>it's fun tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why when I see like the barrage</v>

1093
00:44:56.791 --> 00:44:59.070
<v Speaker 2>of hate that I'll get online for this or</v>
<v Speaker 2>that or just,</v>

1094
00:44:59.071 --> 00:44:59.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>

1095
00:44:59.881 --> 00:45:01.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just these people that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>endless.</v>

1096
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:02.910
<v Speaker 2>You want to hate on everything and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1097
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.170
<v Speaker 2>It's too much noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1098
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.840
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you're spending all day</v>
<v Speaker 2>long hating on me,</v>

1099
00:45:06.841 --> 00:45:09.480
<v Speaker 2>like if anything what I'm doing and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real problem here.</v>

1100
00:45:09.481 --> 00:45:11.370
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like let's say I'm wrong on everything I</v>

1101
00:45:11.371 --> 00:45:12.750
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything I said for the first 10</v>

1102
00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:15.330
<v Speaker 2>minutes about politics is wrong and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>should have strong federal government</v>

1103
00:45:15.331 --> 00:45:17.580
<v Speaker 2>and identity politics like even if that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1104
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:19.650
<v Speaker 2>that's how it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>

1105
00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Am I really the biggest problem here</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are all day long devoting</v>

1106
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:25.260
<v Speaker 2>twitter accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that make accounts all day wrong.</v>

1107
00:45:25.261 --> 00:45:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Dave room and Dave Rubin socks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1108
00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

1109
00:45:28.611 --> 00:45:29.850
<v Speaker 2>Is that going on all the time?</v>

1110
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.800
<v Speaker 2>People get laid anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should know that that's happening.</v>

1111
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:36.190
<v Speaker 2>That's the part of the problem is</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1112
00:45:36.191 --> 00:45:38.610
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of indulging it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but paying attention to it.</v>

1113
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.860
<v Speaker 2>There's just too many people paying way</v>
<v Speaker 2>less attention.</v>

1114
00:45:40.861 --> 00:45:41.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

1115
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't pay attention at all,</v>

1116
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.590
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in a sensory deprivation tank just</v>

1117
00:45:46.591 --> 00:45:47.460
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three days ago.</v>

1118
00:45:47.461 --> 00:45:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Thanks to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing it more.</v>

1119
00:45:49.171 --> 00:45:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I was just in one of these infrared</v>
<v Speaker 2>saunas.</v>

1120
00:45:51.121 --> 00:45:51.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1121
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:54.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing all my August off the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it last August.</v>

1122
00:45:54.511 --> 00:45:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Just literally nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I locked my phone in a safe,</v>

1123
00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.880
<v Speaker 2>really locked my phone in a safe for 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

1124
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Do you call it the TV?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1125
00:46:01.381 --> 00:46:06.280
<v Speaker 2>nothing off the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>August we had some Ruben Ruben esque</v>

1126
00:46:06.281 --> 00:46:08.400
<v Speaker 2>something or other yellow dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that,</v>

1127
00:46:08.401 --> 00:46:09.570
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to do it for now on.</v>

1128
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing that every August.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1129
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am completely shutting down.</v>

1130
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on this book that I started</v>

1131
00:46:15.421 --> 00:46:17.850
<v Speaker 2>last August and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then of course the year gets so</v>

1132
00:46:17.851 --> 00:46:19.620
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have to pick it up again in</v>

1133
00:46:19.621 --> 00:46:20.880
<v Speaker 2>August.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been writing it now while I'm on</v>

1134
00:46:20.881 --> 00:46:21.990
<v Speaker 2>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the book about?</v>

1135
00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go too far in it,</v>

1136
00:46:24.391 --> 00:46:26.670
<v Speaker 2>but it in effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's when I did that prager u video</v>

1137
00:46:26.671 --> 00:46:29.490
<v Speaker 2>about why I left the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of the genesis of it,</v>

1138
00:46:29.491 --> 00:46:31.680
<v Speaker 2>of sort of giving people a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a roadmap.</v>

1139
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:33.680
<v Speaker 2>What does the prager u video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aware of it.</v>

1140
00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.160
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're familiar with pay for you,</v>

1141
00:46:35.161 --> 00:46:36.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Dennis Prager,</v>

1142
00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:38.510
<v Speaker 2>super conservative fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1143
00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:42.000
<v Speaker 2>So he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has this online university where they</v>

1144
00:46:42.001 --> 00:46:45.840
<v Speaker 2>do these five minute cartoon videos on</v>
<v Speaker 2>different ideas and they'll do on</v>

1145
00:46:45.841 --> 00:46:48.780
<v Speaker 2>economics and foreign policy and race</v>
<v Speaker 2>and religion,</v>

1146
00:46:48.781 --> 00:46:49.411
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

1147
00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:50.244
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

1148
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.820
<v Speaker 2>And so I did one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a bout a year and a half ago,</v>

1149
00:46:53.821 --> 00:46:56.100
<v Speaker 2>February of last year called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1150
00:46:56.101 --> 00:46:58.470
<v Speaker 2>I had actually never said the phrase why</v>
<v Speaker 2>I left the left,</v>

1151
00:46:58.471 --> 00:47:01.860
<v Speaker 2>but I just talked about my frustrations</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the left and why I believe in</v>

1152
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:06.861
<v Speaker 2>freedom and in liberty they titled It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why I left the left and it's chilly.</v>

1153
00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:09.840
<v Speaker 2>The first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first half hour when it dropped,</v>

1154
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.750
<v Speaker 2>I was pissed because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1155
00:47:12.751 --> 00:47:16.530
<v Speaker 2>did they just like blow my gig?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I really felt at that time,</v>

1156
00:47:16.531 --> 00:47:20.220
<v Speaker 2>I feel a little differently now that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was trying to fix the left from within</v>

1157
00:47:20.221 --> 00:47:23.580
<v Speaker 2>or at least have conversations as</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that was one of these people.</v>

1158
00:47:23.581 --> 00:47:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Like that's why I was focusing on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

1159
00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.750
<v Speaker 2>The all these liberals were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were my people.</v>

1160
00:47:27.751 --> 00:47:29.950
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing that I grew up in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always believed in.</v>

1161
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.200
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that they did that first</v>
<v Speaker 2>half hour,</v>

1162
00:47:32.201 --> 00:47:33.070
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1163
00:47:33.071 --> 00:47:35.320
<v Speaker 2>like did I just get booted out?</v>

1164
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.540
<v Speaker 2>And then quickly I realized that video</v>
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>

1165
00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:40.000
<v Speaker 2>went so viral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's their number one viewed video on</v>

1166
00:47:40.001 --> 00:47:42.130
<v Speaker 2>youtube that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1167
00:47:42.131 --> 00:47:44.450
<v Speaker 2>I have to just kind of embrace this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1168
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.880
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to the labels thing.</v>

1169
00:47:45.881 --> 00:47:48.590
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really matter whether you</v>
<v Speaker 2>left the three,</v>

1170
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.190
<v Speaker 2>whether you're a libertarian or</v>
<v Speaker 2>classical liberal of the rest of it.</v>

1171
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:53.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

1172
00:47:53.231 --> 00:47:57.010
<v Speaker 2>that's the genesis of the book of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>just how do you escape this sort of</v>

1173
00:47:57.011 --> 00:48:02.011
<v Speaker 2>monolithic totalitarian thinking and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you just be whoever you are and how</v>

1174
00:48:03.191 --> 00:48:05.860
<v Speaker 2>does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does being an individual basically</v>

1175
00:48:05.861 --> 00:48:08.680
<v Speaker 2>lead you to being happy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think that's actually the only</v>

1176
00:48:08.681 --> 00:48:11.200
<v Speaker 2>way that you can be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's it.</v>

1177
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.230
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1178
00:48:12.231 --> 00:48:15.250
<v Speaker 2>it's the most cliche thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what Peterson's telling these</v>

1179
00:48:15.251 --> 00:48:18.070
<v Speaker 2>people every night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thousands and thousands and</v>

1180
00:48:18.071 --> 00:48:21.790
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people are showing up every</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and he talks about the individual,</v>

1181
00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:23.950
<v Speaker 2>he talks about stand up straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1182
00:48:23.951 --> 00:48:24.790
<v Speaker 2>clean your room.</v>

1183
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Like these things all sound silly at</v>
<v Speaker 2>some level and the more that I'm with</v>

1184
00:48:29.171 --> 00:48:32.230
<v Speaker 2>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like he's giving these people</v>

1185
00:48:32.231 --> 00:48:35.170
<v Speaker 2>saying that has just been so lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like so.</v>

1186
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People think you can just be pathetic.</v>

1187
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Blame the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything else.</v>

1188
00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:42.790
<v Speaker 2>It's somebody else's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be given shit.</v>

1189
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.510
<v Speaker 2>All of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like ethic about every movie,</v>

1190
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:48.820
<v Speaker 2>any movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever your 10 favorite movies are.</v>

1191
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.590
<v Speaker 2>Is it about a guy who just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1192
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.220
<v Speaker 2>the world sucks and what the fuck am I</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do on somebody?</v>

1193
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:54.670
<v Speaker 2>It's somebody else's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1194
00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.010
<v Speaker 2>every great movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1195
00:48:57.030 --> 00:49:01.240
<v Speaker 2>You guys got a problem and guess what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>does solves the problem and that's what</v>

1196
00:49:01.241 --> 00:49:02.890
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is an adventure.</v>

1197
00:49:02.891 --> 00:49:03.880
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this life.</v>

1198
00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.480
<v Speaker 2>But when you mean the individual like</v>
<v Speaker 2>being an individual is the only way to</v>

1199
00:49:07.481 --> 00:49:08.860
<v Speaker 2>be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by that?</v>

1200
00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:10.001
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1201
00:49:10.001 --> 00:49:12.700
<v Speaker 2>first off that we should only be judged</v>
<v Speaker 2>as individuals.</v>

1202
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:14.680
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So remove all the immutable</v>

1203
00:49:14.681 --> 00:49:15.940
<v Speaker 2>characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gay,</v>

1204
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:16.631
<v Speaker 2>big dam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1205
00:49:16.631 --> 00:49:19.180
<v Speaker 2>But you got any specific questions for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me on that big dam?</v>

1206
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:20.023
<v Speaker 2>Whoop.</v>

1207
00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.200
<v Speaker 2>I was that big dam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1208
00:49:23.201 --> 00:49:24.910
<v Speaker 2>But like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1209
00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:30.480
<v Speaker 2>just saying that means nothing other</v>
<v Speaker 2>than you can figure out who I sleep</v>

1210
00:49:30.941 --> 00:49:31.330
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1211
00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:32.163
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1212
00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:35.560
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All we can do is judge people as</v>

1213
00:49:35.561 --> 00:49:39.070
<v Speaker 2>individuals and you have to just figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out what is right for you.</v>

1214
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.950
<v Speaker 2>So for all the people that I disagree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that are sort of like big</v>

1215
00:49:41.951 --> 00:49:44.170
<v Speaker 2>government lefties and blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I get why that unique,</v>

1216
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.600
<v Speaker 2>maybe need a little more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you live in a big city where you</v>

1217
00:49:46.601 --> 00:49:49.450
<v Speaker 2>might need more noise regulations than</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lived in the freaking,</v>

1218
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:51.760
<v Speaker 2>if you live in the middle of Idaho on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>farm or whatever,</v>

1219
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.920
<v Speaker 2>it's like if that's the life that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to live,</v>

1220
00:49:53.921 --> 00:49:56.710
<v Speaker 2>then fight for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what we're doing now is this</v>

1221
00:49:56.711 --> 00:50:00.910
<v Speaker 2>collective is craziness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is causing people to be unable to think</v>

1222
00:50:00.911 --> 00:50:01.390
<v Speaker 2>clearly.</v>

1223
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:05.350
<v Speaker 2>So like Huffington post yesterday wrote</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thing about how you have to choose</v>

1224
00:50:05.351 --> 00:50:09.220
<v Speaker 2>between being for gay people are I said</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was for queer people or for</v>

1225
00:50:09.221 --> 00:50:12.130
<v Speaker 2>chick filet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I happened to be the peers because</v>

1226
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 2>of Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause Jack got in trouble or he's tweet</v>

1227
00:50:15.611 --> 00:50:18.400
<v Speaker 2>about chick filet and it was like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a tweet about chick filet.</v>

1228
00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:18.911
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1229
00:50:18.911 --> 00:50:21.760
<v Speaker 2>cause he tweeted that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he showed like a digital receipt that he</v>

1230
00:50:21.761 --> 00:50:24.160
<v Speaker 2>bought chick filet and then solar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That O'brian was like,</v>

1231
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:27.950
<v Speaker 2>you tweeted that on gay pride month and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like endless.</v>

1232
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.950
<v Speaker 1>But why would he tweet of a chick filet</v>
<v Speaker 1>receipt?</v>

1233
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy likes chicken fillet.</v>

1234
00:50:33.321 --> 00:50:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not allowed to like it.</v>

1235
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better not like chick fil a chick</v>

1236
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.420
<v Speaker 1>fil A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a picture yesterday,</v>

1237
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:44.220
<v Speaker 1>there was a chick filet next door to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1238
00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.490
<v Speaker 1>to the theater we were at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a picture of chick ballet there</v>

1239
00:50:46.491 --> 00:50:48.620
<v Speaker 1>and I tweeted out the thing and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1240
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.890
<v Speaker 1>I like chicken sandwiches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I've gone into a chick fil a</v>

1241
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:54.830
<v Speaker 1>that people are going to find me one</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast food restaurant.</v>

1242
00:50:54.831 --> 00:50:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Is that so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what he did.</v>

1243
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the cash app.</v>

1244
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:02.290
<v Speaker 1>That's one of our sponsors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're 10% boosted.</v>

1245
00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Chick-Filet was applied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were charged 28 43 chick-filet ah,</v>

1246
00:51:08.301 --> 00:51:13.301
<v Speaker 1>he dared and leave 10% on gay pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote boost and then he tagged</v>

1247
00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.090
<v Speaker 1>chick-filet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1248
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:18.440
<v Speaker 1>And Soledad O'brien showed who's I</v>
<v Speaker 1>showed him who his loss.</v>

1249
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:22.940
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that sort of this endless guilting</v>

1250
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:25.550
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know you do this,</v>

1251
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:29.960
<v Speaker 1>so your eval it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ruining the fabric of society.</v>

1252
00:51:29.961 --> 00:51:31.700
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eat Chicken.</v>

1253
00:51:31.701 --> 00:51:34.040
<v Speaker 1>If you like chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't eat it if you don't like it.</v>

1254
00:51:34.041 --> 00:51:36.890
<v Speaker 1>But that's what individualism is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to make the choice,</v>

1255
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.650
<v Speaker 1>if you think that whatever chick-filet</v>
<v Speaker 1>is doing to gay people,</v>

1256
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.250
<v Speaker 1>whatever they're secretly doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gave live.</v>

1257
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:42.410
<v Speaker 1>You think that's so evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though,</v>

1258
00:51:42.411 --> 00:51:44.690
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the pulse nightclub shooting at</v>

1259
00:51:44.691 --> 00:51:47.510
<v Speaker 1>the gay club in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when 51 people were killed,</v>

1260
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:51.260
<v Speaker 1>they gave free food to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you think they hate gay people</v>

1261
00:51:51.261 --> 00:51:53.000
<v Speaker 1>that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then don't shop there.</v>

1262
00:51:53.001 --> 00:51:57.230
<v Speaker 1>But you don't have to harangue everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else into doing everything that you want</v>

1263
00:51:57.231 --> 00:51:59.780
<v Speaker 1>them to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually the reverse of freedom,</v>

1264
00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:01.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live and let live that.</v>

1265
00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:05.900
<v Speaker 1>That's why I believe I could see people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're saying that chick filet is a</v>

1266
00:52:05.901 --> 00:52:08.900
<v Speaker 1>homophobic institution that that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't endorse.</v>

1267
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Chick-Filet is particularly if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay man,</v>

1268
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.840
<v Speaker 1>but what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go into chip Jay,</v>

1269
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:16.790
<v Speaker 1>not that I know of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1270
00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.760
<v Speaker 1>so it's not that that seemed weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to,</v>

1271
00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:24.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he clearly is an influencer and I</v>

1272
00:52:25.281 --> 00:52:28.680
<v Speaker 1>think that the cash app,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had to gas,</v>

1273
00:52:28.681 --> 00:52:31.490
<v Speaker 1>because they sponsored this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very active in sponsoring</v>

1274
00:52:31.491 --> 00:52:34.550
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably have some sort of an</v>

1275
00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:37.340
<v Speaker 1>endorsement deal with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why he did that.</v>

1276
00:52:37.341 --> 00:52:39.920
<v Speaker 1>So it was a financial thing for the cash</v>
<v Speaker 1>app,</v>

1277
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:42.170
<v Speaker 1>if I want to guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1278
00:52:42.171 --> 00:52:43.610
<v Speaker 1>so we don't know about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>

1279
00:52:43.611 --> 00:52:45.860
<v Speaker 1>but if they were paying him to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's for him.</v>

1280
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:48.170
<v Speaker 1>That's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for him as an individual to</v>

1281
00:52:48.171 --> 00:52:50.600
<v Speaker 1>decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am going to say pride month is this</v>

1282
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.280
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this month,</v>

1283
00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.930
<v Speaker 1>this is the gay as month there is dam</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm here with you.</v>

1284
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the gay as they come into all of</v>

1285
00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.190
<v Speaker 1>June.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1286
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>June.</v>

1287
00:52:58.791 --> 00:53:01.400
<v Speaker 1>It's very gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I'm saying like how many</v>

1288
00:53:01.401 --> 00:53:03.500
<v Speaker 1>people were upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many pieces but,</v>

1289
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:06.110
<v Speaker 1>but it goes exactly to where we started</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this whole thing.</v>

1290
00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:10.340
<v Speaker 1>There is this loud group of people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them have some sort of odd</v>

1291
00:53:10.341 --> 00:53:12.830
<v Speaker 1>influencing media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all of these blue check,</v>

1292
00:53:12.831 --> 00:53:15.610
<v Speaker 1>buzzfeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>4,000 twitter follower people then</v>

1293
00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:19.040
<v Speaker 1>retweet all of the articles of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like them at Salon in box and</v>

1294
00:53:19.041 --> 00:53:22.040
<v Speaker 1>buzzfeed and then in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they make it seem like we're all</v>

1295
00:53:22.041 --> 00:53:23.540
<v Speaker 1>hysterical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy people.</v>

1296
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 1>And I simply don't believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that most</v>

1297
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.230
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say the vast majority of people</v>

1298
00:53:28.231 --> 00:53:30.900
<v Speaker 3>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think it's something crazy like</v>

1299
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 3>80% of people I think are good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decent people who just want people to</v>

1300
00:53:34.471 --> 00:53:35.520
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want,</v>

1301
00:53:35.521 --> 00:53:38.130
<v Speaker 3>you can fuck who you want to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can smoke what you want to smoke.</v>

1302
00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:40.710
<v Speaker 3>You can't do it on my property.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't take what's mine.</v>

1303
00:53:40.711 --> 00:53:45.090
<v Speaker 3>You can't force me to bake a cake or do</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of those things.</v>

1304
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:48.150
<v Speaker 3>But you can allow people to live as they</v>
<v Speaker 3>see fit.</v>

1305
00:53:48.151 --> 00:53:51.150
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what most people are and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why there's such a push back.</v>

1306
00:53:51.151 --> 00:53:54.030
<v Speaker 3>That's the answer to the Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peterson said,</v>

1307
00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:57.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to use pronouns that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government forces me to use.</v>

1308
00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:58.830
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what put him on the,</v>

1309
00:53:58.831 --> 00:54:01.590
<v Speaker 3>that it's all sold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's so many of them.</v>

1310
00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:03.310
<v Speaker 3>They got so silly with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it,</v>

1311
00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.550
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made sense that someone was pushing</v>

1312
00:54:05.551 --> 00:54:08.080
<v Speaker 3>back to 78 different gender pronouns.</v>

1313
00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:10.530
<v Speaker 3>And you're obviously dealing with people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are being silly.</v>

1314
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:13.580
<v Speaker 3>This is not like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just people being silly.</v>

1315
00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:17.130
<v Speaker 3>You remember when ms came along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was miss and there was messages</v>

1316
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:19.080
<v Speaker 3>and when was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What year was that?</v>

1317
00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:21.660
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember being super confused.</v>

1318
00:54:21.661 --> 00:54:22.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dammit,</v>

1319
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:23.580
<v Speaker 3>a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1320
00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.680
<v Speaker 3>what's the matter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the CEO of that company too.</v>

1321
00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.250
<v Speaker 3>Who Is Jack?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1322
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:28.181
<v Speaker 3>Of Cash App.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1323
00:54:28.181 --> 00:54:31.720
<v Speaker 3>he's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>advertising has company.</v>

1324
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:34.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that makes total sense.</v>

1325
00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:35.880
<v Speaker 3>Makes total sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1326
00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.090
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1327
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:39.120
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1328
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:42.480
<v Speaker 3>I just think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's a tricky one.</v>

1329
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:43.980
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's different.</v>

1330
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:46.800
<v Speaker 3>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a guy promoting something on one of</v>

1331
00:54:46.801 --> 00:54:51.120
<v Speaker 3>the things that he owns and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's doing it on gay pride month.</v>

1332
00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:53.370
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1333
00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:58.230
<v Speaker 3>really like it just so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what is it that they,</v>

1334
00:54:58.231 --> 00:55:00.960
<v Speaker 3>so I guess at one point they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>against gay marriage and maybe they</v>

1335
00:55:00.961 --> 00:55:01.650
<v Speaker 3>still are now.</v>

1336
00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:04.560
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what every cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of all of us not to late CEO.</v>

1337
00:55:04.561 --> 00:55:07.760
<v Speaker 3>Isn't the CEO dead?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the CEO that was like super,</v>

1338
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.890
<v Speaker 3>I think it is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the original guy in his honor.</v>

1339
00:55:10.891 --> 00:55:13.470
<v Speaker 3>His wishes though and keep it close on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunday still.</v>

1340
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.600
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time I do,</v>

1341
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:16.080

<v Speaker 3>cause I want a chicken sandwich on</v>

<v Speaker 3>Somebody should be opening the Sunday</v>

1344
00:55:22.141 --> 00:55:23.970
<v Speaker 3>chicken sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not In pro gay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's all so stupid.</v>

1347
00:55:28.711 --> 00:55:30.540
<v Speaker 3>Eat a sandwich if you want a sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

1348
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:33.260
<v Speaker 3>every time I've gotten into chick ballet</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you've got it play,</v>

1349
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:35.220

<v Speaker 3>Not just when been there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Literally twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And are they nice?</v>

1351
00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're nobody.</v>

1352
00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:40.020
<v Speaker 3>They're friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're friendly.</v>

1353
00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:41.720
<v Speaker 3>They don't look yelled at me for things.</v>

1354
00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:42.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1355
00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:44.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know ma'am.</v>

1356
00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:46.640
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1357
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:50.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's that much outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a business in outrage</v>

1358
00:55:50.431 --> 00:55:51.930
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's certainly a business in a</v>

1359
00:55:51.931 --> 00:55:55.950
<v Speaker 3>lot of people that write these articles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Jordan Peterson thing has been</v>

1360
00:55:55.951 --> 00:55:59.280
<v Speaker 3>very illuminating to me because I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>watched them misrepresent his positions</v>

1361
00:55:59.281 --> 00:56:02.940
<v Speaker 3>on so many different things and call him</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many horrible names,</v>

1362
00:56:02.941 --> 00:56:04.350
<v Speaker 3>transphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>

1363
00:56:04.351 --> 00:56:06.400
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these different things and,</v>

1364
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:07.980
<v Speaker 3>and do so with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1365
00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:11.370
<v Speaker 3>with no justification or</v>
<v Speaker 3>rationalization.</v>

1366
00:56:11.371 --> 00:56:13.560
<v Speaker 3>Like you look at the actual article and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

1367
00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:16.110
<v Speaker 3>they don't post to what he actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>

1368
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:17.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like that woman in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1369
00:56:17.701 --> 00:56:20.040
<v Speaker 3>the munk debates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was it called?</v>

1370
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was it called?</v>

1371
00:56:21.181 --> 00:56:21.770
<v Speaker 3>The monk debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1372
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1373
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 3>whoever that woman was</v>

1374
00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Goldberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think whatever.</v>

1375
00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was her and Eric a dyson.</v>

1376
00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When she said,</v>

1377
00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't want her to,</v>

1378
00:56:32.051 --> 00:56:34.690
<v Speaker 1>where he doesn't think she should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to wear makeup at work.</v>

1379
00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:35.730
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never said that.</v>

1380
00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can google it.</v>

1381
00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.013
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can.</v>

1382
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:40.120
<v Speaker 1>We can google it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can find out.</v>

1383
00:56:40.121 --> 00:56:42.220
<v Speaker 1>You made me Google something that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were wrong about.</v>

1384
00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.780
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's upsetting to me.</v>

1385
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1386
00:56:45.941 --> 00:56:49.000
<v Speaker 1>that bothers me more than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is dishonest.</v>

1387
00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:51.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a hundred percent dishonest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knew.</v>

1388
00:56:51.191 --> 00:56:56.191
<v Speaker 1>He did not say that if they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was having an intellectual exercise</v>

1389
00:56:56.621 --> 00:56:59.290
<v Speaker 1>with an interviewer and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things that's gotten</v>

1390
00:56:59.291 --> 00:57:03.850
<v Speaker 1>him into trouble is his openness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss things with question mark.</v>

1391
00:57:03.851 --> 00:57:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Just bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't question marks.</v>

1392
00:57:05.501 --> 00:57:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we can work together.</v>

1393
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:10.300
<v Speaker 1>We've only been doing it for 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1394
00:57:10.301 --> 00:57:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Why do women wear makeup in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>workplace?</v>

1395
00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Why do women wear short skirts and high</v>
<v Speaker 1>heels?</v>

1396
00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Why do they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's saying you can't do</v>

1397
00:57:18.191 --> 00:57:19.540
<v Speaker 1>that or you shouldn't be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1398
00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:22.390
<v Speaker 1>He's saying why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying that there's obvious</v>

1399
00:57:22.391 --> 00:57:25.780
<v Speaker 1>realities and when you turn on CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it that Jake Tapper,</v>

1400
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Cooper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wolf Blitzer and the rest of the men are</v>

1401
00:57:28.271 --> 00:57:30.400
<v Speaker 1>all in suits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They dress exactly the same.</v>

1402
00:57:30.401 --> 00:57:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Andersons are a little more tailored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody just say,</v>

1403
00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.550
<v Speaker 1>what are the women all wear every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman dresses.</v>

1404
00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:38.620
<v Speaker 1>They all wear dresses with cutoff</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeves.</v>

1405
00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:42.180
<v Speaker 1>That right there all sprayed 10 they all</v>
<v Speaker 1>have gorgeous hair,</v>

1406
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:42.851
<v Speaker 1>lipstick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1407
00:57:42.851 --> 00:57:43.684
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

1408
00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Why is it Wolf Blitzer walking in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

1409
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:49.060
<v Speaker 1>which we're going to have to cut off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would look like Netflix special.</v>

1410
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:52.930
<v Speaker 1>I have a whole bit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About women on Fox News versus men on</v>

1411
00:57:52.931 --> 00:57:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Fox who's watching it with the sound off</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking pot.</v>

1412
00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of a wild life show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something very strange.</v>

1413
00:57:59.621 --> 00:58:01.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird cultural dance that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

1414
00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:04.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that Jordan's talking about</v>

1415
00:58:04.331 --> 00:58:06.310
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that men and women dressed differently,</v>

1416
00:58:06.311 --> 00:58:10.630
<v Speaker 1>women put on lipstick to look tracted</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you work out Joe Rogan?</v>

1417
00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I don't tell people I don't want</v>

1418
00:58:13.601 --> 00:58:15.350
<v Speaker 1>to buy now be angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So number one,</v>

1419
00:58:15.351 --> 00:58:16.690
<v Speaker 1>so you don't kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But number two,</v>

1420
00:58:16.691 --> 00:58:18.340
<v Speaker 1>you want to look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to feel good,</v>

1421
00:58:18.341 --> 00:58:22.000
<v Speaker 1>you want to be in a body that you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look good for your wife and blah,</v>

1422
00:58:22.001 --> 00:58:22.271
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

1423
00:58:22.271 --> 00:58:26.800
<v Speaker 1>And you want to live long like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deny these realities all the time and</v>

1424
00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:29.830
<v Speaker 1>to think that that's because of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>toxic masculinity and all of this</v>

1425
00:58:29.831 --> 00:58:30.250
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

1426
00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I agree that it is a loud minority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I,</v>

1427
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.640
<v Speaker 1>what I think maybe where we're having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little difference is that I think this</v>

1428
00:58:36.641 --> 00:58:40.780
<v Speaker 1>thing has spread in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is so easy to believe this nonsense,</v>

1429
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:45.990
<v Speaker 1>this abject drivel that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is infecting young people at an</v>

1430
00:58:46.151 --> 00:58:47.500
<v Speaker 1>alarming rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the way,</v>

1431
00:58:47.501 --> 00:58:49.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of hopeful signs on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause now they're doing all these</v>

1432
00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:52.420
<v Speaker 1>studies that the generation right after</v>
<v Speaker 1>millennials.</v>

1433
00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:55.620
<v Speaker 1>So the kids that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like 15 now that they're</v>

1434
00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:59.680
<v Speaker 1>actually more conservative now because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they see all this as absolute hysteria.</v>

1435
00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:02.110
<v Speaker 1>So I think there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are getting like a little bit of a</v>

1436
00:59:02.111 --> 00:59:06.160
<v Speaker 1>rubber band effect on this thing and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think things are shifting into normalcy</v>

1437
00:59:06.161 --> 00:59:09.840
<v Speaker 1>and that's why people are listening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your show and listening to Sam's podcast</v>

1438
00:59:09.841 --> 00:59:12.490
<v Speaker 1>and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's an issue with people</v>

1439
00:59:12.491 --> 00:59:17.491
<v Speaker 1>commenting on things that other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying and just sort of jumping in</v>

1440
00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 1>and not having the other person there to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss these subjects</v>

1441
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:25.100
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Particularly like why do women wear</v>

1442
00:59:25.101 --> 00:59:28.430
<v Speaker 3>makeup at work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do women dress the way they dress?</v>

1443
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:31.970
<v Speaker 3>I think if you sat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were sitting down with Jordan</v>

1444
00:59:31.971 --> 00:59:35.210
<v Speaker 3>talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's willing to engage in these subjects</v>

1445
00:59:35.211 --> 00:59:38.210
<v Speaker 3>with a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very broad canvas.</v>

1446
00:59:38.211 --> 00:59:40.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's willing to look at all the various</v>

1447
00:59:40.551 --> 00:59:44.120
<v Speaker 3>aspects of them because as a legitimate</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual,</v>

1448
00:59:44.121 --> 00:59:46.940
<v Speaker 3>that's what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an intellectual exercise in</v>

1449
00:59:46.941 --> 00:59:51.740
<v Speaker 3>discussion of cultural norms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why do women wear the shoes where</v>

1450
00:59:51.741 --> 00:59:54.920
<v Speaker 3>you can see their toes in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the workplace.</v>

1451
00:59:54.921 --> 00:59:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if a guy showed up with flip</v>
<v Speaker 3>flops on,</v>

1452
00:59:56.811 --> 00:59:57.644
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>

1453
00:59:57.650 --> 01:00:00.530
<v Speaker 3>the fuck we're at work here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get outta here with this bullshit</v>

1454
01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.310
<v Speaker 3>outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1455
01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:04.100
<v Speaker 3>go put on some goddamn dress shoes were</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the office.</v>

1456
01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:06.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is strange that women were very</v>

1457
01:00:06.831 --> 01:00:09.950
<v Speaker 3>little close in comparison to the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>men do on these shows.</v>

1458
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:12.710
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think there's anything wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the discussion.</v>

1459
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:17.630
<v Speaker 3>The problem is framing it as if he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying you shouldn't be able to,</v>

1460
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.421
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1461
01:00:18.421 --> 01:00:22.010
<v Speaker 3>if someone got on TV and said you</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be able to wear makeup at</v>

1462
01:00:22.011 --> 01:00:23.780
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be able to dress like</v>

1463
01:00:23.781 --> 01:00:25.550
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a problem.</v>

1464
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.590
<v Speaker 3>So think about what these guys are doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>in effect.</v>

1465
01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:27.981
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1466
01:00:27.981 --> 01:00:30.770
<v Speaker 3>so you're saying that Jordan's taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically a,</v>

1467
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:35.420
<v Speaker 3>a decent but potentially confusing</v>
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>

1468
01:00:35.421 --> 01:00:37.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's basically a right decision of</v>

1469
01:00:37.281 --> 01:00:40.190
<v Speaker 3>let's have a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they write all these hippies and</v>

1470
01:00:40.191 --> 01:00:41.930
<v Speaker 3>why do they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they can't get any,</v>

1471
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just did release this study about</v>

1472
01:00:43.851 --> 01:00:46.820
<v Speaker 3>journalists and they're basically all</v>
<v Speaker 3>paid like 45 grand a year and they're</v>

1473
01:00:46.821 --> 01:00:47.810
<v Speaker 3>alcoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1474
01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:50.660
<v Speaker 3>just broadly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they just want all these clicks.</v>

1475
01:00:50.661 --> 01:00:53.840
<v Speaker 3>They want their jobs and they realize</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these websites that are faking as</v>

1476
01:00:53.841 --> 01:00:55.050
<v Speaker 3>journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1477
01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.950
<v Speaker 3>faking as places of journalism that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just trying to hold onto their</v>

1478
01:00:57.951 --> 01:00:58.970
<v Speaker 3>jobs as long as they can.</v>

1479
01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:01.850
<v Speaker 3>But if you're one of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's a great way to keep your job?</v>

1480
01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy out here who sold over a</v>

1481
01:01:04.341 --> 01:01:07.820
<v Speaker 3>million copies of his book who's on tour</v>
<v Speaker 3>selling out beacon theater and blah,</v>

1482
01:01:07.821 --> 01:01:09.140
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah all over the world.</v>

1483
01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to write a hit piece on him</v>
<v Speaker 3>because guess what?</v>

1484
01:01:11.271 --> 01:01:14.120
<v Speaker 3>That's going to drive a hell of a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>more traffic than writing something,</v>

1485
01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.150
<v Speaker 3>something honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's part of the game.</v>

1486
01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:18.253
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1487
01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:20.450
<v Speaker 3>I've discussed this many times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including onstage with him.</v>

1488
01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.910
<v Speaker 3>Why does he keep retweeting the</v>
<v Speaker 3>articles?</v>

1489
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:26.210
<v Speaker 3>His belief is while I'm still here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still here.</v>

1490
01:01:26.211 --> 01:01:28.890
<v Speaker 3>I have exposed them and I'm still here</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if anything,</v>

1491
01:01:28.891 --> 01:01:31.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm bigger because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now one of them was a guy who was</v>

1492
01:01:31.281 --> 01:01:32.370
<v Speaker 3>his friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1493
01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:36.320
<v Speaker 3>I know he's pissed about that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a weird one because the guy's</v>

1494
01:01:36.321 --> 01:01:37.430
<v Speaker 3>argument was shit.</v>

1495
01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.870
<v Speaker 3>It was like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

1496
01:01:38.871 --> 01:01:40.820
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Jordan Peterson is dangerous.</v>

1497
01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.090
<v Speaker 3>Like dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't explain dude,</v>

1498
01:01:44.091 --> 01:01:46.280
<v Speaker 3>why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that is I don't give</v>

1499
01:01:46.281 --> 01:01:49.190
<v Speaker 3>you many chances like that if you write</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

1500
01:01:49.191 --> 01:01:51.470
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to discredit your</v>

1501
01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:52.940
<v Speaker 3>opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to think about,</v>

1502
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

1503
01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.960
<v Speaker 3>let me listen to this intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 3>person's perspective.</v>

1504
01:01:56.961 --> 01:01:57.651
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1505
01:01:57.651 --> 01:02:01.130
<v Speaker 3>this is that silly fuck that dumb idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Jordan Peterson.</v>

1506
01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:04.640
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a some sort of a rationalization</v>

1507
01:02:04.641 --> 01:02:07.130
<v Speaker 3>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting attention to virtue,</v>

1508
01:02:07.131 --> 01:02:09.770
<v Speaker 3>signal over what Peterson is saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it didn't,</v>

1509
01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:12.140
<v Speaker 3>he didn't have any real points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't make any sense.</v>

1510
01:02:12.141 --> 01:02:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I actually read that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that full one,</v>

1511
01:02:14.421 --> 01:02:18.380
<v Speaker 3>but I know that I tried to go back over</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and see if I'm,</v>

1512
01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 3>if it made any sense to me and nothing.</v>

1513
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:22.440
<v Speaker 5>You got nothing that he just didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>represent.</v>

1514
01:02:22.441 --> 01:02:24.570
<v Speaker 5>His opinions are accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem.</v>

1515
01:02:24.571 --> 01:02:28.500
<v Speaker 5>When people don't represent the opinions</v>
<v Speaker 5>accurately set up a straw man and then</v>

1516
01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:31.860
<v Speaker 5>attack the straw man and then have this</v>
<v Speaker 5>click baity title.</v>

1517
01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:32.371
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1518
01:02:32.371 --> 01:02:35.460
<v Speaker 5>you just need a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need attention or is that what it</v>

1519
01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:36.600
<v Speaker 5>is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not getting the attention.</v>

1520
01:02:36.601 --> 01:02:37.530
<v Speaker 5>They need a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1521
01:02:37.531 --> 01:02:38.260
<v Speaker 5>that's what they need.</v>

1522
01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1523
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:43.120
<v Speaker 2>th this tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has been a freaking love fest.</v>

1524
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:46.540
<v Speaker 2>Every night when I go up there and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>warming up the crowd and I'm doing silly</v>

1525
01:02:46.541 --> 01:02:49.180
<v Speaker 2>lobster jokes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of his other buzz words,</v>

1526
01:02:49.181 --> 01:02:51.370
<v Speaker 2>and I'll talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a couple of jokes about Kathy</v>

1527
01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Newman or like some other silly things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we trying to say is like,</v>

1528
01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.390
<v Speaker 2>I do like a role on though is like five</v>
<v Speaker 2>different lines of like a whole bunch of</v>

1529
01:02:58.391 --> 01:02:59.920
<v Speaker 2>other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like when I,</v>

1530
01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:02.500
<v Speaker 2>I'll go up there and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually make some reference to the</v>

1531
01:03:02.501 --> 01:03:05.410
<v Speaker 2>intellectual dark web.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I say your name or I say Shapiro</v>

1532
01:03:05.411 --> 01:03:08.980
<v Speaker 2>or Sam or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people go crazy.</v>

1533
01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:11.590
<v Speaker 2>And what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm realizing about it is all of</v>

1534
01:03:11.591 --> 01:03:14.530
<v Speaker 2>these people think about all the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however many hundreds of thousands of</v>

1535
01:03:14.531 --> 01:03:16.900
<v Speaker 2>people are watching this or listening to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this right now.</v>

1536
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:19.990
<v Speaker 2>And then how many millions will you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the next two weeks or whatever.</v>

1537
01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.030
<v Speaker 2>Most of them are doing it alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1538
01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:25.180
<v Speaker 2>They're watching on their phone or</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're listening on their IPAD,</v>

1539
01:03:25.181 --> 01:03:27.160
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you're maybe watching with your</v>

1540
01:03:27.161 --> 01:03:28.450
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend or girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But most people,</v>

1541
01:03:28.451 --> 01:03:30.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty solitary experience in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1542
01:03:30.071 --> 01:03:34.360
<v Speaker 2>in the world of what we do now imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like when you do stand up now,</v>

1543
01:03:34.361 --> 01:03:38.740
<v Speaker 2>3000 people piled into this place and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look around and go,</v>

1544
01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some other people like me and</v>

1545
01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:45.490
<v Speaker 2>they're not bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually what I've found is that</v>

1546
01:03:45.491 --> 01:03:47.920
<v Speaker 2>these people look good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they dress right.</v>

1547
01:03:47.921 --> 01:03:50.410
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not to make it all about</v>
<v Speaker 2>material stuff,</v>

1548
01:03:50.411 --> 01:03:53.620
<v Speaker 2>but like they look like people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get their shit together.</v>

1549
01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.930
<v Speaker 2>And I think I said it to you right</v>
<v Speaker 2>before we sat down,</v>

1550
01:03:55.931 --> 01:03:58.810
<v Speaker 2>but me at this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I truly feel like,</v>

1551
01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:01.810
<v Speaker 2>like the best that I've ever been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

1552
01:04:01.811 --> 01:04:06.370
<v Speaker 2>And it's partly because of that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot be around that constantly.</v>

1553
01:04:06.371 --> 01:04:08.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying everything he says is</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and I'm still not with them on</v>

1554
01:04:08.771 --> 01:04:10.660
<v Speaker 2>some of the religious stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have Sam,</v>

1555
01:04:10.661 --> 01:04:14.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing my show when I leave here to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go with Sam Harris and there they,</v>

1556
01:04:14.141 --> 01:04:16.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are really at logger heads on some</v>

1557
01:04:16.301 --> 01:04:16.450
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

1558
01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:18.430
<v Speaker 5>the training need.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a moderator,</v>

1559
01:04:18.431 --> 01:04:20.320
<v Speaker 5>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Sam has said this too.</v>

1560
01:04:20.321 --> 01:04:22.540
<v Speaker 5>I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I was there with the two of them,</v>

1561
01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:26.920
<v Speaker 5>I could worked it out when that whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>truth thing that they bounded back and</v>

1562
01:04:26.921 --> 01:04:29.200
<v Speaker 5>forth for an hour on the meaning of</v>
<v Speaker 5>truth.</v>

1563
01:04:29.590 --> 01:04:32.950
<v Speaker 5>I wish I was there and we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing some live event together.</v>

1564
01:04:32.951 --> 01:04:35.740
<v Speaker 5>We never got around it because Sam's</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing a lot of live events as well.</v>

1565
01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:38.080
<v Speaker 5>So they're doing it with their having</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bret Weinstein,</v>

1566
01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>moderate it.</v>

1567
01:04:39.311 --> 01:04:40.470
<v Speaker 5>But I would have been thrilled if it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

1568
01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:41.900
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love bread and there's nothing about</v>

1569
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:46.450
<v Speaker 5>prep or would be nice like so either it</v>
<v Speaker 5>could have been one of us or or</v>

1570
01:04:46.451 --> 01:04:48.280
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's completely fine.</v>

1571
01:04:48.281 --> 01:04:51.910
<v Speaker 5>And I think they just wanted like a more</v>
<v Speaker 5>sciency focused person and he's a great</v>

1572
01:04:51.911 --> 01:04:54.910
<v Speaker 5>biologist powerhouses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if there's any,</v>

1573
01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:56.710
<v Speaker 5>like they're doing Jujitsu on each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

1574
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:59.380
<v Speaker 5>This is any like openings and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>choke each other.</v>

1575
01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:02.440
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's how we find out if ideas are</v>

1576
01:05:02.441 --> 01:05:03.251
<v Speaker 5>valid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1577
01:05:03.251 --> 01:05:05.590
<v Speaker 5>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll let guys like them discuss them.</v>

1578
01:05:05.591 --> 01:05:07.810
<v Speaker 5>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was very unfortunate that at least</v>

1579
01:05:07.811 --> 01:05:08.760
<v Speaker 5>their first part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First one.</v>

1580
01:05:08.761 --> 01:05:10.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The second one I think was much better,</v>

1581
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:12.670
<v Speaker 5>but the first one was just a cluster</v>
<v Speaker 5>fest.</v>

1582
01:05:12.671 --> 01:05:14.320
<v Speaker 5>I called Sam up afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1583
01:05:14.321 --> 01:05:16.990
<v Speaker 5>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a non conversation you guys.</v>

1584
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:17.661
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1585
01:05:17.661 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 5>I just</v>

1586
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.920
<v Speaker 3>got stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1587
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.330
<v Speaker 3>but think how cool that is that two of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them are.</v>

1588
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:26.230
<v Speaker 3>The two of them are some of our leading</v>
<v Speaker 3>public intellectuals in the country,</v>

1589
01:05:26.231 --> 01:05:27.500
<v Speaker 3>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably [inaudible].</v>

1590
01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:33.460
<v Speaker 3>They're debating over the nature of</v>
<v Speaker 3>truth and millions of people care.</v>

1591
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:37.480
<v Speaker 3>That's a little different than what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on on CNN on any given day.</v>

1592
01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:38.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1593
01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:40.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real problem with mainstream</v>

1594
01:05:40.571 --> 01:05:43.660
<v Speaker 3>news and first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a problem in that it's a ratings</v>

1595
01:05:43.661 --> 01:05:45.790
<v Speaker 3>driven thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like everything they're doing,</v>

1596
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:48.460
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to get ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime there's a big story in the news,</v>

1597
01:05:48.461 --> 01:05:49.211
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

1598
01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:50.390
<v Speaker 3>What are people going to pay attention</v>
<v Speaker 3>to?</v>

1599
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.780
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're going to put on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no consideration.</v>

1600
01:05:52.781 --> 01:05:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this interesting to us?</v>

1601
01:05:54.071 --> 01:05:55.890
<v Speaker 3>Is this what we want to discuss?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1602
01:05:55.891 --> 01:05:58.210
<v Speaker 3>it's a news program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a news program because it's</v>

1603
01:05:58.211 --> 01:06:01.180
<v Speaker 3>also in an entertainment program and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they have commercials every 15</v>

1604
01:06:01.181 --> 01:06:02.014
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

1605
01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Did you say that Jim Acosta thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he did during the,</v>

1606
01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:08.350
<v Speaker 3>during the Korea thing like that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

1607
01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:13.090
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy that a journalist would</v>
<v Speaker 3>insert himself into that sort of a</v>

1608
01:06:13.091 --> 01:06:17.140
<v Speaker 3>situation and interrupt and yell things</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and people don't have a problem with</v>

1609
01:06:17.141 --> 01:06:18.340
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are,</v>

1610
01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:23.490
<v Speaker 3>we are truly watching the implosion of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the media and that's why I meant before,</v>

1611
01:06:23.861 --> 01:06:25.690
<v Speaker 3>it's like if they would just lie a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>

1612
01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:29.200
<v Speaker 3>well just lie a little bit on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>margins as they probably always have</v>

1613
01:06:29.201 --> 01:06:31.390
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we'd be in this position</v>

1614
01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:34.360
<v Speaker 3>because people wouldn't be able to so</v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly see how messed up the whole</v>

1615
01:06:34.361 --> 01:06:37.750
<v Speaker 3>thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But because they've become so hysterical</v>

1616
01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:40.450
<v Speaker 3>writing articles that are completely the</v>
<v Speaker 3>reverse of the truth,</v>

1617
01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:44.560
<v Speaker 3>because they're actually acting like</v>
<v Speaker 3>petulant children all the time and</v>

1618
01:06:44.561 --> 01:06:47.230
<v Speaker 3>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half the time it's like they pretend</v>

1619
01:06:47.231 --> 01:06:49.300
<v Speaker 3>they're nonpartisan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you just look at any of these</v>

1620
01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:50.200
<v Speaker 3>journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter feeds,</v>

1621
01:06:50.201 --> 01:06:52.240
<v Speaker 3>it's like pretty obvious what you all</v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

1622
01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:57.130
<v Speaker 3>All of you in the mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've created an opening so that now</v>

1623
01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:01.780
<v Speaker 3>if people want some sense of truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you turn into Joe Rogan and you're</v>

1624
01:07:01.781 --> 01:07:05.920
<v Speaker 3>turning to all of these other shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very difficult to get</v>

1625
01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:10.630
<v Speaker 3>employment if you're not on one side of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fence or the other side of the fence</v>

1626
01:07:10.631 --> 01:07:12.010
<v Speaker 3>and you're a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

1627
01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:14.530
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a simple world like the world</v>

1628
01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:16.810
<v Speaker 3>of podcasting where you truly can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>independent.</v>

1629
01:07:16.811 --> 01:07:17.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean I think,</v>

1630
01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:19.900
<v Speaker 3>I think in a lot of ways it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood.</v>

1631
01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:22.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've always described Hollywood</v>
<v Speaker 3>is one of the main problems with it.</v>

1632
01:07:22.901 --> 01:07:25.300
<v Speaker 3>As you get a bunch of people that come</v>
<v Speaker 3>here seeking attention,</v>

1633
01:07:25.301 --> 01:07:26.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the reason why they are here in</v>

1634
01:07:26.411 --> 01:07:27.730
<v Speaker 3>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want fame,</v>

1635
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:30.130
<v Speaker 3>they want exorbitant amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>

1636
01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:32.920
<v Speaker 3>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are entered into this system where</v>

1637
01:07:32.921 --> 01:07:35.320
<v Speaker 3>you have to be chosen for each part.</v>

1638
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.590
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you have a sprint and the the guy</v>

1639
01:07:38.591 --> 01:07:40.600
<v Speaker 3>who's the fastest is the one who wins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1640
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:42.970
<v Speaker 3>it does not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's someone's who smelled.</v>

1641
01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you read these lines like,</v>

1642
01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.420
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might like you dave.</v>

1643
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.090
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel about Hillary Clinton?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm pro Clinton.</v>

1644
01:07:49.091 --> 01:07:50.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want Clinton to win.</v>

1645
01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:52.240
<v Speaker 3>Don't we want Clinton to win Dave?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

1646
01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:53.021
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1647
01:07:53.021 --> 01:07:54.980
<v Speaker 3>you'll drop your standards are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1648
01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:57.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm a huge supporter of Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she's amazing.</v>

1649
01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:00.210
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen this because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1650
01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:05.050
<v Speaker 3>it's this weird environment where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want these people to like you.</v>

1651
01:08:05.051 --> 01:08:10.051
<v Speaker 3>So you are terrified of saying anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>even remotely controversial that doesn't</v>

1652
01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:13.340
<v Speaker 3>stick to the script of this left wing</v>
<v Speaker 3>discourse.</v>

1653
01:08:13.341 --> 01:08:14.590
<v Speaker 3>So there's all these people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1654
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:16.550
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just faking it.</v>

1655
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:18.230
<v Speaker 3>They're bullshitting you if they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>

1656
01:08:18.231 --> 01:08:21.800
<v Speaker 3>not even have real opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they've adopted this predetermined</v>

1657
01:08:21.801 --> 01:08:25.220
<v Speaker 3>pattern of opinions that they think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to help them get through the</v>

1658
01:08:25.221 --> 01:08:28.280
<v Speaker 3>door with these producers and these</v>
<v Speaker 3>studio executives.</v>

1659
01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:31.770
<v Speaker 3>And that's Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when someone breaks free and</v>

1660
01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:32.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1661
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.550
<v Speaker 3>occasionally someone becomes right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1662
01:08:34.551 --> 01:08:38.240
<v Speaker 3>whoever the fuck they are with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's chuck woolery or Dennis Miller,</v>

1663
01:08:38.241 --> 01:08:40.820
<v Speaker 3>or they'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that fucking crazy man probe</v>

1664
01:08:40.821 --> 01:08:42.060
<v Speaker 3>from the pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1665
01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:43.550
<v Speaker 3>look at what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's his name,</v>

1666
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:45.920
<v Speaker 3>the fucking actor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The older guy,</v>

1667
01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:48.770
<v Speaker 3>Jon Voight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not Jon voight,</v>

1668
01:08:48.771 --> 01:08:50.940
<v Speaker 3>the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A very good actor.</v>

1669
01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:55.160
<v Speaker 3>Gary sinise got a bigger deck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposedly got in trouble with Dave</v>

1670
01:08:55.161 --> 01:09:00.020
<v Speaker 3>crosses a wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said like Dave Cross's wife said that</v>

1671
01:09:00.021 --> 01:09:02.510
<v Speaker 3>he tried to hit on her when she was 16.</v>
<v Speaker 3>James Woods.</v>

1672
01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:03.730
<v Speaker 3>James Woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1673
01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:04.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1674
01:09:04.690 --> 01:09:06.770
<v Speaker 3>he's really dealt himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a giant deck.</v>

1675
01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I hear.</v>

1676
01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1677
01:09:10.131 --> 01:09:11.780
<v Speaker 2>he's dealt himself in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's all in.</v>

1678
01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:15.050
<v Speaker 2>He's all in and he's like sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>resigned himself to never work again.</v>

1679
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it means,</v>

1680
01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.350
<v Speaker 2>but he's probably like 75 years old or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever he is.</v>

1681
01:09:18.351 --> 01:09:19.640
<v Speaker 2>He's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck anymore.</v>

1682
01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm pretty sure he's got fuck you</v>

1683
01:09:21.441 --> 01:09:22.780
<v Speaker 2>money like probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1684
01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.820
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely saying fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he doesn't have the money that he</v>

1685
01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:28.340
<v Speaker 2>might want to send their data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1686
01:09:28.341 --> 01:09:30.980
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But doesn't that prove though why doing</v>

1687
01:09:30.981 --> 01:09:35.090
<v Speaker 2>this was the right thing to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm very aware right now.</v>

1688
01:09:35.091 --> 01:09:37.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like I got a lot of good shit going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1689
01:09:37.011 --> 01:09:39.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting offers and all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things and I'm like,</v>

1690
01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:40.970
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1691
01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm my own boss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to fire me.</v>

1692
01:09:43.101 --> 01:09:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to accidentally tweet</v>
<v Speaker 2>something one day and then go with that.</v>

1693
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:46.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fire day Ruben.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1694
01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:47.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my,</v>

1695
01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:51.440
<v Speaker 2>my fans fund most of what we do and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I need to grow.</v>

1696
01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Like we definitely need to grow because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1697
01:09:53.241 --> 01:09:54.980
<v Speaker 2>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my guys are just doing too much.</v>

1698
01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.070
<v Speaker 2>But I'm also very aware that the more we</v>
<v Speaker 2>start growing that,</v>

1699
01:09:58.071 --> 01:10:01.910
<v Speaker 2>all the problems that you just laid out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll start becoming more and more real.</v>

1700
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:04.550
<v Speaker 2>So I like being as slim and trim as</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>

1701
01:10:04.551 --> 01:10:09.230
<v Speaker 2>at least for now because I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be down the road where we've had,</v>

1702
01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.990
<v Speaker 2>we got too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too many just different</v>

1703
01:10:11.991 --> 01:10:15.320
<v Speaker 2>competing interests and business</v>
<v Speaker 2>interests and political interests and</v>

1704
01:10:15.321 --> 01:10:16.880
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

1705
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.950
<v Speaker 2>that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're what you're doing here,</v>

1706

<v Speaker 2>it's amazing man.</v>

1707

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:24.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's nice to be able to do it for sure.</v>

1709
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:28.510
<v Speaker 3>It's nice to be able to just have</v>
<v Speaker 3>opinions on things and,</v>

1710
01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:32.720
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also just know that you're a nice</v>

1711
01:10:32.721 --> 01:10:35.420
<v Speaker 3>person and that you're not trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1712
01:10:35.421 --> 01:10:37.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to do any evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm in a,</v>

1713
01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:38.571
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1714
01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:40.730
<v Speaker 3>I look at like who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm a nice guy.</v>

1715
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.903
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1716
01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:43.050
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what are my opinions of,</v>

1717
01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:44.990
<v Speaker 3>why can't I talk to this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can I have,</v>

1718
01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:46.940
<v Speaker 3>what can I have discussions in these</v>
<v Speaker 3>subjects?</v>

1719
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:48.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot of people that feel</v>

1720
01:10:48.921 --> 01:10:52.400
<v Speaker 3>like if you're not in a certain group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't have discussions on</v>

1721
01:10:52.401 --> 01:10:54.170
<v Speaker 3>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a straight man,</v>

1722
01:10:54.171 --> 01:10:56.450
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't talk about gay rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a man,</v>

1723
01:10:56.451 --> 01:10:59.390
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't talk about women's issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't talk about me too.</v>

1724
01:10:59.391 --> 01:11:03.080
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're 100% supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't discuss the subtle nuance</v>

1725
01:11:03.081 --> 01:11:04.430
<v Speaker 3>of human interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1726
01:11:04.431 --> 01:11:05.360
<v Speaker 3>it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Martin Luther King,</v>

1727
01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:07.010
<v Speaker 3>he wanted us to be judged by those</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1728
01:11:07.011 --> 01:11:07.671
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1729
01:11:07.671 --> 01:11:09.610
<v Speaker 3>if you're only this color,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can talk about that.</v>

1730
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:12.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1731
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.120
<v Speaker 1>that's where we're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also,</v>

1732
01:11:15.121 --> 01:11:16.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an article right after that</v>

1733
01:11:16.531 --> 01:11:19.920
<v Speaker 1>idw thing came out in the times that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling you a conservative.</v>

1734
01:11:19.921 --> 01:11:20.431
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1735
01:11:20.431 --> 01:11:23.150
<v Speaker 1>I think I emailed it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1736
01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:26.790
<v Speaker 1>It was the twitter thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The renegade conservative,</v>

1737
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:29.070
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pro Gay rights.</v>

1738
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Pro Women's rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pro choice pro marijuana,</v>

1739
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:36.540
<v Speaker 1>pro universal health care pro universal</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic income.</v>

1740
01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Like what else do I have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what other things am I,</v>

1741
01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:40.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro second amendment.</v>

1742
01:11:40.981 --> 01:11:41.900
<v Speaker 1>He must be right one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1743
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:42.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1744
01:11:42.421 --> 01:11:44.250
<v Speaker 1>you're off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just have you,</v>

1745
01:11:44.251 --> 01:11:47.040
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have a series of thoughts that</v>

1746
01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:50.760
<v Speaker 1>don't all lock in with what you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in a pattern that you have to be in</v>

1747
01:11:50.761 --> 01:11:53.190
<v Speaker 1>the pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not just don't understand why</v>

1748
01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:56.070
<v Speaker 1>someone's willing to be dishonest like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1749
01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Like a cursory examination of people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and positions on things would</v>

1750
01:12:01.711 --> 01:12:04.410
<v Speaker 1>lead someone to realize I'm definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a right wing person,</v>

1751
01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:07.170
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is that they own the</v>

1752
01:12:07.171 --> 01:12:10.070
<v Speaker 1>narrative for so long and that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>still get away with it.</v>

1753
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1754
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:14.580
<v Speaker 1>And what's happening is now it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>shifting and that's what I mean by I</v>

1755
01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:17.400
<v Speaker 1>think we're starting to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean it when like we're</v>

1756
01:12:17.401 --> 01:12:19.530
<v Speaker 1>going to destroy these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1757
01:12:19.531 --> 01:12:24.150
<v Speaker 1>I think the narrative has started to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shift a little bit where the enthusiasm</v>

1758
01:12:24.151 --> 01:12:26.340
<v Speaker 1>behind the conversations that we're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>

1759
01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:30.660
<v Speaker 1>whoever it is in this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the enthusiasm is so great and there is</v>

1760
01:12:30.661 --> 01:12:34.440
<v Speaker 1>no counter enthusiasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where are all the versions of us on</v>

1761
01:12:34.441 --> 01:12:36.750
<v Speaker 1>the other side of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bright,</v>

1762
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.460
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even mean on the right,</v>

1763
01:12:38.461 --> 01:12:42.570
<v Speaker 1>like the people that really are selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity politics had a really great way</v>

1764
01:12:42.571 --> 01:12:46.410
<v Speaker 1>at a comedy level who have a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and like where is the,</v>

1765
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:48.030
<v Speaker 1>where is that intellectual set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

1766
01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Where's the Sam Harris of the other side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this or the that have real</v>

1767
01:12:51.031 --> 01:12:53.730
<v Speaker 1>followings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't exist and that's partly why</v>

1768
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.620
<v Speaker 1>the hysteria has been ramped up.</v>

1769
01:12:55.650 --> 01:12:59.390
<v Speaker 1>They can't believe that out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because of our,</v>

1770
01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:04.320
<v Speaker 1>all of our just wherewithal and desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do what we think is right or what</v>

1771
01:13:04.321 --> 01:13:06.210
<v Speaker 1>makes us happy or whatever the hell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to call it.</v>

1772
01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.880
<v Speaker 1>They can't believe we all freaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>created something.</v>

1773
01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the queer shout that we're all in a</v>

1774
01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:13.030
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm weirded out that we're in a super</v>

1775
01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:17.220
<v Speaker 1>boy band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in a boy band or I guess Christina</v>

1776
01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:18.053
<v Speaker 1>Hoff Summers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that band too?</v>

1777
01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Who else is in that band?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Heather in it?</v>

1778
01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has it in hang a sheet in there.</v>

1779

<v Speaker 1>we don't have to Brett,</v>

1780
01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:25.110
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't get the car yet and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the card.</v>

1781
01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.420

<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1782
01:13:27.421 --> 01:13:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Shapiro with joking around about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like we're like the super friends,</v>

1783
01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:32.850
<v Speaker 1>like what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the weirdest avengers ever.</v>

1784
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:35.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird group of humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean me and Ben,</v>

1785
01:13:35.341 --> 01:13:38.280
<v Speaker 1>we disagree on a lot of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're super friendly to each other.</v>

1786
01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Like when I do his show or he does my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoy that guy like him.</v>

1787

<v Speaker 1>You do freaking Shapiro show before my</v>
<v Speaker 1>show what?</v>

1789
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:49.620
<v Speaker 1>The guys had a shelf for three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were mad at me with the way I</v>

1790
01:13:49.621 --> 01:13:50.850
<v Speaker 1>dressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that.</v>

1791
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:54.310
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else is wearing a nice shirt</v>

1792
01:13:54.311 --> 01:13:54.811
<v Speaker 1>at a time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to take a photo of me?</v>

1795
01:13:58.591 --> 01:14:00.450

<v Speaker 1>You're not in the bush.</v>

1796

<v Speaker 1>In the brush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I everybody down sucking it up my ass.</v>

1798
01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing a fucking chucks or converse</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a some sort of a flannel shirt that</v>

1799
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I bought that jacket Alaska.</v>

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it was where I just,</v>

1801
01:14:16.751 --> 01:14:19.990
<v Speaker 1>what I was wearing at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1802
01:14:19.991 --> 01:14:21.790
<v Speaker 1>all right man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm wearing.</v>

1803
01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:24.420
<v Speaker 1>No greenery around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The comedy store could go up to sunset,</v>

1804
01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:28.360
<v Speaker 1>but either way I just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

1805
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:29.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what I looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's who I am.</v>

1806
01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in portraying an</v>
<v Speaker 1>image.</v>

1807
01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Just it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1808
01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this intellectual dark web like it's</v>

1809
01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:42.190
<v Speaker 1>fucking Eric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's crazy and he's,</v>

1810
01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:44.470
<v Speaker 1>he gets mad when I call him crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves it.</v>

1811
01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:46.780
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to get me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you on the whatsapp?</v>

1812
01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:47.643
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the one hand.</v>

1813
01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.480

<v Speaker 1>I've been busy.</v>

1815
01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:57.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just two or three messages a day for</v>

1816
01:14:57.641 --> 01:15:01.930
<v Speaker 1>different group text conversations with</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians were talking shit about things</v>

1817
01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:02.590
<v Speaker 1>and talking around.</v>

1818
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm busy,</v>

1819
01:15:04.751 --> 01:15:05.680
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1820
01:15:05.681 --> 01:15:07.930
<v Speaker 1>well then you can't come to the club</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to make a yoga class.</v>

1821
01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:09.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking time.</v>

1822
01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell goes like are we a group</v>

1823
01:15:12.281 --> 01:15:14.560
<v Speaker 1>that we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a meeting and shall act cards</v>

1824
01:15:14.561 --> 01:15:18.430
<v Speaker 1>and like we have in common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have a respect for our</v>

1825
01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:21.940
<v Speaker 1>audience and intellectual curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Curiosity for sure.</v>

1826
01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1827
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:27.370
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where a guy like me and Shapiro,</v>

1828
01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.820
<v Speaker 1>although we have very different opinions</v>
<v Speaker 1>on many different things,</v>

1829
01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:34.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we both are intellectually</v>

1830
01:15:34.541 --> 01:15:35.410
<v Speaker 1>curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1831
01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.600
<v Speaker 1>So think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had been on many times,</v>

1832
01:15:37.601 --> 01:15:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I consider him a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

1833
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.140
<v Speaker 1>we've broke bread together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he's kosher,</v>

1834
01:15:41.141 --> 01:15:43.270
<v Speaker 1>which makes it fucking pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you have to eat?</v>

1835
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Has such a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Follow that blue,</v>

1836
01:15:45.991 --> 01:15:46.570
<v Speaker 1>do well.</v>

1837
01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:48.790
<v Speaker 1>I eat whatever the hell it to him about</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever I want.</v>

1838
01:15:48.791 --> 01:15:50.990
<v Speaker 1>But he usually brings something or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1839
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:52.780
<v Speaker 1>has to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did a kosher restaurant.</v>

1840
01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I did eat at a kosher restaurant with</v>
<v Speaker 1>him once,</v>

1841
01:15:54.911 --> 01:15:57.550
<v Speaker 1>but then it was all these orthodox Jews</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and then they treat him like</v>

1842
01:15:57.551 --> 01:15:58.301
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1843
01:15:58.301 --> 01:15:59.770
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a photographer.</v>

1844
01:15:59.771 --> 01:16:01.360
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to take all these pictures of</v>

1845
01:16:01.361 --> 01:16:01.841
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1846
01:16:01.841 --> 01:16:02.690
<v Speaker 1>who's that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1847
01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's funny,</v>

1848
01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:06.190
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had Shapiro and look,</v>

1849
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.460
<v Speaker 1>he's not inherently for gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1850
01:16:09.461 --> 01:16:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I've had my studio is in my house where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew what his thoughts on gay</v>

1851
01:16:12.431 --> 01:16:12.850
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1852
01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:14.610
<v Speaker 1>now he takes the Libertarian position</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

1853
01:16:14.611 --> 01:16:16.180
<v Speaker 1>which is the government shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>

1854
01:16:16.181 --> 01:16:18.610
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I see a lot of conservatives doing</v>

1855
01:16:18.611 --> 01:16:20.530
<v Speaker 1>that where they should have all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1856
01:16:20.531 --> 01:16:22.420
<v Speaker 1>this is where Rand Paul Lynn mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

1857
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:25.660
<v Speaker 1>he should have been years ago screaming</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's for gay marriage because if</v>

1858
01:16:25.661 --> 01:16:28.610
<v Speaker 1>you're truly a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government doesn't delaminate the</v>

1859
01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:31.360
<v Speaker 1>smoke was sleep with the libertarians.</v>

1860
01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:34.780
<v Speaker 1>She could have taken a really awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

1861
01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.960
<v Speaker 1>principled position and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't about religion.</v>

1862
01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:39.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about freedom.</v>

1863
01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.980
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that a shove in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the face of people that were Hillary</v>

1864
01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Clinton supporters and my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know that she didn't support gay</v>

1865
01:16:43.931 --> 01:16:46.100
<v Speaker 1>marriage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll 2013 you know,</v>

1866
01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:47.260
<v Speaker 1>goddamn crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1867
01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I supported it when I was 13 this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking grown up old lady with</v>

1868
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:53.960
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1869
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Is Talent people that she's not for gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage until it became convenient</v>

1870
01:16:57.491 --> 01:17:01.740
<v Speaker 1>politically and she just wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate herself as being at least the</v>

1871
01:17:01.741 --> 01:17:05.270
<v Speaker 1>semi conservative option compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama.</v>

1872
01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama was not for gay marriage at</v>

1873
01:17:07.601 --> 01:17:08.920
<v Speaker 1>the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got pinned into it.</v>

1874
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Biden made that stupid</v>

1875
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:12.170
<v Speaker 2>comment on meet the press where he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically like,</v>

1876
01:17:12.171 --> 01:17:13.970
<v Speaker 2>everyone's forward and then Obama had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come out for it.</v>

1877
01:17:13.971 --> 01:17:15.170
<v Speaker 2>But think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

1878
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:18.170
<v Speaker 2>if all of this stuff that we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about keeps winning,</v>

1879
01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:21.770
<v Speaker 2>if it all keeps winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will happen in 50 years,</v>

1880
01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:25.460
<v Speaker 2>they will literally look back at video</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Barack Obama campaigning the first</v>

1881
01:17:25.461 --> 01:17:28.730
<v Speaker 2>time around saying that he's for</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional marriage and they will call</v>

1882
01:17:28.731 --> 01:17:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Barack Obama a homophobe and they will</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually want them.</v>

1883
01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:35.600
<v Speaker 2>They will want the Barack Obama library</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's being built now in Chicago.</v>

1884
01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:38.150
<v Speaker 2>They will want that being taken down</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that will be the,</v>

1885
01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:41.690
<v Speaker 2>that will be the statues of our day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that that's why I don't know where</v>

1886
01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:44.480
<v Speaker 2>you're at on the monument stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would not take any of them down.</v>

1887
01:17:44.481 --> 01:17:48.110
<v Speaker 2>You can put up a counselor plaque or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something right next to it to say Robert</v>

1888
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.943
<v Speaker 2>E.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee did this or that,</v>

1889
01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.610
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that they're removing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit I think is absolutely terrible.</v>

1890
01:17:52.611 --> 01:17:53.720
<v Speaker 2>You can't erase history.</v>

1891
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:54.641
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you.</v>

1892
01:17:54.641 --> 01:17:56.770
<v Speaker 5>I think they should.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a problem with having them in</v>

1893
01:17:56.771 --> 01:17:59.980
<v Speaker 5>town squares and celebrating them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's also a problem that they</v>

1894
01:17:59.981 --> 01:18:01.510
<v Speaker 5>were all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most of them,</v>

1895
01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:04.120
<v Speaker 5>the ones that you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're talking about in the south.</v>

1896
01:18:04.121 --> 01:18:07.000
<v Speaker 5>They were resurrected during the civil</v>
<v Speaker 5>rights movement to sort of counteract</v>

1897
01:18:07.001 --> 01:18:09.040
<v Speaker 5>the civil rights movement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like these,</v>

1898
01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:13.120
<v Speaker 5>these are really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not like a celebration of these</v>

1899
01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:16.300
<v Speaker 5>people back in the day when they were a</v>
<v Speaker 5>viable,</v>

1900
01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:18.310
<v Speaker 5>this is during the civil rights</v>
<v Speaker 5>movement.</v>

1901
01:18:18.311 --> 01:18:23.311
<v Speaker 5>They erected these fairly cheap and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>put them up quickly and they did it in</v>

1902
01:18:23.321 --> 01:18:27.760
<v Speaker 5>response to black people wanting more</v>
<v Speaker 5>rights and you know,</v>

1903
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:29.310
<v Speaker 5>they would still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would still face,</v>

1904
01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:29.940
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1905
01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would still be not for taking them</v>

1906
01:18:32.491 --> 01:18:33.900
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put up something next to it,</v>

1907
01:18:33.901 --> 01:18:36.180
<v Speaker 2>you put it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see what I would you want to come?</v>

1908
01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:39.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm for taking it down and replacing</v>
<v Speaker 5>them with something else and putting</v>

1909
01:18:39.631 --> 01:18:41.640
<v Speaker 5>them somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you want to have a civil war</v>

1910
01:18:41.641 --> 01:18:43.800
<v Speaker 5>museum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that would be the compromise where</v>

1911
01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:45.870
<v Speaker 5>you could get me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying you should melt them,</v>

1912
01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.480
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something too,</v>

1913
01:18:49.170 --> 01:18:53.400
<v Speaker 5>there's something to the argument that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're racist statues and especially if</v>

1914
01:18:53.401 --> 01:18:56.100
<v Speaker 5>you understand the motivation behind</v>
<v Speaker 5>creating them in the first place.</v>

1915
01:18:56.130 --> 01:18:57.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem though is that,</v>

1916
01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:58.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1917
01:18:58.911 --> 01:19:01.320
<v Speaker 2>I know you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it never ends where it's supposed to</v>

1918
01:19:01.321 --> 01:19:01.860
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>

1919
01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:04.410
<v Speaker 5>wanted to go after George Washington and</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump said they did.</v>

1920
01:19:04.530 --> 01:19:07.410
<v Speaker 5>Trump said that and people were riddick</v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculing him.</v>

1921
01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.890
<v Speaker 5>And then almost immediately afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone wanted to take down a statue of</v>

1922
01:19:10.891 --> 01:19:11.610
<v Speaker 5>George Wallace.</v>

1923
01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I was in old town Alexandria where</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Washington's Church was,</v>

1924
01:19:15.601 --> 01:19:17.340
<v Speaker 2>and it's actually the same church that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert E.</v>

1925
01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Lee went to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had a plaque for both of them.</v>

1926
01:19:19.081 --> 01:19:21.630
<v Speaker 2>And because they took down the Robert E.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee One,</v>

1927
01:19:21.631 --> 01:19:25.290
<v Speaker 2>they also took down the George</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington one at the church that George</v>

1928
01:19:25.290 --> 01:19:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Washington went to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1929
01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:29.340
<v Speaker 2>if you follow that logic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what you have to do when</v>

1930
01:19:29.341 --> 01:19:30.570
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing these sort of</v>

1931
01:19:30.571 --> 01:19:34.170
<v Speaker 2>historical trackings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will come for everything.</v>

1932
01:19:34.171 --> 01:19:36.780
<v Speaker 2>So think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Jefferson's my favorite founder,</v>

1933
01:19:36.930 --> 01:19:39.180
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Jefferson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go to his house in Monte Cello</v>

1934
01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:40.890
<v Speaker 2>and they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go on the tour,</v>

1935
01:19:40.891 --> 01:19:43.500
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are incredibly honest about his</v>

1936
01:19:43.501 --> 01:19:46.170
<v Speaker 2>relationship to slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he owned slaves his whole life.</v>

1937
01:19:46.171 --> 01:19:49.650
<v Speaker 2>He was having an affair with at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>one slave and most likely had children</v>

1938
01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:53.100
<v Speaker 2>with that slave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the same time he was writing the laws</v>

1939
01:19:53.101 --> 01:19:55.590
<v Speaker 2>that freed the slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So without this man,</v>

1940
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:59.030
<v Speaker 2>these things don't move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we all live with these odd in</v>

1941
01:19:59.031 --> 01:20:00.540
<v Speaker 2>consistencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Washington,</v>

1942
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:03.780
<v Speaker 2>George Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who gave up power after the,</v>

1943
01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:06.690
<v Speaker 2>after the revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he did the most incredible thing.</v>

1944
01:20:06.691 --> 01:20:08.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he a power as the commander</v>

1945
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:12.210
<v Speaker 1>of the army after the revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most incredible thing that a leader</v>

1946
01:20:12.211 --> 01:20:15.870
<v Speaker 1>of a country could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He owned slaves his entire life when he</v>

1947
01:20:15.871 --> 01:20:18.000
<v Speaker 1>died and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do this at his house in,</v>

1948
01:20:18.001 --> 01:20:19.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's out.</v>

1949
01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:21.070
<v Speaker 1>It's outside DC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm blanking on it for a second.</v>

1950
01:20:21.071 --> 01:20:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll get in a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can go on the tour there.</v>

1951
01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:26.550
<v Speaker 1>And he had his slaves his entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he died,</v>

1952
01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:29.700
<v Speaker 1>his half of the slaves got freed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Martha Washington's half didn't,</v>

1953
01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Martha kept a slot that kept this bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1954
01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:38.220
<v Speaker 1>So it's like all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like so surely had half the slaves</v>

1955
01:20:38.221 --> 01:20:42.000
<v Speaker 1>were kind of inherited them I think from</v>
<v Speaker 1>her parents or something like that.</v>

1956
01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Like it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's deeply twisted and warped.</v>

1957
01:20:44.731 --> 01:20:49.410
<v Speaker 1>And of course it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now of course we can objectively look at</v>

1958
01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:51.840
<v Speaker 1>it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery was wrong and you shouldn't of</v>

1959
01:20:51.841 --> 01:20:52.674
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

1960
01:20:53.250 --> 01:20:56.040
<v Speaker 1>But they all were doing things in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>time that you'd,</v>

1961
01:20:56.041 --> 01:20:59.430
<v Speaker 1>the world doesn't magically become what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want it to be just because you exist</v>

1962
01:20:59.431 --> 01:21:02.160
<v Speaker 1>and think something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more that we start thinking</v>

1963
01:21:02.161 --> 01:21:03.810
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more we'll eventually come after</v>

1964
01:21:03.811 --> 01:21:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Obama for running against gay marriage</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time and,</v>

1965
01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:09.250
<v Speaker 1>and all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is something that we think you</v>

1966
01:21:09.251 --> 01:21:10.081
<v Speaker 1>love meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1967
01:21:10.081 --> 01:21:11.850
<v Speaker 1>You love elk and all this other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

1968
01:21:11.851 --> 01:21:14.730
<v Speaker 1>One day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this craziness keeps going,</v>

1969
01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:18.110
<v Speaker 1>they will look back when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandfather and there'll be like date</v>

1970
01:21:18.150 --> 01:21:20.370
<v Speaker 1>meet because we're at that point we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>be eating,</v>

1971
01:21:20.371 --> 01:21:22.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificially produced whatever.</v>

1972
01:21:22.291 --> 01:21:24.600
<v Speaker 1>And they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll literally watch videos of you</v>

1973
01:21:24.601 --> 01:21:25.650
<v Speaker 1>chomping on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1974
01:21:25.651 --> 01:21:28.500
<v Speaker 1>some ribs and go see what a savage he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

1975
01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:32.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you have to just be aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what your time is.</v>

1976
01:21:32.190 --> 01:21:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Your time in this world.</v>

1977
01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it right now.</v>

1978
01:21:34.651 --> 01:21:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1979
01:21:35.611 --> 01:21:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you ever see the video of Obama</v>

1980
01:21:37.621 --> 01:21:40.200
<v Speaker 1>talking about illegal immigration?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

1981
01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.960
<v Speaker 1>It's really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's when he was a senator and running</v>

1982
01:21:42.961 --> 01:21:47.130
<v Speaker 1>for president the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he is more like,</v>

1983
01:21:47.131 --> 01:21:49.230
<v Speaker 1>he's stricter than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than trump.</v>

1984
01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a fascinating thing because</v>

1985
01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.450
<v Speaker 1>no one brings that up and no one called</v>
<v Speaker 1>him braced.</v>

1986
01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:59.400
<v Speaker 1>But I guess we're dealing with a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago,</v>

1987
01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:00.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1988
01:22:00.811 --> 01:22:01.940
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

1989
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:04.590
<v Speaker 1>it was a 2011 it was doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a senator,</v>

1990
01:22:04.591 --> 01:22:07.080
<v Speaker 1>so it was probably around 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2011,</v>

1991
01:22:07.081 --> 01:22:07.891
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1992
01:22:07.891 --> 01:22:09.000
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things there,</v>

1993
01:22:09.001 --> 01:22:09.411
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1994
01:22:09.411 --> 01:22:10.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's black number one.</v>

1995
01:22:10.591 --> 01:22:12.930
<v Speaker 1>So it's like they're not going to call</v>
<v Speaker 1>him racist.</v>

1996
01:22:12.931 --> 01:22:15.000
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it creates a thing where they can't</v>

1997
01:22:15.001 --> 01:22:16.830
<v Speaker 1>compute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that actually mean?</v>

1998
01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.770
<v Speaker 1>He was saying the things that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to hear.</v>

1999
01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:22.770
<v Speaker 1>He also wanted it to be elected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to be elected.</v>

2000
01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:26.450
<v Speaker 1>So they elevated him to a point that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was God play that he was pulseless</v>

2001
01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:29.200
<v Speaker 1>listened to this 2005,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2005.</v>

2002
01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says early.</v>

2003
01:22:30.361 --> 01:22:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's on the need to better secure the</v>

2004
01:22:34.531 --> 01:22:38.970
<v Speaker 1>border and a punish employers who chose</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hire illegal immigrants.</v>

2005
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2006
01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:42.810
<v Speaker 1>we are a generous and welcoming people</v>
<v Speaker 1>here in the United States,</v>

2007
01:22:42.811 --> 01:22:46.350
<v Speaker 1>but those who enter the country</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegally and those who employ them</v>

2008
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:48.800
<v Speaker 1>disrespect the rule of law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2009
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:54.110
<v Speaker 1>and they are showing disregard for those</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are following the law.</v>

2010
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:59.990
<v Speaker 1>We simply cannot allow people to pour</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the United States undetected,</v>

2011
01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:05.110
<v Speaker 1>undocumented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unchecked and circumventing the line of</v>

2012
01:23:05.111 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 1>people who are waiting</v>

2013
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:07.570
<v Speaker 6>patiently,</v>
<v Speaker 6>diligently,</v>

2014
01:23:07.571 --> 01:23:08.710
<v Speaker 6>and lawfully,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2015
01:23:09.010 --> 01:23:14.010
<v Speaker 6>to become immigrants in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's why we need to start by giving</v>

2016
01:23:14.111 --> 01:23:16.900
<v Speaker 6>agencies charged with border security,</v>
<v Speaker 6>new technology,</v>

2017
01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.190
<v Speaker 6>new facilities,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and more people to stop the process and</v>

2018
01:23:21.191 --> 01:23:25.120
<v Speaker 6>deport illegal immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Having said that,</v>

2019
01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:30.220
<v Speaker 6>securing the borders alone does not</v>
<v Speaker 6>solve immigration management.</v>

2020
01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:35.020
<v Speaker 6>We're going to have to better manage</v>
<v Speaker 6>legal immigration in order to end</v>

2021
01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:37.420
<v Speaker 6>illegal immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2022
01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:39.850
<v Speaker 6>senators,</v>
<v Speaker 6>mccain and Kennedy point us in the right</v>

2023
01:23:39.851 --> 01:23:44.470
<v Speaker 6>direction on that point right now we've</v>
<v Speaker 6>got millions of illegal immigrants who</v>

2024
01:23:44.471 --> 01:23:48.820
<v Speaker 6>live and work here without knowing their</v>
<v Speaker 6>identity or background.</v>

2025
01:23:49.450 --> 01:23:53.410
<v Speaker 6>That's part of the reason that we need a</v>
<v Speaker 6>guest worker program to replace the</v>

2026
01:23:53.411 --> 01:23:58.240
<v Speaker 6>flood of illegals with a regulated</v>
<v Speaker 6>stream of legals who enter the United</v>

2027
01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.810
<v Speaker 6>States after checks and with access to</v>
<v Speaker 6>labor rights.</v>

2028
01:24:01.811 --> 01:24:06.811
<v Speaker 6>Part of the reason that illegal</v>
<v Speaker 6>immigration is so damaging is that it</v>

2029
01:24:06.911 --> 01:24:11.860
<v Speaker 6>ends up creating a pool of workers with</v>
<v Speaker 6>depressed wages and no rights.</v>

2030
01:24:11.890 --> 01:24:14.380
<v Speaker 6>And that's not something that we find</v>
<v Speaker 6>acceptable.</v>

2031
01:24:14.381 --> 01:24:17.470
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>American employers also need to take</v>

2032
01:24:17.471 --> 01:24:18.340
<v Speaker 6>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2033
01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:21.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just scribbled down like I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing homework in seventh grade and</v>

2034
01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:24.140
<v Speaker 2>think about what he said there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to secure the border,</v>

2035
01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:26.380
<v Speaker 2>secure the border trunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secure the border,</v>

2036
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:30.740
<v Speaker 2>punish you if you hire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you hire illegal workers,</v>

2037
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:32.520
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you enter illegally,</v>

2038
01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:34.370
<v Speaker 2>you're showing disregard for our laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2039
01:24:34.371 --> 01:24:36.890
<v Speaker 2>we cannot allow illegals to pour in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2040
01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:39.920
<v Speaker 2>we can't let them go ahead of lawful</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are trying to enter the</v>

2041
01:24:39.921 --> 01:24:41.750
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need better border security,</v>

2042
01:24:41.751 --> 01:24:44.150
<v Speaker 2>more pr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more process and deportations.</v>

2043
01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to better manage legal</v>

2044
01:24:45.771 --> 01:24:47.720
<v Speaker 2>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he talked about the millions</v>

2045
01:24:47.721 --> 01:24:49.370
<v Speaker 2>that are here now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in effect is a pathway to</v>

2046
01:24:49.371 --> 01:24:50.420
<v Speaker 2>citizenship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

2047
01:24:50.421 --> 01:24:53.570
<v Speaker 2>trump is basically four at some level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

2048
01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:58.220
<v Speaker 2>so what are we really talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time we scream that everybody is</v>

2049
01:24:58.221 --> 01:24:59.750
<v Speaker 2>racist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did.</v>

2050
01:24:59.751 --> 01:25:02.030
<v Speaker 2>He just make a wild what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

2051
01:25:02.031 --> 01:25:03.410
<v Speaker 2>I assume he's talking about Latino</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2052
01:25:03.411 --> 01:25:07.310
<v Speaker 2>So as Barack Obama racist against Latino</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2053
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:10.770
<v Speaker 3>Well this was when he was a senator</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ellis.</v>

2054
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:15.790
<v Speaker 3>Like he was elected in 2008 and so he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was probably gearing up to run when he</v>

2055
01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:18.980
<v Speaker 3>was in 2005 the things that he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

2056
01:25:18.981 --> 01:25:22.490
<v Speaker 3>he was letting people know who he is and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's out there and starting the</v>

2057
01:25:22.491 --> 01:25:27.491
<v Speaker 3>ball rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know this a different time to 2005</v>

2058
01:25:28.671 --> 01:25:32.570
<v Speaker 3>was just a different world and it seems</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it shouldn't be because it was only</v>

2059
01:25:32.571 --> 01:25:34.820
<v Speaker 3>13 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but God damn is it different?</v>

2060
01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.180
<v Speaker 3>So what does that say then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

2061
01:25:36.181 --> 01:25:39.890
<v Speaker 3>what does that actually say about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way things have changed or the cult of</v>

2062
01:25:39.891 --> 01:25:44.720
<v Speaker 3>personality around trump or just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the general derangement of the media</v>

2063
01:25:44.721 --> 01:25:47.420
<v Speaker 3>that they can't view these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just a media.</v>

2064
01:25:47.421 --> 01:25:50.090
<v Speaker 3>I think it's also people's access to</v>
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>

2065
01:25:50.091 --> 01:25:53.030
<v Speaker 3>The fact that anyone can voice their</v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion,</v>

2066
01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.790
<v Speaker 3>whether it's on facebook or youtube or</v>
<v Speaker 3>what have you,</v>

2067
01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:56.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2068
01:25:56.741 --> 01:25:58.550
<v Speaker 3>it's a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twitter,</v>

2069
01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:00.830
<v Speaker 3>you can just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just tweet instantaneously.</v>

2070
01:26:00.831 --> 01:26:02.390
<v Speaker 3>This is fucking bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2071
01:26:02.391 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 3>people should be able to whatever they</v>
<v Speaker 3>want or whatever,</v>

2072
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:05.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to say.</v>

2073
01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:09.160
<v Speaker 1>And then a bunch of people can agree or</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree or retweeted or do you know or</v>

2074
01:26:09.161 --> 01:26:13.460
<v Speaker 1>or or screen grab it because they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's damaging to you and they put</v>

2075
01:26:13.461 --> 01:26:15.080
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't believe you support this piece of</v>

2076
01:26:15.081 --> 01:26:17.960
<v Speaker 1>shit and think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can wake up on any given morning,</v>

2077
01:26:17.961 --> 01:26:20.810
<v Speaker 1>find someone you've never heard of who</v>
<v Speaker 1>said something you slightly disagree</v>

2078
01:26:20.811 --> 01:26:22.730
<v Speaker 1>with and you can help get them fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of,</v>

2079
01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people want to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

2080
01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:27.980
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to get people fired for opinions.</v>

2081
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Does that doesn't make a lot of sense to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2082
01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.360
<v Speaker 1>but really if we were to do a deep dive</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that,</v>

2083
01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:34.910
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what did we just hear that is</v>

2084
01:26:34.911 --> 01:26:37.400
<v Speaker 1>different than what trump is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do right now?</v>

2085
01:26:37.410 --> 01:26:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Does trump you sloppy language?</v>

2086
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does trump lie?</v>

2087
01:26:40.221 --> 01:26:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they all lie.</v>

2088
01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like your doctor,</v>

2089
01:26:43.431 --> 01:26:46.180
<v Speaker 1>you can keep your doctor lie Siri or red</v>
<v Speaker 1>line the lie.</v>

2090
01:26:46.181 --> 01:26:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Those are pretty big lies that he did</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as trump lie about everything</v>

2091
01:26:50.151 --> 01:26:51.380
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2092
01:26:51.381 --> 01:26:55.070
<v Speaker 1>but what he has a way of doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting these odd big picture things</v>

2093
01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:57.090
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it causes this.</v>

2094
01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:02.120
<v Speaker 1>So like almost anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like they'll say you okay.</v>

2095
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:03.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in the last couple of days with</v>

2096
01:27:03.591 --> 01:27:06.920
<v Speaker 1>North Korea that trump said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2097
01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I've been traveling a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like getting the exact quote,</v>

2098
01:27:09.181 --> 01:27:10.880
<v Speaker 1>it'll be tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll be something like,</v>

2099
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:12.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2100
01:27:12.831 --> 01:27:15.250
<v Speaker 1>trump said to the North Korean dictator</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are,</v>

2101
01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:17.180
<v Speaker 1>that they're good friends now or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2102
01:27:17.181 --> 01:27:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Like he's already giving him respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2103
01:27:19.341 --> 01:27:21.110
<v Speaker 1>it's like if Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama,</v>

2104
01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:23.300
<v Speaker 1>when Obama ran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said he would sit down with aqua,</v>

2105
01:27:23.301 --> 01:27:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Diana died and he would sit down with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leaders in North Korea and the rest</v>

2106
01:27:25.971 --> 01:27:26.360
<v Speaker 1>of those things.</v>

2107
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Now trump is doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

2108
01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:31.160
<v Speaker 1>do you want him to sit down with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tell him to go fuck himself at the</v>

2109
01:27:31.161 --> 01:27:33.150
<v Speaker 1>same time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not even saying this things</v>

2110
01:27:33.170 --> 01:27:34.970
<v Speaker 1>good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no freaking clue.</v>

2111
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has a clue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everyone has every opinion on</v>

2112
01:27:38.361 --> 01:27:39.230
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2113
01:27:39.231 --> 01:27:42.310
<v Speaker 1>people want them to fail too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fascinating to me because you</v>

2114
01:27:42.330 --> 01:27:43.880
<v Speaker 1>see the Bill Maher side?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2115
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:48.680
<v Speaker 1>So Bill Maher on Bill Maher on Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that he's hoping for a recession</v>

2116
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:50.870
<v Speaker 1>because that's how we'll get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>

2117
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked a little bit about bill before</v>

2118
01:27:54.021 --> 01:27:54.710
<v Speaker 1>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

2119
01:27:54.710 --> 01:27:56.690
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been a huge influence of mine.</v>

2120
01:27:56.691 --> 01:27:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to want to be on the show.</v>

2121
01:27:58.341 --> 01:28:00.080
<v Speaker 1>I've kind of moved past that at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

2122
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:01.340
<v Speaker 1>but think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2123
01:28:01.341 --> 01:28:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Bill is probably worth a hundred million</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks or something.</v>

2124
01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:06.590
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like he can afford living through a</v>

2125
01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:09.050
<v Speaker 1>recession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when people talk about the liberal</v>

2126
01:28:09.051 --> 01:28:11.540
<v Speaker 1>elite that they hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that type of person.</v>

2127
01:28:11.541 --> 01:28:13.040
<v Speaker 1>It's this person on the coast who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2128
01:28:13.041 --> 01:28:13.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2129
01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:15.500
<v Speaker 1>have a recession so we can get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>

2130
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I hope he does amazingly well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2131
01:28:20.031 --> 01:28:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I hope trump does amazing the well in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of country when I hope he evolves</v>

2132
01:28:23.571 --> 01:28:25.940
<v Speaker 1>his ideas as a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope he does.</v>

2133
01:28:25.941 --> 01:28:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Mushrooms</v>
<v Speaker 1>grows to love people.</v>

2134
01:28:30.051 --> 01:28:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Why would you hope for failure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially failure for the whole country</v>

2135
01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:36.800
<v Speaker 1>and sending people into a recession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is undoubtedly going to cause</v>

2136
01:28:36.801 --> 01:28:41.540
<v Speaker 1>suicides and turmoil and crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are going to go into panic</v>

2137
01:28:41.541 --> 01:28:44.570
<v Speaker 1>thinking and panic voting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not what you want.</v>

2138
01:28:44.571 --> 01:28:46.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally that's what started Hitler.</v>

2139
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:47.671
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2140
01:28:47.671 --> 01:28:49.550
<v Speaker 1>that's what started Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2141
01:28:49.551 --> 01:28:53.040
<v Speaker 1>They were in the middle of a horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>recession and this guy came along that</v>

2142
01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:56.540
<v Speaker 1>proposed a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get a better version</v>

2143
01:28:56.990 --> 01:29:01.740
<v Speaker 1>of the future by people living in fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>and poverty and sadness.</v>

2144
01:29:01.741 --> 01:29:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

2145
01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:06.330
<v Speaker 3>I as</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't vote for trump,</v>

2146
01:29:06.331 --> 01:29:08.700
<v Speaker 3>but he's the president I want him to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

2147
01:29:09.150 --> 01:29:12.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with him on a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lies about a lot of shit.</v>

2148
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still want them to do great.</v>

2149
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:17.340
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he is the guy that's running the</v>

2150
01:29:17.341 --> 01:29:20.520
<v Speaker 3>country visa running the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want the country to do well no matter</v>

2151
01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:22.530
<v Speaker 3>who's running it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

2152
01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.430
<v Speaker 3>my thought was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is almost what it's like.</v>

2153
01:29:25.431 --> 01:29:26.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like this doctor,</v>

2154
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:29.280
<v Speaker 3>so when he fixes my knee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope you box it up.</v>

2155
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:30.210
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2156
01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:32.730
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really almost what it's like.</v>

2157
01:29:32.731 --> 01:29:35.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's the God damn president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2158
01:29:35.431 --> 01:29:37.950
<v Speaker 3>If you want him to be in peach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's done some fucking horrible</v>

2159
01:29:37.951 --> 01:29:39.990
<v Speaker 3>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I still,</v>

2160
01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:44.410
<v Speaker 3>I've gone over all this Russian stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still am not convinced that he did</v>

2161
01:29:44.411 --> 01:29:45.150
<v Speaker 3>anything horrible.</v>

2162
01:29:45.150 --> 01:29:47.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like the Democrats did more</v>

2163
01:29:47.221 --> 01:29:50.010
<v Speaker 3>horrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely aiming caught on something.</v>

2164
01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:53.340
<v Speaker 3>They definitely did something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just what they did to Bernie Sanders</v>

2165
01:29:53.341 --> 01:29:58.290
<v Speaker 3>alone should be a devastating blow to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the credibility of the DNC.</v>

2166
01:29:58.291 --> 01:29:59.280
<v Speaker 3>It really should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2167
01:29:59.610 --> 01:30:01.470
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2168
01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:04.860
<v Speaker 3>it's just blind allegiance and that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>could say,</v>

2169
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:07.110
<v Speaker 3>I hope for a recession.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he said that without thinking,</v>

2170
01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:09.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was just a flipping remark or,</v>

2171
01:30:09.031 --> 01:30:10.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it was a,</v>

2172
01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:13.110
<v Speaker 3>it was a package line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never hope for a recession,</v>

2173
01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:15.720
<v Speaker 3>no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would hope the guy does fantastic.</v>

2174
01:30:15.930 --> 01:30:19.350
<v Speaker 3>Even if he's hated across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope he does an amazing job.</v>

2175
01:30:19.351 --> 01:30:22.290
<v Speaker 3>And I hope the economy sores and I hope</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have more jobs,</v>

2176
01:30:22.291 --> 01:30:24.300
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope there's a method to his madness.</v>

2177
01:30:24.301 --> 01:30:26.640
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would anybody hope differently?</v>

2178
01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:27.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2179
01:30:27.601 --> 01:30:30.150
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that and basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

2180
01:30:30.151 --> 01:30:31.620
<v Speaker 3>I voted for Gary Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2181
01:30:31.621 --> 01:30:33.750
<v Speaker 3>if I had my choice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure you know me well enough.</v>

2182
01:30:33.751 --> 01:30:38.040
<v Speaker 3>Like I would much rather have like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>really bright intellectual person who</v>

2183
01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:40.060
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather have randon I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2184
01:30:40.090 --> 01:30:42.480
<v Speaker 3>I'd much rather have rand Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather have a libertarian who</v>

2185
01:30:42.481 --> 01:30:44.580
<v Speaker 3>basically is kicking everything back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the states.</v>

2186
01:30:44.581 --> 01:30:46.530
<v Speaker 3>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump is cutting a ton of regulation and</v>

2187
01:30:46.531 --> 01:30:49.350
<v Speaker 3>doing a lot of states rights stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The economy's doing really well.</v>

2188
01:30:49.530 --> 01:30:52.350
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any sense that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get into something tractable war in</v>

2189
01:30:52.351 --> 01:30:55.530
<v Speaker 3>the Middle East to nation build?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think under his watch there may</v>

2190
01:30:55.531 --> 01:30:59.880
<v Speaker 3>be some level of some peace now in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korean Peninsula.</v>

2191
01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.500
<v Speaker 3>So it's like thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2192
01:31:01.570 --> 01:31:03.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody else would have</v>
<v Speaker 3>done what he did with North Korea.</v>

2193
01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:05.970
<v Speaker 3>So talked to a bunch of shit to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

2194
01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:08.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to call him fat short.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2195
01:31:08.371 --> 01:31:12.180
<v Speaker 3>like it was very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what he does is kind of funny and</v>

2196
01:31:12.181 --> 01:31:15.900
<v Speaker 3>then he gets to have a meeting with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy and the guy agrees to a meeting with</v>

2197
01:31:15.901 --> 01:31:17.340
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're baffled by him.</v>

2198
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:20.040
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what to do with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korea and South Korea,</v>

2199
01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:25.041
<v Speaker 3>when the presidents of the two countries</v>
<v Speaker 3>met at the DMZ and shook hands like that</v>

2200
01:31:25.141 --> 01:31:27.930
<v Speaker 3>was an historic moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe they can get past all this</v>

2201
01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:29.940
<v Speaker 3>fucking bullshit that's been going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

2202
01:31:29.941 --> 01:31:34.470
<v Speaker 3>And if part of that was helped in some</v>
<v Speaker 3>way by trump being crazy,</v>

2203
01:31:34.710 --> 01:31:38.040
<v Speaker 3>like maybe it's good to have someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fucks things up a little bit and</v>

2204
01:31:38.041 --> 01:31:40.260
<v Speaker 3>mixes it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean he's a perfect person.</v>

2205
01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:45.210
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean he's not a liar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing conservative neocon Joe</v>

2206
01:31:45.210 --> 01:31:46.470
<v Speaker 3>Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Nigga about it.</v>

2207
01:31:46.471 --> 01:31:47.580
<v Speaker 3>So they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does he do?</v>

2208
01:31:47.581 --> 01:31:50.000
<v Speaker 3>So he brings in John Bolton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's thought of as a neo-con,</v>

2209
01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:53.520
<v Speaker 3>like a warmonger Neil Kahn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he has madison as the secretary</v>

2210
01:31:53.521 --> 01:31:56.700
<v Speaker 3>of defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Warmonger neo-con maybe what he was</v>

2211
01:31:56.701 --> 01:31:59.470
<v Speaker 3>doing is that he was scaring people from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the get go.</v>

2212
01:31:59.471 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 3>And I'm going to bring</v>

2213
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:01.900
<v Speaker 2>in all these people who are really</v>
<v Speaker 2>scary,</v>

2214
01:32:01.901 --> 01:32:04.330
<v Speaker 2>who don't talk about peace that often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't,</v>

2215
01:32:04.331 --> 01:32:09.331
<v Speaker 2>who talk about exercising our power and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that stuff so that Kim Jong Un is</v>

2216
01:32:09.671 --> 01:32:12.730
<v Speaker 2>going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm maybe this time they are actually</v>

2217
01:32:12.731 --> 01:32:14.970
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might actually depose me cause I</v>

2218
01:32:14.971 --> 01:32:15.481
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2219
01:32:15.481 --> 01:32:17.340
<v Speaker 2>he's looking at the trump is like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's fucking crazy.</v>

2220
01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:19.270
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where I would say my,</v>

2221
01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:21.790
<v Speaker 2>my side in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the libertarian side is pretty weak on</v>

2222
01:32:21.791 --> 01:32:24.190
<v Speaker 2>this cause a guy like ran Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he would say is,</v>

2223
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:26.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should be cutting all military and</v>

2224
01:32:26.021 --> 01:32:29.170
<v Speaker 2>never doing anything about law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which case you can make a strong</v>

2225
01:32:29.171 --> 01:32:31.750
<v Speaker 2>argument that you're constantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>emboldening your enemies all the time</v>

2226
01:32:31.930 --> 01:32:34.660
<v Speaker 2>because if they know you never want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do anything,</v>

2227
01:32:34.930 --> 01:32:38.380
<v Speaker 2>then it's not a great argument to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad actors to stop doing things.</v>

2228
01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:40.050
<v Speaker 2>But I think that's a great place to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2229
01:32:40.051 --> 01:32:42.540
<v Speaker 2>a good conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Rand Paul is supported a lot of this</v>

2230
01:32:42.541 --> 01:32:45.100
<v Speaker 2>stuff trump has done at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2231
01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna just,</v>

2232
01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:50.140
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand the logic behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting a recession when I can</v>

2233
01:32:50.141 --> 01:32:53.500
<v Speaker 2>understand the logic around wanting</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else to take over in two years</v>

2234
01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:55.570
<v Speaker 2>or three years when the new elections</v>
<v Speaker 2>take place.</v>

2235
01:32:55.571 --> 01:32:57.670
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't you think things are basically</v>

2236
01:32:57.671 --> 01:33:00.850
<v Speaker 2>going pretty well right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you remove the twitter hysteria,</v>

2237
01:33:00.851 --> 01:33:03.250
<v Speaker 2>like remove just like hysteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like this.</v>

2238
01:33:03.251 --> 01:33:05.290
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said like in terms of what's</v>

2239
01:33:05.291 --> 01:33:08.200
<v Speaker 2>happening in the country right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black and Latino unemployment all time</v>

2240
01:33:08.201 --> 01:33:11.130
<v Speaker 2>low economies chugging along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2241
01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:16.200
<v Speaker 2>like the basic things that matter for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>society are working.</v>

2242
01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.740
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2243
01:33:19.741 --> 01:33:21.700
<v Speaker 2>It's now really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about this,</v>

2244
01:33:21.701 --> 01:33:26.290
<v Speaker 2>but what I've understood what I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's been explained to me is that a</v>

2245
01:33:26.291 --> 01:33:30.760
<v Speaker 2>lot of this is the momentum of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama did when he was in office and that</v>

2246
01:33:30.761 --> 01:33:33.700
<v Speaker 2>the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's riding the work of Obama,</v>

2247
01:33:33.701 --> 01:33:37.630
<v Speaker 2>there's riding the wave of the previous</v>
<v Speaker 2>administration's policies.</v>

2248
01:33:37.630 --> 01:33:38.463
<v Speaker 2>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2249
01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:41.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a economists on my show argued</v>

2250
01:33:41.530 --> 01:33:44.830
<v Speaker 2>kind of both sides of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most don't agree with that,</v>

2251
01:33:44.831 --> 01:33:47.980
<v Speaker 2>but I've had probably more libertarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaning economist in general.</v>

2252
01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Well because they're all about cutting</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation all the time and trump has</v>

2253
01:33:50.801 --> 01:33:52.570
<v Speaker 2>been very good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's something like,</v>

2254
01:33:52.571 --> 01:33:55.550
<v Speaker 2>at one point it was like for every 63</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2255
01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:59.320
<v Speaker 2>or for every one regulation he passed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he cuts something like 63 regulations.</v>

2256
01:33:59.470 --> 01:34:02.650
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a libertarian economic</v>
<v Speaker 2>economist or someone on the right</v>

2257
01:34:03.010 --> 01:34:05.740
<v Speaker 2>economically you want the government out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all of that stuff.</v>

2258
01:34:05.741 --> 01:34:09.370
<v Speaker 2>So they're very happy at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the economic level right now.</v>

2259
01:34:10.110 --> 01:34:11.920
<v Speaker 2>But all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But let's even say that's completely</v>

2260
01:34:11.921 --> 01:34:15.160
<v Speaker 2>true what you just said there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is all just because of Obama</v>

2261
01:34:15.161 --> 01:34:16.270
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2262
01:34:16.271 --> 01:34:18.790
<v Speaker 2>it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we've got a guy that maybe has just</v>

2263
01:34:18.791 --> 01:34:22.780
<v Speaker 2>picked up the ball and he's the lucky</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and maybe he's going to get it to</v>

2264
01:34:22.781 --> 01:34:23.230
<v Speaker 2>the next thing.</v>

2265
01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:27.340
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm actually more enthused by</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I think after all this craziness</v>

2266
01:34:27.341 --> 01:34:31.210
<v Speaker 2>that we're in right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think people are so starved</v>

2267
01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:36.240
<v Speaker 2>for sanity and like a reset to decency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think things are going to get</v>

2268
01:34:36.581 --> 01:34:37.690
<v Speaker 2>much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think again,</v>

2269
01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:40.570
<v Speaker 2>this is where I think the conversations</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're all having or are affecting</v>

2270
01:34:40.571 --> 01:34:44.380
<v Speaker 2>things in a big way and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>even politically it's going to start</v>

2271
01:34:44.381 --> 01:34:47.050
<v Speaker 2>bubbling up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I when I was in DC the other day,</v>

2272
01:34:47.051 --> 01:34:51.070
<v Speaker 2>I was at a small dinner with a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>influential senator who probably doesn't</v>

2273
01:34:51.071 --> 01:34:54.520
<v Speaker 2>want me to say his name is not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say it but I'll tell it to you later.</v>

2274
01:34:54.521 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 2>But on the river somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was somebody big and he got it.</v>

2275
01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:01.040
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really got it like he knew about us</v>

2276
01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:04.250
<v Speaker 2>like this whole thing and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying like I'm not sitting here</v>

2277
01:35:04.251 --> 01:35:04.851
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2278
01:35:04.851 --> 01:35:05.840
<v Speaker 2>it's so amazing what we're doing.</v>

2279
01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:09.290
<v Speaker 2>But there something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is something happening and I think</v>

2280
01:35:09.291 --> 01:35:13.610
<v Speaker 2>it will reach the political level too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people will not want the hysteria</v>

2281
01:35:13.611 --> 01:35:17.210
<v Speaker 2>anymore and that eventually trump will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of his own craziness,</v>

2282
01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:20.630
<v Speaker 2>become unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't always need the icebreaker.</v>

2283
01:35:20.631 --> 01:35:23.630
<v Speaker 2>We needed the icebreaker to get all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit out.</v>

2284
01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Now it's all out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's reevaluating everything and</v>

2285
01:35:26.811 --> 01:35:29.300
<v Speaker 2>then out of that is going to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2286
01:35:29.301 --> 01:35:30.620
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it grows something horrible,</v>

2287
01:35:30.621 --> 01:35:32.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe the Hitler comes.</v>

2288
01:35:32.630 --> 01:35:34.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I obviously hope it doesn't happen,</v>

2289
01:35:34.851 --> 01:35:37.820
<v Speaker 2>but what I think is that something</v>
<v Speaker 2>decent is going to come that that's</v>

2290
01:35:37.821 --> 01:35:38.830
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just her.</v>

2291
01:35:40.290 --> 01:35:42.600
<v Speaker 5>Something decent is going to come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there is,</v>

2292
01:35:42.630 --> 01:35:44.880
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of decent that's coming</v>
<v Speaker 5>right now,</v>

2293
01:35:44.881 --> 01:35:46.890
<v Speaker 5>but I think there's some people that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>always going to resist that.</v>

2294
01:35:47.010 --> 01:35:47.491
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

2295
01:35:47.491 --> 01:35:50.820
<v Speaker 5>People that are just ideologically</v>
<v Speaker 5>driven and they can't be shaken from</v>

2296
01:35:50.850 --> 01:35:53.040
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can't be shook from that position.</v>

2297
01:35:53.041 --> 01:35:55.560
<v Speaker 5>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're hard left or they're hard ride</v>

2298
01:35:55.561 --> 01:35:58.440
<v Speaker 5>or whatever they are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have this rigid idea in their head</v>

2299
01:35:58.441 --> 01:36:01.710
<v Speaker 5>of what reality is and anything that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>contrary to that,</v>

2300
01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:05.010
<v Speaker 5>they're going to oppose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think Jordan has been one of my</v>

2301
01:36:05.011 --> 01:36:09.960
<v Speaker 5>favorite lightning rods for observation</v>
<v Speaker 5>for watching this because all the</v>

2302
01:36:09.961 --> 01:36:12.690
<v Speaker 5>disingenuous articles about him</v>
<v Speaker 5>deceptive,</v>

2303
01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:17.580
<v Speaker 5>talking about his positions and an</v>
<v Speaker 5>extremely inaccurate ways and labeling</v>

2304
01:36:17.581 --> 01:36:21.120
<v Speaker 5>him as some sort of a prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible person.</v>

2305
01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:27.020
<v Speaker 5>What those have done is solidified this</v>
<v Speaker 5>idea that there is a campaign of people</v>

2306
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:33.650
<v Speaker 5>that just are completely ideologically</v>
<v Speaker 5>driven and they don't mind being</v>

2307
01:36:33.651 --> 01:36:34.484
<v Speaker 5>deceptive.</v>

2308
01:36:34.730 --> 01:36:39.170
<v Speaker 5>And that strengthens the puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It helps people like us that just talk</v>

2309
01:36:39.171 --> 01:36:44.030
<v Speaker 5>about stuff and don't mind talking about</v>
<v Speaker 5>being incorrect or ignorant or not</v>

2310
01:36:44.110 --> 01:36:46.760
<v Speaker 5>worried.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not worried about our stance.</v>

2311
01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:47.721
<v Speaker 5>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

2312
01:36:47.721 --> 01:36:52.721
<v Speaker 5>we're going about most conversations</v>
<v Speaker 5>from a place of objectivity if it as</v>

2313
01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:56.300
<v Speaker 5>much as we possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people are subjective at least to a</v>

2314
01:36:56.301 --> 01:36:59.210
<v Speaker 5>certain extent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as much objectivity as we can,</v>

2315
01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:01.970
<v Speaker 5>as much honesty as we can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And just talking about things.</v>

2316
01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:03.680
<v Speaker 5>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2317
01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:07.790
<v Speaker 5>this is something that's not happening</v>
<v Speaker 5>in these little click baity articles or</v>

2318
01:37:07.791 --> 01:37:12.380
<v Speaker 5>in people that interrupt your shows and</v>
<v Speaker 5>shake fucking jars and Nicole's or</v>

2319
01:37:12.381 --> 01:37:14.990
<v Speaker 5>whatever they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's that,</v>

2320
01:37:14.991 --> 01:37:18.510
<v Speaker 5>all that stuff's strengthens this</v>
<v Speaker 5>position that we're in,</v>

2321
01:37:18.511 --> 01:37:23.511
<v Speaker 5>that we're in this weird time of</v>
<v Speaker 5>intellectual dishonesty and turmoil.</v>

2322
01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:27.780
<v Speaker 5>And I think a lot of it is because</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people that were just</v>

2323
01:37:27.781 --> 01:37:31.110
<v Speaker 5>extremely upset that trump got into</v>
<v Speaker 5>office and anything that seems to</v>

2324
01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:34.560
<v Speaker 5>represent that position or that side</v>
<v Speaker 5>must be opposed violence.</v>

2325
01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:36.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think underneath everything you're</v>

2326
01:37:36.701 --> 01:37:37.630
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right there,</v>

2327
01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:40.690
<v Speaker 2>you're very hopeful right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually sense that you're really</v>

2328
01:37:40.691 --> 01:37:41.830
<v Speaker 2>hopeful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I am too.</v>

2329
01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:43.690
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could we ever do this if we weren't</v>

2330
01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:44.121
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

2331
01:37:44.121 --> 01:37:47.530
<v Speaker 2>I would say that I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had to like sort of widdle it down</v>

2332
01:37:47.531 --> 01:37:48.940
<v Speaker 2>what I am at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the core,</v>

2333
01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:51.600
<v Speaker 2>I basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a world weary optimist.</v>

2334
01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm an optimist by nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I believe that the world,</v>

2335
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:58.500
<v Speaker 2>the world is rough and tumble and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that Jordan would say about</v>

2336
01:37:58.501 --> 01:37:59.970
<v Speaker 2>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

2337
01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:03.990
<v Speaker 2>But I'm still an optimist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despite that and what you just said,</v>

2338
01:38:03.991 --> 01:38:08.880
<v Speaker 2>right there basically is showing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trump thing was necessary because</v>

2339
01:38:08.881 --> 01:38:12.560
<v Speaker 2>imagine if hillary was president right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now in the same machine and bullshit and</v>

2340
01:38:12.561 --> 01:38:15.840
<v Speaker 2>nonsense and media and all of that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept churning along.</v>

2341
01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Think how much worse it would be for</v>
<v Speaker 2>these conversations right now we would</v>

2342
01:38:19.201 --> 01:38:22.380
<v Speaker 2>so beyond the wrongs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the wrong side of things so to</v>

2343
01:38:22.381 --> 01:38:25.560
<v Speaker 2>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the forces that don't want us to do</v>

2344
01:38:25.561 --> 01:38:28.710
<v Speaker 2>anything good and have conversations</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have been so emboldened.</v>

2345
01:38:28.711 --> 01:38:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Trump just came and took a freaking bat</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the whole thing.</v>

2346
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I discussed with Eric Weinstein,</v>

2347
01:38:33.570 --> 01:38:35.430
<v Speaker 2>it's like trump was the bull in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>China shop.</v>

2348
01:38:35.431 --> 01:38:37.590
<v Speaker 2>I think most of us would have preferred</v>
<v Speaker 2>a panther wait,</v>

2349
01:38:37.591 --> 01:38:39.270
<v Speaker 2>like we kind of wanted something to walk</v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

2350
01:38:39.271 --> 01:38:41.850
<v Speaker 2>knock a few things off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump just blew up the whole thing.</v>

2351
01:38:41.851 --> 01:38:43.740
<v Speaker 2>You don't the phrases bull in a China</v>
<v Speaker 2>shop,</v>

2352
01:38:43.741 --> 01:38:45.380
<v Speaker 2>not a panther in a China shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2353
01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:48.300
<v Speaker 2>So that's what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But after this,</v>

2354
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:53.870
<v Speaker 2>for every reason you just said there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a return to sanity.</v>

2355
01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:55.950
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes one of two ways,</v>

2356
01:38:55.951 --> 01:38:57.960
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just am a firm believer that it will</v>

2357
01:38:57.961 --> 01:39:00.240
<v Speaker 2>go that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is enough of us out there now</v>

2358
01:39:00.241 --> 01:39:03.630
<v Speaker 2>trying to reset things and because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think people are evil.</v>

2359
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:05.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people want to be talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>down to.</v>

2360
01:39:05.431 --> 01:39:08.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people are dumb and even</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are dumb,</v>

2361
01:39:08.371 --> 01:39:11.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they want to be dumb and</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of all of that,</v>

2362
01:39:12.570 --> 01:39:15.150
<v Speaker 2>I think this was the necessary thing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen right now.</v>

2363
01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:19.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that he continues to do basically</v>

2364
01:39:19.141 --> 01:39:23.010
<v Speaker 2>good things and that if that means that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets in for another four years and</v>

2365
01:39:23.011 --> 01:39:24.840
<v Speaker 2>continues to do good things then so be</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2366
01:39:24.841 --> 01:39:28.110
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would I prefer that it's sort of more of</v>

2367
01:39:28.111 --> 01:39:31.770
<v Speaker 2>a small government calm person who could</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you how many branches of government</v>

2368
01:39:31.771 --> 01:39:36.270
<v Speaker 2>there are and like all of that shit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the stuff from that flag that's</v>

2369
01:39:36.271 --> 01:39:37.470
<v Speaker 2>right behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2370
01:39:37.650 --> 01:39:40.590
<v Speaker 2>I've got a freaking declaration of</v>
<v Speaker 2>independence in our control room and a</v>

2371
01:39:40.591 --> 01:39:42.690
<v Speaker 2>constitution and a big American flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2372
01:39:42.691 --> 01:39:46.380
<v Speaker 2>would I rather someone who knew what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>federalist papers are and all of those</v>

2373
01:39:46.381 --> 01:39:48.510
<v Speaker 2>things be in the Oval Office?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2374
01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:51.210
<v Speaker 2>You don't get everything you want in</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

2375
01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:53.910
<v Speaker 2>so you just kind of work with what comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we can,</v>

2376
01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:56.120
<v Speaker 2>we have a little room to work right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

2377
01:39:56.180 --> 01:40:01.180
<v Speaker 5>also as more people open themselves up</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the ideas that Jordan is espousing or</v>

2378
01:40:02.031 --> 01:40:06.290
<v Speaker 5>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am or more people are genuinely</v>

2379
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:09.050
<v Speaker 5>objective about these ideas and start</v>
<v Speaker 5>discussing them.</v>

2380
01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:14.010
<v Speaker 5>The more frantic the people on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>radical left in the the,</v>

2381
01:40:14.190 --> 01:40:16.070
<v Speaker 5>what would they call the regressive</v>
<v Speaker 5>left,</v>

2382
01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:19.470
<v Speaker 5>the more ridiculous they're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the more obvious it's going to get</v>

2383
01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:21.470
<v Speaker 5>that they're out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just what happens.</v>

2384
01:40:21.471 --> 01:40:24.480
<v Speaker 5>People Start Ranting and screaming</v>
<v Speaker 5>louder because the,</v>

2385
01:40:24.481 --> 01:40:26.960
<v Speaker 5>their initial meshes doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like they're going to go back</v>

2386
01:40:26.961 --> 01:40:29.510
<v Speaker 5>and revamp the message and make it more</v>
<v Speaker 5>logical.</v>

2387
01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:32.540
<v Speaker 5>There's no logical message there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but think about that.</v>

2388
01:40:32.541 --> 01:40:34.970
<v Speaker 5>So when that's exactly what they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing with trump too.</v>

2389
01:40:34.971 --> 01:40:36.740
<v Speaker 5>You keep screaming trump's Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2390
01:40:36.741 --> 01:40:38.300
<v Speaker 5>He keeps screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump's Hitler,</v>

2391
01:40:38.301 --> 01:40:39.060
<v Speaker 5>Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hitler.</v>

2392
01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:41.010
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler killed millions and millions of</v>

2393
01:40:41.011 --> 01:40:43.620
<v Speaker 2>people in many more millions were killed</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of Hitler that he didn't</v>

2394
01:40:43.621 --> 01:40:45.120
<v Speaker 2>directly kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2395
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:49.020
<v Speaker 2>if you keep doing that with trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then someone plays that Barack Obama</v>

2396
01:40:49.021 --> 01:40:50.740
<v Speaker 2>clip and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2397
01:40:50.741 --> 01:40:51.011
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

2398
01:40:51.011 --> 01:40:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're calling trump Hitler.</v>

2399
01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Here's Obama saying something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually sounds possibly even more</v>

2400
01:40:56.291 --> 01:40:58.300
<v Speaker 2>extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you believe this is an extreme</v>

2401
01:40:58.301 --> 01:41:00.070
<v Speaker 2>position to take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now is,</v>

2402
01:41:00.130 --> 01:41:02.920
<v Speaker 2>is Obama Hiller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they're doing is they're</v>

2403
01:41:02.921 --> 01:41:07.330
<v Speaker 2>creating a situation where they're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cause a rebound so that people will</v>

2404
01:41:07.331 --> 01:41:08.164
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2405
01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:10.930
<v Speaker 2>these guys aren't all nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they,</v>

2406
01:41:11.290 --> 01:41:14.170
<v Speaker 2>if they destroy all of our ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have this conversation,</v>

2407
01:41:14.590 --> 01:41:17.560
<v Speaker 2>then when the real Hitler comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we won't even be able to recognize it</v>

2408
01:41:17.561 --> 01:41:20.860
<v Speaker 2>because they will have cried wolf to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>point that someone's going to come in</v>

2409
01:41:20.861 --> 01:41:23.920
<v Speaker 2>and they're gonna have a big smile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It won't be a trump win when Hitler,</v>

2410
01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.140
<v Speaker 2>the Hitler type,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hate using Hitler as the,</v>

2411
01:41:26.141 --> 01:41:27.820
<v Speaker 2>as the metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it's so overplayed.</v>

2412
01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:32.820
<v Speaker 2>But like when the Hitler type comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it ain't come in as the angry guy like</v>

2413
01:41:33.551 --> 01:41:35.680
<v Speaker 2>trump is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to come with a smile on its</v>

2414
01:41:35.681 --> 01:41:36.161
<v Speaker 2>face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2415
01:41:36.161 --> 01:41:37.930
<v Speaker 2>That's that socialist tee shirt like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2416
01:41:37.931 --> 01:41:39.160
<v Speaker 2>socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smiley face.</v>

2417
01:41:39.370 --> 01:41:43.030
<v Speaker 2>That's how it will come because it will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be masked in identity politics.</v>

2418
01:41:43.031 --> 01:41:46.690
<v Speaker 2>It will be masked in all of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense that will rip us apart.</v>

2419
01:41:46.691 --> 01:41:48.850
<v Speaker 2>That will literally have us killing each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other on the streets.</v>

2420
01:41:49.010 --> 01:41:52.840
<v Speaker 2>What do you think would cause a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what scenario do you foresee?</v>

2421
01:41:52.841 --> 01:41:57.841
<v Speaker 2>There could be possibly if the extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideas of what I consider the fringe</v>

2422
01:41:58.691 --> 01:42:01.060
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are pretty much mainstream</v>

2423
01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Democrat ideas already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the Democrats keep going more towards</v>

2424
01:42:04.301 --> 01:42:05.500
<v Speaker 2>the Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elizabeth Warren,</v>

2425
01:42:05.501 --> 01:42:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Keith Ellison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real hard left progressive stuff.</v>

2426
01:42:09.710 --> 01:42:12.340
<v Speaker 2>It is rooted in identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>

2427
01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:15.760
<v Speaker 2>you know we've done already but like it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is rooted in something that separates</v>

2428
01:42:15.761 --> 01:42:16.030
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

2429
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:18.310
<v Speaker 2>It is rooted that you should that even</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

2430
01:42:18.311 --> 01:42:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Did you see this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Harvard,</v>

2431
01:42:19.391 --> 01:42:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I just tweeted out when I was on the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

2432
01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Harvard released this statement of</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending the fact that they are okay</v>

2433
01:42:24.881 --> 01:42:29.230
<v Speaker 2>with basically having quotas that work</v>
<v Speaker 2>against Asian students because they want</v>

2434
01:42:29.231 --> 01:42:34.231
<v Speaker 2>to have more other minorities basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning black or Hispanic minorities.</v>

2435
01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:38.080
<v Speaker 2>So think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you discriminate if you are</v>

2436
01:42:38.081 --> 01:42:39.910
<v Speaker 2>hiring right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're hiring today,</v>

2437
01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:42.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're hiring for your studio,</v>

2438
01:42:42.730 --> 01:42:44.800
<v Speaker 2>you can hire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can hire the most qualified person.</v>

2439
01:42:44.801 --> 01:42:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to try to figure out every</v>
<v Speaker 2>little identity thing to figure out who</v>

2440
01:42:47.921 --> 01:42:49.150
<v Speaker 2>you should hire?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diversity,</v>

2441
01:42:49.151 --> 01:42:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all about diversity.</v>

2442
01:42:51.490 --> 01:42:52.540
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd hire,</v>

2443
01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:56.740
<v Speaker 2>it's racist against Asians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just haven't been very vocal about it</v>

2444
01:42:56.741 --> 01:42:59.620
<v Speaker 2>cause they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to just put their fucking nose</v>

2445
01:42:59.621 --> 01:43:02.800
<v Speaker 2>to the grindstone and keep ticking out</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have to use that against them.</v>

2446
01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:04.720
<v Speaker 2>Now that works so that that's the new</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2447
01:43:04.721 --> 01:43:06.610
<v Speaker 2>You will not be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're Asian and you,</v>

2448
01:43:06.611 --> 01:43:09.250
<v Speaker 2>and why did they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did Asian Americans are Indian</v>

2449
01:43:09.250 --> 01:43:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Americans are a great example that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have succeeded at every level that we</v>

2450
01:43:12.521 --> 01:43:15.010
<v Speaker 2>measure success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the highest socioeconomic</v>

2451
01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.980
<v Speaker 2>average salary over a hundred grand and</v>
<v Speaker 2>no education,</v>

2452
01:43:17.981 --> 01:43:18.814
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

2453
01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:20.650
<v Speaker 2>If you now say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well wait a minute,</v>

2454
01:43:20.651 --> 01:43:23.470
<v Speaker 2>these people played by the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they came here as it most,</v>

2455
01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:23.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2456
01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:27.400
<v Speaker 2>like all of our ancestors virtually came</v>
<v Speaker 2>here pretty much with nothing.</v>

2457
01:43:27.401 --> 01:43:29.590
<v Speaker 2>People on small businesses busted their</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass,</v>

2458
01:43:29.591 --> 01:43:32.200
<v Speaker 2>worked in coal mines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's said wherever you had to do it,</v>

2459
01:43:32.530 --> 01:43:36.430
<v Speaker 2>if you do all of those things and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you focus on education and on family and</v>

2460
01:43:36.431 --> 01:43:38.890
<v Speaker 2>all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now the system is going to say,</v>

2461
01:43:38.891 --> 01:43:42.160
<v Speaker 2>well it worked for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to have to put you at</v>

2462
01:43:42.161 --> 01:43:43.330
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the thing now.</v>

2463
01:43:43.330 --> 01:43:44.860
<v Speaker 2>And you guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get into Harvard</v>

2464
01:43:44.861 --> 01:43:47.800
<v Speaker 2>because you're Asian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is racism.</v>

2465
01:43:47.801 --> 01:43:51.830
<v Speaker 2>So I've been calling this out for at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least two years that the next move by</v>

2466
01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:56.120
<v Speaker 2>this identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this evil oppression Olympics machine is</v>

2467
01:43:56.121 --> 01:43:58.970
<v Speaker 2>that they will come after Asian people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's starting to happen now.</v>

2468
01:43:59.090 --> 01:44:01.040
<v Speaker 2>So I see all these minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

2469
01:44:01.041 --> 01:44:02.390
<v Speaker 2>So candace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

2470
01:44:02.391 --> 01:44:05.210
<v Speaker 2>I watched the show and I know you guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely have disagreements on stuff</v>

2471
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:08.510
<v Speaker 2>as do I do when it comes not only to</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics but tactics sometimes and</v>

2472
01:44:08.511 --> 01:44:09.770
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really do like her.</v>

2473
01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2474
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:13.550
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's causing a massive rift in the</v>

2475
01:44:13.551 --> 01:44:15.410
<v Speaker 2>black community and you can see it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers.</v>

2476
01:44:15.411 --> 01:44:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Black male support for trump or for</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump?</v>

2477
01:44:17.991 --> 01:44:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Doubled it was at 11% it's 22 no one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2478
01:44:21.621 --> 01:44:23.780
<v Speaker 2>it's Kanye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kanye was the wrecking machine,</v>

2479
01:44:23.781 --> 01:44:26.090
<v Speaker 2>but I actually think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in the grand scheme of things</v>

2480
01:44:26.091 --> 01:44:27.530
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>candace is much bigger.</v>

2481
01:44:27.650 --> 01:44:31.820
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think she could be a direct</v>

2482
01:44:31.821 --> 01:44:35.840
<v Speaker 2>line to all of the political parts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this if she decides to go that route</v>

2483
01:44:35.841 --> 01:44:39.200
<v Speaker 2>because I think she could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she could run for Senate or,</v>

2484
01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:40.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2485
01:44:41.130 --> 01:44:41.963
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

2486
01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:45.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm not high today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

2487

<v Speaker 2>Sundays and now and now I'm on tour so</v>

2488

<v Speaker 2>I'm not really at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let us park up at joint and have you</v>

2489
01:44:50.691 --> 01:44:54.080
<v Speaker 2>reconsidered what you just said?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can smoke a joint and maybe I'll</v>

2490
01:44:54.081 --> 01:44:56.060
<v Speaker 2>reconsider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said you watched the podcast I did with</v>

01:44:57.690 --> 01:44:59.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe at least at least an hour and a</v>

2494
01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:00.310
<v Speaker 2>half of it or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2495
01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2496
01:45:02.050 --> 01:45:05.420
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why you saying it that way</v>

2497
01:45:05.450 --> 01:45:06.980
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think she should run for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Senate.</v>

2498
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:07.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2499
01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:11.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a young girl with some interesting ideas</v>

2500
01:45:11.361 --> 01:45:12.390
<v Speaker 2>and she's got a lot of passion.</v>

2501
01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:13.233
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say,</v>

2502
01:45:13.730 --> 01:45:15.950
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say you think she should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I even say I think she's here.</v>

2503
01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:19.760
<v Speaker 2>I think she could have a bigger effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even then Kanye,</v>

2504
01:45:19.761 --> 01:45:22.120
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to just everything going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on politically,</v>

2505
01:45:22.121 --> 01:45:23.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to ask you again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl,</v>

2506
01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:26.240
<v Speaker 2>she wants it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wants it,</v>

2507
01:45:26.241 --> 01:45:27.350
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure she does,</v>

2508
01:45:27.351 --> 01:45:29.570
<v Speaker 2>but when you share affecting people in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big way,</v>

2509
01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:33.430
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe in a bigger way than then</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps either one of us don't</v>

2510
01:45:33.431 --> 01:45:35.950
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my butt forgetting candace</v>

2511
01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:37.820
<v Speaker 2>specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point.</v>

2512
01:45:37.821 --> 01:45:40.100
<v Speaker 2>My point was nice person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2513
01:45:40.130 --> 01:45:44.030
<v Speaker 2>My point was though that I think all</v>
<v Speaker 2>minority groups are reevaluating what's</v>

2514
01:45:44.031 --> 01:45:45.530
<v Speaker 2>going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're in the black community,</v>

2515
01:45:45.531 --> 01:45:49.130
<v Speaker 2>clearly there is at the moment a</v>
<v Speaker 2>reevaluation of do we have to be</v>

2516
01:45:49.131 --> 01:45:50.800
<v Speaker 2>democratic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

2517
01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:52.070
<v Speaker 2>that is an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2518
01:45:52.190 --> 01:45:53.570
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a racist issue.</v>

2519
01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because people assume that if you're</v>

2520
01:45:55.551 --> 01:45:57.230
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must be a democrat.</v>

2521
01:45:57.230 --> 01:45:58.820
<v Speaker 2>If you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're some sort of an uncle Tom.</v>

2522
01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:00.260
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2523
01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Talk to my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry Elder,</v>

2524
01:46:01.611 --> 01:46:03.800
<v Speaker 2>I had thomas soul on the show or my</v>
<v Speaker 2>buddy David Webb,</v>

2525
01:46:03.801 --> 01:46:04.491
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or many of,</v>

2526
01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:09.050
<v Speaker 2>there are many black conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure you are allowed to think however</v>

2527
01:46:09.051 --> 01:46:10.670
<v Speaker 2>you want it despite your skin color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2528
01:46:10.671 --> 01:46:13.280
<v Speaker 2>So I think the black community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Carson,</v>

2529
01:46:13.281 --> 01:46:15.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think the black community</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to split,</v>

2530
01:46:15.591 --> 01:46:19.640
<v Speaker 2>I think the gay community starting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>split because the left has sort of had</v>

2531
01:46:19.641 --> 01:46:22.910
<v Speaker 2>this odd embracement of Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is bad for gays.</v>

2532
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.530
<v Speaker 2>So I think the gays are starting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>split.</v>

2533
01:46:24.531 --> 01:46:26.120
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2534
01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Latinos are even starting to split a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit differently because I think</v>

2535
01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:31.160
<v Speaker 2>for all the people that came here</v>
<v Speaker 2>legally,</v>

2536
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:34.460
<v Speaker 2>they're actually not as thrilled with</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal immigration as the media may</v>

2537
01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:37.910
<v Speaker 2>imply that they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's just massive shifts</v>

2538
01:46:37.911 --> 01:46:42.320
<v Speaker 2>happening all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way we look at voting where</v>

2539
01:46:42.321 --> 01:46:43.790
<v Speaker 2>every election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2540
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:46.220
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>John King goes on CNN and shows you the</v>

2541
01:46:46.221 --> 01:46:47.240
<v Speaker 2>map and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2542
01:46:47.241 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 2>the white working class people here</v>
<v Speaker 2>voted this way and the black inner</v>

2543
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:52.650
<v Speaker 3>city people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think all of that is about to</v>

2544
01:46:52.651 --> 01:46:56.430
<v Speaker 3>explode and they won't know what to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they haven't been listening.</v>

2545
01:46:56.431 --> 01:46:58.920
<v Speaker 3>But I think some others have them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

2546
01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:01.560
<v Speaker 3>there's real room in this country for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>third party.</v>

2547
01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:04.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for sure someone could take a</v>

2548
01:47:04.561 --> 01:47:06.960
<v Speaker 3>position that's outside those two boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2549
01:47:06.990 --> 01:47:10.650
<v Speaker 3>And and make some real valid points and</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a little bit of ideas from each</v>

2550
01:47:10.651 --> 01:47:12.810
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the real concern,</v>

2551
01:47:12.811 --> 01:47:15.450
<v Speaker 3>this country seems to be throwing your</v>
<v Speaker 3>vote away,</v>

2552
01:47:15.810 --> 01:47:17.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that people were always</v>

2553
01:47:17.221 --> 01:47:18.031
<v Speaker 3>worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2554
01:47:18.031 --> 01:47:20.100
<v Speaker 3>if you go that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're throwing your vote away and</v>

2555
01:47:20.101 --> 01:47:23.640
<v Speaker 3>you're essentially giving it to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>person that is on the other side.</v>

2556
01:47:24.090 --> 01:47:25.950
<v Speaker 3>I used to kind of buy into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2557
01:47:25.951 --> 01:47:29.070
<v Speaker 3>Cause realistically within,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is why I was so disappointed in</v>

2558
01:47:29.071 --> 01:47:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Gary Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every half the country hated hillary,</v>

2559
01:47:31.711 --> 01:47:34.740
<v Speaker 3>half the country hated trump at at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>highest levels that you could hate a</v>

2560
01:47:34.741 --> 01:47:35.190
<v Speaker 3>candidate.</v>

2561
01:47:35.190 --> 01:47:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if there was ever a time for just a</v>

2562
01:47:37.411 --> 01:47:38.890
<v Speaker 3>decent guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2563
01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:40.770
<v Speaker 3>Like Gary Johnson's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a decent guy.</v>

2564
01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:43.170
<v Speaker 3>If he was here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he'd probably want to spark up and</v>

2565
01:47:43.171 --> 01:47:44.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a nice guy,</v>

2566
01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:47.310
<v Speaker 3>he's just a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was such an ineffective,</v>

2567
01:47:47.670 --> 01:47:52.500
<v Speaker 3>confused memory problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't lay out his basic principles</v>

2568
01:47:52.501 --> 01:47:53.370
<v Speaker 3>simply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2569
01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:56.460
<v Speaker 3>he wanted as a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted the baker to bake the cake.</v>

2570
01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:59.370
<v Speaker 3>That that's a crazy position to hold as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a libertarian.</v>

2571
01:47:59.550 --> 01:48:01.500
<v Speaker 3>Makes no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's completely against.</v>

2572
01:48:01.710 --> 01:48:03.670
<v Speaker 3>What would be your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2573
01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.480
<v Speaker 3>line of thinking as a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would never want the government to</v>

2574
01:48:06.481 --> 01:48:11.280
<v Speaker 3>force someone to do a specific task.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking about the gay couple that wanted</v>

2575
01:48:11.281 --> 01:48:12.360
<v Speaker 3>a wedding cake made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2576
01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your position on that,</v>

2577
01:48:14.311 --> 01:48:15.750
<v Speaker 3>by the way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2578
01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:19.470
<v Speaker 3>well there's two issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One issue is that this,</v>

2579
01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:24.740
<v Speaker 3>they apparently went to places they</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought would deny them so that they can</v>

2580
01:48:24.841 --> 01:48:25.890
<v Speaker 3>make a story out of it.</v>

2581
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:28.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't as simple as a loving couple</v>

2582
01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:32.310
<v Speaker 3>went to someplace they wanted to get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cake made and the people said no.</v>

2583
01:48:32.311 --> 01:48:33.450
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

2584
01:48:33.810 --> 01:48:38.160
<v Speaker 3>Now they wanted a story and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they sought out places that they</v>

2585
01:48:38.161 --> 01:48:41.850
<v Speaker 3>thought were going to deny them and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they made a giant national event out of</v>

2586
01:48:41.851 --> 01:48:45.780
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people should discriminate</v>

2587
01:48:45.781 --> 01:48:48.030
<v Speaker 3>to the point where they're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make someone a cake.</v>

2588
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:50.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's the government.</v>

2589
01:48:50.250 --> 01:48:52.710
<v Speaker 3>Do you think the government should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>government shouldn't step in?</v>

2590
01:48:52.711 --> 01:48:53.310
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2591
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:57.620
<v Speaker 3>I think you should let people know</v>
<v Speaker 3>publicly these,</v>

2592
01:48:57.630 --> 01:49:00.630
<v Speaker 3>these are people that they discriminate</v>
<v Speaker 3>against gay people.</v>

2593
01:49:00.631 --> 01:49:05.631
<v Speaker 3>And so if you want your dollars to</v>
<v Speaker 3>represent your opinions and your</v>

2594
01:49:06.481 --> 01:49:08.970
<v Speaker 3>feelings on things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you shouldn't buy a cake from</v>

2595
01:49:08.971 --> 01:49:11.400
<v Speaker 3>these folks that don't want to make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cake for gay people.</v>

2596
01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:14.040
<v Speaker 3>But the idea of the government's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to step in.</v>

2597
01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:17.790
<v Speaker 3>It seems crazy to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then as soon as I say that,</v>

2598
01:49:17.791 --> 01:49:18.510
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2599
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:20.760
<v Speaker 3>well what if they wouldn't make a cake</v>
<v Speaker 3>for black people?</v>

2600
01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Should the government step in then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2601
01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:24.120
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's a couple of things,</v>

2602
01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:25.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a couple of things there.</v>

2603
01:49:25.321 --> 01:49:28.500
<v Speaker 3>So first off it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was about the specifics of the cake.</v>

2604
01:49:28.501 --> 01:49:30.900
<v Speaker 3>I know this guy had a lot of people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get into the nitty gritty of</v>

2605
01:49:30.901 --> 01:49:33.750
<v Speaker 3>every legal part of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was about a specific,</v>

2606
01:49:33.751 --> 01:49:36.420
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't that he wasn't going to sell</v>
<v Speaker 3>them a cake that was on the shelf.</v>

2607
01:49:36.690 --> 01:49:37.620
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't want to make,</v>

2608
01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:40.530
<v Speaker 3>he didn't want to make them a cake for</v>
<v Speaker 3>this wedding.</v>

2609
01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:44.190
<v Speaker 3>Now that's asking him to do something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's artistic or that's not,</v>

2610
01:49:44.670 --> 01:49:48.370
<v Speaker 3>what was the variables like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want men.</v>

2611
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:52.330
<v Speaker 2>So I apparently am the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually never got to that point cause</v>

2612
01:49:52.331 --> 01:49:55.330
<v Speaker 2>he denied them before that because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew what it was going to be.</v>

2613
01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:57.010
<v Speaker 2>So it never got to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2614
01:49:57.011 --> 01:49:59.170
<v Speaker 2>are you when you're going to draw us</v>
<v Speaker 2>together or whatever.</v>

2615
01:49:59.171 --> 01:50:00.700
<v Speaker 2>But he knew it was going to be a gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>wedding.</v>

2616
01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:03.550
<v Speaker 2>So let just said no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making a cake for a gay wedding</v>

2617
01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:04.361
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look.</v>

2618
01:50:04.361 --> 01:50:06.130
<v Speaker 2>But they could have bought a cake that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was there.</v>

2619
01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:09.040
<v Speaker 2>So like it was an interracial wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you have a more of an issue with</v>

2620
01:50:09.041 --> 01:50:10.360
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2621
01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:12.190
<v Speaker 2>so here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

2622
01:50:12.610 --> 01:50:15.340
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have the civil rights act of 1964.</v>

2623
01:50:15.370 --> 01:50:18.040
<v Speaker 2>You have to serve people based on race</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2624
01:50:18.130 --> 01:50:20.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the minority statuses that there</v>

2625
01:50:20.321 --> 01:50:21.850
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not for re litigating that,</v>

2626
01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:23.050
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are,</v>

2627
01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:27.340
<v Speaker 2>there is a libertarian argument that</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically would say we don't need those</v>

2628
01:50:27.341 --> 01:50:30.880
<v Speaker 2>laws anymore because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the civil rights act was in response to</v>

2629
01:50:30.881 --> 01:50:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Jim Crow laws were states in the south</v>
<v Speaker 2>had discriminatory laws.</v>

2630
01:50:34.810 --> 01:50:37.420
<v Speaker 2>So we had the federal government come in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and clean that up for everybody.</v>

2631
01:50:37.421 --> 01:50:40.960
<v Speaker 2>So you have to serve everyone equally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't deny a black couple to come</v>

2632
01:50:40.961 --> 01:50:44.260
<v Speaker 2>into your restaurant or [inaudible] can</v>
<v Speaker 2>you walk?</v>

2633
01:50:44.261 --> 01:50:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Can you deny a gay person then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

2634
01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:48.190
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a specific thing.</v>

2635
01:50:48.250 --> 01:50:49.930
<v Speaker 2>It was a specific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let look put it,</v>

2636
01:50:50.170 --> 01:50:51.400
<v Speaker 2>put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had a,</v>

2637
01:50:51.401 --> 01:50:53.770
<v Speaker 2>if there was a Jewish artist who took</v>
<v Speaker 2>commissions,</v>

2638
01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:55.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for paintings,</v>

2639
01:50:55.570 --> 01:50:59.920
<v Speaker 2>would you force that person to bake to</v>
<v Speaker 2>paint Neo Nazi signs?</v>

2640
01:50:59.921 --> 01:51:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would never have the government come</v>

2641
01:51:02.411 --> 01:51:05.980
<v Speaker 2>in and say that they are forced to paint</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's against their</v>

2642
01:51:05.981 --> 01:51:08.650
<v Speaker 2>conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say that your original</v>

2643
01:51:08.651 --> 01:51:10.690
<v Speaker 2>position is the right one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2644
01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:12.610
<v Speaker 2>it kind of sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2645
01:51:12.611 --> 01:51:16.390
<v Speaker 2>It kind of sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish in my heart of hearts I'm gay</v>

2646
01:51:16.391 --> 01:51:16.750
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2647
01:51:16.750 --> 01:51:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I wish that every Baker would treat</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone equally and every person would</v>

2648
01:51:21.221 --> 01:51:23.440
<v Speaker 2>treat everyone equally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not allowed.</v>

2649
01:51:23.441 --> 01:51:27.550
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't allowed to deny them something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was in the store already because</v>

2650
01:51:27.551 --> 01:51:30.640
<v Speaker 2>you can't deny based on those protected</v>
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>

2651
01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:32.860
<v Speaker 2>So he wouldn't have by the Civil Rights</v>
<v Speaker 2>Act,</v>

2652
01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:37.150
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't have been allowed to deny a</v>
<v Speaker 2>interracial couple of cake that existed</v>

2653
01:51:37.151 --> 01:51:40.090
<v Speaker 2>there already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But could he have cody have denied them</v>

2654
01:51:40.091 --> 01:51:42.940
<v Speaker 2>one that he would have had to draw a</v>
<v Speaker 2>black woman and a white woman if he was</v>

2655
01:51:42.941 --> 01:51:46.690
<v Speaker 2>a real racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the answer is that he could have</v>

2656
01:51:46.691 --> 01:51:50.080
<v Speaker 2>denied them that and that would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been very shitty and he would be a</v>

2657
01:51:50.081 --> 01:51:54.520
<v Speaker 2>racist and a really awful person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if the answer is that the government</v>

2658
01:51:54.521 --> 01:51:57.010
<v Speaker 2>should then come in and tell this man</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do,</v>

2659
01:51:57.011 --> 01:51:59.920
<v Speaker 2>I would not be for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

2660
01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2661
01:52:01.511 --> 01:52:04.870
<v Speaker 2>that's just the cleanest way to deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this related to freedom.</v>

2662
01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:08.470
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like freedom is messy.</v>

2663
01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.780
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Shitty.</v>

2664
01:52:10.781 --> 01:52:12.730
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the government can't protect you</v>

2665
01:52:12.731 --> 01:52:15.220
<v Speaker 2>from shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2666
01:52:15.490 --> 01:52:18.170
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously that's why the KKK is</v>

2667
01:52:18.171 --> 01:52:19.390
<v Speaker 2>still exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2668
01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:21.040
<v Speaker 2>And what's the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2669
01:52:21.041 --> 01:52:23.080
<v Speaker 2>what's the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would all love the KKK to go away.</v>

2670
01:52:23.081 --> 01:52:24.730
<v Speaker 2>We would all love there to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all of us,</v>

2671
01:52:24.731 --> 01:52:27.400
<v Speaker 2>but most sane people don't want racism</v>
<v Speaker 2>to exist.</v>

2672
01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:30.910
<v Speaker 2>But should we not let people meet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should we be bugging people?</v>

2673
01:52:30.911 --> 01:52:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Should we force people to do something</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to do?</v>

2674
01:52:34.091 --> 01:52:34.811
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't,</v>

2675
01:52:34.811 --> 01:52:37.330
<v Speaker 2>I just fundamentally do not believe in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2676
01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't want people to be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want people to be homophobic or</v>

2677
01:52:40.331 --> 01:52:43.480
<v Speaker 2>transphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea that the government can use</v>

2678
01:52:43.481 --> 01:52:47.180
<v Speaker 2>its authority to make people do all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things I just think is absolutely</v>

2679
01:52:47.181 --> 01:52:47.990
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

2680
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:51.650
<v Speaker 2>So whether they decided to intentionally</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflame this or not by finding people</v>

2681
01:52:51.651 --> 01:52:53.420
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that weren't going to do it.</v>

2682
01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:56.690
<v Speaker 2>If you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're listening to this right now</v>

2683
01:52:56.691 --> 01:52:59.420
<v Speaker 2>and you're getting married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're getting gay,</v>

2684
01:52:59.421 --> 01:53:00.780
<v Speaker 2>married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2685
01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:03.040
<v Speaker 2>or untraditional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he married as they call it,</v>

2686
01:53:03.041 --> 01:53:05.680
<v Speaker 2>you're doing that and you live in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alabama and there's only one baker there</v>

2687
01:53:05.681 --> 01:53:08.230
<v Speaker 2>and he doesn't want to bake a cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sucks.</v>

2688
01:53:08.231 --> 01:53:10.930
<v Speaker 2>It does suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what you might want to do is what I</v>

2689
01:53:10.931 --> 01:53:13.450
<v Speaker 2>said about an hour ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is maybe leave that town like</v>

2690
01:53:13.451 --> 01:53:15.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe take your skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2691
01:53:15.161 --> 01:53:18.880
<v Speaker 2>whatever worth you bring to a community</v>
<v Speaker 2>and move to a bigger town where there</v>

2692
01:53:18.881 --> 01:53:21.250
<v Speaker 2>probably is some of their do it or order</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cake online.</v>

2693
01:53:21.370 --> 01:53:24.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean the technological part that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just mentioned that you can now tweet</v>

2694
01:53:24.491 --> 01:53:26.590
<v Speaker 2>about stuff and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't go,</v>

2695
01:53:26.591 --> 01:53:29.110
<v Speaker 2>don't go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we have power as people.</v>

2696
01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:32.590
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that we outsource all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>decision making to the government is</v>

2697
01:53:32.591 --> 01:53:34.270
<v Speaker 2>extremely dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2698
01:53:34.271 --> 01:53:37.000
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every horror in human history is a</v>

2699
01:53:37.001 --> 01:53:39.640
<v Speaker 2>government doing things basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2700
01:53:39.641 --> 01:53:41.410
<v Speaker 2>as long as governments have pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 2>existed,</v>

2701
01:53:41.710 --> 01:53:45.070
<v Speaker 2>it's not bands of Nice individual people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that disagree on some stuff murdering.</v>

2702
01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:46.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2703
01:53:46.321 --> 01:53:49.350
<v Speaker 3>I understand your position and I'm with</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to a certain extent.</v>

2704
01:53:49.370 --> 01:53:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish there was a clean answer.</v>

2705
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:53.520
<v Speaker 3>There's no clean answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but freedom is not clean.</v>

2706
01:53:53.521 --> 01:53:54.720
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2707
01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:57.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even the freedom to be a piece of</v>

2708
01:53:57.121 --> 01:53:58.270
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2709
01:53:58.330 --> 01:54:01.690
<v Speaker 3>And to be racist and to be sexist or</v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobic or whatever it is.</v>

2710
01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:02.980
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2711
01:54:03.550 --> 01:54:05.710
<v Speaker 3>we have to define what that is and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first place,</v>

2712
01:54:05.711 --> 01:54:08.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who by whose definition is</v>

2713
01:54:08.021 --> 01:54:10.510
<v Speaker 3>something homophobic or by WHO's deaf?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

2714
01:54:10.511 --> 01:54:12.700
<v Speaker 3>is it homophobic or is it religious</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom?</v>

2715
01:54:12.730 --> 01:54:13.520
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2716
01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:16.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone is deeply religious and their</v>

2717
01:54:16.421 --> 01:54:19.180
<v Speaker 3>religion discriminates against gay</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2718
01:54:19.690 --> 01:54:22.200
<v Speaker 3>are they discriminatory or are they</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious?</v>

2719
01:54:22.201 --> 01:54:24.460
<v Speaker 3>You have to give me an example of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were actually doing.</v>

2720
01:54:25.110 --> 01:54:27.540
<v Speaker 3>Like you're allowed to hate gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2721
01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:29.650
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope that you do not,</v>

2722
01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:33.610
<v Speaker 2>and I actually think this is somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the conservatives have moved.</v>

2723
01:54:33.611 --> 01:54:37.180
<v Speaker 2>I really do think they have moved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's virtually no mainstream</v>

2724
01:54:37.181 --> 01:54:39.580
<v Speaker 2>conservative that's screaming about gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage anymore.</v>

2725
01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Even Mike Huckabee who sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant or like that,</v>

2726
01:54:42.351 --> 01:54:44.080
<v Speaker 2>that the Christian conservative side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2727
01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:47.410
<v Speaker 2>they pretty much have ted Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does he say about gay marriage</v>

2728
01:54:47.411 --> 01:54:49.930
<v Speaker 2>anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's again why rand Paul should</v>

2729
01:54:49.931 --> 01:54:53.200
<v Speaker 2>have led or the the real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the true conservatives that believe in</v>

2730
01:54:53.201 --> 01:54:55.300
<v Speaker 2>limited government should have led the</v>
<v Speaker 2>charge on this.</v>

2731
01:54:55.660 --> 01:54:59.410
<v Speaker 2>So this is where the progressive's did</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something right years ago because</v>

2732
01:54:59.411 --> 01:55:03.220
<v Speaker 2>they were fighting for real equality</v>
<v Speaker 2>because real equality means you should</v>

2733
01:55:03.221 --> 01:55:06.670
<v Speaker 2>be able to marry whoever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't going for extra rights for</v>

2734
01:55:06.671 --> 01:55:08.770
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're going for extra rights</v>

2735
01:55:08.771 --> 01:55:13.050
<v Speaker 2>because we all have equality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean we all have equal</v>

2736
01:55:13.051 --> 01:55:15.360
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have to have equality under the</v>

2737
01:55:15.361 --> 01:55:17.340
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all the government can provide</v>

2738
01:55:17.341 --> 01:55:19.080
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once you have that,</v>

2739
01:55:19.081 --> 01:55:20.880
<v Speaker 2>some of us are going to be born into</v>
<v Speaker 2>more money,</v>

2740
01:55:20.910 --> 01:55:22.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your kids are going to have more</v>

2741
01:55:22.231 --> 01:55:26.320
<v Speaker 2>money then you did right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fact should they be punished for that?</v>

2742
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:28.310
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people would say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a lot of,</v>

2743
01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:29.660
<v Speaker 3>we do think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2744
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:30.171
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2745
01:55:30.171 --> 01:55:34.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe you should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>give your kids money when you die.</v>

2746
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:35.170
<v Speaker 3>We'll do</v>

2747
01:55:35.170 --> 01:55:36.610
<v Speaker 2>the estate tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm mostly,</v>

2748
01:55:36.611 --> 01:55:39.850
<v Speaker 2>I hope that I'll be able to make enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>money in my life that that will be a</v>

2749
01:55:39.851 --> 01:55:41.860
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it will be a problem for you for</v>

2750
01:55:41.861 --> 01:55:43.950
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Short of you go bust on everything</v>

2751
01:55:43.951 --> 01:55:45.270
<v Speaker 2>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm assuming is not going to</v>

2752
01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:48.030
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think at the end of your life</v>

2753
01:55:48.330 --> 01:55:51.060
<v Speaker 2>that you've paid taxes your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've paid payroll taxes because you</v>

2754
01:55:51.061 --> 01:55:53.400
<v Speaker 2>have employees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done all of these things,</v>

2755
01:55:53.401 --> 01:55:54.630
<v Speaker 2>you've done everything right as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>citizen,</v>

2756
01:55:54.631 --> 01:55:57.180
<v Speaker 2>do you think at the end of the day the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government should be able to come in and</v>

2757
01:55:57.181 --> 01:55:59.910
<v Speaker 2>take something like 55% of your money at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

2758
01:56:00.290 --> 01:56:01.340
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's creepy.</v>

2759
01:56:01.341 --> 01:56:03.260
<v Speaker 5>It's creepy that they're able to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2760
01:56:03.261 --> 01:56:06.950
<v Speaker 5>To take money from taxed money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2761
01:56:06.951 --> 01:56:09.050
<v Speaker 5>so the money's already been taxed for</v>
<v Speaker 5>your whole life.</v>

2762
01:56:09.110 --> 01:56:10.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You earned that money and then they're</v>

2763
01:56:10.821 --> 01:56:14.180
<v Speaker 5>going to tax it on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's a mainstream democratic</v>

2764
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:17.000
<v Speaker 5>talking points.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of those things where they're</v>

2765
01:56:17.001 --> 01:56:21.230
<v Speaker 5>dealing with the redistribution of</v>
<v Speaker 5>wealth that that conversation,</v>

2766
01:56:21.231 --> 01:56:24.830
<v Speaker 5>the redistribution of wealth is super</v>
<v Speaker 5>slippery because like who's going to</v>

2767
01:56:24.831 --> 01:56:29.210
<v Speaker 5>redistribute it and to who and like when</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you decide that someone has too much</v>

2768
01:56:29.211 --> 01:56:31.310
<v Speaker 5>money or what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2769
01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:35.030
<v Speaker 5>what's the standard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the metric and what what,</v>

2770
01:56:35.450 --> 01:56:39.320
<v Speaker 5>what occupation are we going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we are we only going to go after the</v>

2771
01:56:39.321 --> 01:56:41.630
<v Speaker 5>bankers and we're going to go after</v>
<v Speaker 5>artists as well.</v>

2772
01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:44.660
<v Speaker 5>Like what if someone's a successful</v>
<v Speaker 5>artist and we're going to take all their</v>

2773
01:56:44.661 --> 01:56:47.510
<v Speaker 5>money are we're going to remove</v>
<v Speaker 5>incentive for success?</v>

2774
01:56:47.511 --> 01:56:51.230
<v Speaker 5>There's a certain line that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to cross where you shouldn't be more</v>

2775
01:56:51.231 --> 01:56:54.530
<v Speaker 5>successful because they're going to tax</v>
<v Speaker 5>you harder if we're going to keep people</v>

2776
01:56:54.531 --> 01:56:55.364
<v Speaker 5>in some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some,</v>

2777
01:56:55.430 --> 01:57:00.260
<v Speaker 5>some sort of an artificially constructed</v>
<v Speaker 5>glass ceiling to avoid being taxed like</v>

2778
01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:01.430
<v Speaker 5>it's a real weird,</v>

2779
01:57:01.610 --> 01:57:03.350
<v Speaker 2>I hate to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everything you just said there is</v>

2780
01:57:03.351 --> 01:57:06.180
<v Speaker 2>completely against what Democrats</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically are for.</v>

2781
01:57:06.181 --> 01:57:09.530
<v Speaker 2>They are for the estate tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the bold why,</v>

2782
01:57:09.531 --> 01:57:12.860
<v Speaker 2>what's the argument?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The argument is you died and now in the</v>

2783
01:57:13.340 --> 01:57:14.540
<v Speaker 2>greater good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2784
01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:16.820
<v Speaker 2>which is a phrase that sounds really</v>
<v Speaker 2>good but it's,</v>

2785
01:57:16.821 --> 01:57:18.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your face pretty much summed it up.</v>

2786
01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:21.050
<v Speaker 2>It never leads to good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we can,</v>

2787
01:57:21.051 --> 01:57:25.580
<v Speaker 2>okay let's just give more money to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that wastes money on everything at</v>

2788
01:57:25.581 --> 01:57:28.970
<v Speaker 2>that has no accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This giant money churning monster.</v>

2789
01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the real issue,</v>

2790
01:57:30.471 --> 01:57:31.850
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that this thing doesn't have</v>

2791
01:57:31.851 --> 01:57:34.460
<v Speaker 2>accountability and that it does waste a</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitload of money.</v>

2792
01:57:34.650 --> 01:57:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the government was slim and trim and</v>

2793
01:57:37.370 --> 01:57:40.250
<v Speaker 2>effective and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were all tax right and it was</v>

2794
01:57:40.251 --> 01:57:42.590
<v Speaker 2>transparent and effective and</v>
<v Speaker 2>functional,</v>

2795
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:44.330
<v Speaker 2>there would be no reason to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian.</v>

2796
01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I'd be sitting here going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm for government.</v>

2797
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:49.400
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if it really operated in a slim</v>

2798
01:57:49.401 --> 01:57:50.690
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what the government doesn't do</v>

2799
01:57:50.691 --> 01:57:53.780
<v Speaker 2>anything good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Name one problem you could possibly have</v>

2800
01:57:53.781 --> 01:57:55.340
<v Speaker 2>in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan that you'd be like,</v>

2801
01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:57.230
<v Speaker 2>get me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the government to solve this.</v>

2802
01:57:57.770 --> 01:57:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Did they do the post office?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2803
01:57:59.180 --> 01:57:59.641
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2804
01:57:59.641 --> 01:58:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Like what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they do.</v>

2805
01:58:01.341 --> 01:58:03.290
<v Speaker 2>The Post Office is pretty good actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but guess what?</v>

2806
01:58:03.291 --> 01:58:05.600
<v Speaker 2>If the post office closes tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be all right.</v>

2807
01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:08.180
<v Speaker 2>You'd still get mail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon pick note.</v>

2808
01:58:08.181 --> 01:58:10.540
<v Speaker 2>When Amazon was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say us through ups,</v>

2809
01:58:10.541 --> 01:58:12.290
<v Speaker 2>it would cost a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't though.</v>

2810
01:58:12.291 --> 01:58:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Competition would start kicking in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>between ups and Fedex and Amazon and</v>

2811
01:58:17.271 --> 01:58:18.350
<v Speaker 2>drones and Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

2812
01:58:18.351 --> 01:58:20.600
<v Speaker 2>blah and DHL,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd all start.</v>

2813
01:58:20.630 --> 01:58:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I would probably drop prices because</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now we've just got this artificial</v>

2814
01:58:24.111 --> 01:58:27.410
<v Speaker 2>thing that sits there that then allows</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to price according to that,</v>

2815
01:58:27.411 --> 01:58:30.830
<v Speaker 2>but if you drop that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is the government in that business</v>

2816
01:58:30.831 --> 01:58:32.240
<v Speaker 2>anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have three chickens.</v>

2817
01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:35.720
<v Speaker 2>I've really done the Joe Rogan lifestyle</v>
<v Speaker 2>here over the last couple of years,</v>

2818
01:58:35.721 --> 01:58:37.220
<v Speaker 2>but I have three chickens right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had,</v>

2819
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:40.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you a good ups story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ordered them.</v>

2820
01:58:40.191 --> 01:58:42.550
<v Speaker 2>They were born August on a Monday</v>

2821
01:58:42.610 --> 01:58:45.490
<v Speaker 1>in a cleveland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hatch that day.</v>

2822
01:58:45.491 --> 01:58:48.310
<v Speaker 1>They threw him in a box with a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>hole you sps,</v>

2823
01:58:48.490 --> 01:58:50.560
<v Speaker 1>and they showed up at my door in La on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday.</v>

2824
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:52.530
<v Speaker 1>The USBS has been doing that for about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred.</v>

2825
01:58:52.531 --> 01:58:53.950
<v Speaker 1>The only way you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2826
01:58:53.951 --> 01:58:57.780
<v Speaker 1>you can't order chickens through any</v>
<v Speaker 1>other methods suggests usbs.</v>

2827
01:58:57.820 --> 01:58:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so actually I was given the usbs credit</v>

2828
01:58:59.681 --> 01:59:01.240
<v Speaker 1>there cause my chickens all arrived</v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

2829
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they send the checks.</v>

2830
01:59:02.690 --> 01:59:03.523
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2831
01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:07.240
<v Speaker 1>you're buying these live checks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way you get them to the US</v>

2832
01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Postal Service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure though that if the u sps</v>

2833
01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:12.160
<v Speaker 1>stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't exist anywhere.</v>

2834
01:59:12.161 --> 01:59:15.040
<v Speaker 1>You'd still get chickens delivered and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon and could probably do it even</v>

2835
01:59:15.041 --> 01:59:16.810
<v Speaker 1>more effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my point.</v>

2836
01:59:16.811 --> 01:59:19.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm not saying these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be eliminated tomorrow.</v>

2837
01:59:19.241 --> 01:59:21.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even really calling for them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be eliminated.</v>

2838
01:59:21.041 --> 01:59:24.120
<v Speaker 1>But just generally what problem would</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2839
01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:25.870
<v Speaker 1>everything you were building here right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

2840
01:59:25.871 --> 01:59:26.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2841
01:59:26.650 --> 01:59:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Do you want the government to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to do all these things and all the</v>

2842
01:59:29.291 --> 01:59:33.190
<v Speaker 1>regulations that you got to have your</v>
<v Speaker 1>electric thing this far from this and</v>

2843
01:59:33.191 --> 01:59:36.490
<v Speaker 1>like all have regulations like that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>construction are important though.</v>

2844
01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:38.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to make sure that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do stupid shit,</v>

2845
01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:43.090
<v Speaker 1>but a power lines near a water line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of,</v>

2846
01:59:43.450 --> 01:59:45.370
<v Speaker 1>but I would put most of that on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>builder's though.</v>

2847
01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:47.510
<v Speaker 1>They want to build things that are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I get hauled.</v>

2848
01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:49.240
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2849
01:59:49.241 --> 01:59:51.730
<v Speaker 1>people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are going to build all the time</v>

2850
01:59:51.731 --> 01:59:54.500
<v Speaker 1>like you have to have regulations when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to construction methods where</v>

2851
01:59:54.501 --> 01:59:56.230
<v Speaker 1>people are going to get fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cut regulate.</v>

2852
01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:58.450
<v Speaker 1>They cut corners when there aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations anyway.</v>

2853
01:59:58.690 --> 02:00:01.240
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would cut a lot more if there</v>

2854
02:00:01.241 --> 02:00:03.640
<v Speaker 1>weren't regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not totally third world countries</v>

2855
02:00:03.641 --> 02:00:04.900
<v Speaker 1>and look at construction methods.</v>

2856
02:00:04.900 --> 02:00:08.020
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why schools collapse on kids and</v>

2857
02:00:08.021 --> 02:00:10.120
<v Speaker 1>foreign countries sometimes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2858
02:00:10.121 --> 02:00:12.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not telling you that I'm against all</v>

2859
02:00:12.131 --> 02:00:13.450
<v Speaker 1>regulation period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where,</v>

2860
02:00:13.650 --> 02:00:16.360
<v Speaker 1>but that's where I said intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that argument because you could</v>

2861
02:00:16.361 --> 02:00:18.400
<v Speaker 1>make us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can make a very sound</v>

2862
02:00:18.401 --> 02:00:22.660
<v Speaker 1>argument that competition would force</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to do better work.</v>

2863
02:00:22.661 --> 02:00:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a vested interest in doing the</v>

2864
02:00:26.021 --> 02:00:29.800
<v Speaker 1>best plumbing job you can so that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were rate you on Yelp so that you will</v>

2865
02:00:29.801 --> 02:00:31.900
<v Speaker 1>get more work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a vested interest in</v>

2866
02:00:31.901 --> 02:00:33.250
<v Speaker 1>cutting corners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might write,</v>

2867
02:00:33.251 --> 02:00:36.550
<v Speaker 1>you're going to push it as much as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can to save as much time and energy and</v>

2868
02:00:36.551 --> 02:00:39.220
<v Speaker 1>money as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you go over that edge,</v>

2869
02:00:39.221 --> 02:00:40.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be known as the guy</v>

2870
02:00:40.541 --> 02:00:42.790
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tighten something too much that you</v>

2871
02:00:42.791 --> 02:00:44.930
<v Speaker 1>flooded the house or when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>building a house.</v>

2872
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Thinking logically though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when when people fuck things up and</v>

2873
02:00:48.311 --> 02:00:51.190
<v Speaker 1>short things and do things terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not thinking logically,</v>

2874
02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's the government that</v>

2875
02:00:53.831 --> 02:00:56.290
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government gave me this regulation</v>

2876
02:00:56.291 --> 02:00:57.940
<v Speaker 1>so that's why I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2877
02:00:58.180 --> 02:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2878
02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:02.440
<v Speaker 1>didn't have any regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be no incentive whatsoever to</v>

2879
02:01:02.450 --> 02:01:02.861
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2880
02:01:02.861 --> 02:01:04.450
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There would be an incentive knew there</v>

2881
02:01:04.451 --> 02:01:07.330
<v Speaker 1>were no inspectors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one was going to check their stuff</v>

2882
02:01:07.331 --> 02:01:09.070
<v Speaker 1>and make sure that their stuff was up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>code.</v>

2883
02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:09.791
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2884
02:01:09.791 --> 02:01:12.400
<v Speaker 1>I was in no instruction my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad was an architect.</v>

2885
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I've been in construction since I was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid.</v>

2886
02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:17.380
<v Speaker 1>You fucking need regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys,</v>

2887
02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:20.020
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people that are in construction</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2888
02:01:20.021 --> 02:01:24.100
<v Speaker 1>they'll do whatever the fuck they can to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make money and it's not good for the</v>

2889
02:01:24.101 --> 02:01:26.920
<v Speaker 1>people that have the house because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>might have that house for five,</v>

2890
02:01:26.921 --> 02:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>10 years before that problem manifests</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

2891
02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>The people who are establishing these</v>
<v Speaker 1>codes are licensed builders or people</v>

2892
02:01:34.691 --> 02:01:38.140
<v Speaker 1>that have been involved in construction</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long fucking time and they know</v>

2893
02:01:38.141 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>what's safe and what's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why</v>

2894
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:43.130
<v Speaker 3>those codes exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It exists to protect the consumers.</v>

2895
02:01:43.250 --> 02:01:46.970
<v Speaker 3>You can't just protect the consumers</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the marketplace because so I'm</v>

2896
02:01:46.971 --> 02:01:50.750
<v Speaker 3>not calling all the time for these</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems to become a real issue and</v>

2897
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:53.840
<v Speaker 3>these problems could potentially damage</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody in the neighborhood.</v>

2898
02:01:53.841 --> 02:01:57.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not just going to affect the person</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this one lot like of a fire starts,</v>

2899
02:01:57.611 --> 02:02:00.800
<v Speaker 3>it burns all the houses in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood or if a flood happens and</v>

2900
02:02:00.801 --> 02:02:02.410
<v Speaker 3>it floods everyone downhill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2901
02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:05.210
<v Speaker 3>it's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to be real careful with</v>

2902
02:02:05.211 --> 02:02:07.570
<v Speaker 3>construction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it and you know,</v>

2903
02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:10.970
<v Speaker 3>my dad wasn't in construction so I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 3>privy to like all of that,</v>

2904
02:02:11.450 --> 02:02:14.690
<v Speaker 3>the little stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I genuinely believe that as a</v>

2905
02:02:14.691 --> 02:02:18.710
<v Speaker 3>general level people have a vested</v>
<v Speaker 3>interest in,</v>

2906
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:23.570
<v Speaker 3>especially now because of phones and</v>
<v Speaker 3>apps and yelp and all of them doing good</v>

2907
02:02:23.660 --> 02:02:25.800
<v Speaker 3>work because that's how you will get</v>
<v Speaker 3>more work.</v>

2908
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:28.220
<v Speaker 3>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to remove the people</v>

2909
02:02:28.221 --> 02:02:31.520
<v Speaker 3>who will do shotty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty malicious shit,</v>

2910
02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:34.070
<v Speaker 3>but you can keep them at bay with</v>
<v Speaker 3>regulation.</v>

2911
02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I think this is where I'd say you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>hate it.</v>

2912
02:02:36.021 --> 02:02:37.520
<v Speaker 3>Some regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>educated,</v>

2913
02:02:37.521 --> 02:02:40.160
<v Speaker 3>regulate regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who actually understand what's</v>

2914
02:02:40.161 --> 02:02:42.890
<v Speaker 3>going on and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that someone doesn't do</v>

2915
02:02:42.891 --> 02:02:46.540
<v Speaker 3>something stupid with a power line or</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone do something stupid with the,</v>

2916
02:02:46.541 --> 02:02:48.860
<v Speaker 3>the way they constructed main beams</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the,</v>

2917
02:02:48.861 --> 02:02:52.340
<v Speaker 3>they're just subject to collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I that's important because most people</v>

2918
02:02:52.341 --> 02:02:53.840
<v Speaker 3>buying a house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck they're</v>

2919
02:02:53.841 --> 02:02:55.940
<v Speaker 3>looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people getting a house built,</v>

2920
02:02:56.240 --> 02:03:00.380
<v Speaker 3>they have no idea about construction</v>
<v Speaker 3>methods and they need someone to inspect</v>

2921
02:03:00.381 --> 02:03:02.180
<v Speaker 3>things and make sure that it's up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>code.</v>

2922
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:04.550
<v Speaker 3>That's why code exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very important.</v>

2923
02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:05.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw,</v>

2924
02:03:05.351 --> 02:03:07.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not totally with you on that.</v>

2925
02:03:07.431 --> 02:03:09.620
<v Speaker 3>Like I do think Mo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think most of it,</v>

2926
02:03:09.621 --> 02:03:14.060
<v Speaker 3>probably 90% of it would be who has the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most vested interest to build a good</v>

2927
02:03:14.061 --> 02:03:14.390
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

2928
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:16.280
<v Speaker 3>It's the builder because he wants more</v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

2929
02:03:16.281 --> 02:03:18.270
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't want the house to collapse</v>
<v Speaker 3>because then he'll be added.</v>

2930
02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:19.333
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2931
02:03:19.390 --> 02:03:20.450
<v Speaker 3>I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got you though.</v>

2932
02:03:20.570 --> 02:03:22.540
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he's got not just cops.</v>

2933
02:03:22.890 --> 02:03:27.530
<v Speaker 3>There's a specific thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dangerous thing too,</v>

2934
02:03:27.531 --> 02:03:29.630
<v Speaker 3>because it's where you sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's where your kids sleep.</v>

2935
02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:30.473
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2936
02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:32.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

2937
02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:37.600
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of idealistic</v>
<v Speaker 3>notions about deregulation and I think</v>

2938
02:03:37.911 --> 02:03:41.180
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some consumer protection has to</v>

2939
02:03:41.181 --> 02:03:46.181
<v Speaker 3>be put in place because people don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the time to spend all this time</v>

2940
02:03:46.581 --> 02:03:50.090
<v Speaker 3>researching construction methods and</v>
<v Speaker 3>making sure everything's done correctly</v>

2941
02:03:50.091 --> 02:03:53.630
<v Speaker 3>and be there and make sure that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>joists are a certain width and they have</v>

2942
02:03:53.631 --> 02:03:56.510
<v Speaker 3>a certain amount of support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all that stuff has to be done by</v>

2943
02:03:56.511 --> 02:04:00.380
<v Speaker 3>people who understand code,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assuming that the government regulators</v>

2944
02:04:00.381 --> 02:04:03.860
<v Speaker 3>understand code correctly and aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>just on the take or just try,</v>

2945
02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:05.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2946
02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:07.970
<v Speaker 3>just basically just taking money and</v>
<v Speaker 3>signing off on things.</v>

2947
02:04:07.970 --> 02:04:09.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>house Spec things,</v>

2948
02:04:09.951 --> 02:04:11.930
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you ever had a construction project</v>

2949
02:04:11.931 --> 02:04:12.350
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2950
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:15.650
<v Speaker 3>well I got my house last year and we had</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go through all the inspections and</v>

2951
02:04:15.651 --> 02:04:18.050
<v Speaker 3>had several guys come back and we didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>build it.</v>

2952
02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:21.440
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a big difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>insurance inspector and a code</v>

2953
02:04:21.441 --> 02:04:23.690
<v Speaker 3>inspector.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Code inspectors are very different when</v>

2954
02:04:23.691 --> 02:04:27.110
<v Speaker 3>you're having a house built.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've had construction projects where</v>

2955
02:04:27.111 --> 02:04:29.130
<v Speaker 3>I had to explain to people and go</v>
<v Speaker 3>through it with,</v>

2956
02:04:29.131 --> 02:04:31.950
<v Speaker 3>with builders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there making sure that the house</v>

2957
02:04:31.951 --> 02:04:34.880
<v Speaker 3>is in fucking fall on you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the power lines,</v>

2958
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:35.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

2959
02:04:35.491 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 3>are done correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that all the electricity done</v>

2960
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:39.000
<v Speaker 4>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pipes,</v>

2961
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:40.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>late incorrectly,</v>

2962
02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:42.180
<v Speaker 4>your septic system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where your sewage system has done</v>

2963
02:04:42.181 --> 02:04:45.150
<v Speaker 4>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that could be privatized</v>

2964
02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:46.550
<v Speaker 4>then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2965
02:04:46.551 --> 02:04:47.384
<v Speaker 4>cause again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

2966
02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:49.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think it's an regulations.</v>

2967
02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:52.080
<v Speaker 4>How would it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how would you could have the company no</v>

2968
02:04:52.081 --> 02:04:53.010
<v Speaker 4>incentive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well No,</v>

2969
02:04:53.011 --> 02:04:57.600
<v Speaker 4>you could have companies that would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that their job would be to make sure to</v>

2970
02:04:57.601 --> 02:04:58.434
<v Speaker 4>inspect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2971
02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:01.830
<v Speaker 4>And you wouldn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't have the thread of law to,</v>

2972
02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:03.990
<v Speaker 4>to enforce these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if someone is,</v>

2973
02:05:04.620 --> 02:05:06.720
<v Speaker 4>if someone is building something and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not up to code,</v>

2974
02:05:06.721 --> 02:05:08.730
<v Speaker 4>they lose their license and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>build.</v>

2975
02:05:08.970 --> 02:05:11.790
<v Speaker 4>If you privatized it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the incentive for them to follow</v>

2976
02:05:11.791 --> 02:05:13.230
<v Speaker 4>the guidelines?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2977
02:05:13.231 --> 02:05:15.510
<v Speaker 4>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is where I'm not telling you that</v>

2978
02:05:15.511 --> 02:05:17.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm calling for all this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think intellectually it's just an</v>

2979
02:05:17.911 --> 02:05:20.790
<v Speaker 4>interesting space to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to argue something.</v>

2980
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:25.200
<v Speaker 4>Cause I think that there's more the more</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can give to people to freely do</v>

2981
02:05:25.410 --> 02:05:27.960
<v Speaker 4>what they think is right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think generally they will.</v>

2982
02:05:27.961 --> 02:05:29.040
<v Speaker 4>Like again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

2983
02:05:29.041 --> 02:05:32.670
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be some real shitty</v>
<v Speaker 4>construction people out there you don't</v>

2984
02:05:32.671 --> 02:05:33.870
<v Speaker 4>think you should have on to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

2985
02:05:33.871 --> 02:05:36.630
<v Speaker 4>And I think people have looped you in</v>
<v Speaker 4>before is you're on Brooke from uh,</v>

2986
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:38.130
<v Speaker 4>from mine ran institute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

2987
02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:40.640
<v Speaker 4>cause he's no only sweet began with no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2988
02:05:40.650 --> 02:05:42.150
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'll be happy if they have,</v>

2989
02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:43.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2990
02:05:43.171 --> 02:05:44.130
<v Speaker 4>So I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be happy to do it.</v>

2991
02:05:44.131 --> 02:05:47.220
<v Speaker 4>He's a really interesting guy whose</v>
<v Speaker 4>mother was thinking a little bit on</v>

2992
02:05:47.221 --> 02:05:49.110
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those iron brand people are fucking</v>

2993
02:05:49.111 --> 02:05:50.490
<v Speaker 4>harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They like ideas,</v>

2994
02:05:50.491 --> 02:05:51.324
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are,</v>

2995
02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:55.470
<v Speaker 4>they're not the most fun people on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>there on the planet.</v>

2996
02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:57.570
<v Speaker 4>But I generally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I generally liked them because they just</v>

2997
02:05:57.571 --> 02:05:58.950
<v Speaker 4>want their kind of live and let live.</v>

2998
02:05:59.050 --> 02:06:01.560
<v Speaker 4>That's really it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's like the crux of it pretty</v>

2999
02:06:01.561 --> 02:06:03.600
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that really the crux of it or I mean,</v>

3000
02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:05.610
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people think that there's like sort of a</v>

3001
02:06:05.611 --> 02:06:09.090
<v Speaker 4>cruelty aspect to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ran philosophy,</v>

3002
02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:12.210
<v Speaker 4>well they believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in rational self interest,</v>

3003
02:06:12.211 --> 02:06:15.390
<v Speaker 4>which if you say self,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes people think you're evil.</v>

3004
02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:17.940
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we all basically operate in rational</v>

3005
02:06:17.941 --> 02:06:19.650
<v Speaker 4>self interest all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3006
02:06:19.651 --> 02:06:21.760
<v Speaker 4>But espousing it with us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing,</v>

3007
02:06:21.761 --> 02:06:23.970
<v Speaker 4>it's like proclaiming it is a thing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people go,</v>

3008
02:06:23.971 --> 02:06:24.900
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3009
02:06:25.170 --> 02:06:27.370
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're essentially setting up the idea</v>

3010
02:06:27.371 --> 02:06:29.610
<v Speaker 4>of the Gordon Gekko idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greed is good.</v>

3011
02:06:30.170 --> 02:06:33.480
<v Speaker 4>I kind of buy into that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you buy into greed is good.</v>

3012
02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:35.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically not greed to destroy the</v>

3013
02:06:35.941 --> 02:06:38.010
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you do you joe,</v>

3014
02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:41.400
<v Speaker 4>do what is good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by extension greed,</v>

3015
02:06:41.730 --> 02:06:43.210
<v Speaker 4>well that's [inaudible] ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3016
02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:44.431
<v Speaker 4>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3017
02:06:44.431 --> 02:06:45.420
<v Speaker 4>That's my point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3018
02:06:45.730 --> 02:06:47.340
<v Speaker 4>Where it gets conflated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

3019
02:06:47.550 --> 02:06:48.383
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So with,</v>

3020
02:06:48.390 --> 02:06:51.600
<v Speaker 4>so without wiggling it to the definition</v>
<v Speaker 4>of greed versus ambition,</v>

3021
02:06:51.601 --> 02:06:53.660
<v Speaker 4>it's like you do what's good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3022
02:06:53.661 --> 02:06:55.170
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't mean you're just running</v>

3023
02:06:55.171 --> 02:06:59.160
<v Speaker 4>this like rampaging program to destroy</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world in the name of Joe Rogan.</v>

3024
02:06:59.161 --> 02:07:02.820
<v Speaker 4>You're doing what's good for you because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you actually like your audience and you</v>

3025
02:07:02.821 --> 02:07:05.610
<v Speaker 4>want them to learn you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to have money so that your</v>

3026
02:07:05.611 --> 02:07:08.210
<v Speaker 4>family can live in a house that you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>afford,</v>

3027
02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:10.650
<v Speaker 4>that you can send your kids to good</v>
<v Speaker 4>schools and all of those things.</v>

3028
02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:14.880
<v Speaker 4>That's all rational self interest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If at the same time you were running a</v>

3029
02:07:14.881 --> 02:07:18.300
<v Speaker 4>nuclear power plant and you are Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Burns and you were dumping in the river,</v>

3030
02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:20.940
<v Speaker 4>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's actually no longer rational self</v>

3031
02:07:20.941 --> 02:07:23.670
<v Speaker 4>interest because now you're polluting</v>
<v Speaker 4>the very environment that you live in.</v>

3032
02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:26.220
<v Speaker 4>So rational,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the key takes care of that.</v>

3033
02:07:26.221 --> 02:07:27.960
<v Speaker 4>Who regulates that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

3034
02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:31.410
<v Speaker 4>so generally comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So those guys,</v>

3035
02:07:31.411 --> 02:07:33.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to speak for a little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets you in trouble if you,</v>

3036
02:07:33.811 --> 02:07:34.970
<v Speaker 4>in your opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

3037
02:07:35.110 --> 02:07:36.640
<v Speaker 4>you're this deregulation</v>

3038
02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:39.370
<v Speaker 3>guy who goes after you when you dump</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit into the river.</v>

3039
02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:41.220
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not saying there should be no</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation.</v>

3040
02:07:41.221 --> 02:07:44.610
<v Speaker 2>I just was saying that I like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally I like this line of thinking</v>

3041
02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:47.040
<v Speaker 2>there has to be some regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree you can't.</v>

3042
02:07:47.250 --> 02:07:48.250
<v Speaker 2>But what I would say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3043
02:07:48.251 --> 02:07:50.820
<v Speaker 2>that's where the regulation comes in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment.</v>

3044
02:07:51.260 --> 02:07:51.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

3045
02:07:51.721 --> 02:07:54.960
<v Speaker 2>I would say there has to be some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've had some interesting people on</v>

3046
02:07:54.961 --> 02:07:57.450
<v Speaker 2>conservatives who are dealing with doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3047
02:07:57.780 --> 02:08:00.660
<v Speaker 2>environmental stuff from a conservative</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective that there's ways to make</v>

3048
02:08:00.661 --> 02:08:05.280
<v Speaker 2>money actually in green stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in green products and in Al Gore.</v>

3049
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:05.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3050
02:08:05.831 --> 02:08:06.121
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3051
02:08:06.121 --> 02:08:07.950
<v Speaker 2>he's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that he's creating anything</v>

3052
02:08:07.951 --> 02:08:11.010
<v Speaker 2>other than movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's making me make a lot of money,</v>

3053
02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:13.050
<v Speaker 2>a lot of money in green corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3054
02:08:13.230 --> 02:08:15.360
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's him doing it privately,</v>

3055
02:08:15.410 --> 02:08:16.243
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3056
02:08:16.250 --> 02:08:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what is like,</v>

3057
02:08:17.961 --> 02:08:21.820
<v Speaker 3>what's the solution if someone pollutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not going to have regulation,</v>

3058
02:08:21.821 --> 02:08:24.280
<v Speaker 3>what is the solution?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone does something that's</v>

3059
02:08:24.281 --> 02:08:25.114
<v Speaker 3>illegal?</v>

3060
02:08:25.750 --> 02:08:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not going to have regulation,</v>

3061
02:08:26.861 --> 02:08:28.510
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your question is,</v>

3062
02:08:28.690 --> 02:08:30.350
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's illegal dump,</v>

3063
02:08:30.380 --> 02:08:32.540
<v Speaker 3>dump things into the river,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3064
02:08:32.970 --> 02:08:34.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just illegal.</v>

3065
02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:36.390
<v Speaker 3>That's not a matter of regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3066
02:08:36.450 --> 02:08:39.780
<v Speaker 3>polluting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll willful poisoning of rivers.</v>

3067
02:08:39.870 --> 02:08:43.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's actually terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be a bunch of like,</v>

3068
02:08:44.130 --> 02:08:46.350
<v Speaker 2>so what those guys would argue is what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>said before,</v>

3069
02:08:46.351 --> 02:08:49.320
<v Speaker 2>which is that ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially now because of technology,</v>

3070
02:08:49.321 --> 02:08:51.540
<v Speaker 2>like in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like every time someone cuts</v>

3071
02:08:51.541 --> 02:08:53.190
<v Speaker 2>regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard Bill Maher say this a lot,</v>

3072
02:08:53.191 --> 02:08:55.460
<v Speaker 2>they're going to start a polluting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>river immediately.</v>

3073
02:08:55.670 --> 02:08:57.860
<v Speaker 2>That implies that these businessmen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever their,</v>

3074
02:08:57.861 --> 02:08:58.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're,</v>

3075
02:08:58.670 --> 02:09:00.380
<v Speaker 2>whatever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever industry that they're in,</v>

3076
02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:02.060
<v Speaker 2>that they're immediately going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3077
02:09:02.061 --> 02:09:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the regulations gone start polluting the</v>

3078
02:09:04.341 --> 02:09:06.560
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in a time now where everyone's</v>

3079
02:09:06.561 --> 02:09:09.710
<v Speaker 2>walking around with an iphone where</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 50 years ago you could've got away</v>

3080
02:09:09.711 --> 02:09:11.600
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of bad shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3081
02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Coal miners that we're breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of horrible shit that nobody</v>

3082
02:09:15.381 --> 02:09:18.890
<v Speaker 2>was ever going to find out about where</v>
<v Speaker 2>now everybody is walking around with</v>

3083
02:09:18.891 --> 02:09:20.870
<v Speaker 2>snapchat and instagram and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

3084
02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:25.400
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of this stuff would be exposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>more so that all of the things that</v>

3085
02:09:25.401 --> 02:09:27.470
<v Speaker 2>we've been talking about for the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of hours about,</v>

3086
02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:31.910
<v Speaker 2>about people getting involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the things I think would start</v>

3087
02:09:31.940 --> 02:09:33.650
<v Speaker 2>self regulating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

3088
02:09:33.651 --> 02:09:36.350
<v Speaker 2>and then I won't say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not for just deregulating</v>

3089
02:09:36.590 --> 02:09:38.600
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think there's probably better</v>

3090
02:09:38.601 --> 02:09:42.590
<v Speaker 2>ways to do it than just having the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government come in and say,</v>

3091
02:09:42.591 --> 02:09:46.310
<v Speaker 2>this is what you gotta do and now figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>it out because the government isn't that</v>

3092
02:09:46.311 --> 02:09:47.600
<v Speaker 2>good at most things.</v>

3093
02:09:48.190 --> 02:09:49.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying there.</v>

3094
02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:50.500
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3095
02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:54.160
<v Speaker 3>I do think that obviously there has to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be laws in place,</v>

3096
02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:56.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically laws in place that protect</v>

3097
02:09:56.861 --> 02:10:00.250
<v Speaker 3>people from someone doing something and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to damage all the other</v>

3098
02:10:00.251 --> 02:10:01.120
<v Speaker 3>people in the community.</v>

3099
02:10:01.290 --> 02:10:01.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3100
02:10:01.831 --> 02:10:02.341
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3101
02:10:02.341 --> 02:10:05.190
<v Speaker 2>so you can do that from the government</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to protect your life and your</v>

3102
02:10:05.191 --> 02:10:05.701
<v Speaker 2>property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3103
02:10:05.701 --> 02:10:08.160
<v Speaker 2>that's a very simple libertarian thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

3104
02:10:08.161 --> 02:10:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that there's a good argument there</v>

3105
02:10:09.961 --> 02:10:13.120
<v Speaker 2>for why you could have some level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation.</v>

3106
02:10:13.121 --> 02:10:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3107
02:10:13.220 --> 02:10:17.060
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think it's just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically in terms of like someone</v>

3108
02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:20.100
<v Speaker 3>polluting rivers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's good enough to snap</v>

3109
02:10:20.101 --> 02:10:22.430
<v Speaker 3>chat about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people should be locked up and</v>

3110
02:10:22.431 --> 02:10:26.180
<v Speaker 3>go to jail if they find out that</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's dumping toxic waste into the</v>

3111
02:10:26.181 --> 02:10:31.181
<v Speaker 3>river because it's too expensive to</v>
<v Speaker 3>process it and get it removed and put in</v>

3112
02:10:31.281 --> 02:10:32.780
<v Speaker 3>some place where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3113
02:10:32.930 --> 02:10:33.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe.</v>

3114
02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:35.450
<v Speaker 5>That's a crime.</v>

3115
02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm all for finding those people</v>

3116
02:10:37.641 --> 02:10:39.470
<v Speaker 2>and having the company's fire them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those things.</v>

3117
02:10:39.471 --> 02:10:43.010
<v Speaker 2>As far as putting them in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that I'm glad come up.</v>

3118
02:10:43.070 --> 02:10:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that I'm getting them off</v>

3119
02:10:44.271 --> 02:10:45.800
<v Speaker 2>the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take the money,</v>

3120
02:10:45.801 --> 02:10:49.730
<v Speaker 2>give it to Bernie's kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of putting more people in</v>

3121
02:10:49.731 --> 02:10:50.890
<v Speaker 2>jail generally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

3122
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:51.471
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3123
02:10:51.471 --> 02:10:52.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm not either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3124
02:10:52.641 --> 02:10:54.770
<v Speaker 5>I think that's one of the more</v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting things that happened in this</v>

3125
02:10:54.771 --> 02:10:59.600
<v Speaker 5>administration is when Kim Kardashian</v>
<v Speaker 5>got that lady incredible generated or</v>

3126
02:10:59.601 --> 02:11:03.210
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did got a release to get her sentence</v>

3127
02:11:03.211 --> 02:11:04.890
<v Speaker 5>commuted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's Kinda crazy.</v>

3128
02:11:04.891 --> 02:11:08.940
<v Speaker 5>Like she showed up and she presented</v>
<v Speaker 5>this case about some woman who's,</v>

3129
02:11:08.941 --> 02:11:10.680
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>been in jail for,</v>

3130
02:11:10.710 --> 02:11:14.010
<v Speaker 5>she's essentially jail for life for</v>
<v Speaker 5>nonviolent drug offense.</v>

3131
02:11:14.011 --> 02:11:14.844
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3132
02:11:15.010 --> 02:11:18.740
<v Speaker 2>And how many other people are like her</v>
<v Speaker 2>for non violent drug?</v>

3133
02:11:18.741 --> 02:11:21.320
<v Speaker 2>A pen this long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something with your own body.</v>

3134
02:11:21.450 --> 02:11:24.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's where we're full and total</v>

3135
02:11:24.661 --> 02:11:28.290
<v Speaker 5>agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think that this idea that the</v>

3136
02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:33.240
<v Speaker 5>pharmaceutical companies can sell drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people can't sell drugs that they</v>

3137
02:11:33.241 --> 02:11:35.550
<v Speaker 5>can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're responsible for the UN</v>

3138
02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:40.020
<v Speaker 5>untenable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The unimaginable number of people that</v>

3139
02:11:40.021 --> 02:11:43.230
<v Speaker 5>have died from opiate withdrawal or</v>
<v Speaker 5>opiate,</v>

3140
02:11:43.231 --> 02:11:44.370
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>overdoses.</v>

3141
02:11:44.371 --> 02:11:45.600
<v Speaker 5>Fentanyl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3142
02:11:45.601 --> 02:11:48.390
<v Speaker 5>fentanyl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just last year we lost Tom Petty.</v>

3143
02:11:48.391 --> 02:11:50.460
<v Speaker 5>We lost prince.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3144
02:11:50.970 --> 02:11:52.560
<v Speaker 5>couple of other people too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember.</v>

3145
02:11:52.561 --> 02:11:54.780
<v Speaker 5>There's some other famous people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>died from fentanyl.</v>

3146
02:11:55.070 --> 02:11:56.280
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3147
02:11:56.290 --> 02:11:57.420
<v Speaker 5>Patton,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oswald's wife,</v>

3148
02:11:57.660 --> 02:11:59.700
<v Speaker 5>she was another fentanyl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

3149
02:11:59.701 --> 02:12:01.440
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a horrible,</v>

3150
02:12:01.530 --> 02:12:06.090
<v Speaker 5>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>horrible drug and no one's clamoring for</v>

3151
02:12:06.091 --> 02:12:07.080
<v Speaker 5>these people to go to jail</v>

3152
02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:10.100
<v Speaker 2>scratching drugs all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go watch cable news all day long.</v>

3153
02:12:10.101 --> 02:12:14.240
<v Speaker 2>What are they selling all day long?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prescription drugs with a zillion side</v>

3154
02:12:14.241 --> 02:12:18.380
<v Speaker 2>effects that are seemingly far worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including thoughts of suicide and</v>

3155
02:12:18.381 --> 02:12:19.131
<v Speaker 2>depression and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

3156
02:12:19.131 --> 02:12:20.570
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the original thing they're trying</v>

3157
02:12:20.571 --> 02:12:23.600
<v Speaker 2>to treat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So look when specifically opiates.</v>

3158
02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3159
02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:25.990
<v Speaker 5>it's of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the real deadly ones.</v>

3160
02:12:25.991 --> 02:12:28.510
<v Speaker 5>And then you think about how many people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are in jail right now for</v>

3161
02:12:28.511 --> 02:12:30.670
<v Speaker 5>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many people that are in jail for</v>

3162
02:12:30.671 --> 02:12:33.130
<v Speaker 5>cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many in jail people are in jail for</v>

3163
02:12:33.790 --> 02:12:35.960
<v Speaker 5>psychedelics?</v>
<v Speaker 5>MTMA mean it's,</v>

3164
02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:39.280
<v Speaker 5>there's no comparison in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of damage done per capita.</v>

3165
02:12:39.420 --> 02:12:40.430
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree.</v>

3166
02:12:40.431 --> 02:12:43.700
<v Speaker 2>Look when when the thing happened with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roseanne and then she blamed ambient or</v>

3167
02:12:43.701 --> 02:12:46.730
<v Speaker 2>she at least said she was on Ambien,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the Ambien,</v>

3168
02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:48.140
<v Speaker 2>the parent company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was,</v>

3169
02:12:48.141 --> 02:12:51.140
<v Speaker 2>they tweeted out something like there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are a lot of side effects but it doesn't</v>

3170
02:12:51.141 --> 02:12:54.770
<v Speaker 2>make you racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But knowing how Glib and ridiculous that</v>

3171
02:12:54.771 --> 02:12:55.311
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3172
02:12:55.311 --> 02:12:58.130
<v Speaker 2>No one is saying that ambien makes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>

3173
02:12:58.460 --> 02:13:01.100
<v Speaker 2>but ambien does have a litany of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

3174
02:13:01.101 --> 02:13:03.330
<v Speaker 2>50 side effects it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3175
02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:06.010
<v Speaker 2>sleepwalking saying crazy things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating,</v>

3176
02:13:06.110 --> 02:13:08.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally just being unable to control</v>

3177
02:13:08.541 --> 02:13:11.630
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing while you're on ambien</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in this Zombie like state.</v>

3178
02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:15.920
<v Speaker 2>So is it possible that even though she</v>
<v Speaker 2>has also said that she didn't realize</v>

3179
02:13:15.921 --> 02:13:18.680
<v Speaker 2>that Valerie Jarret was black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I actually kind of do believe.</v>

3180
02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:21.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent it to me.</v>

3181
02:13:21.170 --> 02:13:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know her.</v>

3182
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:23.270
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3183
02:13:23.271 --> 02:13:24.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know her a little bit.</v>

3184
02:13:24.381 --> 02:13:24.760
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

3185
02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:26.660
<v Speaker 5>she didn't think she was black.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe her.</v>

3186
02:13:26.710 --> 02:13:30.970
<v Speaker 5>I believe her 100% but look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she said dumb shit in the,</v>

3187
02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:32.160
<v Speaker 5>the Susan Rice</v>

3188
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:35.880
<v Speaker 3>thing was much more egregious to one</v>
<v Speaker 3>where she said that a Susan right rice</v>

3189
02:13:35.881 --> 02:13:38.160
<v Speaker 3>was a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight balls.</v>

3190
02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:39.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3191
02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:41.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not defending what rue events at</v>

3192
02:13:41.071 --> 02:13:44.610
<v Speaker 3>all I'm saying is that Ambien,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the maker sends out this Glib tweet,</v>

3193
02:13:44.611 --> 02:13:46.650
<v Speaker 3>like we don't make people racists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but guess what?</v>

3194
02:13:46.651 --> 02:13:50.250
<v Speaker 3>You have people doing all kinds of crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit that they can,</v>

3195
02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:53.640
<v Speaker 3>having conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have driven their cars and the</v>

3196
02:13:53.641 --> 02:13:56.160
<v Speaker 3>wrong side of the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who have done all kinds of crazy</v>

3197
02:13:56.161 --> 02:13:56.820
<v Speaker 3>shit on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3198
02:13:56.820 --> 02:14:01.470
<v Speaker 3>So is it possible that made her impaired</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to have a stupid thought and then</v>

3199
02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:04.020
<v Speaker 3>100% yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 100% there's definitely side</v>

3200
02:14:04.021 --> 02:14:04.740
<v Speaker 3>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

3201
02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:07.800
<v Speaker 3>whether or not they're responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 3>those side effects is where it gets into</v>

3202
02:14:08.100 --> 02:14:10.710
<v Speaker 3>the realm of personal responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3203
02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:14.220
<v Speaker 3>if you take ambien and you do something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you responsible for it?</v>

3204
02:14:14.610 --> 02:14:15.443
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3205
02:14:15.450 --> 02:14:16.500
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we going to say?</v>

3206
02:14:16.710 --> 02:14:19.440
<v Speaker 3>If you drink and you go commit a violent</v>
<v Speaker 3>crime,</v>

3207
02:14:19.441 --> 02:14:20.880
<v Speaker 3>are you responsible for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all agree,</v>

3208
02:14:20.881 --> 02:14:22.830
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it gets real strange.</v>

3209
02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:24.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets real strange.</v>

3210
02:14:25.110 --> 02:14:27.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the weird things when it</v>

3211
02:14:27.241 --> 02:14:30.450
<v Speaker 3>comes to gender and responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's been so many issues of</v>

3212
02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:32.190
<v Speaker 3>men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>

3213
02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:34.770
<v Speaker 3>it's almost always men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never hear about these from gay</v>

3214
02:14:34.771 --> 02:14:37.200
<v Speaker 3>couples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but men and women or I haven't heard</v>

3215
02:14:37.201 --> 02:14:38.520
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least men and women,</v>

3216
02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:40.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting drunk and having sex and then</v>

3217
02:14:40.801 --> 02:14:45.801
<v Speaker 3>the man gets accused of sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this has gotten so weird that a guy,</v>

3218
02:14:46.260 --> 02:14:50.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>preemptively guy and a girl got had sex</v>

3219
02:14:50.610 --> 02:14:51.950
<v Speaker 3>and the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3220
02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:56.400
<v Speaker 3>called the police and wanted her charge</v>
<v Speaker 3>was sexual assault because he was drunk.</v>

3221
02:14:56.610 --> 02:14:59.220
<v Speaker 3>And he did it as a preemptive measure</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was worried that she was</v>

3222
02:14:59.221 --> 02:15:00.060
<v Speaker 3>going to come after him.</v>

3223
02:15:00.450 --> 02:15:03.510
<v Speaker 3>And so the university took action</v>
<v Speaker 3>against the girl and I'm like,</v>

3224
02:15:03.511 --> 02:15:06.030
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we play in little stupid games.</v>

3225
02:15:06.031 --> 02:15:08.790
<v Speaker 3>And pretending that girls rape guys when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're drunk or that it's really</v>

3226
02:15:08.791 --> 02:15:11.610
<v Speaker 3>devastating for the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck are we doing?</v>

3227
02:15:11.950 --> 02:15:15.640
<v Speaker 3>We are going to criminalize everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to criminalize every,</v>

3228
02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:18.240
<v Speaker 3>I think of all of the stupid things</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've done in your life,</v>

3229
02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:21.490
<v Speaker 3>whether on drugs or not or whether we</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were in college or not</v>

3230
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:23.820
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now add social media to that.</v>

3231
02:15:23.821 --> 02:15:27.100
<v Speaker 3>Add the the amount of pictures that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people send to each other and everything</v>

3232
02:15:27.101 --> 02:15:29.760
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we don't stop this attic control</v>

3233
02:15:30.030 --> 02:15:32.580
<v Speaker 3>monster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are all just going to destroy each</v>

3234
02:15:32.581 --> 02:15:34.620
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a gray area because we know</v>

3235
02:15:34.621 --> 02:15:37.230
<v Speaker 3>that some people do take advantage of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are drunk.</v>

3236
02:15:37.231 --> 02:15:40.110
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone was like porn drunk drinks</v>

3237
02:15:40.111 --> 02:15:42.450
<v Speaker 3>down someone's face and they were sober</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were doing it with the</v>

3238
02:15:42.451 --> 02:15:45.960
<v Speaker 3>intention of raping them once they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>intoxicated and they couldn't consent</v>

3239
02:15:45.961 --> 02:15:47.430
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one thing.</v>

3240
02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:50.480
<v Speaker 3>But if two people are getting together</v>
<v Speaker 3>and drinking and then having sex and</v>

3241
02:15:50.481 --> 02:15:52.740
<v Speaker 3>then the woman has regret in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she sobers up.</v>

3242
02:15:52.741 --> 02:15:56.370
<v Speaker 3>So she decides that it was rape because</v>
<v Speaker 3>she and he were both drunk.</v>

3243
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:59.430
<v Speaker 3>That's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we don't have this ability to</v>

3244
02:15:59.610 --> 02:16:04.110
<v Speaker 3>rationally process each and individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each individual case.</v>

3245
02:16:04.220 --> 02:16:06.240
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's something that trump did that was</v>

3246
02:16:06.241 --> 02:16:08.550
<v Speaker 3>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got rid of those ridiculous title</v>

3247
02:16:08.551 --> 02:16:12.600
<v Speaker 3>nine laws that Obama in stated where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were basically having these clown</v>

3248
02:16:12.601 --> 02:16:16.950
<v Speaker 3>courts in colleges that you could go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>them and instead of having due process,</v>

3249
02:16:16.951 --> 02:16:20.570
<v Speaker 3>which is perhaps the most important</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of,</v>

3250
02:16:20.580 --> 02:16:24.510
<v Speaker 3>of a functioning western free society</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you are innocent until proven</v>

3251
02:16:24.511 --> 02:16:27.150
<v Speaker 3>guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were suspending male students just</v>

3252
02:16:27.151 --> 02:16:30.220
<v Speaker 3>by accusations and then it was leaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had Laura Kipnis</v>

3253
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:33.370
<v Speaker 1>on who's a professor that they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was fighting against title nine so</v>

3254
02:16:33.371 --> 02:16:35.260
<v Speaker 1>then they brought up title nine charges</v>
<v Speaker 1>against her.</v>

3255
02:16:35.261 --> 02:16:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's many,</v>

3256
02:16:36.551 --> 02:16:39.250
<v Speaker 1>many other stories on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that Obama brought in</v>

3257
02:16:39.251 --> 02:16:41.170
<v Speaker 1>that trump actually got rid of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

3258
02:16:41.171 --> 02:16:43.720
<v Speaker 1>What's her name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Betsy devoss got rid of.</v>

3259
02:16:43.810 --> 02:16:47.920
<v Speaker 1>So it's like we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've just gotten to the point where</v>

3260
02:16:47.921 --> 02:16:52.150
<v Speaker 1>we've politicized everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've politicized our own capacity to be</v>

3261
02:16:52.151 --> 02:16:56.770
<v Speaker 1>free and make decisions for ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get drunk and are fooling around</v>

3262
02:16:56.771 --> 02:16:58.840
<v Speaker 1>with somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that's on you,</v>

3263
02:16:59.110 --> 02:17:00.260
<v Speaker 1>you might regret it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next one,</v>

3264
02:17:00.261 --> 02:17:00.880
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

3265
02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:05.290
<v Speaker 1>every single one of us listening to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>has had sex with someone or done drugs</v>

3266
02:17:05.291 --> 02:17:07.450
<v Speaker 1>with someone or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woke up the next morning and be like,</v>

3267
02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:09.460
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have done that Jamie.</v>

3268
02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3269
02:17:12.430 --> 02:17:16.090
<v Speaker 1>except here's my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about driving.</v>

3270
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:17.530
<v Speaker 1>If you drive in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're drunk.</v>

3271
02:17:17.531 --> 02:17:19.990
<v Speaker 1>No one says you're exonerated because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're drunk,</v>

3272
02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:21.851
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3273
02:17:21.851 --> 02:17:24.400
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are drunk and fucked up and you did</v>

3274
02:17:24.401 --> 02:17:26.620
<v Speaker 1>something drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're responsible for your actions.</v>

3275
02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:30.160
<v Speaker 1>But if you have sex drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden for some strange reason,</v>

3276
02:17:30.161 --> 02:17:32.410
<v Speaker 1>you're not responsible for your actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's preposterous.</v>

3277
02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:34.900
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't match up.</v>

3278
02:17:34.930 --> 02:17:36.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

3279
02:17:36.190 --> 02:17:36.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

3280
02:17:36.791 --> 02:17:39.550
<v Speaker 1>this is where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the identity politics of all this ruins</v>

3281
02:17:39.551 --> 02:17:41.410
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're not saying that anyone</v>

3282
02:17:41.411 --> 02:17:42.970
<v Speaker 1>that gets drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying if a girl really,</v>

3283
02:17:42.971 --> 02:17:45.410
<v Speaker 1>although that one example that you gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>is true.</v>

3284
02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:48.070
<v Speaker 1>That's like a curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a complete throw away.</v>

3285
02:17:48.071 --> 02:17:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shows you how fucking stupid the</v>

3286
02:17:50.201 --> 02:17:54.070
<v Speaker 1>university is that they let that fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should've smacked him.</v>

3287
02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Send it back to class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smack him in the face.</v>

3288
02:17:56.410 --> 02:17:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sun right back to class.</v>

3289
02:17:57.400 --> 02:17:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations Buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got laid.</v>

3290
02:17:59.350 --> 02:18:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>

3291
02:18:00.461 --> 02:18:02.590
<v Speaker 1>You were drunk and the girl took</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of your penis.</v>

3292
02:18:02.890 --> 02:18:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Did you orgasm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>

3293
02:18:04.211 --> 02:18:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get out of here.</v>

3294
02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:08.670
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3295
02:18:09.070 --> 02:18:10.330
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Across the board.</v>

3296
02:18:10.331 --> 02:18:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a far more ridiculous though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a guy is accusing,</v>

3297
02:18:13.481 --> 02:18:17.380
<v Speaker 1>and let's just be honest about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's far more ridiculous when a guy is</v>

3298
02:18:17.381 --> 02:18:19.660
<v Speaker 1>accusing a girl of rape in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>

3299
02:18:19.930 --> 02:18:22.930
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to hear all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive nonsense screaming and</v>

3300
02:18:22.931 --> 02:18:24.280
<v Speaker 1>yelling and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

3301
02:18:24.281 --> 02:18:26.320
<v Speaker 1>We're all equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

3302
02:18:26.770 --> 02:18:29.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same of a guy does that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a girl.</v>

3303
02:18:29.591 --> 02:18:33.490
<v Speaker 1>If a guy purposely gets a girl drunk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it because he knows that she</v>

3304
02:18:33.491 --> 02:18:36.200
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't consent any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then gets her department.</v>

3305
02:18:36.250 --> 02:18:37.240
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3306
02:18:37.241 --> 02:18:39.250
<v Speaker 1>and she's barely conscious and fucks</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

3307
02:18:39.370 --> 02:18:39.970
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion.</v>

3308
02:18:39.970 --> 02:18:40.803
<v Speaker 1>That's rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3309
02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:44.110
<v Speaker 1>and my opinion that that person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if a couple gets together and they</v>

3310
02:18:44.111 --> 02:18:45.520
<v Speaker 1>have a few drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're laughing,</v>

3311
02:18:45.521 --> 02:18:47.710
<v Speaker 1>they're flirting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they make out and then they go back</v>

3312
02:18:47.711 --> 02:18:49.630
<v Speaker 1>to her place or his place and they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

3313
02:18:49.930 --> 02:18:51.610
<v Speaker 1>It's not rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know it's not rape.</v>

3314
02:18:51.770 --> 02:18:53.290
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's split the difference on that</v>

3315
02:18:53.291 --> 02:18:54.041
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now it's a,</v>

3316
02:18:54.041 --> 02:18:55.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a sorority party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In College,</v>

3317
02:18:55.900 --> 02:18:59.710
<v Speaker 1>the girls decide they're going to drop</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ruthie's in a couple of the guys' things</v>

3318
02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:01.830
<v Speaker 1>late at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girls are just,</v>

3319
02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:02.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just,</v>

3320
02:19:02.501 --> 02:19:03.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the girls look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3321
02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So girls look good,</v>

3322
02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:06.251
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3323
02:19:06.251 --> 02:19:09.100
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a bunch of hot chicks now there,</v>

3324
02:19:09.220 --> 02:19:10.480

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3325
02:19:10.481 --> 02:19:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure this has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is definitely never heard of it.</v>

3326
02:19:13.630 --> 02:19:15.730
<v Speaker 1>If you're sure it's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to have happened.</v>

3327
02:19:16.020 --> 02:19:18.490

3328
02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I got roof by a girl in</v>
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>

3329
02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm married to a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who knows what's going on.</v>

3330
02:19:23.950 --> 02:19:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know who did it.</v>

3339
02:19:41.841 --> 02:19:45.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't have much of a recollection of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it other than I remember I had like half</v>

3340
02:19:45.411 --> 02:19:47.690
<v Speaker 4>a beer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could not really think.</v>

3341
02:19:47.691 --> 02:19:50.360
<v Speaker 4>And I remember I couldn't stand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you realize something was wrong and</v>

3342
02:19:50.361 --> 02:19:52.790
<v Speaker 4>try to get it out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew something was wrong,</v>

3343
02:19:52.791 --> 02:19:56.630
<v Speaker 4>but your mind doesn't operate correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember I was Kinda,</v>

3344
02:19:56.631 --> 02:19:59.210
<v Speaker 4>I remember my friends were there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we were all like stoners at the</v>

3345
02:19:59.211 --> 02:20:00.170
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't even know that.</v>

3346
02:20:00.171 --> 02:20:03.570
<v Speaker 4>I was like thinking clearly like</v>
<v Speaker 4>something you don't realize fully.</v>

3347
02:20:03.570 --> 02:20:05.220
<v Speaker 4>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know something's not right,</v>

3348
02:20:05.221 --> 02:20:07.410
<v Speaker 4>but you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least what happened to me was I just</v>

3349
02:20:07.411 --> 02:20:09.120
<v Speaker 4>couldn't like put all the pieces</v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

3350
02:20:09.220 --> 02:20:11.660
<v Speaker 4>You get tested,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you find out what it was now?</v>

3351
02:20:11.880 --> 02:20:15.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember at one point just sitting on</v>

3352
02:20:15.121 --> 02:20:17.850
<v Speaker 4>a couch in the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember a very bright lamp light</v>

3353
02:20:17.851 --> 02:20:20.040
<v Speaker 4>above me out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no recollection of how I got home</v>

3354
02:20:20.041 --> 02:20:23.190
<v Speaker 4>or like any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it also makes 20 years roofing all</v>

3355
02:20:23.191 --> 02:20:24.530

<v Speaker 4>why wouldn't you think it's,</v>

3356
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:26.780
<v Speaker 4>how do you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hip and all something.</v>

3357
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:29.820
<v Speaker 4>How do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's just say Ruthie,</v>

3358
02:20:29.820 --> 02:20:31.350
<v Speaker 4>Ruthie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What makes you think it was that and not</v>

3359
02:20:31.351 --> 02:20:32.670
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh I don't know.</v>

3360
02:20:32.671 --> 02:20:33.840
<v Speaker 4>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well cause I didn't trip.</v>

3361
02:20:33.841 --> 02:20:34.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3362
02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:36.360
<v Speaker 4>I've tripped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done that stuff.</v>

3363
02:20:36.361 --> 02:20:39.000
<v Speaker 4>What does that other stuff that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>give or ge or something like that?</v>

3364
02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:41.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't think I was in like a k</v>

3365
02:20:41.201 --> 02:20:44.200
<v Speaker 4>hole or I've never done that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I was in that kind of</v>

3366
02:20:44.201 --> 02:20:45.100
<v Speaker 4>state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just in this,</v>

3367
02:20:45.101 --> 02:20:48.610
<v Speaker 4>like my body kind of couldn't move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3368
02:20:48.620 --> 02:20:52.490
<v Speaker 4>little aura kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bright light and like I kind of couldn't</v>

3369
02:20:52.491 --> 02:20:54.260
<v Speaker 4>think straight that that's the way I</v>
<v Speaker 4>would describe it.</v>

3370
02:20:54.261 --> 02:20:54.921
<v Speaker 4>But I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3371
02:20:54.921 --> 02:20:57.440
<v Speaker 4>I've done mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done most things that are out here.</v>

3372
02:20:57.500 --> 02:20:59.900
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't hallucinating in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3373
02:20:59.901 --> 02:21:01.610
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just playing that went out for a</v>

3374
02:21:01.611 --> 02:21:04.040
<v Speaker 4>second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If a girl did that to a guy,</v>

3375
02:21:04.670 --> 02:21:08.000
<v Speaker 4>managed to get him hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck them.</v>

3376
02:21:08.140 --> 02:21:10.110
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you think it's the same thing.</v>

3377
02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.070
<v Speaker 4>You walk it off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk it off policy.</v>

3378
02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:15.930
<v Speaker 4>Those are my four words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suck it up,</v>

3379
02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:16.930
<v Speaker 4>suck it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get off.</v>

3380
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:19.310
<v Speaker 4>You got you got laid.</v>

3381
02:21:19.950 --> 02:21:21.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not good.</v>

3382
02:21:21.150 --> 02:21:24.030
<v Speaker 5>It's definitely not good for anybody to</v>
<v Speaker 5>take advantage of someone's body and</v>

3383
02:21:24.060 --> 02:21:28.560
<v Speaker 5>particularly give them a drug and where</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can't Dev no control and then raped</v>

3384
02:21:28.561 --> 02:21:29.070
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3385
02:21:29.070 --> 02:21:31.470
<v Speaker 5>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If a girl does it to a guy,</v>

3386
02:21:31.471 --> 02:21:32.810
<v Speaker 5>it is the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She roof,</v>

3387
02:21:32.811 --> 02:21:35.460
<v Speaker 5>he's the guy and has sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And especially what if the guy has a</v>

3388
02:21:35.461 --> 02:21:38.310
<v Speaker 5>girlfriend and he doesn't want to have</v>
<v Speaker 5>sex with her or you know,</v>

3389
02:21:38.311 --> 02:21:41.160
<v Speaker 5>fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not attracted to her or he's gay</v>

3390
02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:43.770
<v Speaker 5>and you do that to him and he's repulsed</v>
<v Speaker 5>by it.</v>

3391
02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:44.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's right.</v>

3392
02:21:44.610 --> 02:21:45.443
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3393
02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:48.870
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now we're in the realm of Bill Cosby,</v>

3394
02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:51.450
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bill cosby situation is fucking</v>

3395
02:21:51.451 --> 02:21:52.330
<v Speaker 5>break,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3396
02:21:52.331 --> 02:21:53.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>100%.</v>

3397
02:21:53.310 --> 02:21:55.440
<v Speaker 5>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a big difference between that and a</v>

3398
02:21:55.441 --> 02:21:57.660
<v Speaker 5>couple that gets together and has a</v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of drinks.</v>

3399
02:21:57.750 --> 02:22:00.190
<v Speaker 5>Have you heard it from a gay</v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective,</v>

3400
02:22:00.191 --> 02:22:03.790
<v Speaker 5>like two gay guys getting drunk and</v>
<v Speaker 5>having sex and one of the guy's accusing</v>

3401
02:22:03.791 --> 02:22:05.530
<v Speaker 5>the other one of sexual assault because</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was drunk?</v>

3402
02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:06.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've definitely heard of the first part,</v>

3403
02:22:06.970 --> 02:22:08.600
<v Speaker 4>two gay guys getting drunk and</v>
<v Speaker 4>hepatitis.</v>

3404
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:10.840
<v Speaker 4>I've heard any of the events that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened a lot.</v>

3405
02:22:11.130 --> 02:22:13.230
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rape one,</v>

3406
02:22:13.330 --> 02:22:18.330
<v Speaker 5>I haven't heard it that I've heard so</v>
<v Speaker 5>many stories about a woman in this one</v>

3407
02:22:18.341 --> 02:22:21.460
<v Speaker 5>story about a man claiming that he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>sexually assaulted because they were</v>

3408
02:22:21.461 --> 02:22:23.310
<v Speaker 5>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never heard it about two gay guys.</v>

3409
02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:26.690
<v Speaker 4>I actually do know one of a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3410
02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:29.580
<v Speaker 4>that was given something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that gift that was given something.</v>

3411
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:33.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not two guys not willingly got drunk</v>

3412
02:22:33.181 --> 02:22:34.130
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3413
02:22:34.410 --> 02:22:37.410
<v Speaker 4>not that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely have people been given.</v>

3414
02:22:37.411 --> 02:22:40.770
<v Speaker 4>Sure can attack 100% that that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably just a guy thing.</v>

3415
02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:42.420
<v Speaker 4>Fucking dark thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

3416
02:22:42.450 --> 02:22:45.990
<v Speaker 4>that's a dark thing that people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to do that that caused me,</v>

3417
02:22:45.991 --> 02:22:48.010
<v Speaker 4>thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shook me to my fucking core.</v>

3418
02:22:48.390 --> 02:22:51.180
<v Speaker 4>The idea that this guy who was America's</v>
<v Speaker 4>sweetheart,</v>

3419
02:22:51.210 --> 02:22:54.660
<v Speaker 4>America's dad was possibly the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 4>series,</v>

3420
02:22:54.690 --> 02:22:58.590
<v Speaker 4>not the Russians or the greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of the worst serial rapists of</v>

3421
02:22:58.591 --> 02:23:00.300
<v Speaker 4>all time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if not the worst.</v>

3422
02:23:00.330 --> 02:23:01.890
<v Speaker 4>Did we we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time I came on,</v>

3423
02:23:01.891 --> 02:23:04.510
<v Speaker 4>we talked about cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the reason I got into comedy at</v>

3424
02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:08.130
<v Speaker 4>four years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was 1981 or 1982 maybe I was</v>

3425
02:23:08.131 --> 02:23:11.040
<v Speaker 4>five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw a bill cosby himself on HBO.</v>

3426
02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:15.390
<v Speaker 4>I remember sitting in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my family room buckled over and</v>

3427
02:23:15.391 --> 02:23:16.920
<v Speaker 4>laughing to the point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3428
02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:20.640
<v Speaker 4>when you just your whole body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you cannot pain in my stomach.</v>

3429
02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:22.950
<v Speaker 4>And I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be funny.</v>

3430
02:23:23.310 --> 02:23:28.310
<v Speaker 4>And now my comedy hero is basically the</v>
<v Speaker 4>biggest serial rapist of all time.</v>

3431
02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:29.760
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>

3432
02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:33.000
<v Speaker 4>I used to have cosby records hanging up</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my house even to three years ago,</v>

3433
02:23:33.001 --> 02:23:34.950
<v Speaker 4>and eventually as the story started</v>
<v Speaker 4>leaking out,</v>

3434
02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:38.100
<v Speaker 4>I have one of his great records and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at first I was like,</v>

3435
02:23:38.140 --> 02:23:40.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to leave it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it doesn't change my feelings about</v>

3436
02:23:40.591 --> 02:23:42.780
<v Speaker 4>him as a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I remember people would be</v>

3437
02:23:42.781 --> 02:23:43.740
<v Speaker 4>coming into my house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3438
02:23:43.741 --> 02:23:46.590
<v Speaker 4>you got gotta be over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should do you just take it and then</v>

3439
02:23:46.591 --> 02:23:49.560
<v Speaker 4>put bars over it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I should do.</v>

3440
02:23:49.710 --> 02:23:52.120
<v Speaker 4>I bet you that leave it up there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but bars over it.</v>

3441
02:23:52.140 --> 02:23:54.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might do this just so fucked.</v>

3442
02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:57.120
<v Speaker 4>Like how could he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how could he be that guy?</v>

3443
02:23:57.121 --> 02:24:00.870
<v Speaker 4>How could he be the guy who is so funny</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everybody loves them and also be the</v>

3444
02:24:00.871 --> 02:24:03.000
<v Speaker 4>guy that that drugs people and rape</v>
<v Speaker 4>some.</v>

3445
02:24:03.001 --> 02:24:04.740
<v Speaker 4>It's like what a dark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dark,</v>

3446
02:24:04.770 --> 02:24:06.030
<v Speaker 4>dark secret.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3447
02:24:06.031 --> 02:24:08.700
<v Speaker 4>I think Jordan would have a lot to say</v>
<v Speaker 4>on this stuff that we,</v>

3448
02:24:08.701 --> 02:24:12.870
<v Speaker 4>these inconsistencies that we live with</v>
<v Speaker 4>that often drive us and that,</v>

3449
02:24:12.990 --> 02:24:15.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did we find out that that,</v>

3450
02:24:15.330 --> 02:24:17.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people preaching about morals or</v>

3451
02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:20.730
<v Speaker 4>all the time are the same people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are doing all this weird shit or that</v>

3452
02:24:20.731 --> 02:24:23.370
<v Speaker 4>we've all done things that we're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>proud of or whatever it is.</v>

3453
02:24:23.371 --> 02:24:25.020
<v Speaker 4>And it's like that's part of being a</v>
<v Speaker 4>human.</v>

3454
02:24:25.050 --> 02:24:25.910
<v Speaker 4>It's just part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3455
02:24:26.110 --> 02:24:29.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about the evil,</v>

3456
02:24:29.390 --> 02:24:30.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who's doing this into his</v>

3457
02:24:30.810 --> 02:24:33.510
<v Speaker 4>fucking sixties he was doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he gets,</v>

3458
02:24:33.511 --> 02:24:34.440
<v Speaker 4>it becomes an addiction.</v>

3459
02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:36.720
<v Speaker 4>Like anything else like you or your</v>
<v Speaker 4>mind,</v>

3460
02:24:36.721 --> 02:24:39.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure people do studies on this about</v>

3461
02:24:40.020 --> 02:24:43.080
<v Speaker 4>what happens to the actual brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemistry when you're doing these things</v>

3462
02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:45.840
<v Speaker 4>that I would guess it has something to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do with the dopamine levels that are</v>

3463
02:24:45.841 --> 02:24:49.290
<v Speaker 4>released at the same time when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you know somebody's snorting coke</v>

3464
02:24:49.291 --> 02:24:51.300
<v Speaker 4>and doing whatever they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3465
02:24:51.330 --> 02:24:53.370
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is,</v>

3466
02:24:53.371 --> 02:24:56.010
<v Speaker 4>but it's just so stunning to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3467
02:24:56.310 --> 02:24:56.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3468
02:24:56.910 --> 02:24:58.620
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again this is,</v>

3469
02:24:58.750 --> 02:25:02.070
<v Speaker 4>it goes back to laws or there's a need</v>
<v Speaker 4>to protect people,</v>

3470
02:25:02.100 --> 02:25:04.170
<v Speaker 4>but there's also a need to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3471
02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:08.550
<v Speaker 4>college boy who got drunk and had sex</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a girl who was also drunk.</v>

3472
02:25:08.551 --> 02:25:10.830
<v Speaker 4>He didn't get raped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck off.</v>

3473
02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:13.470
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really disrespectful to people that</v>

3474
02:25:13.471 --> 02:25:15.280
<v Speaker 4>actually had been raped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3475
02:25:15.300 --> 02:25:17.400
<v Speaker 4>And I get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of funny that he's turning the</v>

3476
02:25:17.401 --> 02:25:21.180
<v Speaker 4>tables and he's doing it to her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there was a story,</v>

3477
02:25:21.181 --> 02:25:24.370
<v Speaker 4>part of the store was something about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she had done it to one of his friends.</v>

3478
02:25:24.370 --> 02:25:27.280
<v Speaker 5>She had said that to one of his friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's preemptively doing it because he</v>

3479
02:25:27.281 --> 02:25:28.870
<v Speaker 5>thought that she was gonna come after</v>
<v Speaker 5>him now.</v>

3480
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:30.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of it is that it's gross,</v>

3481
02:25:30.591 --> 02:25:31.990
<v Speaker 2>that it's all public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3482
02:25:31.991 --> 02:25:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Like everything has become so public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's part of the</v>

3483
02:25:35.211 --> 02:25:38.180
<v Speaker 2>problem all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who banged who in college?</v>

3484
02:25:38.181 --> 02:25:42.760
<v Speaker 2>The idea that that now is like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that gets written about and people</v>

3485
02:25:42.761 --> 02:25:44.360
<v Speaker 2>get interviewed on all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3486
02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:47.560
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that is kind of dangerous and</v>

3487
02:25:47.561 --> 02:25:51.520
<v Speaker 2>that's why I try all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think what you usually do is you</v>

3488
02:25:51.521 --> 02:25:56.020
<v Speaker 2>usually talk about ideas not people</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it's the underlying philosophical</v>

3489
02:25:56.021 --> 02:25:58.630
<v Speaker 2>ideas that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not the specifics of this kid.</v>

3490
02:25:58.631 --> 02:26:01.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean you didn't pull up the picture of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kid and mentioned the girl's name</v>

3491
02:26:01.721 --> 02:26:04.420
<v Speaker 2>and hers are twitter and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that it's the underlying</v>

3492
02:26:04.421 --> 02:26:06.610
<v Speaker 2>philosophical issues of why are we doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

3493
02:26:06.611 --> 02:26:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Why are we exposing everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we attacking and destroying</v>

3494
02:26:09.581 --> 02:26:10.960
<v Speaker 2>everybody and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

3495
02:26:10.961 --> 02:26:15.180
<v Speaker 2>that's much more interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then just the specifics of the people or</v>

3496
02:26:15.450 --> 02:26:18.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the people that I'm so sick of all</v>

3497
02:26:18.061 --> 02:26:20.120
<v Speaker 2>these blue check writers and buzzfeed</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3498
02:26:20.130 --> 02:26:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Like I never called them out</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically like that guy.</v>

3499
02:26:22.931 --> 02:26:25.470
<v Speaker 2>I hate that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause like he,</v>

3500
02:26:25.500 --> 02:26:28.790
<v Speaker 2>that guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody during the business of writing.</v>

3501
02:26:28.791 --> 02:26:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3502
02:26:28.910 --> 02:26:30.260
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of it is,</v>

3503
02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:33.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean we can decide that these people</v>
<v Speaker 5>are enemy,</v>

3504
02:26:33.321 --> 02:26:37.460
<v Speaker 5>but like we're in some ways photos on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the battlefield.</v>

3505
02:26:38.090 --> 02:26:39.010
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

3506
02:26:39.050 --> 02:26:41.360
<v Speaker 5>in a very perverse way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a very perverse way,</v>

3507
02:26:41.380 --> 02:26:45.420
<v Speaker 5>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think it's just like their job is</v>

3508
02:26:45.421 --> 02:26:49.080
<v Speaker 5>to write about things and when we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>involved in a story,</v>

3509
02:26:49.530 --> 02:26:53.460
<v Speaker 5>they find an angle and they go after it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like I do with jokes.</v>

3510
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:56.420
<v Speaker 5>Like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I crack a joke about somebody else,</v>

3511
02:26:56.510 --> 02:27:00.090
<v Speaker 5>I do a bit about someone else hate them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I had this whole bit about,</v>

3512
02:27:00.091 --> 02:27:02.460
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bruce Jenner and the Kardashians.</v>

3513
02:27:02.461 --> 02:27:05.490
<v Speaker 5>What led bruce to become a woman because</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hated him.</v>

3514
02:27:05.690 --> 02:27:07.350
<v Speaker 5>It's cause it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was funny.</v>

3515
02:27:07.370 --> 02:27:09.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought is there's an angle there.</v>

3516
02:27:09.090 --> 02:27:11.760
<v Speaker 5>It's a story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a big thing that's on people's</v>

3517
02:27:11.761 --> 02:27:12.330
<v Speaker 5>minds.</v>

3518
02:27:12.330 --> 02:27:17.280
<v Speaker 5>And so it became a target for me the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same way it is when a lot of these folks</v>

3519
02:27:17.281 --> 02:27:21.390
<v Speaker 5>write articles and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of them are in their twenties and</v>

3520
02:27:21.391 --> 02:27:24.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're idealistic or they're young and</v>

3521
02:27:24.001 --> 02:27:27.870
<v Speaker 5>evolving their thoughts and maybe they</v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't write that article five years</v>

3522
02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:29.940
<v Speaker 5>from now or 10 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

3523
02:27:29.941 --> 02:27:32.510
<v Speaker 5>And we don't think we have to take that</v>
<v Speaker 5>into consideration as well.</v>

3524
02:27:32.530 --> 02:27:36.390
<v Speaker 5>These people are embarking on a career</v>
<v Speaker 5>in journalism and you know,</v>

3525
02:27:36.450 --> 02:27:40.830
<v Speaker 5>for a lot of them shitting on Jordan</v>
<v Speaker 5>Peterson gets them social brownie</v>

3526
02:27:40.831 --> 02:27:41.664
<v Speaker 5>points.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3527
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:42.833
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3528
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:44.850
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to shift topics for sure.</v>

3529
02:27:44.851 --> 02:27:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Can we do a little mid shift there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3530
02:27:46.670 --> 02:27:48.840
<v Speaker 2>We can do a little mid ship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was talking to Jordan about</v>

3531
02:27:48.841 --> 02:27:51.750
<v Speaker 2>something that I think is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting that I haven't talked about</v>

3532
02:27:51.751 --> 02:27:53.790
<v Speaker 2>publicly before and I thought if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to come on Joe Rogan,</v>

3533
02:27:53.820 --> 02:27:56.370
<v Speaker 2>let me see if I can bust out something</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of personal.</v>

3534
02:27:56.670 --> 02:27:59.130
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan was having all these autoimmune</v>

3535
02:27:59.131 --> 02:28:01.530
<v Speaker 2>problems and that's kind of what led him</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

3536
02:28:01.890 --> 02:28:04.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to doing this crazy diet where he in</v>

3537
02:28:04.261 --> 02:28:06.280
<v Speaker 2>effect is on the carnivore diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3538
02:28:06.290 --> 02:28:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it feel doing that.</v>

3539
02:28:09.870 --> 02:28:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks so much better.</v>

3540
02:28:11.730 --> 02:28:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Even even then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably last time he was here,</v>

3541
02:28:13.741 --> 02:28:15.210
<v Speaker 2>maybe what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four or five months ago,</v>

3542
02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:15.910
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3543
02:28:15.910 --> 02:28:17.370
<v Speaker 2>his skin looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks,</v>

3544
02:28:17.371 --> 02:28:18.720
<v Speaker 2>he's got some color back in his face.</v>

3545
02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:20.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's definitely lost some weight,</v>

3546
02:28:20.011 --> 02:28:21.050
<v Speaker 2>slimmed down a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3547
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:23.240
<v Speaker 2>but in a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His energy,</v>

3548
02:28:23.241 --> 02:28:24.560
<v Speaker 2>his back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3549
02:28:24.610 --> 02:28:25.940
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his hair looks better.</v>

3550
02:28:25.941 --> 02:28:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Like he just looks better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know all the science behind</v>

3551
02:28:29.361 --> 02:28:32.540
<v Speaker 2>the carnivore diet of whether you can do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it forever and not eat vegetables and</v>

3552
02:28:32.541 --> 02:28:34.610
<v Speaker 2>truly survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where you're getting the</v>

3553
02:28:34.611 --> 02:28:37.340
<v Speaker 2>rest of the nutrition that you need and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the vitamins and all that.</v>

3554
02:28:37.341 --> 02:28:39.140
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I've gone out to dinner with</v>

3555
02:28:39.141 --> 02:28:41.960
<v Speaker 2>him over these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy gets a freaking the biggest steak</v>

3556
02:28:41.961 --> 02:28:45.290
<v Speaker 2>you can imagine at every place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chops it up,</v>

3557
02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:46.700
<v Speaker 2>eats meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

3558
02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

3559
02:28:48.091 --> 02:28:51.890
<v Speaker 2>so we were talking the other day in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>green room before the show that it's</v>

3560
02:28:51.891 --> 02:28:56.840
<v Speaker 2>interesting that he had this health</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem as his success was growing and</v>

3561
02:28:56.841 --> 02:28:59.900
<v Speaker 2>it's like you don't really think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in life because we all like to</v>

3562
02:28:59.901 --> 02:29:03.740
<v Speaker 2>think like as we're growing and getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>better and doing what we're supposed to</v>

3563
02:29:03.741 --> 02:29:05.480
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our health is kind of in line with</v>

3564
02:29:05.481 --> 02:29:06.110
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3565
02:29:06.110 --> 02:29:07.640
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually never talked about this</v>

3566
02:29:07.641 --> 02:29:10.130
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but about two and a half years ago,</v>

3567
02:29:10.131 --> 02:29:12.260
<v Speaker 2>right when my show was really taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

3568
02:29:12.470 --> 02:29:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I think probably about the first time</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3569
02:29:13.860 --> 02:29:16.940
<v Speaker 2>we did our first sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so not the one last year but two in</v>

3570
02:29:16.941 --> 02:29:21.260
<v Speaker 2>about two and half years ago as I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>for also first getting hate online at</v>

3571
02:29:21.261 --> 02:29:25.040
<v Speaker 2>the same time I started losing tons of</v>
<v Speaker 2>chunks of hair,</v>

3572
02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:27.490
<v Speaker 2>tons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd be in the shower.</v>

3573
02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And tons of hair would be everywhere</v>

3574
02:29:29.721 --> 02:29:34.721
<v Speaker 2>after I showered hair in my towels and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and lost like huge patches</v>

3575
02:29:34.731 --> 02:29:36.470
<v Speaker 2>back of my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up top,</v>

3576
02:29:36.740 --> 02:29:40.100
<v Speaker 2>like all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had a al or I have,</v>

3577
02:29:40.101 --> 02:29:43.610
<v Speaker 2>I guess I technically still have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alopecia areata where it's an autoimmune</v>

3578
02:29:43.611 --> 02:29:45.080
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know why your white blood</v>

3579
02:29:45.081 --> 02:29:47.840
<v Speaker 2>cells start attacking your hair</v>
<v Speaker 2>follicles.</v>

3580
02:29:48.100 --> 02:29:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went about two years ago and again,</v>

3581
02:29:50.571 --> 02:29:52.970
<v Speaker 2>this is just as I'm like starting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>really succeed.</v>

3582
02:29:52.970 --> 02:29:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm really just like breaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>through for the first time.</v>

3583
02:29:55.850 --> 02:29:59.600
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went on this like crazy experimental</v>

3584
02:29:59.601 --> 02:30:01.370
<v Speaker 2>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So usually when you have this,</v>

3585
02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:05.240
<v Speaker 2>they just shoot cortisone into your</v>
<v Speaker 2>cortico corticosteroids into your head</v>

3586
02:30:05.241 --> 02:30:09.320
<v Speaker 2>and they hope that that basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>reverses it or stops or whatever reduces</v>

3587
02:30:09.321 --> 02:30:12.020
<v Speaker 2>the inflammation that's causing us</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

3588
02:30:12.021 --> 02:30:15.510
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my case was so severe that I went</v>

3589
02:30:15.511 --> 02:30:16.880
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found this doctor who's doing this</v>

3590
02:30:16.881 --> 02:30:18.470
<v Speaker 2>really experimental thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in effect,</v>

3591
02:30:18.471 --> 02:30:23.450
<v Speaker 2>they're putting something like poison</v>
<v Speaker 2>ivy on your head so that your white</v>

3592
02:30:23.451 --> 02:30:26.720
<v Speaker 2>blood cells will attack that instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking your hair follicles.</v>

3593
02:30:26.721 --> 02:30:30.740
<v Speaker 2>And the hope is if you do just the</v>
<v Speaker 2>slight amount that's necessary that you</v>

3594
02:30:30.741 --> 02:30:33.140
<v Speaker 2>won't have like crazy reactions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be,</v>

3595
02:30:33.141 --> 02:30:35.330
<v Speaker 2>and your hair eventually grow back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

3596
02:30:35.420 --> 02:30:39.560
<v Speaker 2>I did it for about a year and first off</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was on camera,</v>

3597
02:30:39.561 --> 02:30:41.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean there were points where like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

3598
02:30:41.121 --> 02:30:42.050
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't,</v>

3599
02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:43.060
<v Speaker 2>I can't be on academy more.</v>

3600
02:30:43.070 --> 02:30:46.550
<v Speaker 2>I was doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not spray hair but like powdered shit</v>

3601
02:30:46.551 --> 02:30:49.670
<v Speaker 2>and like grew out my hair to like hide</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that we'll later I can show you.</v>

3602
02:30:49.671 --> 02:30:51.380
<v Speaker 2>Like I still actually do have some spots</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

3603
02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway I went under this</v>

3604
02:30:53.420 --> 02:30:57.530
<v Speaker 2>experimental stuff and literally for two</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

3605
02:30:57.590 --> 02:31:01.190
<v Speaker 2>virtually my entire body was broken out</v>
<v Speaker 2>like red,</v>

3606
02:31:01.220 --> 02:31:02.570
<v Speaker 2>itchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gross,</v>

3607
02:31:02.571 --> 02:31:04.300
<v Speaker 2>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My head was like,</v>

3608
02:31:04.540 --> 02:31:06.080
<v Speaker 2>like terrific years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3609
02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:11.030
<v Speaker 2>for like a year bad and then and then a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year not as bad but like Ge,</v>

3610
02:31:11.070 --> 02:31:13.790
<v Speaker 2>like oozing my head like as if you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>poison ivy.</v>

3611
02:31:13.791 --> 02:31:18.791
<v Speaker 2>I was literally basically putting poison</v>
<v Speaker 2>ivy on my head and like I was sensitive</v>

3612
02:31:19.831 --> 02:31:24.500
<v Speaker 2>to heat and light and like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a truly misery.</v>

3613
02:31:24.520 --> 02:31:27.000
<v Speaker 2>I had like a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh I gained weight because of it.</v>

3614
02:31:27.001 --> 02:31:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Cause it likes screws up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like my,</v>

3615
02:31:29.180 --> 02:31:30.720
<v Speaker 2>my neck actually look thicker.</v>

3616
02:31:30.720 --> 02:31:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Like I look at videos where I did not</v>
<v Speaker 2>look good for a year.</v>

3617
02:31:33.930 --> 02:31:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Like I look kind of bloated because my</v>
<v Speaker 2>body was basically having like an</v>

3618
02:31:37.381 --> 02:31:41.070
<v Speaker 2>allergic reaction at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was putting something on my head to</v>

3619
02:31:41.071 --> 02:31:44.130
<v Speaker 2>cause my body to have an allergic</v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction like it for whatever reason I</v>

3620
02:31:44.131 --> 02:31:46.050
<v Speaker 2>was just very sensitive to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

3621
02:31:46.051 --> 02:31:48.090
<v Speaker 2>I bring this all up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Cause I've never talked about it and</v>

3622
02:31:48.091 --> 02:31:50.910
<v Speaker 2>I thought it would might just be</v>
<v Speaker 2>something to like throw out there.</v>

3623
02:31:51.210 --> 02:31:53.850
<v Speaker 2>But B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've discussed with Jordan is just</v>

3624
02:31:53.851 --> 02:31:57.570
<v Speaker 2>this interesting idea of sort of as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're succeeding and as you're doing</v>

3625
02:31:57.571 --> 02:32:01.050
<v Speaker 2>what you're supposed to be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that life just throws you weird things.</v>

3626
02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:02.880
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty much over it now.</v>

3627
02:32:02.881 --> 02:32:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I definitely have some stuff still</v>

3628
02:32:05.011 --> 02:32:05.844
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3629
02:32:05.850 --> 02:32:08.190
<v Speaker 2>now I'm just taking the injections and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see what happens.</v>

3630
02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't you think it's stress related?</v>

3631
02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd really Jordan doing the float</v>

3632
02:32:13.201 --> 02:32:14.520
<v Speaker 2>tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm doing the Saunas.</v>

3633
02:32:14.521 --> 02:32:16.350
<v Speaker 2>I get massages every couple of weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

3634
02:32:16.380 --> 02:32:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely trying.</v>

3635
02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:21.270
<v Speaker 2>That's why I did the month off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan was not famous his whole life</v>

3636
02:32:21.290 --> 02:32:24.000
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in his fifties became famous.</v>

3637
02:32:24.390 --> 02:32:28.530
<v Speaker 2>That is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a not a normal state that people</v>

3638
02:32:28.531 --> 02:32:31.770
<v Speaker 2>are accustomed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even a clinical psychologist and a</v>

3639
02:32:31.771 --> 02:32:35.490
<v Speaker 2>professor and a professor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3640
02:32:35.550 --> 02:32:36.810
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3641
02:32:36.811 --> 02:32:40.620
<v Speaker 2>how many stories do we have to read</v>
<v Speaker 2>about people who go famous and lose</v>

3642
02:32:40.621 --> 02:32:41.860
<v Speaker 2>their fucking marbles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3643
02:32:41.880 --> 02:32:43.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not an easy road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

3644
02:32:43.710 --> 02:32:45.840
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy to handle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People ask him about that.</v>

3645
02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.960
<v Speaker 2>So when we do the q and a at the end</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an APP that people submit</v>

3646
02:32:48.961 --> 02:32:50.730
<v Speaker 2>questions and then I just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>moderate it.</v>

3647
02:32:50.731 --> 02:32:52.740
<v Speaker 2>So I picked some funny ones and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>picked some serious ones.</v>

3648
02:32:52.740 --> 02:32:55.140
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of the questions are asked him</v>
<v Speaker 2>directly about that,</v>

3649
02:32:55.530 --> 02:32:58.170
<v Speaker 2>about what it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what pressure do you feel now that</v>

3650
02:32:58.171 --> 02:32:59.010
<v Speaker 2>you're famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

3651
02:32:59.020 --> 02:33:01.180
<v Speaker 2>what if you screw up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if a lot,</v>

3652
02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:03.770
<v Speaker 2>you know they also ask them what lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is a great question and,</v>

3653
02:33:03.771 --> 02:33:06.210
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to paraphrase his</v>
<v Speaker 2>answer because I won't do it justice,</v>

3654
02:33:06.600 --> 02:33:07.530
<v Speaker 2>but they ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3655
02:33:07.531 --> 02:33:09.780
<v Speaker 2>you talk about religion and archetypes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that,</v>

3656
02:33:09.810 --> 02:33:12.300
<v Speaker 2>are you a profit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will ask him now,</v>

3657
02:33:12.301 --> 02:33:13.920
<v Speaker 2>not because they're saying he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>prophet,</v>

3658
02:33:13.921 --> 02:33:16.470
<v Speaker 2>but like if you believe in all of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

3659
02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:18.510
<v Speaker 2>if you believe that product you factor</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3660
02:33:18.550 --> 02:33:19.430
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

3661
02:33:19.431 --> 02:33:21.570
<v Speaker 2>he goes out of his way to say he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that.</v>

3662
02:33:21.571 --> 02:33:23.350
<v Speaker 2>And he's not trying to make anyone drink</v>
<v Speaker 2>koolaid.</v>

3663
02:33:23.351 --> 02:33:26.360
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to help have them live the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best life for themself,</v>

3664
02:33:26.370 --> 02:33:28.140
<v Speaker 2>not in life that he's laying out for</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3665
02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3666
02:33:30.330 --> 02:33:32.790
<v Speaker 2>but watching him go through all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just been,</v>

3667
02:33:33.420 --> 02:33:35.910
<v Speaker 2>it's been truly fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it really,</v>

3668
02:33:35.911 --> 02:33:37.890
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I think I said it before,</v>

3669
02:33:37.891 --> 02:33:39.840
<v Speaker 2>but it like the whole thing is like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>love fest.</v>

3670
02:33:39.841 --> 02:33:44.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not what they want it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the people that are writing all</v>

3671
02:33:44.321 --> 02:33:47.250
<v Speaker 2>of these pieces and who often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I invite a lot of the writers sometimes</v>

3672
02:33:47.251 --> 02:33:48.120
<v Speaker 2>that right things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like,</v>

3673
02:33:48.121 --> 02:33:50.910
<v Speaker 2>you want to come to the show tonight at</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of them are welcome to come as my</v>

3674
02:33:50.911 --> 02:33:52.230
<v Speaker 2>guests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can sit right up front.</v>

3675
02:33:52.231 --> 02:33:53.640
<v Speaker 2>I'll do the exact same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan.</v>

3676
02:33:53.641 --> 02:33:55.230
<v Speaker 2>We'll do the exact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know what's good about those</v>

3677
02:33:55.231 --> 02:33:58.140
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's good about is the same thing that</v>

3678
02:33:58.141 --> 02:34:01.650
<v Speaker 2>I try to do with all my material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at it and I learned this from</v>

3679
02:34:01.651 --> 02:34:02.461
<v Speaker 2>Doug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stan hope,</v>

3680
02:34:02.461 --> 02:34:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Doug Stan hope actually said it to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I realized I kind of do it,</v>

3681
02:34:05.281 --> 02:34:08.100
<v Speaker 2>but from him saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it more.</v>

3682
02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:12.780
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should write your bits as if you're</v>

3683
02:34:12.781 --> 02:34:16.290
<v Speaker 2>a defense attorney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're defending your bit like</v>

3684
02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:18.160
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your bit like as if</v>

3685
02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:19.710
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so I,</v>

3686
02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:24.640
<v Speaker 5>I think that one of the things about</v>
<v Speaker 5>having haters out there or critics out</v>

3687
02:34:24.641 --> 02:34:26.710
<v Speaker 5>there is that they're examining your</v>
<v Speaker 5>material,</v>

3688
02:34:26.711 --> 02:34:30.100
<v Speaker 5>finding holes in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think if you go over all of your</v>

3689
02:34:30.101 --> 02:34:34.910
<v Speaker 5>material and all of your ideas from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective of someone is watching,</v>

3690
02:34:34.911 --> 02:34:37.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm right now trying to find fault in</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything that you do.</v>

3691
02:34:37.990 --> 02:34:40.030
<v Speaker 5>You will find it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just be undeniable.</v>

3692
02:34:40.060 --> 02:34:41.410
<v Speaker 5>Just be undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Find,</v>

3693
02:34:41.411 --> 02:34:43.150
<v Speaker 5>find those holes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>patch him up.</v>

3694
02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:45.430
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be disagreements.</v>

3695
02:34:45.431 --> 02:34:49.140
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you're always going to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>able to state your point and it's going</v>

3696
02:34:49.141 --> 02:34:49.980
<v Speaker 5>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3697
02:34:50.110 --> 02:34:53.320
<v Speaker 5>undeniable to someone who completely</v>
<v Speaker 5>disagrees,</v>

3698
02:34:53.860 --> 02:34:56.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ideologically with your stance on</v>

3699
02:34:56.441 --> 02:34:57.550
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But no,</v>

3700
02:34:57.551 --> 02:34:59.770
<v Speaker 5>as long as you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's undeniable to you,</v>

3701
02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:00.760
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've,</v>

3702
02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:04.210
<v Speaker 5>you've rationally made your case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've objectively stated the facts.</v>

3703
02:35:04.211 --> 02:35:04.600
<v Speaker 5>You've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've,</v>

3704
02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:06.910
<v Speaker 5>this is your position and this is why.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you could back it up.</v>

3705
02:35:07.270 --> 02:35:10.960
<v Speaker 5>There's too much sloppy work going on</v>
<v Speaker 5>where people think they can and you see</v>

3706
02:35:10.961 --> 02:35:14.260
<v Speaker 5>this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot on the progressive left or</v>

3707
02:35:14.261 --> 02:35:15.880
<v Speaker 5>the regressive left or what do you want</v>
<v Speaker 5>to call it,</v>

3708
02:35:15.881 --> 02:35:19.690
<v Speaker 5>where they just expect that other people</v>
<v Speaker 5>are just going to agree with their</v>

3709
02:35:19.691 --> 02:35:20.980
<v Speaker 5>stance on things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they,</v>

3710
02:35:21.070 --> 02:35:22.480
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have this sort of</v>

3711
02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:27.300
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this very rigid ideology that they're,</v>

3712
02:35:27.301 --> 02:35:30.130
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to put out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They often think that they're morally</v>

3713
02:35:30.131 --> 02:35:30.590
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3714
02:35:30.590 --> 02:35:32.920
<v Speaker 4>So then you don't have to do the leg</v>
<v Speaker 4>work of the arguments.</v>

3715
02:35:32.980 --> 02:35:37.330
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot harder to take a position</v>
<v Speaker 4>that says you should be who you are and</v>

3716
02:35:37.331 --> 02:35:40.000
<v Speaker 4>you have to fit that into society rather</v>
<v Speaker 4>than saying,</v>

3717
02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:44.770
<v Speaker 4>this is what the moral imperative is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is why we need those laws.</v>

3718
02:35:44.771 --> 02:35:47.110
<v Speaker 4>And if you deviate from that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're the bad guy.</v>

3719
02:35:47.111 --> 02:35:49.960
<v Speaker 4>So unfortunately they've just embraced</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3720
02:35:50.170 --> 02:35:52.090
<v Speaker 4>I think too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

3721
02:35:52.091 --> 02:35:54.700
<v Speaker 4>it's like one of those things like when</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go to these colleges and I'm usually</v>

3722
02:35:54.701 --> 02:35:59.140
<v Speaker 4>invited by libertarians and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>the returns want low taxes and limited</v>

3723
02:35:59.141 --> 02:36:00.580
<v Speaker 4>government and live how you want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>live.</v>

3724
02:36:00.610 --> 02:36:01.030
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That.</v>

3725
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:03.460
<v Speaker 4>That's the basics of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they'll often say,</v>

3726
02:36:03.461 --> 02:36:05.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I talk about low taxes in a college</v>

3727
02:36:05.471 --> 02:36:07.030
<v Speaker 4>class and people say I'm racist.</v>

3728
02:36:07.450 --> 02:36:08.170
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3729
02:36:08.170 --> 02:36:12.310
<v Speaker 4>how does race get into that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what they will say is that what</v>

3730
02:36:12.311 --> 02:36:12.971
<v Speaker 4>they'll say is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3731
02:36:12.971 --> 02:36:14.410
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want low taxes,</v>

3732
02:36:14.411 --> 02:36:18.130
<v Speaker 4>that means you don't want money going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who need it more.</v>

3733
02:36:18.131 --> 02:36:20.920
<v Speaker 4>And often it is people of color who need</v>
<v Speaker 4>it more.</v>

3734
02:36:20.921 --> 02:36:25.750
<v Speaker 4>So you inherently are racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to think on how to make the</v>

3735
02:36:25.751 --> 02:36:26.820
<v Speaker 4>counter argument to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

3736
02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:29.260
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a very valid counter</v>
<v Speaker 4>argument that I buy into,</v>

3737
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:32.710
<v Speaker 4>but you have to think it's very easy to</v>
<v Speaker 4>just take somebody who thinks the</v>

3738
02:36:32.711 --> 02:36:34.390
<v Speaker 4>reverse of you and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're racist.</v>

3739
02:36:34.930 --> 02:36:39.040
<v Speaker 4>You're race such such a lazy way to</v>
<v Speaker 4>approach an idea.</v>

3740
02:36:39.100 --> 02:36:39.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3741
02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
<v Speaker 4>It's so lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing I,</v>

3742
02:36:42.001 --> 02:36:45.790
<v Speaker 4>I've a problem with what Jordan has been</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying lately is this idea of enforced</v>

3743
02:36:45.791 --> 02:36:50.791
<v Speaker 4>monogamy being the solution to insoles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these involuntary celibates that's not</v>

3744
02:36:51.101 --> 02:36:53.010
<v Speaker 4>going to help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what do you think the,</v>

3745
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:54.190
<v Speaker 4>I become men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3746
02:36:54.191 --> 02:36:56.410
<v Speaker 4>what do you think his definition of</v>
<v Speaker 4>enforcement argument is?</v>

3747
02:36:56.411 --> 02:36:59.590
<v Speaker 4>Just to be clear with the horse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>monogamy were people,</v>

3748
02:36:59.650 --> 02:37:00.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3749
02:37:00.670 --> 02:37:04.960
<v Speaker 4>the culture encourages and supports the</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea of monogamy.</v>

3750
02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:06.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In effect,</v>

3751
02:37:06.611 --> 02:37:08.620
<v Speaker 4>he's talking about Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just talking about marriage and</v>

3752
02:37:08.621 --> 02:37:10.030
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not going to clear that way</v>

3753
02:37:10.050 --> 02:37:12.840
<v Speaker 5>to people that no one wants to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not going to,</v>

3754
02:37:12.841 --> 02:37:15.860
<v Speaker 5>the idea is that there's a bunch of men</v>
<v Speaker 5>out there that are taking all the viable</v>

3755
02:37:15.861 --> 02:37:16.370
<v Speaker 5>females</v>

3756
02:37:16.370 --> 02:37:17.990
<v Speaker 3>because no one's getting married and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>

3757
02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:19.820
<v Speaker 3>there's no room for these insoles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3758
02:37:20.210 --> 02:37:24.770
<v Speaker 3>They are not attractive to women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they're not physically</v>

3759
02:37:24.771 --> 02:37:27.050
<v Speaker 3>attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told me Harvey Weinstein was</v>

3760
02:37:27.051 --> 02:37:29.330
<v Speaker 3>physically attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking disgusting pig.</v>

3761
02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Forget about what he did to those women</v>
<v Speaker 3>are the rapes or the sexual assaults.</v>

3762
02:37:33.230 --> 02:37:36.350
<v Speaker 3>He had a gorgeous wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His wife is gorgeous.</v>

3763
02:37:36.351 --> 02:37:38.720
<v Speaker 3>That was a voluntary relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3764
02:37:38.721 --> 02:37:41.300
<v Speaker 3>so how did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happened through success.</v>

3765
02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:44.420
<v Speaker 3>It happened through success and</v>
<v Speaker 3>confidence and whatever the fuck else</v>

3766
02:37:44.421 --> 02:37:47.660
<v Speaker 3>he's got intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what his mind's like.</v>

3767
02:37:48.020 --> 02:37:49.920
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these insoles,</v>

3768
02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:52.430
<v Speaker 3>they have to become men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3769
02:37:52.490 --> 02:37:54.260
<v Speaker 3>And there's a word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about that.</v>

3770
02:37:54.261 --> 02:37:57.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean his whole message is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think that enforced</v>

3771
02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:01.020
<v Speaker 3>monogamy has any factor whatsoever in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

3772
02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:02.630
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he would say this,</v>

3773
02:38:02.631 --> 02:38:06.590
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not as lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think he used the phrase all he</v>

3774
02:38:06.591 --> 02:38:07.520
<v Speaker 3>meant was marriage.</v>

3775
02:38:07.550 --> 02:38:11.300
<v Speaker 3>That generally societies that more</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are married and let's just say</v>

3776
02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:13.100
<v Speaker 3>married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think going to help.</v>

3777
02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:15.350
<v Speaker 3>I think perhaps if he was being</v>
<v Speaker 3>interviewed again by,</v>

3778
02:38:15.410 --> 02:38:17.210
<v Speaker 3>by her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would use a different phrase.</v>

3779
02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:18.830
<v Speaker 3>Even if they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if he says marriage,</v>

3780
02:38:18.831 --> 02:38:21.950
<v Speaker 3>marriage is not going to help in cells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys that are involuntary</v>

3781
02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:24.230
<v Speaker 3>celibate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to become attractive so they</v>

3782
02:38:24.231 --> 02:38:26.780
<v Speaker 3>have to become men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the rest of his messages about</v>

3783
02:38:26.781 --> 02:38:29.180
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have to do difficult things.</v>

3784
02:38:29.181 --> 02:38:30.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they have to do.</v>

3785
02:38:30.590 --> 02:38:32.300
<v Speaker 3>They have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to deal shit,</v>

3786
02:38:32.301 --> 02:38:34.070
<v Speaker 3>confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your shit together.</v>

3787
02:38:34.430 --> 02:38:37.220
<v Speaker 3>And martial arts I think is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best ways to do that.</v>

3788
02:38:37.221 --> 02:38:39.700
<v Speaker 3>I've seen so many men that were like</v>
<v Speaker 3>sick,</v>

3789
02:38:39.770 --> 02:38:44.770
<v Speaker 3>insecure and Dorky and w they become</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking nerd assassins through martial</v>

3790
02:38:45.141 --> 02:38:45.741
<v Speaker 3>arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it did.</v>

3791
02:38:45.741 --> 02:38:49.030
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a great way to build</v>
<v Speaker 3>confidence and I think there's an</v>

3792
02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:54.040
<v Speaker 3>extreme lack of adversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like physical adversity and a lot of</v>

3793
02:38:54.321 --> 02:38:55.154
<v Speaker 3>people's lives.</v>

3794
02:38:55.280 --> 02:38:58.640
<v Speaker 3>And overcoming physical adversity is</v>
<v Speaker 3>what leads to a lot of confidence in</v>

3795
02:38:58.641 --> 02:39:00.980
<v Speaker 3>men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just think that there's a lot of</v>

3796
02:39:00.981 --> 02:39:05.720
<v Speaker 3>men that are just have no idea whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can or can't do anything difficult.</v>

3797
02:39:05.721 --> 02:39:07.610
<v Speaker 3>And they have massive insecurity because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

3798
02:39:07.910 --> 02:39:10.880
<v Speaker 3>I think he would agree with every word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he went to everywhere that you</v>

3799
02:39:10.881 --> 02:39:11.880
<v Speaker 3>just said there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3800
02:39:11.900 --> 02:39:13.580
<v Speaker 3>I just think that marriage is not fixing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3801
02:39:13.660 --> 02:39:15.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>culturally enforced monogamy's not going</v>

3802
02:39:15.651 --> 02:39:19.640
<v Speaker 3>to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to become men and women was to</v>

3803
02:39:19.641 --> 02:39:21.800
<v Speaker 3>have a reason to want to have sex with</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3804
02:39:21.850 --> 02:39:22.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3805
02:39:22.930 --> 02:39:25.160
<v Speaker 3>So I think he would agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he would say that once you</v>

3806
02:39:25.161 --> 02:39:28.310
<v Speaker 3>accomplish that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's when you will find more</v>

3807
02:39:28.311 --> 02:39:32.060
<v Speaker 3>women and that the next step,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next natural progression in life is</v>

3808
02:39:32.061 --> 02:39:35.150
<v Speaker 3>that you will find someone that you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be partnered with and that that then</v>

3809
02:39:35.420 --> 02:39:37.610
<v Speaker 3>has the best value for our society.</v>

3810
02:39:38.030 --> 02:39:40.460
<v Speaker 3>But I don't want to completely state his</v>
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>

3811
02:39:40.510 --> 02:39:42.080
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting case,</v>

3812
02:39:42.260 --> 02:39:43.520
<v Speaker 3>but he completely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3813
02:39:43.521 --> 02:39:45.620
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it that for the little bit that</v>

3814
02:39:45.621 --> 02:39:48.740
<v Speaker 3>these articles get right about him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that he's helping men.</v>

3815
02:39:48.770 --> 02:39:49.770
<v Speaker 3>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

3816
02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:51.410
<v Speaker 3>He's also helping women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yes,</v>

3817
02:39:51.710 --> 02:39:54.530
<v Speaker 3>he is helping men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men need their shit together.</v>

3818
02:39:54.560 --> 02:39:56.300
<v Speaker 3>They need framework for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3819
02:39:56.301 --> 02:39:59.330
<v Speaker 3>people need this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing about discipline and you</v>

3820
02:39:59.331 --> 02:39:59.960
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3821
02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:00.690
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3822
02:40:00.690 --> 02:40:01.640
<v Speaker 3>are you aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3823
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:03.670
<v Speaker 3>you're aware of Jocko Jocko willink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3824
02:40:03.770 --> 02:40:07.580
<v Speaker 3>That discipline equals freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of the best catch phrases.</v>

3825
02:40:07.581 --> 02:40:09.020
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's empowering.</v>

3826
02:40:09.050 --> 02:40:12.260
<v Speaker 3>It's so empowering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get your shit together and then you,</v>

3827
02:40:12.261 --> 02:40:14.070
<v Speaker 3>the time that have for</v>

<v Speaker 5>recreation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll appreciate it so much more.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You're appreciate rest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you've worked hard,</v>

3831
02:40:22.260 --> 02:40:25.110
<v Speaker 5>that's when it means something to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you've accomplished goals,</v>

3832
02:40:25.111 --> 02:40:28.710
<v Speaker 5>that's when this celebration is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is something that you,</v>

3833
02:40:28.810 --> 02:40:31.710
<v Speaker 5>you get a good feeling from it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a part in your life that you</v>

3834

<v Speaker 5>feel like is lacking in that department?</v>
<v Speaker 5>In what department and just like getting</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3837
02:40:39.780 --> 02:40:40.950
<v Speaker 5>That's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3838
02:40:41.010 --> 02:40:42.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do a lot of shit.</v>

3839

<v Speaker 5>many different things as I do is if I</v>

3840

<v Speaker 5>just get after it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm not an insecure in that.</v>

3843
02:40:53.250 --> 02:40:55.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's through martial arts or any</v>

3844
02:40:55.771 --> 02:40:59.070

02:40:59.130 --> 02:41:01.260
<v Speaker 5>I take pride in getting things done.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I take pride in working,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>are important to me,</v>

3848
02:41:06.661 --> 02:41:09.610
<v Speaker 5>whether it's working on my set,</v>
<v Speaker 5>working on my stand up,</v>

3849
02:41:09.750 --> 02:41:13.950
<v Speaker 5>whether it's working on a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's working on my martial arts</v>

3850
02:41:13.951 --> 02:41:17.550
<v Speaker 5>or my fitness or yoga or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get after it.</v>

3851
02:41:17.551 --> 02:41:19.250
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did you got to?</v>

3852
02:41:19.270 --> 02:41:20.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and for me,</v>

3853
02:41:20.251 --> 02:41:22.530
<v Speaker 5>it's not a matter of whether or not it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>an option.</v>

3854
02:41:22.531 --> 02:41:25.590
<v Speaker 5>It's like brushing my teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't decide one day,</v>

3855
02:41:25.591 --> 02:41:27.390
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to brush my teeth today.</v>

3856
02:41:27.570 --> 02:41:31.740
<v Speaker 5>I just fucking brush my teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when there's days where I'm doing</v>

3857
02:41:31.741 --> 02:41:34.320
<v Speaker 5>fasted cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when that alarm goes off,</v>

3858
02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:37.290
<v Speaker 5>it's not a matter of whether or not a</v>
<v Speaker 5>shut the alarm off.</v>

3859
02:41:37.350 --> 02:41:39.660
<v Speaker 5>That's not an option.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You Get up,</v>

3860
02:41:39.780 --> 02:41:43.170
<v Speaker 5>you put your fucking shoes on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get the dog and you go running</v>

3861
02:41:43.171 --> 02:41:46.590
<v Speaker 5>because that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you just decide that's what you</v>

3862
02:41:46.591 --> 02:41:49.920
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you get things done and then a</v>

3863
02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:51.160
<v Speaker 5>month later you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh shit,</v>

3864
02:41:51.270 --> 02:41:54.990
<v Speaker 5>we did this all month and then six</v>
<v Speaker 5>months later it's like,</v>

3865
02:41:55.050 --> 02:41:56.970
<v Speaker 5>oh I did this half a year.</v>

3866
02:41:57.270 --> 02:41:59.400
<v Speaker 5>And then if you're doing Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

3867
02:41:59.401 --> 02:42:00.990
<v Speaker 5>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look I got a blue belt.</v>

3868
02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:02.940
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm a purple belt.</v>

3869
02:42:03.030 --> 02:42:05.280
<v Speaker 5>And that's how you become a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just,</v>

3870
02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:06.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I got my,</v>

3871
02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:09.930
<v Speaker 5>the good type of progressive cause it</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets progressively easier too.</v>

3872
02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:11.760
<v Speaker 5>I told you I'm doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't though.</v>

3873
02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:13.080
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't get easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't think so?</v>

3874
02:42:13.081 --> 02:42:15.960
<v Speaker 5>Cause it can hard every time that alarm</v>
<v Speaker 5>goes off like fuck.</v>

3875
02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:19.020
<v Speaker 5>But you for you now then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right when you started,</v>

3876
02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:22.140
<v Speaker 5>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know the reward of it,</v>

3877
02:42:22.170 --> 02:42:24.480
<v Speaker 5>you know that that reward is some</v>
<v Speaker 5>enforcement.</v>

3878
02:42:24.510 --> 02:42:26.820
<v Speaker 5>There's some enforcement in the success</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I've had in,</v>

3879
02:42:26.821 --> 02:42:30.780
<v Speaker 5>in completing these tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but every fucking time I go to yoga</v>

3880
02:42:30.781 --> 02:42:31.411
<v Speaker 5>class,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3881
02:42:31.411 --> 02:42:35.100
<v Speaker 5>oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>90 minutes in 104 degree temperature</v>

3882
02:42:35.101 --> 02:42:37.320
<v Speaker 5>with these all these women that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to humiliate me.</v>

3883
02:42:38.130 --> 02:42:40.230
<v Speaker 5>They can definitely do things that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't do.</v>

3884
02:42:40.980 --> 02:42:42.630
<v Speaker 5>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is their tough man.</v>

3885
02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:45.210
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of these older ladies that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are fucking tough.</v>

3886
02:42:45.230 --> 02:42:45.991
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3887
02:42:45.991 --> 02:42:48.270
<v Speaker 5>they just gut it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just one lady that goes there.</v>

3888
02:42:48.271 --> 02:42:51.150
<v Speaker 5>She's like 60 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She doesn't even bring water and this</v>

3889
02:42:51.151 --> 02:42:53.960
<v Speaker 5>lady's in there for 90 fucking minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sweat it out.</v>

3890
02:42:53.980 --> 02:42:55.400
<v Speaker 5>She's there every time I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3891
02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:56.910
<v Speaker 5>she's not bringing water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You sure?</v>

3892
02:42:56.911 --> 02:42:59.180
<v Speaker 5>She's 60 she could be like 20 and just</v>
<v Speaker 5>dehydrated.</v>

3893
02:43:00.220 --> 02:43:02.850
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's gray hair and tough as shit.</v>

3894
02:43:02.851 --> 02:43:04.770
<v Speaker 5>She drinks water before and she drinks</v>
<v Speaker 5>it after.</v>

3895
02:43:04.771 --> 02:43:06.810
<v Speaker 5>But when she's in that class,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's just tough.</v>

3896
02:43:07.350 --> 02:43:08.340
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3897
02:43:08.590 --> 02:43:10.620
<v Speaker 5>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's never easy to do.</v>

3898
02:43:10.740 --> 02:43:12.550
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gets a little bit easier when you get</v>

3899
02:43:12.551 --> 02:43:14.590
<v Speaker 5>better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then you just try harder and it</v>

3900
02:43:14.591 --> 02:43:15.610
<v Speaker 5>makes it more difficult.</v>

3901
02:43:15.610 --> 02:43:17.320
<v Speaker 5>If you're always giving a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 5>percent effort,</v>

3902
02:43:17.321 --> 02:43:19.120
<v Speaker 5>it's always going to be hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3903
02:43:19.121 --> 02:43:21.160
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you take some pride in the fact that now</v>

3904
02:43:21.161 --> 02:43:24.370
<v Speaker 5>I can go two miles through the hills and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3905
02:43:24.371 --> 02:43:27.520
<v Speaker 5>and reach the point of exhaustion where</v>
<v Speaker 5>before it was one or whatever,</v>

3906
02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:30.790
<v Speaker 5>whatever your little little progress</v>
<v Speaker 5>markers are,</v>

3907
02:43:30.791 --> 02:43:34.360
<v Speaker 5>you get some satisfaction that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's always difficult to get going.</v>

3908
02:43:34.361 --> 02:43:36.910
<v Speaker 5>The the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hardest step is the first step is</v>

3909
02:43:36.911 --> 02:43:40.420
<v Speaker 5>not the 30th step or the hundredth step.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the fucking first one.</v>

3910
02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:42.760
<v Speaker 5>It's getting on the trail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting going.</v>

3911
02:43:42.761 --> 02:43:45.400
<v Speaker 5>It's the hardest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The hardest weight to lift is the first</v>

3912
02:43:45.401 --> 02:43:48.010
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause once you get going like okay,</v>

3913
02:43:48.011 --> 02:43:50.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm a half hour into my workout,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm writing things down.</v>

3914
02:43:50.190 --> 02:43:51.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm supposed to be doing now I got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3915
02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:54.850
<v Speaker 5>20 Chin ups,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then burpees and then all these days you</v>

3916
02:43:54.851 --> 02:43:57.400
<v Speaker 5>have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just have to do it.</v>

3917
02:43:57.430 --> 02:43:59.500
<v Speaker 5>And so many people have a hard time</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing it.</v>

3918
02:43:59.550 --> 02:44:00.840
<v Speaker 5>If read in moving,</v>

3919
02:44:00.900 --> 02:44:03.510
<v Speaker 2>if you would have ever thought when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>started standup that you'd be sort of</v>

3920
02:44:03.511 --> 02:44:05.190
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you're kind of like a lifestyle</v>

3921
02:44:05.191 --> 02:44:06.660
<v Speaker 2>guru in a in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3922
02:44:06.661 --> 02:44:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Like every time I've done the sensory</v>
<v Speaker 2>deprivation stuff,</v>

3923
02:44:08.791 --> 02:44:11.700
<v Speaker 2>ride the float stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I've gone into the place when</v>

3924
02:44:11.701 --> 02:44:13.680
<v Speaker 2>I just talked to the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she's like setting it up or</v>

3925
02:44:13.681 --> 02:44:14.401
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like,</v>

3926
02:44:14.401 --> 02:44:16.740
<v Speaker 2>oh Joe Rogan got me into this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're always like,</v>

3927
02:44:16.741 --> 02:44:18.570
<v Speaker 2>oh Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got everybody into this.</v>

3928
02:44:18.571 --> 02:44:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Like you literally like created float</v>
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>

3929
02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:23.100
<v Speaker 2>All,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to one in Nashville,</v>

3930
02:44:23.101 --> 02:44:24.450
<v Speaker 2>like the woman was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Joe Rogan.</v>

3931
02:44:24.451 --> 02:44:27.420
<v Speaker 2>I love Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like that and the mma stuff and all</v>

3932
02:44:27.421 --> 02:44:29.640
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what a bizarre adventure.</v>

3933
02:44:29.641 --> 02:44:31.560
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you probably would have never</v>

3934
02:44:31.561 --> 02:44:32.320
<v Speaker 2>thought</v>

3935
02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:36.820
<v Speaker 5>now that the only reason why it happened</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I had no intention of doing it.</v>

3936
02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:39.310
<v Speaker 5>It's like I didn't have to pull them</v>
<v Speaker 5>zero and time,</v>

3937
02:44:39.311 --> 02:44:42.490
<v Speaker 5>never written a book on lifestyle or</v>
<v Speaker 5>just fucking what to do.</v>

3938
02:44:42.610 --> 02:44:45.790
<v Speaker 5>I just say what I do and I do it by</v>
<v Speaker 5>example.</v>

3939
02:44:45.791 --> 02:44:48.910
<v Speaker 5>Like obviously I do all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that Jim's not there for looks.</v>

3940
02:44:48.930 --> 02:44:50.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucking do all these things.</v>

3941
02:44:50.531 --> 02:44:51.820
<v Speaker 5>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this is,</v>

3942
02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:54.910
<v Speaker 5>this is just a natural thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>happened,</v>

3943
02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:59.030
<v Speaker 5>but the float things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the most bizarre one because I can't</v>

3944
02:44:59.031 --> 02:45:03.050
<v Speaker 5>believe I'm the one to tell everybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this doesn't he man.</v>

3945
02:45:03.170 --> 02:45:05.960
<v Speaker 5>But how the fuck doesn't everybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>already know they do now.</v>

3946
02:45:05.961 --> 02:45:08.630
<v Speaker 5>More people know now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how the fuck didn't they know when I</v>

3947
02:45:08.631 --> 02:45:13.510
<v Speaker 5>first got my tank in 2002 and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had been talking about it for a couple</v>

3948
02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:15.220
<v Speaker 5>of years before because I had done one</v>
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>

3949
02:45:15.221 --> 02:45:17.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go to a place and you rent it for an</v>

3950
02:45:17.410 --> 02:45:18.243
<v Speaker 5>hour.</v>

3951
02:45:18.430 --> 02:45:20.300
<v Speaker 5>That's how we regular people do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

3952
02:45:20.310 --> 02:45:23.650
<v Speaker 5>You've got to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need one man fucking need.</v>

3953
02:45:23.651 --> 02:45:25.240
<v Speaker 5>When I tell you how often do you turn</v>
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>

3954
02:45:25.300 --> 02:45:26.710
<v Speaker 5>As much as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's right there.</v>

3955
02:45:26.740 --> 02:45:30.290
<v Speaker 5>It's nice you're doing this more like</v>
<v Speaker 5>once a week or oh,</v>

3956
02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:33.160
<v Speaker 5>more than that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I like to come in here,</v>

3957
02:45:33.161 --> 02:45:33.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>different,</v>

3958
02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:36.370
<v Speaker 5>I'll come in here sometimes even after</v>
<v Speaker 5>the comedy store,</v>

3959
02:45:36.730 --> 02:45:38.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>coming near Weird Times.</v>

3960
02:45:38.261 --> 02:45:42.740
<v Speaker 5>I'll come in here during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the whole idea is that this is</v>

3961
02:45:42.741 --> 02:45:47.741
<v Speaker 5>something that somehow or another was</v>
<v Speaker 5>created in the 60s by John Lilly and</v>

3962
02:45:48.500 --> 02:45:52.030
<v Speaker 5>nobody talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like kind of a suit,</v>

3963
02:45:52.031 --> 02:45:54.730
<v Speaker 5>Weirdo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>popular thing with hippies for awhile</v>

3964
02:45:55.180 --> 02:45:58.300
<v Speaker 5>and then it fucking went away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they were barely around.</v>

3965
02:45:58.690 --> 02:46:01.180
<v Speaker 5>And then I started talking about it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>now they're everywhere all over the</v>

3966
02:46:01.181 --> 02:46:03.280
<v Speaker 5>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that is the strangest thing to me.</v>

3967
02:46:03.430 --> 02:46:07.000
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the strangest things about</v>
<v Speaker 5>my entire career is that the float tank</v>

3968
02:46:07.001 --> 02:46:08.890
<v Speaker 5>business has sort of started up because</v>
<v Speaker 5>of me.</v>

3969
02:46:08.980 --> 02:46:10.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that they're everywhere in the world</v>

3970
02:46:10.971 --> 02:46:13.190
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's hundreds of them everywhere in</v>

3971
02:46:13.191 --> 02:46:15.770
<v Speaker 5>every country and they didn't exist</v>
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>

3972
02:46:16.610 --> 02:46:17.990
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that somehow or another,</v>

3973
02:46:17.991 --> 02:46:20.450
<v Speaker 5>you could directly connect them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of them.</v>

3974
02:46:20.451 --> 02:46:22.010
<v Speaker 5>To me that's very strange.</v>

3975
02:46:22.170 --> 02:46:23.970
<v Speaker 2>What does that say about ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3976
02:46:23.971 --> 02:46:27.660
<v Speaker 2>what does that say about saying what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think and explaining what your life is</v>

3977
02:46:27.661 --> 02:46:29.130
<v Speaker 2>to people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they want.</v>

3978
02:46:29.131 --> 02:46:29.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when I,</v>

3979
02:46:29.910 --> 02:46:31.950
<v Speaker 2>when I'm with Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing I realized more than anything</v>

3980
02:46:31.951 --> 02:46:36.180
<v Speaker 2>else is he's giving them a little room</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be who they are.</v>

3981
02:46:36.181 --> 02:46:38.280
<v Speaker 2>He's taken some of the bullets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3982
02:46:38.281 --> 02:46:40.200
<v Speaker 2>the hit pieces and all that stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about.</v>

3983
02:46:40.410 --> 02:46:44.100
<v Speaker 2>He takes a little bit of that to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>these positions that are not wrong,</v>

3984
02:46:44.130 --> 02:46:48.150
<v Speaker 2>but her just politically incorrect or</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat intraocular are controversial.</v>

3985
02:46:48.570 --> 02:46:52.260
<v Speaker 2>And by taking those positions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gives other people just a little bit</v>

3986
02:46:52.261 --> 02:46:54.900
<v Speaker 2>of a force field to think a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3987
02:46:54.940 --> 02:46:57.000
<v Speaker 2>so for you in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you started doing something</v>

3988
02:46:57.001 --> 02:47:00.330
<v Speaker 2>that gave you a little peace of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little something that made you feel</v>

3989
02:47:00.331 --> 02:47:03.510
<v Speaker 2>good and feel healthy and clean and</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally sound and all that.</v>

3990
02:47:03.690 --> 02:47:06.330
<v Speaker 2>And then you started talking about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then holy shit,</v>

3991
02:47:06.331 --> 02:47:10.200
<v Speaker 2>somebody in Nebraska was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try that.</v>

3992
02:47:10.530 --> 02:47:13.410
<v Speaker 2>And the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she opened a clinic for it and is doing</v>

3993
02:47:13.411 --> 02:47:14.041
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3994
02:47:14.041 --> 02:47:18.420
<v Speaker 2>And then that that spurs and so if</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the beauty of saying what you</v>

3995
02:47:18.421 --> 02:47:18.980
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

3996
02:47:18.980 --> 02:47:22.690
<v Speaker 5>well it also works the same reason why</v>
<v Speaker 5>this podcast works like this pot.</v>

3997
02:47:22.700 --> 02:47:25.640
<v Speaker 5>I've never promoted this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just did it.</v>

3998
02:47:25.641 --> 02:47:27.650
<v Speaker 5>And through word of mouth it got bigger</v>
<v Speaker 5>and bigger.</v>

3999
02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:30.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing about float tanks is I'm</v>

4000
02:47:30.511 --> 02:47:33.330
<v Speaker 5>telling you how amazing it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You try it and it doesn't suck.</v>

4001
02:47:34.110 --> 02:47:36.420
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like if you don't enjoy that,</v>

4002
02:47:36.421 --> 02:47:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4003
02:47:37.740 --> 02:47:39.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not like all these people went and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried it out.</v>

4004
02:47:39.451 --> 02:47:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Like he fucking lied to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

4005
02:47:41.730 --> 02:47:42.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went to,</v>

4006
02:47:42.420 --> 02:47:43.950
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so relaxing.</v>

4007
02:47:43.951 --> 02:47:45.510
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

4008
02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:48.310
<v Speaker 5>Fresh perspective and my body feels</v>
<v Speaker 5>loose and relaxed.</v>

4009
02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:51.010
<v Speaker 5>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's a real positive</v>

4010
02:47:51.011 --> 02:47:52.210
<v Speaker 5>benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling the truth.</v>

4011
02:47:52.330 --> 02:47:55.540
<v Speaker 2>How quick can you snap into the zone</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you want to get into and you're in</v>

4012
02:47:55.541 --> 02:47:58.060
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's when I was just did it a</v>

4013
02:47:58.060 --> 02:47:59.800
<v Speaker 2>couple of days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done it a couple times now and I've</v>

4014
02:47:59.801 --> 02:48:02.980
<v Speaker 2>usually been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes me about 20 minutes to kind of</v>

4015
02:48:02.981 --> 02:48:04.090
<v Speaker 2>clear the clutter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

4016
02:48:04.091 --> 02:48:05.590
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's less.</v>

4017
02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:08.230
<v Speaker 2>This last time just cause I think we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been traveling so much.</v>

4018
02:48:08.231 --> 02:48:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I've been planes every day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

4019
02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:12.070
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't till the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it happens.</v>

4020
02:48:12.071 --> 02:48:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Like the last five minutes I finally got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that place where I was kind of</v>

4021
02:48:17.071 --> 02:48:19.110
<v Speaker 2>disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you have a trick for that when</v>

4022
02:48:19.111 --> 02:48:19.944
<v Speaker 2>you get in there?</v>

4023
02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:23.800
<v Speaker 5>I've done it so many times that my body</v>
<v Speaker 5>knows what it's doing.</v>

4024
02:48:23.830 --> 02:48:25.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lay in a tank and my body is like,</v>

4025
02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:27.300
<v Speaker 5>oh here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

4026
02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:28.840
<v Speaker 5>just sink in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I've done it.</v>

4027
02:48:29.020 --> 02:48:33.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many times I've had a</v>
<v Speaker 5>tank since 2002 so you're more tank</v>

4028
02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:36.100
<v Speaker 5>tank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tank time,</v>

4029
02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:38.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then I've been in there on mushrooms</v>

4030
02:48:38.501 --> 02:48:42.790
<v Speaker 5>and weed and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'd edibles especially that's the weird</v>

4031
02:48:42.791 --> 02:48:45.500
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This marijuana edibles or the one on</v>

4032
02:48:45.510 --> 02:48:49.900
<v Speaker 5>some of the most underrated psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 5>in terms of like introspective thinking,</v>

4033
02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:51.730
<v Speaker 5>self examination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

4034
02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:56.020
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those things that just</v>
<v Speaker 5>forces you to really go over every</v>

4035
02:48:56.021 --> 02:48:59.230
<v Speaker 5>single aspect of your subconscious</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to hide from.</v>

4036
02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:02.460
<v Speaker 2>You got gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a good strain of Endeca that's</v>

4037
02:49:02.461 --> 02:49:06.690
<v Speaker 2>not going to completely destroy me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my weed situation at this point and</v>

4038
02:49:06.691 --> 02:49:08.190
<v Speaker 2>I used be a big pothead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My weed</v>

4039
02:49:08.190 --> 02:49:11.970
<v Speaker 4>thing is like end of the night puff for</v>
<v Speaker 4>my vape pen,</v>

4040
02:49:11.971 --> 02:49:16.290
<v Speaker 4>like watch the same simpsons episode</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I loved in 1989 like that's good</v>

4041
02:49:16.291 --> 02:49:17.940
<v Speaker 4>enough for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't need,</v>

4042
02:49:18.060 --> 02:49:20.850
<v Speaker 4>like I know a lot of my comic friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they want to smoke a sativa and</v>

4043
02:49:20.910 --> 02:49:21.321
<v Speaker 4>write,</v>
<v Speaker 4>write,</v>

4044
02:49:21.321 --> 02:49:22.110
<v Speaker 4>write,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>

4045
02:49:22.110 --> 02:49:24.510
<v Speaker 4>I've opened up enough doors in my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If anything,</v>

4046
02:49:24.511 --> 02:49:26.150
<v Speaker 4>I'd tightened a couple of hinges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

4047
02:49:26.210 --> 02:49:29.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to go the other way again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like for me it's much more about</v>

4048
02:49:29.131 --> 02:49:32.760
<v Speaker 4>relaxation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there's a lot of great sativas or</v>

4049
02:49:32.761 --> 02:49:34.740
<v Speaker 4>indicas rather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All you have to do is just go to any</v>

4050
02:49:34.741 --> 02:49:37.620
<v Speaker 4>store and then just take a little hit</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then we'll try it out.</v>

4051
02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:40.140
<v Speaker 4>Just the whole thing is just don't go</v>
<v Speaker 4>too deep.</v>

4052
02:49:40.410 --> 02:49:43.080
<v Speaker 4>Like people try three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four or five hits and then never smoked</v>

4053
02:49:43.081 --> 02:49:47.160
<v Speaker 4>pot before and then they were in a k</v>
<v Speaker 4>hole in the corner crying and screaming.</v>

4054
02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:48.850
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like Jesus,</v>

4055
02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:49.770
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your body doesn't know.</v>

4056
02:49:49.771 --> 02:49:52.920
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck to do with all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thc like this,</v>

4057
02:49:52.950 --> 02:49:53.810
<v Speaker 4>watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch this.</v>

4058
02:49:53.820 --> 02:49:55.740
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

4059
02:49:55.770 --> 02:49:57.060
<v Speaker 4>You're good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Blow it out.</v>

4060
02:49:57.240 --> 02:49:59.220
<v Speaker 4>Relax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give it an hour.</v>

4061
02:49:59.430 --> 02:50:02.730
<v Speaker 4>Find out what the fuck the effect is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't just keep hitting it.</v>

4062
02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:04.470
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen people that don't smoke.</v>

4063
02:50:04.471 --> 02:50:09.471
<v Speaker 4>Poggle I'll try</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then an hour later I'm like,</v>

4064
02:50:10.381 --> 02:50:13.350
<v Speaker 4>are you going to die?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think you're going to die?</v>

4065
02:50:13.380 --> 02:50:14.130
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look,</v>

4066
02:50:14.130 --> 02:50:15.630
<v Speaker 4>you're freaked out man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4067
02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.570
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I back in the day,</v>

4068
02:50:18.571 --> 02:50:20.070
<v Speaker 4>like college and a little bit after</v>
<v Speaker 4>college,</v>

4069
02:50:20.100 --> 02:50:21.660
<v Speaker 4>I did mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

4070
02:50:21.661 --> 02:50:23.100
<v Speaker 4>maybe 20 times in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

4071
02:50:23.190 --> 02:50:25.410
<v Speaker 4>something around there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I haven't done it in about 15</v>

4072
02:50:25.411 --> 02:50:27.030
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then about six months ago,</v>

4147
02:53:08.020 --> 02:53:10.840
<v Speaker 5>my drive is because I know there's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of people that are getting</v>

4148
02:53:10.841 --> 02:53:13.180

4152
02:53:22.641 --> 02:53:25.160
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to do the best fucking show I can</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm dead serious about that.</v>

4154
02:53:27.411 --> 02:53:30.200
<v Speaker 5>That's very important to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand it's a massive</v>

4155
02:53:30.201 --> 02:53:33.830
<v Speaker 5>responsibility and I'm doing the Chicago</v>
<v Speaker 5>theater like I did last weekend.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Two shows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>3,700 people show.</v>

4157

<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want anybody to be disappointed.</v>

4158
02:53:39.891 --> 02:53:44.060
<v Speaker 5>I want to do my best job the best I can</v>
<v Speaker 5>do and that's where my drive is.</v>

4159
02:53:44.061 --> 02:53:46.940
<v Speaker 5>My drive is to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm dissecting material,</v>

4160
02:53:46.941 --> 02:53:48.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm rewriting it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm practicing.</v>

4161
02:53:48.591 --> 02:53:50.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went up three times last night.</v>

4162
02:53:50.480 --> 02:53:52.720
<v Speaker 5>I'll probably go up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going up at least two times tonight.</v>

4163
02:53:52.730 --> 02:53:54.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing the Improv and I'm doing the</v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy store.</v>

4164
02:53:55.130 --> 02:53:56.510
<v Speaker 5>I do that all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4165
02:53:56.570 --> 02:53:58.850
<v Speaker 5>I do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And my drive is to,</v>

4166
02:53:59.180 --> 02:54:03.750
<v Speaker 5>there's a great reward in making people</v>
<v Speaker 5>laugh and there's a great reward in,</v>

4167
02:54:03.751 --> 02:54:06.650
<v Speaker 5>in d we made an exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4168
02:54:06.780 --> 02:54:08.000
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they came to see me,</v>

4169
02:54:08.001 --> 02:54:08.960
<v Speaker 5>I made them laugh.</v>

4170
02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:10.470
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

4171
02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:12.560
<v Speaker 5>we had a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the deal.</v>

4172
02:54:12.590 --> 02:54:14.660
<v Speaker 5>And I've worked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not an easy deal.</v>

4173
02:54:14.661 --> 02:54:17.570
<v Speaker 5>It's like you got to work hard to fill</v>
<v Speaker 5>your end of the bargain.</v>

4174
02:54:18.020 --> 02:54:22.630
<v Speaker 5>But if you do work hard and you do work</v>
<v Speaker 5>at it and you do examine it,</v>

4175
02:54:22.650 --> 02:54:26.480
<v Speaker 5>you do put in the hours on stage and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>do go over the rewrites and listen to</v>

4176
02:54:26.481 --> 02:54:29.470
<v Speaker 5>the recordings and do your best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's rewarding.</v>

4177
02:54:29.490 --> 02:54:30.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reward is that I,</v>

4178
02:54:30.800 --> 02:54:31.633
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4179
02:54:31.900 --> 02:54:34.360
<v Speaker 5>I can say that those people have a good</v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

4180
02:54:34.361 --> 02:54:37.420
<v Speaker 5>Like when I put a video up on Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of people cheering after the</v>

4181
02:54:37.421 --> 02:54:39.040
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm super happy.</v>

4185
02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:46.870
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing like thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4186
02:54:46.900 --> 02:54:48.610
<v Speaker 4>Cause I told you I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just getting back in.</v>

4187
02:54:48.611 --> 02:54:50.800
<v Speaker 4>So I just booked my last couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

4188
02:54:50.801 --> 02:54:52.540
<v Speaker 4>So on the nights off that I'm with</v>
<v Speaker 4>Peterson.</v>

4189
02:54:52.541 --> 02:54:56.350
<v Speaker 4>So we sold out the DCM prep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that champion perhaps holdout Irvine</v>

4190
02:54:56.350 --> 02:54:57.670
<v Speaker 4>Improv here or by an Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4191
02:54:57.840 --> 02:55:01.960
<v Speaker 4>Urban apro and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel that now cause it's weird because</v>

4192
02:55:01.961 --> 02:55:04.130
<v Speaker 4>you don't know me from comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like</v>

4193
02:55:04.130 --> 02:55:06.830
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived all those New York City years as</v>

4194
02:55:06.831 --> 02:55:08.840
<v Speaker 2>a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never hit into,</v>

4195
02:55:08.870 --> 02:55:12.050
<v Speaker 2>I was a good comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never hit into to TV in that way.</v>

4196
02:55:12.051 --> 02:55:14.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I started doing all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>other things that led me to this.</v>

4197
02:55:14.960 --> 02:55:17.630
<v Speaker 2>But it's like they can put my name up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now it sells out.</v>

4198
02:55:17.690 --> 02:55:19.550
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't before.</v>

4199
02:55:19.700 --> 02:55:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now it's like,</v>

4200
02:55:20.781 --> 02:55:22.670
<v Speaker 2>I feel this extra pressure of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

4201
02:55:22.671 --> 02:55:24.890
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're really coming from me.</v>

4202
02:55:24.970 --> 02:55:28.390
<v Speaker 2>It is extra pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's reward to it too.</v>

4203
02:55:28.430 --> 02:55:31.040
<v Speaker 2>It's been awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like I'm getting back to</v>

4204
02:55:31.041 --> 02:55:34.550
<v Speaker 2>this thing that people don't know me</v>
<v Speaker 2>from and it's like I'm good.</v>

4205
02:55:34.551 --> 02:55:35.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent you,</v>

4206
02:55:35.421 --> 02:55:36.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hour.</v>

4207
02:55:36.921 --> 02:55:38.810
<v Speaker 2>I haven't sent it to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not putting up publicly,</v>

4208
02:55:38.811 --> 02:55:41.300
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted you to see it because even</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could only watch a minute,</v>

4209
02:55:41.690 --> 02:55:44.030
<v Speaker 2>because I wanted you to know that I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 2>real comic,</v>

4210
02:55:44.060 --> 02:55:44.690
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

4211
02:55:44.690 --> 02:55:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise it's like we can all</v>

4212
02:55:46.431 --> 02:55:47.061
<v Speaker 2>sit here and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4213
02:55:47.061 --> 02:55:48.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

4214
02:55:48.231 --> 02:55:49.550
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4215
02:55:50.330 --> 02:55:52.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly powerful.</v>

4216
02:55:52.611 --> 02:55:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're in that room with those</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and you make it real for that.</v>

4217
02:55:55.491 --> 02:55:58.370
<v Speaker 2>And I know my style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm never going to be the best joke</v>

4218
02:55:58.371 --> 02:56:00.920
<v Speaker 2>writer on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not where my passions lie,</v>

4219
02:56:00.921 --> 02:56:05.490
<v Speaker 2>but I like being in that room with these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people doing what we did here and,</v>

4220
02:56:05.810 --> 02:56:08.750
<v Speaker 2>and getting everybody playing and being</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the moment.</v>

4221
02:56:08.751 --> 02:56:12.020
<v Speaker 2>And I get people kind of yelling at each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other and screaming and announcing their</v>

4222
02:56:12.021 --> 02:56:14.600
<v Speaker 2>political differences and like all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy shit.</v>

4223
02:56:14.900 --> 02:56:17.690
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know anyone that's doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that I'm doing it.</v>

4224
02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:21.140
<v Speaker 2>And it's not like I'm doing a set the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way Seinfeld with layout,</v>

4225
02:56:21.170 --> 02:56:22.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every word,</v>

4226
02:56:22.610 --> 02:56:23.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the hour.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but I love it.</v>

4229
02:56:25.610 --> 02:56:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

4230
02:56:27.201 --> 02:56:29.170
<v Speaker 2>The beautiful thing about comedy is any</v>
<v Speaker 2>way you want it.</v>

4231
02:56:29.380 --> 02:56:31.160
<v Speaker 2>You do it your way,</v>
