<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

33
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Country Music is supposed to be Merle haggard,</v>

34
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Cash.</v>

35
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:02.860
<v Speaker 1>And you know that that's like real country music.</v>

36
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.731
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

37
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:04.211
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>

38
00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:05.200

39
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.580
<v Speaker 1>You're standing in front of a jet.</v>

40
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>The fuck are you doing in front of a jet?</v>

41
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.360
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing like in a hanger?</v>

42
00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Like he's playing overseas,</v>

43
00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:16.060
<v Speaker 1>like mere for overseas with the boys I'm getting from the Jetta supports troops.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What are you doing there?</v>

49
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the whole show was in front of a jet.</v>

50
00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:26.800
<v Speaker 1>They might've done the whole country music awards in front of a jet,</v>

51
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.060
<v Speaker 1>which would have been awesome.</v>

52
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the sets changed,</v>

53
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.461
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

54
00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I really have no idea.</v>

55
00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I only watched it for a little bit,</v>

56
00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:33.400
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

57
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.690
<v Speaker 1>I made a joke that country music awards hates black people so much.</v>

58
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>They won't even use black microphones cause it was a red microphone,</v>

59
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>a lawyer.</v>

60
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

61
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.840
<v Speaker 1>it was last time you saw a red microphone.</v>

62
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Funny Cause I will shit on stuff online and I'm like,</v>

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make fun of that or I don't know.</v>

67
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.891
<v Speaker 1>It's hard man.</v>

68
00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Because I always want to say what's funny and what I would say amongst my</v>

69
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:02.590
<v Speaker 1>friends who wouldn't judge me like that,</v>

70
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>that we could all be talking like,</v>

71
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:06.830
<v Speaker 1>like per perfect example,</v>

72
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:07.461
<v Speaker 1>Amy Schumer,</v>

73
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:10.130
<v Speaker 1>when Amy Schumer's on yesterday and we were talking to her,</v>

74
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.300
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

75
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Speaker 1>we were joking around about her mother possibly being a cunt.</v>

76
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.930
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

77
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.880

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:19.700
<v Speaker 1>you could just always go there when you're with a bunch of comics,</v>

81
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.830
<v Speaker 1>you're all just sitting around shit on each other.</v>

82
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>You could always go to some terrible place and we don't really think you mean</v>

83
00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

84
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to call you on it.</v>

85
00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>I know you're just trying to be funny,</v>

86
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.480
<v Speaker 1>but saying something fucked up.</v>

87
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.250
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

88
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.431
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

89
00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:32.260
<v Speaker 1>that's like with the,</v>

90
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.570
<v Speaker 1>we talked about the n word last time,</v>

91
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:35.404
<v Speaker 1>but I was,</v>

92
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.570
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about how comics,</v>

93
00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:40.420
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking today how my brother Kevin Comedian,</v>

94
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Brennan and a tell when I was like in high school had a joke where if they</v>

95
00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:47.590
<v Speaker 1>would like be on the phone and they go like,</v>

96
00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:47.711
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

97
00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:48.640
<v Speaker 1>what's the weather like?</v>

98
00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:49.600
<v Speaker 1>And he'd be like,</v>

99
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>terrain and that'd be like fucking daggers.</v>

100
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.150
<v Speaker 1>But somehow the blast,</v>

101
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.640
<v Speaker 1>I remote control the weather.</v>

102
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh and Hilarious,</v>

103
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.413
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

104
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.101
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

105
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>of course you don't mean it.</v>

106
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>And also the ID,</v>

107
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>you're making fun of the idea that most people just don't,</v>

108
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.213
<v Speaker 1>and that's how I got hired.</v>

109
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>They just don't get hired and they won't,</v>

110
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>they're not able to look at life with layers.</v>

111
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

112
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>And they can't see that at the bottom of it.</v>

113
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be about intent,</v>

114
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

116
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.710
<v Speaker 1>this is not just about white guys that are throwing nay.</v>

117
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

118
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:25.301
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

119
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:26.021
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

120
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:27.630
<v Speaker 1>or like you'll just go like water.</v>

121
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Cont yeah,</v>

122
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>you got to know when someone is joking,</v>

123
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.580
<v Speaker 1>when it's obvious there's,</v>

124
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's certain people,</v>

125
00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:36.960
<v Speaker 1>but some people will say things in a crowd and like,</v>

126
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 1>you'll be the only one that laughs and there'll be like eight or nine people</v>

127
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>that are really pissed off.</v>

128
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.633
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

129
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.430

130
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

131
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>with the Geico ads and all the Gilbert's jokes about the tsunami.</v>

132
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 1>We're fucking hilarious.</v>

133
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.340
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

134
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

135
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.890
<v Speaker 1>that was as he was fought by,</v>

136
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 1>I was watching them in real time going like,</v>

137
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:55.991
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>these are fucking funny.</v>

139
00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.880
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd gotten in trouble.</v>

140
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.371
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

141
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>well he went too quick,</v>

142
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.390
<v Speaker 1>too quick.</v>

143
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't even do that now.</v>

144
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't do tsunami too soon.</v>

145
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

146
