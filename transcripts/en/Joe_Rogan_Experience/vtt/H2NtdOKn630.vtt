<v Speaker 2>Welcome back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brought notes.</v>

5
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a couple of notes.</v>

6
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to repeat myself since the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last time because you're the only guest</v>

7
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 2>ever in the history of this podcast that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is brought notes to make sure they don't</v>

8
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:41.690
<v Speaker 2>repeat themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

9
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 2>They say it's the first time I do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

10
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.550
<v Speaker 2>This like or any other interview I never</v>
<v Speaker 2>go programmed or premeditated or</v>

11
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 2>prepared whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just jump in,</v>

12
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:57.831
<v Speaker 2>but I think this is much more important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Joe Rogan man and the ice man man.</v>

13
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.320
<v Speaker 2>And you are a big window and I'm still</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the mission trying to get it out to</v>

14
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:10.190
<v Speaker 2>everybody that we are able to do so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and uh,</v>

15
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all natural what we do.</v>

16
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.640
<v Speaker 2>So there is no money attached to it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

17
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a struggle to get it out there,</v>

18
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.130
<v Speaker 2>but we get more and more scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence a piling up.</v>

19
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 2>And I'm here to present new insight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

20

<v Speaker 2>I think you're winning a struggle for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure because I hear about you all the</v>

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 2>give a billionaire some very powerful</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are very good insights in</v>

48
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:50.410
<v Speaker 2>their own stressful lives.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm in there to teach them how to handle</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress hormone at the deepest in the</v>

50
00:02:57.721 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 2>brain as in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the body.</v>

51
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.693
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

52
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend of mine who was trying to</v>

53
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 3>do a parody on Tony Robbins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he went and researched him and he was</v>

54
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 3>going to listen to some of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>recordings and listen to some of his</v>

55
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 3>speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his goal was to find what's stupid</v>

56
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:14.880
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he started going like,</v>

57
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:16.140
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is honest.</v>

58
00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:17.030
<v Speaker 3>And that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Calvin,</v>

59
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 3>do you remember who it was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were talking about it in here.</v>

60
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was calvin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was researching him for</v>

61
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 3>something that he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then along the way started realizing</v>

62
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's fucking legit,</v>

63
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.500
<v Speaker 3>but he's one of the rare ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like almost everyone.</v>

64
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.180
<v Speaker 3>That's like a professional motivator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you go behind and go,</v>

65
00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what do you do?</v>

66
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what do you do?</v>

67
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 3>You just motivate people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you had done anything?</v>

68
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Like you're telling people they can go</v>
<v Speaker 3>do things,</v>

69
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:46.470
<v Speaker 3>but what the fuck have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What have you done sir?</v>

70
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 3>And most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't do shit.</v>

71
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.380
<v Speaker 3>They just get together with big</v>
<v Speaker 3>seminars.</v>

72
00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 3>They tell people they can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do it.</v>

73
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do it now.</v>

74
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 3>But you never go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

75
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 3>what have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You on the other hand,</v>

76
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've done a lot of shit.</v>

77
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.240
<v Speaker 3>So it's one thing when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that,</v>

78
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 3>that ice man Hoff Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he legit?</v>

79
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:05.914
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

80
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 3>do you have wikipedia?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you google?</v>

81
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.840
<v Speaker 4>Well we have the live and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming,</v>

82
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>January,</v>

83
00:04:16.431 --> 00:04:18.120
<v Speaker 4>we're going to do Kilimanjaro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

84
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you already offered that optimum shoot.</v>

85
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.590
<v Speaker 4>You shoot going to Kilimanjaro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey man,</v>

86
00:04:24.591 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 4>kill a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know</v>

87
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 3>anyone from afar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Los Angeles while watching</v>

88
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 3>television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be live tweeting it</v>

89
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.640
<v Speaker 4>right on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now we're doing a scientific</v>

90
00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:43.641
<v Speaker 4>research and show that the rat cell</v>
<v Speaker 4>generation can be accelerated if it is</v>

91
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:49.791
<v Speaker 4>so in those circumstances than signs has</v>
<v Speaker 4>to update the circumstances where their</v>

92
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:55.650
<v Speaker 4>cells can be regenerated is like in 24</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours,</v>

93
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:59.730
<v Speaker 4>the body is not able to adapt to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>circumstances where there is a lack of</v>

94
00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:04.110
<v Speaker 4>oxygen is half the oxygen nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we go into the altitude on</v>

95
00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:08.670
<v Speaker 4>Kilimanjaro is a six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 20,000 feet at the top,</v>

96
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 4>so to say 15,000 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The acclimatization,</v>

97
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.880
<v Speaker 4>the adaptation is not as fast in human</v>
<v Speaker 4>bodies.</v>

98
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.120
<v Speaker 4>Now we found his breathing techniques</v>
<v Speaker 4>and using the mind and that enabled us</v>

99
00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:26.940
<v Speaker 4>to accelerate that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they thought,</v>

100
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:28.980
<v Speaker 4>what signs is thinking that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

101
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.990
<v Speaker 4>that it is arranged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll autonomously so outside of our will</v>

102
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.220
<v Speaker 4>and we cannot interfere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We cannot intervene now.</v>

103
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.700
<v Speaker 4>So we will show that with like 30 people</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

104
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 4>past January I did it with a person 76</v>
<v Speaker 4>years old without a prior mountaineering</v>

105
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:54.570
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he did it in 44 hours.</v>

106
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.240
<v Speaker 4>Don't 76,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

107
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a robust 76</v>

108
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 2>year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was a good guy that will burn</v>

109
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 2>brightly for the last couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His old life is dead,</v>

110
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 2>really transferred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

111
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you this.</v>

112
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.520
<v Speaker 2>So the standard model of what someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do as far as how much red so red</v>

113
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 2>blood cells they can generate is</v>
<v Speaker 2>observed and they thought that it was at</v>

114
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 2>15,000 feet it became too difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you've shown that with your</v>

115
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 2>exercises and when your deep breathing</v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques that you can actually</v>

116
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:34.271
<v Speaker 2>accelerate red blood cell count on</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciously or at least not consciously</v>

117
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 2>with your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your through conscious action,</v>

118
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 2>conscious action using the breath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what techniques are you using the</v>

119
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 2>same what we did last time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then adapt it to while you are</v>

120
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:50.891
<v Speaker 2>walking and when a first sign of ams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of oxygen into hat means headache,</v>

121
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.700
<v Speaker 2>a Mss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acute mountain sickness and the first</v>

122
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 2>sinus headache and that means a lack of</v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen inside the brain.</v>

123
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Normally we are not able to get oxygen</v>
<v Speaker 2>then at that moment,</v>

124
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.510
<v Speaker 2>inside the brain to equal the violence</v>
<v Speaker 2>that violence,</v>

125
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.590
<v Speaker 2>the lack of oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

126
00:07:10.591 --> 00:07:15.320
<v Speaker 2>I've learned to just to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we tackled the problem and keep on</v>

127
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.210
<v Speaker 2>able to perform in the extreme</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions even so through this</v>

128
00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 2>technique of taking these enormous deep</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaths,</v>

129
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.110
<v Speaker 2>letting some of it out and then trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to refill and then letting some of it</v>

130
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:28.430
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to refill,</v>

131
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:33.431
<v Speaker 2>letting some of it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're forcing your body to</v>

132
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.790
<v Speaker 2>your forcing your lungs to constantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>carry air.</v>

133
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

134
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it is,</v>

135
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.740
<v Speaker 2>we use the youngsters to passage way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it gets into the lymphatic system.</v>

136
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 2>It gets into the tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

137
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:53.021
<v Speaker 2>what we just found with the university</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in Germany they found out that the</v>

138
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:58.270
<v Speaker 2>devices that showed that we have 100</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent blood saturation,</v>

139
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.290
<v Speaker 2>oxygen in the blood is not 100 percent.</v>

140
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.670
<v Speaker 2>We go more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found it out for the thought was</v>

141
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:10.730
<v Speaker 2>100 percent blood saturation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's actually a higher level above</v>

142
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

143
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.400
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I always sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now it says it's like proven.</v>

144
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.810
<v Speaker 2>So what they thought was 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood saturation was just based on what</v>

145
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:24.520
<v Speaker 2>people normally do with no extra</v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques involved.</v>

146
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

147
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Based on that they made devices and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 100 percent saturation in the blood is</v>

148
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:37.301
<v Speaker 2>100 percent and then you should be like</v>
<v Speaker 2>sane.</v>

149
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.590
<v Speaker 2>But now we've got this professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a biochemical professor.</v>

150
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

151
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.180
<v Speaker 2>whatever his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr. Ms Dot Keith.</v>

152
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Professor miscut at East.</v>

153
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Given the name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

154
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like mosquito.</v>

155
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.570
<v Speaker 2>What a name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A professor.</v>

156
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A professor,</v>

157
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:02.210
<v Speaker 2>fly professor mosquito,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this biochemical professor and he</v>

158
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.300
<v Speaker 2>telled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

159
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.700
<v Speaker 2>looking at the results,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you have produced with the</v>

160
00:09:07.701 --> 00:09:12.701
<v Speaker 2>university regarding to the immune</v>
<v Speaker 2>system and influencing intuity</v>

161
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:15.690
<v Speaker 2>autonomous nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can say,</v>

162
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys have found a way to tap into</v>

163
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 2>the tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the lymphatic system and take away</v>

164
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 2>the acidity over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

165
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.780
<v Speaker 2>and the storage capacity of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lymphatic system at that deeper level</v>

166
00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:35.781
<v Speaker 2>than the blood is actually a storage</v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to have chemistry.</v>

167
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.513
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

168
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:43.610
<v Speaker 2>which is wrong as taught up over there</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't mess with a rest of the</v>

169
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 2>physiology to maintain functionality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

170
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:52.281
<v Speaker 2>but in time you got to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like garbage and at garbage we</v>

171
00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:55.530
<v Speaker 2>could not tap into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm so confused.</v>

172
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.430
<v Speaker 2>So what is that garbage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The garbage is a wrong chemistry.</v>

173
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:00.800
<v Speaker 2>You like be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

174
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.900
<v Speaker 2>an acidic state of chemistry in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lymphatic system as well.</v>

175
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Do they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they know what that.</v>

176
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have they isolated that as is on an</v>

177
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:12.330
<v Speaker 2>actual compound?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I tell you what it is that they are</v>

178
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:13.740
<v Speaker 2>monitoring?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

179
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.990
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that acidity chronically,</v>

180
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 2>they're not being dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This professor,</v>

181
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.840
<v Speaker 2>my biomedical professor tells us that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>95 percent of the auto immune diseases,</v>

182
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of it,</v>

183
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:37.370
<v Speaker 2>so 95 percent of autoimmune diseases are</v>
<v Speaker 2>caused by some sort of acidity,</v>

184
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 2>long term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long time presence of acidity not</v>

185
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Speaker 2>being dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll deal with you in the end and</v>

186
00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:48.960
<v Speaker 2>deregulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say the chemistry in the rest of the</v>

187
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The biochemical processes actually does</v>

188
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.180
<v Speaker 2>quite logic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>logical,</v>

189
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.540
<v Speaker 2>but we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he knew he knew that,</v>

190
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:02.160
<v Speaker 2>but then we came up with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the cause of this acidity?</v>

191
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Is it diabetes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is a stress based?</v>

192
00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:05.720
<v Speaker 2>Is it all the above?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

193
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Anything that is stress too much we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>handle.</v>

194
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.270
<v Speaker 2>So Diet like inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress as far as pressure,</v>

195
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:18.460
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any stress we are not able to deal with</v>

196
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.310
<v Speaker 2>will be translated into chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you are not dealing with it,</v>

197
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.940
<v Speaker 2>it will be stored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might stop you right here because</v>

198
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:28.170
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of people that are listening</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this,</v>

199
00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.320
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is Joe Rogan doing on this</v>

200
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:34.740
<v Speaker 2>podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the hell does about you are very</v>

201
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:39.600
<v Speaker 2>unique in that your claims are</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly unusual but substantiated by</v>

202
00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:42.470
<v Speaker 2>science and this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

203
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.560
<v Speaker 2>is not woo science that this is real</v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate researchers have they</v>

204
00:11:48.151 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 2>injected you with what was it they</v>
<v Speaker 2>injected you with,</v>

205
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.580
<v Speaker 2>with an ICO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live bacteria and endotoxemia and</v>

206
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 2>endotoxin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they monitored your immune</v>

207
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:02.971
<v Speaker 2>system and saw that you could actively</v>
<v Speaker 2>force your immune system to fight off</v>

208
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.750
<v Speaker 2>this injection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very specifically within a quarter of</v>

209
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:10.180
<v Speaker 2>our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is something they did not think</v>

210
00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:12.220
<v Speaker 2>was possible until you perform this.</v>

211
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They saw that I was influencing intuity,</v>

212
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.010
<v Speaker 2>so-called autonomous nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then for also for people that did</v>

213
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:23.920
<v Speaker 2>not hear the first podcast you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>achieved.</v>

214
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.670
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's correct if I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 six world records,</v>

215
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including you have the longest time of</v>

216
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:36.841
<v Speaker 2>holding your breath and swimming under a</v>
<v Speaker 2>under ice ocean.</v>

217
00:12:36.861 --> 00:12:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Nice too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

218
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

219
00:12:38.241 --> 00:12:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is fucking incredibly cold water.</v>

220
00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:43.600
<v Speaker 2>We're saltwater freezes over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

221
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you ran marathons basically in your</v>

222
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:53.401
<v Speaker 2>underwear with in his shorts and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>say beyond mit winter.</v>

223
00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:55.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beyond the desert.</v>

224
00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Without drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

225
00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:01.890
<v Speaker 2>No Mater of training because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like running too much and I just do it.</v>

226
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when your house is on fire,</v>

227
00:13:05.801 --> 00:13:07.120
<v Speaker 2>you run fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

228
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.580
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to train them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

229
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.920
<v Speaker 2>And so I know how to tap into this</v>
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline,</v>

230
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.130
<v Speaker 2>a system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the access it debris,</v>

231
00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.510
<v Speaker 2>brainstem to reptilian mode.</v>

232
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.500
<v Speaker 2>I've learned that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I have a lot of friends that have</v>

233

<v Speaker 2>so in case you're listening to this for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time,</v>

247
00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:01.060
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck is this?</v>

248
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that it is again,</v>

249
00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.280
<v Speaker 2>legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a legit Alegent,</v>

250
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:11.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a legit.</v>

251
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.690
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are legends.</v>

252
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a legendary because we go pause,</v>

253
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:20.320
<v Speaker 2>perceive limits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go past the fear and what we perceive</v>

254
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:23.820
<v Speaker 2>as being possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go past that because we pioneered,</v>

255
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:26.830
<v Speaker 2>we go past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would feel created by our</v>

256
00:14:26.831 --> 00:14:30.370
<v Speaker 2>conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever we think is possible,</v>

257
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.110
<v Speaker 2>and we do not dare to go past that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

258
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.720
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

259
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry I didn't ever really do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's funny that your teammate was</v>

260
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Robbins because you hear the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Robbins.</v>

261
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Robbins loves to do those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

262
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.080
<v Speaker 2>walking on fire things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

263
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.850
<v Speaker 2>lately it's been causing problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people pause in the middle and</v>

264
00:14:47.851 --> 00:14:50.260
<v Speaker 2>take selfies and then they want to burn</v>
<v Speaker 2>their feet.</v>

265
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Silly</v>

266
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.280
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So silly.</v>

267
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.550
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had Michael Shermer on who's a noted</v>

268
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:00.810
<v Speaker 3>skeptic and very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very intelligent man.</v>

269
00:15:00.811 --> 00:15:03.810
<v Speaker 3>And he explained what what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>

270
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coals are very poor conductor of</v>

271
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 3>heat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you don't cook right on</v>

272
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:08.720
<v Speaker 3>coals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You use metal.</v>

273
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:11.330
<v Speaker 3>Metal's a great conductor of heat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the metal over the coals,</v>

274
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.810
<v Speaker 3>the metal gets heated up by the Kohl's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that sears your food.</v>

275
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.430
<v Speaker 3>You don't cook on Kohl's themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it doesn't really transmit heat</v>

276
00:15:19.431 --> 00:15:20.810
<v Speaker 3>that well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you can,</v>

277
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.530
<v Speaker 3>for 10 seconds or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can walk over and real quick and you</v>

278
00:15:23.531 --> 00:15:25.860
<v Speaker 3>don't really get that burned unless you</v>
<v Speaker 3>pause for selfies.</v>

279
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:27.760
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

280
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I go back to nature and then you</v>

281
00:15:31.171 --> 00:15:36.171
<v Speaker 2>see before we wore his shoes actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous things,</v>

282
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.790
<v Speaker 2>but we invented them and now we think</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a shiny shoes we have so much more</v>

283
00:15:41.791 --> 00:15:42.624
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

284
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
<v Speaker 2>But shoes do look good though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Choose to and they're colorful shoes and</v>

285
00:15:48.481 --> 00:15:53.481
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very nice but sometimes be more over</v>

286
00:15:53.671 --> 00:15:56.640
<v Speaker 2>because of all these devices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radiation,</v>

287
00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.140
<v Speaker 2>we get to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the nervous system and we charged</v>

288
00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.200
<v Speaker 2>with negative ions and for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

289
00:16:04.201 --> 00:16:08.300
<v Speaker 2>any electricity you need to ground if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got big charts,</v>

290
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:13.301
<v Speaker 2>so it accumulate in the body and</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore I suggest people walk</v>

291
00:16:14.521 --> 00:16:17.760
<v Speaker 2>sometimes just inside of nature now the</v>
<v Speaker 2>all day,</v>

292
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:22.140
<v Speaker 2>but the release,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those negative ions are going to write</v>

293
00:16:22.141 --> 00:16:23.600
<v Speaker 2>something down because I keep forgetting</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

294
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Is that true though,</v>

295
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:32.460
<v Speaker 3>like as far as a negative ions and doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>things to your body,</v>

296
00:16:33.661 --> 00:16:38.200
<v Speaker 3>have they ever found any correlation</v>
<v Speaker 3>between the use of electronics and</v>

297
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.310
<v Speaker 3>negative aspects?</v>

298
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I just feel to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think so?</v>

299
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.720
<v Speaker 2>I always go by my intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thinks at teacher won't approve it,</v>

300
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.220
<v Speaker 2>but I feel a lot better doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do to Kilimanjaro by the</v>

301
00:16:51.221 --> 00:16:52.360
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a bad foot.</v>

302
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man likes a challenge.</v>

303
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.130
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend of mine who went to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bolivia.</v>

304
00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.680
<v Speaker 3>He filmed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a television show called</v>

305
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.150
<v Speaker 3>mediator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His name is Stephen [inaudible].</v>

306
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:07.300
<v Speaker 3>He's a professional hunter and he went</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Bolivia and he lived with the Toumani</v>

307
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.580
<v Speaker 3>for a couple weeks and he brought them</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoes like,</v>

308
00:17:10.581 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

309
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.160
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try these shoes on that.</v>

310
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.750
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want to have nothing to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>with those shoes,</v>

311
00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:17.210
<v Speaker 3>like stupid things out of here because</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people walk barefoot everywhere</v>

312
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.940
<v Speaker 3>and their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said their feet don't look at</v>

313
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.320
<v Speaker 3>anybody's feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

314
00:17:21.321 --> 00:17:24.800
<v Speaker 3>they're all splayed out like their toes</v>
<v Speaker 3>are splayed out and there's like a</v>

315
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:27.320
<v Speaker 3>thick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thick padding underneath.</v>

316
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they're basically have their own</v>

317
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Speaker 3>shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the calluses and the bottom of</v>

318
00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:33.350
<v Speaker 3>their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Act as shoes.</v>

319
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.790
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't sound too attractive for me</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

320
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:42.870
<v Speaker 2>To have to attract abby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have feed like a heart and know what</v>

321
00:17:46.261 --> 00:17:50.280
<v Speaker 2>I do is using my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't want to have callouses on</v>

322
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:51.270
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From what?</v>

323
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.150
<v Speaker 2>I got very soft baby feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you really.</v>

324
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

325
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:59.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife always does a self defeating</v>

326
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.420
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you are going to do this barefoot.</v>

327
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.910
<v Speaker 2>Are you gonna wear shoes at least?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

328
00:18:08.911 --> 00:18:09.181
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

329
00:18:09.181 --> 00:18:10.580
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not paying like that.</v>

330
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Your colleges to go once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind over matter.</v>

331
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about frostbite?</v>

332
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.580
<v Speaker 2>And I did the half marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barefoot.</v>

333
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.760
<v Speaker 2>You did beyond the Polish circles in</v>
<v Speaker 2>temperatures even far more below than</v>

334
00:18:25.821 --> 00:18:28.560
<v Speaker 2>the Kilimanjaro is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

335
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.640
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's any benefit from the fact that</v>

336
00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:36.360
<v Speaker 2>you're walking so much or running and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your body is heating up and maybe</v>

337
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:38.730
<v Speaker 2>that has a positive effect on your skin.</v>

338
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is I'm very able to,</v>

339
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go away and to tap into the hormonal</v>

340
00:18:45.481 --> 00:18:49.890
<v Speaker 2>system creating adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

341
00:18:49.891 --> 00:18:53.430
<v Speaker 2>this fact where people are sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>refer to,</v>

342
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:59.030
<v Speaker 2>they lift up and mother because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>child is underneath that actually is the</v>

343
00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:03.390
<v Speaker 2>mind staring directly into the reptilian</v>
<v Speaker 2>mode.</v>

344
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.730
<v Speaker 2>The reptilian brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the primitive brain and that</v>

345
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:12.030
<v Speaker 2>you have direct access to pure</v>
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline,</v>

346
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:17.210
<v Speaker 2>makes you able to do almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>inconceivable a feet and accomplish it.</v>

347
00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Only one tear right trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

348
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.460
<v Speaker 2>because I have been so much into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold,</v>

349
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:28.740
<v Speaker 2>cold is cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a real force impact upon you,</v>

350
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:34.080
<v Speaker 2>so you need to learn how to connect</v>
<v Speaker 2>within with your mind and you're</v>

351
00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:37.320
<v Speaker 2>breathing into the brainstem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into this adrenaline,</v>

352
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.320
<v Speaker 2>to withstand this force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cold impact.</v>

353
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I've learned it so you're tapping in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain,</v>

354
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:48.060
<v Speaker 2>you're causing your body to produce more</v>
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline and you're focusing on the</v>

355
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:50.370
<v Speaker 2>areas of your body that are contacting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the snow,</v>

356
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:52.170
<v Speaker 2>like you're focusing on the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your feet.</v>

357
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

358
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.690
<v Speaker 2>And it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

359
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm still able to look around now it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sunset or the sunrise and and be.</v>

360
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.300
<v Speaker 2>So there is a margin even there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

361
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:08.520
<v Speaker 2>We just need to go back to belief and</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelief.</v>

362
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.790
<v Speaker 2>There in means the neurotransmitters and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the neurons.</v>

363
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Those are signals and say churches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you charge a,</v>

364
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:23.100
<v Speaker 2>a buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then if you're able to influence up to</v>

365
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:28.980
<v Speaker 2>DNA level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have proven this already,</v>

366
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:34.400
<v Speaker 2>but the aisle six enter location</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to safe inflammation,</v>

367
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.130
<v Speaker 2>we could not find it off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could not suppressed decide to cast</v>

368
00:20:39.131 --> 00:20:43.480
<v Speaker 2>the flammatory markers and we showed</v>
<v Speaker 2>very effectively not me,</v>

369
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.770
<v Speaker 2>only a whole group of persons which are</v>
<v Speaker 2>trained just four days</v>

370
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.100
<v Speaker 4>to be able to go into the DNA and create</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right chemistry consciously by</v>

371
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:59.281
<v Speaker 4>breathing and using the mind to fend off</v>
<v Speaker 4>flammatory markers a caused by,</v>

372
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.540
<v Speaker 4>say a bacteria inside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we are actually able to tap into the</v>

373
00:21:07.751 --> 00:21:10.970
<v Speaker 4>deepest of ours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>create a,</v>

374
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.990
<v Speaker 4>have control over adrenaline's trestle</v>
<v Speaker 4>and go up to not only in the deepest</v>

375
00:21:16.271 --> 00:21:19.150
<v Speaker 4>part of the brain but also in the DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

376
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:20.950
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got interesting thing.</v>

377
00:21:20.951 --> 00:21:23.650
<v Speaker 4>So let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The last time I believe you,</v>

378
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.950
<v Speaker 4>you've got a pile of notes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it about breathing?</v>

379
00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.440
<v Speaker 4>What is it about breathing or his</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathing?</v>

380
00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:33.460
<v Speaker 4>Just one component of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it breathing and also focusing on</v>

381
00:21:33.461 --> 00:21:35.200
<v Speaker 4>what you're trying to accomplish?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

382
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.920
<v Speaker 4>focus absolutely works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me explain a little about,</v>

383
00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about breathing.</v>

384
00:21:40.391 --> 00:21:43.720
<v Speaker 4>Breathing is chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oxygen has chemistry in the body,</v>

385
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:49.470
<v Speaker 4>so if y'all are able to access,</v>
<v Speaker 4>energize the cells more than we do</v>

386
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.710
<v Speaker 4>normally because we talked about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>lymphatic system and the tissue,</v>

387
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:59.130
<v Speaker 4>and actually the body's able to store up</v>
<v Speaker 4>more oxygen than the 100 percent.</v>

388
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.230
<v Speaker 4>We presumed a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

389
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.500
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scientifically,</v>

390
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.240
<v Speaker 4>we are able to store up more oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Eva breathing technique,</v>

391
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:15.241
<v Speaker 4>whatever breathing technique is able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>store up more oxygen in the south,</v>

392
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.970
<v Speaker 4>that means go into the tissue going into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lymphatic system.</v>

393
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.340
<v Speaker 4>Then suddenly the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

394
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:26.341
<v Speaker 4>the chemistry becomes alkaline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The asset gets out of the body at will,</v>

395
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:30.610
<v Speaker 4>and then the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mind is positive,</v>

396
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.330
<v Speaker 4>a little electrical charges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>neurotransmitters,</v>

397
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:39.870
<v Speaker 4>and they are suddenly able to connect in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a buddy and you enabling you to have</v>

398
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:45.610
<v Speaker 4>control,</v>
<v Speaker 4>direct all the systems in the body.</v>

399
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:50.880
<v Speaker 4>That's the way nature Amanda to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the mind a mind is conditioned to be</v>

400
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:54.970
<v Speaker 4>effective in the body is making the</v>
<v Speaker 4>body,</v>

401
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by breath,</v>

402
00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.740
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathing profound breathing in an</v>

403
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.430
<v Speaker 4>alkaline state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then these electrical signals are able</v>

404
00:23:03.431 --> 00:23:08.431
<v Speaker 4>to travel through out and the way nature</v>
<v Speaker 4>meant it to be is that we are able to</v>

405
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:12.820
<v Speaker 4>direct any part of the body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the immune system,</v>

406
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.490
<v Speaker 4>endocrine system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lymphatic system,</v>

407
00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:20.140
<v Speaker 4>vasculars older systems where we told a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit last time,</v>

408
00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:25.060
<v Speaker 4>but I got more direct evidence now and</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now we are working with the</v>

409
00:23:25.061 --> 00:23:30.061
<v Speaker 4>universities on the brain and say</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotional reactivity and they see</v>

410
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:36.300
<v Speaker 4>incredible things that we actually are</v>
<v Speaker 4>able to get into those places where</v>

411
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.420
<v Speaker 4>emotion exists and we think emotion.</v>

412
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.620
<v Speaker 4>Where is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where is it,</v>

413
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:46.950
<v Speaker 4>but at this translated also as something</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemical so they can measure motion and</v>

414
00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:49.170
<v Speaker 4>the chemical form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

415
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:51.030
<v Speaker 4>What are they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are they measuring it?</v>

416
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 4>They they go into say a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hypothalamus,</v>

417
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.440
<v Speaker 4>hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hippocampus,</v>

418
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.160
<v Speaker 4>Amygdala.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are the places where this</v>

419
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:04.400
<v Speaker 4>chemistry is going on and we had no way</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get into that.</v>

420
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.850
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you are able to access those parts</v>

421
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:12.050
<v Speaker 4>and to pressurize with breathing</v>
<v Speaker 4>techniques into those parts,</v>

422
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:16.280
<v Speaker 4>then suddenly you feel you begin to cry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

423
00:24:16.281 --> 00:24:20.390
<v Speaker 4>Because the chemistry is changing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are dealing with the chemistry which</v>

424
00:24:20.391 --> 00:24:25.391
<v Speaker 4>was stored up because she couldn't work</v>
<v Speaker 4>it up before and now you're able to tap</v>

425
00:24:25.851 --> 00:24:28.070
<v Speaker 4>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>change the chemistry,</v>

426
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.790
<v Speaker 4>and that that's the function.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

427
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:35.830
<v Speaker 4>you are not able to deal with it now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So later when you have peace and you are</v>

428
00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.800
<v Speaker 4>a somewhere no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not stressful,</v>

429
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.150
<v Speaker 4>then work on it and breathing does it.</v>

430
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.640
<v Speaker 4>It brought into it positively influences</v>
<v Speaker 4>the chemistry in the,</v>

431
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.560
<v Speaker 4>in the depth of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

432
00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:56.561
<v Speaker 4>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You create 25 percent more blood flow</v>

433
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.130
<v Speaker 4>and blood flow is with oxygen through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through your breathing.</v>

434
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.350
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

435
00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.280
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense because your blood is</v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

436
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.110
<v Speaker 4>It's carrying oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

437
00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.830
<v Speaker 4>So the more oxygen you provide your</v>
<v Speaker 4>blood and you are definitely providing</v>

438
00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:13.520
<v Speaker 4>it more with these big long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep breaths and these techniques that</v>

439
00:25:13.521 --> 00:25:15.200
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you pursue.</v>

440
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.350
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>manipulating the spine,</v>

441
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.870
<v Speaker 4>the central nervous system up to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>tunnel of the light or the brain.</v>

442
00:25:22.871 --> 00:25:27.830
<v Speaker 4>Stem is a top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if your pressure rise after inhaling,</v>

443
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:31.310
<v Speaker 4>exhaling like we did last time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you did about three minutes,</v>

444
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:34.370
<v Speaker 4>almost a without in the lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very good.</v>

445
00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:39.380
<v Speaker 4>First round is very promising for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>next rounds because you get more and</v>

446
00:25:39.381 --> 00:25:43.340
<v Speaker 4>more oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it only to show that you are able to</v>

447
00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:47.840
<v Speaker 4>store up oxygen far more than you ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>used before,</v>

448
00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:52.910
<v Speaker 4>so in case when you need it to regulate</v>
<v Speaker 4>the chemistry inside the body,</v>

449
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:54.650
<v Speaker 4>then it needs oxygen.</v>

450
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:59.680
<v Speaker 4>Then you we are all able with these</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathing exercises to get it anywhere</v>

451
00:26:00.171 --> 00:26:05.171
<v Speaker 4>where the chemistry is messed up and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemistry messed up,</v>

452
00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:10.660
<v Speaker 4>we'll send off a signal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we are not emotionally not listening</v>

453
00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:15.350
<v Speaker 4>because we get a worries and we need to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do the deadline and this and that so we</v>

454
00:26:15.351 --> 00:26:20.351
<v Speaker 4>are not a chemistry stays over there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>will deregulate the system and then we</v>

455
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:25.490
<v Speaker 4>become sick and we don't know what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

456
00:26:25.491 --> 00:26:30.491
<v Speaker 4>We go to the doctor and a psychiatrist</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we become depressed and all,</v>

457
00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:37.300
<v Speaker 4>but we are very able to get into any</v>
<v Speaker 4>place in the body and in this case,</v>

458
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 4>the brain where we do all these studies</v>

459
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:49.220
<v Speaker 2>now with the university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say cognitive therapy just talking</v>

460
00:26:49.591 --> 00:26:52.950
<v Speaker 2>to each other in the psychology and</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy.</v>

461
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:57.240
<v Speaker 2>That's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a conference with 200 experts</v>

462
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.270
<v Speaker 2>and they did this breathing and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

463
00:27:00.271 --> 00:27:01.150
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

464
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking a only as not enough,</v>

465
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:09.300
<v Speaker 2>but if you do this breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you really get into the brain.</v>

466
00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:13.860
<v Speaker 2>Now suddenly you get a sense of control</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're creating this extra</v>

467
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:17.580
<v Speaker 2>circulation of blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes to together with oxygen,</v>

468
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 2>making it alkaline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then suddenly the blockage is created</v>

469
00:27:22.201 --> 00:27:26.340
<v Speaker 2>because of wrong chemistry because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>trauma or uh,</v>

470
00:27:26.341 --> 00:27:29.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety or grief.</v>

471
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Then suddenly that chemistry is being</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealt with and you get balanced.</v>

472
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.180
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we keep it simple.</v>

473
00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

474
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.190
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to get this web of our thoughts</v>

475
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:47.490
<v Speaker 2>thinking of so many difficulties and</v>
<v Speaker 2>complications.</v>

476
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:49.590
<v Speaker 2>What is emotion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is fair?</v>

477
00:27:49.591 --> 00:27:51.870
<v Speaker 2>What is PTSD?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is trauma?</v>

478
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.020
<v Speaker 2>What is depression?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know where it is in the brain.</v>

479
00:27:55.290 --> 00:28:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Just get all the brain full of oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get get to alkalinity up and you are</v>

480
00:28:01.591 --> 00:28:04.800
<v Speaker 2>able to steer by going through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>spine,</v>

481
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.100
<v Speaker 2>up in your head and do it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>

482
00:28:08.101 --> 00:28:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Why do you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that why some studies have shown that</v>

483
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.550
<v Speaker 2>rigorous exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly cardio like running a</v>

484
00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:17.640
<v Speaker 2>elliptical machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines are just as</v>

485
00:28:17.641 --> 00:28:21.300
<v Speaker 2>good for depression as medication?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

486
00:28:21.301 --> 00:28:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

487
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:27.790
<v Speaker 2>it's dealing with the oxygen tension is</v>
<v Speaker 2>forcing when you think those giant deep</v>

488
00:28:28.321 --> 00:28:30.360
<v Speaker 2>breaths you take when you're jogging or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

489
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.493
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

490
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:36.980
<v Speaker 2>When you do those things to you actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>create the body to be effective with the</v>

491
00:28:39.271 --> 00:28:42.420
<v Speaker 2>oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then suddenly different mechanisms are</v>

492
00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:43.670
<v Speaker 2>at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

493
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:48.740
<v Speaker 2>more oxygen is coming in and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemistry is balancing out a depression</v>

494
00:28:50.041 --> 00:28:52.860
<v Speaker 2>is caused by a wrong chemistry.</v>

495
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Creating inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

496
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a regular exerciser,</v>

497
00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.600
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes I just get real busy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

498
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.850
<v Speaker 2>I take a couple of days off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I take couple of days off and</v>

499
00:29:02.851 --> 00:29:04.800
<v Speaker 2>I just don't feel right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

500
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not a self indulgent person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes I'll just feel like,</v>

501
00:29:08.671 --> 00:29:09.690
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

502
00:29:09.691 --> 00:29:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I just feel kind of shitty today or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

503
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:14.490
<v Speaker 2>And then I forced myself to exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

504
00:29:14.491 --> 00:29:16.450
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get up an hour early or I</v>

505
00:29:16.451 --> 00:29:17.970
<v Speaker 2>want to do whatever I have to do and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to,</v>

506
00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:19.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I go to bed,</v>

507
00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:21.390
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make sure that the day will</v>

508
00:29:21.391 --> 00:29:25.530
<v Speaker 2>not end until I exercise and when I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that goes away,</v>

509
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.200
<v Speaker 2>the feelings go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like have a new brain.</v>

510
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like I leave there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm smiling and laughing,</v>

511
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like everything is just</v>

512
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:36.240
<v Speaker 2>beautiful again and that's you and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm the same person,</v>

513
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:41.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like my life has the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that my life is bad in way.</v>

514
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 2>My life is fantastic.</v>

515
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.420
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all great stuff,</v>

516
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.320
<v Speaker 3>but just being a person sometimes being</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person is overwhelming.</v>

517
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:48.980
<v Speaker 3>You're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you're,</v>

518
00:29:48.981 --> 00:29:52.090
<v Speaker 3>you have a lot of obligations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot on your plate.</v>

519
00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:54.310
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things going on and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's overwhelming.</v>

520
00:29:54.311 --> 00:29:57.760
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you just feel down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

521
00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.780
<v Speaker 3>and I have a good life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very fun life.</v>

522
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.150
<v Speaker 3>If I didn't have a fun life and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>

523
00:30:04.151 --> 00:30:07.030
<v Speaker 3>it would just be compounding all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other issues that I have now.</v>

524
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:12.300
<v Speaker 3>Tack on that if I was overweight tack on</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if I was on hooked on pills or I</v>

525
00:30:13.181 --> 00:30:16.930
<v Speaker 3>was an alcoholic or cigarette smoking or</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the other things that are really</v>

526
00:30:16.931 --> 00:30:18.730
<v Speaker 3>terrible for you that so many people</v>
<v Speaker 3>suffer from,</v>

527
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.040
<v Speaker 3>if all those things you don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

528
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:26.080
<v Speaker 3>I think there's so many people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of depression or bad states of</v>

529
00:30:26.081 --> 00:30:31.081
<v Speaker 3>mind as being just something that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are a hand that you're dealt and it's.</v>

530
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily think it's the case</v>

531
00:30:34.211 --> 00:30:36.670
<v Speaker 3>with everybody because I don't know how</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's mind works,</v>

532
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.940
<v Speaker 3>but I know certainly from my mind I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely regulate those ups and downs</v>

533
00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.900
<v Speaker 3>based on rigorous exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't have to be lifting</v>

534
00:30:46.901 --> 00:30:49.840
<v Speaker 3>weights or crossfit or Jujitsu or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything crazy.</v>

535
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.020
<v Speaker 3>Just go walk up a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just go hike,</v>

536
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.903
<v Speaker 3>just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hike,</v>

537
00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.960
<v Speaker 3>go hike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take those big deep breaths.</v>

538
00:30:55.961 --> 00:30:58.420
<v Speaker 3>You get to the top of that hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking feel great.</v>

539
00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good.</v>

540
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.250
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

541
00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.740
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do that too.</v>

542
00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do it,</v>

543
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:05.530
<v Speaker 3>you do it in your underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

544
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:06.364
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

545
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:07.840
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

546
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Go to the experiment and show that it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>all possible.</v>

547
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:16.680
<v Speaker 3>Even in the most extreme conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm at the knocking at the door,</v>

548
00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:23.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of science and I feel I'm able to help.</v>

549
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>science very much interested in what</v>

550
00:31:26.831 --> 00:31:27.550
<v Speaker 3>you're doing.</v>

551
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Yes they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The scientific community embraced this,</v>

552
00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.690
<v Speaker 3>but I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

553
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm able actually to help a human men</v>
<v Speaker 3>card.</v>

554
00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so extraordinary that one person</v>

555
00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:42.210
<v Speaker 3>has this kind of influenced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

556
00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:46.890
<v Speaker 3>I hope you realize what a service you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>providing to people because you're</v>

557
00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:50.350
<v Speaker 3>bringing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing awareness.</v>

558
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Well thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm doing is just talking to someone</v>

559
00:31:53.051 --> 00:31:55.050
<v Speaker 3>who's awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this,</v>

560
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.390
<v Speaker 3>this thing that you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would think that other people would</v>

561
00:31:58.391 --> 00:32:01.240
<v Speaker 3>have figured it out and that's what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>find most fascinating about you.</v>

562
00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.370
<v Speaker 3>I would have thought that last time you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were here.</v>

563
00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:04.204
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

564
00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.530
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to believe there are so few</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that have done what you've done</v>

565
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:11.140
<v Speaker 3>or figured out what you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you figured out,</v>

566
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:15.640
<v Speaker 3>and then even more unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you've done is you've gone to</v>

567
00:32:15.641 --> 00:32:17.590
<v Speaker 3>scientists and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

568
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.020
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm onto something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please study me.</v>

569
00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:21.970
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please study what I'm doing.</v>

570
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.910
<v Speaker 3>And you got people to listen to you by</v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplishing all these incredible</v>

571
00:32:24.911 --> 00:32:25.480
<v Speaker 3>feats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go,</v>

572
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:25.991
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

573
00:32:25.991 --> 00:32:27.750
<v Speaker 3>obviously he's doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

574
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.510
<v Speaker 3>who the fucking swim 100 yards under</v>
<v Speaker 3>frozen ice in one breath.</v>

575
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:36.750
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck is running marathons</v>
<v Speaker 3>barefoot above the polar circle?</v>

576
00:32:37.031 --> 00:32:39.050
<v Speaker 3>All this shit that you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

577
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's wonderful.</v>

578
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.350
<v Speaker 4>It's forcing people to acknowledge the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that something extraordinary is</v>

579
00:32:45.351 --> 00:32:46.820
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it is.</v>

580
00:32:46.821 --> 00:32:49.700
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got big problems and issues with</v>

581
00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:51.560
<v Speaker 4>people with PTSD,</v>
<v Speaker 4>depression,</v>

582
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:52.430
<v Speaker 4>trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fear,</v>

583
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:55.220
<v Speaker 4>anxiety in general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all stress,</v>

584
00:32:55.221 --> 00:32:58.190
<v Speaker 4>stress hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now using the,</v>

585
00:32:58.191 --> 00:32:59.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

586
00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:02.150
<v Speaker 4>developing a method and finding it out</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I</v>

587
00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.980
<v Speaker 4>was in this quest to go deeper within</v>
<v Speaker 4>myself,</v>

588
00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.051
<v Speaker 4>finding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

589
00:33:08.051 --> 00:33:09.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

590
00:33:09.061 --> 00:33:14.061
<v Speaker 4>the cold as the right teacher to bring</v>
<v Speaker 4>me into the depth of my physiology.</v>

591
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:18.770
<v Speaker 4>Finally finding a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way nature meant me to be,</v>

592
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:24.190
<v Speaker 4>to feel strong and in control of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I brought this now,</v>

593
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:25.580
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to side.</v>

594
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:30.910
<v Speaker 4>And now it is a matter of time that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>will resolve what we have lost the</v>

595
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:38.080
<v Speaker 4>connection with the depth of ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that means for people maybe not for</v>

596
00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:41.540
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you are able to handle your mood</v>

597
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.680
<v Speaker 4>and your physical strength and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>health.</v>

598
00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.920
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But for those who have ptsd,</v>

599
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.480
<v Speaker 4>trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anxiety,</v>

600
00:33:50.481 --> 00:33:51.650
<v Speaker 4>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>depression,</v>

601
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.200
<v Speaker 4>our immune diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer,</v>

602
00:33:55.190 --> 00:34:00.190
<v Speaker 4>all these things I think nature knows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I found these keys in a nature.</v>

603
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.110
<v Speaker 4>I just bring it to the science and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>forgot about the nature.</v>

604
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:11.950
<v Speaker 4>And this is where I wear a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>note.</v>

605
00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:14.320
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

606
00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:14.770
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

607
00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:18.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we are able not only to show that the</v>

608
00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:20.870
<v Speaker 4>autonomous nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hormonal system,</v>

609
00:34:20.871 --> 00:34:24.050
<v Speaker 4>the immune system can be influenced</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeply,</v>

610
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:28.060
<v Speaker 4>that means hormone or system that is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Melatonin,</v>

611
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:33.070
<v Speaker 4>Serotonin and dopamine and any feel good</v>
<v Speaker 4>hormone within us and the ability to tap</v>

612
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.210
<v Speaker 4>into that system and create those</v>
<v Speaker 4>hormones when necessary.</v>

613
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:42.860
<v Speaker 4>When you feel bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just go get a shot naturally by</v>

614
00:34:42.861 --> 00:34:47.630
<v Speaker 4>breathing unbelieving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have the right hormones and you feel</v>

615
00:34:47.631 --> 00:34:48.980
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

616
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.610
<v Speaker 4>And then you got the strength,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is also based on hormones,</v>

617
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.700
<v Speaker 4>hormonal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hormonal,</v>

618
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:57.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>secretions like adrenaline,</v>

619
00:34:57.471 --> 00:34:59.740
<v Speaker 4>epinephrine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cortisol,</v>

620
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:04.160
<v Speaker 4>a dose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we show people lying in bed as I</v>

621
00:35:04.161 --> 00:35:06.480
<v Speaker 4>taught last.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That tap embed,</v>

622
00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.640
<v Speaker 4>embed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>producing more adrenaline controlled</v>

623
00:35:10.641 --> 00:35:14.030
<v Speaker 4>stress or more than somebody going into</v>
<v Speaker 4>a inferior,</v>

624
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:18.400
<v Speaker 4>going into its first banking job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That means controlled stress hormone,</v>

625
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.060
<v Speaker 4>adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 4>adrenaline,</v>

626
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:23.730
<v Speaker 4>which is controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stress Hormone works like Madison.</v>

627
00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:28.830
<v Speaker 4>And either it brings you back to the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>nature made us most effective in</v>

628
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.950
<v Speaker 4>situations of danger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could be cold,</v>

629
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:37.870
<v Speaker 4>the extreme cold heat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be being credited by the light</v>

630
00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.340
<v Speaker 4>control,</v>

631
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.880
<v Speaker 2>like a werewolf or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

632
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real and</v>

633
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:50.750
<v Speaker 2>I think in society moves even bigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the one I saw you.</v>

634
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:54.350
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is a big shocks you</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet?</v>

635
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.210
<v Speaker 2>You use an analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you don't think that people</v>

636
00:35:57.211 --> 00:35:58.490
<v Speaker 2>really turned to wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks,</v>

637
00:35:58.850 --> 00:35:59.201
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

638
00:35:59.201 --> 00:35:59.520
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

639
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.720
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>

640
00:36:00.721 --> 00:36:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Only in Hollywood and a lie can tropes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and old.</v>

641
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Very nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very nice,</v>

642
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.470
<v Speaker 2>very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

643
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.910
<v Speaker 2>it a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a beautiful,</v>

644
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.580
<v Speaker 2>beautiful piece of art and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

645
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:21.240
<v Speaker 2>that's the strength part and that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to,</v>

646
00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the health part,</v>

647
00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:26.910
<v Speaker 2>that immune system and all its layers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me ask you this,</v>

648
00:36:26.911 --> 00:36:30.060
<v Speaker 2>because adrenaline with fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

649
00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.790
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is considered to be a very dangerous</v>

650
00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:36.480
<v Speaker 2>thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to manage because there's a thing called</v>

651
00:36:36.481 --> 00:36:38.940
<v Speaker 2>the adrenaline dump that happens to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of fighters.</v>

652
00:36:38.941 --> 00:36:42.300
<v Speaker 2>So they get so worked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so jazzed up before a fight and</v>

653
00:36:42.301 --> 00:36:46.770
<v Speaker 2>then they're in the fight and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around the first round the</v>

654
00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:50.040
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline goes away and they have this</v>
<v Speaker 2>dump and they get exhausted.</v>

655
00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.513
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

656
00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:54.840
<v Speaker 2>that's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called adrenaline dump and it</v>

657
00:36:54.841 --> 00:36:56.460
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean they're under extreme</v>

658
00:36:56.461 --> 00:37:00.030
<v Speaker 2>stressful situations in guys gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd they get very tired very quickly</v>

659
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.400
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of them talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe how tired I got and</v>

660
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:07.980
<v Speaker 2>it's attributed to adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

661
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:10.960
<v Speaker 2>but that then is no control over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline,</v>

662
00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.490
<v Speaker 2>so bright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they allow it to run away from them.</v>

663
00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:16.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like that old expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the.</v>

664
00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.310
<v Speaker 2>There was a very famous custom motto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Expression customer was the guy who</v>

665
00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:21.690
<v Speaker 2>trained Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

666
00:37:21.691 --> 00:37:25.470
<v Speaker 2>fire can be your friend or it can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>your enemy can cook your food or it can</v>

667
00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:28.060
<v Speaker 2>burn your house down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how you control it.</v>

668
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:33.600
<v Speaker 2>It's all very interesting to defining</v>
<v Speaker 2>modus of ours,</v>

669
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:36.270
<v Speaker 2>which is related to the fight mode is</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

670
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.640
<v Speaker 2>flight food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>priests and fuck,</v>

671
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.200
<v Speaker 2>that's the brainstem.</v>

672
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all the same energy.</v>

673
00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:43.840
<v Speaker 2>It's oldest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

674
00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.910
<v Speaker 2>managing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

675
00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:47.190
<v Speaker 2>Procreation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Protect your children.</v>

676
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Primal,</v>

677
00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:53.160
<v Speaker 2>primal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The primal forces are directly related</v>

678
00:37:53.161 --> 00:37:58.161
<v Speaker 2>to adrenaline and we lost a control</v>
<v Speaker 2>there over because we lost the deeper</v>

679
00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:00.400
<v Speaker 2>connection with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

680
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.470
<v Speaker 2>with that system within our brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brainstem.</v>

681
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:10.040
<v Speaker 2>And therefore we do not know how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>handle danger anymore as such,</v>

682
00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:15.570
<v Speaker 2>danger is not only cold and a heat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen deprivation as a,</v>

683
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:19.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>situations like Mount Everest or</v>

684
00:38:19.681 --> 00:38:22.430
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also daily stress.</v>

685
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:26.950
<v Speaker 2>It's also things seeing things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>carry with them extreme consequences or</v>

686
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.840
<v Speaker 2>you get nervous and you get freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

687
00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:34.110
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's for people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't in situations that are very</v>

688
00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:35.740
<v Speaker 2>stressful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very often</v>

689
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.010
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a huge issue and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes can't control their</v>

690
00:38:39.011 --> 00:38:40.840
<v Speaker 3>adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't control their anxiety,</v>

691
00:38:40.841 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 3>they can't control that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even their own thoughts.</v>

692
00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:48.010
<v Speaker 3>They get tunnel vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're in an elevator as the</v>

693
00:38:48.011 --> 00:38:50.440
<v Speaker 3>doors are closing shot and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>

694
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:56.430
<v Speaker 3>You literally see it in fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see people panic and that panic does</v>

695
00:38:56.681 --> 00:39:01.330
<v Speaker 3>not allow them to be present,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which does not allow them to perform at</v>

696
00:39:01.331 --> 00:39:02.800
<v Speaker 3>their very best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're almost,</v>

697
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.660
<v Speaker 3>they're almost always severely</v>
<v Speaker 3>diminished because of that adrenaline or</v>

698
00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:09.100
<v Speaker 3>because of that panic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say,</v>

699
00:39:09.101 --> 00:39:11.350
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily the adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

700
00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:16.530
<v Speaker 3>the loss of management,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loss of loss of your ability to be</v>

701
00:39:18.611 --> 00:39:19.680
<v Speaker 3>sovereign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

702
00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 3>you're not in control anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're being carried away by a wave of</v>

703
00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:23.650
<v Speaker 3>fear.</v>

704
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:28.030
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I ideal with her sports people.</v>

705
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:31.320
<v Speaker 4>He did a lot of work with allister over</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and many more,</v>

706
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:34.070
<v Speaker 4>many more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm uh,</v>

707
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:39.090
<v Speaker 4>in general when they do the breathing</v>
<v Speaker 4>exercises and the cold exposure,</v>

708
00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:44.540
<v Speaker 4>deb has become just more energetic and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a lot more connection with</v>

709
00:39:44.681 --> 00:39:48.490
<v Speaker 4>their own body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the creating confidence within</v>

710
00:39:48.491 --> 00:39:51.800
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they are able to build up this</v>

711
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.990
<v Speaker 4>connection mind body and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

712
00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:00.040
<v Speaker 4>they are cardio increases their</v>
<v Speaker 4>tranquility.</v>

713
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had some great results with the</v>

714
00:40:02.281 --> 00:40:06.280
<v Speaker 3>Alastar let me tell you that because he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was on a downward spiral</v>

715
00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.350
<v Speaker 4>or you started working with us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of come to Kilimanjaro to,</v>

716
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:14.470
<v Speaker 4>because I need to train them again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he lost track a little bit on</v>

717
00:40:14.571 --> 00:40:19.571
<v Speaker 4>the breathing exercises and he thought</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was already there.</v>

718
00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.810
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I talked to,</v>

719
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:24.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>

720
00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:27.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we will go to the Kilimanjaro.</v>

721
00:40:27.261 --> 00:40:28.590
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will say,</v>

722
00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:30.050
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

723
00:40:30.051 --> 00:40:34.280
<v Speaker 4>you have to breathe here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will understand the significance of</v>

724
00:40:34.281 --> 00:40:39.281
<v Speaker 4>breeding and now to take a to lightly go</v>
<v Speaker 4>back into yourself and do not think you</v>

725
00:40:41.841 --> 00:40:45.980
<v Speaker 4>are there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be there and the mountain.</v>

726
00:40:45.981 --> 00:40:49.100
<v Speaker 4>The mother nature will show you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not me.</v>

727
00:40:49.101 --> 00:40:54.101
<v Speaker 4>I just know to abide by the laws of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mother Nature and that's why I do these</v>

728
00:40:54.441 --> 00:40:59.441
<v Speaker 4>feet there and it makes me able to adapt</v>
<v Speaker 4>very rapidly to changes in like a cold</v>

729
00:41:01.911 --> 00:41:05.020
<v Speaker 4>heat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oxygen deprivation situations,</v>

730
00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:10.090
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's there and a mother nature will</v>

731
00:41:10.761 --> 00:41:11.510
<v Speaker 4>teach them.</v>

732
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.180
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think that he stopped doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

733
00:41:14.181 --> 00:41:16.010
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What gives you that indication?</v>

734
00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.950
<v Speaker 4>There's a certain moment people think I</v>
<v Speaker 4>control,</v>

735
00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:26.960
<v Speaker 4>I can control it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can do it and I'm in a positive spiral</v>

736
00:41:26.961 --> 00:41:31.961
<v Speaker 4>going up and it's all okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they leave this connection and they</v>

737
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:36.230
<v Speaker 4>fall back into old patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The old neurology,</v>

738
00:41:36.231 --> 00:41:41.231
<v Speaker 4>the old conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they require daily practice until</v>

739
00:41:41.691 --> 00:41:46.691
<v Speaker 4>it's really mastered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it takes how many years it takes to</v>

740
00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:50.780
<v Speaker 4>condition your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A really to,</v>

741
00:41:50.781 --> 00:41:53.460
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to become really so good to be in,</v>

742
00:41:53.461 --> 00:41:54.350
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>k one.</v>

743
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:59.380
<v Speaker 4>And I'm a at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes years to build that up.</v>

744
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:06.100
<v Speaker 4>But it's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He will compete with people who also</v>

745
00:42:06.381 --> 00:42:11.381
<v Speaker 4>conditioned their bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's a eagle thing going up and what</v>

746
00:42:11.661 --> 00:42:15.890
<v Speaker 4>makes the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the connection of your mind with</v>

747
00:42:15.891 --> 00:42:18.530
<v Speaker 4>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your brainstem,</v>

748
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:23.540
<v Speaker 4>with your conscious will and the body</v>
<v Speaker 4>controlling the adrenaline,</v>

749
00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.730
<v Speaker 4>not only auto painter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>friend,</v>

750
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.910
<v Speaker 4>noradrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dopamine,</v>

751
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:29.893
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

752
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.800
<v Speaker 4>Now when you're watching someone like</v>
<v Speaker 4>alister fight and he just fought for the</v>

753
00:42:33.801 --> 00:42:37.820
<v Speaker 4>UFC heavyweight title and came very</v>
<v Speaker 4>close to winning a couple of times in</v>

754
00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:42.620
<v Speaker 4>that first round and wind up losing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What makes you think that breathing</v>

755
00:42:42.621 --> 00:42:45.080
<v Speaker 4>could have helped him in that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he almost won the fight.</v>

756
00:42:45.081 --> 00:42:48.200
<v Speaker 4>He almost knocked pay out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He almost caught him in a guillotine</v>

757
00:42:48.201 --> 00:42:49.034
<v Speaker 4>choke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

758
00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:53.390
<v Speaker 4>and he had Steve Bay and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>trouble on two separate occasions than</v>

759
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:55.250
<v Speaker 4>Steve Bay caught him and knocked him</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

760
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.920
<v Speaker 4>What makes you think that breathing</v>
<v Speaker 4>would have helped him?</v>

761
00:42:57.921 --> 00:43:02.330
<v Speaker 4>Their breathing</v>
<v Speaker 4>brings in oxygen.</v>

762
00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:07.780
<v Speaker 4>Oxygen makes buddy alkalotic the nervous</v>
<v Speaker 4>system that that is a nervous system,</v>

763
00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:15.040
<v Speaker 4>goes better when it is alkaline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The swiftness of neurotransmitters,</v>

764
00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:22.730
<v Speaker 4>which is a neurotransmitter in the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes the body react like Bruce Lee</v>

765
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:24.470
<v Speaker 4>Taylor again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say the word again,</v>

766
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:28.790
<v Speaker 4>I'll say till Hollinger as a teal</v>
<v Speaker 4>collide.</v>

767
00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.080
<v Speaker 4>Acetylcholine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

768
00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.660
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yes.</v>

769
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:39.130
<v Speaker 4>What I do all the time with people or</v>
<v Speaker 4>women who are not able to do pushups,</v>

770
00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:43.550
<v Speaker 4>I make them do the breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>influence,</v>

771
00:43:43.551 --> 00:43:46.310
<v Speaker 4>muscle tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making it alkaline.</v>

772
00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:48.920
<v Speaker 4>So the neurotransmitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the performance,</v>

773
00:43:48.921 --> 00:43:51.980
<v Speaker 4>newer terms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>motors suddenly is able to keep on</v>

774
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:55.580
<v Speaker 4>because it's not becoming acidic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you say acidic and alkaline,</v>

775
00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:57.590
<v Speaker 4>what are you measuring?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you measuring blood?</v>

776
00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.980
<v Speaker 4>Are you measuring muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>muscle tissue?</v>

777
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:03.640
<v Speaker 4>How are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

778
00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.180
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

779
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:10.240
<v Speaker 4>but with a simple ph strip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can show yourself,</v>

780
00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:16.790
<v Speaker 4>say before e five a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and who's doing these tests as</v>

781
00:44:16.791 --> 00:44:17.930
<v Speaker 4>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're doing these tests.</v>

782
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:18.783
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

783
00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.300
<v Speaker 4>that's what we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just completed the new studies were</v>

784
00:44:22.301 --> 00:44:27.301
<v Speaker 4>two for 48 people and it showed that all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people got to very,</v>

785
00:44:28.821 --> 00:44:31.560
<v Speaker 4>very high alkaline levels in the blood,</v>

786
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:36.510
<v Speaker 2>like seven point eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's normal at seven point three?</v>

787
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 2>Seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Point four is natural.</v>

788
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:42.090
<v Speaker 2>And then you go all the way up to seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>point eight and then it comes back and</v>

789
00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:47.091
<v Speaker 2>it stays over there for all the day long</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what you want.</v>

790
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:51.690
<v Speaker 2>But most of the People Are Acidic if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>pee on it.</v>

791
00:44:51.691 --> 00:44:56.691
<v Speaker 2>And then you will see with a Ph strip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yellow to blue and green in the middle.</v>

792
00:44:56.761 --> 00:45:01.260
<v Speaker 2>And all these variations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say most of the people are just</v>

793
00:45:01.261 --> 00:45:06.261
<v Speaker 2>yellow in the morning and they do the</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing 20 minutes and they become</v>

794
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:07.800
<v Speaker 2>blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

795
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:12.490
<v Speaker 2>And that's why you want to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the neurotransmitters,</v>

796
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:17.510
<v Speaker 2>the electrical signals in the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they traveled a lot faster when it's</v>

797
00:45:17.971 --> 00:45:22.971
<v Speaker 2>alkaline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you same punch will be faster if a</v>

798
00:45:23.351 --> 00:45:25.130
<v Speaker 2>disease alkaline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when Sam Seder.</v>

799
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:29.010
<v Speaker 2>And actually it's a logical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to train with us and become</v>

800
00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:31.020
<v Speaker 2>a headache at a certain moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

801
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:35.760
<v Speaker 2>I get to my limit that I not a pointing</v>
<v Speaker 2>as fast.</v>

802
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Then when alkaline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all in the muscle and we are able</v>

803
00:45:40.561 --> 00:45:42.630
<v Speaker 2>to influence their right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

804
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:44.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

805
00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:44.963
<v Speaker 2>he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

806
00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.370
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't too much in the breathing</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

807
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:50.790
<v Speaker 2>That was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a no,</v>

808
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:53.040
<v Speaker 2>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw how you could tell,</v>

809
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:56.420
<v Speaker 2>I imagined before I was in his room and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

810
00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.360
<v Speaker 2>we did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

811
00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.100
<v Speaker 2>I tested him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

812
00:45:59.101 --> 00:46:02.130
<v Speaker 2>how is your breathing and how is your</v>
<v Speaker 2>retention?</v>

813
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:07.320
<v Speaker 2>Like what you did two and a half minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to first round you remember that means</v>

814
00:46:07.321 --> 00:46:12.060
<v Speaker 2>you store up oxygen in the body and</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore you have no need for breathing</v>

815
00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:16.710
<v Speaker 2>and you just measuring that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you think any of them had to do</v>

816
00:46:16.711 --> 00:46:19.760
<v Speaker 2>with the stress of fighting for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first time title?</v>

817
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:20.241
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

818
00:46:20.241 --> 00:46:24.600
<v Speaker 2>he was over over to to confident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

819
00:46:24.601 --> 00:46:26.760
<v Speaker 2>You think he was too confident?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too confident.</v>

820
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Why do you say that now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I saw her psych.</v>

821
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it didn't seem that way to me as a,</v>

822
00:46:31.771 --> 00:46:35.490
<v Speaker 2>as a trained observer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt he was dealing with a lot of</v>

823
00:46:35.491 --> 00:46:38.280
<v Speaker 2>anxiety because especially the way he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was fighting,</v>

824
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:40.650
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he literally was running at</v>

825
00:46:40.651 --> 00:46:42.050
<v Speaker 2>certain points and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I saw.</v>

826
00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.750
<v Speaker 2>I saw I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

827
00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.330
<v Speaker 2>I saw you there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ring.</v>

828
00:46:45.331 --> 00:46:47.430
<v Speaker 2>I was somewhere on the stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know,</v>

829
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying like when I look at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I look at the way he was performing,</v>

830
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.590
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't performing the way he</v>
<v Speaker 2>performed against junior dos Santos.</v>

831
00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

832
00:46:56.701 --> 00:46:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's because,</v>

833
00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:02.730
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I think with all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect for him.</v>

834
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:05.160
<v Speaker 2>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a good guy,</v>

835
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:10.620
<v Speaker 2>but he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mother nature knows better and I</v>

836
00:47:10.621 --> 00:47:15.621
<v Speaker 2>know mother nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I saw he needs to get back to this</v>

837
00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:20.460
<v Speaker 2>breathing back thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making it alkaline daren and keeping it</v>

838
00:47:20.461 --> 00:47:21.840
<v Speaker 2>on until the conditioning.</v>

839
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:25.230
<v Speaker 2>The old patterns go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think he got tired?</v>

840
00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.910
<v Speaker 2>What do you think happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

841
00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:29.100
<v Speaker 2>but what about him getting hit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he got.</v>

842
00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he went for a.</v>

843
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:36.220
<v Speaker 2>anything you are not able to receive</v>
<v Speaker 2>blows as,</v>

844
00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:41.340
<v Speaker 2>as good as a chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is low in Ph level is if you are</v>

845
00:47:44.201 --> 00:47:49.201
<v Speaker 2>acidic that then you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that to receive the steeper</v>

846
00:47:49.251 --> 00:47:51.730
<v Speaker 2>meal check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC heavyweight champion is 250</v>

847
00:47:51.731 --> 00:47:55.390
<v Speaker 2>pounds of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a scary dude and he hits very hard</v>

848
00:47:55.391 --> 00:47:58.390
<v Speaker 2>and he's very accurate and there's not a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole lot of people that he punches in</v>

849
00:47:58.391 --> 00:48:01.540
<v Speaker 2>the face that don't get knocked out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he was hitting allister,</v>

850
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:04.330
<v Speaker 2>I have a hard time believing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything would have saved him,</v>

851
00:48:04.331 --> 00:48:07.570
<v Speaker 2>whether it's breathing or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was getting cracked.</v>

852
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.850
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best fighters in the world.</v>

853
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

854
00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:15.100
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not into a increase in the</v>

855
00:48:15.101 --> 00:48:18.430
<v Speaker 2>performance of any sports when I do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the side,</v>

856
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:23.790
<v Speaker 2>but I want to draw to your attention for</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are suffering in the world.</v>

857
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:24.761
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>

858
00:48:24.761 --> 00:48:25.594
<v Speaker 2>But whatever I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

859
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about this moment in</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically.</v>

860
00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:33.360
<v Speaker 2>Why did you think that his lack of</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing or whatever it had an effect</v>

861
00:48:33.701 --> 00:48:35.770
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you feel like he got tired too</v>

862
00:48:35.771 --> 00:48:38.260
<v Speaker 2>quickly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you notice him diminishing his</v>

863
00:48:38.261 --> 00:48:39.370
<v Speaker 2>energy levels?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dropping?</v>

864
00:48:39.371 --> 00:48:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you seen that made you believe</v>

865
00:48:42.731 --> 00:48:45.160
<v Speaker 2>that he was not doing the breathing</v>
<v Speaker 2>practice?</v>

866
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.430
<v Speaker 2>It's not only have that day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

867
00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.300
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole process,</v>

868
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:53.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if y'all are at a top like that at</v>

869
00:48:53.861 --> 00:48:55.640
<v Speaker 2>the most of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

870
00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:58.660
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting a level to have this</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

871
00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:04.000
<v Speaker 2>then you got to work your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to condition your body and that</v>

872
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:08.560
<v Speaker 2>you do with the ride breathing exercises</v>
<v Speaker 2>along with the fighting and the air</v>

873
00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:11.060
<v Speaker 2>conditioning and the muscle training at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

874
00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:15.400
<v Speaker 2>And if it is not there that you can have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the muscles of the world,</v>

875
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:20.140
<v Speaker 2>but very soon you will be exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you work with a guy like</v>

876
00:49:20.141 --> 00:49:23.200
<v Speaker 2>alister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all due respect to him and to you,</v>

877
00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:28.990
<v Speaker 2>he's been knocked out four times in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC alone and he's been knocked out many</v>

878
00:49:28.991 --> 00:49:33.790
<v Speaker 2>times outside of the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any concern about the amount</v>

879
00:49:33.791 --> 00:49:38.050
<v Speaker 2>of damage that he's taking and do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that in any way,</v>

880
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:43.260
<v Speaker 2>this kind of training and the breathing</v>
<v Speaker 2>method could in some way help mitigate</v>

881
00:49:44.261 --> 00:49:46.300
<v Speaker 2>some of that damage he's taking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>

882
00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:47.410
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

883
00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:50.590
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say about him,</v>

884
00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.850
<v Speaker 2>he will come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will get a very good lesson though</v>

885
00:49:54.851 --> 00:49:59.020
<v Speaker 2>for my mother nature and me and Darragh</v>
<v Speaker 2>is no,</v>

886
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.500
<v Speaker 2>you cannot speculate about mother</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

887
00:50:02.501 --> 00:50:06.700
<v Speaker 2>You just got to perform the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by the 24 hours getting</v>

888
00:50:06.701 --> 00:50:11.701
<v Speaker 2>up a kid of Magento,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that beans with his weight and getting</v>

889
00:50:12.311 --> 00:50:14.020
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means breathing,</v>

890
00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:19.510
<v Speaker 2>really breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really getting into and using your mind</v>

891
00:50:19.511 --> 00:50:20.290
<v Speaker 2>and focus.</v>

892
00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Totally not thinking that you are able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it,</v>

893
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:27.040
<v Speaker 2>but doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing that does happen to fighters</v>

894
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:30.140
<v Speaker 2>and it happens inevitably in a fighter's</v>
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>

895
00:50:30.141 --> 00:50:33.200
<v Speaker 2>if they've taken a lot of fights where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were real wars,</v>

896
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.330
<v Speaker 2>is they lose their ability to take a</v>
<v Speaker 2>punch.</v>

897
00:50:35.331 --> 00:50:38.210
<v Speaker 2>It's a physiological response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The brain has to.</v>

898
00:50:38.211 --> 00:50:41.270
<v Speaker 2>The amount of punishment that you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been taking and it knows the punishments</v>

899
00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:45.260
<v Speaker 2>coming and it shuts off prematurely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shuts off much quicker than it did when</v>

900
00:50:45.261 --> 00:50:50.261
<v Speaker 2>you were younger and in the fight game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it getting Chiney or his chin</v>

901
00:50:50.391 --> 00:50:52.760
<v Speaker 2>is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know where you take a shot and you</v>

902
00:50:52.761 --> 00:50:54.710
<v Speaker 2>can see that you just can't take it</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

903
00:50:54.711 --> 00:50:59.300
<v Speaker 2>and doctors take that almost universally</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a sign.</v>

904
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.790
<v Speaker 2>They should probably start thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about hanging it up.</v>

905
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:03.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

906
00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:05.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see that at all in him and you.</v>

907
00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Are you concerned about that at all?</v>

908
00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:14.200
<v Speaker 2>I will say that did a January.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'll see it once you make it a,</v>

909
00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:16.190
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have anything to do with</v>

910
00:51:16.191 --> 00:51:19.760
<v Speaker 2>physical condition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has more to do with punishment.</v>

911
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Has More to do with getting hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so much into fighting and oldest</v>

912
00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:31.880
<v Speaker 2>toll information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just know how nature works and I will</v>

913
00:51:31.881 --> 00:51:33.590
<v Speaker 2>test them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will see it.</v>

914
00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:38.620
<v Speaker 2>I will observe and get my objective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will try to help him and I get my</v>

915
00:51:39.891 --> 00:51:41.490
<v Speaker 2>objective opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

916
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.360
<v Speaker 2>they're in and that's what I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

917
00:51:44.361 --> 00:51:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

918
00:51:46.011 --> 00:51:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Aalto a high performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

919
00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:51.840
<v Speaker 2>extreme athlete as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up on the mountain,</v>

920
00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:56.600
<v Speaker 2>but also people with conditions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually even more interesting.</v>

921
00:51:56.630 --> 00:52:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Like what kinds of conditions like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crohn's disease and Roma to weed to</v>

922
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.400
<v Speaker 2>thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This asthma and they will make it in 24</v>

923
00:52:04.401 --> 00:52:07.490
<v Speaker 2>hours as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because of this breathing.</v>

924
00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.760
<v Speaker 2>People with rheumatoid arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take them up.</v>

925
00:52:10.761 --> 00:52:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Mount Kilimanjaro already did I already</v>
<v Speaker 2>did?</v>

926
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they do oldest program all the time</v>

927
00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:20.690
<v Speaker 2>and they have zero flammatory markers</v>
<v Speaker 2>left in the body.</v>

928
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:24.560
<v Speaker 2>So they controlled a or a condition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritis,</v>

929
00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:28.870
<v Speaker 2>crones disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take immune diseases complete.</v>

930
00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:32.840
<v Speaker 2>And how severe is their arthritis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because people that are like really</v>

931
00:52:32.841 --> 00:52:37.340
<v Speaker 2>crippled and they can't walk very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've done that with them and with</v>

932
00:52:37.341 --> 00:52:41.210
<v Speaker 2>papers it up to a certain level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you can't walk anymore,</v>

933
00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you of Magento.</v>

934
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you can barely walk or what?</v>

935
00:52:46.881 --> 00:52:49.570
<v Speaker 2>If you can walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll walk slow or what if you walk when</v>

936
00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:50.730
<v Speaker 2>you walk in pain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

937
00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:53.510
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm into scientific research because I</v>

938
00:52:53.511 --> 00:52:58.511
<v Speaker 2>want to help humanity direct and I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we are able to tap into the systems</v>

939
00:52:59.571 --> 00:53:04.571
<v Speaker 2>and begin to heal first before we go</v>
<v Speaker 2>into say feats like that.</v>

940
00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:09.500
<v Speaker 2>So you work with these people that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritis or Crohn's disease right now</v>

941
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.740
<v Speaker 2>to strengthen their immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific research or their</v>

942
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.650
<v Speaker 2>inflammation first year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how much time do you spend with them</v>

943
00:53:15.651 --> 00:53:18.650
<v Speaker 2>before you take them to something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme environment?</v>

944
00:53:18.651 --> 00:53:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Like Kilimanjaro I got now my</v>
<v Speaker 2>instructors ever.</v>

945
00:53:22.561 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 2>We were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first I teach them in</v>

946
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:27.540
<v Speaker 4>a session.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many instructors?</v>

947
00:53:27.541 --> 00:53:29.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now what,</v>

948
00:53:29.071 --> 00:53:31.230
<v Speaker 4>how many is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A $200.</v>

949
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:32.730
<v Speaker 4>200.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

950
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:34.230
<v Speaker 4>All over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

951
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mostly in the Netherlands now.</v>

952
00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:40.530
<v Speaker 4>But now America is beginning to do the</v>
<v Speaker 4>basic course,</v>

953
00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:44.940
<v Speaker 4>an advanced module.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we have the instructors wick</v>

954
00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.410
<v Speaker 4>and it goes up to a bachelor level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eh?</v>

955
00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:52.560
<v Speaker 4>The books are in the university.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's real late at all and scientifically</v>

956
00:53:52.561 --> 00:53:54.360
<v Speaker 4>endorsed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there it is.</v>

957
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:58.680
<v Speaker 4>It works and it works with us for those</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

958
00:53:58.681 --> 00:54:01.680
<v Speaker 4>And we still got to find out tomorrow</v>
<v Speaker 4>par example,</v>

959
00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:03.060
<v Speaker 4>I got a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

960
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:04.880
<v Speaker 4>scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

961
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:10.580
<v Speaker 4>sort of lecture together with Professor</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huberman from Stanford University in</v>

962
00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:15.510
<v Speaker 4>front of Ideo and Ideo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There comes a guy who is the google</v>

963
00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:18.500
<v Speaker 4>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hat of the doll,</v>

964
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:23.790
<v Speaker 4>and he was the former man in charge of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the health care in America.</v>

965
00:54:23.791 --> 00:54:28.500
<v Speaker 4>In us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean big people and it's not for</v>

966
00:54:28.501 --> 00:54:29.334
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

967
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:33.360
<v Speaker 4>They see it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work only for say people with</v>

968
00:54:33.361 --> 00:54:37.220
<v Speaker 4>arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also with depression is how much</v>

969
00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.390
<v Speaker 4>people feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

970
00:54:39.391 --> 00:54:40.470
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

971
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.660
<v Speaker 4>Preventative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

972
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:45.600
<v Speaker 4>increasing quality of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes sir.</v>

973
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:48.540
<v Speaker 4>Yes sir,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that is only because of a simple</v>

974
00:54:48.541 --> 00:54:52.620
<v Speaker 4>principle out of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go back to mother nature inside,</v>

975
00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:56.900
<v Speaker 4>go back into the depth of your own</v>
<v Speaker 4>physiology and know that it is dire.</v>

976
00:54:56.910 --> 00:55:01.110
<v Speaker 4>You are able to awaken that and get it</v>
<v Speaker 4>into your control,</v>

977
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:06.300
<v Speaker 4>preventing you from disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from depression or becoming happy,</v>

978
00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:09.600
<v Speaker 4>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so essentially it's in some ways tapping</v>

979
00:55:09.601 --> 00:55:13.350
<v Speaker 4>into the same force that creates the</v>
<v Speaker 4>placebo effect because there is an</v>

980
00:55:13.351 --> 00:55:16.920
<v Speaker 4>effect when your mind thinks that it has</v>
<v Speaker 4>a drug that's going to heal it,</v>

981
00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:20.340
<v Speaker 4>even if it's a sugar pill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see a visible improvement on many</v>

982
00:55:20.341 --> 00:55:25.290
<v Speaker 4>people because of that belief,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your belief system plus the oxygen plus</v>

983
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:28.860
<v Speaker 4>the deep breathing exercise and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>increasing blood flow to the brain.</v>

984
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:32.440
<v Speaker 4>It has all these positive and then at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Colt trains,</v>

985
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.600
<v Speaker 4>gradual cold exposure trains their</v>
<v Speaker 4>transportation system.</v>

986
00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:41.900
<v Speaker 4>Seventy 5,000 miles of capillaries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>arteries and veins within us.</v>

987
00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:47.480
<v Speaker 4>They transport oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are in a primitive muscles and</v>

988
00:55:47.851 --> 00:55:52.350
<v Speaker 4>reflexes and when they are stimulated by</v>
<v Speaker 4>cold showers,</v>

989
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:57.270
<v Speaker 4>just cold showers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the heart rate is going down and</v>

990
00:55:57.290 --> 00:56:02.290
<v Speaker 4>the transportation of oxygen suddenly is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot better and it gets to the immune</v>

991
00:56:02.911 --> 00:56:04.230
<v Speaker 4>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Logically.</v>

992
00:56:04.231 --> 00:56:06.030
<v Speaker 4>The immune cells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are more alert,</v>

993
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:11.390
<v Speaker 4>better fat at a date.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They recognize intruders who should not</v>

994
00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:14.900
<v Speaker 4>be there and they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They killed up there.</v>

995
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:19.950
<v Speaker 4>It's like cell death and they put a</v>
<v Speaker 4>specific hormone molecule on the cell</v>

996
00:56:20.701 --> 00:56:24.820
<v Speaker 4>membrane and it's gone now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long has it been since the first</v>

997
00:56:24.821 --> 00:56:25.481
<v Speaker 4>podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did.</v>

998
00:56:25.481 --> 00:56:29.110
<v Speaker 4>Was it two years?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A year and a half or something like</v>

999
00:56:29.111 --> 00:56:31.660
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A year and a half.</v>

1000
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:35.560
<v Speaker 4>Jamie will tell us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>October 2015.</v>

1001
00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:36.261
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>recently.</v>

1002
00:56:36.261 --> 00:56:38.140
<v Speaker 4>First.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically year.</v>

1003
00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:39.220
<v Speaker 4>One year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

1004
00:56:39.221 --> 00:56:39.911
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1005
00:56:39.911 --> 00:56:40.690
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:43.150
<v Speaker 4>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What has happened in a year?</v>

1007
00:56:43.151 --> 00:56:48.151
<v Speaker 4>What new breakthroughs or what new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what new evidence and have in that year.</v>

1008
00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:54.600
<v Speaker 4>The evidence is that people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning to grasp the gravity of what I</v>

1009
00:56:54.941 --> 00:56:58.790
<v Speaker 4>found because two and a half years ago</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1010
00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.810
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had this publish it in one of the</v>

1011
00:57:01.811 --> 00:57:06.811
<v Speaker 4>best papers of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the past papers to what proceedings of</v>

1012
00:57:07.001 --> 00:57:11.070
<v Speaker 4>National Academy of scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is highly repetitious,</v>

1013
00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:16.110
<v Speaker 4>reputed to scientific or a magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like nature and United States and</v>

1014
00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:20.920
<v Speaker 4>if you come and get into there then it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>really solid,</v>

1015
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:26.670
<v Speaker 4>so they took it up into the books,</v>
<v Speaker 4>designed at a university books full</v>

1016
00:57:27.731 --> 00:57:31.750
<v Speaker 4>chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's not for nothing and that's</v>

1017
00:57:31.751 --> 00:57:36.640
<v Speaker 4>what the new information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the new physicians and biologists need</v>

1018
00:57:36.641 --> 00:57:41.641
<v Speaker 4>to digest as being signs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it is science and it's two and a half</v>

1019
00:57:41.651 --> 00:57:46.580
<v Speaker 4>years ago that we approved the autonomic</v>
<v Speaker 4>nervous system up till death.</v>

1020
00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:51.600
<v Speaker 4>Never been proven in scientific history</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be influenced by humans now,</v>

1021
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:58.030
<v Speaker 4>not little bit to be influenced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Being able to be influenced big time</v>

1022
00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:01.910
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enabling it within a quarter of our way</v>

1023
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:07.140
<v Speaker 4>to tap into the specific immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which normally takes five to seven days.</v>

1024
00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:10.690
<v Speaker 4>So that's a big finding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

1025
00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.900
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now the world is going to turn the other</v>

1026
00:58:13.901 --> 00:58:16.000
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now people are going to see.</v>

1027
00:58:16.001 --> 00:58:20.710
<v Speaker 4>We are able to do so much more with what</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got already.</v>

1028
00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:25.060
<v Speaker 4>They are going to receive 10 Nobel</v>
<v Speaker 4>prizes,</v>

1029
00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that because it is</v>

1030
00:58:28.001 --> 00:58:29.380
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1031
00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:31.400
<v Speaker 4>But Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes time.</v>

1032
00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:36.250
<v Speaker 4>It takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So since last year I see more and more</v>

1033
00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:40.120
<v Speaker 4>and more people getting to this and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's nice,</v>

1034
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:45.210
<v Speaker 4>but I want scientific validation more</v>
<v Speaker 4>because apparently they do not really</v>

1035
00:58:46.871 --> 00:58:51.871
<v Speaker 4>grasp within the scientific community</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gravity of what we found.</v>

1036
00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.860
<v Speaker 4>It's historical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not mine itself,</v>

1037
00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:59.980
<v Speaker 4>Mother Nature for don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes time for people and their</v>

1038
00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:03.280
<v Speaker 4>opinions to shift when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 4>things along these lines.</v>

1039
00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:08.370
<v Speaker 4>Apparently that's the psychology of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people and I'm finding this out.</v>

1040
00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:10.990
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got in the beginning,</v>

1041
00:59:10.991 --> 00:59:14.500
<v Speaker 4>very frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I begin to understand this is the</v>

1042
00:59:14.501 --> 00:59:18.700
<v Speaker 4>way it all comes top down and it takes</v>
<v Speaker 4>some time.</v>

1043
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 4>When Galileo found out that we are not</v>
<v Speaker 4>the center of</v>

1044
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.310
<v Speaker 2>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is the sun and we are turning</v>

1045
00:59:25.311 --> 00:59:30.311
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was almost banned from the church and</v>

1046
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:35.680
<v Speaker 2>almost sentenced to death as a heretic</v>
<v Speaker 2>or things like that,</v>

1047
00:59:35.991 --> 00:59:39.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was just as truthful a new way of</v>

1048
00:59:39.561 --> 00:59:40.700
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1049
00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Well apparently not experiencing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of resistance.</v>

1050
00:59:43.881 --> 00:59:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you were experiencing not really</v>

1051
00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.550
<v Speaker 2>seen universally praised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1052
00:59:49.551 --> 00:59:49.921
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1053
00:59:49.921 --> 00:59:54.560
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of acceptance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning people actually practicing it.</v>

1054
00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:57.650
<v Speaker 2>That's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the consequences,</v>

1055
00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:02.680
<v Speaker 2>the positive consequences of practicing</v>
<v Speaker 2>this are enormous for every person into</v>

1056
01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.230
<v Speaker 2>and very accessible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very effective,</v>

1057
01:00:06.231 --> 01:00:09.480
<v Speaker 2>very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use your method before I go on stage a</v>

1058
01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:10.760
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1059
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.080
<v Speaker 2>I started doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started doing it after our podcast</v>

1060
01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:15.260
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take these big giant deep breaths.</v>

1061
01:00:15.261 --> 01:00:17.720
<v Speaker 2>I let some out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big giant deep breaths and I let them</v>

1062
01:00:17.721 --> 01:00:20.900
<v Speaker 2>out and I do it for several minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>before my shows and I feel like I'm</v>

1063
01:00:20.901 --> 01:00:24.020
<v Speaker 2>high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm just filled with everything.</v>

1064
01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.420
<v Speaker 2>Like woo would just feel crazy pumped</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1065
01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

1066
01:00:27.561 --> 01:00:30.950
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that enabled you to get a direct</v>

1067
01:00:30.951 --> 01:00:34.130
<v Speaker 2>access,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better access to your adrenaline?</v>

1068
01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hormonal system and gives me,</v>

1069
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:40.970
<v Speaker 2>it mean that breeding in like that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives me energy,</v>

1070
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.310
<v Speaker 2>it gives me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it elevates me,</v>

1071
01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.530
<v Speaker 2>it feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feel like it elevates my energy</v>

1072
01:00:45.531 --> 01:00:47.210
<v Speaker 2>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for taking it on.</v>

1073
01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for having me last year this</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1074
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:54.770
<v Speaker 2>And I'm into ongoing research right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>with German,</v>

1075
01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:58.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening and how we got to.</v>

1076
01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:03.900
<v Speaker 2>We found out first time in scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>history now and not me,</v>

1077
01:01:03.901 --> 01:01:06.880
<v Speaker 2>the university doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1078
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:09.230
<v Speaker 2>doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1079
01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:14.140
<v Speaker 2>say to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was worried that it got on the</v>

1080
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:15.050
<v Speaker 2>machinery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1081
01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:15.903
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1082
01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:20.690
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for the first time in scientific</v>

1083
01:01:20.691 --> 01:01:24.050
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they found out that hundred percent</v>

1084
01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:29.080
<v Speaker 2>saturation or oxygen in the blood is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>really 100 percent right.</v>

1085
01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:34.040
<v Speaker 2>But what I don't understand that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>no nothing more than 100 percent.</v>

1086
01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did they just not understand shit?</v>

1087
01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.410
<v Speaker 2>So they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a level that they thought was</v>

1088
01:01:39.411 --> 01:01:41.210
<v Speaker 2>100 percent and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1089
01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.560
<v Speaker 2>nobody has ever reached a higher level</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this.</v>

1090
01:01:43.561 --> 01:01:45.800
<v Speaker 2>So this must be what 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>saturation looks like.</v>

1091
01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that you got more than 100</v>

1092
01:01:48.741 --> 01:01:52.970
<v Speaker 2>percent saturation as you achieved</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher levels of saturation than they</v>

1093
01:01:52.971 --> 01:01:54.770
<v Speaker 2>thought possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a better way of describing?</v>

1094
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did it with a laser on the on</v>

1095
01:01:59.561 --> 01:02:04.561
<v Speaker 2>the chest and that you are able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>measure the mitochondrial oxygen</v>

1096
01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:10.370
<v Speaker 2>tension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mitochondria electrical factor,</v>

1097
01:02:10.371 --> 01:02:14.630
<v Speaker 2>a little factories in the cell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the engines of the sale of the south,</v>

1098
01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:19.660
<v Speaker 2>they are able to receive more oxygen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's</v>

1099
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.490
<v Speaker 4>very interesting and that's a great</v>
<v Speaker 4>finding.</v>

1100
01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean more than a hundred percent first</v>
<v Speaker 4>time in days three.</v>

1101
01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:31.850
<v Speaker 4>That's a great finding I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it shows that we are able to have</v>

1102
01:02:32.491 --> 01:02:36.840
<v Speaker 4>more oxygen inside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suddenly we are able to get into the</v>

1103
01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:41.820
<v Speaker 4>cell influence energy and energy</v>
<v Speaker 4>production,</v>

1104
01:02:41.821 --> 01:02:46.821
<v Speaker 4>the ATP that those are molecules and if</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is an aerobic then it's like two</v>

1105
01:02:49.411 --> 01:02:54.411
<v Speaker 4>molecules are able to produce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it becomes Arabic,</v>

1106
01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:59.430
<v Speaker 4>then it's up to 38 molecules that can</v>
<v Speaker 4>produce,</v>

1107
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:03.600
<v Speaker 4>that is energy and we are able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>produce more oxygen.</v>

1108
01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:08.160
<v Speaker 4>What happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens with a cell that is</v>

1109
01:03:08.161 --> 01:03:13.161
<v Speaker 4>deprived for 48 hours of 35 percent less</v>
<v Speaker 4>oxygen?</v>

1110
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:18.360
<v Speaker 4>It becomes cancerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Real.</v>

1111
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.330
<v Speaker 4>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as simple as that,</v>

1112
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.520
<v Speaker 4>have you ever worked with cancer</v>
<v Speaker 4>patients?</v>

1113
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:27.390
<v Speaker 4>I want to now with the universities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's very,</v>

1114
01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:32.160
<v Speaker 4>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Complicated matter and everybody thinks</v>

1115
01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.320
<v Speaker 4>it's not able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1116
01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:39.540
<v Speaker 4>be</v>
<v Speaker 4>questioned or a research imperative to</v>

1117
01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.510
<v Speaker 4>these people get medication because</v>
<v Speaker 4>their lives on the line.</v>

1118
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:47.100
<v Speaker 4>They could die thousand dollar a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are good clients.</v>

1119
01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.850
<v Speaker 4>What's 200,000?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1120
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:51.640
<v Speaker 4>the cancer patients.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

1121
01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:54.240
<v Speaker 4>you think that there's an issue where</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to lose that money?</v>

1122
01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:56.100
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think?</v>

1123
01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:56.821
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

1124
01:03:56.821 --> 01:04:00.540
<v Speaker 4>but don't you think there's some</v>
<v Speaker 4>patients out there are some who have</v>

1125
01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:03.070
<v Speaker 4>autonomous control of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got one.</v>

1126
01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:06.630
<v Speaker 4>I got one guy who just gave me a book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big Book.</v>

1127
01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:11.760
<v Speaker 4>What is his name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just gave the book to a professor and</v>

1128
01:04:11.761 --> 01:04:16.761
<v Speaker 4>he cured from terminal cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met him in 2007.</v>

1129
01:04:17.401 --> 01:04:20.100
<v Speaker 4>He had stage four cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of cancer?</v>

1130
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.260
<v Speaker 4>Skin cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which deteriorate all the,</v>

1131
01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.100
<v Speaker 4>all the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you're gone.</v>

1132
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:31.020
<v Speaker 4>You're not able to function and silver</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he wasn't stage four,</v>

1133
01:04:31.021 --> 01:04:36.021
<v Speaker 4>so almost a terminal and I met him in</v>
<v Speaker 4>2007 then and I told them,</v>

1134
01:04:38.611 --> 01:04:43.611
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the science is telling you that is</v>

1135
01:04:44.241 --> 01:04:47.040
<v Speaker 4>not really what really is.</v>

1136
01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.580
<v Speaker 4>It is only what has been found up to</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1137
01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.210
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or I found that the autonomic nervous</v>

1138
01:04:54.211 --> 01:04:55.470
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1139
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:58.800
<v Speaker 4>can be influenced the endocrine system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the immune system.</v>

1140
01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:03.120
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what else and what more don't yield,</v>

1141
01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:07.260
<v Speaker 4>don't yield,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get on and positive thinking they're in</v>

1142
01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:10.080
<v Speaker 4>a positive charges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what,</v>

1143
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:13.980
<v Speaker 4>but breathing and now it appears to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>that 48</v>

1144
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:20.510
<v Speaker 4>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>35 percent less of oxygen NSL becomes a,</v>

1145
01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:25.570
<v Speaker 4>makes a cell cancers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what I told you just now that the</v>

1146
01:05:25.571 --> 01:05:28.990
<v Speaker 4>molecules we can influence that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1147
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.860
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the engines of the cell and make much</v>

1148
01:05:32.861 --> 01:05:34.420
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1149
01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:39.070
<v Speaker 4>much more molecules by implementing but</v>
<v Speaker 4>jet by breathing.</v>

1150
01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:41.320
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do reading unbelieving.</v>

1151
01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:45.580
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that it would benefit</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are already under cancer</v>

1152
01:05:45.581 --> 01:05:48.700
<v Speaker 4>treatment?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if they're already in therapy or</v>

1153
01:05:48.701 --> 01:05:50.520
<v Speaker 4>radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1154
01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:53.950
<v Speaker 4>the chemo actually works better if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>do the breathing techniques.</v>

1155
01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:57.370
<v Speaker 4>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It goes more specifically into that</v>

1156
01:05:57.371 --> 01:05:58.204
<v Speaker 4>area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

1157
01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:01.180
<v Speaker 4>And Chemo is essentially poison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1158
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:02.560
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

1159
01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:05.890
<v Speaker 4>And what I wear if I'm gonna drink here</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

1160
01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:08.920
<v Speaker 4>another little bit or it what would not</v>
<v Speaker 4>be bad.</v>

1161
01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:12.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My son is saying,</v>

1162
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:13.151
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1163
01:06:13.151 --> 01:06:16.670
<v Speaker 4>don't do it in</v>
<v Speaker 4>listening.</v>

1164
01:06:16.770 --> 01:06:17.990
<v Speaker 4>I got some control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1165
01:06:17.991 --> 01:06:19.730
<v Speaker 4>I made him tell him to fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1166
01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:24.740
<v Speaker 4>If it could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chairs sometimes.</v>

1167
01:06:24.970 --> 01:06:28.030
<v Speaker 4>Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The story goes like this with my son.</v>

1168
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:32.760
<v Speaker 4>I was in Africa and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the Kilimanjaro.</v>

1169
01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:38.220
<v Speaker 4>Then after I did a successful attempt in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a $28 and the insurance and everything</v>

1170
01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:44.500
<v Speaker 4>got to tell something about Scott County</v>
<v Speaker 4>to an investigative journalist who came</v>

1171
01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:49.501
<v Speaker 4>to get me a disguised as a guru and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>with lies and everything he disguised.</v>

1172
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:56.350
<v Speaker 4>I know he wanted to do you say an</v>
<v Speaker 4>investigative journalist and</v>

1173
01:06:56.351 --> 01:07:01.030
<v Speaker 4>anthropologist and he came to Poland to</v>
<v Speaker 4>see who I am for real.</v>

1174
01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:04.280
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is into finding out how to uh,</v>

1175
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:09.390
<v Speaker 4>the organ trafficking goes and these</v>
<v Speaker 4>gurus who will make people do things.</v>

1176
01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.440
<v Speaker 4>He thought you were one of those?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1177
01:07:11.441 --> 01:07:11.880
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1178
01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:15.580
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he was paid to do,</v>

1179
01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.860
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get to me and investigate him,</v>

1180
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:24.990
<v Speaker 4>but his attitude is the guy who was</v>
<v Speaker 4>publishing his books and he made a new</v>

1181
01:07:27.641 --> 01:07:32.330
<v Speaker 4>book her lately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he came to Poland and uh,</v>

1182
01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:34.540
<v Speaker 4>two days later he was doing the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

1183
01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:38.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing that so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't end up on the outside though.</v>

1184
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:43.450
<v Speaker 4>We'll do see someone like you that makes</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these crazy claims and you know,</v>

1185
01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.430
<v Speaker 4>talks about love and breathing and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1186
01:07:45.431 --> 01:07:48.790
<v Speaker 4>this guy's all about trying to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's wives and make a lot of</v>

1187
01:07:48.791 --> 01:07:49.391
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1188
01:07:49.391 --> 01:07:49.780
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1189
01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.060
<v Speaker 4>Just I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1190
01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:52.990
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>

1191
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.650
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1192
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:55.450
<v Speaker 4>I know you were legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you are,</v>

1193
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:58.990
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of people like you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand why he would touch a lot of</v>

1194
01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:02.890
<v Speaker 4>people who make these grand claims turn</v>
<v Speaker 4>out to be,</v>

1195
01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:03.701
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1196
01:08:03.701 --> 01:08:05.710
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that can claim</v>
<v Speaker 4>miracle claims.</v>

1197
01:08:05.711 --> 01:08:06.730
<v Speaker 4>They usually crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1198
01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:07.630
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

1199
01:08:07.631 --> 01:08:10.420
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I went with this investigative</v>

1200
01:08:10.421 --> 01:08:15.421
<v Speaker 4>journalist and he became a fool adept.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And did he give up the ghost?</v>

1201
01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:17.600
<v Speaker 4>Did he tell you what he's doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He totally,</v>

1202
01:08:17.601 --> 01:08:22.601
<v Speaker 4>totally took two days to disappear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his distance and all,</v>

1203
01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:27.050
<v Speaker 4>and then he was also in his shorts on</v>
<v Speaker 4>bare barefoot in the snow.</v>

1204
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:32.200
<v Speaker 4>Is that what are you doing there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just move it.</v>

1205
01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:35.530
<v Speaker 4>I can teach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can teach them.</v>

1206
01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:38.840
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you can teach me to teach me.</v>

1207
01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:42.260
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I think you can teach me some</v>
<v Speaker 4>techniques,</v>

1208
01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:47.510
<v Speaker 4>but I can teach you for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Altos some techniques like standing for</v>

1209
01:08:47.511 --> 01:08:50.420
<v Speaker 4>two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>barefoot in the snow,</v>

1210
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:53.360
<v Speaker 4>in your shorts and in the horse stance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1211
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:55.580
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to teach me that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1212
01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:56.660
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not doing that.</v>

1213
01:08:57.190 --> 01:08:59.300
<v Speaker 4>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe it can be done.</v>

1214
01:08:59.450 --> 01:08:59.871
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1215
01:08:59.871 --> 01:09:02.780
<v Speaker 4>if I had to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I feel like I could do it if</v>

1216
01:09:02.781 --> 01:09:03.830
<v Speaker 4>I had to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1217
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:05.900
<v Speaker 4>Would I do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm busy.</v>

1218
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:06.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1219
01:09:06.951 --> 01:09:11.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were for two days your underwear wax on,</v>

1220
01:09:13.071 --> 01:09:15.410
<v Speaker 4>wax off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>laughing,</v>

1221
01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:19.250
<v Speaker 4>stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But many people do this and they</v>

1222
01:09:19.251 --> 01:09:23.630
<v Speaker 4>suddenly see that they are capable of</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing so much more because they begin to</v>

1223
01:09:23.631 --> 01:09:28.631
<v Speaker 4>learn to control the acidity that what</v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes acidic in their bodies.</v>

1224
01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:32.120
<v Speaker 4>So the performance and for that I do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1225
01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:37.780
<v Speaker 4>So he did it and together with me last</v>
<v Speaker 4>January it was also on the Kilimanjaro.</v>

1226
01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.220
<v Speaker 4>You stay friends?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1227
01:09:40.221 --> 01:09:44.450
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wrote a book that what doesn't kill</v>

1228
01:09:44.451 --> 01:09:47.510
<v Speaker 4>you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says it will come out next month or</v>

1229
01:09:47.511 --> 01:09:48.830
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it is about you.</v>

1230
01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:52.250
<v Speaker 4>It's mostly about what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The method?</v>

1231
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:53.383
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1232
01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.760
<v Speaker 4>And that I worked at [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>

1233
01:09:55.790 --> 01:10:00.110
<v Speaker 4>he's a scientist and he is an</v>
<v Speaker 4>anthropologist but he is always trying</v>

1234
01:10:00.111 --> 01:10:05.111
<v Speaker 4>out the stuff he's writing about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we got into this and there's a very</v>

1235
01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:07.000
<v Speaker 4>nice book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you shoot.</v>

1236
01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.590
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a teaser on is very nice,</v>

1237
01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:13.160
<v Speaker 4>but I'd love to have them on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1238

<v Speaker 4>Let me know like when the book's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to come out.</v>

1241
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:21.150
<v Speaker 4>Yes and no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll try it.</v>

1242
01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.600
<v Speaker 4>There is a teaser and you see it all.</v>

1243
01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.550
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very,</v>

1244
01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's beautiful and it's very good for a</v>

1245
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:34.270
<v Speaker 4>human for anybody to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he lost weight very fast and it</v>

1246
01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:41.960
<v Speaker 4>could do now are 80 pushups without</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathing.</v>

1247
01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:44.900
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] 80 pushups without</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathing.</v>

1248
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:46.850
<v Speaker 4>He was an intellectual list.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1249
01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.930
<v Speaker 4>He can hold his breath and do 80</v>
<v Speaker 4>pushups.</v>

1250
01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:51.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I find that very hard to believe with</v>

1251
01:10:51.651 --> 01:10:53.480
<v Speaker 4>no air in the lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>

1252
01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:54.210
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1253
01:10:54.210 --> 01:10:56.080
<v Speaker 4>No air in the lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1254
01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.430
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

1255
01:10:58.730 --> 01:11:03.050
<v Speaker 4>He goes down nowhere in the long blows</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the air and then there's eight</v>

1256
01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:04.820
<v Speaker 4>zero pushups in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes sir.</v>

1257
01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.270
<v Speaker 4>I call bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1258
01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:09.980
<v Speaker 4>And I do it the ultimate it was this guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>look like,</v>

1259
01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:11.470
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1260
01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:15.780
<v Speaker 4>maybe as wide as the fucking savage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to be able to do 80 pushups,</v>

1261
01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:17.790
<v Speaker 4>periods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>control of oxygen.</v>

1262
01:11:17.791 --> 01:11:20.790
<v Speaker 4>You can do one pushup because you are</v>
<v Speaker 4>alkaline,</v>

1263
01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:24.450
<v Speaker 4>but if you are able to maintain the</v>
<v Speaker 4>alkalinity in the buddy,</v>

1264
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.550
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there you go.</v>

1265
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.280
<v Speaker 4>Is there a video?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy doing 80 push pushups with no</v>

1266
01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:32.280
<v Speaker 4>oxygen in his lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe him.</v>

1267
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:36.690
<v Speaker 4>I saw him do math at least 50 in my</v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

1268
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:39.930
<v Speaker 4>but he went off and I see too many</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1269
01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:45.410
<v Speaker 4>but I see older people with roof with</v>
<v Speaker 4>arthritis who cannot do any push up and</v>

1270
01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:51.740
<v Speaker 4>I make them do 40 pushups in in one day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1271
01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.340
<v Speaker 4>Because we controlled the flammatory</v>
<v Speaker 4>markers in the blood,</v>

1272
01:11:56.490 --> 01:12:00.060
<v Speaker 4>suppressing them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and suddenly they are able and with the</v>

1273
01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:02.400
<v Speaker 4>extra oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making it alkaline.</v>

1274
01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:08.240
<v Speaker 4>The muscle tissue keeps on throwing</v>
<v Speaker 4>these as a teal holiness the neuro</v>

1275
01:12:08.561 --> 01:12:13.230
<v Speaker 4>transmitter performance and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>surprised themselves,</v>

1276
01:12:13.231 --> 01:12:17.100
<v Speaker 4>astonished themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that just seems like a lot of</v>

1277
01:12:17.101 --> 01:12:20.010
<v Speaker 4>pushups do with no air in your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it say here?</v>

1278
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:24.330
<v Speaker 4>I can do 80 pushups on a single breath</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I lost seven pounds of belly fat and</v>

1279
01:12:24.331 --> 01:12:25.810
<v Speaker 4>70 days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker there.</v>

1280
01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:29.490
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not an athlete.</v>

1281
01:12:29.491 --> 01:12:30.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm not exceptional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen Bitch,</v>

1282
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:32.580
<v Speaker 4>if you could do 80 pushups in a single</v>
<v Speaker 4>breath,</v>

1283
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.190
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking exceptional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to know what he's calling a</v>

1284
01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.350
<v Speaker 4>pushup if he's one of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfuckers.</v>

1285
01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:38.520
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1286
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.140
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no doubt.</v>

1287
01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:40.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let.</v>

1288
01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:41.053
<v Speaker 4>Let.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let him.</v>

1289
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:43.470
<v Speaker 4>I want to see this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to see you</v>

1290
01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:47.970
<v Speaker 5>then</v>

1291
01:12:47.970 --> 01:12:49.360
<v Speaker 4>I call bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1292
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:51.810
<v Speaker 4>touch your chin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chin,</v>

1293
01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.360
<v Speaker 4>go back up all the way up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lock it out.</v>

1294
01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:58.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it takes about at least two minutes</v>

1295
01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.280
<v Speaker 4>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you asked him to,</v>

1296
01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:02.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to uh,</v>

1297
01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:05.230
<v Speaker 4>while you're exercising at least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1298
01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:07.290
<v Speaker 4>I think I couldn't do one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't do that.</v>

1299
01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.560
<v Speaker 4>You can do that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do 80 pushups on a single breath.</v>

1300
01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:13.050
<v Speaker 4>You would know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think so?</v>

1301
01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:15.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's try it.</v>

1302
01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:19.560
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you try it and you to me too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I can't do it.</v>

1303
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:22.080
<v Speaker 4>I can't do 80 pushups on a single</v>
<v Speaker 4>breath.</v>

1304
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:23.250
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do it.</v>

1305
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:26.670
<v Speaker 4>So wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were we don't need to prove this now</v>

1306
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:28.800
<v Speaker 4>while this thing is time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now's a good time.</v>

1307
01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:32.040
<v Speaker 4>But we will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we will wait.</v>

1308
01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:33.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another thing,</v>

1309
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.900
<v Speaker 4>actually I wanted to come back because</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do it.</v>

1310
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:40.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling a story about my son.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1311
01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:44.310
<v Speaker 4>that's the old original step.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the guy was trying to investigate</v>

1312
01:13:44.311 --> 01:13:47.490
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thought you were a fake gurus and we</v>

1313
01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:51.030
<v Speaker 4>did in 28 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they kill him with our lives to January</v>

1314
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:53.100
<v Speaker 4>insured.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he did it too,</v>

1315
01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:56.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a very nice and all done,</v>

1316
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:59.220
<v Speaker 4>but then later when we did it</v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplish,</v>

1317
01:13:59.221 --> 01:14:04.221
<v Speaker 4>I mean the biggest feat was the 76 year</v>
<v Speaker 4>old man doing the kingdom on channel 44</v>

1318
01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:08.550
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's A.</v>

1319
01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:10.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's unheard off.</v>

1320
01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 4>And he did it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

1321
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.100
<v Speaker 2>with them we are 26 other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

1322
01:14:15.101 --> 01:14:16.390
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old young.</v>

1323
01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.313
<v Speaker 2>We did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will,</v>

1324
01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:23.360
<v Speaker 2>how it's taken them 44 hours to do this</v>
<v Speaker 2>climb and timing to the top and.</v>

1325
01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean like how many miles is it?</v>

1326
01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:31.450
<v Speaker 2>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven miles in 40.</v>

1327
01:14:31.451 --> 01:14:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Four hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of gold.</v>

1328
01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Went up hiking and extreme altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1329
01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you Google?</v>

1330
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:42.010
<v Speaker 2>What's the world record pushups for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>single breath?</v>

1331
01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Turns out 60.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1332
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:48.010
<v Speaker 2>if it is exactly that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got the new world record coming up.</v>

1333
01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:54.850
<v Speaker 2>So you were saying your son?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1334
01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So afterwards,</v>

1335
01:14:56.381 --> 01:15:01.381
<v Speaker 2>when we did it and accomplish it to last</v>
<v Speaker 2>January I went to is through to these</v>

1336
01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:04.780
<v Speaker 2>natural reserves and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1337
01:15:04.781 --> 01:15:09.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got the Serengeti Russia a no go on.</v>

1338
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Goto a crater with the lions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1339
01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I do things with the Messiah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He as well.</v>

1340
01:15:15.190 --> 01:15:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask you this?</v>

1341
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.160
<v Speaker 2>Did you take malaria medication when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>went there?</v>

1342
01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.020
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1343
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Will you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were you there when the mosquitoes were</v>

1344
01:15:21.281 --> 01:15:23.440
<v Speaker 2>around show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always around.</v>

1345
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.470
<v Speaker 2>He didn't worry about malaria?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1346
01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:30.500
<v Speaker 2>They cause inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think I'm able to deal with that,</v>

1347
01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:34.120
<v Speaker 2>so I take a little deal with malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1348
01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1349
01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:36.280
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

1350
01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:38.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm open for any research and</v>

1351
01:15:38.801 --> 01:15:40.560
<v Speaker 2>investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in,</v>

1352
01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:43.990
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Mother Nature and Mother Nature came</v>

1353
01:15:43.991 --> 01:15:48.991
<v Speaker 2>to me and I got so much field work done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know all the tricks of Mother Nature</v>

1354
01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:54.690
<v Speaker 2>and what it does in the body and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgot about it because we never expose</v>

1355
01:15:54.691 --> 01:15:59.200
<v Speaker 2>ourselves in mother nature anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We always take the choice of comfort,</v>

1356
01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we actually built to be stimulated</v>

1357
01:16:03.641 --> 01:16:06.340
<v Speaker 2>by wind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold heat,</v>

1358
01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:11.530
<v Speaker 2>pressure differences and all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and that makes us strong.</v>

1359
01:16:11.531 --> 01:16:14.770
<v Speaker 2>It makes our immune system strong and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then bacteria,</v>

1360
01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:19.771
<v Speaker 2>viruses and back so suddenly have a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>less chance to get in and do their</v>

1361
01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:20.973
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>

1362
01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:24.070
<v Speaker 2>And at this it's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not me.</v>

1363
01:16:24.071 --> 01:16:28.240
<v Speaker 2>It's mother nature within us and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>control we lost because we lost the</v>

1364
01:16:28.241 --> 01:16:31.900
<v Speaker 2>connection and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very important to bring that.</v>

1365
01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:34.590
<v Speaker 2>And I think malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1366
01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.930
<v Speaker 2>we can now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only,</v>

1367
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:43.750
<v Speaker 2>it's also in the books now in hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly a university books.</v>

1368
01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Possibly hope for people with HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend,</v>

1369
01:16:48.731 --> 01:16:52.180
<v Speaker 2>my friend Justin Wren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does a lot of work with the pygmies.</v>

1370
01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:57.160
<v Speaker 2>He works with water four and he builds</v>
<v Speaker 2>wells in the Congo and he's had malaria</v>

1371
01:16:57.161 --> 01:17:01.750
<v Speaker 2>three times and when he gets it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty bad and not only does he get</v>

1372
01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:03.550
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now because he's had it so many</v>

1373
01:17:03.551 --> 01:17:05.110
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets it if he gets sick.</v>

1374
01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:08.680
<v Speaker 2>So when he's in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he catches the flu or something like</v>

1375
01:17:08.681 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he also gets malaria.</v>

1376
01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:12.290
<v Speaker 2>It's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flammatory markers,</v>

1377
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:15.020
<v Speaker 2>deregulation of the immune system that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could help him.</v>

1378
01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to.</v>

01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:34.220
<v Speaker 2>He's done amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing stuff.</v>

1385
01:17:34.221 --> 01:17:36.680

1386
01:17:36.681 --> 01:17:39.060

<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine he's a pioneer.</v>

1387
01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to feel like we began off.</v>

<v Speaker 2>human mankind,</v>

1390
01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:57.270
<v Speaker 2>and to finally get into some love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a sharing and caring tribal.</v>

1391
01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:00.680
<v Speaker 2>So what happened when your son?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1392
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:04.640
<v Speaker 2>So I went through this reserve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big Serengeti,</v>

1393
01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:10.160
<v Speaker 2>and then you got these big elephants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luxor don't or Luxor don't.</v>

1394
01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Africana know big stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1395
01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh?</v>

1396
01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:17.270
<v Speaker 2>They can go up to seven tons of meat.</v>

1397
01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:22.840
<v Speaker 2>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to a lot of these big elephants</v>

1398
01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:29.940
<v Speaker 2>and I lifted up there till two in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and to see how big the asshole is.</v>

1399
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:34.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a lot of big hassles.</v>

1400
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:39.970
<v Speaker 2>My son is still the and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made the phone call.</v>

1401
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:45.290
<v Speaker 2>It's all about fun because I love to</v>
<v Speaker 2>joke about.</v>

1402
01:18:45.291 --> 01:18:48.800
<v Speaker 2>He is to a very severe with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1403
01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:51.190
<v Speaker 2>he can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said it's sitting there very to</v>

1404
01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:54.520
<v Speaker 2>inquiry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he can be like a wolf with her.</v>

1405
01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Her Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1406
01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.760
<v Speaker 2>not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said I asked him to not talk during</v>

1407
01:18:58.761 --> 01:19:01.310
<v Speaker 2>the show and now you're egging them on</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're forcing them to defend</v>

1408
01:19:01.311 --> 01:19:03.350
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's totally unfair.</v>

1409
01:19:04.650 --> 01:19:08.000
<v Speaker 2>An asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes my business,</v>

1410
01:19:08.001 --> 01:19:12.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mission and it makes it able to</v>

1411
01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:15.230
<v Speaker 2>happen in this world because I'm not of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this world.</v>

1412
01:19:15.231 --> 01:19:16.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm too much of nature.</v>

1413
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm so naive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he is outlining everything with</v>

1414
01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:24.710
<v Speaker 2>websites of activity to people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not of this world.</v>

1415
01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:30.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of the modern world</v>
<v Speaker 2>electronics and that shit you just not</v>

1416
01:19:31.930 --> 01:19:33.140
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a cell phone?</v>

1417
01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1418
01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duh.</v>

1419
01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.520
<v Speaker 2>I lose them a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1420
01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.910
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1421
01:19:40.911 --> 01:19:44.180
<v Speaker 2>what happened with the cell phones a in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finland,</v>

1422
01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:47.200
<v Speaker 2>lapland or [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alaska where they live,</v>

1423
01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:49.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in distance with each other.</v>

1424
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Telepathy is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And where there's no cell phones.</v>

1425
01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where there's no cell phones.</v>

1426
01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:00.090
<v Speaker 2>But since the telephone came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a introduce itself over there,</v>

1427
01:20:00.850 --> 01:20:03.380
<v Speaker 2>the people lost this ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

1428
01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1429
01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 2>what they knew every time one day a</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbor is coming</v>

1430
01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:13.430
<v Speaker 4>that are already setting things up</v>
<v Speaker 4>without seeing it with the eyes and ears</v>

1431
01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:16.360
<v Speaker 4>and that's common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

1432
01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:21.890
<v Speaker 4>D Cell phones game and they take it over</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we have to learn that we all have</v>

1433
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:26.960
<v Speaker 4>these not only physiological abilities</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeper but also in the mind a beautiful</v>

1434
01:20:29.521 --> 01:20:34.521
<v Speaker 4>things and we are having it taken over</v>
<v Speaker 4>by tech technical devices and all that.</v>

1435
01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:42.670
<v Speaker 4>But whereas the contact with our</v>
<v Speaker 4>conscious contact with our depth,</v>

1436
01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.380
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm going for it.</v>

1437
01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:48.570
<v Speaker 3>But is there any evidence these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>were really telepathic?</v>

1438
01:20:50.850 --> 01:20:52.920
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's anecdotal of course,</v>

1439
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:55.940
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people full of shit out there living</v>

1440
01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:00.340
<v Speaker 3>by themselves just doing weird shit to</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves out there screaming.</v>

1441
01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:03.960
<v Speaker 3>No one answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lone wolves howl.</v>

1442
01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.810
<v Speaker 3>There was a too old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1443
01:21:06.811 --> 01:21:09.030
<v Speaker 3>you gotta take that into account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are full of Shit.</v>

1444
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:12.630
<v Speaker 3>You got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was an old television show on the</v>

1445
01:21:12.631 --> 01:21:15.510
<v Speaker 3>road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember on the road with Charles</v>

1446
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:16.343
<v Speaker 3>Kuralt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that who it was?</v>

1447
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:19.950
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy that used to have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>television shows way back in the day</v>

1448
01:21:19.951 --> 01:21:22.200
<v Speaker 3>before the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember he had this episode on</v>

1449
01:21:22.201 --> 01:21:24.420
<v Speaker 3>whether it was talking to this guy who</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a.</v>

1450
01:21:25.050 --> 01:21:30.050
<v Speaker 3>He was a trapper and he would live in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bush and Alaska and he would live</v>

1451
01:21:30.781 --> 01:21:35.250
<v Speaker 3>there and not talk to a single person</v>
<v Speaker 3>for months and months at a time,</v>

1452
01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:40.580
<v Speaker 3>and what he would say is that after a</v>
<v Speaker 3>while when he was out there by himself,</v>

1453
01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:45.980
<v Speaker 3>he would develop this very bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling of telepathic,</v>

1454
01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:51.120
<v Speaker 3>of telepathy with animals and that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>could read animals minds.</v>

1455
01:21:51.190 --> 01:21:55.320
<v Speaker 3>You could almost predict their behavior</v>
<v Speaker 3>and movements and he was getting signals</v>

1456
01:21:55.321 --> 01:22:00.321
<v Speaker 3>from them that he couldn't describe and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he would go back to the town,</v>

1457
01:22:01.530 --> 01:22:03.090
<v Speaker 3>when he would come back after six</v>
<v Speaker 3>months,</v>

1458
01:22:03.091 --> 01:22:06.000
<v Speaker 3>after a couple of hours or a day or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would go away.</v>

1459
01:22:06.690 --> 01:22:10.140
<v Speaker 3>And it was like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thing was interesting when he had</v>

1460
01:22:10.141 --> 01:22:12.590
<v Speaker 3>no contact with people and he swore by</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1461
01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:15.600
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be a fucking crazy dude out</v>

1462
01:22:15.601 --> 01:22:16.434
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1463
01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:18.930
<v Speaker 3>the Muskrat's with a giant trap.</v>

1464
01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:23.720
<v Speaker 4>It's anecdotal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are social mammals,</v>

1465
01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:26.630
<v Speaker 4>mammalian behavior like families and</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like that,</v>

1466
01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:27.550
<v Speaker 4>but I've read that</v>

1467
01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:32.550
<v Speaker 3>I have found one thing that they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty sure that people can tell and</v>

1468
01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.730
<v Speaker 3>that is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard.</v>

1469
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:36.760
<v Speaker 3>It was rupert sheldrake's podcast he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

1470
01:22:37.210 --> 01:22:42.210
<v Speaker 3>He was saying that one thing that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have studied beyond statistical</v>

1471
01:22:42.371 --> 01:22:46.090
<v Speaker 3>probability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shows that when people are stared at,</v>

1472
01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:50.580
<v Speaker 3>like say if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I turned my back and um,</v>

1473
01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:55.000
<v Speaker 3>you either would look down at your lap</v>
<v Speaker 3>or look at the back of my head that I</v>

1474
01:22:55.001 --> 01:22:59.980
<v Speaker 3>could tell or someone maybe some people</v>
<v Speaker 3>can tell whether or not you're looking</v>

1475
01:22:59.981 --> 01:23:04.981
<v Speaker 3>at them more than half the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were more accurate than guessing.</v>

1476
01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.980
<v Speaker 3>And it was consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty consistent.</v>

1477
01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:13.510
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't 100 percent of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't 50 slash 50.</v>

1478
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:17.150
<v Speaker 3>It was more like 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 rupert cherish held,</v>

1479
01:23:17.151 --> 01:23:17.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1480
01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:20.140
<v Speaker 3>Interesting things he tells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1481
01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:22.240
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

1482
01:23:22.290 --> 01:23:23.230
<v Speaker 3>when the birds</v>

1483
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:26.050
<v Speaker 2>in in say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Second World War,</v>

1484
01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:27.311
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1485
01:23:27.311 --> 01:23:32.311
<v Speaker 2>getting into these mil bottles with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>silver top,</v>

1486
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:35.890
<v Speaker 2>they learned to pick through</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

1487
01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:40.990
<v Speaker 2>And the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the distance between say England and the</v>

1488
01:23:40.991 --> 01:23:45.991
<v Speaker 2>Netherlands or Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc. Is a divided by a northern city and</v>

1489
01:23:47.681 --> 01:23:52.300
<v Speaker 2>these words are not able to travel the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other side to the other side,</v>

1490
01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:57.640
<v Speaker 2>but the same birds were able,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same species of birds at the other</v>

1491
01:23:57.641 --> 01:24:00.560
<v Speaker 2>side were able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1492
01:24:00.610 --> 01:24:01.990
<v Speaker 2>day began to do the same.</v>

1493
01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:05.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a term wIth monkeys and fall age</v>

1494
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:08.650
<v Speaker 3>or resonance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>morphic resonance.</v>

1495
01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:13.240
<v Speaker 3>And what he believes is that when one</v>
<v Speaker 3>member of the species attempts to learn</v>

1496
01:24:13.241 --> 01:24:18.130
<v Speaker 3>something or learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes far easier for other members</v>

1497
01:24:18.131 --> 01:24:22.810
<v Speaker 3>of the species even that are separated</v>
<v Speaker 3>by vast distances to learn that.</v>

1498
01:24:22.811 --> 01:24:27.811
<v Speaker 3>And I think he said that occurred with</v>
<v Speaker 3>rats in a very particular maze that they</v>

1499
01:24:27.881 --> 01:24:31.360
<v Speaker 3>would teach rats how to get through a</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular maize in one part of the</v>

1500
01:24:31.361 --> 01:24:32.980
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then rats and the other part of the</v>

1501
01:24:32.981 --> 01:24:37.180
<v Speaker 3>world navigated it much quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some interesting stuff when it</v>

1502
01:24:37.181 --> 01:24:38.290
<v Speaker 3>comes to that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1503
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:40.570
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is interesting,</v>

1504
01:24:40.571 --> 01:24:43.540
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard because there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people call bullshit and I don't know</v>

1505
01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:46.000
<v Speaker 3>who's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you gotta kinda go over it with a</v>

1506
01:24:46.001 --> 01:24:51.001
<v Speaker 3>fine tooth comb and look at everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at their motivations and look at</v>

1507
01:24:51.551 --> 01:24:55.000
<v Speaker 3>whether or not they're biased and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to sort out.</v>

1508
01:24:55.150 --> 01:24:58.180
<v Speaker 3>But rupert seems like a very thoughtful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very interesting guy.</v>

1509
01:24:58.210 --> 01:24:59.890
<v Speaker 3>He definitely didn't seem dishonest.</v>

1510
01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

1511
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:07.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say a little bit about what we did.</v>

1512
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:08.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me</v>

1513
01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:15.260
<v Speaker 2>a censure last year so that the goals</v>
<v Speaker 2>now are to get it into a national</v>

1514
01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:21.580
<v Speaker 2>healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually any every country but in</v>

1515
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:24.550
<v Speaker 2>America is a little bit a leader there</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1516
01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:28.900
<v Speaker 2>And I'm beginning to become quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous.</v>

1517
01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:31.420
<v Speaker 2>I use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use it,</v>

1518
01:25:31.421 --> 01:25:35.230
<v Speaker 2>abuse it to get my goals done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mission done,</v>

1519
01:25:35.650 --> 01:25:40.650
<v Speaker 2>which is bringing a belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a confidence love,</v>

1520
01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:47.170
<v Speaker 2>but now scientifically endorsed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing that we are able to tap into all</v>

1521
01:25:47.171 --> 01:25:51.730
<v Speaker 2>those systems and we should actually get</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in school,</v>

1522
01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:57.120
<v Speaker 2>in primary school to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not only learn like history and</v>

1523
01:25:57.881 --> 01:26:02.881
<v Speaker 2>geography and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now learn at a young age</v>

1524
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:09.340
<v Speaker 4>how to influence into this hormonal</v>
<v Speaker 4>system and immune system or say</v>

1525
01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:13.310
<v Speaker 4>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strength,</v>

1526
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:18.550
<v Speaker 4>health shoot be subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I teach kids of four years old with</v>

1527
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:24.920
<v Speaker 4>arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They come and they are very able to do</v>

1528
01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:29.090
<v Speaker 4>breathing exercises going into cold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually children.</v>

1529
01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:34.220
<v Speaker 4>We teach him to have coal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>john and therefore,</v>

1530
01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:36.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taken away the stimulation of the</v>

1531
01:26:36.531 --> 01:26:40.850
<v Speaker 4>natural element,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thus decreasing the activity of their</v>

1532
01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.800
<v Speaker 4>systems inside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We make them sick instead of protecting</v>

1533
01:26:45.801 --> 01:26:48.200
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are comforting them.</v>

1534
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:51.590
<v Speaker 4>And we think that paradigm shift needs</v>
<v Speaker 4>to happen.</v>

1535
01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.920
<v Speaker 4>And I'm into that and now it's getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>together with a existent healthcare.</v>

1536
01:26:58.070 --> 01:27:03.070
<v Speaker 4>And with universities more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we got to go back to say nature.</v>

1537
01:27:05.121 --> 01:27:10.121
<v Speaker 4>And if her mother is able to guarantee</v>
<v Speaker 4>by endorsed by scientific evidence that</v>

1538
01:27:12.201 --> 01:27:16.430
<v Speaker 4>we are able to tap in to all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>systems guaranteeing,</v>

1539
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:19.880
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you just breathe better and take a</v>

1540
01:27:19.881 --> 01:27:24.881
<v Speaker 4>cold shower and believe connect with</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body that you are able to tap into</v>

1541
01:27:27.111 --> 01:27:31.340
<v Speaker 4>your health,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your happiness and your strength,</v>

1542
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:36.910
<v Speaker 4>then that's something that will bring</v>
<v Speaker 4>mother nature back in us and awareness</v>

1543
01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:41.250
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1544
01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:46.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from will make this world a value.</v>

1545
01:27:47.190 --> 01:27:52.190
<v Speaker 4>The nature outside as inside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we lost a connection.</v>

1546
01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:58.640
<v Speaker 4>And I'm now here to bring that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And since last year I've progressed,</v>

1547
01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:01.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like anxiety and fear,</v>

1548
01:28:01.461 --> 01:28:04.520
<v Speaker 4>nobody knows about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I do know what it is.</v>

1549
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:09.440
<v Speaker 4>I know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is biochemical and neurological.</v>

1550
01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:12.840
<v Speaker 4>I talk with professors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I teach them the,</v>

1551
01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:13.551
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

<v Speaker 4>the method and together we get a more</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of it.</v>

1554
01:28:20.850 --> 01:28:22.850
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1577
01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:32.550
<v Speaker 4>this time because the difference in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>numbers of staggering.</v>

1578
01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:35.430
<v Speaker 4>like what was the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the monthly downloads last</v>

<v Speaker 4>year?</v>

1580
01:29:37.650 --> 01:29:42.090
<v Speaker 4>Just take a guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably like 15,</v>

01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:15.100
<v Speaker 4>It's just I'm this chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not on audio.</v>

1613
01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:20.740
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's dripping and ya know,</v>

1614
01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:26.240
<v Speaker 4>davis endocrine system and it's dripping</v>
<v Speaker 4>a long as the orange has and that it's</v>

1615
01:31:26.671 --> 01:31:31.671
<v Speaker 4>flickering together with the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Looks like will our enormous and the</v>

1616
01:31:32.191 --> 01:31:37.191
<v Speaker 4>light is upon it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he walks a among the street and a</v>

1617
01:31:41.970 --> 01:31:44.750
<v Speaker 4>big lips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big cheek,</v>

1618
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.850
<v Speaker 4>big claws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very peaceful.</v>

1619
01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:49.740
<v Speaker 4>He has no enemy.</v>

1620
01:31:50.190 --> 01:31:55.190
<v Speaker 4>He's there just by being himself and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's easily as a bar.</v>

1621
01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:57.930
<v Speaker 4>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in his mind,</v>

1622
01:31:57.931 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 4>kept pops up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chest is</v>

1623
01:32:02.130 --> 01:32:07.130
<v Speaker 4>a golden bear and he sees it within.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's already driven from it or from his</v>

1624
01:32:10.181 --> 01:32:14.260
<v Speaker 4>lips is coming down and he goes through</v>
<v Speaker 4>the door.</v>

1625
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:19.690
<v Speaker 4>He's got quite some difficulty to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>through the though because he's so big,</v>

1626
01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:25.200
<v Speaker 4>really squeezes himself through the door</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there he sees his stool.</v>

1627
01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:31.560
<v Speaker 4>He goes through the stool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's really big and the stool is</v>

1628
01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:35.460
<v Speaker 4>only so big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's got a,</v>

1629
01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:38.710
<v Speaker 4>he's into a balancing act not to fall</v>
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>

1630
01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:39.680
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1631
01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:44.050
<v Speaker 4>so big a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But finally he gets there and he</v>

1632
01:32:44.051 --> 01:32:47.040
<v Speaker 4>accomplishes this balancing act and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there.</v>

1633
01:32:47.130 --> 01:32:49.650
<v Speaker 4>He's at ease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course the bomber.</v>

1634
01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:54.780
<v Speaker 4>We flat into a corner somewhere and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

1635
01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:56.450
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He's peaceful.</v>

1638
01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:04.300
<v Speaker 4>He's at ease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1639
01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:07.440
<v Speaker 4>These pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll talk to the bartender zia money</v>

1640
01:33:07.730 --> 01:33:09.490
<v Speaker 4>stealing this beer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1641
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:11.890
<v Speaker 4>He has no pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he has got money.</v>

1642
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:15.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why he stashed it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's there.</v>

1643
01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:17.480
<v Speaker 4>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1644
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:20.620
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1645
01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:25.960
<v Speaker 4>he's very peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The orangutan show,</v>

1646
01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:31.200
<v Speaker 4>his fear is subsiding and he comes and</v>
<v Speaker 4>still and that he gives us to to like</v>

1647
01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:37.320
<v Speaker 4>this and then it gets a bear claw around</v>
<v Speaker 4>this little glass or a golden bear lake.</v>

1648
01:33:41.150 --> 01:33:46.150
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at it</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a little baby.</v>

1649
01:33:48.970 --> 01:33:53.860
<v Speaker 4>He's a dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He puts it back</v>

1650
01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:59.230
<v Speaker 4>and he puts a $100 bill on the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On the bar,</v>

1651
01:33:59.710 --> 01:34:01.580
<v Speaker 4>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the tap as bar.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>$100.</v>

1653
01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:08.900
<v Speaker 4>Now suddenly the bar man things what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But because he is a very peaceful.</v>

1654
01:34:09.551 --> 01:34:12.060

<v Speaker 4>You enjoy this beer?</v>

1655
01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:17.630
<v Speaker 4>He got a $100.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm going to give him back at my</v>

1656
01:34:17.631 --> 01:34:21.010
<v Speaker 4>shiny coin because he doesn't know about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the significance of,</v>

1657
01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:26.280
<v Speaker 4>of money and he gives him a shiny coat</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he takes the $100 bill and I don't</v>

1658
01:34:30.071 --> 01:34:33.040
<v Speaker 4>know where he puts it because he's got</v>
<v Speaker 4>no pockets,</v>

1659
01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:37.540
<v Speaker 4>but he puts it somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks at it and puts it somewhere and</v>

1660
01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:42.630
<v Speaker 4>he sits there and finally the obama got</v>
<v Speaker 4>his confidence so much.</v>

1661
01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:45.680
<v Speaker 4>He asks you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1662
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:49.750

1665
01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:04.700
<v Speaker 4>and that's the punchline and the thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1666
01:35:06.130 --> 01:35:11.130
<v Speaker 4>the thing is this is the way we think we</v>
<v Speaker 4>can mess up with a trake,</v>

1667
01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:16.910
<v Speaker 4>our inner power.</v>

1668
01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:22.060
<v Speaker 4>we are straw man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we always think bad about who we are</v>

1669
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.870
<v Speaker 4>in the depth</v>

1670

<v Speaker 4>that up a little bit.</v>

1673
01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:38.590
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I knew what was coming towards the end,</v>

1675
01:35:41.710 --> 01:35:43.630
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a professional comedian.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but I knew I always extended I that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>now use it as a metaphor because that's</v>

1680
01:35:57.911 --> 01:36:00.700
<v Speaker 4>no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's real wood.</v>

1681
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:04.720

<v Speaker 4>us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing I found on the entire</v>

1727
01:38:05.101 --> 01:38:05.934
<v Speaker 4>internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1728
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:11.000
<v Speaker 4>some guy claimed he did 72 after taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>that jack three d stuff with one brand</v>

1729
01:38:11.250 --> 01:38:14.700
<v Speaker 4>after taking a five minute breathing</v>
<v Speaker 4>exercise and then no breasts and you did</v>

1730
01:38:14.701 --> 01:38:19.701
<v Speaker 4>72 people so they'd like 40 or 50</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathing would've helped like a similar</v>

1731
01:38:20.131 --> 01:38:21.810
<v Speaker 4>method to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they weren't talking about.</v>

1732
01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:24.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a feeling your friend might be a</v>

1733
01:38:24.791 --> 01:38:26.500
<v Speaker 3>little full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't.</v>

1734
01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:30.880
<v Speaker 3>As an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as someone who understands the potential</v>

1735
01:38:30.881 --> 01:38:33.430
<v Speaker 3>of the human body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be extraordinary.</v>

1736
01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:37.120
<v Speaker 3>You have to be pretty extraordinary to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do 80 push ups on your own.</v>

1737
01:38:37.121 --> 01:38:40.300
<v Speaker 3>You have to be conditioned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like just a force,</v>

1738
01:38:40.301 --> 01:38:42.700
<v Speaker 3>your muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending upon how much you weigh of</v>

1739
01:38:42.701 --> 01:38:46.020
<v Speaker 3>course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're the average 175 pound or</v>

1740
01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:50.370
<v Speaker 3>whatever the average man is to just to</v>
<v Speaker 3>force yourself to do 80 pushups,</v>

1741
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:52.390
<v Speaker 3>you have to be in pretty good condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To do that,</v>

1742
01:38:52.450 --> 01:38:55.150
<v Speaker 3>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of repetition.</v>

1743
01:38:55.570 --> 01:38:57.130
<v Speaker 3>You're essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not like you're bench</v>

1744
01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:59.470
<v Speaker 3>pressing 175 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's probably like a bench</v>

1745
01:38:59.471 --> 01:39:00.610
<v Speaker 3>precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One 40,</v>

1746
01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:03.610
<v Speaker 3>like how much would you think it would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be like a pushup?</v>

1747
01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:06.250
<v Speaker 3>How much you actually pushing up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I weighed 200 pounds,</v>

1748
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:09.400
<v Speaker 3>if I'm doing a pushup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much am I actually pushing because</v>

1749
01:39:09.401 --> 01:39:12.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really pushing 200 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 3>because my feet are on the ground and</v>

1750
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:14.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1751
01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:19.000
<v Speaker 3>there's some weight down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much am I actually pushing?</v>

1752
01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:25.020
<v Speaker 3>It feels like I'm pushing about 130,</v>
<v Speaker 3>140 pounds when I do a push up</v>

1753
01:39:25.810 --> 01:39:28.420
<v Speaker 4>60 slash 70 percent of your body weight</v>
<v Speaker 4>price.</v>

1754
01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:31.360
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you go try to google something</v>

1755
01:39:31.361 --> 01:39:32.194
<v Speaker 4>like google</v>

1756
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:36.630
<v Speaker 3>percentage of your body weight or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually lifting when you do a pushup.</v>

1757
01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1758
01:39:37.921 --> 01:39:39.450
<v Speaker 3>because I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely not a 100</v>

1759
01:39:39.970 --> 01:39:44.970
<v Speaker 4>that's analyze it and I really began</v>
<v Speaker 4>with these pushups and now everybody is</v>

1760
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:49.310
<v Speaker 4>health course copying and I know what a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>

1761
01:39:49.311 --> 01:39:52.520
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I like to like research.</v>

1762
01:39:52.530 --> 01:39:55.100
<v Speaker 4>I like to investigate what we are really</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>

1763
01:39:55.150 --> 01:39:55.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1764
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:58.160
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forty nine percent.</v>

1765
01:39:58.161 --> 01:39:59.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>regular pushup,</v>

1766
01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:02.870
<v Speaker 3>you live 64 percent of your body weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas with a knee pushup,</v>

1767
01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:05.050
<v Speaker 3>your pushup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a regular pushup,</v>

1768
01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:09.590
<v Speaker 3>64 percent of your body weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me it's a little over 100 was</v>

1769
01:40:09.710 --> 01:40:11.540
<v Speaker 3>110,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that?</v>

1770
01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:14.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One 14,</v>

1771
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:16.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixty four.</v>

1772
01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:18.790
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

1773
01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:19.730
<v Speaker 3>28.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1774
01:40:19.731 --> 01:40:22.030
<v Speaker 3>So I was pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixty four posole.</v>

1775
01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.050
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking it was like 1:30,</v>

1776
01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:27.130
<v Speaker 3>1:44.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1777
01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:29.390
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1778
01:40:29.391 --> 01:40:31.970
<v Speaker 3>so that's what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do 80 pushups.</v>

1779
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:35.570
<v Speaker 3>I can't do any pushups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is breathing was I don't think I can.</v>

1780
01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:40.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't do pushups on much bench press,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavier weights and I do a lot of their</v>

1781
01:40:40.401 --> 01:40:43.190
<v Speaker 3>stuff while scaring me without</v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing.</v>

1782
01:40:45.970 --> 01:40:47.030
<v Speaker 3>BreAthing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So powerful.</v>

1783
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:50.750
<v Speaker 3>I can't we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you doIng now?</v>

1784
01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:52.993
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

1785
01:40:53.090 --> 01:40:58.090
<v Speaker 3>It's a nose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The what's the world record pushups.</v>

1786
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:01.750
<v Speaker 3>How many things the world record in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>row?</v>

1787
01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:07.200
<v Speaker 3>I bet it's like $300 for without leaving</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pushup position in 1987.</v>

1788
01:41:08.471 --> 01:41:10.840
<v Speaker 3>We did a 3000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seventy two times for women.</v>

1789
01:41:10.841 --> 01:41:14.320
<v Speaker 3>It's 300 to</v>
<v Speaker 3>3000.</v>

1790
01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:16.000
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can stay there all day.</v>

1791
01:41:16.001 --> 01:41:17.500
<v Speaker 3>They get to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no time limit on that.</v>

1792
01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:20.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can go down and rest and then</v>

1793
01:41:20.201 --> 01:41:21.540
<v Speaker 3>push yourself back up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stuff up.</v>

1794
01:41:21.670 --> 01:41:24.970
<v Speaker 3>Probably even for like an hour if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want it to jesus christ.</v>

1795
01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:28.700
<v Speaker 3>What about in a row?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about consecutive no arrest record?</v>

1796
01:41:28.701 --> 01:41:32.500
<v Speaker 3>Second an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there a consecutive most pushups?</v>

1797
01:41:32.501 --> 01:41:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Nonstop is 10,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>500.</v>

1798
01:41:37.690 --> 01:41:41.110
<v Speaker 3>Some revelation going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>

1799
01:41:41.111 --> 01:41:43.990
<v Speaker 3>what kind of a fucking freaked as 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushups.</v>

1800
01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:46.990
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>

1801
01:41:46.991 --> 01:41:48.940
<v Speaker 3>Look at what they're defining as</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushups.</v>

1802
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a look at their pushups.</v>

1803
01:41:51.970 --> 01:41:53.740
<v Speaker 3>They don't go all the way down those</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucks.</v>

1804
01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.270
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this is what the</v>

1805
01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:01.860
<v Speaker 3>counting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey you gotta touch your chin.</v>

1806
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:09.790
<v Speaker 3>The world record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's defined though.</v>

1807
01:42:09.791 --> 01:42:13.930
<v Speaker 3>It's defined by a specific degree of</v>
<v Speaker 3>bend in your arms.</v>

1808
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:17.740
<v Speaker 3>What counts is a pushup is it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially when your arm,</v>

1809
01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:21.940
<v Speaker 3>your upper arm is 90 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's when your upper arm is parallel to</v>

1810
01:42:21.941 --> 01:42:22.774
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1811
01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:24.540
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1812
01:42:24.970 --> 01:42:27.490
<v Speaker 3>And your lower arms straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now.</v>

1813
01:42:28.110 --> 01:42:30.790
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirty $800 an hour at 3:38.</v>

1814
01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.730
<v Speaker 3>Seventy seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus christ.</v>

1815
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:36.370
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy probably couldn't even tie his</v>

1816
01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:39.640
<v Speaker 3>shoes the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably tore himself apart.</v>

1817
01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:41.980
<v Speaker 3>We went to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1818
01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:46.690
<v Speaker 3>we should get wim hoff together with</v>
<v Speaker 3>louie simmons about that.</v>

1819
01:42:47.890 --> 01:42:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Do you know Louis Simmons and simmons is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a madman.</v>

1820
01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:54.790
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a very famous power lifter.</v>

1821
01:42:55.390 --> 01:42:58.930
<v Speaker 3>And every single part of his body has</v>
<v Speaker 3>been broken.</v>

1822
01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:02.080
<v Speaker 3>He's in his sixties and he's been on</v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids.</v>

1823
01:43:02.081 --> 01:43:06.370
<v Speaker 3>It's 1970.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's louie simmons has no biceps.</v>

1824
01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:09.340
<v Speaker 3>I think in this picture you probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>still had biceps.</v>

1825
01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:13.720
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His biceps have torn off of the,</v>

1826
01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:17.890
<v Speaker 3>off of the bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he lifts his arms over his head,</v>

1827
01:43:17.891 --> 01:43:22.420
<v Speaker 3>he blacks out because he's so damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She has so much neck and,</v>

1828
01:43:22.421 --> 01:43:27.100
<v Speaker 3>and tissue damage is a fucking maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a character he is though.</v>

1829
01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:27.931
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1830
01:43:27.931 --> 01:43:30.160
<v Speaker 3>we interviewed him last month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to his gym.</v>

1831
01:43:30.161 --> 01:43:31.840
<v Speaker 3>He's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really famous powerlifter.</v>

1832
01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:35.980
<v Speaker 3>He's actually a genius when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the construction of exercise equipment.</v>

1833
01:43:36.130 --> 01:43:38.260
<v Speaker 3>We have one of his pieces of equipment</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the back.</v>

1834
01:43:38.261 --> 01:43:39.460
<v Speaker 3>It's called the reverse hyper.</v>

1835
01:43:39.610 --> 01:43:42.130
<v Speaker 3>That damn thing changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll show it to you afterwards.</v>

1836
01:43:42.370 --> 01:43:43.091
<v Speaker 3>You could see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1837
01:43:43.091 --> 01:43:46.590
<v Speaker 3>it actively decompresses the spine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say that's a,</v>

1838
01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:50.620
<v Speaker 3>the lifting up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on the lifting down it goes under</v>

1839
01:43:50.621 --> 01:43:52.670
<v Speaker 3>the weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes underneath that bench and it</v>

1840
01:43:52.671 --> 01:43:57.620
<v Speaker 3>actually pulls apart your spine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It decompresses the spine.</v>

1841
01:43:57.621 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 3>So all of the gravity and the stress and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the different measures they could</v>

1842
01:44:02.181 --> 01:44:04.460
<v Speaker 3>see how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's an amazing piece of equipment.</v>

1843
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:05.311
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>louis,</v>

1844
01:44:05.311 --> 01:44:06.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>invented that.</v>

1845
01:44:06.201 --> 01:44:09.380
<v Speaker 3>He's got some great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great ideas about power lifting,</v>

1846
01:44:09.381 --> 01:44:11.810
<v Speaker 3>but he's just like many brilliant</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1847
01:44:11.811 --> 01:44:15.440
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great way and a great way.</v>

1848
01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:17.690
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1849
01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:19.100
<v Speaker 3>you and him together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could fix them,</v>

1850
01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:22.180
<v Speaker 3>get them breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't let me just start swearing,</v>

1851
01:44:22.610 --> 01:44:24.230
<v Speaker 3>throwing shit around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do some steroids.</v>

1852
01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:29.320
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1853
01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:37.770
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a lot more facts going on,</v>

1854
01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:43.040
<v Speaker 4>really are progressing with the science</v>
<v Speaker 4>and becoming more famous and we are</v>

1855
01:44:43.831 --> 01:44:47.730
<v Speaker 4>reaching out more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A very powerful people.</v>

1856
01:44:47.731 --> 01:44:52.731
<v Speaker 4>Famous people are beginning to get the</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea and they will help me in the</v>

1857
01:44:54.090 --> 01:44:57.540
<v Speaker 4>Indiana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to do charity because I did</v>

1858
01:44:57.541 --> 01:44:59.910
<v Speaker 4>already the breakthroughs within the</v>
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>

1859
01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:01.930
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1860
01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:04.980
<v Speaker 4>now I want to do charity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1861
01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:09.060
<v Speaker 4>That like we were talking about Tanzania</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1862
01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:14.070
<v Speaker 4>and the resource and the messiah and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>messiah before they were the men who are</v>

1863
01:45:14.551 --> 01:45:18.930
<v Speaker 4>able to stand off a line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they are dealing with fear.</v>

1864
01:45:19.650 --> 01:45:24.650
<v Speaker 4>They become a lion is able to smell fear</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1865
01:45:25.950 --> 01:45:29.790
<v Speaker 4>animals like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's reactive.</v>

1866
01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:31.810
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's our hormones,</v>

1867
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:36.780
<v Speaker 4>but people have it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's why we go in cars through</v>

1868
01:45:36.781 --> 01:45:41.781
<v Speaker 4>these reserves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>etc. Now I found that that fear is</v>

1869
01:45:43.771 --> 01:45:48.771
<v Speaker 4>actually coming in within our</v>
<v Speaker 4>subconscious fear because we are not</v>

1870
01:45:49.690 --> 01:45:51.210
<v Speaker 4>acting natural anymore.</v>

1871
01:45:51.450 --> 01:45:55.020
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we alienated from nature and we have</v>

1872
01:45:55.021 --> 01:45:57.390
<v Speaker 4>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are able to walk in a city with an</v>

1873
01:45:57.391 --> 01:45:58.490
<v Speaker 4>attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>

1874
01:45:58.710 --> 01:46:03.090
<v Speaker 4>But do it now in front of the line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you become fearful because you know</v>

1875
01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:08.190
<v Speaker 4>you are not able to cope with that</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation and you have to be peaceful.</v>

1876
01:46:08.191 --> 01:46:11.880
<v Speaker 4>You have to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you then the line will not attack</v>

1877
01:46:11.881 --> 01:46:15.360
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It only attacks when it's hungry and you</v>

1878
01:46:15.361 --> 01:46:17.820
<v Speaker 4>can see things and all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those things.</v>

1879
01:46:18.330 --> 01:46:22.680
<v Speaker 4>But if you have no fear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could just pass by a couple of</v>

1880
01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:25.980
<v Speaker 4>meters from alliance in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm,</v>

1881
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:27.570
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is what I'm,</v>

1882
01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:29.050
<v Speaker 4>who knows this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1883
01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:31.320
<v Speaker 4>me and the maasai.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you done it?</v>

1884
01:46:31.730 --> 01:46:32.570
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1885
01:46:32.610 --> 01:46:34.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm with a massage.</v>

1886
01:46:34.530 --> 01:46:36.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm with the maasai.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1887
01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:37.553
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1888
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:41.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called garden garden of eden</v>

1889
01:46:41.970 --> 01:46:45.630
<v Speaker 4>project.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That means with really wild animals like</v>

1890
01:46:45.810 --> 01:46:47.460
<v Speaker 4>hyenas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>elephants,</v>

1891
01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:49.230
<v Speaker 4>giraffes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lions.</v>

1892
01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 4>I want to show you</v>

1893
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.650
<v Speaker 2>a picture before you engage in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous adventure.</v>

1894
01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:57.150
<v Speaker 2>It was a photo of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a photographer that climbed out</v>

1895
01:46:57.151 --> 01:46:58.560
<v Speaker 2>of his jeep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see that photo?</v>

1896
01:46:58.570 --> 01:47:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Remember it was in the daily mail where</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a series of photographs were a</v>

1897
01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:07.030
<v Speaker 2>lion was going to pounce on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It literally jumped towards him and</v>

1898
01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:09.450
<v Speaker 2>opened its mouth and this guy got</v>
<v Speaker 2>photos.</v>

1899
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:14.370
<v Speaker 2>I think it was inside of like 30 or 40</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet when the lion finally stopped,</v>

1900
01:47:14.371 --> 01:47:16.950
<v Speaker 2>but they are some of the most terrifying</v>
<v Speaker 2>photos.</v>

1901
01:47:17.970 --> 01:47:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Photographer gets shots of lion before</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it almost attacked him.</v>

1902
01:47:23.850 --> 01:47:25.830
<v Speaker 2>See if he could find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have them on my phone.</v>

1903
01:47:25.831 --> 01:47:27.060
<v Speaker 2>I can show it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

1904
01:47:27.090 --> 01:47:28.920
<v Speaker 2>It was my screensaver on my phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

1905
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:33.960
<v Speaker 2>But you see a situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another situation,</v>

1906
01:47:33.961 --> 01:47:38.961
<v Speaker 2>a people go windows jeep through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>safari and see lions.</v>

1907
01:47:39.610 --> 01:47:44.610
<v Speaker 2>So about 12 of them lying there and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go with a jeep.</v>

1908
01:47:45.810 --> 01:47:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Then suddenly comes to my kid on his</v>
<v Speaker 2>bike and older lights.</v>

1909
01:47:50.291 --> 01:47:54.150
<v Speaker 2>He him and there is to look at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

1910
01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

1911
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing.</v>

1912
01:48:00.490 --> 01:48:03.450
<v Speaker 2>It's way scarier than a werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

1913
01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Because a lion is a lion every fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>day of the week,</v>

1914
01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:09.600
<v Speaker 2>365 days a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as it's alive.</v>

1915
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:12.570
<v Speaker 2>A werewolf the werewolf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day a month,</v>

1916
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:15.800
<v Speaker 2>full moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a goddamn lie.</v>

1917
01:48:15.801 --> 01:48:18.960
<v Speaker 2>And fuck a werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of funny because that's way</v>

1918
01:48:18.961 --> 01:48:21.540
<v Speaker 2>scarier than a werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way bigger than a werewolf.</v>

1919
01:48:21.630 --> 01:48:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the face on that thing.</v>

1920
01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nature is amazing.</v>

1921
01:48:27.630 --> 01:48:32.630
<v Speaker 2>Like that is an amazing creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interest and amazing creature are able</v>

1922
01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:37.530
<v Speaker 2>to stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it when I see it.</v>

1923
01:48:37.890 --> 01:48:40.170
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>

1924
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:45.470
<v Speaker 2>what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to create an agency within my</v>

<v Speaker 2>walk through it instead off a car under</v>

1926

<v Speaker 2>that helps.</v>

1930
01:49:09.511 --> 01:49:12.240
<v Speaker 2>But it is something definitely helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way I'm going.</v>

1931
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:13.703
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1935
01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:25.740

<v Speaker 2>homeless.</v>

1936
01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where I going to help them,</v>

1937
01:49:28.230 --> 01:49:29.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1938

<v Speaker 2>We Are into university studies right now</v>

1939
01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:38.310
<v Speaker 2>dealing with that and about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>homeless,</v>

<v Speaker 2>homeless veterans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like tony robbins,</v>

1941

<v Speaker 2>participation and have say a meal,</v>

1945
01:50:02.050 --> 01:50:05.320
<v Speaker 2>but you can donate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people who are homeless,</v>

01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:06.640
<v Speaker 2>they have no money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1947
01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:11.880
<v Speaker 2>So they are able to eat and those who</v>
<v Speaker 2>come there and have altered meat meal,</v>

1948
01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:17.880
<v Speaker 2>they are not obliged to give money but</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gave it anyway and they see the</v>

1949
01:50:18.971 --> 01:50:20.200
<v Speaker 2>idea behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1950
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:22.150
<v Speaker 2>the charity go behind it.</v>

1951
01:50:22.810 --> 01:50:27.810
<v Speaker 2>And most of the times they give okay</v>
<v Speaker 2>money and it survives.</v>

1952
01:50:28.311 --> 01:50:31.420
<v Speaker 2>It's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works now I want these homeless</v>

1953
01:50:31.421 --> 01:50:35.020
<v Speaker 2>people and not only to have a soup</v>
<v Speaker 2>kitchen like that,</v>

1954
01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:40.500
<v Speaker 2>but also work on the land and providing</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables and all that for the</v>

1955
01:50:42.401 --> 01:50:46.120
<v Speaker 2>restaurant and this tribute as well in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the city.</v>

1956
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:51.190
<v Speaker 2>I think this way we could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very making them active,</v>

1957
01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:56.020
<v Speaker 2>not just donating and giving food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to get them back into,</v>

1958
01:50:56.490 --> 01:50:58.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the infrastructure,</v>

1959
01:50:58.181 --> 01:51:01.540
<v Speaker 2>the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the civilization among people.</v>

1960
01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1961
01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could just get them active and</v>

1962
01:51:05.021 --> 01:51:06.670
<v Speaker 2>give them some hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1963
01:51:06.671 --> 01:51:08.710
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost.</v>

1964
01:51:08.770 --> 01:51:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's levels of poverty and despair</v>

1965
01:51:13.570 --> 01:51:17.050
<v Speaker 2>and I think for some people that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on the edge and maybe just a little</v>

1966
01:51:17.051 --> 01:51:20.020
<v Speaker 2>bit of help or bring them back off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>edge and bring them back into</v>

1967
01:51:20.021 --> 01:51:20.854
<v Speaker 2>circulation.</v>

1968
01:51:20.890 --> 01:51:21.723
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1969
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:22.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1970
01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:26.380
<v Speaker 2>Many people become homeless over time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they weren't before and then it</v>

1971
01:51:26.381 --> 01:51:29.140
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things don't go well and I know a bunch</v>

1972
01:51:29.141 --> 01:51:31.030
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a bunch of comedian friends that</v>

1973
01:51:31.031 --> 01:51:34.540
<v Speaker 2>lived in their cars and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living on people's couches and we're</v>

1974
01:51:34.690 --> 01:51:37.270
<v Speaker 2>real close to homeless but made it</v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

1975
01:51:37.690 --> 01:51:40.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very various levels,</v>

1976
01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:44.050
<v Speaker 2>strange thing that a thing called</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization and yes,</v>

1977
01:51:44.051 --> 01:51:46.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean homeless is a very strange thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1978
01:51:46.630 --> 01:51:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't have a regular place to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

1979
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:52.210
<v Speaker 2>And that in our mind is like one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>saddest things.</v>

1980
01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1981
01:51:53.651 --> 01:51:55.890
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a place for your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1982
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:58.330
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you watch tv,</v>

1983
01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:01.810
<v Speaker 2>get online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you don't even have a facebook.</v>

1984
01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:05.560
<v Speaker 2>You're homeless and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's how a lot of us look at it.</v>

1985
01:52:05.590 --> 01:52:07.240
<v Speaker 2>We look at someone not having home.</v>

1986
01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile the homeless person or this</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who's like a backpack or some,</v>

1987
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:13.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who's like a traveler,</v>

1988
01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:18.820
<v Speaker 2>they might be way happier and healthier</v>
<v Speaker 2>than a lot of people that you see</v>

1989
01:52:18.821 --> 01:52:21.370
<v Speaker 2>trapped in these homes that are sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>there smoking cigarettes.</v>

1990
01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caring and sharing.</v>

1991
01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the thing missing.</v>

1992
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:30.250
<v Speaker 2>It certainly helped a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1993
01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1994
01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:33.960
<v Speaker 2>how to get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1995
01:52:33.970 --> 01:52:37.990
<v Speaker 2>And it's abstract now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm getting it through science.</v>

1996
01:52:37.991 --> 01:52:40.240
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did the science now.</v>

1997
01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:43.760
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do charity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great thing.</v>

1998
01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:44.970
<v Speaker 2>That is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1999
01:52:45.490 --> 01:52:46.220
<v Speaker 2>And you helping</v>

2000
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:49.430
<v Speaker 3>me right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to be helping you do anything</v>

2001
01:52:49.431 --> 01:52:53.840
<v Speaker 3>is maybe a little bit of our society is</v>
<v Speaker 3>so competitive and that that competitive</v>

2002
01:52:53.841 --> 01:52:57.320
<v Speaker 3>nature sort of alienates us from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people around us.</v>

2003
01:52:57.321 --> 01:53:01.160
<v Speaker 3>We think of them as competitors rather</v>
<v Speaker 3>than think of them as our brothers and</v>

2004
01:53:01.161 --> 01:53:02.590
<v Speaker 3>sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>

2005
01:53:03.230 --> 01:53:06.890
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lack of clarity when it comes</v>

2006
01:53:06.891 --> 01:53:09.200
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual real amount of time that we</v>

2007
01:53:09.201 --> 01:53:11.360
<v Speaker 3>have here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't really have that much time.</v>

2008
01:53:11.620 --> 01:53:15.020
<v Speaker 3>It seems like a lot of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm 49.</v>

2009
01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:17.330
<v Speaker 3>How old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifty seven.</v>

2010
01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:18.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes quick,</v>

2011
01:53:18.231 --> 01:53:19.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden it's,</v>

2012
01:53:20.210 --> 01:53:22.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm still gonna.</v>

2013
01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:27.160
<v Speaker 4>Go do fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not saying you're not going to go fast.</v>

2014
01:53:28.610 --> 01:53:32.030
<v Speaker 4>IT's going fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we broke through and what you did is</v>

2015
01:53:32.031 --> 01:53:34.830
<v Speaker 4>also very memorable bro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>

2016
01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:38.330
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to bring more consciousness and</v>

2017
01:53:38.331 --> 01:53:39.050
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got,</v>

2018
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:41.330
<v Speaker 4>we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we are really strong,</v>

2019
01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:46.630
<v Speaker 4>we protect the weak and adults who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>not able to honor a,</v>

2020
01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:48.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we give love,</v>

2021
01:53:48.620 --> 01:53:51.740
<v Speaker 4>we do it in our way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do it with,</v>

2022
01:53:51.741 --> 01:53:55.820
<v Speaker 4>by creating our awareness and by signs</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2023
01:53:55.900 --> 01:54:00.900
<v Speaker 4>and try to do now charity and we got a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hat it on w one way or another through</v>

2024
01:54:02.271 --> 01:54:04.160
<v Speaker 4>inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's another thing you're</v>

2025
01:54:04.161 --> 01:54:06.980
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're inspiring people to do something</v>

2026
01:54:06.981 --> 01:54:10.880
<v Speaker 4>and take positive action and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>oftentimes is the best thing you could</v>

2027
01:54:10.881 --> 01:54:14.030
<v Speaker 4>do rather than to help them or to give</v>
<v Speaker 4>them help.</v>

2028
01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:17.300
<v Speaker 4>You are providing them with their own</v>
<v Speaker 4>self help.</v>

2029
01:54:17.630 --> 01:54:21.640
<v Speaker 4>What I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just came from san francisco now or to</v>

2030
01:54:21.690 --> 01:54:23.210
<v Speaker 4>meet you here I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2031
01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:27.440
<v Speaker 4>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ana create me to feel feelings mutual.</v>

2032
01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:29.550
<v Speaker 4>Thanks very much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2033
01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:32.810
<v Speaker 4>I saw homeless people over there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2034
01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:37.920
<v Speaker 4>big guys and look at good at</v>

2035
01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:40.980
<v Speaker 3>a certain moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think san francisco.</v>

2036
01:54:41.010 --> 01:54:45.930
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you do something about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>San francisco is infested with</v>

2037
01:54:46.290 --> 01:54:48.900
<v Speaker 3>acceptance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have too much acceptance.</v>

2038
01:54:48.901 --> 01:54:53.640
<v Speaker 3>They've gone so far over the edge that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've made it easy for people to,</v>

2039
01:54:53.730 --> 01:54:55.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just kind of fuck off and hang out on</v>

2040
01:54:55.861 --> 01:54:59.190
<v Speaker 3>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's also the very real</v>

2041
01:54:59.191 --> 01:55:03.240
<v Speaker 3>problem of mental illness and a homeless</v>
<v Speaker 3>veterans.</v>

2042
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:04.260
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you said before,</v>

2043
01:55:04.261 --> 01:55:08.280
<v Speaker 3>that a ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a wide spectrum of reasons</v>

2044
01:55:09.130 --> 01:55:12.300
<v Speaker 3>why people become homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but san francisco is very accepting of</v>

2045
01:55:12.301 --> 01:55:13.860
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most accepting city I've ever</v>

2046
01:55:13.861 --> 01:55:15.690
<v Speaker 3>been to when it comes to homeless</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2047
01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:18.330
<v Speaker 3>But it's also one of the reasons why san</v>
<v Speaker 3>francisco is so great,</v>

2048
01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:21.240
<v Speaker 3>like they're so open minded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived there when I was a kid.</v>

2049
01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:25.230
<v Speaker 3>I lived in san francisco from age seven</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 11 and it was a different san</v>

2050
01:55:25.231 --> 01:55:30.231
<v Speaker 3>francisco because san francisco now is</v>
<v Speaker 3>all tech giants and in billionaires in</v>

2051
01:55:31.230 --> 01:55:32.010
<v Speaker 3>silicon valley.</v>

2052
01:55:32.010 --> 01:55:34.290
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did things over there down.</v>

2053
01:55:34.410 --> 01:55:36.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real estate prices are insane.</v>

2054
01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:40.320
<v Speaker 3>One of the most insane places in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world when it comes to real estate</v>

2055
01:55:40.321 --> 01:55:42.250
<v Speaker 3>prices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid it was,</v>

2056
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:46.860
<v Speaker 3>it was hippies because when I was there</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was during the Vietnam war and my</v>

2057
01:55:46.861 --> 01:55:49.950
<v Speaker 3>stepdad was a hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom was kind of a hippie and we lived</v>

2058
01:55:49.951 --> 01:55:51.720
<v Speaker 3>in a hippie neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just hippies.</v>

2059
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:53.160
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was weird.</v>

2060
01:55:53.161 --> 01:55:58.161
<v Speaker 3>It was like it was all gay and hippies</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not really like that.</v>

2061
01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:00.800
<v Speaker 3>Even the gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're kind of getting pushed out</v>

2062
01:56:00.801 --> 01:56:03.120
<v Speaker 3>in san francisco has always kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>synonymous with gay people.</v>

2063
01:56:03.121 --> 01:56:06.210
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's more tech now than anything</v>

2064
01:56:06.211 --> 01:56:11.211
<v Speaker 3>else and just extraordinary wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they still are very open minded.</v>

2065
01:56:12.211 --> 01:56:14.400
<v Speaker 3>Very progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very left wing,</v>

2066
01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:18.750
<v Speaker 3>sort of liberal kind of a town which has</v>
<v Speaker 3>its pluses and minuses,</v>

2067
01:56:19.230 --> 01:56:20.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2068
01:56:21.370 --> 01:56:22.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tolerance is excellent.</v>

2069
01:56:22.890 --> 01:56:24.910
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some,</v>

2070
01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:26.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you have that many homeless</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2071
01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.850
<v Speaker 3>like something's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that thing?</v>

2072
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:33.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be very arrogant of me without</v>

2073
01:56:33.781 --> 01:56:37.260
<v Speaker 3>any work or investigation whatsoever to</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to give some sort of an explanation</v>

2074
01:56:37.261 --> 01:56:41.110
<v Speaker 3>for what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of it's got to be connected to</v>

2075
01:56:41.111 --> 01:56:43.680
<v Speaker 3>how liberal they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just so they're so open minded.</v>

2076
01:56:43.681 --> 01:56:48.660
<v Speaker 3>they're just accepting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is old ho problem throughout</v>

2077
01:56:48.661 --> 01:56:50.230
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eh,</v>

2078
01:56:50.290 --> 01:56:53.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between the real rich and</v>

2079
01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:54.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the pool.</v>

2080
01:56:54.810 --> 01:56:58.080
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they did in baltimore for example,</v>

2081
01:56:58.081 --> 01:57:03.081
<v Speaker 3>I saw a documentary lately lately about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shame of America and they told it</v>

2082
01:57:04.381 --> 01:57:09.110
<v Speaker 3>into documentary and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now they do these programs with</v>

2083
01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:13.830
<v Speaker 3>meditation and breathing in this cooled</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they more yes,</v>

2084
01:57:13.831 --> 01:57:18.831
<v Speaker 3>in baltimore and they got a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>success that their mental state,</v>

2085
01:57:19.471 --> 01:57:24.471
<v Speaker 3>their psych is a lot better now at just</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of minding.</v>

2086
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:29.210
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we need to get to school</v>
<v Speaker 3>in schooling.</v>

2087
01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.350
<v Speaker 3>Breathing mindfulness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2088
01:57:31.351 --> 01:57:33.120
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'll be an amazing thing for kids</v>

2089
01:57:33.230 --> 01:57:35.490
<v Speaker 3>that the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>baltimore elementary school,</v>

2090
01:57:35.670 --> 01:57:39.460
<v Speaker 3>nixon's is detention for mindful</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation that hey,</v>

2091
01:57:39.530 --> 01:57:43.760
<v Speaker 3>you got some amazing and children are</v>
<v Speaker 3>very able to do that.</v>

2092
01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:45.330
<v Speaker 3>Change lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>

2093
01:57:45.331 --> 01:57:47.950
<v Speaker 3>That can truly truly changes lives</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you,</v>

2094
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:52.140
<v Speaker 3>you can give a child instead of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible thing where they feel terrible</v>

2095
01:57:52.141 --> 01:57:54.030
<v Speaker 3>about themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You give them a reset.</v>

2096
01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:56.130
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

2097
01:57:56.430 --> 01:58:01.430
<v Speaker 3>The more out of the box thinking because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the standard thInking of raising kids.</v>

2098
01:58:01.561 --> 01:58:05.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't know what schools like in</v>
<v Speaker 3>holland where you're from,</v>

2099
01:58:05.370 --> 01:58:07.740
<v Speaker 3>but here in America where I went to</v>
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

2100
01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:12.330
<v Speaker 3>it was terribly confining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you had to think a certain way.</v>

2101
01:58:12.331 --> 01:58:14.440
<v Speaker 3>You hAve to study certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2102
01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:16.830
<v Speaker 3>You weren't interested in those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2103
01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:18.780
<v Speaker 3>they made you feel like a loser.</v>

2104
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:20.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you weren't interested in math,</v>

2105
01:58:20.851 --> 01:58:24.210
<v Speaker 3>it was boring to you to sTudy certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>things they made you feel liKe you were</v>

2106
01:58:24.211 --> 01:58:26.800
<v Speaker 3>a fool and you have studies that days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2107
01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:28.740
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real,</v>

2108
01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:32.360
<v Speaker 3>most important assets of life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>happiness strengthen,</v>

2109
01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:33.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2110
01:58:34.370 --> 01:58:35.500
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2111
01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:38.970
<v Speaker 3>health will also be subjects into</v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

2112
01:58:38.971 --> 01:58:39.900
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bang,</v>

2113
01:58:40.110 --> 01:58:44.620
<v Speaker 3>and then that's creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but embracing creativity as an option</v>

2114
01:58:44.621 --> 01:58:48.510
<v Speaker 3>for you doing something with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one ever tells you that you could,</v>

2115
01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:52.120
<v Speaker 3>you could be creative for a living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could be a sculptor or a</v>

2116
01:58:52.121 --> 01:58:57.121
<v Speaker 3>painter or an artist or a musician or an</v>
<v Speaker 3>a standup comedian or an author that's</v>

2117
01:58:57.461 --> 01:59:01.450
<v Speaker 3>never offered up</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get a job,</v>

2118
01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:05.080
<v Speaker 3>work for somebody else or start your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>business and hire some people.</v>

2119
01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:07.690
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you look at the,</v>

2120
01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:12.520
<v Speaker 3>the standard places that people go once</v>
<v Speaker 3>they graduate from high school or</v>

2121
01:59:12.521 --> 01:59:14.410
<v Speaker 3>college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's usually to get a job.</v>

2122
01:59:14.410 --> 01:59:16.060
<v Speaker 3>So they push you in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this.</v>

2123
01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:17.890
<v Speaker 3>There's no individual attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You not,</v>

2124
01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:20.860
<v Speaker 3>you don't feel unique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't feel special.</v>

2125
01:59:20.861 --> 01:59:24.430
<v Speaker 3>You don't feel like you have a chance of</v>
<v Speaker 3>making outside of the system.</v>

2126
01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:27.130
<v Speaker 3>You have to fit into the system that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're presenting to you.</v>

2127
01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:29.860
<v Speaker 3>These are your college courses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is your college options.</v>

2128
01:59:29.861 --> 01:59:33.070
<v Speaker 3>You know your gpa is not so good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're going to have to go here and</v>

2129
01:59:33.071 --> 01:59:35.890
<v Speaker 3>that's going to suck because then your</v>
<v Speaker 3>job options going to be limited or you</v>

2130
01:59:35.891 --> 01:59:37.840
<v Speaker 3>can go to community college and try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring it up and you're like,</v>

2131
01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:40.330
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this fucking work,</v>

2132
01:59:40.331 --> 01:59:43.750
<v Speaker 3>and then I'm going to take a job that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to suck and it's just soul sucking</v>

2133
01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:45.610
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for some people,</v>

2134
01:59:45.611 --> 01:59:47.500
<v Speaker 3>those options seemed like a wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

2135
01:59:47.570 --> 01:59:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't offer you a lot of choices.</v>

2136
01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:55.360
<v Speaker 3>There's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not like the creative fields are</v>

2137
01:59:55.361 --> 01:59:58.330
<v Speaker 3>not embraced and I think that's a real</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem because many,</v>

2138
01:59:58.331 --> 01:59:58.811
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

2139
01:59:58.811 --> 02:00:00.680
<v Speaker 3>many kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have little tivity yes.</v>

2140
02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:05.600
<v Speaker 4>The means to express the soul's purpose</v>
<v Speaker 4>will they know when there's only seven</v>

2141
02:00:05.630 --> 02:00:09.380
<v Speaker 4>percent in the world population that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>being creative.</v>

2142
02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:15.000
<v Speaker 4>It was that real ad arrest has enthuses</v>
<v Speaker 4>system being almost,</v>

2143
02:00:16.491 --> 02:00:18.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>percent of little children and creating</v>

2144
02:00:18.910 --> 02:00:23.450
<v Speaker 4>automizing the soul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not letting the soul express</v>

2145
02:00:23.451 --> 02:00:25.130
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean soul.</v>

2146
02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:30.160
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but creativity expressing your being</v>

2147
02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:31.600
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2148
02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:34.730
<v Speaker 4>that makes it will tow beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

2149
02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:39.760
<v Speaker 4>and now it's becoming like a gray area</v>
<v Speaker 4>feeding a system and nobody knows how to</v>

2150
02:00:42.231 --> 02:00:46.850
<v Speaker 4>stop this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what this system needs to turn around</v>

2151
02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:50.570
<v Speaker 4>and begin to look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can we serve your happiness,</v>

2152
02:00:50.571 --> 02:00:53.720
<v Speaker 4>strength and health because strength,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a strength,</v>

2153
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:58.550
<v Speaker 4>a strong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy and happy people will make up a</v>

2154
02:00:58.551 --> 02:01:02.780
<v Speaker 4>great system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have gone too far.</v>

2155
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:08.090
<v Speaker 4>Now we need to go back into self</v>
<v Speaker 4>awareness and we are proving.</v>

2156
02:01:08.091 --> 02:01:12.790
<v Speaker 4>This is simply that we are able to do so</v>
<v Speaker 4>much more direct.</v>

2157
02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:15.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's just a lot of momentum</v>

2158
02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:20.040
<v Speaker 3>that's that is attached to our education</v>
<v Speaker 3>system and to our job options.</v>

2159
02:01:21.111 --> 02:01:24.620
<v Speaker 3>Once we graduated from school and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>momentum is very difficult to someone to</v>

2160
02:01:24.621 --> 02:01:28.460
<v Speaker 3>step away from because most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the time someone graduates from</v>

2161
02:01:28.461 --> 02:01:29.870
<v Speaker 3>college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early in debt,</v>

2162
02:01:30.250 --> 02:01:33.730
<v Speaker 3>you are in debt from credit cards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in debt from student loans,</v>

2163
02:01:33.731 --> 02:01:34.161
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

2164
02:01:34.161 --> 02:01:34.620
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

2165
02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:37.340
<v Speaker 3>you have to make money in order to pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>that debt off,</v>

2166
02:01:37.570 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 3>and so you immediately go right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the workforce,</v>

2167
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:44.300
<v Speaker 2>and then if you're tired after working</v>
<v Speaker 2>all day and most people find it very</v>

2168
02:01:44.301 --> 02:01:46.700
<v Speaker 2>difficult to find a way to break free</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to,</v>

2169
02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:48.860
<v Speaker 2>to pursue their real dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they are,</v>

2170
02:01:48.861 --> 02:01:52.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>songwriting or it is being an author</v>

2171

<v Speaker 2>event.</v>

2173

2180
02:02:18.621 --> 02:02:21.440
<v Speaker 2>you can get into them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you teach yoga has how,</v>

2181
02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:27.880
<v Speaker 2>say mountaineering a instructor or going</v>
<v Speaker 2>into mom to guide a mountain guiding</v>

2182

<v Speaker 2>canyoning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although studying a postman,</v>

2183
02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:40.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working in a harbor harbor ship,</v>

<v Speaker 2>habash</v>

2185
02:02:45.590 --> 02:02:48.950
<v Speaker 2>many things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wherever I go to lay my hands because I</v>

2186
02:02:49.010 --> 02:02:51.050
<v Speaker 2>didn't finish any schooling.</v>

2187

<v Speaker 2>I'm a self made man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>told them myself and learned a lot about</v>

2189
02:03:00.561 --> 02:03:03.320
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which you speak right now.</v>

2190
02:03:03.321 --> 02:03:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Anglaise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Besides of my own language.</v>

2191
02:03:05.511 --> 02:03:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And you speak those languages as well as</v>

2195
02:03:14.511 --> 02:03:15.344
<v Speaker 2>you speak?</v>
<v Speaker 2>English?</v>

2196
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:18.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she needs to practice.</v>

2197
02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:21.950
<v Speaker 2>If you do not use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lose it.</v>

2198
02:03:22.150 --> 02:03:25.280
<v Speaker 2>A of a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all in there.</v>

2199
02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:30.340
<v Speaker 2>So your primary is english and dutch or</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the books.</v>

2203
02:03:37.191 --> 02:03:41.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to people just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what about the gRammar?</v>

2204
02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:44.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine the difference between</v>

2205
02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:47.840
<v Speaker 2>take out books once you begin to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand a couple of language or you</v>

2206
02:03:47.841 --> 02:03:48.674
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2207
02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:53.420
<v Speaker 2>the logic of the languages and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes easier to take up a language.</v>

2208
02:03:53.530 --> 02:03:57.380
<v Speaker 2>What did you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I wanted to do.</v>

2209
02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:59.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you were younger right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2210
02:03:59.870 --> 02:04:00.830
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2211
02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:03.710
<v Speaker 2>Really looking at 10 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 years old.</v>

2212
02:04:03.711 --> 02:04:04.940
<v Speaker 2>And you're young man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2213
02:04:04.941 --> 02:04:09.941
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't into changing the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was into our so far out and doing</v>

2214
02:04:11.150 --> 02:04:15.710
<v Speaker 2>crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like from 17 years on,</v>

2215
02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:20.740
<v Speaker 2>I began to go into the cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being inspired by anthropologists,</v>

2216
02:04:22.650 --> 02:04:26.730
<v Speaker 2>went into tibet and talked about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline,</v>

2217
02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:28.170
<v Speaker 2>the buddhist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2218
02:04:28.171 --> 02:04:31.260
<v Speaker 2>the esoteric disciplines of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>buddhists or buddhism</v>

2219
02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:37.550
<v Speaker 2>they call cities within the yoga and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>sandy.</v>

2220
02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2221
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:42.310
<v Speaker 4>cities like cities of levitation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an old oh,</v>

2222
02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:47.320
<v Speaker 4>staying and Japan and there's some right</v>
<v Speaker 4>in moodle and all that.</v>

2223
02:04:48.810 --> 02:04:50.970
<v Speaker 4>I was very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very intrigued.</v>

2224
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:56.010
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I think they found a way to show</v>

2225
02:04:56.011 --> 02:05:01.011
<v Speaker 4>that the depth is existent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it takes years and you got to go</v>

2226
02:05:02.551 --> 02:05:04.390
<v Speaker 4>like a caveman in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2227
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:05.540
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2228
02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:10.600
<v Speaker 4>and isolate a guru or adapt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>introduce yoga practices and it's old,</v>

2229
02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:17.700
<v Speaker 4>very secretive and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and things like that.</v>

2230
02:05:17.701 --> 02:05:20.940
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was looking at internet and,</v>

2231
02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:25.320
<v Speaker 4>and why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it has got something to do with</v>

2232
02:05:25.321 --> 02:05:27.120
<v Speaker 4>my birth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was traumatic.</v>

2233
02:05:27.330 --> 02:05:32.330
<v Speaker 4>It was one of the identical twin and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was born quite too late.</v>

2234
02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Not really too late,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it made a real psychic imprint when</v>

2235
02:05:38.041 --> 02:05:42.210
<v Speaker 4>I came without too much of oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2236
02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:45.780
<v Speaker 4>fear and trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yes,</v>

2237
02:05:45.781 --> 02:05:47.130
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2238
02:05:47.131 --> 02:05:50.710
<v Speaker 4>and too cold in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a place and I was born,</v>

2239
02:05:50.730 --> 02:05:51.660
<v Speaker 4>delivered over there.</v>

2240
02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:57.080
<v Speaker 4>So I think that made a psychic imprint</v>
<v Speaker 4>which had a absolute influence in my</v>

2241
02:05:58.861 --> 02:06:00.210
<v Speaker 4>growing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2242
02:06:00.211 --> 02:06:05.211
<v Speaker 4>and then later what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always wear it had been looking into</v>

2243
02:06:05.341 --> 02:06:06.690
<v Speaker 4>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

2244
02:06:06.691 --> 02:06:08.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>disciplines say religious,</v>

2245
02:06:08.690 --> 02:06:13.020
<v Speaker 4>etc. Are always more interested tHan my</v>
<v Speaker 4>identical twin brother.</v>

2246
02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:17.730
<v Speaker 4>He's actually a normal guy working like</v>
<v Speaker 4>nine to five.</v>

2247
02:06:18.150 --> 02:06:22.290
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody could get him to play you</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some places where you can't get</v>

2248
02:06:22.291 --> 02:06:25.440
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to grow his hair like,</v>

2249
02:06:25.441 --> 02:06:26.920
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2250
02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:29.590
<v Speaker 4>not that I meet in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>

2251
02:06:29.710 --> 02:06:31.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did,</v>

2252
02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:34.860
<v Speaker 4>we did tricks because we look so much</v>
<v Speaker 4>like each other.</v>

2253
02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:39.180
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he wanted to have a say even if we</v>

2254
02:06:39.181 --> 02:06:42.000
<v Speaker 4>can trick our mother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about girlfriends?</v>

2255
02:06:42.700 --> 02:06:44.490
<v Speaker 4>Girlfriends?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2256
02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:46.050
<v Speaker 4>no comment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you,</v>

2257
02:06:46.060 --> 02:06:48.360
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you guys have the same amount of gray</v>

2258
02:06:48.361 --> 02:06:52.230
<v Speaker 4>in your beard and the whole deal stand</v>
<v Speaker 4>next to each other we say is different</v>

2259
02:06:52.231 --> 02:06:52.620
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

2260
02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:55.460
<v Speaker 4>What does he look like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's more a boulder.</v>

2261
02:06:55.461 --> 02:06:57.540
<v Speaker 4>Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am more stressed,</v>

2262
02:06:57.940 --> 02:07:00.180
<v Speaker 4>but I think more stress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2263
02:07:00.210 --> 02:07:03.120
<v Speaker 4>does he exercise a exercise?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2264
02:07:03.121 --> 02:07:07.260
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he took up a lot of what I am doing,</v>

2265
02:07:07.261 --> 02:07:09.630
<v Speaker 4>but I really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my mind,</v>

2266
02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:15.020
<v Speaker 4>I go a lot further than he is able to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's interesting that you</v>

2267
02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:20.230
<v Speaker 4>correlate that with your birth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you were born after hiM and then it</v>

2268
02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:22.820
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was some trauma involved and yes,</v>

2269
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:24.060
<v Speaker 4>some stress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2270
02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:26.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

2271
02:07:26.690 --> 02:07:30.600
<v Speaker 4>And made a psychic print.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And later my life I began to look into</v>

2272
02:07:30.601 --> 02:07:33.690
<v Speaker 4>that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time I went into this cold</v>

2273
02:07:33.691 --> 02:07:37.480
<v Speaker 4>water I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had this connection with that trauma</v>

2274
02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:43.080
<v Speaker 4>because the no other way gave me</v>
<v Speaker 4>disconnection with this deep trauma and</v>

2275
02:07:43.691 --> 02:07:48.691
<v Speaker 4>added know where it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who uga inflicted it or my mother tell</v>

2276
02:07:48.710 --> 02:07:49.780
<v Speaker 4>her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>told me later,</v>

2277
02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:52.180
<v Speaker 4>and then it made sense to me.</v>

2278
02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:53.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'S why.</v>

2279
02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:59.200
<v Speaker 4>That's why I like it in the cold and</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was born into cold,</v>

2280
02:07:59.350 --> 02:08:02.500
<v Speaker 4>almost suffocated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I do these breathing</v>

2281
02:08:02.501 --> 02:08:07.480
<v Speaker 4>exercises and feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>FInally I'm able to tap into that</v>

2282
02:08:07.481 --> 02:08:12.481
<v Speaker 4>traumatic imprint and change the</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemistry at will controlled.</v>

2283
02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:18.750
<v Speaker 4>And then I found out I was able to do so</v>
<v Speaker 4>much more because now I was able to do</v>

2284
02:08:18.971 --> 02:08:21.130
<v Speaker 4>it consciously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2285
02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:22.600
<v Speaker 4>from there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2286
02:08:22.601 --> 02:08:26.170
<v Speaker 4>I got into the television,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I got into the science and it</v>

2287
02:08:26.171 --> 02:08:31.171
<v Speaker 4>appears to be that I found also a way to</v>
<v Speaker 4>tap into what we call t trauma ptsd,</v>

2288
02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:33.760
<v Speaker 4>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fear,</v>

2289
02:08:34.340 --> 02:08:35.330
<v Speaker 4>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2290
02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:39.010
<v Speaker 4>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>auto immune diseases,</v>

2291
02:08:39.310 --> 02:08:42.280
<v Speaker 4>possibly cancer that we still got to</v>
<v Speaker 4>find out,</v>

2292
02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:45.320
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think they just got a.</v>

2293
02:08:45.770 --> 02:08:50.770
<v Speaker 4>Nature's got the solutions for us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we need to get back into nature and</v>

2294
02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:54.790
<v Speaker 4>the nature all inside.</v>

2295
02:08:55.210 --> 02:09:00.210
<v Speaker 4>we all got a faculties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the abilities to wake them up and to</v>

2296
02:09:01.451 --> 02:09:04.540
<v Speaker 4>bring them within our control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now we have shown that</v>

2297
02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:07.030
<v Speaker 4>scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>within a couple of days,</v>

2298
02:09:07.210 --> 02:09:09.850
<v Speaker 4>you are able to tap into all those</v>
<v Speaker 4>systems.</v>

2299
02:09:10.570 --> 02:09:12.850
<v Speaker 4>How far we can go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still need staff.</v>

2300
02:09:12.970 --> 02:09:16.780
<v Speaker 4>What do You think about the effect of</v>
<v Speaker 4>modern civilization traffic?</v>

2301
02:09:17.530 --> 02:09:22.450
<v Speaker 4>Just to stress and pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>environmental pollution,</v>

2302
02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:24.040
<v Speaker 4>pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the air,</v>

2303
02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:24.861
<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>WhaT,</v>

2304
02:09:24.861 --> 02:09:25.600
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind?</v>

2305
02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:29.400
<v Speaker 4>What kind of effect do you think that</v>
<v Speaker 4>has on absolutely wrong effect to</v>

2306
02:09:29.410 --> 02:09:33.670
<v Speaker 4>chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a deregulation biochemical deregulation</v>

2307
02:09:33.671 --> 02:09:35.120
<v Speaker 4>up till the dna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bam.</v>

2308
02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:38.180
<v Speaker 4>so api genetical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2309
02:09:38.350 --> 02:09:40.640
<v Speaker 4>not only genetically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

2310
02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:45.660
<v Speaker 4>during the live you talk about</v>
<v Speaker 4>epigenetics and we are able to influence</v>

2311
02:09:46.061 --> 02:09:50.550
<v Speaker 4>into the genome structure of the dna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

2312
02:09:51.070 --> 02:09:55.630
<v Speaker 4>with a existence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smog stress,</v>

2313
02:09:56.170 --> 02:10:00.610
<v Speaker 4>a negative thoughts and radiation of</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2314
02:10:00.611 --> 02:10:05.290
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know all these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we mess up the chemistry.</v>

2315
02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:10.860
<v Speaker 4>We are dealing with chemistry and we eat</v>
<v Speaker 4>food which is now not really food</v>

2316
02:10:11.471 --> 02:10:12.910
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we got a,</v>

2317
02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:18.360
<v Speaker 4>we are built with our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our systems are able to do with natural</v>

2318
02:10:18.491 --> 02:10:23.380
<v Speaker 4>food and natural tribal being like</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking care of each other.</v>

2319
02:10:23.410 --> 02:10:26.170
<v Speaker 4>Brothers and sisters like tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the way.</v>

2320
02:10:26.290 --> 02:10:31.290
<v Speaker 4>And what we do now is competition is</v>
<v Speaker 4>creating a whole lot of uncontrolled</v>

2321
02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:39.850
<v Speaker 4>getting on us all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why to server system instead of a</v>

2322
02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:44.660
<v Speaker 4>happiness strength and health care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not being served anymore.</v>

2323
02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:47.930
<v Speaker 4>Everybody running behind is there a</v>
<v Speaker 4>deadline?</v>

2324
02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:51.630
<v Speaker 4>And on top of that we get food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eh,</v>

2325
02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:54.530
<v Speaker 4>which has no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has messed with.</v>

2326
02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:59.980
<v Speaker 4>So we create a lot of difficulties for</v>
<v Speaker 4>our physiology that works back on our</v>

2327
02:11:00.561 --> 02:11:05.561
<v Speaker 4>brain because it's piece of meat inside</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's just wicking on biochemical and</v>

2328
02:11:05.871 --> 02:11:10.871
<v Speaker 4>we are messing with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what I found in nature is actually is</v>

2329
02:11:11.181 --> 02:11:15.740
<v Speaker 4>shortcut who learn to cleanse all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>older pollution,</v>

2330
02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:21.040
<v Speaker 4>creating a wrong chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>created deregulation of the dna and</v>

2331
02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:24.110
<v Speaker 4>causing the body not to be able to deal</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

2332
02:11:24.111 --> 02:11:25.550
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>disease,</v>

2333
02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:30.050
<v Speaker 4>sickness and depression and all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2334
02:11:30.530 --> 02:11:32.230
<v Speaker 4>Do you live in nAture?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like where,</v>

2335
02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:34.430
<v Speaker 4>where do you live?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in the city,</v>

2336
02:11:34.710 --> 02:11:36.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at right now.</v>

2337
02:11:36.441 --> 02:11:39.710
<v Speaker 4>I live in a little village.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little village.</v>

2338
02:11:39.711 --> 02:11:41.000
<v Speaker 4>Small town?</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

2339
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:42.590
<v Speaker 4>But stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2340
02:11:42.630 --> 02:11:44.690
<v Speaker 4>it does not matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can live anywhere.</v>

2341
02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:49.700
<v Speaker 4>You can live in New York city,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you freak out all the bam bam.</v>

2342
02:11:49.701 --> 02:11:51.190
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>

2343
02:11:51.970 --> 02:11:52.550
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2344
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:57.550
<v Speaker 4>I used to sit as a exercise on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>middle of this choir of the one most,</v>

2345
02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:00.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>traffic squares.</v>

2346
02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:04.460
<v Speaker 4>So for big city in the internet islands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is amsterdam,</v>

2347
02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:10.120
<v Speaker 4>and just meditate on the square and with</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the cars come and go and roll,</v>

2348
02:12:12.151 --> 02:12:13.350
<v Speaker 4>jude or boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

2349
02:12:13.351 --> 02:12:14.184
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

2350
02:12:14.420 --> 02:12:17.390
<v Speaker 4>And I actually had a greater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2351
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:20.300
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We used it as a.</v>

2352
02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:22.630
<v Speaker 4>An exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes sir.</v>

2353
02:12:23.330 --> 02:12:24.550
<v Speaker 4>Like A stressor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

2354
02:12:24.650 --> 02:12:26.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So all that chaos and madness.</v>

2355
02:12:26.961 --> 02:12:28.580
<v Speaker 4>You found your piece inside of all that.</v>

2356
02:12:28.700 --> 02:12:33.700
<v Speaker 4>He really are able to distance from and</v>
<v Speaker 4>witness how it works on your systems,</v>

2357
02:12:36.290 --> 02:12:41.290
<v Speaker 4>your nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the nervous system then is able to</v>

2358
02:12:41.691 --> 02:12:46.510
<v Speaker 4>deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He becomes so tranquil and the more it</v>

2359
02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:50.210
<v Speaker 4>tries to get to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are all exercises of yogis,</v>

2360
02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:53.350
<v Speaker 4>yogis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they sit with four.</v>

2361
02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:56.750
<v Speaker 4>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be around them or in the cold.</v>

2362
02:12:56.780 --> 02:13:00.290
<v Speaker 4>What I also did and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The extremes are.</v>

2363
02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:05.500
<v Speaker 4>It's extremely great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The feeling which derives if we just</v>

2364
02:13:07.250 --> 02:13:12.080
<v Speaker 4>witness and let go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interfering in the systems,</v>

2365
02:13:12.081 --> 02:13:15.650
<v Speaker 4>working with the impact of what is going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

2366
02:13:15.890 --> 02:13:20.890
<v Speaker 4>which could be stressing anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you find your own inner peAce myths,</v>

2367
02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:25.610
<v Speaker 4>all that noise and that's the way our</v>
<v Speaker 4>mInd can work.</v>

2368
02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:27.740
<v Speaker 4>That's what I do when my wife tells me</v>
<v Speaker 4>boring stories.</v>

2369
02:13:28.250 --> 02:13:30.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't even listen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just go into my center.</v>

2370
02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:31.893
<v Speaker 4>Dang.</v>

2371
02:13:36.910 --> 02:13:40.560
<v Speaker 4>I have to like pay attention to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>inflection that might indicate a</v>

2372
02:13:40.561 --> 02:13:42.060
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God dammit.</v>

2373
02:13:42.150 --> 02:13:45.870
<v Speaker 4>Let me and when that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2374
02:13:45.871 --> 02:13:46.704
<v Speaker 4>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

2375
02:13:47.070 --> 02:13:50.960
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2376
02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:53.780
<v Speaker 4>Wherever we can be very stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know you.</v>

2377
02:13:53.781 --> 02:13:57.060
<v Speaker 4>So can men date to databank?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Queue down women are way better than men</v>

2378
02:13:57.061 --> 02:13:59.460
<v Speaker 4>in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably more stressful.</v>

2379
02:13:59.810 --> 02:14:02.040
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you're banging them right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

2380
02:14:02.250 --> 02:14:04.050
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love them.</v>

2381
02:14:04.051 --> 02:14:05.030
<v Speaker 4>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the.</v>

2382
02:14:05.190 --> 02:14:07.530
<v Speaker 4>I love my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love my girlfriend.</v>

2383
02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:11.600
<v Speaker 4>Take my wife please.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Henny youngman joke.</v>

2384
02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:12.580
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2385
02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:14.480
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what else?</v>

2386
02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:17.130
<v Speaker 4>Going on a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should we wrap this up?</v>

2387
02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:18.550
<v Speaker 4>You've got to tell us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2388
02:14:18.551 --> 02:14:18.991
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2389
02:14:18.991 --> 02:14:22.110
<v Speaker 4>It's all about love and it was very</v>
<v Speaker 4>lovable to be here.</v>

2390
02:14:22.111 --> 02:14:26.100
<v Speaker 4>I feel no stress whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did buy shit,</v>

2391
02:14:26.110 --> 02:14:31.110
<v Speaker 4>but there's a whole lot more common,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think the gist of it has been</v>

2392
02:14:31.621 --> 02:14:36.540
<v Speaker 4>discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has been gotten out and it is a life so,</v>

2393
02:14:36.870 --> 02:14:38.850
<v Speaker 4>so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So beautiful.</v>

2394
02:14:39.270 --> 02:14:44.270
<v Speaker 4>I thank you for you being a big window</v>
<v Speaker 4>for so many and uh,</v>

2395
02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:45.430
<v Speaker 4>thank you for being</v>

2396
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:47.530
<v Speaker 3>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means a lot to me to,</v>

2397
02:14:47.730 --> 02:14:50.140
<v Speaker 3>to have you come back on and means a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>

2398
02:14:50.141 --> 02:14:51.840
<v Speaker 3>To be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2399
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:56.860
<v Speaker 3>to share your ideas with the world and</v>
<v Speaker 3>give you a platform.</v>

2400
02:14:57.310 --> 02:14:58.143
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2401
02:14:58.270 --> 02:15:01.030
<v Speaker 3>I think what you're doing is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>

2402
02:15:01.690 --> 02:15:05.020
<v Speaker 3>It's just incredible because it's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>effective and it's so scientifically</v>

2403
02:15:05.021 --> 02:15:07.660
<v Speaker 3>proven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also incredible because it's so</v>

2404
02:15:07.661 --> 02:15:10.930
<v Speaker 3>rare that there's not that many people</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this.</v>

2405
02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:13.720
<v Speaker 3>And if there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not talking about it the way you</v>

2406
02:15:13.721 --> 02:15:17.560
<v Speaker 3>are and they're not subjecting</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves to scientific research.</v>

2407
02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:20.380
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the more amazing things</v>

2408
02:15:20.381 --> 02:15:22.320
<v Speaker 3>about it because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2409
02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:24.190
<v Speaker 3>just like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was your friend's name?</v>

2410
02:15:24.191 --> 02:15:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Scott carney is connie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

<v Speaker 4>human beings because human</v>

2431

<v Speaker 2>being a human being should be something</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

2432
02:16:33.011 --> 02:16:36.220
<v Speaker 2>very beautiful on this beautiful planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2433
02:16:36.221 --> 02:16:37.120
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2434
02:16:37.250 --> 02:16:42.250
<v Speaker 2>I tried to express to people that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows would not be possible if people</v>

2435
02:16:43.661 --> 02:16:45.430
<v Speaker 2>weren't listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do them.</v>

2436
02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:48.220
<v Speaker 2>Nobody would be willing to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of an interesting thing about</v>

2437
02:16:48.221 --> 02:16:52.240
<v Speaker 2>podcasts because I couldn't just get you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come here and just sit and talk to me</v>

2438
02:16:52.241 --> 02:16:54.190
<v Speaker 2>and nobody else would here for hours and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

2439
02:16:54.490 --> 02:16:55.323
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2440
02:16:55.560 --> 02:17:00.560
<v Speaker 2>the actual mechanism of doing a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the act of doing a podcast allows me to</v>

2441
02:17:01.790 --> 02:17:05.860
<v Speaker 2>listen to these people like you and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these other interesting people that I so</v>

2442
02:17:05.861 --> 02:17:09.610
<v Speaker 2>lucky to get to talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I benefit from it tremendously,</v>

2443
02:17:09.790 --> 02:17:12.490
<v Speaker 2>but it wouldn't exist without other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people listening.</v>

2444
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:17.470
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that people are listening is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what makes me read these things and we</v>

2445
02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:20.080
<v Speaker 2>thank the people who are listening right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2446
02:17:20.460 --> 02:17:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from our heart.</v>

2447
02:17:22.450 --> 02:17:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2448
02:17:23.980 --> 02:17:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't for them like that does.</v>

2449
02:17:26.321 --> 02:17:27.880
<v Speaker 2>That sounds so cliche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2450
02:17:27.881 --> 02:17:29.200
<v Speaker 2>if it wasn't for you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't do it,</v>

2451
02:17:29.470 --> 02:17:31.600
<v Speaker 2>but there would be no reason there'd be</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2452
02:17:31.620 --> 02:17:33.540
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be no motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

2453
02:17:33.670 --> 02:17:37.840
<v Speaker 2>if it wasn't for people listening that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be no show,</v>

2454
02:17:38.050 --> 02:17:39.850
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never have met.</v>

2455
02:17:39.851 --> 02:17:42.700
<v Speaker 2>You have never met all the extraordinary</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I've met.</v>

2456
02:17:43.330 --> 02:17:48.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm very eager to see what this is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do and because the last time I met</v>

02:19:56.201 --> 02:20:01.201

<v Speaker 2>the prehistoric where you don't agree at</v>

2508
02:20:03.720 --> 02:20:05.950
<v Speaker 2>a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:11.720
<v Speaker 2>What do you think scientists would that</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now we have a ability to</v>

2511
02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:18.520
<v Speaker 2>consciously choose a woman and in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>world it's not about going and</v>

2512
02:20:20.151 --> 02:20:25.151
<v Speaker 2>spreadsheet seed everywhere now it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>be with one woman consciously,</v>

2515
02:20:28.791 --> 02:20:32.030
<v Speaker 2>What he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's sort of trying to explain the,</v>

2516
02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:36.590
<v Speaker 2>the yes,</v>

2517
02:20:36.591 --> 02:20:41.060
<v Speaker 2>think he's very intelligent and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he does is great work because he</v>

2518
02:20:41.061 --> 02:20:43.640
<v Speaker 2>wakes up a whole lot of.</v>

2519
02:20:43.641 --> 02:20:44.900

<v Speaker 2>it's very controversial,</v>

2520
02:20:44.901 --> 02:20:49.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's very rooted in science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got this story with this cat.</v>

2521
02:20:49.940 --> 02:20:50.721
