<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.890
<v Speaker 1>your childhood was fucking completely bizarre.</v>

3
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean my childhood was bizarre on paper,</v>

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't bizarre in front of the whole world,</v>

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.331
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

6
00:00:11.331 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>And you became a fucking superstar when you were a little kid.</v>

7
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.021
<v Speaker 1>You're 40 now,</v>

8
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.110
<v Speaker 1>District for.</v>

10
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm 43.</v>

12
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>So when I saw the champ,</v>

13
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I think I was seven.</v>

14
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>What would you like for?</v>

15
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

16
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.861
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

17
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I was seven.</v>

18
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>So you were 10 and the champ.</v>

19
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.783
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

20
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

22
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.370
<v Speaker 1>my time,</v>

23
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Ron,</v>

24
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>but either way.</v>

25
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.481
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

26
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>whatever I was seven or 10,</v>

27
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:34.680
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking crying like a baby.</v>

28
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>And you were even younger than me then.</v>

29
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>So when I was a little kid,</v>

30
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>when I was like going through life,</v>

31
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out,</v>

32
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:41.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>what my parents were breaking,</v>

34
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to figure out like fuck,</v>

35
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>what is life all about?</v>

36
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>You were fucking famous in front of the world.</v>

37
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Like I couldn't imagine that point in my life being famous.</v>

38
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>That must have been so strange to develop in that.</v>

39
00:00:58.351 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>But you're so normal.</v>

40
00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

41
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing that's interesting about like growing up famous,</v>

42
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>because I became famous when I was like seven,</v>

43
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>so I don't have any memory of life before fame.</v>

44
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.083
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

45
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.090
<v Speaker 1>So when that happens and you're forming and you're getting programmed and you're</v>

46
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 1>getting created as a child,</v>

47
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

49
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>that's what becomes normal for you.</v>

50
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't have any frame of reference like I wasn't 30 and all of a sudden</v>

51
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Bam became famous and I had 30 years of history of normal life.</v>

52
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 1>So fame is normal for me.</v>

53
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>So because it's normal,</v>

54
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>that means kind of,</v>

55
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not special because what's normal is normal.</v>

56
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.433
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

57
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.303
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of,</v>

58
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I think at different unique thing about being a child actor.</v>

59
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.023
<v Speaker 1>Like I wasn't.</v>

60
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.100
<v Speaker 1>I saw drew barrymore last night.</v>

61
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I went to never heard anybody put it that way before I went to her premier last</v>

62
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.710
<v Speaker 1>night and she,</v>

63
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.130
<v Speaker 1>she's kind of done the same thing and um,</v>

64
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>her new movie and gave her a big hug and kiss.</v>

65
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen her in 20 years to grab her ass and not just cheat girl though</v>

66
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>you get rid of case.</v>

67
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I've known her since I felt good.</v>

68
00:01:58.951 --> 00:01:59.201
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

69
00:01:59.201 --> 00:01:59.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm 12,</v>

70
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm on felt good.</v>

71
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:01.614
<v Speaker 1>She was eight.</v>

72
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.920
<v Speaker 1>We would dance Tom Green.</v>

73
00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:04.591
<v Speaker 1>That got that.</v>

74
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>You could get that to kid.</v>

75
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 1>So drew the same thing.</v>

76
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>It's been a few of us that have gone through that,</v>

77
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.513
<v Speaker 1>like not many.</v>

78
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.191
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

79
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:11.921
<v Speaker 1>very few.</v>

80
00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:12.754
<v Speaker 1>I could count on a hand.</v>

81
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

82
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>The percentage of people who go through that and get Lindsay Lohan or like,</v>

83
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like 95,</v>

84
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

85
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>More.</v>

87
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.680
<v Speaker 1>More than maybe.</v>

88
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 1>What do you think was the difference with you?</v>

89
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.423
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

90
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference?</v>

91
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

92
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:29.970
<v Speaker 1>I quit the partying thing when I was young and I didn't continue it.</v>

93
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Like I think some people do and you know,</v>

94
00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I had my few wildly years between 16 and 20,</v>

95
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

96
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>I always kept my kind of stuff quiet and I kind of kept it under the radar and</v>

97
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't really public about it.</v>

99
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>And then I met that was because there was no TMZ.</v>

100
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>There's no internet,</v>

101
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>no Internet sun and keep it on the dl rotors here making it rain.</v>

102
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever wonder when I was 20 I met Andrea and that just kinda changed my</v>

103
00:02:58.801 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>life because I was,</v>

104
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I was a dad at 22.</v>

105
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.361
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

106
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big part of it,</v>

107
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

108

364
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.280

379
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:41.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

380
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:42.570
<v Speaker 1>this is the time.</v>

381
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:44.210

<v Speaker 1>biggest planet starting the universe,</v>

383
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.860

384
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

385
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.270
<v Speaker 1>we're hanging out in his trailer and um,</v>

386
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

387
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 1>just hanging out really nice quiet,</v>

388
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:53.364
<v Speaker 1>shy guy.</v>

389
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.900
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm like 16,</v>

390
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:55.351
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>

391
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:55.591
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

392
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:55.921
<v Speaker 1>Michael,</v>

393
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>what's know,</v>

394
00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:00.150
<v Speaker 1>how did you make it from a kid actor to an adult like this,</v>

395
00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:00.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

396
00:10:00.301 --> 00:10:01.260
<v Speaker 1>how did you survive?</v>

397
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Because I was kind of in the middle of transitioning from a kid to an adult.</v>

398
00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

399
00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:06.270
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

400
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 1>the trick was being inspired ricky,</v>

401
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.280
<v Speaker 1>because I had to be inspired to keep it up.</v>

402
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.610
<v Speaker 1>And I had to find stuff that I wanted to work on and wanting to do.</v>

403
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.420
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

404
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:15.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

406
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I kind of took that advice to heart,</v>

407
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

408
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.051
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

409
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 1>nothing ever inappropriate.</v>

410
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.150
<v Speaker 1>And he started kissing her nipples.</v>

411
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Nothing inappropriate rap with me or that I know of.</v>

412
00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>

413
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>
