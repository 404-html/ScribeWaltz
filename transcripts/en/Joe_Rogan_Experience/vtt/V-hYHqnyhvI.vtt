1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Three two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Scharmer's here,</v>

3
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:05.334
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've been talking about silly </v>

4
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:09.910
<v Speaker 1>people for the past 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.973
<v Speaker 1>we had to get warmed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fill the list is endless to get warmed </v>

6
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:13.944
<v Speaker 1>up with body doubles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fair as Hillary Hillary had her </v>

7
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>about yet flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earthers um,</v>

8
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>forests aren't real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they're saying?</v>

9
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:21.264
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The flat earthers we're going to talk </v>

10
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Speaker 1>about the flat earthers for one reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.953
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I wanted to bring this up</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because I think there's a lot of </v>

12
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:32.940
<v Speaker 1>folks out there that are super gullible </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think they're being trolled.</v>

13
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.690
<v Speaker 1>I think they're being trolled by people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who put together these,</v>

14
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.573
<v Speaker 1>it's one of two options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either they're being trolled by people </v>

15
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.213
<v Speaker 1>who put together these elaborate </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments for something that they don't </v>

16
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>believe because they're just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make money off of youtube videos,</v>

17
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>which is entirely possible.</v>

18
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.763
<v Speaker 1>And this needs to be thought of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really needs to be considered </v>

19
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.703
<v Speaker 1>because lou youtube videos can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely lucrative if you can get a </v>

20
00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:56.844
<v Speaker 1>youtube video with millions of hits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these videos on all sorts of </v>

21
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>different conspiracies and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different crazy things can generate that</v>

22
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>kind of volume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're making real money,</v>

23
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.820
<v Speaker 1>pennies on the dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's millions,</v>

24
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yep.</v>

25
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.443
<v Speaker 1>It starts becoming real money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts and if you do a bunch of them </v>

26
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do them on a regular basis,</v>

27
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes like what they do.</v>

28
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.123
<v Speaker 1>They create these silly videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people who just don't have the time </v>

29
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.473
<v Speaker 1>or the inclination to actually read </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific papers and articles and </v>

30
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:26.964
<v Speaker 1>journals and all these different things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that explain how we've known for a long </v>

31
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.080
<v Speaker 1>time that the earth is right,</v>

32
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.820
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a myth that a Columbus proved that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth is not flat,</v>

34
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Speaker 2>that it's round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

35
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.600
<v Speaker 2>the ancients knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Greeks knew,</v>

36
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:42.434
<v Speaker 2>Columbus knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knew a little bit then that it </v>

37
00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:49.931
<v Speaker 2>was round and there's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>depictions on clay.</v>

38
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drew it in clay.</v>

39
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 2>They drew all the planets as circles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

40
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 2>They knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

41
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's some obvious simple ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody could do.</v>

42
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:01.250
<v Speaker 2>If you see an eclipse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lunar eclipse,</v>

43
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:03.500
<v Speaker 2>you can see the Earth's shadow on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>

44
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:05.420
<v Speaker 2>It's round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

45
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

46
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.230
<v Speaker 2>if you're high enough and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ships are sailing out,</v>

47
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:10.064
<v Speaker 2>you can see the mass does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last thing you would see as the </v>

48
00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:14.570
<v Speaker 2>whole drops over the horizon first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly.</v>

49
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.913
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's things like that that we know </v>

50
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:18.350
<v Speaker 2>the earth is round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

51
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.050
<v Speaker 2>you traveled around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come back to where you started.</v>

52
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

53
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.740
<v Speaker 2>now their explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flat earthers is that,</v>

54
00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:26.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's round like a pizza,</v>

55
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.860
<v Speaker 2>but around flat pizza and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>continents are on the one flat face side</v>

56
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.250
<v Speaker 2>up and that the satellites are up there </v>
<v Speaker 2>going around.</v>

57
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:34.881
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

58
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:35.714
<v Speaker 2>but the satellite photos don't show all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the continents in one picture because </v>

59
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.420
<v Speaker 2>some of them are on the other side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the globe.</v>

60
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:42.620
<v Speaker 2>So that refutes that.</v>

61
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

62
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>but they think that satellites are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually in planes.</v>

63
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.020
<v Speaker 1>They're in planes and Ortho over that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are just circling around.</v>

64
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:53.480
<v Speaker 1>There's no actual satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even believe in satellite.</v>

65
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.480
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

66
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.291
<v Speaker 2>lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

67
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:56.900
<v Speaker 2>So back to your original comment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

68
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 2>some of these recent ones are so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't help but think,</v>

69
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.443
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe that they're just </v>

70
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 2>yanking our chain for maybe financial </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>

71
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 2>But that does get to the question I </v>
<v Speaker 2>always get,</v>

72
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 2>which is do these people really believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

73
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:10.024
<v Speaker 2>The cult leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that make a extraordinary </v>

74
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 2>claims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they just making this stuff up?</v>

75
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people make shit up all the time.</v>

76
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 2>It's called fiction fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

77
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>or do they really believe it or they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

78
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 2>true believers and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to tell.</v>

79
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get inside people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

80
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 2>the old flat earthers in the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>

81
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 2>I think they really did believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

82
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't much money to be made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.693
<v Speaker 2>on those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned the Alfred Russell Wallace </v>

84
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 2>who was the co discover of natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection with Darwin.</v>

85
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.903
<v Speaker 2>I wrote my dissertation on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And wrote a biography of him and he was </v>

86
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:39.814
<v Speaker 2>quite the colorful character who was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>open minded to new ideas that he was </v>

87
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:43.894
<v Speaker 2>also gullible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So open minded enough to see this </v>

88
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 2>radical new theory of the evolution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life by natural selection that's good.</v>

89
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Pioneered other fields like biogeography</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

90
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 2>But he also was really into spiritualism</v>
<v Speaker 2>and phrenology,</v>

91
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.450
<v Speaker 2>seances handling all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he encountered an ad and one of</v>

92
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 2>the natural history magazines for this </v>
<v Speaker 2>500 pound bet,</v>

93
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 2>if anybody could prove the earth is </v>
<v Speaker 2>round.</v>

94
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 2>So he devised a test and he went down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bedford canal,</v>

95
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 2>which is a long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight,</v>

96
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 2>like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 kilometers long.</v>

97
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:19.444
<v Speaker 2>You can see the whole distance and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you put these little sticks in the </v>

98
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 2>ground with markers on them and you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>a little telescope like,</v>

99
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:26.614
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

100
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surveyors scope and you line it up,</v>

101
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 2>you can see that it bends.</v>

102
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 2>So at each point that stick is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 2>three meters above the ground at each </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

104
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.903
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can see that it's dropped down </v>

105
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 2>in the last one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's bent.</v>

106
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 2>So he won the bet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't get paid,</v>

107
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:43.930
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because these people are cranks.</v>

108
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.681
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

109
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:48.220
<v Speaker 2>so we had to take him to court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ended up costing him about 15 years</v>

110
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 2>of his career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

111
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 2>just wasting time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

112
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 2>writing letters and getting court dates </v>
<v Speaker 2>and suing this guy and,</v>

113
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the try to win the bet.</v>

114
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just try to win the bet.</v>

115
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course,</v>

116
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.430
<v Speaker 2>what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get caught up emotionally,</v>

117
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:01.264
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to let this bastard get </v>

118
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:03.120
<v Speaker 2>away with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

119
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.840
<v Speaker 2>you should have just cut his losses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh.</v>

120
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:05.674
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I found these letters that this guy </v>

121
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:09.880
<v Speaker 2>wrote to the national degree or the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

122
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 2>the Royal Geographical Society about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

123
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 2>Alfred Russell Wallace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

124
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 2>you have one member of your society that</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be,</v>

125
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a quack and a crank and,</v>

126
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:21.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wrote letters to the Wallace,</v>

127
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:22.900
<v Speaker 2>his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

128
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:23.734
<v Speaker 2>you better not sleep in your bed at </v>
<v Speaker 2>night quietly because I'm coming to get </v>

129
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:27.360
<v Speaker 2>you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

130
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.611
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

131
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:28.450
<v Speaker 2>like death threats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

132
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

133
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.071
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

134
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:30.904
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always questionable to deal with </v>

135
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:34.300
<v Speaker 2>cranks because some of them are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

136
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally deranged.</v>

137
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.313
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they can attach themselves to </v>

138
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:41.490
<v Speaker 3>someone like Wallace or Darwin or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody else.</v>

139
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.343
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can somehow or another connect </v>

140
00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:45.960
<v Speaker 3>yourself to them and some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>

141
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.823
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of legitimizes you at least in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a way because that person's giving you </v>

142
00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:50.514
<v Speaker 3>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that person is engaging you and it </v>

143
00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:53.064
<v Speaker 3>elevates your standing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then whenever two people are </v>

144
00:05:54.691 --> 00:05:55.524
<v Speaker 3>arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a certain amount of people are going to </v>

145
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 3>choose sides.</v>

146
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.263
<v Speaker 2>They're just getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if what you're saying doesn't make </v>

147
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:02.054
<v Speaker 2>any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a gang of people </v>

148
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:03.621
<v Speaker 2>that go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

149
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:04.454
<v Speaker 2>what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're going to join in and people </v>

150
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love to be on a team.</v>

151
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.093
<v Speaker 2>They love to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to be on team Wallace or team </v>

152
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 2>crank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

153
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 2>That's a natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's also why people like a lot of</v>

154
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:17.230
<v Speaker 2>the creation is Wanda debate dawkins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

155
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.163
<v Speaker 2>Because he's the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the number one top best known </v>

156
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 2>biological scientists in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly for since Darwin himself.</v>

157
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 2>If I can get him onstage and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dawkins likes to say,</v>

158
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 2>this will look better on your resume </v>
<v Speaker 2>than mine,</v>

159
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:32.360
<v Speaker 2>so I'll pass and he doesn't need the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

160
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:34.860
<v Speaker 2>So well in the contrary argument or the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

161
00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:35.694
<v Speaker 2>the other position is so many people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are actual scientists want to debate </v>

162
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 2>depok oh well yes.</v>

163
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.223
<v Speaker 2>And I have debated the puck and now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's back to the question is does </v>

164
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:47.210
<v Speaker 2>he really believe it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause people,</v>

165
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.290
<v Speaker 2>most skeptics and atheists thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

166
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.450
<v Speaker 2>pucks just a fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a con man selling snake oil.</v>

167
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known him now for a number of years</v>

168
00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 2>and the last year I've spent a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time with them.</v>

169
00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.773
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I know he believes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely what he says is because he's </v>

170
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:04.510
<v Speaker 2>always working on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

171
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.521
<v Speaker 2>privately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

172
00:07:05.521 --> 00:07:07.360
<v Speaker 2>if we're at lunch or dinner or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

173
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I got half a dozen emails just the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>two days from dupont.</v>

174
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.103
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not for public consumption is not </v>

175
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not debating,</v>

176
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.970
<v Speaker 2>he's just trying to convince me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

177
00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's right.</v>

178
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does he try and convince you?</v>

179
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a about consciousness here.</v>

180
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you do it in his voice please?</v>

181
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.570
<v Speaker 2>A quote from Vince Donta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the body is in the mind,</v>

182
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.960
<v Speaker 2>but not all of the mind is in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Swami Rama.</v>

183
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 2>Well as long as he's quoting Swami Rama </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know.</v>

184
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.483
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

185
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.640
<v Speaker 2>so he sends me these not because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a crank.</v>

186
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.011
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

187
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:47.090
<v Speaker 2>he wants to convince me that his </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldview is,</v>

188
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.403
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different from mine but better or I </v>

189
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:52.340
<v Speaker 2>should have a more open mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

190
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:53.174
<v Speaker 2>that's a bizarre quote and that quote </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be interpreted a bunch of different </v>

191
00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 2>ways and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

192
00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:00.170
<v Speaker 2>one could say that we really don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>where consciousness is.</v>

193
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we need that exists in the mind.</v>

194
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we do know is if you blow someone's</v>

195
00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 2>brains out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they no longer exhibit any behavior that</v>

196
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:11.600
<v Speaker 2>you could recognize as being conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

197
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

198
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.070
<v Speaker 2>in my debates with the Puck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make the point,</v>

199
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he points out as you just did,</v>

200
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.640
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is the so called heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem and not how neurons fire.</v>

201
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.473
<v Speaker 2>We know how that works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the experience you have of looking </v>

202
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:26.384
<v Speaker 2>at me and vice versa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that derive from just a </v>

203
00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 2>dopamine going across synapses or </v>
<v Speaker 2>norepinephrine going across synapses?</v>

204
00:08:34.191 --> 00:08:35.024
<v Speaker 2>It's just electric meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you get electric meet to have </v>

205
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 2>this experience where happy as he likes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

206
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:41.450
<v Speaker 2>where's the red?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I open your skull up,</v>

207
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:43.580
<v Speaker 2>there's no red in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no room in there.</v>

208
00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 2>It's just neurons firing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how does that happen?</v>

209
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is the hard problem.</v>

210
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:49.740
<v Speaker 2>No one knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

211
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that we don't nothing,</v>

212
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.313
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have some ideas about how it works </v>

213
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is just one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones that either will never be resolved,</v>

214
00:08:58.381 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 2>like free will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>determinism,</v>

215
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

216
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:01.254
<v Speaker 2>we live in a determined universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can we have free will if that's </v>

217
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

218
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:04.531
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The words,</v>

219
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:06.210
<v Speaker 2>the language that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

220
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:07.044
<v Speaker 2>there's certain restrictions on our </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognition of how we think about the </v>

221
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:12.510
<v Speaker 2>world and that's very much influenced by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the words we use.</v>

222
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:15.610
<v Speaker 2>So that could be one of those mysterion </v>
<v Speaker 2>mysteries that you know,</v>

223
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.440
<v Speaker 2>can't be solved simply by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that we're not smart enough,</v>

224
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 2>that just the limitations of how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive the world.</v>

225
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just,</v>

226
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 2>so there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to look at like this,</v>

228
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:34.550
<v Speaker 2>there was a big survey of professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophers done about three years ago,</v>

229
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:36.600
<v Speaker 2>about 2,600</v>
<v Speaker 2>phd,</v>

230
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 2>either professors or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or doctoral students in philosophy.</v>

231
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:43.740
<v Speaker 2>What is your position on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're like 25 different debates in</v>

232
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:45.420
<v Speaker 2>philosophy and like free will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Determinism,</v>

233
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:46.254
<v Speaker 2>it was roughly equally split between </v>
<v Speaker 2>determinist and compatible is like Dan </v>

234
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.263
<v Speaker 2>Dennett is a compatiblist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris is a determinist and a small </v>

235
00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:56.010
<v Speaker 2>percentage of a libertarian free will.</v>

236
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 2>What are the compatiblist compatiblist </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

237
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except the,</v>

238
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:00.443
<v Speaker 2>the premise that the universe is </v>
<v Speaker 2>determined governed by laws of nature </v>

239
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:04.830
<v Speaker 2>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

240
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:05.723
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we make free choices within the causal </v>

241
00:10:07.891 --> 00:10:09.030
<v Speaker 2>net of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

242
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm making choices like I chose to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out here.</v>

243
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was a choice.</v>

244
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:14.641
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

245
00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:18.090
<v Speaker 2>the universe is determined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my behavior,</v>

246
00:10:18.091 --> 00:10:22.140
<v Speaker 2>my actions might volitional choices </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the net.</v>

247
00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.650
<v Speaker 2>The causal net is part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

248
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:26.484
<v Speaker 2>and in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't know all the variables so it </v>

249
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:29.154
<v Speaker 2>feels like you're making free choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you are in essence making free </v>

250
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:36.660
<v Speaker 2>choices because it feels free even if </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you don't know all the determining</v>

251
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:37.494
<v Speaker 2>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the compatiblist is something like </v>

252
00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just different versions of it.</v>

253
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:40.980
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

254
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.341
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

255
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 2>it makes a good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Degrees of freedom.</v>

256
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.410
<v Speaker 2>We have this idea of degrees of freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>and engineering.</v>

257
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.483
<v Speaker 2>Certain systems are more complex or less</v>
<v Speaker 2>complex in certain systems have more </v>

258
00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:54.210
<v Speaker 2>variation than others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you think of degrees of freedom,</v>

259
00:10:54.211 --> 00:10:56.370
<v Speaker 2>like an insect has very few degrees of </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom,</v>

260
00:10:56.371 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 2>it's almost entirely instinctively </v>
<v Speaker 2>driven.</v>

261
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.710
<v Speaker 2>Small number of neurons and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

262
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.573
<v Speaker 2>maybe a rat has more degrees of freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>than an insect that dog more than a rat </v>

263
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.790
<v Speaker 2>primate more than a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>US more than the other primates.</v>

264
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.550
<v Speaker 2>It just how many choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many variations.</v>

265
00:11:11.551 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 2>So you can come up here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go this way,</v>

266
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:13.801
<v Speaker 2>this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this way,</v>

267
00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:15.420
<v Speaker 2>this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this way with the human,</v>

268
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:17.400
<v Speaker 2>it's not clear which way they're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go with the Rad.</v>

269
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:19.050
<v Speaker 2>It's more predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll take this,</v>

270
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.393
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this maze or that maze because the food </v>

271
00:11:22.471 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 2>is over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

272
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.170
<v Speaker 2>So as dented argues that we're free </v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

273
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.260
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

274
00:11:30.261 --> 00:11:31.650
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mouse or the dog,</v>

275
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:32.760
<v Speaker 2>we have more choices.</v>

276
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.810
<v Speaker 2>And even within human populations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the law has already accommodated this.</v>

277
00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:37.950
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

278
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:40.380
<v Speaker 2>first degree murder is different than </v>
<v Speaker 2>second degree murder.</v>

279
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.233
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

280
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.083
<v Speaker 2>w w what is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To what extent you intended to kill the </v>

281
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:49.260
<v Speaker 2>person you planned it out versus you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of control.</v>

282
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you inflict grotto,</v>

283
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:53.340
<v Speaker 2>you Katra partner in bed with somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

284
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 2>you lost your temper ban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

285
00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:57.550
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you wouldn't normally do that.</v>

286
00:11:57.551 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 2>So we think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

287
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.680
<v Speaker 2>violent aggressiveness or drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction,</v>

288
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.090
<v Speaker 2>alcohol addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tumor on the brain.</v>

289
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:05.111
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

290
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:05.944
<v Speaker 2>the famous case of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the University of Texas Bell Tower </v>

291
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:10.600
<v Speaker 2>shooter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

292
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:11.201
<v Speaker 2>Whitman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

293
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:13.360
<v Speaker 2>you left that note.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

294
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.243
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lately I've been feeling not normal and </v>

295
00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:17.344
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm feeling quite violent and I'm going </v>

296
00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:24.130
<v Speaker 2>to do some bad shit today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I'm dead do an autopsy.</v>

297
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:24.964
<v Speaker 2>So he went out and killed his mother and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he went to the bell tower and </v>

298
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:28.510
<v Speaker 2>killed 19 people or whatever it was.</v>

299
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 2>They did an autopsy shirt off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a tumor.</v>

300
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it was next to the hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we would,</v>

301
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.373
<v Speaker 2>we would recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that guy had fewer degrees of </v>

302
00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:38.840
<v Speaker 2>freedom than you and I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

303
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.480
<v Speaker 2>it's not that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse it,</v>

304
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:41.590
<v Speaker 2>we just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

305
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 2>he had a tumor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

306
00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:44.254
<v Speaker 2>so that's the compatiblist argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll sand someone like Samara </v>

307
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.600
<v Speaker 2>determinist would say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

308
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:50.620
<v Speaker 2>it's all tumors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

309
00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:51.454
<v Speaker 2>it's all determined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just using different causal </v>

310
00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:54.394
<v Speaker 2>vectors to describe the behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are more obvious than </v>

311
00:12:57.221 --> 00:13:01.120
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the best argument on that case I know</v>

312
00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:05.860
<v Speaker 2>of is from a guy named Adrian Raine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a psychiatrist and neuroscientists</v>

313
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.330
<v Speaker 2>who was the first to scan the brains of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a serial killers in prison.</v>

314
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:15.870
<v Speaker 2>So he would take this portable fm Ri </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain scanner to these prisons and these</v>

315
00:13:16.031 --> 00:13:16.840
<v Speaker 2>guys have nothing to do.</v>

316
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.970
<v Speaker 2>So they're happy to participate as </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjects.</v>

317
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:20.283
<v Speaker 2>And he would scan their brains and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>found that they have very little self </v>

318
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.653
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is associated with the prefrontal </v>

319
00:13:26.351 --> 00:13:29.860
<v Speaker 2>cortex and their prefrontal cortex is </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty quiet,</v>

320
00:13:29.861 --> 00:13:32.560
<v Speaker 2>pretty undeveloped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inactive.</v>

321
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.550
<v Speaker 2>So you have all these impulses that </v>
<v Speaker 2>bubble up and there's no break.</v>

322
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.460
<v Speaker 2>There's no governor on the system to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it in check.</v>

323
00:13:39.461 --> 00:13:40.294
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you and I would count to 10 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk out of the room if we're getting </v>

324
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:43.620
<v Speaker 2>heated up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

325
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.820
<v Speaker 2>their lucky more likely to just reach </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

326
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.410
<v Speaker 2>punch you if you say something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

327
00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:49.270
<v Speaker 2>like something like that lack of self </v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

328
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.730
<v Speaker 2>So he argues that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

329
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.110
<v Speaker 2>that if somebody has a tumor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious you can see it.</v>

330
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.440
<v Speaker 2>But what if somebody just has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crappiest background?</v>

331
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.520
<v Speaker 2>You can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

332
00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:02.590
<v Speaker 2>raised in a broken home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>single mom,</v>

333
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:05.980
<v Speaker 2>drug addictions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gang related inner city,</v>

334
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.770
<v Speaker 2>crappy diets dropped on their head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so on.</v>

335
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:13.150
<v Speaker 2>And he gives an example of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a young man named Donta page and African</v>

336
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.983
<v Speaker 2>American who was convicted for raping </v>
<v Speaker 2>and killing a woman and he's on death </v>

337
00:14:17.621 --> 00:14:20.710
<v Speaker 2>row or I think he got life in prison in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a case.</v>

338
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

339
00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:24.430
<v Speaker 2>so he describes spends pages in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

340
00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:27.340
<v Speaker 2>the anatomy of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this guy's background.</v>

341
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:28.174
<v Speaker 2>And it's the worst background you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could possibly imagine that surely </v>

342
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:31.774
<v Speaker 2>has affects on his brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's not a tumor you can't scan </v>

343
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:35.561
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

344
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:36.490
<v Speaker 2>there's a tumor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

345
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.473
<v Speaker 2>he's got a tumor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's had a background that would </v>

346
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:42.430
<v Speaker 2>surely be different than the background </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I have had.</v>

347
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.540
<v Speaker 2>And therefore he had fewer choices in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his actions that you and I would have.</v>

348
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.770
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

349
00:14:47.771 --> 00:14:49.420
<v Speaker 2>the law would deal with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

350
00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:50.470
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but see,</v>

351
00:14:50.471 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 2>someone like Dan Dennett would say,</v>

352
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.873
<v Speaker 3>well that those are degrees of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had fewer choices than the person </v>

353
00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:59.720
<v Speaker 3>that didn't have the awful background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's one of these,</v>

354
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 3>this is one of those things where it </v>
<v Speaker 3>depends what you mean by these words,</v>

355
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.910
<v Speaker 3>like decrees of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>volition,</v>

356
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:09.110
<v Speaker 3>choice actions versus just more of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>physics,</v>

357
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:12.710
<v Speaker 3>engineering billiard table type of </v>
<v Speaker 3>causal model.</v>

358
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.913
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a really complex question and </v>

359
00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:17.264
<v Speaker 3>subject and one that people battle with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even when you're faced with the </v>

360
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:23.700
<v Speaker 3>determinism argument like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

361
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.553
<v Speaker 3>if you take in the logic of determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you are the product of your </v>

362
00:15:27.651 --> 00:15:29.060
<v Speaker 3>genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your environment,</v>

363
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:29.894
<v Speaker 3>of all your life experiences have all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different things and they are </v>

364
00:15:31.911 --> 00:15:35.390
<v Speaker 3>what's dictating all your choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even when you're making a choice,</v>

365
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.493
<v Speaker 3>the choice you're making is based on all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the data that you've taken in your </v>

366
00:15:38.961 --> 00:15:39.794
<v Speaker 3>entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you in fact have freewill at that </v>

367
00:15:42.411 --> 00:15:46.820
<v Speaker 3>moment or has it all been sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>determined by all these experiences?</v>

368
00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.710
<v Speaker 3>And it's so hard to argue because </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's life is different.</v>

369
00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:53.840
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's take on things are </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

370
00:15:53.841 --> 00:15:57.420
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could have the exact same experience</v>

371
00:15:57.421 --> 00:15:58.254
<v Speaker 3>as I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your take from it might be very </v>

372
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:03.140
<v Speaker 3>different than mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be a person meditates.</v>

373
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.990
<v Speaker 3>So you might be really into mindfulness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and really into uh,</v>

374
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.873
<v Speaker 3>sitting down and trying to objectively </v>
<v Speaker 3>analyze all your thoughts and your </v>

375
00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:12.044
<v Speaker 3>reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might come out with a completely </v>

376
00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:13.964
<v Speaker 3>different decision based on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is it still determinism if all of a </v>

377
00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:20.450
<v Speaker 3>sudden you start practicing meditation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you change your behavior?</v>

378
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.580
<v Speaker 3>Is that determinism?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is that I would love,</v>

379
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I would love that more into the category</v>
<v Speaker 3>of freedom.</v>

380
00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:26.330
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

381
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.163
<v Speaker 3>you may become self aware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I have a violent temper and I </v>

382
00:16:29.811 --> 00:16:32.210
<v Speaker 3>really need to do something about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

383
00:16:32.211 --> 00:16:33.050
<v Speaker 3>what can I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

384
00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:34.080
<v Speaker 3>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

385
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.940
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

386
00:16:34.941 --> 00:16:37.970
<v Speaker 3>so then I choose to start meditating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like the attic.</v>

387
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talk about addicts having been out of</v>

388
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:43.010
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but lots of addicts actually stop.</v>

389
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.040
<v Speaker 3>They break the addiction they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do they do it?</v>

390
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation,</v>

391
00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:47.990
<v Speaker 3>they used,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

392
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.380
<v Speaker 3>behave cognitive behavior therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go to these clinics and so on,</v>

393
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.390
<v Speaker 3>but they've got to drive themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

394
00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:56.270
<v Speaker 3>They got to actively do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're aware that they're doing that.</v>

395
00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 3>I would lump that into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're making kind of a free choice.</v>

396
00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:00.584
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could just keep doing your </v>

397
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:05.600
<v Speaker 3>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I was a determinism proponent,</v>

398
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.950
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>

399
00:17:06.951 --> 00:17:07.784
<v Speaker 3>because your decision to make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>choice is based on all of your </v>

400
00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:12.140
<v Speaker 3>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your genetics,</v>

401
00:17:12.141 --> 00:17:13.550
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your family,</v>

402
00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:14.384
<v Speaker 3>your background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of your input that you've gotten </v>

403
00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:17.564
<v Speaker 3>from other people about your behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've decided to make a choice </v>

404
00:17:20.631 --> 00:17:23.030
<v Speaker 3>based on that data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

405
00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:23.570
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

406
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:25.550
<v Speaker 3>that would be the counter give very </v>
<v Speaker 3>daunting.</v>

407
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.530
<v Speaker 3>But yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like that.</v>

408
00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:29.060
<v Speaker 3>I think also with consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

409
00:17:29.061 --> 00:17:31.490
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean by consciousness?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

410
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.230
<v Speaker 3>it's a hard problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

411
00:17:33.231 --> 00:17:35.690
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is it ever resolvable?</v>

412
00:17:35.691 --> 00:17:40.490
<v Speaker 3>So Depok thinks it's not just through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroscience explanation,</v>

413
00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.540
<v Speaker 3>bottom up molecules scaling up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emergent property,</v>

414
00:17:44.541 --> 00:17:48.050
<v Speaker 3>mind out of brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what most of us scientists think.</v>

415
00:17:48.051 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 3>People like Christof Koch Works on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

416
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's scaling up,</v>

417
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:52.374
<v Speaker 2>he's just looking at the visual cortex </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the back of the brain and looking at </v>

418
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.550
<v Speaker 2>visual conscious experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let's see if we can figure that out.</v>

419
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.460
<v Speaker 2>So I liked that approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But someone like Deepak says,</v>

420
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.400
<v Speaker 2>it'll never get us there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that he,</v>

421
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:09.630
<v Speaker 2>so he used language like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is the ground of being.</v>

422
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Now I know that phrase from Paul Tillich</v>
<v Speaker 2>who said God is the ground of being,</v>

423
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:15.290
<v Speaker 2>what does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

424
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not quite to say that consciousness</v>

425
00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:19.470
<v Speaker 2>is everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in here,</v>

426
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:21.960
<v Speaker 2>it's in the clock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in this table because that would be</v>

427
00:18:21.961 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 2>more of a sort of a deism or pantheism </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

428
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.383
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more like it's just a part of the </v>

429
00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:30.690
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

430
00:18:30.691 --> 00:18:34.350
<v Speaker 2>I really understand cause you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>deepak has a different language,</v>

431
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.193
<v Speaker 2>has that sort of that eastern wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditions like romy and so on and very </v>

432
00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:38.940
<v Speaker 2>kind.</v>

433
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:39.773
<v Speaker 2>I will call it word salad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a lot of word salad going </v>

434
00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:44.160
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like that to westerners.</v>

435
00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:46.590
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to put myself into his </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldview.</v>

436
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:47.483
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few months ago my wife and I went and </v>

437
00:18:49.531 --> 00:18:50.364
<v Speaker 2>spent three days at the Chopra Center </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the La Costa resort and spa in </v>

438
00:18:53.611 --> 00:18:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Carlsbad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

439
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a great weekend.</v>

440
00:18:56.581 --> 00:18:58.380
<v Speaker 2>And we did the full immersion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the t,</v>

441
00:18:58.381 --> 00:19:00.090
<v Speaker 2>the Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the yoga,</v>

442
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.620
<v Speaker 2>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>

443
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.340
<v Speaker 2>And I did feel much better afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But of course,</v>

444
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.300
<v Speaker 2>you can't go to the Lacosta spa and </v>
<v Speaker 2>resort in Carlsbad,</v>

445
00:19:09.301 --> 00:19:11.580
<v Speaker 2>California at the beach and not feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

446
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:13.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't feel good after that,</v>

447
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.270
<v Speaker 2>you're the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the system.</v>

448
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.580
<v Speaker 2>It's also the things you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're drinking tea,</v>

449
00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:19.730
<v Speaker 2>which is great for you doing yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is great for you.</v>

450
00:19:19.731 --> 00:19:20.564
<v Speaker 2>You're relaxing and that you're also </v>
<v Speaker 2>going there with the intent to try to </v>

451
00:19:22.981 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 2>make some positive change in your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to get on a good path.</v>

452
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.690
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all those things that good,</v>

453
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.700
<v Speaker 2>all those things are good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

454
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.613
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deepak just released a paper that was </v>

455
00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:34.320
<v Speaker 2>published this week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't one of the authors,</v>

456
00:19:34.321 --> 00:19:39.321
<v Speaker 2>but it was on the effects of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his program on biomarkers and various</v>

457
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:40.583
<v Speaker 2>physiological changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was conducted by a Harvard </v>

458
00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:48.471
<v Speaker 2>medical scientist named Rudy Tanzi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rudy is the scientist who discovered the</v>

459
00:19:48.481 --> 00:19:49.314
<v Speaker 2>genes for Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he does a lot of work with Alzheimer </v>

460
00:19:52.471 --> 00:19:54.060
<v Speaker 2>patients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

461
00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:54.894
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what extent do we have any meds to </v>

462
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:57.180
<v Speaker 2>treat it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>

463
00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about meditation?</v>

464
00:20:00.661 --> 00:20:02.700
<v Speaker 2>What about diet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These kinds of things.</v>

465
00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.813
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

466
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.720
<v Speaker 2>it's not terribly hopeful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

467
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.560
<v Speaker 2>maybe some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these supplements,</v>

468
00:20:07.561 --> 00:20:08.580
<v Speaker 2>who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

469
00:20:08.581 --> 00:20:11.370
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to know what are the effects </v>
<v Speaker 2>of meditation?</v>

470
00:20:11.371 --> 00:20:12.204
<v Speaker 2>I just regular people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they went to the La Costa resort and </v>

471
00:20:15.121 --> 00:20:15.954
<v Speaker 2>spa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's already a six day program that </v>

472
00:20:17.521 --> 00:20:20.130
<v Speaker 2>the tow percent of runs with its </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ayervetic,</v>

473
00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:21.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's yoga,</v>

474
00:20:21.211 --> 00:20:23.340
<v Speaker 2>it's meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's flowed diet,</v>

475
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:24.870
<v Speaker 2>massage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not massage.</v>

476
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:25.703
<v Speaker 2>And this particular one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although they'd have great massages </v>

477
00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:28.800
<v Speaker 2>there too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also healthy.</v>

478
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.550
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what they found was that,</v>

479
00:20:32.551 --> 00:20:36.240
<v Speaker 2>and so they compared a vacationers who </v>
<v Speaker 2>were just staying there at the resort.</v>

480
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.710
<v Speaker 2>They took all their various biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>markers to novice meditators.</v>

481
00:20:40.711 --> 00:20:42.390
<v Speaker 2>They taught them right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>

482
00:20:42.391 --> 00:20:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Day One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what we do.</v>

483
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Go through it in 20 minutes and 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

484
00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:47.290
<v Speaker 2>And so it meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga,</v>

485
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.453
<v Speaker 2>and then a group of people that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>already there that were serious daily </v>

486
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Meditators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been doing it their whole lives.</v>

487
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was a difference.</v>

488
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:56.501
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

489
00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 2>everybody got better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your blood pressure goes down,</v>

490
00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:03.250
<v Speaker 2>stress hormones are practically zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all these great markers,</v>

491
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:06.310
<v Speaker 2>including the vacationers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they found a difference between the</v>

492
00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:07.144
<v Speaker 2>vacationers and the meditation group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the claim is that you could go on </v>

493
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:11.254
<v Speaker 2>vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't do that every day of your </v>

494
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:13.354
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can meditate everyday of your </v>

495
00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:14.950
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

496
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:19.060
<v Speaker 2>So the effects of meditation may be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like you can do it at home.</v>

497
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relaxation,</v>

498
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:22.720
<v Speaker 2>the meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the focus,</v>

499
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you call that focus thought,</v>

500
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on your mantra.</v>

501
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.290
<v Speaker 2>A actually cha has physiological </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes,</v>

502
00:21:29.291 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 2>one of which was affecting Beta </v>
<v Speaker 2>amyloids,</v>

503
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:35.650
<v Speaker 2>which are the kit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chemicals that cause the plaques and</v>

504
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:38.620
<v Speaker 2>tangles in neurons that cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's.</v>

505
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.233
<v Speaker 2>So Rudy's argument was that it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's sort of a causal chain there </v>

506
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:46.720
<v Speaker 2>that that meditation leads to less </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress,</v>

507
00:21:46.721 --> 00:21:47.554
<v Speaker 2>less inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and therefore less of these buildup </v>

508
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.080
<v Speaker 2>plaques and tangles around the neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kills him.</v>

509
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's what happens in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's.</v>

510
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Your brain just dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurons die.</v>

511
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.730
<v Speaker 2>So amongst various factors that might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>effective,</v>

512
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.300
<v Speaker 2>meditation may work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now someone like Sam who does meditation</v>

513
00:22:04.301 --> 00:22:07.510
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would look for a causal chain,</v>

514
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the bottom up.</v>

515
00:22:08.591 --> 00:22:09.630
<v Speaker 2>What are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

516
00:22:09.631 --> 00:22:10.464
<v Speaker 2>the effects of having certain thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 2>in one part of your brain affects a </v>

517
00:22:12.761 --> 00:22:15.070
<v Speaker 2>different part of your brain and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>causes neuro chemical,</v>

518
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.060
<v Speaker 2>hormonal changes.</v>

519
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.440
<v Speaker 2>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deep Buck,</v>

520
00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:18.274
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to use a different argument and </v>

521
00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:23.710
<v Speaker 2>say it has to do with mind that not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not brain,</v>

522
00:22:23.711 --> 00:22:27.050
<v Speaker 2>but mind consciousness that's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

523
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.320
<v Speaker 2>but even saying it's out there is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct,</v>

524
00:22:29.321 --> 00:22:30.154
<v Speaker 2>but any guys that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter what the worldview </v>

525
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:33.580
<v Speaker 2>differences are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

526
00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.950
<v Speaker 2>in terms of does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it works,</v>

527
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.761
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

528
00:22:36.761 --> 00:22:39.550
<v Speaker 2>this would be good if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people that meditate,</v>

529
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.230
<v Speaker 2>even people that aren't sort of new agey</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

530
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.690
<v Speaker 2>or eastern religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

531
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.940
<v Speaker 2>they say it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

532
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.130
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

533
00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:51.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it myself and I do other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I think are relaxing,</v>

534
00:22:51.131 --> 00:22:52.300
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

535
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.253
<v Speaker 2>but if it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares what the explanation is </v>

536
00:22:54.881 --> 00:22:56.400
<v Speaker 2>initially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

537
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.600
<v Speaker 2>it'd be nice to know something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>

538
00:22:58.601 --> 00:23:01.660
<v Speaker 2>So it turns out from this new study just</v>
<v Speaker 2>published in nature,</v>

539
00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:02.953
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that meditation seems to be effective </v>

540
00:23:04.871 --> 00:23:06.970
<v Speaker 2>for these biomarkers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including telomers.</v>

541
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.940
<v Speaker 2>It increases telomerased race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which causes the telomeres at the end of</v>

542
00:23:09.941 --> 00:23:14.410
<v Speaker 2>your chromosomes to either stay the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>length or to grow a little bit.</v>

543
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:15.663
<v Speaker 2>And that has direct relations to aging </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we know that the hayflick limit </v>

544
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:20.973
<v Speaker 2>on the number of times a cell can divide</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you get get to that upper </v>

545
00:23:24.581 --> 00:23:26.500
<v Speaker 2>ceiling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the cells are dead.</v>

546
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.470
<v Speaker 2>And that's what causes aging ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 2>is genetics.</v>

547
00:23:29.471 --> 00:23:34.471
<v Speaker 2>So if there was a way to sort of slow </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the process of the telomere ease,</v>

548
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.913
<v Speaker 2>degrading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe through the production of more </v>

549
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Tele Marie's chemicals that co you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>effects that,</v>

550
00:23:42.101 --> 00:23:42.934
<v Speaker 2>then if meditation is one of those or </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet whenever that would be a good </v>

551
00:23:45.741 --> 00:23:46.240
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

552
00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.073
<v Speaker 3>So down we'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they determine that from studying the </v>

553
00:23:49.071 --> 00:23:49.904
<v Speaker 3>exact same person and studying them </v>
<v Speaker 3>premeditation in post meditation and </v>

554
00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:56.900
<v Speaker 3>studying the rate the telomeres start to</v>
<v Speaker 3>decline.</v>

555
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.700
<v Speaker 3>But there's particular study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just uh,</v>

556
00:23:58.770 --> 00:23:59.603
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the control group versus the </v>

557
00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 3>experimental group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the meditators versus non-meditators and</v>

558
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:06.490
<v Speaker 3>the vacationers and how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how much of c,</v>

559
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.800
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that that's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you would want to study over a long</v>

560
00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:11.170
<v Speaker 3>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you would,</v>

561
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:12.043
<v Speaker 3>you would have actually have to study </v>
<v Speaker 3>the person over a long period of time </v>

562
00:24:15.531 --> 00:24:18.080
<v Speaker 3>before they're meditating to really get </v>
<v Speaker 3>a base.</v>

563
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if anyone's done that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

564
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.670
<v Speaker 3>but that would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be good.</v>

565
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.271
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need,</v>

566
00:24:23.271 --> 00:24:26.210
<v Speaker 3>we need more scientists themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rudy and his team said,</v>

567
00:24:26.211 --> 00:24:27.650
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to replicate this.</v>

568
00:24:27.651 --> 00:24:28.484
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a one shot deal here six days </v>

569
00:24:30.201 --> 00:24:30.830
<v Speaker 3>at a resort.</v>

570
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.570
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to do more of this.</v>

571
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.850
<v Speaker 3>But the point is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

572
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:35.803
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>surely there is some value in some of </v>

573
00:24:37.431 --> 00:24:40.040
<v Speaker 3>these techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you call it,</v>

574
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:41.023
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so take the word salad out and stop </v>

575
00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:45.800
<v Speaker 3>using words like ground of being or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

576
00:24:45.801 --> 00:24:47.960
<v Speaker 3>Forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just consciousness.</v>

577
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:49.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

578
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.520
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain like way of talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people really enjoy hearing because</v>

579
00:24:54.921 --> 00:24:56.000
<v Speaker 3>it makes it sound like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

580
00:24:56.001 --> 00:24:56.834
<v Speaker 3>there's some sort of a mystical </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation and solution to all of the </v>

581
00:25:01.641 --> 00:25:04.160
<v Speaker 3>problems that modern day society </v>
<v Speaker 3>presents you with.</v>

582
00:25:04.161 --> 00:25:04.994
<v Speaker 3>And you could find those through this </v>
<v Speaker 3>course or this lecture or this book or </v>

583
00:25:07.941 --> 00:25:08.774
<v Speaker 3>this practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am now engaging in a practice that </v>

584
00:25:11.271 --> 00:25:13.630
<v Speaker 3>separates me from the stresses of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern life.</v>

585
00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.003
<v Speaker 3>But I think that what you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>about meditation and other things that </v>

586
00:25:17.571 --> 00:25:20.690
<v Speaker 3>you do that relax you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very important to relax.</v>

587
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.420
<v Speaker 3>And I think we all know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the real problems with</v>

588
00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:25.400
<v Speaker 3>our world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our society today,</v>

589
00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.950
<v Speaker 3>especially in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is so go,</v>

590
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:29.300
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go that.</v>

591
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:33.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you are an athlete and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>train constantly,</v>

592
00:25:33.591 --> 00:25:36.140
<v Speaker 3>one of the most important things is </v>
<v Speaker 3>recovery.</v>

593
00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.213
<v Speaker 3>It's a critical aspect of athleticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you just train and you don't </v>

594
00:25:40.521 --> 00:25:42.290
<v Speaker 3>recover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body breaks down,</v>

595
00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.453
<v Speaker 3>you're red lining your system and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not giving your system the proper time </v>

596
00:25:45.801 --> 00:25:48.410
<v Speaker 3>to recover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that when you meditate,</v>

597
00:25:48.411 --> 00:25:49.244
<v Speaker 3>and for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my big one is a sensory deprivation </v>

598
00:25:51.561 --> 00:25:52.394
<v Speaker 3>tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have one in my basement and I go in </v>

599
00:25:54.251 --> 00:25:55.084
<v Speaker 3>and all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the most relaxing thing in the </v>

600
00:25:57.921 --> 00:26:00.980
<v Speaker 3>world because you're going in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the water's the same temperature as your</v>

601
00:26:00.981 --> 00:26:02.720
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

602
00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.750
<v Speaker 3>And in doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that is,</v>

603
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no motion at all.</v>

604
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.533
<v Speaker 3>I'm concentrating completely on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing until I achieve this certain </v>

605
00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:14.840
<v Speaker 3>state of consciousness that I get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I go in there.</v>

606
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.793
<v Speaker 3>And the way I get to it is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrating entirely on breathing in </v>

607
00:26:19.461 --> 00:26:20.294
<v Speaker 3>and breathing out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just think about in with the good </v>

608
00:26:22.181 --> 00:26:23.890
<v Speaker 3>and out with the bad and in with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>good and,</v>

609
00:26:23.891 --> 00:26:27.380
<v Speaker 3>and that's what my only thoughts that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to maintain.</v>

610
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.740
<v Speaker 3>Other thoughts get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They bounce around and they ricochet out</v>

611
00:26:30.741 --> 00:26:33.320
<v Speaker 3>and eventually they stop existing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it is meditation,</v>

612
00:26:33.321 --> 00:26:38.321
<v Speaker 3>it's a meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think any form of just right,</v>

613
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.170
<v Speaker 3>just give your body a chance to give </v>
<v Speaker 3>your heart rate,</v>

614
00:26:42.171 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 3>a chance to drop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give your mind</v>

615
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.010
<v Speaker 2>a chance to slow its revolutions per </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>

616
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.630
<v Speaker 2>Just give yourself some time to recover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also reflection.</v>

617
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Give yourself some time to consider the </v>
<v Speaker 2>momentum of your life.</v>

618
00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Because I think that is also a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue with people is that your life sort</v>

619
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:05.751
<v Speaker 2>of starts taking over you and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions and your,</v>

620
00:27:06.241 --> 00:27:08.940
<v Speaker 2>your the things that you do during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

621
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:09.953
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them would get based on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>momentum of the things you've already </v>

622
00:27:12.391 --> 00:27:14.850
<v Speaker 2>done versus what you actually want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

623
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just kind of gets out of hand and</v>

624
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:21.240
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a chance to step back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it and go,</v>

625
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 2>I got to stop doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I need to do more of this,</v>

626
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:28.860
<v Speaker 2>or I have to figure a way to not do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

627
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:30.600
<v Speaker 2>all these things together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

628
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:31.543
<v Speaker 2>whatever the decision you make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those decisions come out of </v>

629
00:27:34.141 --> 00:27:34.974
<v Speaker 2>reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which comes out of space away from the </v>

630
00:27:37.891 --> 00:27:41.670
<v Speaker 2>actual thing and time and thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

631
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:46.500
<v Speaker 2>My Jewish friends telling me that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what the Sabbath is for Friday night,</v>

632
00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:49.510
<v Speaker 2>sundown til Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sun Sundown makes sense.</v>

633
00:27:49.511 --> 00:27:50.700
<v Speaker 2>That's a time of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

634
00:27:50.701 --> 00:27:51.720
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>

635
00:27:51.721 --> 00:27:53.400
<v Speaker 2>reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no TV,</v>

636
00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:55.170
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're off social media,</v>

637
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:56.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that stuff.</v>

638
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.713
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a smart thing and that's an </v>

639
00:27:59.161 --> 00:28:00.480
<v Speaker 2>old tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

640
00:28:00.481 --> 00:28:01.740
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Set by eight.</v>

641
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.600
<v Speaker 2>Even my Jewish friends are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious.</v>

642
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:04.463
<v Speaker 2>It's just a cultural thing and that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably a good thing now where </v>

643
00:28:08.011 --> 00:28:08.844
<v Speaker 2>it gets a little out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I like another one of my full </v>

644
00:28:11.101 --> 00:28:11.934
<v Speaker 2>emergence for my chapter on De puck and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eastern religious traditions of my next </v>

645
00:28:15.451 --> 00:28:17.100
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heavens on earth.</v>

646
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.293
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went to see depok and t eckart Toley </v>

647
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:24.090
<v Speaker 2>who did a show at the shrine auditorium </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Los Angeles.</v>

648
00:28:24.091 --> 00:28:26.340
<v Speaker 2>The power of now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of now this guy,</v>

649
00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean this place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a,</v>

650
00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:31.290
<v Speaker 2>it must have been 3000 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>4,000</v>

651
00:28:31.291 --> 00:28:33.060
<v Speaker 2>people there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

652
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.790
<v Speaker 2>paid 50 bucks a head or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

653
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.270
<v Speaker 2>it was like wow.</v>

654
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.090
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And deep hot cache.</v>

655
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it costs to rent the,</v>

656
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.360
<v Speaker 2>the shrine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those are expensive.</v>

657
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

658
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:43.831
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

659
00:28:43.831 --> 00:28:44.664
<v Speaker 2>the two of them just sort of walked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and down the stage and just talked and </v>

660
00:28:46.801 --> 00:28:47.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds knows.</v>

661
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very much like that.</v>

662
00:28:49.621 --> 00:28:50.454
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that attend these are fairly </v>

663
00:28:53.071 --> 00:28:53.904
<v Speaker 2>well off people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can sort of tell them the parking </v>

664
00:28:54.931 --> 00:28:56.910
<v Speaker 2>lot how they're dressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing with,</v>

665
00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this last weekend I was at the sages and</v>

666
00:28:59.551 --> 00:29:02.960
<v Speaker 2>scientists conference at Depok puts on </v>
<v Speaker 2>every year this year instead of at this,</v>

667
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:04.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the La Costa resort,</v>

668
00:29:04.981 --> 00:29:06.990
<v Speaker 2>it was at the Beverly Wilshire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

669
00:29:06.991 --> 00:29:10.560
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of people from La that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are depok fans and they go,</v>

670
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:11.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are not your normal run of the </v>

671
00:29:12.811 --> 00:29:13.591
<v Speaker 2>mill folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

672
00:29:13.591 --> 00:29:14.490
<v Speaker 2>these are people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

673
00:29:14.491 --> 00:29:15.840
<v Speaker 2>upper middleclass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

674
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.750
<v Speaker 2>good looking well off driving nice cars.</v>

675
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever been to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Beverly Wilshire,</v>

676
00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:22.650
<v Speaker 2>but if you sit at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a little bar,</v>

677
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

678
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wolfgang puck's bar and you know,</v>

679
00:29:27.751 --> 00:29:29.850
<v Speaker 2>so they have good German beer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which my wife and I liked,</v>

680
00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:31.350
<v Speaker 2>cause she's in Germany and we just sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

681
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:32.820
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I watch these cars pull up,</v>

682
00:29:32.821 --> 00:29:33.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ferrari,</v>

683
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Lamborghini,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rolls Royce Bentley,</v>

684
00:29:35.851 --> 00:29:36.900
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

685
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.320
<v Speaker 2>this is not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my caltech events,</v>

686
00:29:40.321 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with science geeks coming,</v>

687
00:29:42.011 --> 00:29:42.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

688
00:29:42.351 --> 00:29:43.184
<v Speaker 2>it's a different audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I do wonder the people that are in </v>

689
00:29:46.871 --> 00:29:48.620
<v Speaker 2>that particular study that Rudy Tanzi </v>
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

690
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:52.780
<v Speaker 2>this is not a randomly picked sample </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the general population.</v>

691
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:54.011
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

692
00:29:54.011 --> 00:29:55.990
<v Speaker 2>they have different kinds of problems or</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>

693
00:29:55.991 --> 00:29:56.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them.</v>

694
00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental,</v>

695
00:29:57.851 --> 00:29:58.684
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that might be affected by </v>

696
00:30:00.791 --> 00:30:03.070
<v Speaker 2>psychological states anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

697
00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.700
<v Speaker 2>it's different from the physiological </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes they,</v>

698
00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:07.540
<v Speaker 2>they mark but still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

699
00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:08.374
<v Speaker 2>but when you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we watched the shrine auditorium thing </v>

700
00:30:10.211 --> 00:30:11.830
<v Speaker 2>with Eckhart Tolle and he's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>

701
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he speaks in a manner,</v>

702
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.600
<v Speaker 2>I can't even imitate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just very soft,</v>

703
00:30:16.601 --> 00:30:17.434
<v Speaker 2>very slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could almost feel myself like melting </v>

704
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:21.130
<v Speaker 2>into the chair like Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not,</v>

705
00:30:21.131 --> 00:30:22.660
<v Speaker 2>it is very hypnotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

706
00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever been hypnotized?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

707
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it feels like.</v>

708
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

709
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.740
<v Speaker 2>So he is probably doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

710
00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:28.863
<v Speaker 2>he's bringing the audience to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>state of thinking and I'm sure it is </v>

711
00:30:33.161 --> 00:30:37.120
<v Speaker 2>effective for the now and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technically he and d bucher right.</v>

712
00:30:37.121 --> 00:30:39.080
<v Speaker 2>That there really is only the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you know,</v>

713
00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:43.440
<v Speaker 2>about the three seconds or so of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>current state of before,</v>

714
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.700
<v Speaker 2>after the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And before the PR future,</v>

715
00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:47.140
<v Speaker 2>it's just it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

716
00:30:47.141 --> 00:30:47.974
<v Speaker 2>and even your memories of the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just neurons firing in your brain </v>

717
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.140
<v Speaker 2>now of what happened in the past and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>future is really,</v>

718
00:30:56.141 --> 00:30:56.974
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't happened yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just your neurons firing in </v>

719
00:30:58.781 --> 00:31:00.400
<v Speaker 2>anticipation of what might happen.</v>

720
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.080
<v Speaker 2>So they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really,</v>

721
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.930
<v Speaker 2>they all the action is now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

722
00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:06.550
<v Speaker 2>of course as I like to joke a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

723
00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.800
<v Speaker 2>my three days joe percent or at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

724
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:10.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

725
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.940
<v Speaker 2>at the new age place up in big Sur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

726
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:15.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>

727
00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one on the right on the cliffs,</v>

728
00:31:16.761 --> 00:31:17.594
<v Speaker 2>the Isilon Institute that had been there</v>
<v Speaker 2>several times and it's super relaxing </v>

729
00:31:20.471 --> 00:31:22.030
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

730
00:31:22.031 --> 00:31:24.460
<v Speaker 2>the now ends on Monday morning and to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to work,</v>

731
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

732
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:30.120
<v Speaker 2>my mortgage has a now coming up pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>soon called the payment and you know,</v>

733
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know to what extent you can live</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that condition all of the time,</v>

734
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.740
<v Speaker 2>but if you take it in moderation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

735
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.110
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just once in a while to step back once a</v>

736
00:31:38.111 --> 00:31:39.430
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once a day,</v>

737
00:31:39.431 --> 00:31:40.960
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For 10 minutes,</v>

738
00:31:40.961 --> 00:31:44.320
<v Speaker 2>half an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour deprivation tank once a day.</v>

739
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Something that seems pretty reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

740
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:52.240
<v Speaker 2>very reasonable and very beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those people that you're talking</v>

741
00:31:52.241 --> 00:31:53.074
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do have a whole different set of </v>

742
00:31:54.041 --> 00:31:54.874
<v Speaker 2>problems because they have achieved </v>
<v Speaker 2>material wealth beyond the imagination </v>

743
00:31:57.881 --> 00:32:00.400
<v Speaker 2>of the average person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're pulling up in a Ferrari,</v>

744
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.380
<v Speaker 2>you're essentially pulling up in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

745
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:03.243
<v Speaker 2>You're driving a house around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're driving a 200 plus thousand </v>

746
00:32:06.041 --> 00:32:08.530
<v Speaker 2>dollar automobile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which to most people,</v>

747
00:32:08.531 --> 00:32:11.380
<v Speaker 2>it's just crazy like that someone could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have one of those.</v>

748
00:32:11.381 --> 00:32:12.214
<v Speaker 2>So that kind of a person who isn't happy</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the type of person that wants to go </v>

749
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:20.680
<v Speaker 2>to some sort of a seminar by a health </v>
<v Speaker 2>guru.</v>

750
00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that Blue Lamborghini.</v>

751
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:24.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing is too much.</v>

752
00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.380
<v Speaker 2>Those things will break down the two </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>

753
00:32:26.381 --> 00:32:28.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're gonna invest,</v>

754
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:28.983
<v Speaker 2>that's not the move Bahrain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably some oem oil money </v>

755
00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:33.490
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at,</v>

756
00:32:33.491 --> 00:32:36.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the hotels in Beverly Hills.</v>

757
00:32:36.341 --> 00:32:40.000
<v Speaker 2>I had dinner there and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this [inaudible]</v>

758
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.240
<v Speaker 1>pulled in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a more than a million dollars and</v>

759
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:45.590
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're like one point,</v>

760
00:32:45.591 --> 00:32:46.424
<v Speaker 1>what didn't we look it up like 1.3,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter one point $3 million </v>

761
00:32:49.251 --> 00:32:50.084
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it had the Saudi Arabian plates on </v>

762
00:32:51.771 --> 00:32:55.460
<v Speaker 1>it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually had palace plates.</v>

763
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:56.323
<v Speaker 1>It said something palace on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was some royal person sent his </v>

764
00:32:59.781 --> 00:33:03.010
<v Speaker 1>car over either in a boat or on a plane </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

765
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.050
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

766
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:04.933
<v Speaker 1>that car and then there's a million of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these other super expensive luxury cars </v>

767
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:11.750
<v Speaker 1>all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people have their own problems and</v>

768
00:33:11.751 --> 00:33:12.584
<v Speaker 1>we would like the average person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>works all day and has a pile of bills </v>

769
00:33:16.041 --> 00:33:17.960
<v Speaker 1>and has all this debt is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>

770
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.823
<v Speaker 1>I would love to be a rich person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the hell these fucking rich people </v>

771
00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.690
<v Speaker 1>still have problems?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

772
00:33:23.691 --> 00:33:24.524
<v Speaker 1>But you get used to your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get used to your life and if your </v>

773
00:33:28.491 --> 00:33:32.990
<v Speaker 1>life is being an indigenous person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in Bolivia and the jungle and you</v>

774
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.380
<v Speaker 1>shoot spears at fish and that's how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get by.</v>

775
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.450
<v Speaker 1>If that's what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get used to that life,</v>

776
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:39.284
<v Speaker 1>that life becomes your life and you find</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and maybe you don't find as </v>

777
00:33:44.421 --> 00:33:47.660
<v Speaker 1>many when you were in a hunter gatherer </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribe as you do,</v>

778
00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:48.494
<v Speaker 1>if you're a some sort of a hedge fund </v>
<v Speaker 1>manager who's just on adderall every </v>

779
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:53.773
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's completely stressed out and your </v>

780
00:33:54.501 --> 00:33:55.334
<v Speaker 1>wife driving you crazy and your mistress</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants you to leave your wife and you </v>

781
00:33:57.951 --> 00:34:00.760
<v Speaker 1>don't know how the fuck you got yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this situation and,</v>

782
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:01.993
<v Speaker 1>and then you decide I'm going to go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this power of now seminar and </v>

783
00:34:04.191 --> 00:34:05.480
<v Speaker 1>straightened my shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

784
00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Pull up in your Blue Ferrari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like there's problems.</v>

785
00:34:10.491 --> 00:34:13.670
<v Speaker 1>People create problems and just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone has material wealth,</v>

786
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.863
<v Speaker 1>not only does it not eliminate problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it creates a whole new slew of problems </v>

787
00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:20.893
<v Speaker 1>that would lead to the kind of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>indulgent sort of exploration of your </v>

788
00:34:25.971 --> 00:34:29.380
<v Speaker 1>condition that these things sort of in </v>
<v Speaker 1>force and</v>

789
00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.580
<v Speaker 2>cater to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

790
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

791
00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.790
<v Speaker 2>So you got to go back to work the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>day or whatever.</v>

792
00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.620
<v Speaker 2>But another point I made in my talk for </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

793
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:38.261
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

794
00:34:38.261 --> 00:34:40.180
<v Speaker 2>there he is with the fam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

795
00:34:40.181 --> 00:34:41.680
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super Nice Guy.</v>

796
00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he really does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

797
00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.800
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

798
00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:45.850
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

799
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.753
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to one of these workshops and </v>

800
00:34:49.181 --> 00:34:51.250
<v Speaker 2>you feel much better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's been a few studies,</v>

801
00:34:51.251 --> 00:34:52.790
<v Speaker 2>not many like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

802
00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:55.480
<v Speaker 2>big corporations hire people like Tony </v>
<v Speaker 2>Robbins to come in and,</v>

803
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give the Spiel to,</v>

804
00:34:56.771 --> 00:34:58.690
<v Speaker 2>they get the salesforce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fire it up.</v>

805
00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:59.583
<v Speaker 2>And they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are fired up near as we can tell </v>

806
00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:02.081
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

807
00:35:02.081 --> 00:35:04.330
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the effect lasts for a couple of weeks.</v>

808
00:35:04.331 --> 00:35:05.164
<v Speaker 2>They go back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hitting the phones are making </v>

809
00:35:06.371 --> 00:35:08.000
<v Speaker 2>those calls or making more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

810
00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:08.950
<v Speaker 2>it's work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

811
00:35:08.951 --> 00:35:12.010
<v Speaker 2>and then it tapers and they're right </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to where they were motherfuckers.</v>

812
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.080
<v Speaker 2>So this is why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

813
00:35:14.081 --> 00:35:17.200
<v Speaker 2>we published a study on this and skeptic</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the number one predictor of anybody</v>

814
00:35:17.201 --> 00:35:18.034
<v Speaker 2>that would buy one of those books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self help books or go to the seminars </v>

815
00:35:19.841 --> 00:35:23.560
<v Speaker 2>are people that have already done so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they do an over and over and over.</v>

816
00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.600
<v Speaker 2>So in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it worked,</v>

817
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.450
<v Speaker 2>why do you have to keep buying the books</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the tapes and the,</v>

818
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:33.430
<v Speaker 2>and the going to the seminars and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>it only works for just a little while.</v>

819
00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever heard of it?</v>

820
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.610
<v Speaker 2>The expression</v>

821
00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:37.890
<v Speaker 1>that inspiration is like bathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very effective,</v>

822
00:35:37.891 --> 00:35:39.810
<v Speaker 1>but it must be practiced on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

823
00:35:39.811 --> 00:35:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

824
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.500
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be it.</v>

825
00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:42.820
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

826
00:35:42.821 --> 00:35:44.710
<v Speaker 2>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two senses in,</v>

827
00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:47.590
<v Speaker 2>does it work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it work for you personally?</v>

828
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then does it work for everybody?</v>

829
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.033
<v Speaker 2>So the scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scientists want to know is not that </v>

830
00:35:53.591 --> 00:35:54.424
<v Speaker 2>you personally feel better when you went</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the La Casa spa and resort for three </v>

831
00:35:56.951 --> 00:35:57.790
<v Speaker 2>days of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

832
00:35:57.791 --> 00:35:58.624
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but can we actually measure the </v>

833
00:36:00.551 --> 00:36:02.980
<v Speaker 2>differences and then apply that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody?</v>

834
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not just that resort,</v>

835
00:36:04.871 --> 00:36:06.820
<v Speaker 2>but any resort or is it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

836
00:36:06.821 --> 00:36:11.740
<v Speaker 2>60% of the people between ages of 25 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 that have these medical conditions or</v>

837
00:36:11.741 --> 00:36:13.810
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we apply that technique,</v>

838
00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40% of the time they'll get better.</v>

839
00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:18.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really what we want to know.</v>

840
00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:20.170
<v Speaker 2>So on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand,</v>

841
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody says,</v>

842
00:36:20.981 --> 00:36:22.750
<v Speaker 2>I went to detox place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt better.</v>

843
00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:23.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that they felt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

844
00:36:23.891 --> 00:36:26.290
<v Speaker 2>the world's a little bit better place if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel better.</v>

845
00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From a scientist perspective,</v>

846
00:36:28.271 --> 00:36:29.410
<v Speaker 2>like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting,</v>

847
00:36:29.411 --> 00:36:33.490
<v Speaker 2>but does it really work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just placebo or not just temporary.</v>

848
00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:37.940
<v Speaker 2>It's like a Netflix just released that </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary based on um,</v>

849
00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Tony Robbins and the film is called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not your guru,</v>

850
00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.660
<v Speaker 2>but clearly watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what everybody thinks.</v>

851
00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.720
<v Speaker 2>That's my girl who they want to be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

852
00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:49.840
<v Speaker 2>And he has this hypnotic effect on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>

853
00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:51.820
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anything like it,</v>

854
00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.000
<v Speaker 2>but the question is when they go home a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week later,</v>

855
00:36:55.001 --> 00:36:57.310
<v Speaker 2>two weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it make any difference?</v>

856
00:36:57.311 --> 00:36:58.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they feel better there.</v>

857
00:36:59.110 --> 00:36:59.943
<v Speaker 1>Tony Robbins says a lot of really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and he says a lot of really </v>

858
00:37:02.621 --> 00:37:04.510
<v Speaker 1>motivational things that I listened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

859
00:37:04.511 --> 00:37:07.180
<v Speaker 1>this guy's making a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet he does a lot of people,</v>

860
00:37:07.181 --> 00:37:08.014
<v Speaker 1>a lot of good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I always ask is what has he done </v>

861
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.500
<v Speaker 1>other than do these seminars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

862
00:37:14.501 --> 00:37:15.334
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's become really effective in </v>

863
00:37:16.721 --> 00:37:19.750
<v Speaker 1>motivating people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what has he done other than motivate</v>

864
00:37:19.751 --> 00:37:20.440
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

865
00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.273
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he produced anything other than these </v>

866
00:37:22.781 --> 00:37:25.450
<v Speaker 1>books that are designed to motivate </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

867
00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:26.403
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate what he does and I </v>

868
00:37:28.211 --> 00:37:29.044
<v Speaker 1>don't want to belittle it because I read</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of his stuff back when I was </v>

869
00:37:31.421 --> 00:37:35.050
<v Speaker 1>competing in martial arts and when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting out as a standup comedian,</v>

870
00:37:35.051 --> 00:37:36.610
<v Speaker 1>I read a lot of his stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

871
00:37:36.611 --> 00:37:38.530
<v Speaker 1>and it motivated me and it gave me some </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

872
00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.900
<v Speaker 1>good things to think about that.</v>

873
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:41.733
<v Speaker 1>I think I was already sort of on a self </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement path and I was trying to </v>

874
00:37:44.441 --> 00:37:46.690
<v Speaker 1>take in a lot of information from a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of different places,</v>

875
00:37:46.691 --> 00:37:47.524
<v Speaker 1>including dianetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought it dianetics book and they </v>

876
00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.300
<v Speaker 1>hounded me for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on the list.</v>

877
00:37:52.301 --> 00:37:53.134
<v Speaker 1>Heck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ordered it late night on one of those </v>

878
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.673
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's interesting what he's </v>

879
00:37:59.381 --> 00:38:04.381
<v Speaker 1>done because it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if a guy like steve jobs or you</v>

880
00:38:06.281 --> 00:38:08.650
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Wazniak who created apple,</v>

881
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:13.710
<v Speaker 1>if they made a book on how to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated and get something done,</v>

882
00:38:14.411 --> 00:38:19.411
<v Speaker 1>and here's the core core aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>success in this endeavor.</v>

883
00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.240
<v Speaker 1>And I've done this and I want you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know this,</v>

884
00:38:22.241 --> 00:38:23.074
<v Speaker 1>I want to spread this knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when a guy is just motivating </v>

885
00:38:25.631 --> 00:38:26.464
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

886
00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.453
<v Speaker 1>I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I know a guy who just motivates </v>

887
00:38:28.721 --> 00:38:29.554
<v Speaker 1>people and he's a terrible comedian and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just decided to start motivating </v>

888
00:38:33.131 --> 00:38:33.920
<v Speaker 1>people now.</v>

889
00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.571
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

890
00:38:34.571 --> 00:38:36.140
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

891
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.880
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile people buy it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people love that feeling.</v>

892
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.880
<v Speaker 1>They love that feeling of someone saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that makes sense,</v>

893
00:38:42.881 --> 00:38:44.710
<v Speaker 1>that gets them going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

894
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:45.813
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to eat plant based and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go jogging every day and I'm </v>

895
00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:49.774
<v Speaker 1>doing yoga four times a week and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to drink only water and I'm going </v>

896
00:38:53.181 --> 00:38:54.070
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

897
00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:57.130
<v Speaker 1>and then one day they passed by Krispy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kreme in that hot.</v>

898
00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:00.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of fresh sign is on those hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>doughnuts.</v>

899
00:39:00.521 --> 00:39:02.920
<v Speaker 1>You get one of those glazed hot babies </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your system.</v>

900
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thing,</v>

901
00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:05.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're having a coffee and they throw </v>

902
00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:09.400
<v Speaker 1>sugar and it fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Already have the sugar and the donut.</v>

903
00:39:09.401 --> 00:39:10.234
<v Speaker 1>Coffee tastes better with sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hope it's better than the little </v>

904
00:39:13.271 --> 00:39:13.961
<v Speaker 1>joke about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

905
00:39:13.961 --> 00:39:15.650
<v Speaker 1>the guy who took an ad out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper says,</v>

906
00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:16.330
<v Speaker 1>send me a dollar.</v>

907
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:20.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you how to make $1 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run an ad in a newspaper and said you,</v>

908
00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.513
<v Speaker 1>he's better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course is a great collector of </v>

909
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:29.820
<v Speaker 1>philosophical points that really can </v>
<v Speaker 1>affect you if you absorb them.</v>

910
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.413
<v Speaker 1>I think what you pointed out about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of people that get involved in </v>

911
00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:38.590
<v Speaker 1>these things that don't actually have </v>
<v Speaker 1>any longterm change in their life.</v>

912
00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I think what it's like is like Rehab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

913
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:46.600
<v Speaker 1>my friend Chris Bell who made this </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent documentary,</v>

914
00:39:46.601 --> 00:39:49.690
<v Speaker 1>prescription thugs and he made bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

915
00:39:49.691 --> 00:39:53.560
<v Speaker 1>faster that documentary on steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really cool guy.</v>

916
00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was really fascinating is he went</v>

917
00:39:56.801 --> 00:39:59.980
<v Speaker 1>through making this documentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>prescription thugs,</v>

918
00:39:59.981 --> 00:40:00.814
<v Speaker 1>and then in the process of it had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty significant injury that got him </v>

919
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:05.793
<v Speaker 1>on pain pills and then he got hooked on </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain pills for himself while he's doing </v>

920
00:40:09.191 --> 00:40:12.880
<v Speaker 1>a documentary on pharmaceutical drugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>being highly addictive.</v>

921
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:13.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to this rehab and when he came </v>

922
00:40:16.451 --> 00:40:17.284
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast and was discussing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rehabilitation process for getting off </v>

923
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:21.544
<v Speaker 1>these pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important aspects was </v>

924
00:40:23.741 --> 00:40:24.574
<v Speaker 1>how much time it takes and how you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be fully immersed in this idea of </v>

925
00:40:28.871 --> 00:40:33.871
<v Speaker 1>recovery for a long period of time to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in this method to,</v>

926
00:40:34.261 --> 00:40:35.094
<v Speaker 1>to in order to enact any real change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's probably the same </v>

927
00:40:39.731 --> 00:40:40.564
<v Speaker 1>thing with motivational speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can get that initial burst </v>

928
00:40:43.871 --> 00:40:46.780
<v Speaker 1>where somebody could slap you and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Mike,</v>

929
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking these fucking pills away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

930
00:40:48.591 --> 00:40:50.350
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't keep taking these things.</v>

931
00:40:50.351 --> 00:40:50.951
<v Speaker 1>You're hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

932
00:40:50.951 --> 00:40:51.521
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

933
00:40:51.521 --> 00:40:52.780
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to change.</v>

934
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:55.360
<v Speaker 1>So this is both burst of motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a good man.</v>

935
00:40:55.361 --> 00:40:57.850
<v Speaker 1>You're a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're too smart for these pills.</v>

936
00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:58.811
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

937
00:40:58.811 --> 00:40:59.260
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

938
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.093
<v Speaker 1>You get that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wake up the next day and you'd go </v>

939
00:41:01.301 --> 00:41:02.134
<v Speaker 1>jog and you get a good sweat and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>go and you'd get some wheat grass juice </v>

940
00:41:04.241 --> 00:41:05.530
<v Speaker 1>and you power that down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

941
00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:06.453
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the inspiration dies off and </v>

942
00:41:09.671 --> 00:41:13.840
<v Speaker 1>you so comfortably slide back into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>old ways.</v>

943
00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.273
<v Speaker 1>So I think these motivational speeches </v>
<v Speaker 1>by Anthony Robbins or any of these </v>

944
00:41:18.701 --> 00:41:20.950
<v Speaker 1>people that I think they can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>

945
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:21.963
<v Speaker 1>But I think for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comfort of their old path is such a </v>

946
00:41:25.661 --> 00:41:26.494
<v Speaker 1>magnet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their compass just just goes towards </v>

947
00:41:29.291 --> 00:41:30.124
<v Speaker 1>that magnet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like they needed every day </v>

948
00:41:33.741 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 1>for like</v>

949
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.130
<v Speaker 2>a year or two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three years.</v>

950
00:41:36.131 --> 00:41:36.964
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something already Tansy from Harvard </v>

951
00:41:38.331 --> 00:41:41.960
<v Speaker 2>tells me for a normal habit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes about 60 days,</v>

952
00:41:41.961 --> 00:41:45.170
<v Speaker 2>couple of two months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single day of retraining the brain</v>

953
00:41:45.171 --> 00:41:48.440
<v Speaker 2>on a new habit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just a regular habit,</v>

954
00:41:48.441 --> 00:41:49.274
<v Speaker 2>like drinking coffee or just what time </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get up in the morning or whatever </v>

955
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:53.630
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

956
00:41:53.631 --> 00:41:54.464
<v Speaker 2>so I suspect with drugs or alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably a year or two to really </v>

957
00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:01.580
<v Speaker 2>completely re retrain your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rewire the neurons,</v>

958
00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.970
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

959
00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.250
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to change that habit.</v>

960
00:42:04.251 --> 00:42:05.510
<v Speaker 2>It's doable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do it.</v>

961
00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.473
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

962
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:11.220
<v Speaker 2>it can be very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think part of the appeal of the,</v>

963
00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.333
<v Speaker 2>the self help groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so called self help gurus is that you </v>

964
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:17.190
<v Speaker 2>keep going because you need the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

965
00:42:17.191 --> 00:42:18.024
<v Speaker 2>there's sort of retrain reminder every </v>
<v Speaker 2>six months or you listen to the tapes </v>

966
00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:23.390
<v Speaker 2>once a day or once a week.</v>

967
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.613
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just kind of keeps the new habit </v>

968
00:42:27.081 --> 00:42:27.914
<v Speaker 2>reinforced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably literally dopamine hits from </v>

969
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:32.900
<v Speaker 2>hearing the voice of the person and </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like Tony Robins,</v>

970
00:42:32.901 --> 00:42:34.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've met him at Ted.</v>

971
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:36.110
<v Speaker 2>He's just bigger than life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's like six,</v>

972
00:42:36.111 --> 00:42:39.860
<v Speaker 2>eight huge hands and deep voice and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>talks.</v>

973
00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a great presence.</v>

974
00:42:42.591 --> 00:42:43.424
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's quite the opposite of Vec are </v>

975
00:42:46.281 --> 00:42:48.200
<v Speaker 2>totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he comes out in the stage and the</v>

976
00:42:48.201 --> 00:42:50.200
<v Speaker 2>music and the lights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right side kicks,</v>

977
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.490
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thrown this out.</v>

978
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

979
00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:54.680
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>words and shit cause kicks it boards.</v>

980
00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.053
<v Speaker 2>But in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this documentary is really quite </v>

981
00:42:57.141 --> 00:42:58.910
<v Speaker 2>revealing and it's called a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not your guru.</v>

982
00:42:58.911 --> 00:43:01.730
<v Speaker 2>It opens with him talking to this young </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

983
00:43:01.731 --> 00:43:02.564
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's German and he looks Super </v>

984
00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.193
<v Speaker 2>Sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's what with Bob?</v>

985
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:07.250
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's bugging you man?</v>

986
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Stand up.</v>

987
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:09.020
<v Speaker 2>It's bugging you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

988
00:43:09.021 --> 00:43:09.830
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

989
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:13.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm feeling suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as soon as he seen us in front of a</v>

990
00:43:13.311 --> 00:43:15.860
<v Speaker 2>large group of calling is 3000 people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this hotel room,</v>

991
00:43:15.861 --> 00:43:17.300
<v Speaker 2>cameras and lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

992
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.970
<v Speaker 2>he's going to Powell and he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

993
00:43:19.971 --> 00:43:22.160
<v Speaker 2>it was a little bit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's completely different way.</v>

994
00:43:22.161 --> 00:43:22.700
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

995
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:23.690
<v Speaker 2>he looks down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

996
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.120
<v Speaker 2>is it the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it the red shoes?</v>

997
00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.970
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

998
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.863
<v Speaker 2>You're red.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the fucking red issues I have </v>

999
00:43:30.561 --> 00:43:32.460
<v Speaker 2>ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>May those are fucking red shoes,</v>

1000
00:43:32.461 --> 00:43:34.220
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the camera goes,</v>

1001
00:43:34.221 --> 00:43:36.410
<v Speaker 2>Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got these red shoes and this.</v>

1002
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.333
<v Speaker 2>And the way he says it is so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy just starts laughing and Tony </v>

1003
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.560
<v Speaker 2>Goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you be laughing now because you're</v>

1004
00:43:42.561 --> 00:43:45.020
<v Speaker 2>going to spoil the program for suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1005
00:43:45.021 --> 00:43:46.430
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

1006
00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.300
<v Speaker 2>and then he just kind of worked on him </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1007
00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:49.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you feeling this?</v>

1008
00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.140
<v Speaker 2>And before you knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was,</v>

1009
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:52.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he seemed like he was doing much better </v>

1010
00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:57.640
<v Speaker 2>awareness as I pulled out a gun and blew</v>
<v Speaker 2>his brains out on the stage.</v>

1011
00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:58.993
<v Speaker 2>The shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that would've made the </v>

1012
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:01.574
<v Speaker 2>film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with that and another </v>

1013
00:44:03.471 --> 00:44:05.890
<v Speaker 2>story they show in there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there's no followup.</v>

1014
00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.450
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea this guy does.</v>

1015
00:44:08.451 --> 00:44:09.284
<v Speaker 2>He had another one with a woman who had </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight issues or something and </v>

1016
00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:15.380
<v Speaker 2>emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it your relationship you're in?</v>

1017
00:44:15.381 --> 00:44:15.921
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1018
00:44:15.921 --> 00:44:16.261
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1019
00:44:16.261 --> 00:44:17.860
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like doctor Laurie,</v>

1020
00:44:17.861 --> 00:44:20.000
<v Speaker 2>he's figured out after all these years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1021
00:44:20.001 --> 00:44:22.580
<v Speaker 2>your problem number seven years is </v>
<v Speaker 2>number six.</v>

1022
00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:26.990
<v Speaker 2>There's only like 10 things that covers </v>
<v Speaker 2>90% of anybody that would come,</v>

1023
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:28.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the,</v>

1024
00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:30.950
<v Speaker 2>and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he hones in on its relationship.</v>

1025
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:31.861
<v Speaker 2>Not Happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You love him,</v>

1026
00:44:31.861 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1027
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.110
<v Speaker 3>you don't really want to be with him </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

1028
00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:34.831
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1029
00:44:34.831 --> 00:44:36.450
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get your phone out,</v>

1030
00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.890
<v Speaker 3>but call him right now and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

1031
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.210
<v Speaker 3>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1032
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.810
<v Speaker 3>She's Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Laura Anthony Robbins.</v>

1033
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.910
<v Speaker 3>This is Tony in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the film he says Tony Robbins.</v>

1034
00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:50.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she calls the guy and he's at work or</v>

1035
00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:51.121
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1036
00:44:51.121 --> 00:44:51.960
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up honey?</v>

1037
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.620

<v Speaker 3>this is going to be really hard.</v>

1038
00:44:55.621 --> 00:44:59.040
<v Speaker 3>But in front of 3000 people in the chat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she dumps him on the phone.</v>

1039
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:00.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1044
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.713
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then Tony says you did the right </v>

1045
00:45:10.501 --> 00:45:10.921
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1046
00:45:10.921 --> 00:45:11.754
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how could you make that call not </v>

1047
00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:15.264
<v Speaker 3>knowing anything about that person's </v>
<v Speaker 3>past and not knowing their behavior </v>

1048
00:45:17.791 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 3>patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not knowing?</v>

1049
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:19.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1050
00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:22.590
<v Speaker 3>who is she when she's on that stage in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of 3000 people?</v>

1051
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Is She really herself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1052
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.420
<v Speaker 3>Because most people aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1053
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.273
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course not.</v>

1054
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:28.680
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I immediately want to know is,</v>

1055
00:45:28.681 --> 00:45:29.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two days later,</v>

1056
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:30.743
<v Speaker 3>I'm really sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems incredibly irresponsible to </v>

1057
00:45:34.201 --> 00:45:38.370
<v Speaker 3>get someone to break to have so little </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and to take someone on their</v>

1058
00:45:38.371 --> 00:45:39.204
<v Speaker 3>word at that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some people that the one </v>

1059
00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:43.170
<v Speaker 3>day for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll go,</v>

1060
00:45:43.171 --> 00:45:44.820
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't fucking do this anymore.</v>

1061
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:45.743
<v Speaker 3>I need to get out of my marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'll go to the bar and they'll </v>

1062
00:45:47.221 --> 00:45:48.054
<v Speaker 3>have a drink and they'll get crazy for </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a few minutes or an hour or </v>

1063
00:45:50.701 --> 00:45:54.090
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they'll drive home,</v>

1064
00:45:54.091 --> 00:45:55.860
<v Speaker 3>they'll listen to a song and then their </v>
<v Speaker 3>wife,</v>

1065
00:45:55.861 --> 00:45:57.480
<v Speaker 3>we'll send them a text and then they'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1066
00:45:57.481 --> 00:45:58.970
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1067
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.790
<v Speaker 3>Like why did I think that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why am I this?</v>

1068
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:05.850
<v Speaker 3>And then you realize like you were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>indulging a certain pattern of behavior.</v>

1069
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:06.803
<v Speaker 3>So how does he know that that woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't indulging a certain pattern or </v>

1070
00:46:08.851 --> 00:46:09.960
<v Speaker 3>behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does it.</v>

1071
00:46:09.961 --> 00:46:11.400
<v Speaker 3>He can't possibly know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>

1072
00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:12.234
<v Speaker 3>may be she's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really stuck and maybe it was really a </v>

1073
00:46:16.111 --> 00:46:18.010
<v Speaker 3>good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't know.</v>

1074
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:18.930
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might,</v>

1075
00:46:18.931 --> 00:46:22.170
<v Speaker 3>he might have given her awesome advice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he fucking for sure didn't know that</v>

1076
00:46:22.171 --> 00:46:23.070
<v Speaker 3>it was awesome advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1077
00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:23.904
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1078
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:25.950
<v Speaker 3>And that's the problem with all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs,</v>

1079
00:46:25.951 --> 00:46:27.920
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Aa in a,</v>

1080
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:30.180
<v Speaker 3>does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't collect data or if they do,</v>

1081
00:46:30.181 --> 00:46:32.190
<v Speaker 3>they don't make it public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't get the data.</v>

1082
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.473
<v Speaker 3>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what percentage of people that come and </v>

1083
00:46:35.041 --> 00:46:35.874
<v Speaker 3>last this many weeks or months and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>percentage never take a drink or take </v>

1084
00:46:38.911 --> 00:46:40.800
<v Speaker 3>one drink or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

1085
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:41.491
<v Speaker 3>No one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1086
00:46:41.491 --> 00:46:43.530
<v Speaker 3>we have at the anecdotes like I went and</v>
<v Speaker 3>worked for me.</v>

1087
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:44.363
<v Speaker 3>I went didn't work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well which is it wasn't there a recent </v>

1088
00:46:48.031 --> 00:46:51.950
<v Speaker 3>study on Aa where they were determining </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people who,</v>

1089
00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:52.963
<v Speaker 3>who leave the pro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to find out if you see if you </v>

1090
00:46:55.921 --> 00:46:56.850
<v Speaker 3>could find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was a,</v>

1091
00:46:56.851 --> 00:46:57.684
<v Speaker 3>it was a recent study that was talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about sobriety and maintaining sobriety </v>

1092
00:47:01.561 --> 00:47:04.120
<v Speaker 3>and how little of an impact than it </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually had.</v>

1093
00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:08.250
<v Speaker 3>It did have an impact on people </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintaining sobriety and they think that</v>

1094
00:47:08.251 --> 00:47:09.084
<v Speaker 3>that impact may have been connected to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sort of sponsor system that they </v>

1095
00:47:14.161 --> 00:47:14.994
<v Speaker 3>have and not wanting to disappoint </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and camaraderie that you develop </v>

1096
00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:21.360
<v Speaker 3>in that sobriety environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which makes a lot of sense.</v>

1097
00:47:21.361 --> 00:47:24.870
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's really a clever how </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've structured it in that way.</v>

1098
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:27.900
<v Speaker 3>Cause I think like having a mentor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having someone's already done it.</v>

1099
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also I think a big part</v>

1100
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.850
<v Speaker 1>of what leads people to alcoholism </v>
<v Speaker 1>besides,</v>

1101
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:34.684
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genetic markers and all the </v>

1102
00:47:35.561 --> 00:47:39.820
<v Speaker 1>different things where people have like </v>
<v Speaker 1>an inclination to do it is um,</v>

1103
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.983
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1104
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:44.290
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to medicate themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to,</v>

1105
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:45.124
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things is they're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to medicate themselves from a lack of </v>

1106
00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:52.900
<v Speaker 1>companionship or lack of good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful interaction with people.</v>

1107
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.300
<v Speaker 1>And when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1108
00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:58.240
<v Speaker 1>you're situation is on the line and sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a dire way like,</v>

1109
00:47:58.241 --> 00:48:00.160
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit fucking rock bottom.</v>

1110
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.010
<v Speaker 1>We're throwing this booze and the trash </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're getting your shit together.</v>

1111
00:48:03.011 --> 00:48:05.440
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fall a 12 step program </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and you're going to do all it.</v>

1112
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Now all sudden there's some urgency </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

1113
00:48:07.931 --> 00:48:09.940
<v Speaker 1>And you have someone who you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>accountable to.</v>

1114
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:12.370
<v Speaker 1>You have to call this person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going getting a chip,</v>

1115
00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:13.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1116
00:48:13.001 --> 00:48:14.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm 90 days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1117
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.570
<v Speaker 1>congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You made it to 90 days.</v>

1118
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:18.310
<v Speaker 1>And then you go up there and give a </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

1119
00:48:18.311 --> 00:48:21.190
<v Speaker 1>So you get all this attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which people said desperately crave.</v>

1120
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.190
<v Speaker 1>You get to be on a podium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's looking at you.</v>

1121
00:48:24.191 --> 00:48:28.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot involved in it that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just about sobriety,</v>

1122
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:29.890
<v Speaker 1>about ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

1123
00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.470
<v Speaker 1>very social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very social and it,</v>

1124
00:48:32.471 --> 00:48:34.090
<v Speaker 1>and it could be that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>

1125
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.300
<v Speaker 1>they figured it out over the decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely got something right.</v>

1126
00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.360
<v Speaker 1>But there was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1127
00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that was stuck,</v>

1128
00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:43.110
<v Speaker 1>the study was showing how little of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect it is a,</v>

1129
00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:45.790
<v Speaker 1>it's a really kind of amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does have an effect,</v>

1130
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:49.210
<v Speaker 1>but the effect is not that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than people that just quit.</v>

1131
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:50.463
<v Speaker 1>Like I've known a couple people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not involved in any sort of 12 step </v>

1132
00:48:52.841 --> 00:48:54.880
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my good Buddy Greg Fitzsimmons,</v>

1133
00:48:55.270 --> 00:49:00.270
<v Speaker 1>he and I have been friends for something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 27 or 28 years.</v>

1134
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:01.563
<v Speaker 1>We met as rookie standup comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started like within a week of each </v>

1135
00:49:04.031 --> 00:49:05.590
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I met him,</v>

1136
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.510
<v Speaker 1>he was 22,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe at the time.</v>

1137
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:08.553
<v Speaker 1>And he had just quit drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He realized like his parents had issues </v>

1138
00:49:11.561 --> 00:49:14.140
<v Speaker 1>with substance abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a young man,</v>

1139
00:49:14.141 --> 00:49:14.974
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1140
00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I can't fucking do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1141
00:49:16.541 --> 00:49:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting hammered all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I got the bug,</v>

1142
00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.070
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

1143
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And never drank again right here.</v>

1144
00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.193
<v Speaker 1>Like literally never drank again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His whole life to this day hasn't dried </v>

1145
00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.070
<v Speaker 1>and is super successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emmy Award winning writer,</v>

1146
00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:32.530
<v Speaker 1>all these people will still tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1147
00:49:32.531 --> 00:49:33.364
<v Speaker 1>you need to get an a program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right because you're an alcohol ride </v>

1148
00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:36.733
<v Speaker 1>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the disease model of alcoholism </v>

1149
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:43.390
<v Speaker 1>that's bothersome because it's really a </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral choice or behavioral problem.</v>

1150
00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:46.600
<v Speaker 1>But if you treat it like a disease that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the debt,</v>

1151
00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.360
<v Speaker 1>the good side of that is that it got </v>
<v Speaker 1>people off the,</v>

1152
00:49:49.361 --> 00:49:50.560
<v Speaker 1>you're just weak willed.</v>

1153
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1154
00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:52.970
<v Speaker 1>and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your product.</v>

1155
00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Don't know it isn't bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't.</v>

1156
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.830
<v Speaker 1>It isn't like cancer either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1157
00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:00.280
<v Speaker 1>oh I'm sorry you got cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry you have the alcoholic gene or</v>

1158
00:50:00.281 --> 00:50:01.114
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause clearly like your friend and </v>

1159
00:50:03.371 --> 00:50:05.320
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people like that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just quit.</v>

1160
00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:06.183
<v Speaker 1>They are able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also from the scientific </v>

1161
00:50:08.381 --> 00:50:10.600
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have much data because we don't</v>

1162
00:50:10.601 --> 00:50:11.800
<v Speaker 1>know who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1163
00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:14.080
<v Speaker 1>They just quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't go through a program and then</v>

1164
00:50:14.081 --> 00:50:17.860
<v Speaker 1>we have them in our database and we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they did and how long they came and</v>

1165
00:50:17.861 --> 00:50:19.060
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1166
00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:20.163
<v Speaker 1>does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way to know is to really get </v>

1167
00:50:21.971 --> 00:50:24.370
<v Speaker 1>more data on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we just don't have enough,</v>

1168
00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:26.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from those kinds of groups that do that.</v>

1169
00:50:26.681 --> 00:50:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Like Aa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are</v>

1170
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.980
<v Speaker 3>academics who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists who study addiction,</v>

1171
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:31.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

1172
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.890
<v Speaker 3>they tell me that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1173
00:50:33.891 --> 00:50:35.960
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the addict to take a single drink,</v>

1174
00:50:35.961 --> 00:50:37.070
<v Speaker 3>what's the harm?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to have a drink.</v>

1175
00:50:37.090 --> 00:50:38.210
<v Speaker 3>You're at the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social,</v>

1176
00:50:38.211 --> 00:50:39.044
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's much harder for them to not </v>

1177
00:50:40.791 --> 00:50:41.750
<v Speaker 3>have the second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>third,</v>

1178
00:50:41.751 --> 00:50:45.560
<v Speaker 3>fourth and they go till they pass out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas I never drink till I pass out,</v>

1179
00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:47.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a long time anyway,</v>

1180
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:50.960
<v Speaker 3>since college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1181
00:50:50.961 --> 00:50:51.950
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1182
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:54.890
<v Speaker 3>it's like the determinism issue for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not an,</v>

1183
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.260
<v Speaker 3>it's not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a self control problem.</v>

1184
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the addict,</v>

1185
00:50:58.611 --> 00:51:01.970
<v Speaker 3>apparently the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain is rewired and they,</v>

1186
00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:04.970
<v Speaker 3>it's much harder for them to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have that second drink.</v>

1187
00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it rewiring thing or is it a </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic predisposition?</v>

1188
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Boeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's both.</v>

1189
00:51:10.071 --> 00:51:10.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably a,</v>

1190
00:51:10.861 --> 00:51:13.280
<v Speaker 3>a plethora of variables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1191
00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:16.220
<v Speaker 3>The contribute only the native American </v>
<v Speaker 3>population,</v>

1192
00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:17.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1193
00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:22.060
<v Speaker 3>the genetics are such that they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a stronger alcoholism problem,</v>

1194
00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:26.450
<v Speaker 3>which is exasperated by the poverty and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1195
00:51:26.451 --> 00:51:27.284
<v Speaker 3>all the other social issues that go with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and on these reservations and it </v>

1196
00:51:30.141 --> 00:51:31.010
<v Speaker 3>makes it even worse.</v>

1197
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:32.690
<v Speaker 3>But apparently there is a genetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>component.</v>

1198
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:36.110
<v Speaker 3>I would like to know if that's true </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I remember this discussion being</v>

1199
00:51:36.111 --> 00:51:36.944
<v Speaker 3>brought up before with someone else and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I looked it up and I found </v>

1200
00:51:38.991 --> 00:51:41.240
<v Speaker 3>something that had showed contrary </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence,</v>

1201
00:51:41.241 --> 00:51:42.100
<v Speaker 3>but oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1202
00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.033
<v Speaker 3>Anecdotally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of everybody who knows that story </v>

1203
00:51:46.641 --> 00:51:49.070
<v Speaker 3>knows that native.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we've always been told.</v>

1204
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Native Americans didn't have alcohol and</v>

1205
00:51:51.231 --> 00:51:54.350
<v Speaker 3>their history and like there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1206
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.270
<v Speaker 3>and I could be wrong on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't looked at that,</v>

1207
00:51:56.271 --> 00:51:59.180
<v Speaker 3>any of that data in decades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they could be old material now.</v>

1208
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.193
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jeans most certainly do get affected by </v>

1209
00:52:03.141 --> 00:52:03.974
<v Speaker 3>Diet and climate and where people evolve</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're where their ancestors came </v>

1210
00:52:08.931 --> 00:52:10.010
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1211
00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.470
<v Speaker 3>there was a study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1212
00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.580
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did I put?</v>

1213
00:52:13.581 --> 00:52:18.581
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted something today that made </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense why some people can follow a Vegan</v>

1214
00:52:20.151 --> 00:52:20.984
<v Speaker 3>Diet and be healthy in regards to Omega </v>
<v Speaker 3>threes is that if you come from a long </v>

1215
00:52:26.421 --> 00:52:27.254
<v Speaker 3>line of people who have followed a </v>
<v Speaker 3>predominantly vegetarian diet over the </v>

1216
00:52:30.891 --> 00:52:31.724
<v Speaker 3>course of over a hundred years or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the genetics start to evolve or change </v>

1217
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:37.904
<v Speaker 3>and adapt to his diet to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body produces more omega threes </v>

1218
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:42.680
<v Speaker 3>from different things.</v>

1219
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.780
<v Speaker 3>It was real recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1220
00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:45.530
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1221
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:48.440
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted it this afternoon or retweeted</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1222
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.950
<v Speaker 3>The troublesome thing about Aa is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the religious component,</v>

1223
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.280
<v Speaker 3>not so much you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to believe in God.</v>

1224
00:52:54.281 --> 00:52:54.671
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1225
00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:54.860
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1226
00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:56.780
<v Speaker 3>That's why they should supplement with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1227
00:52:56.781 --> 00:52:57.614
<v Speaker 3>It's more recent than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did I see something about Omega threes </v>

1228
00:52:59.901 --> 00:53:03.380
<v Speaker 3>may not be as healthy as we thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We believe that.</v>

1229
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:07.300
<v Speaker 3>I'd never know what that tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have enough time.</v>

1230
00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:08.143
<v Speaker 3>Science keeps changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She keeps that you're supposed to </v>

1231
00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:12.360
<v Speaker 3>believe in a higher power for aa to </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

1232
00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:13.630
<v Speaker 3>but that year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1233
00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:15.860
<v Speaker 3>in a much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more insidious way,</v>

1234
00:53:15.861 --> 00:53:17.630
<v Speaker 3>I think you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like a sinner.</v>

1235
00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:20.060
<v Speaker 3>You were an original center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are an alcoholic.</v>

1236
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:21.270
<v Speaker 3>Say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an ally.</v>

1237
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.030
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my name is Michael and I'm an alcoholic.</v>

1238
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:24.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like the born again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1239
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm a sinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was born</v>

1240
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.660
<v Speaker 2>sinful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I accept Jesus.</v>

1241
00:53:27.661 --> 00:53:32.250
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't it be better to say in my name </v>
<v Speaker 2>is Michael Shermer and I am a free man.</v>

1242
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.330
<v Speaker 2>I liked him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1243
00:53:34.331 --> 00:53:35.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1244
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trapped by any sort of a drug or</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol that would be more empowering.</v>

1245
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:40.303
<v Speaker 2>Seems way better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that would be the Tony Robbins </v>

1246
00:53:42.121 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 2>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can change it.</v>

1247
00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.753
<v Speaker 2>So it's thrown sidekicks and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just see the thing that happened </v>

1248
00:53:46.981 --> 00:53:50.840
<v Speaker 2>with Tony Robbins recently where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had one of those coal walk firewall,</v>

1249
00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:54.830
<v Speaker 2>but these assholes were taking selfies </v>
<v Speaker 2>while they were firewalking and they put</v>

1250
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:56.730
<v Speaker 2>their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1251
00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:00.480
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe he's still does the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fireworks.</v>

1252
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:01.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it's a little risky.</v>

1253
00:54:01.681 --> 00:54:04.830
<v Speaker 2>I've done it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did it once for a Fox TV show.</v>

1254
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:06.023
<v Speaker 2>And first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a hard time finding any place to </v>

1255
00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:10.200
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you did it as a skeptic to prove.</v>

1256
00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:12.720
<v Speaker 2>Explain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well explain the whole I wanted,</v>

1257
00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:14.580
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what the experience is like.</v>

1258
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:17.340
<v Speaker 2>And then second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the explanation?</v>

1259
00:54:17.341 --> 00:54:18.940
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it your feet don't get burnt?</v>

1260
00:54:18.941 --> 00:54:19.774
<v Speaker 2>Like in one of the shows we actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>strapped raw steaks to my feet and you </v>

1261
00:54:24.431 --> 00:54:26.430
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then walked across the coals and you</v>

1262
00:54:26.431 --> 00:54:28.380
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stakes didn't get burned if you just</v>

1263
00:54:28.381 --> 00:54:29.214
<v Speaker 2>walk quickly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So either dead meat is conscious and </v>

1264
00:54:32.161 --> 00:54:35.790
<v Speaker 2>thinking positive thoughts or it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with positive thoughts.</v>

1265
00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Didn't get cooked at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1266
00:54:37.591 --> 00:54:38.424
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you move fairly quickly that </v>

1267
00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:42.900
<v Speaker 2>the conductance of the heat is very slow</v>
<v Speaker 2>with wood.</v>

1268
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:44.063
<v Speaker 2>So the analogy is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put your turn the oven up to 450 </v>

1269
00:54:46.441 --> 00:54:49.200
<v Speaker 2>degrees and you put a cake in and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>let it sit there for a while.</v>

1270
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:52.140
<v Speaker 2>You open the pay and you put your hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the air is 450 degrees,</v>

1271
00:54:52.141 --> 00:54:53.220
<v Speaker 2>but you don't get burnt.</v>

1272
00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:56.910
<v Speaker 2>You touch the cake and it's 450 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get burnt.</v>

1273
00:54:56.911 --> 00:54:57.744
<v Speaker 2>But you touch the cake pan or the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>metal part of the oven and you're burnt </v>

1274
00:55:00.781 --> 00:55:03.720
<v Speaker 2>almost instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The temperature is all the same.</v>

1275
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:04.583
<v Speaker 2>It's the heat conductivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is how quickly a material Trans </v>

1276
00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Duce as heat from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from it to you,</v>

1277
00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:14.400
<v Speaker 2>which is why we cook on steel versus the</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual Cole's themselves.</v>

1278
00:55:14.401 --> 00:55:15.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1279
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:15.833
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the Cole's or a poor conductor </v>

1280
00:55:16.681 --> 00:55:17.970
<v Speaker 2>of heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1281
00:55:17.971 --> 00:55:19.170
<v Speaker 2>so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1282
00:55:19.171 --> 00:55:23.110
<v Speaker 2>but the PR,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing with firewalking is this,</v>

1283
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:25.710
<v Speaker 2>you won't get burned if the bed is </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1284
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:28.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no longer than about 10 to 15 feet.</v>

1285
00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:30.173
<v Speaker 2>Eight feet is better and you have maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>a flat of grass that's wet on either </v>

1286
00:55:34.561 --> 00:55:35.394
<v Speaker 2>side so that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the temperature of the bottom of your </v>

1287
00:55:37.351 --> 00:55:40.110
<v Speaker 2>feet is a little bit cooler and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>traipse across,</v>

1288
00:55:40.111 --> 00:55:41.990
<v Speaker 2>don't stop to take selfies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big mistakes.</v>

1289
00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you go above 15 to 20 feet,</v>

1290
00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:46.793
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heat's going to start to build up </v>

1291
00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:49.693
<v Speaker 2>and there you can get burned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my guess is what happened with was </v>

1292
00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:53.940
<v Speaker 2>his people is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a short,</v>

1293
00:55:53.941 --> 00:55:54.960
<v Speaker 2>probably a short bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1294
00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:58.230
<v Speaker 2>but probably they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't scoot across fairly quickly.</v>

1295
00:55:58.231 --> 00:56:00.630
<v Speaker 2>The two times I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an eight foot bed.</v>

1296
00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:01.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mess around.</v>

1297
00:56:01.981 --> 00:56:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just plowed right across.</v>

1298
00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:07.470
<v Speaker 2>It's very anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1299
00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Is there a fun there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1300
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:12.630
<v Speaker 2>these people are so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you Google Michael Shermer fire walk,</v>

1301
00:56:12.631 --> 00:56:14.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a video that's a very short </v>
<v Speaker 2>little firewatch,</v>

1302
00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.490
<v Speaker 2>very short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to the see the flames on the side,</v>

1303
00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.700
<v Speaker 2>they put wood on there after it's burned</v>
<v Speaker 2>for hours and hours,</v>

1304
00:56:20.701 --> 00:56:21.900
<v Speaker 2>and then they put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1305
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.250
<v Speaker 2>like cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the flames</v>

1306
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:26.800
<v Speaker 3>are coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from it from an angle,</v>

1307
00:56:26.801 --> 00:56:29.020
<v Speaker 3>it makes it look like you're almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking through the flames,</v>

1308
00:56:29.021 --> 00:56:31.060
<v Speaker 3>which you're not what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of in some ways,</v>

1309
00:56:31.061 --> 00:56:33.650
<v Speaker 3>like kind of a rite of passage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that passage or something.</v>

1310
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:34.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1311
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.370
<v Speaker 3>it's what you're doing is like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ritualistic thing.</v>

1312
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a metaphor.</v>

1313
00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:40.120
<v Speaker 3>It's a metaphor for accomplishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1314
00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really doesn't mean anything.</v>

1315
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is when,</v>

1316
00:56:43.541 --> 00:56:44.374
<v Speaker 3>you know what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that metaphor is not going to </v>

1317
00:56:46.361 --> 00:56:47.194
<v Speaker 3>fucking work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he just ruined all of this stuff is </v>

1318
00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.780
<v Speaker 3>all the people that could have possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten over the hump.</v>

1319
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:55.510
<v Speaker 3>Now that you've ruined it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Shermer,</v>

1320
00:56:55.511 --> 00:56:56.320
<v Speaker 3>how dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1321
00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:56.951
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1322
00:56:56.951 --> 00:56:58.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1323
00:56:58.301 --> 00:56:59.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to know how does it work?</v>

1324
00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.251
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1325
00:57:00.251 --> 00:57:01.960
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he had a bed of metal,</v>

1326
00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:02.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one would,</v>

1327
00:57:02.711 --> 00:57:03.430
<v Speaker 3>could walk on it.</v>

1328
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even Tony Robbins,</v>

1329
00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:05.554
<v Speaker 3>no matter how positive he was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So dead wood coals is a poor conductor </v>

1330
00:57:10.481 --> 00:57:11.200
<v Speaker 3>of heat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1331
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.580
<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1332
00:57:12.581 --> 00:57:14.950
<v Speaker 3>That makes a ton of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why,</v>

1333
00:57:14.951 --> 00:57:16.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have a grill,</v>

1334
00:57:16.241 --> 00:57:17.074
<v Speaker 3>you put the coals down and then you put </v>
<v Speaker 3>that steel grate over the grill steels </v>

1335
00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:22.370
<v Speaker 3>and excellent ends up through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1336
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:23.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why we choose certain metals </v>

1337
00:57:24.791 --> 00:57:26.530
<v Speaker 3>as well to cook in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1338
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:27.940
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1339
00:57:27.941 --> 00:57:30.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm amazed he could get insurance for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this because people do get burned.</v>

1340
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:32.230
<v Speaker 3>And the ones we did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1341
00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:34.990
<v Speaker 3>some of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people had little blisters because</v>

1342
00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:35.883
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've,</v>

1343
00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:38.120
<v Speaker 3>if you've walked slowly or you have 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1344
00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:38.973
<v Speaker 3>I'd go beg for it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have pretty good callouses on the </v>

1345
00:57:40.511 --> 00:57:42.130
<v Speaker 3>bottom of my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you don't,</v>

1346
00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:43.053
<v Speaker 3>you know that then your skin is thinner </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's temperature builds up faster </v>

1347
00:57:46.271 --> 00:57:48.220
<v Speaker 3>for that and you're quite likely to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>the blisters,</v>

1348
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.010
<v Speaker 3>especially if you get pedicures and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd put moisture on your,</v>

1349
00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:53.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're always like fear a tenderfoot.</v>

1350
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.890
<v Speaker 3>Literally that's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tenderfoot.</v>

1351
00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:57.760
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the cub scout thing,</v>

1352
00:57:57.761 --> 00:57:59.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tender foot and the beginning.</v>

1353
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:02.610
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a hilarious way to describe it.</v>

1354
00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:03.910
<v Speaker 3>With all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know it,</v>

1355
00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:06.370
<v Speaker 3>all things in moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the extreme isn't it?</v>

1356
00:58:06.371 --> 00:58:07.630
<v Speaker 3>Gets people in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1357
00:58:07.631 --> 00:58:11.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can never have a drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can never have a piece of meat.</v>

1358
00:58:11.111 --> 00:58:15.310
<v Speaker 3>You can never do this or that and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you go off the wagon,</v>

1359
00:58:15.311 --> 00:58:16.144
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then if you feel like a sinner and it's </v>

1360
00:58:17.651 --> 00:58:18.960
<v Speaker 3>back to that religious thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1361
00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:19.993
<v Speaker 3>sin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a bad person and that adds too </v>

1362
00:58:22.541 --> 00:58:23.111
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1363
00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:23.944
<v Speaker 3>negative emotional elements to behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're connecting all of these </v>

1364
00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:33.300
<v Speaker 3>ideologies to your behavior that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>very constrictive and very constricting,</v>

1365
00:58:34.691 --> 00:58:35.524
<v Speaker 3>and you're not allowed to deviate from </v>
<v Speaker 3>these plans and then you become a part </v>

1366
00:58:38.711 --> 00:58:40.180
<v Speaker 3>of this sort of team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1367
00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.360
<v Speaker 3>Like the people that are in crossfit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever,</v>

1368
00:58:42.361 --> 00:58:44.360
<v Speaker 3>have you ever met a crossfit person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the shots,</v>

1369
00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.840
<v Speaker 3>the workout of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1370
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:49.180
<v Speaker 3>And it's positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in shape,</v>

1371
00:58:49.181 --> 00:58:50.980
<v Speaker 3>they look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they look crazy.</v>

1372
00:58:50.981 --> 00:58:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Like they can't wait to go back and do </v>
<v Speaker 3>chin ups.</v>

1373
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:54.820
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they get out of their mind?</v>

1374
00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:57.880
<v Speaker 3>And it's a very beneficial thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong,</v>

1375
00:58:57.881 --> 00:58:58.714
<v Speaker 3>but there's a thing that people do when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they get a part of a team or a group or </v>

1376
00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:05.950
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're one of those now,</v>

1377
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:06.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1378
00:59:06.851 --> 00:59:09.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an ultra marathon runner right now.</v>

1379
00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:10.990
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in that group.</v>

1380
00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:11.893
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1381
00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:12.753
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just reviewed this book for The Wall </v>

1382
00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:14.793
<v Speaker 3>Street Journal and Cross fit training </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what it means to be fit now versus </v>

1383
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.240
<v Speaker 3>when I was in my twenties say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1384
00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:20.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back when Nautilus was,</v>

1385
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea was you're going to isolate the</v>

1386
00:59:23.781 --> 00:59:25.640
<v Speaker 2>muscle groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's like,</v>

1387
00:59:25.641 --> 00:59:26.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

1388
00:59:26.571 --> 00:59:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Isolate the muscle groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's authors line,</v>

1389
00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:30.860
<v Speaker 2>why is that good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoever where,</v>

1390
00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:31.753
<v Speaker 2>how did it ever get established that </v>
<v Speaker 2>isolating the muscle group is a good </v>

1391
00:59:33.921 --> 00:59:36.110
<v Speaker 2>thing and he shows that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free weights,</v>

1392
00:59:36.111 --> 00:59:39.080
<v Speaker 2>you're using all of your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every muscle tendon,</v>

1393
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:41.750
<v Speaker 2>just the balance and the move and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>

1394
00:59:41.751 --> 00:59:43.820
<v Speaker 2>It's much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I more,</v>

1395
00:59:43.821 --> 00:59:44.654
<v Speaker 2>I looked into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

1396
00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:47.530
<v Speaker 2>well of course this is when high </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools,</v>

1397
00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:50.360
<v Speaker 2>it started introducing physical educate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to go in the gym,</v>

1398
00:59:50.361 --> 00:59:51.194
<v Speaker 2>everybody's in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't turn loose thousands of </v>

1399
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:56.510
<v Speaker 2>teenage kids and free weight rooms and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not have injuries.</v>

1400
00:59:57.050 --> 00:59:57.883
<v Speaker 2>So the Nautilus machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the solution to isolate and no </v>

1401
00:59:59.991 --> 01:00:01.430
<v Speaker 2>one's going to get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can turn loose,</v>

1402
01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.264
<v Speaker 2>somebody does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't clean and jerk a big weight </v>

1403
01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:07.490
<v Speaker 2>and not have somebody explained how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it without getting hurt.</v>

1404
01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly true.</v>

1405
01:00:09.261 --> 01:00:10.094
<v Speaker 1>But I think the big aspect of it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like to make things more </v>

1406
01:00:14.181 --> 01:00:15.014
<v Speaker 1>complicated than they need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they always like to invent some new </v>

1407
01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:21.530
<v Speaker 1>way to do things and sometimes that new </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to do things looks awesome.</v>

1408
01:00:21.531 --> 01:00:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Like a Nautilus machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1409
01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:23.504
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have the big cam system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's tables and you get to the </v>

1410
01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>plates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put the pin in the plate and you get</v>

1411
01:00:28.401 --> 01:00:30.370
<v Speaker 1>to move it up and down and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1412
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.333
<v Speaker 1>I mean it looks amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as like it being beneficial </v>

1413
01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:35.384
<v Speaker 1>to promoting functional strength is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly as good as those like Olympic </v>

1414
01:00:39.111 --> 01:00:41.120
<v Speaker 1>lifts that people do like clean and </v>
<v Speaker 1>press.</v>

1415
01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.250
<v Speaker 1>But those are not that glamorous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1416
01:00:43.251 --> 01:00:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Those machines are very glamorous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1417
01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:46.293
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell people that you're </v>

1418
01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.920
<v Speaker 1>pulling the whole stack.</v>

1419
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got the whole stack,</v>

1420
01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.720
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be those isolating movements at one</v>

1421
01:00:53.721 --> 01:00:54.554
<v Speaker 1>point in time were thought to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best way to develop muscle because </v>

1422
01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.960
<v Speaker 1>they're really good for bodybuilding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1423
01:00:59.961 --> 01:01:04.640
<v Speaker 1>But there's a difference between like </v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone looks really good,</v>

1424
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>like there's certain looks that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve like giant biceps,</v>

1425
01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:09.164
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where they're completely out of balance </v>

1426
01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:12.590
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have like a little knack</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have no legs.</v>

1427
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:14.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not healthy,</v>

1428
01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:18.460
<v Speaker 1>but they want big biceps so they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep constantly doing referrals.</v>

1429
01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>So you can get like really out of whack </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing those sorts of exercises if you're</v>

1430
01:01:22.281 --> 01:01:27.050
<v Speaker 1>not careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to be a bodybuilder,</v>

1431
01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:27.913
<v Speaker 1>that was always the protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at how Arnold lifted </v>

1432
01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:31.263
<v Speaker 1>now a lot of these Franco Columbo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys like they were all in isolation </v>

1433
01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of different,</v>

1434
01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.033
<v Speaker 1>they did a lot of tricep extensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did a lot of things to pump those </v>

1435
01:01:39.951 --> 01:01:41.260
<v Speaker 1>muscles up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did,</v>

1436
01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squats and leg presses and stuff too.</v>

1437
01:01:43.911 --> 01:01:44.744
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of it was involving like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting specific muscle groups to </v>

1438
01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:50.330
<v Speaker 1>accentuate those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1439
01:01:50.331 --> 01:01:54.620
<v Speaker 1>But it's just wasn't the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people for a long time thought those</v>

1440
01:01:54.621 --> 01:01:56.750
<v Speaker 1>machines were the shit they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1441
01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>this is my cell,</v>

1442
01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.250
<v Speaker 2>Lucian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my review,</v>

1443
01:01:59.251 --> 01:02:02.700
<v Speaker 2>I wrote about this guy I met back in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>80s when I get into bike racing,</v>

1444
01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:06.030
<v Speaker 2>name filled grenache Shya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was Mister California bodybuilder.</v>

1445
01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:11.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1954 the year I was born and three of</v>

1446
01:02:11.331 --> 01:02:13.320
<v Speaker 2>the 50s and early sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

1447
01:02:13.321 --> 01:02:14.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just lifting weights.</v>

1448
01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.130
<v Speaker 2>Mr Bodybuilder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many Mehta cyclists and said,</v>

1449
01:02:17.131 --> 01:02:17.964
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you cut in San Francisco when </v>

1450
01:02:18.571 --> 01:02:19.404
<v Speaker 2>she come out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got the Sunday ride going up in the </v>

1451
01:02:20.791 --> 01:02:22.800
<v Speaker 2>local hills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh I'm going to kick their ass.</v>

1452
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Kicked your ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said he got dropped at the first hill,</v>

1453
01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.600
<v Speaker 2>they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you realize,</v>

1454
01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:28.890
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm not fit.</v>

1455
01:02:28.891 --> 01:02:29.724
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was mister t nine Miss California </v>

1456
01:02:31.141 --> 01:02:31.974
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also Mr fitness or the most fit </v>

1457
01:02:33.331 --> 01:02:35.850
<v Speaker 2>person in California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you realize I'm not fit.</v>

1458
01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I got no cardiovascular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1459
01:02:37.981 --> 01:02:40.470
<v Speaker 2>he took up cycling and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1460
01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this crossfit book,</v>

1461
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.070
<v Speaker 2>it was that these people are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>balanced.</v>

1462
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:45.090
<v Speaker 2>That was the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1463
01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Cause you don't even know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do for the competition.</v>

1464
01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:48.684
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You show up and it could be any one of </v>

1465
01:02:49.951 --> 01:02:53.070
<v Speaker 2>these different tasks so you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>more well rounded.</v>

1466
01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Well as opposed to I can lift this one </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular noddle is wait,</v>

1467
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:58.583
<v Speaker 2>I read something about crossfit taking a</v>
<v Speaker 2>critical role in our society that if </v>

1468
01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.393
<v Speaker 2>there was a comparison to crossfit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion and they were saying that </v>

1469
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:09.263
<v Speaker 2>essentially as people become more </v>
<v Speaker 2>secular and they move away from </v>

1470
01:03:11.731 --> 01:03:12.564
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gravitate towards things like </v>

1471
01:03:14.101 --> 01:03:14.934
<v Speaker 2>crossfit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give him this sort of sense of </v>

1472
01:03:15.931 --> 01:03:16.764
<v Speaker 2>community and shared experience and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like uncommon shared experience because </v>

1473
01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:25.680
<v Speaker 2>the average person you go to work and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you got cows that are bleeding.</v>

1474
01:03:25.681 --> 01:03:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did my workout of the day to day.</v>

1475
01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:28.733
<v Speaker 2>Like just something like separates Mike </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the pack as he passes the break </v>

1476
01:03:32.151 --> 01:03:32.350
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

1477
01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:36.510
<v Speaker 2>Like Mike's fucking crazy doing chin ups</v>
<v Speaker 2>every morning at 6:00</v>

1478
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:37.343
<v Speaker 2>AM when a bunch of other assholes down </v>
<v Speaker 2>on supple va at the crossfit center and </v>

1479
01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:41.923
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get this feeling like I belong to </v>

1480
01:03:43.741 --> 01:03:44.574
<v Speaker 2>this group of unusual people doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>unusual things and it's a social </v>

1481
01:03:48.541 --> 01:03:49.710
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also that's,</v>

1482
01:03:49.711 --> 01:03:52.020
<v Speaker 2>well that's what religions do and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1483
01:03:52.021 --> 01:03:52.854
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's our group here and we're meeting </v>

1484
01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:56.340
<v Speaker 2>once a week or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we had these rituals.</v>

1485
01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.500
<v Speaker 2>It's all like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very attractive to people.</v>

1486
01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Those things vary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a book called Bowling alone,</v>

1487
01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:05.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by sociologists that it sort of tracking</v>

1488
01:04:05.731 --> 01:04:09.300
<v Speaker 2>the decline of social things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullying,</v>

1489
01:04:09.301 --> 01:04:10.260
<v Speaker 2>bully leagues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1490
01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:12.443
<v Speaker 2>very many bowling leagues anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But more and more things like that were </v>

1491
01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.850
<v Speaker 2>more isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do our own thing and your computer at</v>

1492
01:04:17.851 --> 01:04:20.040
<v Speaker 2>home or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that this is actually,</v>

1493
01:04:20.041 --> 01:04:21.930
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing to get out there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a community,</v>

1494
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:23.310
<v Speaker 2>but as always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1495
01:04:23.311 --> 01:04:25.050
<v Speaker 2>it's the extremism that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1496
01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:27.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do this six hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy.</v>

1497
01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:30.240
<v Speaker 2>This guy failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're now,</v>

1498
01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:31.074
<v Speaker 2>she ended up dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He ended up dying early because he just </v>

1499
01:04:32.701 --> 01:04:35.640
<v Speaker 2>worked out like eight hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He keeled over dead in his gym.</v>

1500
01:04:35.641 --> 01:04:37.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the cause is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>

1501
01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1502
01:04:38.431 --> 01:04:38.761
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1503
01:04:38.761 --> 01:04:39.594
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like God he used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had this workout routine that he had </v>

1504
01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:43.374
<v Speaker 2>a like a $5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge that anybody that could match </v>

1505
01:04:45.451 --> 01:04:46.284
<v Speaker 2>him for the 45 minute workout routine in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his home gym and Olympic cyclist would </v>

1506
01:04:49.831 --> 01:04:50.664
<v Speaker 2>come and all these super steadily guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>and no one ever made it cause it was so </v>

1507
01:04:53.791 --> 01:04:56.430
<v Speaker 2>specialized for just what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1508
01:04:56.431 --> 01:05:00.540
<v Speaker 2>like one arm chin ups or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one arm pushups or you know,</v>

1509
01:05:00.541 --> 01:05:01.374
<v Speaker 2>the stairmaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He built his own stair master before </v>

1510
01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.160
<v Speaker 2>anyone had stair masters and he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1511
01:05:05.161 --> 01:05:05.994
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just crank it up at such a high level </v>

1512
01:05:07.351 --> 01:05:08.700
<v Speaker 2>that you just can't do it.</v>

1513
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:13.710
<v Speaker 2>And that's all he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was He fit,</v>

1514
01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was he healthy fit?</v>

1515
01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well up to the point where your dad,</v>

1516
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:20.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably an argument for once you</v>

1517
01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.313
<v Speaker 2>die from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're probably not doing it </v>

1518
01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:25.190
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to ride around Orange County and</v>

1519
01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:28.810
<v Speaker 2>he'd go see that lady out there Sunday </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning getting her papers,</v>

1520
01:05:28.811 --> 01:05:29.740
<v Speaker 2>cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee,</v>

1521
01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.230
<v Speaker 2>donut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going to check out early.</v>

1522
01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.210
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1523
01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:36.070
<v Speaker 2>that chick's probably still pissing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>his grave.</v>

1524
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:40.330
<v Speaker 2>There's only so much we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She shows up every morning.</v>

1525
01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:42.123
<v Speaker 2>I just reviewed this a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another book for Wall Street Journal </v>

1526
01:05:43.931 --> 01:05:46.390
<v Speaker 2>called why men age about aging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we know,</v>

1527
01:05:46.391 --> 01:05:48.040
<v Speaker 2>and we know a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

1528
01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:51.850
<v Speaker 2>there's also know there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only so much you can do.</v>

1529
01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:54.610
<v Speaker 2>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it just men?</v>

1530
01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy was teeth.</v>

1531
01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:59.060
<v Speaker 2>He's a doc who treats men for Jesus.</v>

1532
01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.280
<v Speaker 2>There's also a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1533
01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:04.000
<v Speaker 2>there are some differences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's,</v>

1534
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:04.893
<v Speaker 2>I think from a marketing perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's already a bunch of books up </v>

1535
01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:10.120
<v Speaker 2>for women on aging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not much about men.</v>

1536
01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:11.580
<v Speaker 2>But that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

1537
01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:14.200
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really matter because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really all the same process.</v>

1538
01:06:14.201 --> 01:06:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your telomers we'll get you and the idea</v>

1539
01:06:17.511 --> 01:06:17.681
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1540
01:06:17.681 --> 01:06:20.260
<v Speaker 2>we live twice as long as our ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 2>did a century ago,</v>

1541
01:06:20.261 --> 01:06:20.831
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1542
01:06:20.831 --> 01:06:21.664
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But really no one's living above 120 </v>

1543
01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:24.963
<v Speaker 2>just more and more people are pushing up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the upper ceiling because of public </v>

1544
01:06:27.731 --> 01:06:30.910
<v Speaker 2>health and just general stuff we do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes us healthier.</v>

1545
01:06:30.911 --> 01:06:31.744
<v Speaker 2>But in terms of longevity and aging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't stop it as you can do is kind </v>

1546
01:06:34.821 --> 01:06:39.380
<v Speaker 2>of hopefully slow it down a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you want to have a higher quality of</v>

1547
01:06:39.381 --> 01:06:40.214
<v Speaker 2>life the further up you go as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>lying in bed with tubes for the last 10 </v>

1548
01:06:44.471 --> 01:06:45.790
<v Speaker 2>years of your life or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1549
01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:48.070
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the future research is,</v>

1550
01:06:48.071 --> 01:06:49.540
<v Speaker 2>where the breakthroughs will come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

1551
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:52.930
<v Speaker 2>not radical life extension lists that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've also written about.</v>

1552
01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:55.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have 500 years there.</v>

1553
01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Schermer don't you want to live 500 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>

1554
01:06:56.570 --> 01:06:57.403
<v Speaker 2>Like look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get me to 90 without Alzheimer's </v>

1555
01:06:59.501 --> 01:07:00.334
<v Speaker 2>and cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1556
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.970
<v Speaker 2>let's just start one decade at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just easy,</v>

1557
01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:06.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

1558
01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:06.953
<v Speaker 2>the problems are really complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the quality of life thing that </v>

1559
01:07:09.581 --> 01:07:11.380
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important things.</v>

1560
01:07:11.381 --> 01:07:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I have this phrase that I've said </v>
<v Speaker 2>many times,</v>

1561
01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:17.110
<v Speaker 2>but I'm gonna say it cause it fits right</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1562
01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.930
<v Speaker 2>We all love to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everyone's afraid to die.</v>

1563
01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:23.770
<v Speaker 2>We love to shut off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we love to shut off at night.</v>

1564
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Everybody loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we look forward to it.</v>

1565
01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:30.130
<v Speaker 2>But that one big shutoff when you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming back is just too fucked up.</v>

1566
01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:32.440
<v Speaker 2>It's just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1567
01:07:32.441 --> 01:07:33.610
<v Speaker 2>here it's thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's inevitable.</v>

1568
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.380
<v Speaker 2>This is my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my next book,</v>

1569
01:07:35.381 --> 01:07:36.500
<v Speaker 2>I have a chapter called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1570
01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.633
<v Speaker 2>afterlife for atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are not just the radical life </v>

1571
01:07:40.241 --> 01:07:43.040
<v Speaker 2>extension is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the p the mine up loaders and,</v>

1572
01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:44.141
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1573
01:07:44.141 --> 01:07:46.960
<v Speaker 2>you're going to scan your connectome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it in a computer,</v>

1574
01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:47.973
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll wake up in the computer like </v>

1575
01:07:49.001 --> 01:07:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Depp in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the problem.</v>

1576
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:54.160
<v Speaker 2>When you go to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you wake up tomorrow,</v>

1577
01:07:54.161 --> 01:07:56.840
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're groggy for a few minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you're,</v>

1578
01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.000
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're back.</v>

1579
01:07:58.001 --> 01:07:58.834
<v Speaker 2>You still feel like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a continuity between today and </v>

1580
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.240
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow or you get general anesthesia </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery.</v>

1581
01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.163
<v Speaker 2>You wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're groggy or for a little bit </v>

1582
01:08:06.521 --> 01:08:08.350
<v Speaker 2>longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the continuity comes back.</v>

1583
01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:10.690
<v Speaker 2>It's still you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>

1584
01:08:10.691 --> 01:08:11.524
<v Speaker 2>is if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you die and we have a scan of your </v>

1585
01:08:14.561 --> 01:08:17.810
<v Speaker 2>connectome and we put it in a computer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and turn it on.</v>

1586
01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to wake up in the computer</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you did from sleep then?</v>

1587
01:08:21.921 --> 01:08:25.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would just be a copy of your,</v>

1588
01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:26.323
<v Speaker 2>if this could ever be done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very unlikely because it's </v>

1589
01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.260
<v Speaker 2>super hard problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just say it could.</v>

1590
01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.513
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a break in continuity </v>

1591
01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.230
<v Speaker 2>from death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dead.</v>

1592
01:08:36.231 --> 01:08:39.050
<v Speaker 2>That's it and this thing we have is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>copy of you.</v>

1593
01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:44.170
<v Speaker 2>It would be like if we cloned your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you die and then we reconstruct</v>

1594
01:08:44.211 --> 01:08:46.730
<v Speaker 2>the body and there you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not you.</v>

1595
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Not first person through the eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

1596
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:51.260
<v Speaker 2>it's just a copy of me,</v>

1597
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.943
<v Speaker 1>devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was going to play devil's advocate </v>

1598
01:08:54.421 --> 01:08:55.254
<v Speaker 1>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would say is with our current </v>

1599
01:08:56.581 --> 01:08:59.700
<v Speaker 1>understanding and abilities right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're correct.</v>

1600
01:09:00.150 --> 01:09:03.330
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever we have right now,</v>

1601
01:09:03.331 --> 01:09:04.164
<v Speaker 1>whatever we are right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can understand it down to the </v>

1602
01:09:09.511 --> 01:09:12.960
<v Speaker 1>subatomic particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can literally go understand you as</v>

1603
01:09:12.961 --> 01:09:15.450
<v Speaker 1>a person like you as you stand right </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1604
01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:16.284
<v Speaker 1>September 15th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2016 if we can understand every single </v>

1605
01:09:21.721 --> 01:09:24.060
<v Speaker 1>aspect of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including consciousness,</v>

1606
01:09:24.061 --> 01:09:24.894
<v Speaker 1>we're not there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's a lot of debates and </v>

1607
01:09:26.431 --> 01:09:29.820
<v Speaker 1>does a lot of the struggles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're looking at it in terms of what</v>

1608
01:09:29.821 --> 01:09:30.654
<v Speaker 1>our current understanding is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we looked at it in terms of the </v>

1609
01:09:32.881 --> 01:09:33.714
<v Speaker 1>understanding of people that lived in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the year 100 and it would be a </v>

1610
01:09:38.131 --> 01:09:41.640
<v Speaker 1>completely different idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities,</v>

1611
01:09:41.730 --> 01:09:42.563
<v Speaker 1>like our possibilities today are </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly expensive in comparison to </v>

1612
01:09:46.231 --> 01:09:48.990
<v Speaker 1>people that lived in 1776.</v>

1613
01:09:49.230 --> 01:09:50.063
<v Speaker 1>Just the idea of what we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we understand about what it means </v>

1614
01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:56.640
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about atoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules.</v>

1615
01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1616
01:09:57.550 --> 01:09:59.080
<v Speaker 1>the idea of Telenor is all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1617
01:09:59.190 --> 01:10:02.820
<v Speaker 1>all the knowledge that we have today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that expanding exponentially for</v>

1618
01:10:02.821 --> 01:10:07.800
<v Speaker 1>the next 500 a thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that if we get to</v>

1619
01:10:07.801 --> 01:10:11.700
<v Speaker 1>that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can recreate reality to a point where</v>

1620
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.590
<v Speaker 1>I have a theory about people and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>composed this completely unqualified and</v>

1621
01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:21.150
<v Speaker 1>don't listen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's entirely possible that,</v>

1622
01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:25.740
<v Speaker 1>you know how bees make honey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people might make the universe.</v>

1623
01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it's entirely possible that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way the universe makes itself,</v>

1624
01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.760
<v Speaker 1>it makes a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes a monkey.</v>

1625
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:34.500
<v Speaker 1>The monkey eventually figures out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1626
01:10:34.501 --> 01:10:37.950
<v Speaker 1>a way to not get eaten by leopards and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the smart ones become a monkey.</v>

1627
01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:38.933
<v Speaker 1>And then they figure out shelter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they figured out agriculture and </v>

1628
01:10:41.341 --> 01:10:42.330
<v Speaker 1>then they really get going.</v>

1629
01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:43.253
<v Speaker 1>And once they really get going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they start doing is creating </v>

1630
01:10:44.821 --> 01:10:45.654
<v Speaker 1>technology that wait in the form of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheel on the form of a bucket to carry </v>

1631
01:10:48.841 --> 01:10:49.674
<v Speaker 1>the water so they don't have to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking out of the river and getting </v>

1632
01:10:50.971 --> 01:10:51.804
<v Speaker 1>crocodiles and fucking Giardia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's dying from in inborn </v>

1633
01:10:55.231 --> 01:10:57.450
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We figure things out slowly but surely.</v>

1634
01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:58.433
<v Speaker 1>And along the way they make better and </v>
<v Speaker 1>better things until they develop </v>

1635
01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:03.024
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until they develop artificial </v>

1636
01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:08.430
<v Speaker 1>intelligence to make something that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>think for itself.</v>

1637
01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:13.080
<v Speaker 1>And then they put that thing to work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing gets better in two weeks than</v>

1638
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.780
<v Speaker 1>thousand years of human development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1639
01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:16.853
<v Speaker 1>And I think that thing probably is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe gets created that the </v>

1640
01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:22.194
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this idea that the universe has no </v>

1641
01:11:23.701 --> 01:11:27.420
<v Speaker 1>beginning and no end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's his infinite cycle of maybe,</v>

1642
01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:32.040
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it does that through people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it makes people and in our through</v>

1643
01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.770
<v Speaker 1>through intelligence of some kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of intelligence.</v>

1644
01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:37.740
<v Speaker 1>But what we currently understand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>know of the known universe,</v>

1645
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.000
<v Speaker 1>we're the only ones that we know of and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at what we're doing.</v>

1646
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:41.551
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1647
01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:42.091
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1648
01:11:42.091 --> 01:11:42.924
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1649
01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.670
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are we,</v>

1650
01:11:44.671 --> 01:11:46.590
<v Speaker 1>where are we going with this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can just going to keep going.</v>

1651
01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Like when Elon Musk start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence,</v>

1652
01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:51.133
<v Speaker 1>who's one of the most important and </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular and famous technology </v>

1653
01:11:56.551 --> 01:11:57.384
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasts starts talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence being summoning </v>

1654
01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:03.450
<v Speaker 1>the demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how he described it.</v>

1655
01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:07.890
<v Speaker 1>We can be summoning the demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think that might be what we do.</v>

1656
01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:08.873
<v Speaker 1>I think we're getting caught up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kardashians and we're looking at it </v>

1657
01:12:11.111 --> 01:12:14.400
<v Speaker 1>who's got a fake but and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are those chem trails in the sky?</v>

1658
01:12:14.401 --> 01:12:17.050
<v Speaker 1>And I'm in a 12 step program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking crossfit.</v>

1659
01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.173
<v Speaker 1>And meanwhile what we're doing is we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>given birth to some new form of </v>

1660
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:28.410
<v Speaker 1>transcendent technology that literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewires reality itself.</v>

1661
01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.700
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that is an actual theory.</v>

1662
01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:31.391
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1663
01:12:31.391 --> 01:12:32.224
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're living in the matrix that </v>

1664
01:12:33.011 --> 01:12:37.060
<v Speaker 3>it's all a computer simulation and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>equivalent of a holodeck somewhere.</v>

1665
01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:39.970
<v Speaker 3>But I don't even know if we was so real </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1666
01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:43.810
<v Speaker 3>If it was so really you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinguish between the holiday of world</v>

1667
01:12:43.811 --> 01:12:46.450
<v Speaker 3>you're in and this world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then how would you know?</v>

1668
01:12:47.170 --> 01:12:48.003
<v Speaker 3>So it really becomes one of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought experiments that's fine to </v>

1669
01:12:50.711 --> 01:12:51.544
<v Speaker 3>contemplate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how would you test it to see if it </v>

1670
01:12:53.801 --> 01:12:55.600
<v Speaker 3>was true or not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>

1671
01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:58.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you pulling up there?</v>

1672
01:12:58.421 --> 01:13:01.310
<v Speaker 3>Just googled his name and ai.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this came up from yesterday.</v>

1673
01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.500
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about neural lace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1674
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:04.920
<v Speaker 3>well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1675
01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:06.730
<v Speaker 3>Kurzweil has been talking about this for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a long time.</v>

1676
01:13:06.731 --> 01:13:07.564
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the singularity really will come about </v>

1677
01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:10.483
<v Speaker 3>with a fusion between human intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 3>and artificial intelligence for people </v>

1678
01:13:13.661 --> 01:13:15.310
<v Speaker 3>who listen and read the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1679
01:13:15.311 --> 01:13:15.940
<v Speaker 3>the title there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>what does it say in there?</v>

1681
01:13:17.170 --> 01:13:20.650
<v Speaker 3>Scroll up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elon musk hints that neural lace project</v>

1682
01:13:20.651 --> 01:13:24.220
<v Speaker 3>to fuse ai with the human brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1683
01:13:24.221 --> 01:13:27.250
<v Speaker 3>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cochlear implant.</v>

1684
01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.160
<v Speaker 3>We just said Cook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what that means?</v>

1685
01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:36.450
<v Speaker 3>Cochlear cut means now we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll go over that another time.</v>

1686
01:13:36.730 --> 01:13:38.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a new insults on the Internet.</v>

1687
01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:39.830
<v Speaker 3>A cook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's cut and fuck.</v>

1691
01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:45.160
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1692

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1693
01:13:45.581 --> 01:13:46.361
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1694
01:13:46.361 --> 01:13:47.340
<v Speaker 3>in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1695
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:49.610
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it started off with cuckold.</v>

1696
01:13:49.670 --> 01:13:50.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1697
01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.153

<v Speaker 3>steal their women and have sex with </v>

1698
01:13:54.281 --> 01:13:55.870
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then somehow or another,</v>

1699
01:13:55.871 --> 01:13:56.704
<v Speaker 3>it became an insult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A that it seems to have a bunch of </v>

1700
01:13:59.621 --> 01:14:02.530
<v Speaker 3>different meanings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's fun to use because it's new.</v>

1701
01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:03.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

1704
01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:06.873
<v Speaker 3>one of our sites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conservative insult of the mountain </v>

1705
01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:12.400
<v Speaker 3>explained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a cook serve explicit.</v>

1706
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.410
<v Speaker 2>Let's pull that down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to know what the explanation is.</v>

1707
01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.600
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>redstate.com</v>

<v Speaker 2>four letter words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>curse words,</v>

1718
01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:37.713
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have certain characteristics </v>

1719
01:14:39.401 --> 01:14:43.300
<v Speaker 2>of the words themselves that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to be short and kind of guttural,</v>

1720
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:44.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>abrupt.</v>

1721
01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck cut shit.</v>

1722
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:47.190
<v Speaker 2>It's on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1723
01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:48.970
<v Speaker 2>and there's a book coming out called </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1724
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.863
<v Speaker 2>what the F uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin Bergen is a linguist at uc San </v>

1725
01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Diego and he's coming up to do our </v>
<v Speaker 2>science alon in a few weeks.</v>

1726
01:14:55.901 --> 01:14:56.734
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the idea is that certain words </v>

1727
01:14:58.691 --> 01:15:03.691
<v Speaker 2>trigger more sort of deep emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of the brain and the limbic system</v>

1728
01:15:04.391 --> 01:15:04.810
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

1729
01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:08.320
<v Speaker 2>They're associated with bodily a flew </v>
<v Speaker 2>via,</v>

1730
01:15:08.490 --> 01:15:10.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feces,</v>

1731
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:12.430
<v Speaker 2>sperm and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1732
01:15:12.431 --> 01:15:17.020
<v Speaker 2>it's all this kind of crass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic cumins.</v>

1733
01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.033
<v Speaker 2>Cause the idea is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to hurt somebody with your </v>

1734
01:15:20.081 --> 01:15:23.200
<v Speaker 2>words emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by associating it with the,</v>

1735
01:15:23.201 --> 01:15:24.034
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a deep part of the brain that's </v>

1736
01:15:24.731 --> 01:15:25.564
<v Speaker 2>associated with really deep emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that that's the theory is there </v>

1737
01:15:28.481 --> 01:15:31.660
<v Speaker 2>is like a tale about why curse words are</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they are.</v>

1738
01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:33.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why certain words are just,</v>

1739
01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:35.650
<v Speaker 2>they're not insulting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just kind of funny.</v>

1740
01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Funky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1741
01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>K.</v>

1742
01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.221
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1743
01:15:39.221 --> 01:15:41.290
<v Speaker 2>So any with a knee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1744
01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:43.000
<v Speaker 2>that's just not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too sweet.</v>

1745
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.811
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1746
01:15:43.811 --> 01:15:46.120
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a nice nickname for a friend,</v>

1747
01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:49.240
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not surprised at all that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>work is what it is.</v>

1748
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes perfect sense.</v>

1749
01:15:50.801 --> 01:15:52.900
<v Speaker 2>Just based on the structure I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck or the ticket.</v>

1750
01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:54.970
<v Speaker 2>These are two of the worst things you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could say to somebody.</v>

1751
01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.820
<v Speaker 2>That's why cock is so popular because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems like,</v>

1752
01:15:57.821 --> 01:15:59.140
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we got a new one.</v>

1753
01:15:59.141 --> 01:15:59.974
<v Speaker 2>It has that sort of feel and surprise </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's conservative and cuckold </v>

1754
01:16:02.981 --> 01:16:05.710
<v Speaker 2>instead of what I thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a new one.</v>

1755
01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:08.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a new one that they're adding to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the word cock.</v>

1756
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1757
01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:10.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1758
01:16:10.541 --> 01:16:11.374
<v Speaker 2>to make the Oxford English dictionary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be used like a certain number </v>

1759
01:16:13.601 --> 01:16:17.320
<v Speaker 2>of times and in secondary and tertiary </v>
<v Speaker 2>sources in a year.</v>

1760
01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh well it's done then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in for sure 100% yeah.</v>

1761
01:16:21.821 --> 01:16:25.480
<v Speaker 2>The Internet is just the amount of data </v>
<v Speaker 2>that gets,</v>

1762
01:16:25.690 --> 01:16:26.523
<v Speaker 2>what's the figure about how much data </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets pushed on the Internet in a day </v>

1763
01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:33.160
<v Speaker 2>that I think it's the short amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1764
01:16:33.161 --> 01:16:35.410
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the window is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in that time,</v>

1765
01:16:35.411 --> 01:16:37.340
<v Speaker 2>more data gets passed in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1766
01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:40.990
<v Speaker 2>in the entirety of human history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

1767
01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:43.670
<v Speaker 2>that was at the beginning of Peter </v>
<v Speaker 2>Diamandis,</v>

1768
01:16:43.671 --> 01:16:45.010
<v Speaker 2>his book on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1769
01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.340
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rapid growth of technology.</v>

1770
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:50.223
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's some insane was like every month </v>

1771
01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:53.374
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the equivalent of all everything </v>

1772
01:16:54.851 --> 01:16:56.950
<v Speaker 2>that's ever been printed in the history </v>
<v Speaker 2>of humanity.</v>

1773
01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:58.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a huge number.</v>

1774
01:16:59.050 --> 01:16:59.883
<v Speaker 2>It's just think about that and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about how many books Ron Hubbard </v>

1775
01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:04.084
<v Speaker 2>must've written this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>L Ron Hubbard wrote more books than </v>

1776
01:17:06.251 --> 01:17:07.480
<v Speaker 2>anyone who's ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1777
01:17:07.481 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 2>if you got to the scientology around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1778
01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:14.540
<v Speaker 3>they all have a room with his desk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a writing pad.</v>

1779
01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:15.493
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's literally like this Casey comes </v>

1780
01:17:17.631 --> 01:17:18.464
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom B l Ron comes stumbling through the </v>

1781
01:17:22.701 --> 01:17:23.534
<v Speaker 3>door with rotten clothes and skins </v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging off of his bones and time to </v>

1782
01:17:28.251 --> 01:17:29.084
<v Speaker 3>write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This chart shows what is done on the </v>

1783
01:17:32.031 --> 01:17:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Internet every minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1784
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's 16.</v>

1785
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:40.510
<v Speaker 3>So it's got snapchat at the top with 6 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million 94040004444.</v>

1786
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:45.343
<v Speaker 3>Google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google is the most but owned by 10 fold </v>

1787
01:17:47.961 --> 01:17:50.000
<v Speaker 3>more than snapchat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of crazy.</v>

1788
01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:51.013
<v Speaker 3>But that's just translating words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are different things that are </v>

1789
01:17:52.971 --> 01:17:54.020
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1790
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:56.690
<v Speaker 3>How many different interactions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1791
01:17:57.170 --> 01:18:00.740
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is fucking crazy.</v>

1792
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:02.780
<v Speaker 3>So I mean if he would carry out your </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>

1793
01:18:02.781 --> 01:18:04.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just only a matter of time before,</v>

1794
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:05.931
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1795
01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:08.430
<v Speaker 3>sort of that singularity is reached.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1796
01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:09.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1797
01:18:09.471 --> 01:18:10.304
<v Speaker 3>one argument for the singularity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you create the virtual reality that's </v>

1798
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.903
<v Speaker 3>indistinguishable.</v>

1799
01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:14.773
<v Speaker 3>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1800
01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:15.613
<v Speaker 3>you just need enough data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really an engineering problem and </v>

1801
01:18:18.171 --> 01:18:19.004
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the question would still be in that </v>

1802
01:18:21.021 --> 01:18:21.854
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you feel like you right now </v>

1803
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:27.550
<v Speaker 3>through the eyes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>First person experiencing why not me?</v>

1804
01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.420
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1805
01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.310
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure that it would.</v>

1806
01:18:31.311 --> 01:18:32.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure either.</v>

1807
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:33.463
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of see the cryonics argument </v>

1808
01:18:34.601 --> 01:18:37.040
<v Speaker 3>because it being chronically frozen and </v>
<v Speaker 3>waken up,</v>

1809
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:39.650
<v Speaker 3>woken up again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could make that happen,</v>

1810
01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.500
<v Speaker 3>that seems like fall asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wake up,</v>

1811
01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:45.740
<v Speaker 3>anesthesia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wake up chronically frozen,</v>

1812
01:18:45.741 --> 01:18:48.560
<v Speaker 3>wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's feels to me like it's the same mark</v>

1813
01:18:48.570 --> 01:18:49.403
<v Speaker 3>of the flora in your thinking is </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is not in your mind and </v>

1814
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:55.250
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is indicis that surrounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1815
01:18:55.251 --> 01:18:58.490
<v Speaker 3>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is transcendent.</v>

1816
01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.073
<v Speaker 3>I need to study a good depok impression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause that one that's racist as fuck </v>

1817
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:06.020
<v Speaker 3>your average Indian guy.</v>

1818
01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:11.690
<v Speaker 3>Well this is what he argues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that when you die,</v>

1819
01:19:11.691 --> 01:19:12.524
<v Speaker 3>your consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind goes to where it was before </v>

1820
01:19:14.991 --> 01:19:15.830
<v Speaker 3>you were born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1821
01:19:15.831 --> 01:19:18.020
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is you don't fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that.</v>

1822
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:19.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one and no one knows that.</v>

1823
01:19:19.881 --> 01:19:21.560
<v Speaker 3>So you can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it does.</v>

1824
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:23.930
<v Speaker 3>My argument is what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where were you before you were born?</v>

1825
01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:25.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people go,</v>

1826
01:19:25.581 --> 01:19:26.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>

1827
01:19:26.661 --> 01:19:29.060
<v Speaker 3>That's a non question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't anywhere before I was born.</v>

1828
01:19:29.061 --> 01:19:29.894
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you die that you won't be </v>

1829
01:19:31.041 --> 01:19:32.060
<v Speaker 3>anywhere now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1830
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:34.460
<v Speaker 3>but maybe by Buddhists think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1831
01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:35.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you just returned to the </v>

1832
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:38.920
<v Speaker 3>consciousness in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the forest,</v>

1833
01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:40.370
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever it is.</v>

1834
01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:45.020
<v Speaker 3>I think our number one problem is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we try to have a place where you go,</v>

1835
01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.820
<v Speaker 3>we try to have an explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1836
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:47.663
<v Speaker 3>We feel like it's a place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but depok tells me this is completely </v>

1837
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:52.260
<v Speaker 3>wrong way to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1838
01:19:52.290 --> 01:19:54.560
<v Speaker 3>you're not going any place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no place.</v>

1839
01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:56.960
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1840
01:19:56.961 --> 01:19:58.760
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even with that,</v>

1841
01:19:58.970 --> 01:19:59.803
<v Speaker 3>I think there's an issue with saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know anything about what </v>

1842
01:20:03.741 --> 01:20:05.330
<v Speaker 3>happens after death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1843
01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 3>You could have a ton of theories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have</v>

1844
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.030
<v Speaker 1>like possibilities that you ponder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could sit down and be as creative as</v>

1845
01:20:12.031 --> 01:20:15.460
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could start and think about the,</v>

1846
01:20:15.461 --> 01:20:16.294
<v Speaker 1>the number of known stars in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe and then start to perceive how </v>

1847
01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:21.443
<v Speaker 1>immense the universe is and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is going on in consciousness </v>

1848
01:20:24.481 --> 01:20:25.400
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it,</v>

1849
01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:28.530
<v Speaker 1>when it ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that energy go somewhere and become</v>

1850
01:20:28.531 --> 01:20:31.320
<v Speaker 1>some thing that we haven't considered?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do that all day long.</v>

1851
01:20:31.321 --> 01:20:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's fun.</v>

1852
01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:33.593
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is when anyone says they</v>
<v Speaker 1>know when you go back to become a baby </v>

1853
01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:42.030
<v Speaker 1>again and your start the world from how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck do you know you don't?</v>

1854
01:20:42.090 --> 01:20:45.180
<v Speaker 1>The answer is don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to think that you might</v>

1855
01:20:45.181 --> 01:20:47.730
<v Speaker 1>be a baby again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to think that you might</v>

1856
01:20:47.731 --> 01:20:48.564
<v Speaker 1>live you like I've heard the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what religion promotes this </v>

1857
01:20:51.421 --> 01:20:52.254
<v Speaker 1>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you live your entire life over </v>

1858
01:20:54.751 --> 01:20:57.150
<v Speaker 1>and over and over again until you get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1859
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:59.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the term old soul comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

1860
01:21:00.370 --> 01:21:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Like you're running like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously a very wise man,</v>

1861
01:21:03.901 --> 01:21:04.734
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you probably were an idiot a few </v>

1862
01:21:06.451 --> 01:21:07.284
<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand generations ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've gotten to this point where </v>

1863
01:21:10.141 --> 01:21:12.160
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've figured out how to live your life</v>

1864
01:21:12.161 --> 01:21:12.994
<v Speaker 1>very harmoniously and in doing that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you exhibit all the traits of an old </v>

1865
01:21:17.131 --> 01:21:18.810
<v Speaker 1>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is instead of,</v>

1866
01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:20.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain people up there,</v>

1867
01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all have seen them on the Internet </v>

1868
01:21:22.831 --> 01:21:24.750
<v Speaker 1>that do ridiculous things and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1869
01:21:24.751 --> 01:21:26.340
<v Speaker 1>why are they so stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they doing?</v>

1870
01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe they've only is their third </v>
<v Speaker 1>or fourth go around.</v>

1871
01:21:30.150 --> 01:21:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the,</v>

1872
01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:34.050
<v Speaker 1>that is entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

1873
01:21:34.051 --> 01:21:34.884
<v Speaker 1>You don't know why you were born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what happens when you </v>

1874
01:21:36.721 --> 01:21:37.554
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is in saying that you have </v>

1875
01:21:40.081 --> 01:21:41.340
<v Speaker 1>an explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1876
01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a materialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very cold,</v>

1877
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:46.583
<v Speaker 1>scientific analysis of the possibilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like what we know today and </v>

1878
01:21:50.401 --> 01:21:51.234
<v Speaker 1>deny any possibilities of anything being</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything other than death being the end </v>

1879
01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:56.480
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know that either.</v>

1880
01:21:57.090 --> 01:21:57.811
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1881
01:21:57.811 --> 01:21:58.644
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>

1882
01:21:58.650 --> 01:22:03.330
<v Speaker 2>But so from the scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no hypothesis that is your theory is not</v>

1883
01:22:03.331 --> 01:22:08.331
<v Speaker 2>true until proven otherwise we would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing happens when you're dead,</v>

1884
01:22:08.671 --> 01:22:09.870
<v Speaker 2>you're just gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be,</v>

1885
01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:13.140
<v Speaker 2>and t unless there's some other </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative we can test.</v>

1886
01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:14.003
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>

1887
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:16.390
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite thought experiments </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from Carl Sagan,</v>

1888
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:18.810
<v Speaker 2>demon haunted world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome book,</v>

1889
01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Awesome Book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The chapter is called,</v>

1890
01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:22.170
<v Speaker 2>there's a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my garage.</v>

1891
01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:24.090
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1892
01:22:24.091 --> 01:22:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1893
01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:26.820
<v Speaker 2>I have a dragon in my garage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do?</v>

1894
01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:28.200
<v Speaker 2>So cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I see it?</v>

1895
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1896
01:22:28.771 --> 01:22:29.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here.</v>

1897
01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.480
<v Speaker 2>Curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I opened the garage door.</v>

1898
01:22:30.481 --> 01:22:32.760
<v Speaker 2>You look in and there's some paint cans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A ladder.</v>

1899
01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:34.650
<v Speaker 2>A bike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no dragon.</v>

1900
01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's an invisible dragon.</v>

1901
01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:39.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you say a,</v>

1902
01:22:39.931 --> 01:22:40.764
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put some powder down on the </v>

1903
01:22:41.341 --> 01:22:42.560
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he walks around,</v>

1904
01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:44.300
<v Speaker 2>we'll see his footprints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1905
01:22:44.301 --> 01:22:47.790
<v Speaker 2>you see this dragon hovers about three </v>
<v Speaker 2>feet above the ground at all times.</v>

1906
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:49.230
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1907
01:22:49.231 --> 01:22:52.050
<v Speaker 2>I got some infrared cameras here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could detect the heat.</v>

1908
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Now this is a cold blooded drag and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives us no temperature at all.</v>

1909
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:57.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1910
01:22:57.391 --> 01:23:00.360
<v Speaker 2>I have this heat detector and when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>spits out the fire,</v>

1911
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:02.040
<v Speaker 2>then we'll see that the fire comes out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

1912
01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:03.510
<v Speaker 2>And that'll prove that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1913
01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:04.410
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's coal fire.</v>

1914
01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Now this is not heat generating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five is a very special kind of fire.</v>

1915
01:23:07.930 --> 01:23:08.763
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so seconds point is what's the </v>

1916
01:23:09.491 --> 01:23:10.840
<v Speaker 2>difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1917
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:11.703
<v Speaker 2>invisible hovering cold in detectable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immeasurable dragon and no dragon at </v>

1918
01:23:16.961 --> 01:23:19.270
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if there's not,</v>

1919
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:21.460
<v Speaker 2>if there's not some way for us to get at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1920
01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:24.270
<v Speaker 2>then we can't assume it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1921
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:26.350
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I apply that to God.</v>

1922
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:27.783
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause people do all God is outside of </v>

1923
01:23:28.511 --> 01:23:29.740
<v Speaker 2>space and time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1924
01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:33.160
<v Speaker 2>How do you know if he's outside of space</v>
<v Speaker 2>and time and no way to measure it?</v>

1925
01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:34.563
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he reaches into the art world to stir </v>

1926
01:23:36.101 --> 01:23:37.600
<v Speaker 2>the particles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cure the cancer,</v>

1927
01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.220
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1928
01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:40.083
<v Speaker 2>Can we measure that and does it look </v>
<v Speaker 2>different from what happens naturally </v>

1929
01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:44.693
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's why w w why is it that would </v>

1930
01:23:45.701 --> 01:23:46.534
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God always cures is things that might </v>

1931
01:23:48.331 --> 01:23:50.230
<v Speaker 2>have gotten better anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1932
01:23:50.231 --> 01:23:53.470
<v Speaker 2>tumors do go into remission and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of them don't.</v>

1933
01:23:53.471 --> 01:23:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get cancer,</v>

1934
01:23:54.551 --> 01:23:56.560
<v Speaker 2>they die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why didn't God heal them?</v>

1935
01:23:56.561 --> 01:23:59.230
<v Speaker 2>He only seems to heal the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally go into remission.</v>

1936
01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:00.453
<v Speaker 2>How come he doesn't grow amputated limbs</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Christian soldiers coming back from </v>

1937
01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:06.250
<v Speaker 2>a rack?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come,</v>

1938
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:08.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are Christian families praying for</v>

1939
01:24:08.411 --> 01:24:10.750
<v Speaker 2>their Christian loved ones who lost a </v>
<v Speaker 2>limb.</v>

1940
01:24:11.230 --> 01:24:13.420
<v Speaker 2>You know he's busy curing cancer over </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1941
01:24:13.421 --> 01:24:17.620
<v Speaker 2>but why can't he handled the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 2>never ever naturally grow back?</v>

1942
01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:20.880
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between a </v>
<v Speaker 2>invisible dragon?</v>

1943
01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:21.470
<v Speaker 2>No Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1944
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:22.303
<v Speaker 2>that's so always you know when yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is my theory of the afterlife </v>

1945
01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:26.080
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nice.</v>

1946
01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:27.513
<v Speaker 2>How do you know</v>

1947
01:24:27.670 --> 01:24:29.500
<v Speaker 1>you do not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do not know.</v>

1948
01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:30.393
<v Speaker 1>And when it comes to religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of some sort of a powerful </v>

1949
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:39.850
<v Speaker 1>being that's in charge of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture and it's got a grand plan for it</v>

1950
01:24:39.851 --> 01:24:40.684
<v Speaker 1>all is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of comforting to some people </v>

1951
01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.280
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's an interesting possibility.</v>

1952
01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:47.770
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something to consider.</v>

1953
01:24:47.771 --> 01:24:48.604
<v Speaker 1>It's something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an idea that's been around for a </v>

1954
01:24:50.441 --> 01:24:52.660
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why has it been around for so long?</v>

1955
01:24:52.661 --> 01:24:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1956
01:24:53.861 --> 01:24:57.130
<v Speaker 1>let's go over some of the other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had been around for a long time.</v>

1957
01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.013
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at what else is in that book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any other shit in that book </v>

1958
01:25:01.541 --> 01:25:03.010
<v Speaker 1>that you might think is ridiculous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1959
01:25:03.011 --> 01:25:03.844
<v Speaker 1>isn't there a story in that book about </v>
<v Speaker 1>two children that taught demand because </v>

1960
01:25:06.971 --> 01:25:10.090
<v Speaker 1>he's bald.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they sick bears on the kids.</v>

1961
01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that story in the Bible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it with his name?</v>

1962
01:25:13.011 --> 01:25:13.844
<v Speaker 1>But Lisa has what it was is the guy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>name who is taunted by these children </v>

1963
01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:22.330
<v Speaker 1>because of his baldness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So God's summons to bears to come out of</v>

1964
01:25:22.331 --> 01:25:23.164
<v Speaker 1>the woods and mall these children and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill them because they taunted his be </v>

1965
01:25:27.341 --> 01:25:29.560
<v Speaker 1>fade with the Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1966
01:25:29.890 --> 01:25:30.723
<v Speaker 1>but if you're talking to someone who's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious person who believes in the </v>

1967
01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Bible and you throw that around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things that goes well,</v>

1968
01:25:37.181 --> 01:25:38.620
<v Speaker 1>that's the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1969
01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1970
01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:41.540
<v Speaker 1>so the Old Testament is not valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1971
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:42.423
<v Speaker 1>The New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that was written by constant </v>

1972
01:25:44.041 --> 01:25:47.350
<v Speaker 1>teen and a group of bishops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they got down,</v>

1973
01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:51.100
<v Speaker 1>they thought they wrote it out for what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 years after Jesus died.</v>

1974
01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:53.850
<v Speaker 1>That one's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that.</v>

1975
01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:55.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got some more ridiculous when </v>

1976
01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:58.270
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause constantine wasn't even,</v>

1977
01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.730
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't even Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1978
01:25:59.731 --> 01:26:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

1979
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:01.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1980
01:26:01.321 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 2>Tom in the gospels appear to be 30</v>

1981
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:05.110
<v Speaker 3>to 60,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first one,</v>

1982
01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.790
<v Speaker 3>30 to 60 years after Jesus died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>book of Mark,</v>

1983
01:26:07.850 --> 01:26:12.180
<v Speaker 3>the others were copied from mark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously John is really weird and uh,</v>

1984
01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:13.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one knew him.</v>

1985
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:14.061
<v Speaker 3>These weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1986
01:26:14.061 --> 01:26:16.850
<v Speaker 3>the Gospel authors didn't know they </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't his disciples,</v>

1987
01:26:16.851 --> 01:26:19.010
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is second hand,</v>

1988
01:26:19.011 --> 01:26:20.120
<v Speaker 3>third hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1989
01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:22.600
<v Speaker 3>And there was a committee that decided </v>
<v Speaker 3>what that's right.</v>

1990
01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:26.270
<v Speaker 3>Scott Bass for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was voted out.</v>

1991
01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:27.163
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1992
01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:28.083
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>

1993
01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.770
<v Speaker 3>It's a twitter poll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a twitter poll.</v>

1994
01:26:30.771 --> 01:26:34.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The got all together evil twitter poll.</v>

1995
01:26:34.281 --> 01:26:36.950
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And any case,</v>

1996
01:26:36.951 --> 01:26:38.780
<v Speaker 3>where did Jesus become a conservative?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1997
01:26:38.781 --> 01:26:41.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the gospels he talks about,</v>

1998
01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:41.841
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1999
01:26:41.841 --> 01:26:44.300
<v Speaker 3>giving up your belongings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taken care of the poor,</v>

2000
01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.553
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2001
01:26:45.630 --> 01:26:46.463
<v Speaker 3>the chances of a rich man going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>heaven or it's like going through the </v>

2002
01:26:49.431 --> 01:26:50.150
<v Speaker 3>eye of a needle.</v>

2003
01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:54.080
<v Speaker 3>You can't do it made wine for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>carpenter.</v>

2004
01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:54.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2005
01:26:54.951 --> 01:26:56.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2006
01:26:56.121 --> 01:26:57.260
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2007
01:26:58.070 --> 01:27:01.880
<v Speaker 3>his conservative values would be suspect</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you actually read what he said.</v>

2008
01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:03.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean all the depictions of them,</v>

2009
01:27:03.831 --> 01:27:04.664
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a fucking hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a dirty white hippie </v>

2010
01:27:07.610 --> 01:27:08.830
<v Speaker 3>somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another white guy,</v>

2011
01:27:08.831 --> 01:27:13.831
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in the Middle East and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know the year zero I have a feeling they</v>

2012
01:27:15.051 --> 01:27:17.480
<v Speaker 3>probably looked like they look now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you think?</v>

2013
01:27:17.481 --> 01:27:18.314
<v Speaker 3>I mean why is that guy looks so like he </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like a lost kid who lives in </v>

2014
01:27:22.341 --> 01:27:25.590
<v Speaker 3>Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's rebelling from his parents and well</v>

2015
01:27:25.610 --> 01:27:29.690
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what made the life of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian such a great film money pipeline.</v>

2016
01:27:29.691 --> 01:27:33.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like they really nailed it and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>nailed it a long time ago.</v>

2017
01:27:33.261 --> 01:27:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Right back when you really couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this before blazing saddles.</v>

2018
01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:42.660
<v Speaker 3>It was super controversial movie at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and groundbreaking in terms of like</v>

2019
01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:45.463
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we look at comedy from like the 60s or </v>

2020
01:27:48.171 --> 01:27:49.004
<v Speaker 3>the 70s and we look at it in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we know to be shocking and crazy </v>

2021
01:27:54.231 --> 01:27:57.050
<v Speaker 3>today and it's our bar's so different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2022
01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:57.933
<v Speaker 3>It's hard when you go back and watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things to really take in the </v>

2023
01:28:00.921 --> 01:28:01.754
<v Speaker 3>context of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to Guy Tory about this </v>

2024
01:28:04.570 --> 01:28:07.370
<v Speaker 3>funny comedian friend of mine about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>last night.</v>

2025
01:28:07.371 --> 01:28:08.204
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how good lenny bruce was and how we </v>

2026
01:28:12.351 --> 01:28:15.530
<v Speaker 3>really can understand it because comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>is sort of,</v>

2027
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.423
<v Speaker 3>it continues to progress and it sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reflects the attitudes of the times and </v>

2028
01:28:20.391 --> 01:28:21.224
<v Speaker 3>we're so much more open minded and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much further down the line than we were </v>

2029
01:28:25.251 --> 01:28:29.970
<v Speaker 3>in 1960 whatever when lenny was getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrested for using bad words.</v>

2030
01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:30.804
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's hard for us to preciate it's </v>

2031
01:28:32.871 --> 01:28:33.704
<v Speaker 3>hard for us to really understand like if</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were kids back then and we went to </v>

2032
01:28:35.901 --> 01:28:36.734
<v Speaker 3>see Lenny Bruce and we were living in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this like really restrictive </v>

2033
01:28:39.261 --> 01:28:43.040
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the 1950s in 1960s then we'd be</v>

2034
01:28:43.041 --> 01:28:45.350
<v Speaker 3>blown away by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is he saying?</v>

2035
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:46.183
<v Speaker 3>This is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But today you listen to it and it's </v>

2036
01:28:48.831 --> 01:28:49.664
<v Speaker 3>almost pedestrian or have some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that he has to say because it's </v>

2037
01:28:52.191 --> 01:28:54.740
<v Speaker 3>already been said because he broke down </v>
<v Speaker 3>the door.</v>

2038
01:28:54.741 --> 01:28:55.521
<v Speaker 3>Then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2039
01:28:55.521 --> 01:28:58.730
<v Speaker 3>that holds been there forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they could even make blazing saddles</v>

2040
01:28:58.731 --> 01:28:59.600
<v Speaker 3>today because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2041
01:28:59.610 --> 01:29:01.920
<v Speaker 3>they use the n word constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're out there.</v>

2042
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:03.920
<v Speaker 3>It's good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you make that movie,</v>

2043
01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:04.913
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the characters has that line </v>

2044
01:29:05.971 --> 01:29:06.840
<v Speaker 3>about a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2045
01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:09.420
<v Speaker 3>well let him the niggers in the big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not the Irish.</v>

2046
01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:11.370
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2047
01:29:11.371 --> 01:29:14.130
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't say that today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even in us had tire.</v>

2048
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:17.130
<v Speaker 3>We'll think about a character like </v>
<v Speaker 3>archie bunker.</v>

2049
01:29:17.610 --> 01:29:18.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it is you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they blago sphere would erupt the </v>

2053
01:29:27.691 --> 01:29:28.524
<v Speaker 3>honeymooners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jackie gleason used to threaten to beat </v>

<v Speaker 3>his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the to the moon.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's going to put her on the moon.</v>

2056
01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:39.540
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>

2057
01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People used to smack people all the time</v>

2058
01:29:43.081 --> 01:29:44.070
<v Speaker 3>in movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back then,</v>

2059
01:29:44.370 --> 01:29:46.380
<v Speaker 3>men were always beating women up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2060
01:29:46.410 --> 01:29:47.243
<v Speaker 3>It was like a natural part of behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the point where we didn't even mind </v>

2061
01:29:51.151 --> 01:29:51.984
<v Speaker 3>it from heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heroes with smack a woman in the mouth </v>

2062
01:29:54.661 --> 01:29:55.470
<v Speaker 3>and she'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>

2063
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:57.720
<v Speaker 3>And then they would invariably wind up </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking them.</v>

2064
01:29:58.310 --> 01:30:01.320
<v Speaker 3>Like right afterwards they'd smack them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they start making out.</v>

2065
01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:04.200
<v Speaker 3>Seinfeld is a little riff on Paul </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mccartney's.</v>

2066
01:30:04.290 --> 01:30:06.780
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to run for your life.</v>

2067
01:30:06.781 --> 01:30:09.550
<v Speaker 3>You better run for your life if you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>a little girl,</v>

2068
01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:12.240
<v Speaker 3>cause I'll get you in the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the other one was,</v>

2069
01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:14.850
<v Speaker 3>she was just 17,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know what I mean.</v>

2070
01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:16.440
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no Paul,</v>

2071
01:30:16.441 --> 01:30:19.710
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we talking about here?</v>

2072
01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.740
<v Speaker 3>But that's early sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was normal.</v>

2073
01:30:22.741 --> 01:30:24.420
<v Speaker 3>Like how about kiss?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had that song,</v>

2074
01:30:24.421 --> 01:30:27.690
<v Speaker 3>Christine 16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gene Simmons a sang that song.</v>

2075
01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:29.730
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a big hit.</v>

2076
01:30:29.731 --> 01:30:32.370
<v Speaker 3>Christine's 16.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to hover.</v>

2077
01:30:32.570 --> 01:30:34.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2078
01:30:34.771 --> 01:30:36.720
<v Speaker 3>Well or you got to have you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2079
01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:37.613
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a good song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's fucked up when you go back and </v>

2080
01:30:42.841 --> 01:30:44.100
<v Speaker 3>listen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2081
01:30:44.110 --> 01:30:45.270
<v Speaker 3>you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2082
01:30:45.271 --> 01:30:47.990
<v Speaker 3>like you're singing about a little baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2083
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:48.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2084
01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:50.440
<v Speaker 3>and you realize when you become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2085
01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:54.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm 49 now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at like a 16 year old,</v>

2086
01:30:54.301 --> 01:30:57.080
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ like kid.</v>

2087
01:30:57.140 --> 01:31:00.600
<v Speaker 3>We'll give her a couple of years even </v>
<v Speaker 3>eighteens ridiculous.</v>

2088
01:31:00.601 --> 01:31:01.434
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2089
01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:04.800
<v Speaker 3>So what is legal and what is not legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>is very strange,</v>

2090
01:31:04.801 --> 01:31:06.030
<v Speaker 3>but those songs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2091
01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:07.883
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of moral progress that that </v>

2092
01:31:09.271 --> 01:31:12.060
<v Speaker 3>kind of change happens to slow enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't really notice it,</v>

2093
01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.820
<v Speaker 3>but looking back a few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2094
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:15.833
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2104
01:31:36.391 --> 01:31:37.224
<v Speaker 3>Like backhand in Sean Connery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marilyn Sean connery was interviewed by </v>

2105
01:31:40.981 --> 01:31:43.950
<v Speaker 3>Barbara Walters and he was advocating </v>
<v Speaker 3>smacking women.</v>

2106
01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:45.330
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From charms.</v>

2107
01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.633
<v Speaker 3>Just keep pushing it and they won't let </v>
<v Speaker 3>it go and you have to give them a smart </v>

2108
01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:52.313
<v Speaker 3>and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you saying that you stretched your </v>

2109
01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:57.000
<v Speaker 3>truck trucker where I'm trying like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bogart line.</v>

2110
01:31:57.001 --> 01:31:57.834
<v Speaker 3>I never met a team that didn't was it </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't like a smack in the mouth or a </v>

2111
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.290
<v Speaker 3>Clo Colt 45 or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a slug from a goal 40</v>

2112
01:32:06.170 --> 01:32:07.003
<v Speaker 4>a woman now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then as I remember you said you </v>

2113
01:32:08.001 --> 01:32:10.880
<v Speaker 4>don't do it with a clenched fist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's better to do it with an open hand.</v>

2114
01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:12.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>

2115
01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to love that.</v>

2116
01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.940
<v Speaker 4>I haven't changed my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2117
01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:20.690
<v Speaker 4>You think it's good to slap a woman?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2118
01:32:20.691 --> 01:32:21.524
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think it's bad that I don't </v>

2119
01:32:23.541 --> 01:32:24.374
<v Speaker 4>think it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that it depends entirely on the </v>

2120
01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:29.700
<v Speaker 4>circumstances and if it marriage it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what would narrate it.</v>

2121
01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:31.213
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have tried everything else and </v>

2122
01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:40.850
<v Speaker 4>they kind of put it alone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to have the last word,</v>

2123
01:32:40.851 --> 01:32:42.710
<v Speaker 4>then you give them the laughing last </v>
<v Speaker 4>word,</v>

2124
01:32:42.711 --> 01:32:43.544
<v Speaker 4>but they're not happy with the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to share it again and and get </v>

2125
01:32:48.381 --> 01:32:53.381
<v Speaker 4>into a really provocative situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then one and a half million.</v>

2126
01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:56.683
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>when she hits him with a question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's a gotcha moment.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2150
01:34:00.171 --> 01:34:01.004
<v Speaker 3>it sent him on a spiraling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they stayed married for quite a </v>

2151
01:34:02.581 --> 01:34:05.460
<v Speaker 3>while after the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was on the show.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's one of the most terrifying combat </v>

2155
01:34:16.411 --> 01:34:20.310
<v Speaker 3>sport athletes the world's ever known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His success is,</v>

2156
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:21.783
<v Speaker 3>it's focused entirely on him being </v>
<v Speaker 3>violent as humanly possible beyond the </v>

2157
01:34:26.671 --> 01:34:31.671
<v Speaker 3>limitations of other people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional purveyors of violence.</v>

2158
01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.410
<v Speaker 3>Like he's the best at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2159
01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:35.813
<v Speaker 3>Brand of violence is so much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>ferocious than any other fucking person </v>

2160
01:34:39.181 --> 01:34:40.014
<v Speaker 3>who's ever done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He makes all these other professional </v>

2161
01:34:41.881 --> 01:34:45.000
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight boxers look like pussies.</v>

<v Speaker 3>they practically faint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throws punches that miss and they fall </v>

2163
01:34:48.241 --> 01:34:49.170
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2164
01:34:49.410 --> 01:34:51.900
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2170
01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:03.093
<v Speaker 1>are you doing this publicly because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe this is the only way to reach </v>

2171
01:35:05.721 --> 01:35:06.620
<v Speaker 1>him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the only thing?</v>

2172
01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.710
<v Speaker 2>There was a minor controversy bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is before the Internet,</v>

2173
01:35:10.711 --> 01:35:11.730
<v Speaker 2>so it didn't go viral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2174
01:35:12.170 --> 01:35:13.003
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the La Times had a story about the rams </v>

2175
01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:19.200
<v Speaker 2>defensive line that was called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fearsome foursome in the 19,</v>

2176
01:35:19.230 --> 01:35:20.910
<v Speaker 2>late sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early seventies.</v>

2177
01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:22.141
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2178
01:35:22.141 --> 01:35:22.974
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rosie greer was one of them and he was </v>

2179
01:35:24.151 --> 01:35:25.620
<v Speaker 2>just terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

2180
01:35:25.621 --> 01:35:29.190
<v Speaker 2>And he was talking about how he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>head slap the other Lineman,</v>

2181
01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:29.641
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2182
01:35:29.641 --> 01:35:31.530
<v Speaker 2>the snap and he banned like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2183
01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Then they had an open hole there for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ears.</v>

2184
01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.553
<v Speaker 2>So the air pressure would like break the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's eardrum if he did it right and </v>

2185
01:35:37.591 --> 01:35:38.424
<v Speaker 2>this would throw him off a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he could sack the quarterback or </v>

2186
01:35:40.261 --> 01:35:41.310
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was his thing.</v>

2187
01:35:41.730 --> 01:35:43.170
<v Speaker 2>And then he mentioned like in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview,</v>

2188
01:35:43.171 --> 01:35:44.010
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2189
01:35:44.011 --> 01:35:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I had slapped my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my girlfriend or my wife or whatever.</v>

2190
01:35:46.891 --> 01:35:47.850
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2191
01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:49.260
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do this to you?</v>

2192
01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:51.030
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy moly.</v>

2193
01:35:51.031 --> 01:35:53.240
<v Speaker 2>And it didn't make a big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was there in the title.</v>

2194
01:35:53.241 --> 01:35:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I remember reading it thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Dang,</v>

2195
01:35:54.931 --> 01:35:55.890
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2196
01:35:55.891 --> 01:35:56.370
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2197
01:35:56.370 --> 01:35:59.460
<v Speaker 2>if you're six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight and your weight 300 pounds and you</v>

2198
01:35:59.461 --> 01:36:00.600
<v Speaker 2>have a helmet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing.</v>

2199
01:36:00.601 --> 01:36:02.730
<v Speaker 2>But if you know a little Bam,</v>

2200
01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:03.993
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was also probably tolerated so </v>

2201
01:36:06.161 --> 01:36:08.920
<v Speaker 1>much back then that those women didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any recourse.</v>

2202
01:36:08.921 --> 01:36:11.230
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't go to a tmz or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2203
01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:12.113
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't take video and put it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their phone and then put it on the </v>

2204
01:36:15.191 --> 01:36:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Internet and have it go viral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were scared.</v>

2205
01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:18.573
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got some six eight 400 pound </v>

2206
01:36:20.230 --> 01:36:23.740
<v Speaker 1>gigantic dude wants to hit you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he also had sex with you,</v>

2207
01:36:23.741 --> 01:36:24.790
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2208
01:36:24.791 --> 01:36:27.130
<v Speaker 1>how do you get out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard enough to get out of a regular</v>

2209
01:36:27.131 --> 01:36:27.964
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2210
01:36:27.970 --> 01:36:28.803
<v Speaker 1>Like the poor lady who had to get on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage with Anthony Robbins and call her </v>

2211
01:36:30.701 --> 01:36:31.900
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2212
01:36:31.901 --> 01:36:32.734
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But imagine if her boyfriend is a </v>

2213
01:36:34.871 --> 01:36:37.240
<v Speaker 1>fucking giant football player who likes </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting her.</v>

2214
01:36:37.330 --> 01:36:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

2215
01:36:38.290 --> 01:36:39.123
<v Speaker 1>if it was in the movies like that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have sean connery talking about it </v>

2216
01:36:41.711 --> 01:36:43.570
<v Speaker 1>on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes accepted.</v>

2217
01:36:43.571 --> 01:36:44.404
<v Speaker 1>Like then we get into this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>determinism thing like is that guy </v>

2218
01:36:46.811 --> 01:36:47.644
<v Speaker 1>beating his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beating his wife because of the culture </v>

2219
01:36:49.541 --> 01:36:51.070
<v Speaker 1>that he lives in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is that,</v>

2220
01:36:51.071 --> 01:36:53.860
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean is how much is that affecting his</v>

2221
01:36:53.861 --> 01:36:58.260
<v Speaker 1>conscious decisions and does he have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>freewill to escape that influence?</v>

2222
01:36:58.890 --> 01:37:03.390
<v Speaker 2>The way that moral progress of works in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this regard over long periods of time is</v>

2223
01:37:03.391 --> 01:37:04.224
<v Speaker 2>that it just never enters your mind to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it if you never see it or hear about </v>

2224
01:37:06.721 --> 01:37:07.554
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that reduces the number of people </v>

2225
01:37:08.971 --> 01:37:09.804
<v Speaker 2>that do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know in Sean Connery's </v>

2226
01:37:11.881 --> 01:37:14.010
<v Speaker 2>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just showed all those movie clips.</v>

2227
01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:16.560
<v Speaker 2>That's probably all he saw was yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you do.</v>

2228
01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:18.013
<v Speaker 2>And it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This would never enter my mind to do </v>

2229
01:37:19.411 --> 01:37:21.130
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it doesn't even,</v>

2230
01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:23.060
<v Speaker 2>no matter how bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but temporarily I'm not going to</v>

2231
01:37:23.230 --> 01:37:25.830
<v Speaker 1>reach out and introduce you to a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>checks.</v>

2232
01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:29.800
<v Speaker 1>The ones that want the last word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2233
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:31.440
<v Speaker 1>it's called break up with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean,</v>

2234
01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:33.090
<v Speaker 1>get out of the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go drive.</v>

2235
01:37:33.091 --> 01:37:35.640
<v Speaker 1>You've got a porsche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to the hill.</v>

2236
01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go drive.</v>

2237
01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:40.140
<v Speaker 1>You can get a hotel room somewhere dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're super rich.</v>

2238
01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:42.480
<v Speaker 1>You know you have to stay with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy lady.</v>

2239
01:37:42.930 --> 01:37:43.763
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the sort of self </v>

2240
01:37:45.331 --> 01:37:48.060
<v Speaker 1>controlled techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but count to 10,</v>

2241
01:37:48.061 --> 01:37:50.370
<v Speaker 1>leave the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are in many ways,</v>

2242
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:51.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a,</v>

2243
01:37:51.781 --> 01:37:53.470
<v Speaker 1>a product of our environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2244
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 1>in the way that we imitate our </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere so</v>

2245
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:59.490
<v Speaker 3>much mean we have patterns of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of talking,</v>

2246
01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:00.503
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's expressions that are like </v>

2247
01:38:02.191 --> 01:38:07.020
<v Speaker 3>similar or familiar to certain areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have accents that distinguished that.</v>

2248
01:38:07.021 --> 01:38:10.950
<v Speaker 3>We belong in this clan of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>live in Boston for instance,</v>

2249
01:38:10.951 --> 01:38:13.290
<v Speaker 3>where I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a Boston accent,</v>

2250
01:38:13.291 --> 01:38:16.260
<v Speaker 3>it's so clear and if you talk to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that live there,</v>

2251
01:38:16.410 --> 01:38:18.180
<v Speaker 3>they're letting you know that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>local.</v>

2252
01:38:18.210 --> 01:38:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2253
01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:22.050
<v Speaker 3>they're like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everybody sort of assimilates with a</v>

2254
01:38:22.051 --> 01:38:24.200
<v Speaker 3>certain way of thinking and a way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

2255
01:38:24.230 --> 01:38:25.063
<v Speaker 3>And it's super common to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people to adopt a predetermined </v>

2256
01:38:28.921 --> 01:38:29.754
<v Speaker 3>pattern of behavior rather than having </v>
<v Speaker 3>to think things all the way through for </v>

2257
01:38:32.521 --> 01:38:33.354
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if that predetermined pattern </v>

2258
01:38:34.561 --> 01:38:36.550
<v Speaker 3>behavior means you girlfriend mouth's </v>
<v Speaker 3>off,</v>

2259
01:38:36.551 --> 01:38:40.340
<v Speaker 3>you fucking smack her in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start doing it like it's right.</v>

2260
01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:43.590
<v Speaker 3>Whereas today it's thought of as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrific thing to do.</v>

2261
01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:48.150
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a domestic violence person.</v>

2262
01:38:48.151 --> 01:38:48.721
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2263
01:38:48.721 --> 01:38:50.520
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've hit someone,</v>

2264
01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:52.800
<v Speaker 3>you've committed assault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2265
01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:53.933
<v Speaker 3>all those horrible words and thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have attached to these things </v>

2266
01:38:56.641 --> 01:38:59.650
<v Speaker 3>that were almost nonexistent back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2267
01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:02.190
<v Speaker 3>Just a hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2268
01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:03.053
<v Speaker 3>Totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this process probably started in the </v>

2269
01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:07.253
<v Speaker 3>late Middle Ages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a book called the civilizing </v>

2270
01:39:08.191 --> 01:39:09.024
<v Speaker 3>process by Norbert Elliot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say sociologists that Steve Pinker kind </v>

2271
01:39:12.121 --> 01:39:14.640
<v Speaker 3>of made prominent in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better angels of our nature.</v>

2272
01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:16.013
<v Speaker 3>Talking about how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like books of manners and table </v>

2273
01:39:18.661 --> 01:39:22.410
<v Speaker 3>manners and how you interact with other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2274
01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:24.570
<v Speaker 3>Nonviolently you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have a knife,</v>

2275
01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:26.340
<v Speaker 3>don't care your knife with you or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2276
01:39:26.341 --> 01:39:29.010
<v Speaker 3>he had a knife to somebody who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to hand it with the handle,</v>

2277
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:31.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forward and,</v>

2278
01:39:31.231 --> 01:39:33.450
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do certain things that,</v>

2279
01:39:33.451 --> 01:39:35.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't urinate in the hallways,</v>

2280
01:39:35.431 --> 01:39:36.840
<v Speaker 3>don't defecate in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2281
01:39:36.841 --> 01:39:41.841
<v Speaker 3>this just basically these people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>gross and here's how not to be gross.</v>

2282
01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:45.210
<v Speaker 3>Don't act like pig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't act like right.</v>

2283
01:39:45.630 --> 01:39:46.463
<v Speaker 3>And in a way it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's training your brain to gain self </v>

2284
01:39:48.691 --> 01:39:50.490
<v Speaker 3>control over your impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2285
01:39:50.491 --> 01:39:52.770
<v Speaker 3>I'd really just like to take a shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>right over there.</v>

2286
01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>

2287
01:39:53.730 --> 01:39:55.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't do that.</v>

2288
01:39:55.530 --> 01:39:56.363
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't.</v>

2289
01:39:56.490 --> 01:39:59.430
<v Speaker 3>And then then an even never enters your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind to do anything like that.</v>

2290
01:39:59.910 --> 01:40:04.740
<v Speaker 3>And so the argument is that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>on this 500 year long civilizing process</v>

2291
01:40:04.741 --> 01:40:08.580
<v Speaker 3>of just training people to control their</v>
<v Speaker 3>impulses.</v>

2292
01:40:08.850 --> 01:40:12.540
<v Speaker 3>Impulse control is that prefrontal </v>
<v Speaker 3>cortex keeping a break on the,</v>

2293
01:40:12.690 --> 01:40:13.523
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sort of lower impulses that bubble </v>

2294
01:40:15.241 --> 01:40:16.770
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd really like to do that,</v>

2295
01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:17.813
<v Speaker 3>not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then pretty soon you don't even </v>

2296
01:40:18.781 --> 01:40:21.930
<v Speaker 3>think about doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now obviously there's still a handful of</v>

2297
01:40:21.931 --> 01:40:23.430
<v Speaker 3>the psychopaths or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't care,</v>

2298
01:40:23.431 --> 01:40:27.420
<v Speaker 3>but fewer and fewer of us and just from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the interview,</v>

2299
01:40:27.570 --> 01:40:31.740
<v Speaker 3>so sean connery's generation versus our </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation versus our kids,</v>

2300
01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:33.151
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2301
01:40:33.151 --> 01:40:36.420
<v Speaker 3>this is just disappearing from our </v>
<v Speaker 3>vocabulary,</v>

2302
01:40:36.421 --> 01:40:41.310
<v Speaker 3>from our repertoire of behaviors that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>will employ with other people.</v>

2303
01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:43.260
<v Speaker 3>You just don't even think about doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2304
01:40:43.410 --> 01:40:44.243
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how moral progress happens from </v>

2305
01:40:45.901 --> 01:40:46.734
<v Speaker 3>the bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It completely makes sense and it </v>

2306
01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:51.750
<v Speaker 3>completely makes sense when you look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the history of humanity,</v>

2307
01:40:51.751 --> 01:40:54.280
<v Speaker 3>how much safer it is today relatively</v>

2308
01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:55.353
<v Speaker 1>than at any other time in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much violence you're going to </v>

2309
01:40:57.701 --> 01:41:00.850
<v Speaker 1>encounter and you daily life when we see</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence to incredibly shocking.</v>

2310
01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if we lived 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

2311
01:41:03.431 --> 01:41:06.640
<v Speaker 1>it'd be incredibly rare to get through </v>
<v Speaker 1>life without seeing dead buys.</v>

2312
01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:07.823
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you became much more custom to the </v>

2313
01:41:10.001 --> 01:41:10.834
<v Speaker 1>temporary nature of being and the threat</v>
<v Speaker 1>of violence being a real part of </v>

2314
01:41:13.841 --> 01:41:14.920
<v Speaker 1>everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2315
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:15.783
<v Speaker 1>Or is this not anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think one of the things that's </v>

2316
01:41:18.011 --> 01:41:18.844
<v Speaker 1>happening as we create new technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of alleviates the physical </v>

2317
01:41:24.221 --> 01:41:29.221
<v Speaker 1>stress of life or the worry of dying or </v>
<v Speaker 1>we extend life to the point and fix,</v>

2318
01:41:30.370 --> 01:41:31.203
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>illnesses to the point where life </v>

2319
01:41:32.891 --> 01:41:35.860
<v Speaker 1>becomes a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more durable,</v>

2320
01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:39.130
<v Speaker 1>a little and people will relax more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more about the fee,</v>

2321
01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:44.140
<v Speaker 1>like the physical requirements our </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies had a few thousand years ago,</v>

2322
01:41:44.141 --> 01:41:44.974
<v Speaker 1>we were hunters and gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're constantly worried about </v>

2323
01:41:46.631 --> 01:41:48.300
<v Speaker 1>predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That physical,</v>

2324
01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:49.173
<v Speaker 1>physical requirements and the dangers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you had to be able to experience </v>

2325
01:41:51.911 --> 01:41:56.470
<v Speaker 1>and mitigate and get through every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so much more,</v>

2326
01:41:56.650 --> 01:42:00.370
<v Speaker 1>so much more dangerous than what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience on a daily basis,</v>

2327
01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:02.590
<v Speaker 1>other than like car accidents and things</v>
<v Speaker 1>along those lines.</v>

2328
01:42:02.591 --> 01:42:03.424
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we still have all those fight or </v>

2329
01:42:04.961 --> 01:42:05.794
<v Speaker 1>flight responses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still have those reward systems that </v>

2330
01:42:08.081 --> 01:42:10.360
<v Speaker 1>need to be fed because we're essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the same,</v>

2331
01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:12.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give or take a few genetic mutations,</v>

2332
01:42:12.581 --> 01:42:15.130
<v Speaker 1>the same bodies that people had 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

2333
01:42:15.210 --> 01:42:15.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2334
01:42:15.710 --> 01:42:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2335
01:42:17.150 --> 01:42:19.130
<v Speaker 2>It's like that little line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The three F's,</v>

2336
01:42:19.131 --> 01:42:22.520
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flight or reproduction or threes.</v>

2337
01:42:22.730 --> 01:42:24.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the other one or phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2338
01:42:24.170 --> 01:42:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Big One is when people don't consider is</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do people,</v>

2339
01:42:27.651 --> 01:42:30.620
<v Speaker 1>why do certain people not run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fight,</v>

2340
01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:33.140
<v Speaker 1>but panic lock up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2341
01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:36.080
<v Speaker 1>What's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a real response.</v>

2342
01:42:36.081 --> 01:42:39.110
<v Speaker 1>That is super common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't get addressed in that fight</v>

2343
01:42:39.111 --> 01:42:40.050
<v Speaker 1>flight response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2344
01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:43.640
<v Speaker 1>There's also people that can work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking freeze.</v>

2345
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.920
<v Speaker 1>But all of those</v>

2346
01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.090
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2347
01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:50.110
<v Speaker 2>in a more dangerous world actually do </v>
<v Speaker 2>age you faster that some of the research</v>

2348
01:42:50.111 --> 01:42:52.690
<v Speaker 2>I was reading these books about aging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2349
01:42:52.691 --> 01:42:54.650
<v Speaker 2>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more stress you have itch it,</v>

2350
01:42:54.651 --> 01:42:55.484
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those stress hormones leads to more </v>

2351
01:42:57.221 --> 01:42:58.054
<v Speaker 2>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more and more stuff about </v>

2352
01:42:59.681 --> 01:43:02.830
<v Speaker 2>inflammation and disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation and Alzheimer's Information</v>

2353
01:43:02.831 --> 01:43:03.664
<v Speaker 2>and the telomeres shortens your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was this big study on possums </v>

2354
01:43:08.170 --> 01:43:09.003
<v Speaker 2>in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that are out in the wild </v>

2355
01:43:10.331 --> 01:43:11.164
<v Speaker 2>getting run over and attacked and preyed</v>
<v Speaker 2>upon versus ones that were put on this </v>

2356
01:43:14.111 --> 01:43:17.380
<v Speaker 2>island where there was no predators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the food that they want.</v>

2357
01:43:17.410 --> 01:43:18.243
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones,</v>

2358
01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:21.370
<v Speaker 2>the ones that lived on the island live </v>
<v Speaker 2>significantly longer but like,</v>

2359
01:43:21.371 --> 01:43:26.371
<v Speaker 2>like 50% longer and not just accounted </v>
<v Speaker 2>for by the ones that got run over.</v>

2360
01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Not that just the aging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the aging president,</v>

2361
01:43:29.230 --> 01:43:33.010
<v Speaker 2>just living in an open dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment takes its toll on your cell,</v>

2362
01:43:33.011 --> 01:43:35.350
<v Speaker 2>eular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reproduction and how long you live,</v>

2363
01:43:35.650 --> 01:43:38.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>irrespective of predation and accidents.</v>

2364
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is back to the,</v>

2365
01:43:40.091 --> 01:43:41.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation take,</v>

2366
01:43:41.321 --> 01:43:42.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it easy,</v>

2367
01:43:42.131 --> 01:43:46.360
<v Speaker 2>lower those stress hormones because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>do take a toll on your body.</v>

2368
01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unquestionably.</v>

2369
01:43:48.051 --> 01:43:50.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean it must the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2370
01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you could</v>

2371
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.820
<v Speaker 3>get through life red lining it all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and not have,</v>

2372
01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:55.793
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like people ask that don't </v>

2373
01:43:56.601 --> 01:43:58.610
<v Speaker 3>know much about football.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't they play the whole game?</v>

2374
01:43:58.611 --> 01:44:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Like the final two minutes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

2375
01:44:00.231 --> 01:44:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do it.</v>

2376
01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:02.433
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just football in and of </v>

2377
01:44:04.551 --> 01:44:07.700
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how long can you do that?</v>

2378
01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:08.893
<v Speaker 3>Like does anybody ever figured out how </v>
<v Speaker 3>many times you can get hit by a guy </v>

2379
01:44:11.001 --> 01:44:14.390
<v Speaker 3>who's 350 lbs running 30 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2380
01:44:14.391 --> 01:44:15.224
<v Speaker 3>those guys are giant and they're huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>super athletes and they collide with </v>

2381
01:44:17.481 --> 01:44:18.314
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think a person like you or me </v>

2382
01:44:20.630 --> 01:44:21.463
<v Speaker 3>could even appreciate the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>impact that's involved in a lineman who </v>

2383
01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:31.280
<v Speaker 3>was just a giant mountain of a man using</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of his might and running into you.</v>

2384
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:36.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I can understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I like watch it on TV and I see,</v>

2385
01:44:36.061 --> 01:44:36.894
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what guy's feet are up in the air and </v>

2386
01:44:38.241 --> 01:44:39.074
<v Speaker 3>they'd go slam.</v>

2387
01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:43.070
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I physically can feel it.</v>

2388
01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:45.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I get it right.</v>

2389
01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:48.080
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that story of the,</v>

2390
01:44:48.081 --> 01:44:48.561
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2391
01:44:48.561 --> 01:44:50.510
<v Speaker 3>how could the concussion story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2392
01:44:50.511 --> 01:44:51.344
<v Speaker 3>that was first broke by espn and a duck </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a frontline in a two hour </v>

2393
01:44:53.811 --> 01:44:55.490
<v Speaker 3>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2394
01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:57.800
<v Speaker 3>that guy that died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Pittsburgh steelers center,</v>

2395

<v Speaker 3>I forget his name.</v>

2397
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's a big sports fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was featured in the movie that,</v>

2398

<v Speaker 3>of his life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say from high school football,</v>

2402

<v Speaker 3>and he webster,</v>

2405
01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:20.951
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike Webster,</v>

2406
01:45:20.951 --> 01:45:21.784
<v Speaker 3>you probably got hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hit the equivalent of a minor </v>

2407
01:45:23.961 --> 01:45:24.890
<v Speaker 3>concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2408
01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:27.980
<v Speaker 3>thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe tens of thousands of times.</v>

2409
01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:28.670
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2410
01:45:28.670 --> 01:45:31.930
<v Speaker 3>that's the cumulative effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2411
01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:34.280
<v Speaker 3>are you so crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

2412
01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:37.940
<v Speaker 3>What does this change?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I felt like God,</v>

2413
01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:39.283
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in 1927 they were 190 pounds and six </v>

2414
01:45:44.001 --> 01:45:44.834
<v Speaker 3>feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a 190 pounds is six pounds less than </v>

2415
01:45:49.041 --> 01:45:50.760
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm,</v>

2416
01:45:51.110 --> 01:45:53.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a big person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm five foot eight.</v>

2417
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:56.870
<v Speaker 3>So they're a little taller at six foot </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the average lyman,</v>

2418
01:45:56.871 --> 01:46:01.871
<v Speaker 3>which is a giant person right now in </v>
<v Speaker 3>2000 and what is the last one?</v>

2419
01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:03.410
<v Speaker 3>Eight Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it say?</v>

2420
01:46:03.411 --> 01:46:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Scroll down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll share this part at the bottom,</v>

2421
01:46:05.751 --> 01:46:10.340
<v Speaker 3>which just how hard is there hit star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But 2006 you get to the average lyman is</v>

2422
01:46:10.341 --> 01:46:15.341
<v Speaker 3>six foot four 335 he's not the average.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the outlier though.</v>

2423
01:46:15.981 --> 01:46:17.150
<v Speaker 3>Cause he said hello.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He nodded.</v>

2424
01:46:17.151 --> 01:46:17.984
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

2425
01:46:18.110 --> 01:46:18.943
<v Speaker 3>he's a little bit big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still you can see are a little bit </v>

2426
01:46:20.991 --> 01:46:23.300
<v Speaker 3>smaller than him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still they're all over 300 pounds.</v>

2427
01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:24.980
<v Speaker 3>If I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I remember Alan Page,</v>

2428
01:46:24.981 --> 01:46:25.814
<v Speaker 3>he was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was massive and it just one of the </v>

2429
01:46:27.771 --> 01:46:31.040
<v Speaker 3>great and he only two 45 you probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't even make the,</v>

2430
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:32.650
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2431
01:46:32.850 --> 01:46:34.580
<v Speaker 3>the main team now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2432
01:46:34.581 --> 01:46:36.160
<v Speaker 3>And what year was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scroll down please.</v>

2433
01:46:36.530 --> 01:46:38.660
<v Speaker 3>67 so in 67.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2434
01:46:38.661 --> 01:46:40.010
<v Speaker 3>67.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy was like,</v>

2435
01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:41.053
<v Speaker 3>like if you see like how big George </v>
<v Speaker 3>Foreman was right when George Foreman </v>

2436
01:46:43.731 --> 01:46:45.830
<v Speaker 3>was the heavyweight champ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was gigantic.</v>

2437
01:46:45.831 --> 01:46:48.500
<v Speaker 3>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when he came back,</v>

2438
01:46:48.501 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 3>when he started comeback,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was well over</v>

2439
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:50.933
<v Speaker 1>300 pounds and he was really overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think he was that big when </v>

2440
01:46:53.611 --> 01:46:54.444
<v Speaker 1>he was fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was in the two twenties to </v>

2441
01:46:55.981 --> 01:46:57.870
<v Speaker 1>thirties when he was a heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

2442
01:46:57.871 --> 01:47:00.930
<v Speaker 1>I'll beat him some of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the ones on the right there,</v>

2443
01:47:00.931 --> 01:47:02.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of body fat that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2444
01:47:02.401 --> 01:47:03.620
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2445
01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:04.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's more mass like the sumo </v>

2446
01:47:06.601 --> 01:47:07.830
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want mass,</v>

2447
01:47:07.831 --> 01:47:08.830
<v Speaker 1>not just muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2448
01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:10.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also,</v>

2449
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:11.483
<v Speaker 1>those guys are just all about power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all about power and weight </v>

2450
01:47:14.821 --> 01:47:16.620
<v Speaker 1>behind power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are certain amount of time,</v>

2451
01:47:16.621 --> 01:47:20.610
<v Speaker 1>like if you have the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power but more weight behind it,</v>

2452
01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:21.533
<v Speaker 1>you can actually probably have more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an impact when you're colliding with </v>

2453
01:47:23.821 --> 01:47:24.654
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2454
01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Like if you ever tried to wrestle with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big person,</v>

2455
01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:30.180
<v Speaker 1>like even if they're not strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the amount of mass that you have to</v>

2456
01:47:30.181 --> 01:47:32.040
<v Speaker 1>move when you're wrestling around with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2457
01:47:32.041 --> 01:47:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Like right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't consider it until someone,</v>

2458
01:47:35.610 --> 01:47:38.370
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you're in a situation like I guess</v>

2459
01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:39.533
<v Speaker 1>if you had never played football before </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you ran out there and you were </v>

2460
01:47:41.761 --> 01:47:43.920
<v Speaker 1>on the front line and you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2461
01:47:43.921 --> 01:47:46.030
<v Speaker 1>what does this going to be like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2462
01:47:46.210 --> 01:47:47.400
<v Speaker 1>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

2463
01:47:47.401 --> 01:47:49.810
<v Speaker 1>that 330 pound dude feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2464
01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:54.330
<v Speaker 1>he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Full blast into you,</v>

2465
01:47:54.620 --> 01:47:56.580
<v Speaker 1>but crazy fucking sport.</v>

2466
01:47:56.660 --> 01:47:57.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm reading this book now called </v>

2467
01:47:57.951 --> 01:47:59.810
<v Speaker 2>spitting in the soup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2468
01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:00.673
<v Speaker 2>about the history of doping in sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That goes back to the late 19th century </v>

2469
01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:07.310
<v Speaker 2>and half of it is just for survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2470
01:48:07.311 --> 01:48:09.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take these drugs just to get through</v>

2471
01:48:09.321 --> 01:48:11.960
<v Speaker 2>the next week and the next game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next contest.</v>

2472
01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

2473
01:48:13.821 --> 01:48:16.900
<v Speaker 2>and how it was this guy's argument is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was pretty accepted,</v>

2474
01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:18.260
<v Speaker 2>common and known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2475
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:20.570
<v Speaker 2>the guy that won the Tour de France five</v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

2476
01:48:20.571 --> 01:48:22.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2477
01:48:22.371 --> 01:48:23.204
<v Speaker 2>used to say that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't expect us to do this on bread </v>

2478
01:48:25.241 --> 01:48:26.180
<v Speaker 2>and water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2479
01:48:26.181 --> 01:48:29.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we raised 250 times a year and you know,</v>

2480
01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:31.850
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight hours a day of killing ourselves.</v>

2481
01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Sean Cockatiel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the French great friends,</v>

2482
01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:34.773
<v Speaker 2>cyclists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this appears to be true in most </v>

2483
01:48:36.021 --> 01:48:39.230
<v Speaker 2>sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that it wasn't until the,</v>

2484
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:44.430
<v Speaker 2>that I think it was 1906 Olympics when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people started equating doping with sin.</v>

2485
01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a moral thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're getting,</v>

2486
01:48:47.961 --> 01:48:51.110
<v Speaker 2>you're cheating as opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a medical thing.</v>

2487
01:48:51.111 --> 01:48:51.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2488
01:48:51.770 --> 01:48:52.910
<v Speaker 2>I train,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lift weights,</v>

2489
01:48:52.911 --> 01:48:54.380
<v Speaker 2>I do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat this diet,</v>

2490
01:48:54.381 --> 01:48:55.214
<v Speaker 2>I take these drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all kind of part of the mix of </v>

2491
01:48:56.901 --> 01:48:59.360
<v Speaker 2>being an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was a transition.</v>

2492
01:48:59.361 --> 01:49:02.150
<v Speaker 2>He argues socially or morally or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2493
01:49:02.570 --> 01:49:04.480
<v Speaker 2>And all these things are good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>

2494
01:49:04.481 --> 01:49:06.470
<v Speaker 2>this one thing over here is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say,</v>

2495
01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:11.330
<v Speaker 2>and cycling your Hematocrit is important</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're delivering oxygen to your</v>

2496
01:49:11.331 --> 01:49:12.230
<v Speaker 2>muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2497
01:49:12.710 --> 01:49:13.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>

2498
01:49:13.821 --> 01:49:14.654
<v Speaker 2>you and I probably have 45 to 50% </v>
<v Speaker 2>hermatocrit that's the number of red </v>

2499
01:49:17.691 --> 01:49:18.524
<v Speaker 2>blood cells in your blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So half are red blood cells delivering </v>

2500
01:49:21.231 --> 01:49:22.640
<v Speaker 2>oxygen to your muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2501
01:49:23.130 --> 01:49:25.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now if you're like in the low thirties,</v>

2502
01:49:25.190 --> 01:49:27.890
<v Speaker 2>that's anemic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this drug epo,</v>

2503
01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:28.833
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>invented by Amgen was created to save </v>

2504
01:49:31.131 --> 01:49:33.410
<v Speaker 2>patients that are anemic from cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment or whatever.</v>

2505
01:49:33.410 --> 01:49:36.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a great drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so it wasn't long before the cyclist</v>

2506
01:49:36.911 --> 01:49:38.900
<v Speaker 2>got ahold of this in the late eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early nineties.</v>

2507
01:49:38.901 --> 01:49:39.231
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2508
01:49:39.231 --> 01:49:40.550
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if 45%,</v>

2509
01:49:40.551 --> 01:49:43.760
<v Speaker 2>if I'm naturally a 45% and you're at </v>
<v Speaker 2>50%,</v>

2510
01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:45.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm losing a little edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll just,</v>

2511
01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:46.873
<v Speaker 2>I'll train at high altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll sleep in the oxygen tent or I'll </v>

2512
01:49:49.241 --> 01:49:52.750
<v Speaker 2>just take the injection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so 50% is good.</v>

2513
01:49:52.751 --> 01:49:54.070
<v Speaker 2>How about 55%?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2514
01:49:54.071 --> 01:49:57.670
<v Speaker 2>that'd be even better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about 60% and the guy who won the 96</v>

2515
01:49:58.030 --> 01:49:58.863
<v Speaker 2>tour bjarney reese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was nicknamed was Mr 60% and he's </v>

2516
01:50:01.541 --> 01:50:04.570
<v Speaker 2>like mud flows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also then,</v>

2517
01:50:04.630 --> 01:50:05.950
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2518
01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:09.340
<v Speaker 2>some cyclists started dying in the early</v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties and mid nineties.</v>

2519
01:50:09.341 --> 01:50:13.930
<v Speaker 2>There was maybe a dozen or two that died</v>
<v Speaker 2>mysteriously and it was never clear what</v>

2520
01:50:13.931 --> 01:50:14.764
<v Speaker 2>the cause was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everybody said it's the epo they </v>

2521
01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:17.650
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2522
01:50:17.650 --> 01:50:18.483
<v Speaker 2>the blood is too thick there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's having strokes or heart attacks </v>

2523
01:50:20.261 --> 01:50:22.510
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even I bought this idea.</v>

2524
01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:23.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's it.</v>

2525
01:50:23.321 --> 01:50:25.760
<v Speaker 2>I wrote this article for Scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>American about doping in sports.</v>

2526
01:50:25.761 --> 01:50:28.150
<v Speaker 2>So this is why it's wrong because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are dying.</v>

2527
01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:31.990
<v Speaker 2>But this guy's argument is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it was never proven that these people</v>

2528
01:50:31.991 --> 01:50:32.890
<v Speaker 2>died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And furthermore,</v>

2529
01:50:32.891 --> 01:50:34.300
<v Speaker 2>he takes on steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2530
01:50:34.301 --> 01:50:36.700
<v Speaker 2>this is the whole thing that started </v>
<v Speaker 2>with lyall Elsedo,</v>

2531
01:50:36.701 --> 01:50:40.690
<v Speaker 2>the Oakland Raiders linebacker who said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2532
01:50:40.691 --> 01:50:43.240
<v Speaker 2>I got brain cancer is after he was done </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing,</v>

2533
01:50:43.241 --> 01:50:44.280
<v Speaker 2>but he said it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was dude,</v>

2534
01:50:44.290 --> 01:50:46.870
<v Speaker 2>all the steroids I was taking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the meme started,</v>

2535
01:50:46.871 --> 01:50:48.340
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids causes cancer,</v>

2536
01:50:48.490 --> 01:50:49.780
<v Speaker 2>steroids feeds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>

2537
01:50:49.781 --> 01:50:50.614
<v Speaker 2>causes tumors to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy is saying that's never been </v>

2538
01:50:52.901 --> 01:50:54.940
<v Speaker 2>proven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm,</v>

2539
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:57.550
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to look into this more before </v>
<v Speaker 2>and review this book.</v>

2540
01:50:57.551 --> 01:50:58.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this really true?</v>

2541
01:50:58.781 --> 01:51:01.630
<v Speaker 2>How do we know that steroids are </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous?</v>

2542
01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:03.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it the dosage?</v>

2543
01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:06.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's mckelly Ferrari said Lance's doping</v>

2544
01:51:06.341 --> 01:51:07.310
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2545
01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:07.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2546
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:08.623
<v Speaker 2>it's the orange juice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you drink too much orange juice is </v>

2547
01:51:10.361 --> 01:51:11.650
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the dose,</v>

2548
01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:13.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so some steroids,</v>

2549
01:51:13.571 --> 01:51:15.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm epo some growth hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2550
01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:18.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of this should be maintenance.</v>

2551
01:51:18.190 --> 01:51:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Like what triggered this was looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>those huge guys.</v>

2552
01:51:21.221 --> 01:51:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get pounded,</v>

2553
01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:24.760
<v Speaker 2>you got to play again next week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that?</v>

2554
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta I gotta take that,</v>

2555
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:28.660
<v Speaker 2>get the massage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the Jacuzzi,</v>

2556
01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:30.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and take some drugs.</v>

2557
01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:32.840
<v Speaker 1>That was the premise of bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

2558
01:51:32.841 --> 01:51:33.651
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2559
01:51:33.651 --> 01:51:35.240
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big thing.</v>

2560
01:51:35.241 --> 01:51:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are all the bodies?</v>

2561
01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Like where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is this,</v>

2562
01:51:38.571 --> 01:51:40.970
<v Speaker 1>this steroid epidemic that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about?</v>

2563
01:51:40.971 --> 01:51:44.270
<v Speaker 1>What you've looking at even at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in bodybuilders.</v>

2564
01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:46.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them do die from it,</v>

2565
01:51:46.730 --> 01:51:47.563
<v Speaker 1>but the sheer amount of drugs those guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>are taking to achieve those behemoth </v>

2566
01:51:53.871 --> 01:51:54.910
<v Speaker 1>sizes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2567
01:51:55.050 --> 01:51:58.850
<v Speaker 1>I give you look at some pro body have </v>
<v Speaker 1>just outlandishly huge.</v>

2568
01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:00.133
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a battle of who can take the most </v>

2569
01:52:02.331 --> 01:52:04.880
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who could power lift the most?</v>

2570
01:52:04.881 --> 01:52:07.280
<v Speaker 1>We can lift the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could train the hardest,</v>

2571
01:52:07.281 --> 01:52:12.230
<v Speaker 1>but also who can tolerate the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous levels of these drugs.</v>

2572
01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:14.570
<v Speaker 1>And so some of those guys die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2573
01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:17.210
<v Speaker 1>But well there's the dosage is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2574
01:52:17.211 --> 01:52:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Because the amount of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing them is off the charts.</v>

2575
01:52:21.050 --> 01:52:22.640
<v Speaker 1>If you think about professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>

2576
01:52:22.641 --> 01:52:23.474
<v Speaker 1>you think about all the different </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes that are doing performance </v>

2577
01:52:25.041 --> 01:52:25.874
<v Speaker 1>enhancing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they were really dying from this </v>

2578
01:52:27.381 --> 01:52:29.270
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to body should be everywhere,</v>

2579
01:52:29.271 --> 01:52:31.520
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be just dropping like flies,</v>

2580
01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

2581
01:52:31.730 --> 01:52:32.563
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're just getting smarter </v>

2582
01:52:33.231 --> 01:52:35.660
<v Speaker 2>about it and they know it's called </v>
<v Speaker 2>microdosing.</v>

2583
01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:37.880
<v Speaker 2>In cycling with the EPA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just take a little bit,</v>

2584
01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:40.430
<v Speaker 2>just give it just a little bump just for</v>
<v Speaker 2>maintenance,</v>

2585
01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:41.653
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote that story for scientific </v>

2586
01:52:42.801 --> 01:52:43.910
<v Speaker 2>American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I interview George,</v>

2587
01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:45.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2588
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Frankie Andrea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was one of lance his teammates,</v>

2589
01:52:48.250 --> 01:52:52.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 99 and 2000 seasons that he won.</v>

2590
01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:53.593
<v Speaker 2>And he took epo and he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't really want to avoid it as long </v>

2591
01:52:57.711 --> 01:52:58.544
<v Speaker 2>as he could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said he was just getting dropped </v>

2592
01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:01.693
<v Speaker 2>from the main Peloton and he couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even do his job is just the lances </v>

2593
01:53:04.881 --> 01:53:06.650
<v Speaker 2>domestique to carry his water bottles </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2594
01:53:06.651 --> 01:53:07.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2595
01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:10.130
<v Speaker 2>you're up there in the front with Lance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dropped back to the team car,</v>

2596
01:53:10.131 --> 01:53:12.650
<v Speaker 2>get some water bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you've got to ride all the way back</v>

2597
01:53:12.651 --> 01:53:13.484
<v Speaker 2>up to the front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is hard to do when these guys are </v>

2598
01:53:14.571 --> 01:53:16.650
<v Speaker 2>cruising along at 30 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2599
01:53:16.730 --> 01:53:17.563
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to be fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he said he was getting dropped just </v>

2600
01:53:19.611 --> 01:53:21.560
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

2601
01:53:21.561 --> 01:53:23.030
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even be on the team,</v>

2602
01:53:23.031 --> 01:53:25.250
<v Speaker 2>can't do my job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he took it just to,</v>

2603
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:28.430
<v Speaker 2>just to stay in the race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so I could be a bicyclist.</v>

2604
01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Just say to deliver water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2605
01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:33.260
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of them do that.</v>

2606
01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:34.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I don't want to do it,</v>

2607
01:53:34.641 --> 01:53:38.060
<v Speaker 2>but you know it got to do it cause stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy and strong and keep going.</v>

2608
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Well you'd have a unique insight into it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you did a lot of cycling.</v>

2609
01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:42.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you did it at a very high and </v>

2610
01:53:43.251 --> 01:53:47.750
<v Speaker 1>competitive level so you had an inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>view as to the requirements.</v>

2611
01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:48.613
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's one of the more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more unique sports in that the </v>

2612
01:53:51.561 --> 01:53:52.394
<v Speaker 1>requirements are so incredibly grueling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the amount of time that you're </v>

2613
01:53:55.521 --> 01:53:56.354
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you might not be working with as </v>

2614
01:53:58.281 --> 01:53:59.114
<v Speaker 1>much effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say as a sprinter whose running 100 </v>

2615
01:54:01.671 --> 01:54:02.504
<v Speaker 1>meter like a Usain bolt tight character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the amount of time involved in </v>

2616
01:54:06.621 --> 01:54:07.454
<v Speaker 1>expenditure of energy is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the more unique and weird </v>

2617
01:54:11.091 --> 01:54:13.960
<v Speaker 1>things about cycling is you're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for an hour.</v>

2618
01:54:14.810 --> 01:54:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Like what is one day in the Tour de </v>
<v Speaker 1>France?</v>

2619
01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Notice how I said France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>

2620
01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

2621
01:54:21.361 --> 01:54:22.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually four to six hours,</v>

2622
01:54:22.881 --> 01:54:27.881
<v Speaker 1>four to six hours of pumping your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

2623
01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:30.710
<v Speaker 1>it was six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2624
01:54:30.711 --> 01:54:31.544
<v Speaker 1>When you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if it's easier than running a </v>

2625
01:54:34.041 --> 01:54:34.874
<v Speaker 1>sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's easier than running up to </v>

2626
01:54:36.171 --> 01:54:39.740
<v Speaker 1>the top of a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of time you're spending doing</v>

2627
01:54:39.741 --> 01:54:40.574
<v Speaker 1>it is another consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then mentally the drag on maintain </v>

2628
01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:46.460
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>must be huge.</v>

2629
01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:47.303
<v Speaker 1>Must be crazy.</v>

2630
01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is when I interviewed Greg Lamond.</v>

2631
01:54:49.390 --> 01:54:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that his teammates came to him,</v>

2632
01:54:52.811 --> 01:54:56.140
<v Speaker 2>this was in the 91 or 92 season in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>last,</v>

2633
01:54:56.950 --> 01:54:59.590
<v Speaker 2>and when epo was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was rampid in the Peloton,</v>

2634
01:54:59.591 --> 01:55:01.630
<v Speaker 2>everyone figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg didn't want to do that,</v>

2635
01:55:01.810 --> 01:55:04.210
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his teammates are saying,</v>

2636
01:55:04.211 --> 01:55:05.080
<v Speaker 2>well we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2637
01:55:05.081 --> 01:55:08.440
<v Speaker 2>just the course of a three week tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2638
01:55:08.441 --> 01:55:11.050
<v Speaker 2>just your medica just drops just from </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatigue.</v>

2639
01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:12.213
<v Speaker 2>He said everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like they're getting an unfair </v>

2640
01:55:13.541 --> 01:55:17.080
<v Speaker 2>advantage by going above their normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just staying level.</v>

2641
01:55:17.081 --> 01:55:17.914
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the rest of us are dropping off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the last few stages you're </v>

2642
01:55:20.831 --> 01:55:21.750
<v Speaker 2>wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2643
01:55:21.751 --> 01:55:22.511
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2644
01:55:22.511 --> 01:55:25.420
<v Speaker 2>it's like we got to do this just to stay</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the rest of the field.</v>

2645
01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:28.270
<v Speaker 2>So the level playing field argument I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess,</v>

2646
01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:29.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of morals,</v>

2647
01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:30.573
<v Speaker 2>we sort of draw the line at the needle </v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's a needle involved I guess </v>

2648
01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:35.350
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a patch or a pill,</v>

2649
01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:40.300
<v Speaker 2>it feels different than training at high</v>
<v Speaker 2>altitude or sleeping in the oxygen tent.</v>

2650
01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:41.201
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2651
01:55:41.201 --> 01:55:43.710
<v Speaker 2>like the climbers to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2652
01:55:43.711 --> 01:55:46.380
<v Speaker 2>taking epl feels like it's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial.</v>

2653
01:55:47.190 --> 01:55:50.370
<v Speaker 2>This guy's argument of this book </v>
<v Speaker 2>spitting in the soup is that it's just a</v>

2654
01:55:50.371 --> 01:55:54.570
<v Speaker 2>great Asian and we've just arbitrarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>drawn the line there and uh,</v>

2655
01:55:54.630 --> 01:55:55.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's much of it in the NFL </v>

2656
01:55:57.721 --> 01:55:58.554
<v Speaker 2>has got it just be getting to the end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the season and still being able to play </v>

2657
01:56:01.861 --> 01:56:02.970
<v Speaker 2>just because it's so hard.</v>

2658
01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that argument is very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's certain supplements that</v>

2659
01:56:06.501 --> 01:56:08.730
<v Speaker 1>you can take through effective that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually do work.</v>

2660
01:56:08.731 --> 01:56:10.650
<v Speaker 1>So how do we to stay and what was your </v>
<v Speaker 1>staff that,</v>

2661
01:56:10.651 --> 01:56:12.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the baseball players,</v>

2662
01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:14.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>andrew now understand on,</v>

2663
01:56:15.170 --> 01:56:18.690
<v Speaker 1>but they will most likely it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely bullshit.</v>

2664
01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Most likely there was an excuse for them</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing actual steroids.</v>

2665
01:56:21.790 --> 01:56:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think that Mark McGuire,</v>

2666
01:56:23.611 --> 01:56:26.460
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that some forms of that stuff,</v>

2667
01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:31.650
<v Speaker 1>some forms of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they call pro hormones can actually</v>

2668
01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:32.484
<v Speaker 1>trigger positive test results in maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive like back then when they were </v>

2669
01:56:37.651 --> 01:56:38.484
<v Speaker 1>testing people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like nothing compared to what </v>

2670
01:56:39.961 --> 01:56:40.794
<v Speaker 1>they're doing now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why really interestingly two </v>

2671
01:56:42.721 --> 01:56:43.554
<v Speaker 1>Russian Olympic wrestlers have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>stripped of their gold metals because </v>

2672
01:56:47.641 --> 01:56:48.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the past,</v>

2673
01:56:48.751 --> 01:56:49.584
<v Speaker 1>I think from 2008 they didn't even get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 2012 results in because they took </v>

2674
01:56:53.701 --> 01:56:55.770
<v Speaker 1>their samples that they had back then.</v>

2675
01:56:55.770 --> 01:56:58.800
<v Speaker 1>And now with newer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sophisticated levels of testing,</v>

2676
01:56:58.801 --> 01:57:00.840
<v Speaker 1>they've been able to show that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys were doing some shit.</v>

2677
01:57:01.410 --> 01:57:02.243
<v Speaker 1>But the UFC is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interesting proving ground for it </v>

2678
01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:06.210
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2679
01:57:06.210 --> 01:57:07.043
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Novitsky who was the head of Usada </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the drug program that got Lance </v>

2680
01:57:12.330 --> 01:57:13.163
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong and a bunch of other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>Novitsky now works for the UFC and he </v>

2681
01:57:17.431 --> 01:57:18.390
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yes.</v>

2682
01:57:18.450 --> 01:57:19.283
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he has for quite a while now and he </v>

2683
01:57:20.641 --> 01:57:21.474
<v Speaker 1>has almost completely cleaned up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of people that are doing things </v>

2684
01:57:27.181 --> 01:57:29.400
<v Speaker 1>that people still get caught every now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then.</v>

2685
01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:33.810
<v Speaker 1>But the amount of people that who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>their physiques have changed where their</v>

2686
01:57:33.811 --> 01:57:34.644
<v Speaker 1>performance has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where there results inside the octagon </v>

2687
01:57:37.651 --> 01:57:40.980
<v Speaker 1>of like drastically dropped off is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty obvious.</v>

2688
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.863
<v Speaker 1>Insignificant to the point where MMA </v>
<v Speaker 1>fans and you know the pundits and </v>

2689
01:57:45.031 --> 01:57:46.650
<v Speaker 1>analysts are looking at this and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

2690
01:57:46.651 --> 01:57:48.900
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fascinating.</v>

2691
01:57:49.050 --> 01:57:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing people change.</v>

2692
01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Like there's even a term that we use an </v>
<v Speaker 1>MMA like pre Usada like we use pre Usada</v>

2693
01:57:56.221 --> 01:57:59.610
<v Speaker 1>and post Usada like they got him off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs are the fight still is good,</v>

2694
01:57:59.611 --> 01:58:00.660
<v Speaker 1>exciting to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2695
01:58:00.661 --> 01:58:02.490
<v Speaker 1>the best guys for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2696
01:58:02.491 --> 01:58:06.870
<v Speaker 1>the best guys are still the best guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's some guys that were the best</v>

2697
01:58:06.871 --> 01:58:07.704
<v Speaker 1>guys that were on legal stuff like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to have allow testosterone </v>

2698
01:58:10.741 --> 01:58:12.870
<v Speaker 1>replacement therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be legal,</v>

2699
01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:16.320
<v Speaker 1>so all you had to do was take steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to your doctor,</v>

2700
01:58:16.321 --> 01:58:18.870
<v Speaker 1>get off the steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone crashes,</v>

2701
01:58:18.871 --> 01:58:20.040
<v Speaker 1>you go to the doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey dog,</v>

2702
01:58:20.041 --> 01:58:20.370
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

2703
01:58:20.370 --> 01:58:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I think I got low test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what son?</v>

2704
01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:23.153
<v Speaker 1>You have a condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called low testosterone and they </v>

2705
01:58:25.801 --> 01:58:27.690
<v Speaker 1>would prescribe it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same way,</v>

2706
01:58:27.691 --> 01:58:30.210
<v Speaker 1>like when you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohols and being a disease,</v>

2707
01:58:30.211 --> 01:58:31.044
<v Speaker 1>they would just decided that </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone loss as a disease and this </v>

2708
01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:35.850
<v Speaker 1>man needs his medicine.</v>

2709
01:58:36.090 --> 01:58:39.780
<v Speaker 1>And so they would give these guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone in like 35 36 year old guys</v>

2710
01:58:39.781 --> 01:58:43.210
<v Speaker 1>would be just jacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jacked and fighting.</v>

2711
01:58:43.450 --> 01:58:44.283
<v Speaker 1>Not just jacked and going to the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like involved in a sport where your </v>

2712
01:58:49.150 --> 01:58:52.300
<v Speaker 1>whole purpose is to do physical harm to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your opponent,</v>

2713
01:58:52.350 --> 01:58:53.183
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this drug allows you to do are more </v>

2714
01:58:54.971 --> 01:58:57.670
<v Speaker 1>physical harm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very different than cycling.</v>

2715
01:58:57.940 --> 01:58:58.773
<v Speaker 1>Like if a guy gets really good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>cycling and he has to use drugs to get </v>

2716
01:59:01.451 --> 01:59:03.730
<v Speaker 1>really good at cycling and he's cheating</v>
<v Speaker 1>to win,</v>

2717
01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:04.773
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if he's doing these drugs and it's </v>

2718
01:59:06.551 --> 01:59:08.650
<v Speaker 1>allowing him to put other people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital,</v>

2719
01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:10.780
<v Speaker 1>things get very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2720
01:59:10.781 --> 01:59:12.340
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the moral argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2721
01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:15.010
<v Speaker 1>if you're saying that the fights are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just as fun to watch,</v>

2722
01:59:15.011 --> 01:59:15.844
<v Speaker 1>they're exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive without the drugs and fewer </v>

2723
01:59:18.281 --> 01:59:21.550
<v Speaker 1>people are harmed from taking the drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe that's a good thing.</v>

2724
01:59:21.550 --> 01:59:22.383
<v Speaker 1>That would be argument for Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The argument can even be said that the </v>

2725
01:59:25.241 --> 01:59:28.330
<v Speaker 1>fights are more exciting because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are more vulnerable.</v>

2726
01:59:28.810 --> 01:59:29.643
<v Speaker 1>They get knocked out easier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get tired easier and sometimes it </v>

2727
01:59:31.811 --> 01:59:33.490
<v Speaker 1>makes fights crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2728
01:59:33.491 --> 01:59:34.324
<v Speaker 1>let's cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys have tested positive for epo after </v>

2729
01:59:36.521 --> 01:59:37.354
<v Speaker 1>even championship level fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was this guy I'll bag routine off </v>

2730
01:59:39.911 --> 01:59:40.744
<v Speaker 1>who's a top flyweight fighter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting enough he fought a guy who </v>

2731
01:59:44.141 --> 01:59:44.974
<v Speaker 1>doesn't dope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the best pound for pound fighter </v>

2732
01:59:46.541 --> 01:59:47.374
<v Speaker 1>in the world is Guy Demetrius mighty </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouse Johnson and the mighty mouse beat </v>

2733
01:59:50.411 --> 01:59:51.244
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways he beat him is with </v>

2734
01:59:52.361 --> 01:59:53.194
<v Speaker 1>volume and pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy couldn't keep up his pace </v>

2735
01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:57.033
<v Speaker 1>because it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Efficiency of technique is also like </v>

2736
01:59:59.291 --> 02:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>really critical in mma because the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't have efficiency and puts too</v>

2737
02:00:02.891 --> 02:00:05.560
<v Speaker 1>much kinetic energy and muscle behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques,</v>

2738
02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:06.970
<v Speaker 1>they tend to fade quicker.</v>

2739
02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.330
<v Speaker 1>It can have positive results if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch someone with a shot.</v>

2740
02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:11.950
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't over the long period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2741
02:00:11.951 --> 02:00:12.784
<v Speaker 1>you're draining your gas tank to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single and a single ballot in a single </v>

2742
02:00:15.581 --> 02:00:18.610
<v Speaker 1>bound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this efficiency overcame the drugs.</v>

2743
02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:19.493
<v Speaker 1>The other guy was on like his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his physical efficiency in this </v>

2744
02:00:21.251 --> 02:00:22.084
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is starting and stopping </v>

2745
02:00:23.561 --> 02:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>the arms race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2746
02:00:24.990 --> 02:00:25.721
<v Speaker 1>Bodybuilding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arms,</v>

2747
02:00:25.721 --> 02:00:26.554
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment somebody could get away with </v>

2748
02:00:28.511 --> 02:00:29.344
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then everybody thinks that it's being </v>

2749
02:00:30.371 --> 02:00:31.420
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they have to do it.</v>

2750
02:00:31.870 --> 02:00:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Then you have this behavioral game </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory thing of the,</v>

2751
02:00:34.151 --> 02:00:37.540
<v Speaker 1>of an arms race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Novitsky his point I guess is we were</v>

2752
02:00:37.541 --> 02:00:38.374
<v Speaker 1>going to nip it in the bud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's gonna do it and we're going to </v>

2753
02:00:39.791 --> 02:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>make the consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2754
02:00:40.911 --> 02:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>super harsh suspensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the,</v>

2755
02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:43.863
<v Speaker 1>what is it like a two year suspension if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get caught and a bunch of people </v>

2756
02:00:47.201 --> 02:00:48.340
<v Speaker 1>have gotten that two years.</v>

2757
02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:49.173
<v Speaker 1>And also you have to let you saw to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are every minute of every day </v>

2758
02:00:53.530 --> 02:00:55.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going fishing,</v>

2759
02:00:55.330 --> 02:00:57.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be on Lake Mead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2760
02:00:57.131 --> 02:00:58.330
<v Speaker 1>if you want to find me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I am.</v>

2761
02:00:58.331 --> 02:01:00.280
<v Speaker 1>And then you might get a text while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on Lake Mead,</v>

2762
02:01:00.281 --> 02:01:01.114
<v Speaker 1>come to the dock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to go to the doc and there's a </v>

2763
02:01:02.291 --> 02:01:03.970
<v Speaker 1>guy standing there and he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take your blood.</v>

2764
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:04.833
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had child son and on the podcast and </v>

2765
02:01:06.191 --> 02:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about how invasive it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how crazy it is.</v>

2766
02:01:08.651 --> 02:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>They just show up wherever you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was doing,</v>

2767
02:01:11.021 --> 02:01:13.030
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were doing it in like a closet with</v>

2768
02:01:13.031 --> 02:01:14.290
<v Speaker 1>like a mop and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2769
02:01:14.291 --> 02:01:15.124
<v Speaker 1>this is not a sanitary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you taking my blood in this weird </v>

2770
02:01:17.321 --> 02:01:20.250
<v Speaker 1>environment like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of fucked up there.</v>

2771
02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:23.320
<v Speaker 1>They're just trying to catch people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2772
02:01:23.321 --> 02:01:25.900
<v Speaker 1>that'll be interesting to see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens with these leaks that are coming</v>

2773
02:01:25.901 --> 02:01:26.321
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2774
02:01:26.321 --> 02:01:31.321
<v Speaker 1>yesterday that the Russians hacked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Usada database.</v>

2775
02:01:32.850 --> 02:01:33.683
<v Speaker 1>They had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the William Sisters and the gymnast </v>

2776
02:01:37.981 --> 02:01:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Biles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simone Biles,</v>

2777
02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:40.693
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

2778
02:01:40.900 --> 02:01:42.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're threatening to release more,</v>

2779
02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:43.241
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

2780
02:01:43.241 --> 02:01:46.150
<v Speaker 3>in the coming days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were on all kinds of,</v>

2781
02:01:46.151 --> 02:01:47.480
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't say what they were on,</v>

2782
02:01:47.481 --> 02:01:50.020
<v Speaker 3>but that they had medical exemption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2783
02:01:50.021 --> 02:01:54.050
<v Speaker 3>one of them was oxycodone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the William Sisters was on,</v>

2784
02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:55.153
<v Speaker 3>she was on oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So miles is taking that I think Rydell </v>

2785
02:01:56.931 --> 02:01:57.764
<v Speaker 3>and medication for Adhd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she came out I think today and made </v>

2786
02:02:00.261 --> 02:02:02.000
<v Speaker 3>a statement about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

2787
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:03.650
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2788
02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:04.633
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a readily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't really real in a form of </v>

2789
02:02:06.630 --> 02:02:07.463
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] is in a form of like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>amphetamine or should it be to </v>

2790
02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:12.113
<v Speaker 3>stimulant?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would think that a stimulant would </v>

2791
02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:16.640
<v Speaker 3>be a performance enhancing drug?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would they let you do?</v>

2792
02:02:16.641 --> 02:02:17.840
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2793
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:18.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty impressive.</v>

2794
02:02:19.150 --> 02:02:21.020
<v Speaker 3>Launched in the air though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that split,</v>

2795
02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:22.160
<v Speaker 3>look at that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2796
02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:23.353
<v Speaker 3>What's it say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have adhd and if taking medicine for </v>

2797
02:02:25.161 --> 02:02:25.911
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since I was a kid,</v>

2798
02:02:25.911 --> 02:02:27.530
<v Speaker 3>please know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in Kink,</v>

2799
02:02:27.531 --> 02:02:28.364
<v Speaker 3>clean sport.</v>

2800
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:30.200
<v Speaker 3>I've always followed the rules and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>continue to do so.</v>

2801
02:02:30.201 --> 02:02:33.710
<v Speaker 3>As far as play fair play is critical to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sport and is very important to me.</v>

2802
02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:35.660
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2803
02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:38.300
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how does Adhd,</v>

2804
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:39.163
<v Speaker 3>how has that affected by Ritalin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is speed due to soil is Adh </v>

2805
02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:42.933
<v Speaker 3>did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of these counterintuitive </v>

2806
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:45.103
<v Speaker 3>things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember what the chemistry of </v>

2807
02:02:46.581 --> 02:02:47.414
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the stimulant actually counters the </v>

2808
02:02:49.761 --> 02:02:52.940
<v Speaker 3>hyper activity and it slows you down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird thing.</v>

2809
02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:56.310
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember why it is hyper </v>
<v Speaker 3>activity.</v>

2810
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:57.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>controversial.</v>

2811
02:02:58.280 --> 02:02:59.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well Ange,</v>

2812
02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:00.253
<v Speaker 3>Adhd as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of those sort of loose big </v>

2813
02:03:02.721 --> 02:03:05.540
<v Speaker 3>categories that more and more people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have gotten tossed into.</v>

2814
02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:08.630
<v Speaker 3>It used to be the little boy in fourth </v>
<v Speaker 3>grade was just,</v>

2815
02:03:08.631 --> 02:03:09.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just,</v>

2816
02:03:09.250 --> 02:03:11.600
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of energy and he was always </v>
<v Speaker 3>running around.</v>

2817
02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:12.433
<v Speaker 3>Now he's got a disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got adhd while we got to medicate </v>

2818
02:03:15.171 --> 02:03:16.004
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not just let them go out and have a </v>

2819
02:03:17.241 --> 02:03:19.740
<v Speaker 3>little longer plate playtime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2820
02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:22.040
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the counter arguments to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the disease model.</v>

2821
02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:22.701
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2822
02:03:22.701 --> 02:03:24.320
<v Speaker 3>it's back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a behavior.</v>

2823
02:03:25.130 --> 02:03:26.750
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's a disease.</v>

2824
02:03:26.751 --> 02:03:28.540
<v Speaker 3>So we got to treat it with a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2825
02:03:28.541 --> 02:03:30.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have this overmedication effect.</v>

2826
02:03:31.190 --> 02:03:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Now I can't say I was a parent of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>Adhd kid.</v>

2827
02:03:34.791 --> 02:03:35.624
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be glad to have some meds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think the consensus is as far to </v>

2828
02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:42.320
<v Speaker 3>mow much medication of children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2829
02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:43.940
<v Speaker 3>who really it the be hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2830
02:03:43.941 --> 02:03:44.780
<v Speaker 3>it's a spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2831
02:03:44.781 --> 02:03:46.490
<v Speaker 3>if you're just completely out of control</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it here,</v>

2832
02:03:46.491 --> 02:03:49.760
<v Speaker 3>but most that are taking the drugs are </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably in the bell curve somewhere.</v>

2833
02:03:50.270 --> 02:03:52.880
<v Speaker 3>Not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's really important that you</v>

2834
02:03:52.881 --> 02:03:54.860
<v Speaker 3>point that out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is this great big spectrum.</v>

2835
02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:56.450
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of things we've been talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2836
02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:57.303
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people that are almost </v>

2837
02:03:58.101 --> 02:04:00.020
<v Speaker 3>unmanageable and these people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>might,</v>

2838
02:04:00.110 --> 02:04:01.970
<v Speaker 3>a kid that might just be a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>rowdy,</v>

2839
02:04:02.330 --> 02:04:03.163
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean she just jumps up and down on the </v>

2840
02:04:04.161 --> 02:04:05.660
<v Speaker 3>couch and you tell her not to and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2841
02:04:05.661 --> 02:04:07.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting this fucking kid on some </v>
<v Speaker 3>pills.</v>

2842
02:04:07.730 --> 02:04:08.970
<v Speaker 3>And in a lot of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2843
02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:11.840
<v Speaker 3>teachers want control of the classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this old,</v>

2844
02:04:11.841 --> 02:04:12.674
<v Speaker 3>it goes back to the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to put them all in rows </v>

2845
02:04:15.171 --> 02:04:19.310
<v Speaker 3>because we're training them to work in </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry or be in the military.</v>

2846
02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:22.270
<v Speaker 3>It's really all it was and that's all it</v>
<v Speaker 3>still is and we're,</v>

2847
02:04:22.271 --> 02:04:23.104
<v Speaker 3>we're stuck with the echoes of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're to the point where if you want </v>

2848
02:04:26.450 --> 02:04:31.450
<v Speaker 3>do something like there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you can do for a living that</v>

2849
02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:32.773
<v Speaker 3>don't involve the traditional model of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're trying to teach you in </v>

2850
02:04:35.901 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you think about</v>

2851
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:40.470
<v Speaker 1>those things is options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think they,</v>

2852
02:04:40.471 --> 02:04:41.304
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem preposterous and they seem </v>

2853
02:04:43.291 --> 02:04:46.410
<v Speaker 1>like a pipe dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this idea that you're going to be a</v>

2854
02:04:46.411 --> 02:04:47.850
<v Speaker 1>famous author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2855
02:04:47.851 --> 02:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>sure you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2856
02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:51.000
<v Speaker 1>they like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to be in a band.</v>

2857
02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You too.</v>

2858
02:04:52.290 --> 02:04:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations when someone's in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking band.</v>

2859
02:04:54.941 --> 02:04:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone in a band,</v>

2860
02:04:56.430 --> 02:04:58.110
<v Speaker 1>like we get all this music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2861
02:04:58.111 --> 02:04:59.510
<v Speaker 1>someone's playing this music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2862
02:04:59.670 --> 02:05:00.810
<v Speaker 1>How come I can't do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2863
02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:01.920
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2864
02:05:01.921 --> 02:05:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I have to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to get up and work.</v>

2865
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:04.583
<v Speaker 1>Like we train these people to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the path that everyone has to </v>

2866
02:05:09.301 --> 02:05:10.134
<v Speaker 1>take and the occasional person ejects </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that path and goes and makes their </v>

2867
02:05:13.381 --> 02:05:16.500
<v Speaker 1>own knives or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and start some sort of a weird business.</v>

2868
02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:20.340
<v Speaker 1>But why can't anybody who wants to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that do that?</v>

2869
02:05:20.370 --> 02:05:21.203
<v Speaker 1>Well they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is the most impressionable </v>

2870
02:05:23.371 --> 02:05:24.204
<v Speaker 1>part of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're teaching a really important </v>

2871
02:05:25.621 --> 02:05:26.454
<v Speaker 1>things like math and science and English</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grammar and we all need those </v>

2872
02:05:29.101 --> 02:05:29.934
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also teaching you patterns </v>

2873
02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:32.573
<v Speaker 1>and they're teaching you about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential for your future and this </v>

2874
02:05:35.311 --> 02:05:36.144
<v Speaker 1>potential for your future becomes like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality that you can't escape because </v>

2875
02:05:38.671 --> 02:05:41.190
<v Speaker 1>everybody else has done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your friends are all doing it.</v>

2876
02:05:41.250 --> 02:05:42.810
<v Speaker 1>What will call with college are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>applying to?</v>

2877
02:05:42.811 --> 02:05:43.644
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna major when you're </v>

2878
02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:45.420
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when are you going to take the bar?</v>

2879
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you want to be a singer?</v>

2880
02:05:49.070 --> 02:05:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Stigmatize people who don't go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>

2881
02:05:51.201 --> 02:05:52.280
<v Speaker 2>So everyone feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2882
02:05:52.281 --> 02:05:55.820
<v Speaker 2>I got to go to college and the fact is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not everyone should go to college.</v>

2883
02:05:55.940 --> 02:05:58.610
<v Speaker 2>There's really no need for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a waste of time and money.</v>

2884
02:05:58.920 --> 02:05:59.753
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to get any valuable </v>

2885
02:06:00.621 --> 02:06:03.500
<v Speaker 2>skills that they can actually use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they don't even want to be there.</v>

2886
02:06:03.501 --> 02:06:04.334
<v Speaker 2>But they feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my parents want me to go and my </v>

2887
02:06:05.751 --> 02:06:08.030
<v Speaker 2>friends are all going and society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

2888
02:06:08.031 --> 02:06:09.890
<v Speaker 2>I gotta have a decree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I got to go.</v>

2889
02:06:10.550 --> 02:06:11.383
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now he had this perforation </v>

2890
02:06:12.161 --> 02:06:14.150
<v Speaker 2>operation of colleges and universities </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2891
02:06:14.151 --> 02:06:16.310
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the skyrocketing costs and so on.</v>

2892
02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:18.380
<v Speaker 2>What was wrong with trade schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2893
02:06:18.381 --> 02:06:20.150
<v Speaker 2>now trade schools are kind of looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>down upon.</v>

2894
02:06:20.180 --> 02:06:21.410
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools.</v>

2895
02:06:21.411 --> 02:06:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Trade schools are great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2896
02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:23.873
<v Speaker 2>sort of stigmatized it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's artificially putting </v>

2897
02:06:26.691 --> 02:06:27.524
<v Speaker 2>people in places where they feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>inadequate because actually somewhere </v>

2898
02:06:30.381 --> 02:06:31.214
<v Speaker 2>else they'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd be making a lot of money at a </v>

2899
02:06:33.471 --> 02:06:36.500
<v Speaker 2>particular trade that they're really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good at and they'd be happy.</v>

2900
02:06:36.580 --> 02:06:37.413
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've altered that since the second </v>

2901
02:06:38.961 --> 02:06:39.920
<v Speaker 2>world war that's happened.</v>

2902
02:06:40.570 --> 02:06:42.720
<v Speaker 1>The structure of school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2903
02:06:42.730 --> 02:06:45.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it benefits kids and it gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>them discipline and like,</v>

2904
02:06:45.221 --> 02:06:46.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta get up at seven o'clock in the</v>

2905
02:06:46.661 --> 02:06:47.494
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to get there and you got to </v>

2906
02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:49.600
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to get your body to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2907
02:06:49.630 --> 02:06:51.410
<v Speaker 1>You got to figure out how to fire your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind up.</v>

2908
02:06:51.411 --> 02:06:52.244
<v Speaker 1>But your first class at 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM I think all that's probably good </v>

2909
02:06:54.461 --> 02:06:57.160
<v Speaker 1>because it's tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're,</v>

2910
02:06:57.161 --> 02:06:59.080
<v Speaker 1>you're overcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in,</v>

2911
02:06:59.081 --> 02:06:59.914
<v Speaker 1>in overcoming and getting through those </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests at school or getting through </v>

2912
02:07:02.081 --> 02:07:04.840
<v Speaker 1>whatever weird social stuff you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in your classroom,</v>

2913
02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:08.980
<v Speaker 1>you develop a sort of some data and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>some experience about the world.</v>

2914
02:07:09.010 --> 02:07:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something to that,</v>

2915
02:07:10.781 --> 02:07:15.700
<v Speaker 1>but I just think this model that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want people to follow,</v>

2916
02:07:15.701 --> 02:07:17.650
<v Speaker 1>when I see most people following this </v>
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>

2917
02:07:17.651 --> 02:07:18.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this,</v>

2918
02:07:18.710 --> 02:07:19.360
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2919
02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:22.090
<v Speaker 1>just because people haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>

2920
02:07:22.091 --> 02:07:22.924
<v Speaker 1>they haven't been imaginative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about what they would like to </v>

2921
02:07:24.731 --> 02:07:27.460
<v Speaker 1>do better than what they're doing now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it just this,</v>

2922
02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:32.470
<v Speaker 1>this pattern is so easy to slip into and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't even realize it until you're in</v>

2923
02:07:32.471 --> 02:07:33.670
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he can't get out of it.</v>

2924
02:07:33.671 --> 02:07:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am by,</v>

2925
02:07:35.790 --> 02:07:36.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2926
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:39.100
<v Speaker 2>by like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>udacity and the MOOC courses,</v>

2927
02:07:39.101 --> 02:07:42.280
<v Speaker 2>the teaching company courses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the audible books.</v>

2928
02:07:42.281 --> 02:07:43.114
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many ways to get a free </v>

2929
02:07:44.741 --> 02:07:45.574
<v Speaker 2>education online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of this stuff is free or super </v>

2930
02:07:47.771 --> 02:07:48.604
<v Speaker 2>cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2931
02:07:48.610 --> 02:07:50.980
<v Speaker 2>the knowledge is accessible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there for everybody.</v>

2932
02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:51.851
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2933
02:07:51.851 --> 02:07:54.970
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of the how you're going to dis</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a discipline way,</v>

2934
02:07:54.971 --> 02:07:56.920
<v Speaker 2>get the information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that,</v>

2935
02:07:56.921 --> 02:07:58.300
<v Speaker 2>that words the keyword,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2936
02:07:58.420 --> 02:07:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2937
02:07:59.390 --> 02:07:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2938
02:07:59.900 --> 02:08:00.733
<v Speaker 1>Because the difference between what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do on your own versus </v>

2939
02:08:03.051 --> 02:08:04.930
<v Speaker 1>what you're going to do in college are </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

2940
02:08:04.931 --> 02:08:05.764
<v Speaker 1>very different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2941
02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the question becomes,</v>

2942
02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:12.180
<v Speaker 1>is it healthy to take some 19 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid in the,</v>

2943
02:08:12.210 --> 02:08:13.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most promising and fun and exciting </v>

2944
02:08:15.381 --> 02:08:17.090
<v Speaker 1>moment of her life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2945
02:08:17.091 --> 02:08:17.924
<v Speaker 1>You're a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're leaving your parents' house and </v>

2946
02:08:21.110 --> 02:08:21.943
<v Speaker 1>burden them with some insane work load </v>
<v Speaker 1>of shit that they have to do to the </v>

2947
02:08:25.881 --> 02:08:26.714
<v Speaker 1>point where they're always stressed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're constantly dealing with tasks </v>

2948
02:08:29.231 --> 02:08:30.280
<v Speaker 1>are always turning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turning,</v>

2949
02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:31.850
<v Speaker 1>turning in papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always,</v>

2950
02:08:31.851 --> 02:08:33.290
<v Speaker 1>they always have to do research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always,</v>

2951
02:08:33.620 --> 02:08:37.320
<v Speaker 1>they're constantly working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at the workload of a,</v>

2952
02:08:37.321 --> 02:08:38.820
<v Speaker 1>a kid in college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2953
02:08:38.900 --> 02:08:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2954
02:08:39.590 --> 02:08:41.120
<v Speaker 1>it teaches them discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2955
02:08:41.121 --> 02:08:41.954
<v Speaker 1>It teaches them that it's hard out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to really figure out how </v>

2956
02:08:44.811 --> 02:08:46.610
<v Speaker 1>to push yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does all those things,</v>

2957
02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:50.480
<v Speaker 1>but it also robs them of a lot of fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

2958
02:08:50.481 --> 02:08:51.770
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In these years of their life.</v>

2959
02:08:51.771 --> 02:08:52.604
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not exactly sure if everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're learning and they're </v>

2960
02:08:55.701 --> 02:08:58.910
<v Speaker 1>spending all this time on is even ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be beneficial.</v>

2961
02:08:58.940 --> 02:08:59.511
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2962
02:08:59.511 --> 02:09:00.344
<v Speaker 1>the argument would be that most of it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking nonsense and you're never going </v>

2963
02:09:03.841 --> 02:09:04.860
<v Speaker 1>to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2964
02:09:06.230 --> 02:09:08.840
<v Speaker 1>And meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 19 you know,</v>

2965
02:09:08.841 --> 02:09:11.180
<v Speaker 1>and you should be having fun and </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoying the vitality.</v>

2966
02:09:11.490 --> 02:09:12.323
<v Speaker 2>Marion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at Pepperdine University in </v>

2967
02:09:13.281 --> 02:09:15.200
<v Speaker 2>Malibu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the first member of the first four</v>

2968
02:09:15.201 --> 02:09:16.034
<v Speaker 2>year graduating class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1976 classes 76 and I was at the jock </v>

2969
02:09:19.521 --> 02:09:20.354
<v Speaker 2>dorm with a bunch of baseball players </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tennis players and just just rowdy </v>

2970
02:09:23.511 --> 02:09:25.880
<v Speaker 2>guys and they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait to get out of college.</v>

2971
02:09:25.881 --> 02:09:27.170
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to get out there on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

2972
02:09:27.171 --> 02:09:29.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when are we ever going to live in Malibu</v>

2973
02:09:29.391 --> 02:09:29.901
<v Speaker 2>again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2974
02:09:29.901 --> 02:09:33.540
<v Speaker 2>here we are playing ping pong and he'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>go and just having,</v>

2975
02:09:33.650 --> 02:09:35.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the ocean Pacific Ocean is right</v>

2976
02:09:35.631 --> 02:09:37.490
<v Speaker 2>there and the gym and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2977
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:38.863
<v Speaker 2>unless you're oprah or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be living like this </v>

2978
02:09:41.181 --> 02:09:42.130
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2979
02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:45.800
<v Speaker 2>so true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That place isn't like the perfect spot.</v>

2980
02:09:46.190 --> 02:09:48.170
<v Speaker 2>He mentioned that land now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2981
02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:51.320
<v Speaker 2>Mrs ever bought that and gave it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>George Pepperdine,</v>

2982
02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:56.580
<v Speaker 2>the company that ran it at school and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 69 or something.</v>

2983
02:09:56.630 --> 02:10:00.260
<v Speaker 2>That chunk of land it at a Malibu Canyon</v>
<v Speaker 2>road and pch.</v>

2984
02:10:00.570 --> 02:10:02.600
<v Speaker 2>That'd probably be billions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2985
02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:03.513
<v Speaker 2>Probably will be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you stop and think about our mission </v>

2986
02:10:06.290 --> 02:10:09.940
<v Speaker 2>would let them build anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2987
02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Get 'em laker tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see this uh,</v>

2988
02:10:12.260 --> 02:10:13.093
<v Speaker 2>Itt Tech?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd mentioned trade schools that made </v>

2989
02:10:14.391 --> 02:10:15.224
<v Speaker 2>me think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This shit that happened like the last </v>

2990
02:10:16.401 --> 02:10:17.234
<v Speaker 2>two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got completely shut down by the </v>

2991
02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:19.993
<v Speaker 2>Department of Education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2992
02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:23.450
<v Speaker 2>Says former ITT tech students declared </v>
<v Speaker 2>debt strike.</v>

2993
02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:27.530
<v Speaker 2>I am stuck up to my neck in debt for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of my life and quote.</v>

2994
02:10:27.980 --> 02:10:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with the,</v>

2995
02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:32.660
<v Speaker 2>that my argument for tech schools are </v>
<v Speaker 2>good is a lot of them get,</v>

2996
02:10:32.690 --> 02:10:33.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2997
02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:38.140
<v Speaker 2>they turn into these diploma mills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically are for profit,</v>

2998
02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:39.051
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2999
02:10:39.051 --> 02:10:41.530
<v Speaker 2>To have a profit company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3000
02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:42.373
<v Speaker 2>for something like this and you end up </v>
<v Speaker 2>churning out students that can't get </v>

3001
02:10:44.811 --> 02:10:47.120
<v Speaker 2>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have this huge debt.</v>

3002
02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:48.403
<v Speaker 2>And they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason this is the story is because </v>

3003
02:10:49.521 --> 02:10:53.180
<v Speaker 2>the federal government was financing </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of their tuition.</v>

3004
02:10:53.780 --> 02:10:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out,</v>

3005
02:10:54.981 --> 02:10:57.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not quite a pyramid scheme,</v>

3006
02:10:57.051 --> 02:10:59.930
<v Speaker 2>but something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the government just said,</v>

3007
02:10:59.931 --> 02:11:01.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to do this anymore.</v>

3008
02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:02.153
<v Speaker 2>This is the tax dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now the students don't get the </v>

3009
02:11:04.491 --> 02:11:07.370
<v Speaker 2>financing anymore and the school is </v>
<v Speaker 2>still charging 50,000</v>

3010
02:11:07.371 --> 02:11:08.420
<v Speaker 2>a year or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3011
02:11:08.450 --> 02:11:10.190
<v Speaker 2>that's the end of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3012
02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:11.203
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of these private tech school or</v>
<v Speaker 2>just private schools in general depend </v>

3013
02:11:14.371 --> 02:11:17.990
<v Speaker 2>on federal government money through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>

3014
02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:18.973
<v Speaker 2>So they're not really for profit in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of we're competing in the </v>

3015
02:11:22.251 --> 02:11:24.650
<v Speaker 2>marketplace like apple versus ibm and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3016
02:11:24.651 --> 02:11:26.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best product will win.</v>

3017
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:28.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not like that they're getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidized,</v>

3018
02:11:28.821 --> 02:11:31.490
<v Speaker 2>heavily subsidized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavily subsidized,</v>

3019
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:34.730
<v Speaker 2>but yet the price is so elevated that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people can't afford it.</v>

3020
02:11:34.850 --> 02:11:35.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really crazy how much it costs to </v>

3021
02:11:36.941 --> 02:11:37.774
<v Speaker 2>get an education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I understand that it's expensive to </v>

3022
02:11:40.851 --> 02:11:43.580
<v Speaker 2>try to give someone an education is </v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive.</v>

3023
02:11:43.590 --> 02:11:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Try to run you university to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3024
02:11:46.011 --> 02:11:50.090
<v Speaker 2>people that are great teachers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>professors deserve a fair pay.</v>

3025
02:11:50.091 --> 02:11:50.924
<v Speaker 2>They deserve a lot of guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This article by David from u m in the </v>

3026
02:11:54.441 --> 02:11:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Atlantic atlantic.com,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3027
02:11:57.021 --> 02:11:57.854
<v Speaker 2>he published the other day on why </v>
<v Speaker 2>colleges are so expensive and he tracks </v>

3028
02:12:00.351 --> 02:12:04.520
<v Speaker 2>like the number of professors that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>increased over the last 50 years,</v>

3029
02:12:04.521 --> 02:12:05.354
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3030
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:07.790
<v Speaker 2>minor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3031
02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:11.830
<v Speaker 2>versus the number of administrators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deans and you know,</v>

3032
02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:15.110
<v Speaker 2>support a staff and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you scroll down a little bit,</v>

3033
02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:20.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see right there.</v>

3034
02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:21.313
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is a in California colleges </v>

3035
02:12:24.111 --> 02:12:27.830
<v Speaker 2>state university system from 11,600</v>
<v Speaker 2>to 12,000</v>

3036
02:12:27.831 --> 02:12:28.664
<v Speaker 2>professors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the number of administrators went </v>

3037
02:12:30.441 --> 02:12:32.740
<v Speaker 2>from 3000 to 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

3038
02:12:32.780 --> 02:12:34.850
<v Speaker 2>That's the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know you're paying,</v>

3039
02:12:34.851 --> 02:12:35.684
<v Speaker 2>those are full time jobs and they all </v>
<v Speaker 2>have healthcare and benefits and </v>

3040
02:12:38.181 --> 02:12:41.410
<v Speaker 2>retirement and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's where the expenses is.</v>

3041
02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

3042
02:12:42.230 --> 02:12:45.560
<v Speaker 2>not in the actual teaching you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a brain,</v>

3043
02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:47.480
<v Speaker 2>a professor with a brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3044
02:12:47.481 --> 02:12:49.970
<v Speaker 2>sending the ideas of the brains of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>students in the classroom.</v>

3045
02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:51.860
<v Speaker 2>It's all of the support structure around</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3046
02:12:52.490 --> 02:12:53.323
<v Speaker 2>Not to mention these gyms and dorms and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cafeterias that are now nice </v>

3047
02:12:57.531 --> 02:12:58.281
<v Speaker 2>restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3048
02:12:58.281 --> 02:13:00.620
<v Speaker 2>all that's expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is hilarious.</v>

3049
02:13:00.621 --> 02:13:03.620
<v Speaker 2>Listen to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today's New York Times offers one modest</v>

3050
02:13:03.621 --> 02:13:04.454
<v Speaker 2>illustration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over the past 18 months at time reports </v>

3051

<v Speaker 2>and 90 American colleges and </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities have hired chief diversity </v>

3052
02:13:10.700 --> 02:13:11.533
<v Speaker 2>officers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These administrators who are hired in </v>

3053
02:13:14.541 --> 02:13:15.374
<v Speaker 2>response to the wave of racial incidents</v>
<v Speaker 2>that con convulsed convulsed campuses </v>

3054
02:13:20.691 --> 02:13:22.760
<v Speaker 2>like the University of Missouri over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past year,</v>

3055
02:13:23.110 --> 02:13:26.540
<v Speaker 2>they are hooking up at an already </v>
<v Speaker 2>thriving industry.</v>

3056
02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>March,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Francisco.</v>

3059
02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:38.430
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious attendance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Set a new record,</v>

3060
02:13:38.580 --> 02:13:43.580
<v Speaker 3>370 the association publishes a journal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It bestows awards of excellence that,</v>

3061
02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:50.580
<v Speaker 3>that fucking thing in the University of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Missouri was a shocking insight into how</v>

3062
02:13:50.581 --> 02:13:51.414
<v Speaker 3>college is really working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That lady was yelling at that student </v>

3063
02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:58.890
<v Speaker 3>who was a photographer who was his job </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

3064
02:13:58.950 --> 02:13:59.783
<v Speaker 3>he was working for this little Melissa </v>
<v Speaker 3>Click was the professor of </v>

3065
02:14:01.801 --> 02:14:03.060
<v Speaker 3>communications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3066
02:14:03.061 --> 02:14:06.120
<v Speaker 3>Which is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy was an espn reporter,</v>

3067
02:14:06.630 --> 02:14:07.463
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sent there to cover the protests they </v>

3068
02:14:09.211 --> 02:14:11.950
<v Speaker 3>were going to have and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a professor of communication.</v>

3069
02:14:11.951 --> 02:14:14.850
<v Speaker 3>Say No press.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

3070
02:14:14.851 --> 02:14:18.000
<v Speaker 3>she asked for muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where it got really offensive.</v>

3071
02:14:18.001 --> 02:14:19.740
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you a goon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

3072
02:14:19.741 --> 02:14:21.530
<v Speaker 3>you want to bring in the gun and you see</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

3073
02:14:21.550 --> 02:14:24.480
<v Speaker 3>she comes up and knocks the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's this,</v>

3074
02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:26.340
<v Speaker 3>this self righteous.</v>

3075
02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3076
02:14:27.070 --> 02:14:30.090
<v Speaker 3>and this lack of understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There she is.</v>

3077
02:14:30.091 --> 02:14:30.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a click.</v>

3078
02:14:30.891 --> 02:14:31.724
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lack of understanding how other </v>

3079
02:14:33.661 --> 02:14:34.494
<v Speaker 3>people are perceiving what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the possibility that what you're </v>

3080
02:14:36.571 --> 02:14:38.130
<v Speaker 3>doing is not cool at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3081
02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:41.700
<v Speaker 3>But this idea of having this safe space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what this is college like,</v>

3082
02:14:41.701 --> 02:14:44.150
<v Speaker 3>what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like let's explore what happened here.</v>

3083
02:14:44.170 --> 02:14:46.110
<v Speaker 3>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was his racial incident?</v>

3084
02:14:46.230 --> 02:14:47.063
<v Speaker 3>And let's get to the heart of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's not get angry at some guy who's </v>

3085
02:14:49.531 --> 02:14:53.490
<v Speaker 3>taking a picture of things and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>photographing things like you are openly</v>

3086
02:14:53.580 --> 02:14:55.740
<v Speaker 3>protesting in a public place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3087
02:14:55.741 --> 02:14:57.630
<v Speaker 3>I would assume you want attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3088
02:14:57.640 --> 02:14:59.220
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole point of part of it.</v>

3089
02:14:59.221 --> 02:15:00.054
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this idea that you can get some guy </v>

3090
02:15:02.161 --> 02:15:06.090
<v Speaker 3>and hit his camera right when he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a crazy person,</v>

3091
02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:08.240
<v Speaker 3>but it's a person who is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

3092
02:15:08.250 --> 02:15:09.180
<v Speaker 3>they have too much power.</v>

3093
02:15:09.250 --> 02:15:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's too much authority.</v>

3094
02:15:11.370 --> 02:15:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the good side,</v>

3095
02:15:12.241 --> 02:15:14.880
<v Speaker 3>she was fired and appealed and lust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she's out.</v>

3096
02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:16.590
<v Speaker 3>That is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's good.</v>

3097
02:15:16.591 --> 02:15:17.091
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3098
02:15:17.091 --> 02:15:19.950
<v Speaker 3>and sad that she got to that just in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last two weeks,</v>

3099
02:15:19.951 --> 02:15:23.630
<v Speaker 3>the one of the deans at the University </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Chicago sent that letter out.</v>

3100
02:15:23.650 --> 02:15:28.140
<v Speaker 3>Now everyone's read it went viral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tall it class of 2020 no safe spaces,</v>

3101
02:15:28.141 --> 02:15:30.510
<v Speaker 3>no microaggressions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not disadvantaging speakers.</v>

3102
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:34.160
<v Speaker 3>You gotta grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3103
02:15:34.530 --> 02:15:37.460
<v Speaker 3>where I teach at Chapman University,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3104
02:15:37.470 --> 02:15:39.210
<v Speaker 3>I sent that letter to the president and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3105
02:15:39.211 --> 02:15:39.750
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>

3106
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:41.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we should do something like that.</v>

3107
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:42.750
<v Speaker 3>And at first he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3108
02:15:42.751 --> 02:15:43.501
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3109
02:15:43.501 --> 02:15:45.630
<v Speaker 3>we don't really have a problem with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>here at Chapman.</v>

3110
02:15:45.631 --> 02:15:46.890
<v Speaker 3>Everything's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to start there.</v>

3111
02:15:47.220 --> 02:15:50.550
<v Speaker 3>And then he decided he'd do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he did it and then they orange county</v>

3112
02:15:50.551 --> 02:15:51.750
<v Speaker 3>register published it.</v>

3113
02:15:51.780 --> 02:15:53.010
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is great.</v>

3114
02:15:53.130 --> 02:15:53.963
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my first week of class last week to my </v>

3115
02:15:55.441 --> 02:15:56.700
<v Speaker 3>students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we read it,</v>

3116
02:15:56.820 --> 02:15:57.780
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is it.</v>

3117
02:15:57.890 --> 02:16:00.240
<v Speaker 3>There is no safe spaces here on Chapman </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so on.</v>

3118
02:16:00.540 --> 02:16:03.030
<v Speaker 3>You're adults now and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they seem fine with that.</v>

3119
02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:04.493
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you set up a system of sort of a </v>

3120
02:16:06.781 --> 02:16:07.614
<v Speaker 3>moral panic and you start looking for </v>
<v Speaker 3>any racial slurs or slights or it makes </v>

3121
02:16:13.411 --> 02:16:16.380
<v Speaker 3>conversation really hazardous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3122
02:16:16.410 --> 02:16:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to navigate around that.</v>

3123
02:16:17.971 --> 02:16:19.950
<v Speaker 3>I better not use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I better be very careful.</v>

3124
02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:22.740
<v Speaker 3>And all of a sudden it just shuts people</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

3125
02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:24.990
<v Speaker 3>It becomes like Mccarthyism for </v>
<v Speaker 3>morality,</v>

3126
02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:25.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>

3127
02:16:25.981 --> 02:16:29.530
<v Speaker 3>you start looking for people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>violators of it and like all these other</v>

3128
02:16:29.531 --> 02:16:30.364
<v Speaker 3>things that we've discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a spectrum and there's people </v>

3129
02:16:32.291 --> 02:16:37.291
<v Speaker 3>that are on the extreme far fringe who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are literally recreationally outraged at</v>

3130
02:16:38.231 --> 02:16:42.100
<v Speaker 3>everything they see all throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world without no perspective at all.</v>

3131
02:16:42.220 --> 02:16:43.053
<v Speaker 3>And instead of being able to look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things and try to see things from </v>

3132
02:16:46.961 --> 02:16:48.610
<v Speaker 3>other people's points of view and </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

3133
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.863
<v Speaker 3>every single thing becomes a racist or </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchal or homophobic or </v>

3134
02:16:54.581 --> 02:16:55.414
<v Speaker 3>transphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's all these different new </v>

3135
02:16:57.701 --> 02:17:02.701
<v Speaker 3>phrases that get abelist and fat shaming</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these different trigger warnings</v>

3136
02:17:03.730 --> 02:17:07.330
<v Speaker 3>that they would like on almost every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it just becomes this ridiculous nerf</v>

3137
02:17:07.331 --> 02:17:08.164
<v Speaker 3>dup environment that you're living in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you're in school and you're </v>

3138
02:17:11.471 --> 02:17:13.840
<v Speaker 3>preparing for the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3139
02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:14.733
<v Speaker 3>If you really think that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get through school with all this </v>

3140
02:17:18.611 --> 02:17:19.444
<v Speaker 3>craziness about safe spaces and certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that trigger you and what should </v>

3141
02:17:23.441 --> 02:17:26.080
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what should be legal and you know,</v>

3142
02:17:26.110 --> 02:17:26.943
<v Speaker 3>cultural appropriation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white people shouldn't be wearing </v>

3143
02:17:28.631 --> 02:17:31.390
<v Speaker 3>dreadlocks and all that nonsense that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're showing these kids.</v>

3144
02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:32.613
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy to assume that you can get </v>

3145
02:17:35.951 --> 02:17:36.784
<v Speaker 3>through that and then become a </v>
<v Speaker 3>functioning member of society and work </v>

3146
02:17:40.061 --> 02:17:42.910
<v Speaker 3>with 40 year old people who think you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>retarded.</v>

3147
02:17:42.970 --> 02:17:46.180
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm giving a talk next week at cal state</v>

3148
02:17:46.181 --> 02:17:47.014
<v Speaker 3>fullerton on this very subject because </v>
<v Speaker 3>last year the sorority got in trouble </v>

3149
02:17:50.111 --> 02:17:52.270
<v Speaker 3>because they held a taco Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3150
02:17:52.271 --> 02:17:53.104
<v Speaker 3>I saw that cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that really part of it is I think </v>

3151
02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:01.530
<v Speaker 3>the lack of realization that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3152
02:18:01.630 --> 02:18:03.460
<v Speaker 3>that there just are assholes in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

3153
02:18:03.461 --> 02:18:05.860
<v Speaker 3>People there are just bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nasty people or whatever.</v>

3154
02:18:06.190 --> 02:18:07.690
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you deal with them?</v>

3155
02:18:08.170 --> 02:18:11.500
<v Speaker 3>So like a Chapman for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last year that the Lgbtq,</v>

3156
02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:13.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a community and a,</v>

3157
02:18:13.991 --> 02:18:16.000
<v Speaker 3>these are new new ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lgbt.</v>

3158
02:18:16.001 --> 02:18:20.530
<v Speaker 3>So the cue is questioning or queer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was just queer.</v>

3159
02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:21.311
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3160
02:18:21.311 --> 02:18:24.250
<v Speaker 3>no question in case you're not sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he shouldn't.</v>

3161
02:18:24.251 --> 02:18:25.084
<v Speaker 3>We have two queues just so we don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>discriminate between the poor and the </v>

3162
02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:29.110
<v Speaker 3>questionnaires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3163
02:18:29.180 --> 02:18:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Let's make that so please people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's not be insensitive.</v>

3164
02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:34.470
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think intersectionality,</v>

3165
02:18:34.970 --> 02:18:36.270
<v Speaker 3>intersectionality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3166
02:18:37.510 --> 02:18:39.070
<v Speaker 3>have you seen between sec there?</v>

3167
02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:40.990
<v Speaker 3>I think that's for the biological.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>

3168
02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:41.853
<v Speaker 3>you have a different genitals and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like you should have or something </v>

3169
02:18:45.671 --> 02:18:47.530
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen pansexual?</v>

3170
02:18:47.950 --> 02:18:48.783
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that was a woman who was a </v>

3171
02:18:49.781 --> 02:18:51.760
<v Speaker 3>congressperson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she was.</v>

3172
02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Who came out as pansexual?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what she was?</v>

3173
02:18:54.641 --> 02:18:55.870
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she wasn't a congressman.</v>

3174
02:18:55.871 --> 02:18:57.250
<v Speaker 3>She's a state representative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

3175
02:18:57.550 --> 02:18:59.880
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck does she do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She came out as pan sex.</v>

3176
02:18:59.881 --> 02:19:02.590
<v Speaker 3>The first pansexual politician.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3177
02:19:03.310 --> 02:19:04.320
<v Speaker 3>What is pansexual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

3178
02:19:04.321 --> 02:19:05.154
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it means you're,</v>

3179
02:19:05.170 --> 02:19:07.560
<v Speaker 3>I think it's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a freak.</v>

3180
02:19:07.561 --> 02:19:11.200
<v Speaker 3>You're a little bit of Mary Gonzales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas state representative identifies as</v>

3181
02:19:11.201 --> 02:19:16.201
<v Speaker 3>pansexual in new interview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my goodness.</v>

3182
02:19:18.570 --> 02:19:20.320
<v Speaker 3>Don't believe in a gender binary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>

3183
02:19:20.321 --> 02:19:21.610
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not No gender by,</v>

3184
02:19:21.850 --> 02:19:24.700
<v Speaker 3>so this is called CSS,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so sexist,</v>

3185
02:19:24.910 --> 02:19:28.430
<v Speaker 3>Hetero Patriarchy that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's only two</v>

3186
02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:29.293
<v Speaker 2>men and women and that that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminatory because there's people </v>

3187
02:19:32.061 --> 02:19:33.950
<v Speaker 2>that are in between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are.</v>

3188
02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:36.170
<v Speaker 2>I think there definitely are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>

3189
02:19:36.470 --> 02:19:37.303
<v Speaker 2>there's people that have different </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of intelligence as people that </v>

3190
02:19:40.521 --> 02:19:42.680
<v Speaker 2>are shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people that have different,</v>

3191
02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.100
<v Speaker 2>different levels of sexual desire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

3192
02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:52.040
<v Speaker 2>and there's gotta be people that are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the borderline between a man and a woman</v>

3193
02:19:52.041 --> 02:19:52.874
<v Speaker 2>and they choose to do either or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of him as fuzzy sets with a </v>

3194
02:19:55.941 --> 02:19:57.750
<v Speaker 2>little bit of overlapping on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>borders,</v>

3195
02:19:57.770 --> 02:19:59.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people are in one or the other.</v>

3196
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people in between.</v>

3197
02:20:01.490 --> 02:20:02.323

<v Speaker 2>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

3199
02:20:03.621 --> 02:20:05.600
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't discriminate.</v>

3200
02:20:05.601 --> 02:20:06.434
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3202
02:20:07.611 --> 02:20:08.444
<v Speaker 2>don't say to an Asian person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must be good at math because you're </v>

3203

3205
02:20:14.820 --> 02:20:18.800
<v Speaker 2>But isn't that compliment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you see a black eye and he say,</v>

3206
02:20:18.801 --> 02:20:20.510
<v Speaker 2>you must have a big Dick because you're </v>

<v Speaker 2>you must be a genius.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What's the problem?</v>

3242
02:21:49.970 --> 02:21:50.803
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were some incidences against </v>

<v Speaker 2>Lgbtqa people here on campus.</v>

<v Speaker 2>once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once a year.</v>

02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:06.140
<v Speaker 2>What's the rate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't know.</v>

3249
02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:07.800
<v Speaker 2>We don't have any data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3250
02:22:07.810 --> 02:22:11.000
<v Speaker 2>it is it worse now as much worse?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3251
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:13.460
<v Speaker 2>how many times did it happen last year </v>
<v Speaker 2>or five years ago?</v>

3252
02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:15.590
<v Speaker 2>We don't have any data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know it's worse?</v>

3253
02:22:16.250 --> 02:22:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of feels worse,</v>

3254
02:22:17.541 --> 02:22:19.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we get more emails.</v>

3255
02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:21.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's meaningless.</v>

3256
02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it was like,</v>

3257
02:22:23.151 --> 02:22:23.984
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like give me some incidences like w </v>

3258
02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 2>examples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

3259
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:27.510
<v Speaker 3>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3260
02:22:27.511 --> 02:22:29.670
<v Speaker 3>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard about this gay couple.</v>

3261
02:22:29.671 --> 02:22:30.504
<v Speaker 3>They were walking hand in hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of on the perimeter of the campus </v>

3262
02:22:32.551 --> 02:22:33.384
<v Speaker 3>down the sidewalk of the local street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some guy in a pickup truck drove by </v>

3263
02:22:35.671 --> 02:22:38.360
<v Speaker 3>and made a remark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said that,</v>

3264
02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:40.030
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3265
02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:40.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just,</v>

3266
02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:42.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are assholes driving around,</v>

3267
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:44.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

3268
02:22:44.461 --> 02:22:45.294
<v Speaker 3>you're never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's never going to be zero and </v>

3269
02:22:46.711 --> 02:22:47.544
<v Speaker 3>there's no place you're going to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're going to be safe from that </v>

3270
02:22:49.411 --> 02:22:51.540
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the question,</v>

3271
02:22:51.541 --> 02:22:53.290
<v Speaker 3>how do you deal with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3272
02:22:53.330 --> 02:22:55.050
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just say fuck off asshole,</v>

3273
02:22:55.051 --> 02:22:57.420
<v Speaker 3>or just ignore him or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3274
02:22:57.421 --> 02:22:59.610
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of I'm hurt,</v>

3275
02:22:59.611 --> 02:23:01.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm injured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm damaged,</v>

3276
02:23:02.030 --> 02:23:02.863
<v Speaker 3>and I have to go and meet with my people</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we talk about how it hurt and </v>

3277
02:23:05.671 --> 02:23:06.090
<v Speaker 3>damaged.</v>

3278
02:23:06.090 --> 02:23:10.180
<v Speaker 3>We feel that's gonna make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to turn,</v>

3279
02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:11.783
<v Speaker 3>not a non problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a minuscule problem into a big </v>

3280
02:23:14.461 --> 02:23:15.900
<v Speaker 3>problem that doesn't need to be that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

3281
02:23:15.930 --> 02:23:17.460
<v Speaker 3>That that's my opinion of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3282
02:23:17.461 --> 02:23:18.294
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're really generalizing here because </v>

3283
02:23:20.701 --> 02:23:21.534
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what this supposedly </v>

3284
02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:24.730
<v Speaker 3>aggressor said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3285
02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:26.790
<v Speaker 3>And there's a bunch of different things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that could have said,</v>

3286
02:23:27.150 --> 02:23:28.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could have drove by and go,</v>

3287
02:23:28.471 --> 02:23:32.070
<v Speaker 3>I love your hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then just kept going like this piece</v>

3288
02:23:32.071 --> 02:23:33.900
<v Speaker 3>of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just totally gender,</v>

3289
02:23:34.270 --> 02:23:35.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the dominoes,</v>

3290
02:23:35.970 --> 02:23:36.781
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3291
02:23:36.781 --> 02:23:41.010
<v Speaker 3>Of course there's some preposterous </v>
<v Speaker 3>recreational outrage that really,</v>

3292
02:23:41.370 --> 02:23:43.980
<v Speaker 3>on one hand it's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>

3293
02:23:44.010 --> 02:23:46.470
<v Speaker 3>what's bad about it is it's indulgent </v>
<v Speaker 3>and silly.</v>

3294
02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:47.333
<v Speaker 3>But what's also bad about it is it </v>
<v Speaker 3>develops this cry wolf mentality where </v>

3295
02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:55.860
<v Speaker 3>when you see people getting offended by </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are so fucking ridiculous,</v>

3296
02:23:56.220 --> 02:24:00.330
<v Speaker 3>you will almost be willing to dismiss </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything on their team.</v>

3297
02:24:00.660 --> 02:24:01.493
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that they're trying to push </v>

3298
02:24:02.401 --> 02:24:04.800
<v Speaker 3>forth at some of the things might have </v>
<v Speaker 3>some merit to them.</v>

3299
02:24:04.801 --> 02:24:06.420
<v Speaker 3>Some of the things might be really </v>
<v Speaker 3>valid,</v>

3300
02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:08.700
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's all in the same camp,</v>

3301
02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:09.713
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These ridiculous over sensitive people </v>

3302
02:24:12.571 --> 02:24:15.330
<v Speaker 3>that are looking to get recreational </v>
<v Speaker 3>outreach all the time.</v>

3303
02:24:15.331 --> 02:24:16.164
<v Speaker 3>So they might attach themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 3>really legitimate points that people </v>

3304
02:24:18.661 --> 02:24:20.310
<v Speaker 3>that might be more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3305
02:24:20.610 --> 02:24:25.080
<v Speaker 3>sort of a more rigid or conservative in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their ideology.</v>

3306
02:24:25.081 --> 02:24:26.850
<v Speaker 3>They rejected outright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

3307
02:24:26.851 --> 02:24:29.020
<v Speaker 3>won't even consider it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>these fucking dummies.</v>

3308
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.970
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're,</v>

3309
02:24:30.030 --> 02:24:30.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3310
02:24:30.601 --> 02:24:34.170
<v Speaker 3>they're crazy outrage and there's safe </v>
<v Speaker 3>spaces like these people,</v>

3311
02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:37.680
<v Speaker 3>they might be attached to some really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good ideas about how,</v>

3312
02:24:37.890 --> 02:24:38.723
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's not a good idea to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of guys on your campus yelling </v>

3313
02:24:42.031 --> 02:24:42.864
<v Speaker 3>shit out at girls as they walk by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe we can figure out how to stop </v>

3314
02:24:45.511 --> 02:24:46.110
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3315
02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:47.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's right.</v>

3316
02:24:47.031 --> 02:24:49.800
<v Speaker 3>So all of these have little kernel of </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth and moral progress.</v>

3317
02:24:49.801 --> 02:24:50.790
<v Speaker 3>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it happens,</v>

3318
02:24:50.791 --> 02:24:51.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom up,</v>

3319
02:24:51.541 --> 02:24:56.360
<v Speaker 3>change language and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it starts off well intentioned that.</v>

3320
02:24:56.430 --> 02:24:58.320
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do when somebody,</v>

3321
02:24:58.340 --> 02:24:59.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>says something offensive,</v>

3322
02:24:59.820 --> 02:25:00.653
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3323
02:25:00.690 --> 02:25:01.523
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we turn it into a massive campus </v>

3324
02:25:02.641 --> 02:25:05.760
<v Speaker 3>crisis or do you just say to the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3325
02:25:05.790 --> 02:25:06.930
<v Speaker 3>that's not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just feel,</v>

3326
02:25:06.931 --> 02:25:08.880
<v Speaker 3>say that kind of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not acceptable.</v>

3327
02:25:08.910 --> 02:25:09.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like the,</v>

3328
02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:10.833
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Halloween costume incident at Yale </v>

3329
02:25:12.691 --> 02:25:14.370
<v Speaker 3>last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3330
02:25:14.670 --> 02:25:15.480
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3331
02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:16.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3332
02:25:16.020 --> 02:25:16.853
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the faculty members sent out that email </v>

3333
02:25:18.511 --> 02:25:19.230
<v Speaker 3>that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3334
02:25:19.230 --> 02:25:20.063
<v Speaker 3>you're adults,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to tell you what </v>

3335
02:25:20.701 --> 02:25:23.250
<v Speaker 3>costumes you can and cannot wear and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this erupted.</v>

3336
02:25:23.350 --> 02:25:23.801
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3337
02:25:23.801 --> 02:25:26.500
<v Speaker 3>what if somebody shows up in blackface?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3338
02:25:26.501 --> 02:25:27.380
<v Speaker 3>I'll admit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3339
02:25:27.430 --> 02:25:30.110
<v Speaker 3>somebody shows up in black face at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Halloween party that's,</v>

3340
02:25:30.130 --> 02:25:30.963
<v Speaker 3>that's getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of pushing the touristic </v>

3341
02:25:32.100 --> 02:25:32.620
<v Speaker 3>move.</v>

3342
02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:35.740
<v Speaker 3>You can see your Al Jolson though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3343
02:25:35.741 --> 02:25:39.340
<v Speaker 3>but if you have a Mexican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a Sombrero,</v>

3344
02:25:39.341 --> 02:25:42.070
<v Speaker 3>are you dressed up as a native American?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean really.</v>

3345
02:25:42.071 --> 02:25:44.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's sort of scales from offensive</v>

3346
02:25:44.501 --> 02:25:45.880
<v Speaker 3>to you inoffensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3347
02:25:45.881 --> 02:25:49.240
<v Speaker 3>is it more offensive to wear black face </v>
<v Speaker 3>than it is to wear red face?</v>

3348
02:25:49.270 --> 02:25:51.840
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it seems to be that can,</v>

3349
02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:53.890
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of get away with red face </v>
<v Speaker 3>till,</v>

3350
02:25:53.891 --> 02:25:55.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3351
02:25:55.211 --> 02:25:56.340
<v Speaker 3>well the Redskins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3352
02:25:56.530 --> 02:25:59.290
<v Speaker 3>probably not after we talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll pass some new rules.</v>

3353
02:25:59.890 --> 02:26:01.540
<v Speaker 3>We have to sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but side,</v>

3354
02:26:01.541 --> 02:26:03.430
<v Speaker 3>what are you upset about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But why not just,</v>

3355
02:26:03.431 --> 02:26:05.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are adults we don't need to tell,</v>

3356
02:26:05.051 --> 02:26:07.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell them how to play in the sandbox.</v>

3357
02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Just ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your cat called,</v>

3358
02:26:11.060 --> 02:26:11.893
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just tell the guy shut the fuck up or </v>

3359
02:26:13.571 --> 02:26:17.830
<v Speaker 3>fuck off or just ignore them well and </v>
<v Speaker 3>got and tell the guy guy should be too.</v>

3360
02:26:17.831 --> 02:26:19.110
<v Speaker 3>You know guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you want to,</v>

3361
02:26:19.130 --> 02:26:21.670
<v Speaker 3>you want to get laid cat calling a woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3362
02:26:21.780 --> 02:26:24.090
<v Speaker 3>it's going to have the opposite effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you never know.</v>

3363
02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:26.430
<v Speaker 3>Don't do some freaks out there and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>might call them in.</v>

3364
02:26:26.980 --> 02:26:30.520
<v Speaker 3>Well I call them and look at elk call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any data on that.</v>

3365
02:26:30.521 --> 02:26:33.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid this freaks to freak studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>

3366
02:26:33.791 --> 02:26:36.460
<v Speaker 3>They've done some studies on freaks </v>
<v Speaker 3>journal or Freak beat.</v>

3367
02:26:37.030 --> 02:26:38.020
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I'm joking,</v>

3368
02:26:38.220 --> 02:26:42.090
<v Speaker 1>but I think that when we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the difference between those films</v>

3369
02:26:42.091 --> 02:26:42.924
<v Speaker 1>that we watched these men beat the shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of women and it was like just so </v>

3370
02:26:45.091 --> 02:26:45.924
<v Speaker 1>standard and the outliers like when a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person does show up on campus and the </v>

3371
02:26:49.011 --> 02:26:51.090
<v Speaker 1>yell out sexist things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like whoa.</v>

3372
02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an outrageous thing because it's</v>

3373
02:26:53.341 --> 02:26:55.570
<v Speaker 1>so rare because there has been progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3374
02:26:55.580 --> 02:26:56.413
<v Speaker 1>So even though I think that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the recreational outrage </v>

3375
02:26:59.611 --> 02:27:00.444
<v Speaker 1>community are outrageously stupid in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their efforts to make everything in a </v>

3376
02:27:03.411 --> 02:27:04.244
<v Speaker 1>offense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the pressure of all that </v>

3377
02:27:05.851 --> 02:27:10.851
<v Speaker 1>craziness actually somehow can probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>tone things down like the,</v>

3378
02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:14.310
<v Speaker 1>if the left gets so outrageous in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>demands,</v>

3379
02:27:14.311 --> 02:27:15.144
<v Speaker 1>the right kind of meets some somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of [inaudible] get to </v>

3380
02:27:16.681 --> 02:27:18.270
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but settle the fuck down,</v>

3381
02:27:18.300 --> 02:27:18.841
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3382
02:27:18.841 --> 02:27:20.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll call Caitlyn Jenner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kaitlin,</v>

3383
02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:22.093
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's just relax on doing that to </v>

3384
02:27:24.031 --> 02:27:24.864
<v Speaker 1>six year olds.</v>

3385
02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:25.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3386
02:27:25.921 --> 02:27:26.754
<v Speaker 1>let's figure out a comfortable medium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in becoming more and more </v>

3387
02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:32.850
<v Speaker 1>tolerant as time goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll just be the norm.</v>

3388
02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Just like slapping people in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies was normal in 1960.</v>

3389
02:27:36.931 --> 02:27:38.460
<v Speaker 1>But in today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's outrageous.</v>

3390
02:27:38.461 --> 02:27:41.010
<v Speaker 1>And in a television show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to the moon,</v>

3391
02:27:41.011 --> 02:27:43.080
<v Speaker 1>alice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a new guy,</v>

3392
02:27:43.290 --> 02:27:44.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

3393
02:27:44.170 --> 02:27:45.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3394
02:27:45.271 --> 02:27:48.660
<v Speaker 1>some Kevin James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin James is in some new sitcom.</v>

3395
02:27:48.750 --> 02:27:50.340
<v Speaker 1>We threatened to beat the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife,</v>

3396
02:27:50.370 --> 02:27:50.881
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3397
02:27:50.881 --> 02:27:51.714
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long would that show stay on the </v>

3398
02:27:53.330 --> 02:27:55.350
<v Speaker 1>air?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been progress made.</v>

3399
02:27:55.351 --> 02:27:56.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

3400
02:27:56.041 --> 02:27:57.360
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3401
02:27:57.361 --> 02:27:58.194
<v Speaker 1>people getting outrageously upset about </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that merit being outrageously </v>

3402
02:28:02.341 --> 02:28:04.320
<v Speaker 1>upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes everybody think,</v>

3403
02:28:04.321 --> 02:28:05.154
<v Speaker 1>but when people were outrageously upset </v>
<v Speaker 1>about someone having a fucking Taco </v>

3404
02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3405
02:28:09.780 --> 02:28:10.613
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or trying to cut some white dudes </v>

3406
02:28:12.631 --> 02:28:14.250
<v Speaker 1>dreadlocks off like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3407
02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:15.353
<v Speaker 1>you're losing me here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going too far going too far the </v>

3408
02:28:17.851 --> 02:28:18.180
<v Speaker 1>other way.</v>

3409
02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:19.350
<v Speaker 1>You're not reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3410
02:28:19.390 --> 02:28:21.680
<v Speaker 1>You look at and get pissed off over </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

3411
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:23.113
<v Speaker 1>Like there's things to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear about that kid who got away </v>

3412
02:28:24.891 --> 02:28:29.891
<v Speaker 1>with raping some girl and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl had been passed out and he only</v>

3413
02:28:30.591 --> 02:28:35.591
<v Speaker 1>got six months and now that six months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is something to be erased.</v>

3414
02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:37.393
<v Speaker 1>That's a real scary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you should be really pissed off </v>

3415
02:28:40.101 --> 02:28:43.250
<v Speaker 1>about not Taco fucking Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3416
02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:44.533
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that hurts the cause of real </v>

3417
02:28:46.430 --> 02:28:47.263
<v Speaker 1>injustices that need to be corrected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they get lumped in with the silly </v>

3418
02:28:50.571 --> 02:28:51.404
<v Speaker 1>stuff and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to get away from binary </v>

3419
02:28:54.470 --> 02:28:56.650
<v Speaker 1>thinking to scale thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3420
02:28:56.980 --> 02:28:58.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a spectrum.</v>

3421
02:28:58.520 --> 02:28:59.353
<v Speaker 1>And choosing gender teams too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a real issue because there's </v>

3422
02:29:02.001 --> 02:29:02.834
<v Speaker 1>pieces of shit on the male side and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really fucking questionable </v>

3423
02:29:06.141 --> 02:29:07.550
<v Speaker 1>people in the female side too.</v>

3424
02:29:07.550 --> 02:29:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that mattress girl thing.</v>

3425
02:29:09.340 --> 02:29:11.240
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know where this Columbia,</v>

3426
02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:12.113
<v Speaker 1>you guys suing the school now she </v>
<v Speaker 1>collected her diploma with a mattress </v>

3427
02:29:15.950 --> 02:29:17.930
<v Speaker 1>and we don't know what happened because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we weren't there,</v>

3428
02:29:17.931 --> 02:29:22.010
<v Speaker 1>but there's some crazy texts exchanged </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth where she's asking him to</v>

3429
02:29:22.011 --> 02:29:24.050
<v Speaker 1>come over and find her in the ass or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

3430
02:29:24.051 --> 02:29:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that what she said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I make that up?</v>

3431
02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly find that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get sued.</v>

3432
02:29:28.490 --> 02:29:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Super important that you be real clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3433
02:29:31.011 --> 02:29:35.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it really is something like that.</v>

3434
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:36.590
<v Speaker 1>What was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3435
02:29:36.591 --> 02:29:39.950
<v Speaker 1>the false rape accusation that made it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the New York Times or excuse me,</v>

3436
02:29:39.951 --> 02:29:41.690
<v Speaker 1>a rolling stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Rolling Stone,</v>

3437
02:29:42.410 --> 02:29:44.020
<v Speaker 1>was it Virginia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3438
02:29:44.090 --> 02:29:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3439
02:29:46.460 --> 02:29:47.293
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when something gets to the point </v>

3440
02:29:48.801 --> 02:29:49.634
<v Speaker 1>where it's in rolling stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a complete total fabrication like </v>

3441
02:29:51.651 --> 02:29:52.484
<v Speaker 1>that where somebody just made something </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and it didn't go through the proper </v>

3442
02:29:55.011 --> 02:29:55.844
<v Speaker 1>channels because everything with dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with gender and all these issues that </v>

3443
02:29:58.911 --> 02:29:59.744
<v Speaker 1>are super sensitive issues gets treated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with kid gloves instead of approaching </v>

3444
02:30:02.721 --> 02:30:03.554
<v Speaker 1>it with the same kind of skepticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would up murder case or a case of </v>

3445
02:30:07.701 --> 02:30:08.520
<v Speaker 1>theft.</v>

3446
02:30:08.520 --> 02:30:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Instead it gets immediately looked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's one possible scenario here.</v>

3447
02:30:14.540 --> 02:30:17.210
<v Speaker 1>This woman has been victimized to </v>
<v Speaker 1>question her would be horrific.</v>

3448
02:30:17.240 --> 02:30:18.073
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you shouldn't even observe the </v>

3449
02:30:18.741 --> 02:30:20.630
<v Speaker 1>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shouldn't even have an open mind.</v>

3450
02:30:20.810 --> 02:30:21.643
<v Speaker 1>You have to go into it with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you really don't have any </v>

3451
02:30:24.021 --> 02:30:26.330
<v Speaker 1>information really whatsoever other than</v>
<v Speaker 1>people talking,</v>

3452
02:30:26.450 --> 02:30:27.283
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to go into it with this idea </v>

3453
02:30:28.041 --> 02:30:29.750
<v Speaker 1>that this person talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's telling you the truth.</v>

3454
02:30:29.751 --> 02:30:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're blaming the victim.</v>

3455
02:30:31.880 --> 02:30:32.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's shocked.</v>

3456
02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Fuck me in the butt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

3457
02:30:34.430 --> 02:30:35.263
<v Speaker 1>I got nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said bluntly during one facebook </v>

3458
02:30:37.131 --> 02:30:38.120
<v Speaker 1>exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

3459
02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:39.373
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if someone sends you a text like </v>

3460
02:30:41.811 --> 02:30:42.644
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that you're allowed to </v>

3461
02:30:42.951 --> 02:30:43.784
<v Speaker 1>rape them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his version of what happened versus </v>

3462
02:30:45.891 --> 02:30:50.060
<v Speaker 1>her version would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know who's telling the truth.</v>

3463
02:30:50.540 --> 02:30:52.280
<v Speaker 1>You just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

3464
02:30:52.430 --> 02:30:53.263
<v Speaker 1>when things get so outrageous that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling stone thing gets published and </v>

3465
02:30:58.941 --> 02:31:03.290
<v Speaker 1>gets treated with kid gloves and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important magazines in American</v>

3466
02:31:03.291 --> 02:31:04.220
<v Speaker 1>crusher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3467
02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:05.233
<v Speaker 1>treats this as if it's a real story and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out to be a complete </v>

3468
02:31:07.251 --> 02:31:10.550
<v Speaker 1>fabrication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of in some ways highlights the</v>

3469
02:31:10.551 --> 02:31:14.690
<v Speaker 1>problems with dealing with this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff in a non objective way.</v>

3470
02:31:15.350 --> 02:31:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Carol tavers wrote a nice piece for us </v>
<v Speaker 1>and skeptic on,</v>

3471
02:31:18.380 --> 02:31:19.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you,</v>

3472
02:31:19.050 --> 02:31:20.040
<v Speaker 1>what we mean when we</v>

3473
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:24.180
<v Speaker 2>talk about rape and it gets his </v>
<v Speaker 2>categorical binary thinking.</v>

3474
02:31:24.181 --> 02:31:28.590
<v Speaker 2>So there's perfect behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else is rape.</v>

3475
02:31:29.490 --> 02:31:30.930
<v Speaker 2>And so she talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3476
02:31:30.931 --> 02:31:34.320
<v Speaker 2>the dance of seduction and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy's pressing and you know,</v>

3477
02:31:34.321 --> 02:31:36.930
<v Speaker 2>she's saying no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he says,</v>

3478
02:31:36.931 --> 02:31:39.300
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then she kind of hints that maybe okay,</v>

3479
02:31:39.301 --> 02:31:41.220
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you just sort of,</v>

3480
02:31:41.250 --> 02:31:42.083
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole foreplay process is kind of a </v>

3481
02:31:44.671 --> 02:31:48.360
<v Speaker 2>way of ending up over here and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

3482
02:31:48.361 --> 02:31:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Whenever she says no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's it.</v>

3483
02:31:50.071 --> 02:31:51.780
<v Speaker 2>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't like,</v>

3484
02:31:52.110 --> 02:31:53.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said no,</v>

3485
02:31:53.401 --> 02:31:54.234
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were still at the restaurant </v>

3486
02:31:55.111 --> 02:31:55.944
<v Speaker 2>and he just raped her anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually if there's a whole series of </v>

3487
02:31:58.591 --> 02:32:02.790
<v Speaker 2>steps that we never get to see or no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows we weren't there,</v>

3488
02:32:02.791 --> 02:32:06.150
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what happened and what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gray area was.</v>

3489
02:32:06.151 --> 02:32:09.480
<v Speaker 2>And when she says no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no for now,</v>

3490
02:32:09.481 --> 02:32:12.630
<v Speaker 2>maybe later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And none of that gets recorded.</v>

3491
02:32:12.631 --> 02:32:14.550
<v Speaker 2>So we have no idea of what happened.</v>

3492
02:32:14.850 --> 02:32:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also have to consider the,</v>

3493
02:32:16.411 --> 02:32:19.360
<v Speaker 1>like we've been talking about with so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many different other examples that there</v>

3494
02:32:19.361 --> 02:32:21.510
<v Speaker 1>is a giant spectrum of people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

3495
02:32:21.870 --> 02:32:22.703
<v Speaker 1>There are men that I know that liked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get bossed around by women and smacked </v>

3496
02:32:27.241 --> 02:32:29.760
<v Speaker 1>around and they like them to do terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to them.</v>

3497
02:32:29.761 --> 02:32:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And they will pay these women to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

3498
02:32:31.651 --> 02:32:35.760
<v Speaker 1>They'll go to a dominatrix or this woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>will insult them and hit them.</v>

3499
02:32:36.100 --> 02:32:36.933
<v Speaker 1>She beats them and paddles them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do all kinds of crazy stuff to </v>

3500
02:32:39.451 --> 02:32:40.284
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of these guys were like </v>

3501
02:32:40.591 --> 02:32:42.810
<v Speaker 1>wealthy guys who have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3502
02:32:42.840 --> 02:32:45.690
<v Speaker 1>they have like high pressure careers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met,</v>

3503
02:32:45.691 --> 02:32:48.960
<v Speaker 1>these guys have talked to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've know guys that have had this thing,</v>

3504
02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:50.453
<v Speaker 1>but if it's the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a woman that likes getting </v>

3505
02:32:52.591 --> 02:32:55.270
<v Speaker 1>smacked around by a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it becomes a crutch.</v>

3506
02:32:55.320 --> 02:32:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't even want to know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that girl is,</v>

3507
02:32:57.291 --> 02:32:58.650
<v Speaker 1>it exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3508
02:32:58.680 --> 02:32:59.311
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3509
02:32:59.311 --> 02:33:04.050
<v Speaker 1>a woman can't hire a male dominate years</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kick her ass and raper.</v>

3510
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:07.590
<v Speaker 1>But a man can hire a woman to humiliate </v>
<v Speaker 1>or Piss on her.</v>

3511
02:33:07.800 --> 02:33:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Like I know this guy likes girls to piss</v>
<v Speaker 1>on him.</v>

3512
02:33:09.870 --> 02:33:11.640
<v Speaker 1>He's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim Norton,</v>

3513
02:33:11.850 --> 02:33:15.060
<v Speaker 1>he's a wild man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he talks about it openly.</v>

3514
02:33:15.061 --> 02:33:18.210
<v Speaker 1>He's a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not the high,</v>

3515
02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:20.270
<v Speaker 1>high pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3516
02:33:20.280 --> 02:33:23.010
<v Speaker 1>executive type ties are doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just a nut and a pervert.</v>

3517
02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:24.780
<v Speaker 1>But hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious comedian.</v>

3518
02:33:25.500 --> 02:33:26.940
<v Speaker 1>But it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3519
02:33:26.941 --> 02:33:28.510
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't like it and beat up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

3520
02:33:28.770 --> 02:33:30.150
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can,</v>

3521
02:33:30.180 --> 02:33:31.013
<v Speaker 1>you can be a man and you can hire some </v>
<v Speaker 1>women to kick your ass and you could </v>

3522
02:33:33.451 --> 02:33:35.520
<v Speaker 1>have this desire to have this happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3523
02:33:35.790 --> 02:33:36.623
<v Speaker 1>but we're supposed to pretend that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not some women out there who </v>

3524
02:33:39.871 --> 02:33:40.704
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to like engage in a similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>type of activity with a man and they </v>

3525
02:33:45.751 --> 02:33:46.710
<v Speaker 1>must exist.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They just do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just do,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They must and if is it the same if you </v>

3528
02:33:53.371 --> 02:33:58.371
<v Speaker 1>decide that you and you're the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have sex with,</v>

<v Speaker 1>if you guys decide that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the way you do things,</v>

3530
02:34:02.310 --> 02:34:03.143
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you decide that she likes to smack you </v>

3531
02:34:04.741 --> 02:34:05.574
<v Speaker 1>around and she likes to get on top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you get off on it and she tells </v>

3532
02:34:09.361 --> 02:34:10.770
<v Speaker 1>you when you're going to have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>play that is completely fine.</v>

3536
02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:18.610

<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because it's not,</v>

3540
02:34:25.541 --> 02:34:27.500
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking grape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're knocking down.</v>

3541
02:34:27.501 --> 02:34:29.560
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking being prorate in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

3542
02:34:29.561 --> 02:34:30.394
<v Speaker 3>shape or form or pro domestic violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about people like Weird </v>

3543
02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:34.990
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3544
02:34:34.990 --> 02:34:38.470
<v Speaker 3>And some people actually want you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>commit crimes to them.</v>

3545
02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:41.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine a scenario in which that was all</v>

3546
02:34:41.801 --> 02:34:42.634
<v Speaker 3>consensual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then six months later he published </v>

3547
02:34:45.311 --> 02:34:47.880
<v Speaker 3>his story in rolling stone saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never consented.</v>

3548
02:34:47.930 --> 02:34:48.920
<v Speaker 3>She beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3549
02:34:49.090 --> 02:34:51.070
<v Speaker 3>Reverse those roles it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3550
02:34:51.130 --> 02:34:51.963
<v Speaker 3>It sounds terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't know what all the steps </v>

3551
02:34:53.831 --> 02:34:56.310
<v Speaker 3>where there's a great little short film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like fun.</v>

3552
02:34:56.320 --> 02:34:57.820
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like rape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apology talk though.</v>

3553
02:34:57.821 --> 02:35:00.940
<v Speaker 3>You know that Rhino,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even discussing this,</v>

3554
02:35:00.970 --> 02:35:02.600
<v Speaker 3>you become a rape apologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3555
02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:03.850
<v Speaker 3>So we should like be really clear.</v>

3556
02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:04.713
<v Speaker 3>That's not what I am doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at all the possibilities of </v>

3557
02:35:08.111 --> 02:35:11.830
<v Speaker 3>human behavior and I'm saying people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking weird.</v>

3558
02:35:11.950 --> 02:35:13.270
<v Speaker 3>We're weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3559
02:35:13.271 --> 02:35:14.560
<v Speaker 3>And our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our ideals,</v>

3560
02:35:14.561 --> 02:35:15.394
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times they're shaped by popular</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture and they're shaped by songs and </v>

3561
02:35:18.701 --> 02:35:19.534
<v Speaker 3>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those in some ways dictate more of </v>

3562
02:35:22.181 --> 02:35:25.600
<v Speaker 3>what we expect from our life than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual lives we see around us.</v>

3563
02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>As each people are fucking strange.</v>

3564
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:30.790
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>

3565
02:35:30.791 --> 02:35:33.760
<v Speaker 3>this new law in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have verbal consents.</v>

3566
02:35:33.790 --> 02:35:35.770
<v Speaker 3>How do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you record it?</v>

3567
02:35:36.430 --> 02:35:37.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still,</v>

3568
02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:38.560
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>

3569
02:35:38.561 --> 02:35:39.880
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked her verbally,</v>

3570
02:35:39.881 --> 02:35:41.920
<v Speaker 3>she said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she says,</v>

3571
02:35:41.921 --> 02:35:43.690
<v Speaker 3>I never said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we know?</v>

3572
02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:44.553
<v Speaker 3>Did you see the video that got released </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this really wealthy billionaire </v>

3573
02:35:46.691 --> 02:35:50.710
<v Speaker 3>character in Florida filmed his </v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend beating herself up?</v>

3574
02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:55.120
<v Speaker 3>She's on the bed and he put in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>security camera because,</v>

3575
02:35:55.480 --> 02:35:56.313
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he just knew she was gonna do </v>

3576
02:35:57.671 --> 02:35:58.630
<v Speaker 3>something crazy like this.</v>

3577
02:35:58.630 --> 02:36:00.720
<v Speaker 3>So he's breaking up with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3578
02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:02.080
<v Speaker 3>she told the police,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he beat her up.</v>

3579
02:36:02.250 --> 02:36:05.530
<v Speaker 3>She's on the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whaling herself in the face,</v>

3580
02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:06.753
<v Speaker 3>and there's video this screaming at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>top of her lungs were weighing yourself </v>

3581
02:36:09.131 --> 02:36:09.964
<v Speaker 3>into a frenzy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably with the windows open so the </v>

3582
02:36:11.591 --> 02:36:12.424
<v Speaker 3>neighbors can hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's just beating the shit out of </v>

3583
02:36:14.531 --> 02:36:15.580
<v Speaker 3>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does,</v>

3584
02:36:15.581 --> 02:36:17.650
<v Speaker 3>he didn't have video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be screwed.</v>

3585
02:36:17.710 --> 02:36:18.770
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3586
02:36:18.771 --> 02:36:20.860
<v Speaker 3>And many people have been for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3587
02:36:20.861 --> 02:36:21.790
<v Speaker 3>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3588
02:36:21.791 --> 02:36:24.670
<v Speaker 3>this is not being a domestic violence </v>
<v Speaker 3>apologist.</v>

3589
02:36:24.671 --> 02:36:26.950
<v Speaker 3>This is not saying that men don't beat </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

3590
02:36:27.170 --> 02:36:30.340
<v Speaker 3>It's just saying when we look at things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

3591
02:36:30.341 --> 02:36:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm a man so I side with all men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I'm a woman.</v>

3592
02:36:32.711 --> 02:36:35.710
<v Speaker 3>So the women must be telling the truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're just people.</v>

3593
02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:39.280
<v Speaker 3>There's awesome people that are men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's awesome people that are women.</v>

3594
02:36:39.430 --> 02:36:42.650
<v Speaker 3>There's awesome people that are asexual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just does a really good,</v>

3595
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:46.240
<v Speaker 3>a really good little film short online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the producer.</v>

3596
02:36:46.241 --> 02:36:47.051
<v Speaker 3>It might've been right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3597
02:36:47.051 --> 02:36:49.460
<v Speaker 3>Is there a reitman producer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3598
02:36:49.480 --> 02:36:50.370
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ivan Reitman is,</v>

3599
02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:52.200
<v Speaker 3>maybe that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

3600
02:36:52.210 --> 02:36:53.043
<v Speaker 3>it's a young couple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in a dorm room and they're on the </v>

3601
02:36:54.911 --> 02:36:55.744
<v Speaker 3>bed clothes on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're making out in foreplay and at </v>

3602
02:36:58.151 --> 02:36:59.440
<v Speaker 3>some point he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3603
02:36:59.441 --> 02:37:00.970
<v Speaker 3>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I better get the,</v>

3604
02:37:00.971 --> 02:37:02.410
<v Speaker 3>you know the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>

3605
02:37:02.411 --> 02:37:02.771
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3606
02:37:02.771 --> 02:37:03.604
<v Speaker 3>I think you should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're thinking he's going to reach </v>

3607
02:37:04.571 --> 02:37:05.404
<v Speaker 3>for a condom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he pulls a contract out and he's </v>

3608
02:37:07.481 --> 02:37:08.081
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

3609
02:37:08.081 --> 02:37:08.920
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he,</v>

3610
02:37:08.921 --> 02:37:11.800
<v Speaker 3>and then his lawyer comes in and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>her lawyer has it and they're like,</v>

3611
02:37:11.801 --> 02:37:12.634
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my client would like to touch your </v>

3612
02:37:14.051 --> 02:37:17.480
<v Speaker 3>client on the breasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now will your client agreed to this?</v>

3613
02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:18.313
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he checked this and the whole thing </v>

3614
02:37:19.611 --> 02:37:21.080
<v Speaker 3>goes through that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3615
02:37:21.100 --> 02:37:23.150
<v Speaker 3>It's called consents made by his son </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jason Reitman.</v>

3616
02:37:23.210 --> 02:37:24.043
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

3617
02:37:24.140 --> 02:37:24.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there we go.</v>

3618
02:37:24.890 --> 02:37:25.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a hilarious one that was a pro </v>

3619
02:37:27.951 --> 02:37:32.951
<v Speaker 3>consent video that they had released,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to get people acclimated with this</v>

3620
02:37:33.291 --> 02:37:34.124
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a attractive young couple like </v>

3621
02:37:36.111 --> 02:37:39.930
<v Speaker 3>hipster looking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had like a funky mustache and his,</v>

3622
02:37:39.931 --> 02:37:42.500
<v Speaker 3>he's with a girl and they're making out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

3623
02:37:42.501 --> 02:37:43.820
<v Speaker 3>can I touch your leg?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

3624
02:37:43.821 --> 02:37:45.170
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3625
02:37:45.171 --> 02:37:46.700
<v Speaker 3>and then she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I touch your leg?</v>

3626
02:37:46.701 --> 02:37:47.534
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

3627
02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:48.650
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I kiss you?</v>

3628
02:37:48.651 --> 02:37:49.490
<v Speaker 3>And she says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

3629
02:37:49.790 --> 02:37:50.870
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I take your shirt off?</v>

3630
02:37:50.871 --> 02:37:51.704
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not yet.</v>

3631
02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:53.900
<v Speaker 3>And they keep making out and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda hot.</v>

3632
02:37:54.350 --> 02:37:55.550
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3633
02:37:55.551 --> 02:37:58.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you should fucking have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that all the time.</v>

3634
02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:00.650
<v Speaker 3>And especially if you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with someone,</v>

3635
02:38:00.651 --> 02:38:01.484
<v Speaker 3>then it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I could understand like the first </v>

3636
02:38:02.691 --> 02:38:04.700
<v Speaker 3>couple of times you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the video,</v>

3637
02:38:04.701 --> 02:38:07.340
<v Speaker 3>like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't support that being a rule.</v>

3638
02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:09.620
<v Speaker 3>But if two people want to do that on </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own,</v>

3639
02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.530
<v Speaker 3>that video is kind of hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it looks like wow.</v>

3640
02:38:12.531 --> 02:38:14.690
<v Speaker 3>Eventually she said no and then she said</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

3641
02:38:14.691 --> 02:38:16.880
<v Speaker 3>the shirt came off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're making progress.</v>

3642
02:38:16.940 --> 02:38:18.560
<v Speaker 3>Some things are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

3643
02:38:18.650 --> 02:38:21.110
<v Speaker 3>she's obviously enjoying this makeout </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3644
02:38:21.111 --> 02:38:21.944
<v Speaker 3>Like it's Kinda hot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you shouldn't fucking have to do </v>

3645
02:38:25.011 --> 02:38:26.600
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people have never done that.</v>

3646
02:38:26.601 --> 02:38:30.410
<v Speaker 3>And this idea that you make it a law and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you got to enforce it.</v>

3647
02:38:30.411 --> 02:38:31.244
<v Speaker 3>How do you enforce the law?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not going to work with </v>

3648
02:38:32.781 --> 02:38:34.760
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people don't want to say Shit,</v>

3649
02:38:35.090 --> 02:38:36.500
<v Speaker 3>some women don't want to talk about it.</v>

3650
02:38:36.500 --> 02:38:38.900
<v Speaker 3>Some men don't want to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some people want to talk about every</v>

3651
02:38:38.901 --> 02:38:40.070
<v Speaker 3>single aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3652
02:38:40.250 --> 02:38:42.830
<v Speaker 3>Find someone who meshes with what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3653
02:38:42.831 --> 02:38:43.664
<v Speaker 3>he gave an interview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it might've been enrolling </v>

3654
02:38:44.730 --> 02:38:45.111
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3655
02:38:45.111 --> 02:38:45.944
<v Speaker 3>it might've been in the Atlantic where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it Kinda college coed and the guy just </v>

3656
02:38:49.521 --> 02:38:51.070
<v Speaker 3>kept asking her an African,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did that.</v>

3657
02:38:51.071 --> 02:38:53.090
<v Speaker 3>She said shut the fuck up and just fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

3658
02:38:53.930 --> 02:38:56.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>

3659
02:38:56.570 --> 02:38:59.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's okay too.</v>

3660
02:38:59.470 --> 02:39:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like everything's okay,</v>

3661
02:39:02.090 --> 02:39:02.923
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as you start telling people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to ask every question in the </v>

3662
02:39:05.751 --> 02:39:08.510
<v Speaker 3>book before you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No you don't.</v>

3663
02:39:08.540 --> 02:39:09.530
<v Speaker 3>No you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3664
02:39:09.531 --> 02:39:10.980
<v Speaker 3>you just don't rape people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3665
02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:12.830
<v Speaker 3>Just don't rate people and then we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>all good.</v>

3666
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:13.820
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real simple.</v>

3667
02:39:13.821 --> 02:39:15.800
<v Speaker 3>Don't hold anybody down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't make them do things.</v>

3668
02:39:15.801 --> 02:39:17.850
<v Speaker 3>Don't fuck them when they're passed out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are done.</v>

3669
02:39:18.750 --> 02:39:20.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

3670
02:39:20.631 --> 02:39:23.270
<v Speaker 3>it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets a little silly,</v>

3671
02:39:24.140 --> 02:39:24.973
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the intention behind it is like you're </v>

3672
02:39:26.451 --> 02:39:27.284
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the intention behind it ultimately is </v>

3673
02:39:29.211 --> 02:39:30.044
<v Speaker 3>about progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately is about making an </v>

3674
02:39:31.881 --> 02:39:34.760
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's ill intentioned or not,</v>

3675
02:39:34.761 --> 02:39:37.760
<v Speaker 3>or whether it's like ill thought out or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

3676
02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:39.950
<v Speaker 3>The idea is to create a safer </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

3677
02:39:40.130 --> 02:39:40.963
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you doing that or are you just </v>

3678
02:39:42.381 --> 02:39:43.214
<v Speaker 3>annoying the fuck out of people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the same amount of sexual assault </v>

3679
02:39:45.380 --> 02:39:46.790
<v Speaker 3>was going to go on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3680
02:39:47.060 --> 02:39:47.893
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting question because if </v>

3681
02:39:48.891 --> 02:39:49.724
<v Speaker 3>you pull so far left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they meet in a different place then </v>

3682
02:39:52.251 --> 02:39:53.084
<v Speaker 3>they would be if he just let them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well boys will be boys stay away from </v>

3683
02:39:55.821 --> 02:39:58.610
<v Speaker 3>the fraternity ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3684
02:39:58.660 --> 02:39:59.493
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't fly anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe it does in some way help and </v>

3685
02:40:02.181 --> 02:40:02.780
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3686
02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:03.613
<v Speaker 3>we set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we put up with the number of diversity </v>

3687
02:40:05.271 --> 02:40:05.870
<v Speaker 3>officers.</v>

3688
02:40:05.870 --> 02:40:06.703
<v Speaker 3>I mean the moment you hire somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>whose job it is to basically look for </v>

3689
02:40:10.371 --> 02:40:13.530
<v Speaker 3>diversity anytime it doesn't meet what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3690
02:40:13.531 --> 02:40:15.570
<v Speaker 3>whatever the criteria is at that moment </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3691
02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:16.590
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a problem.</v>

3692
02:40:16.730 --> 02:40:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3693
02:40:17.490 --> 02:40:19.590
<v Speaker 3>Did we really have a problem?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a little bit,</v>

3694
02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:22.260
<v Speaker 3>but now it's a big official problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta write it up.</v>

3695
02:40:22.290 --> 02:40:24.100
<v Speaker 3>We got to make it a law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3696
02:40:24.460 --> 02:40:26.130
<v Speaker 3>betty work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3697
02:40:26.131 --> 02:40:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Busy work looking and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for trouble.</v>

3698
02:40:29.170 --> 02:40:31.420
<v Speaker 3>Like unions had been doing that since </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning of time.</v>

3699
02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:34.110
<v Speaker 3>That's teachers' unions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's like a,</v>

3700
02:40:34.111 --> 02:40:34.944
<v Speaker 3>that's a big issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been creating jobs since the </v>

3701
02:40:37.111 --> 02:40:38.880
<v Speaker 3>beginning of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was always like that.</v>

3702
02:40:39.020 --> 02:40:42.840
<v Speaker 3>I had a buddy of mine who had a job on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3703
02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:44.510
<v Speaker 3>what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they do the big g,</v>

3704
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:45.510
<v Speaker 3>the javits center,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3705
02:40:45.511 --> 02:40:46.410
<v Speaker 3>the javits center in New York.</v>

3706
02:40:46.710 --> 02:40:48.780
<v Speaker 3>He had a job where he doesn't even go </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3707
02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:52.050
<v Speaker 3>He got a check every week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't even go there.</v>

3708
02:40:52.051 --> 02:40:55.590
<v Speaker 3>He never went there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was one of those no show jobs.</v>

3709
02:40:55.670 --> 02:40:56.503
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like some union deal that they had </v>

3710
02:40:58.321 --> 02:41:02.420
<v Speaker 3>made probably with quote unquote </v>
<v Speaker 3>organized crime and this,</v>

3711
02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:04.890
<v Speaker 3>so all that stuff's always been fluffed </v>
<v Speaker 3>up forever.</v>

3712
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:07.350
<v Speaker 3>So this idea of having all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity officers,</v>

3713
02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:10.220
<v Speaker 3>they're going to fucking create conflict</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to keep their job afloat.</v>

3714
02:41:10.410 --> 02:41:12.870
<v Speaker 3>The last thing they want is them to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsolete.</v>

3715
02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:14.101
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll look,</v>

3716
02:41:14.101 --> 02:41:16.650
<v Speaker 3>we all just decided like taco Tuesday's </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

3717
02:41:16.651 --> 02:41:18.660
<v Speaker 3>I like Tacos and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3718
02:41:18.661 --> 02:41:21.600
<v Speaker 3>you can dress like an Indian if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really love native Americans.</v>

3719
02:41:21.780 --> 02:41:23.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you really have a respect for it?</v>

3720
02:41:23.041 --> 02:41:24.450
<v Speaker 3>And you're not like being an asshole </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

3721
02:41:24.460 --> 02:41:24.931
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3722
02:41:24.931 --> 02:41:26.370
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The black face,</v>

3723
02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:27.360
<v Speaker 3>we're going to leave that alone.</v>

3724
02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:28.940
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to go with black face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

3725
02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.650
<v Speaker 3>that's why the only way the rule is </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't be a deck.</v>

3726
02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:32.823
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and most people know when they're being </v>

3727
02:41:34.231 --> 02:41:36.900
<v Speaker 3>a dick and if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then then your,</v>

3728
02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:38.760
<v Speaker 3>your colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend should tell you,</v>

3729
02:41:38.820 --> 02:41:40.200
<v Speaker 3>but can you be a dick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And be funny,</v>

3730
02:41:40.530 --> 02:41:41.700
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3731
02:41:41.730 --> 02:41:43.470
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can as a comedian,</v>

3732
02:41:43.471 --> 02:41:45.120
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if a white guy,</v>

3733
02:41:45.150 --> 02:41:48.140
<v Speaker 3>like what if a black guy dresses like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>white guy,</v>

3734
02:41:48.180 --> 02:41:51.990
<v Speaker 3>puts white face on and just starts doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most ridiculous white stereotype?</v>

3735
02:41:52.620 --> 02:41:53.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when,</v>

3736
02:41:53.470 --> 02:41:54.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3737
02:41:55.110 --> 02:41:59.250
<v Speaker 3>ted Danson came was on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it the Oscars or the analyzer with a</v>

3738
02:41:59.251 --> 02:42:00.860
<v Speaker 3>penalty?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had any host or something.</v>

3739
02:42:00.870 --> 02:42:01.703
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was dating her at the time and he </v>

3740
02:42:03.511 --> 02:42:04.344
<v Speaker 3>made a little joke about we'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>chamberlains record and he showed up a </v>

3741
02:42:08.341 --> 02:42:09.450
<v Speaker 3>leg face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that?</v>

3742
02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:10.230
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3743
02:42:10.230 --> 02:42:11.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got,</v>

3744
02:42:11.220 --> 02:42:12.330
<v Speaker 3>that was a big controversy.</v>

3745
02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

3746
02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:15.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this point,</v>

3747
02:42:15.031 --> 02:42:18.150
<v Speaker 3>whenever that place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a bronze,</v>

3748
02:42:18.151 --> 02:42:19.230
<v Speaker 3>1980s,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3749
02:42:19.231 --> 02:42:20.064
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is hilarious that he did that no </v>

3750
02:42:21.511 --> 02:42:22.700
<v Speaker 3>longer funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3751
02:42:22.860 --> 02:42:23.693
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that crazy though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That this is one specific look with </v>

3752
02:42:26.821 --> 02:42:28.920
<v Speaker 3>makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do not allow,</v>

3753
02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:33.300
<v Speaker 3>you cannot pretend to be a white person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are,</v>

3754
02:42:33.301 --> 02:42:35.430
<v Speaker 3>you cannot be a white person who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretending to be a black person,</v>

3755
02:42:35.431 --> 02:42:39.330
<v Speaker 3>but you can pretend to be anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3756
02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:40.583
<v Speaker 3>Like a white man can pretend there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably good reasons for that in </v>

3757
02:42:42.811 --> 02:42:43.830
<v Speaker 3>our history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3758
02:42:43.831 --> 02:42:45.090
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3759
02:42:45.180 --> 02:42:47.820
<v Speaker 3>who played Charlie Chan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a white guy,</v>

3760
02:42:47.970 --> 02:42:48.803
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The famous Chinese detective that was a </v>

3761
02:42:51.121 --> 02:42:52.800
<v Speaker 3>white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>

3762
02:42:52.980 --> 02:42:53.813
<v Speaker 3>when John Wayne played gingiss con and </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember that it didn't Tom Cruise play </v>

3763
02:42:57.451 --> 02:43:00.090
<v Speaker 3>an Asian and one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the last Samurai,</v>

3764
02:43:00.091 --> 02:43:00.960
<v Speaker 3>but he was a Europe.</v>

3765
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:03.120
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3766
02:43:03.630 --> 02:43:04.950
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3767
02:43:04.951 --> 02:43:05.560
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3768
02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:07.080
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 3>throw it like it's basketball.</v>

3889
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:48.080

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4001
02:52:20.560 --> 02:52:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was doing like,</v>

4002
02:52:22.810 --> 02:52:25.660
<v Speaker 3>maybe this was her start and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was just,</v>

4003
02:52:25.930 --> 02:52:27.280
<v Speaker 3>she's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met her.</v>

4004
02:52:27.340 --> 02:52:28.250
<v Speaker 3>She's a nice person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4005
02:52:28.360 --> 02:52:30.300
<v Speaker 3>She's just desperate for money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4006
02:52:33.070 --> 02:52:35.110
<v Speaker 3>Like an ice skater there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4007
02:52:35.111 --> 02:52:36.450
<v Speaker 3>She's thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4008
02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:37.790
<v Speaker 3>she must have been a good athlete to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4009
02:52:37.800 --> 02:52:39.490
<v Speaker 3>you can't be an Olympic ice skater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4010
02:52:39.491 --> 02:52:40.710
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good athlete.</v>

4011
02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:41.793
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was a weird view into </v>

4012
02:52:43.721 --> 02:52:44.560
<v Speaker 3>athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4013
02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:48.180
<v Speaker 3>When a Nancy Kerrigan is got beaten up </v>
<v Speaker 3>by that,</v>

4014
02:52:48.181 --> 02:52:49.450
<v Speaker 3>he hit her in the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4015
02:52:49.451 --> 02:52:51.460
<v Speaker 3>Like hit her in the leg with a stick or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

4016
02:52:51.461 --> 02:52:53.670
<v Speaker 3>So guy like a tire iron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it a tyrant?</v>

4017
02:52:54.130 --> 02:52:54.770
<v Speaker 3>He bashed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

4018
02:52:54.770 --> 02:52:57.580
<v Speaker 3>I think he shattered her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not The kneecap,</v>

4019
02:52:57.740 --> 02:53:00.280
<v Speaker 3>but right next to it or part of it or </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct it or something.</v>

4020
02:53:00.281 --> 02:53:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty heavy.</v>

4021
02:53:01.690 --> 02:53:03.580
<v Speaker 3>I thought she was able to command it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

4022
02:53:03.610 --> 02:53:07.640
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Tonya harding boyfriend </v>
<v Speaker 3>had hired the guy,</v>

4023
02:53:07.641 --> 02:53:09.420
<v Speaker 3>so she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was indirectly involved.</v>

4024
02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4025
02:53:11.260 --> 02:53:12.093
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4026
02:53:12.340 --> 02:53:14.380
<v Speaker 3>they were planning on Tonya harding </v>
<v Speaker 3>winning the Olympics.</v>

4027
02:53:14.380 --> 02:53:15.213
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted her to,</v>

4028
02:53:16.690 --> 02:53:18.120
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was her and um,</v>

4029
02:53:18.180 --> 02:53:19.660
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nancy Kerrigan,</v>

4030
02:53:19.661 --> 02:53:23.920
<v Speaker 3>they were the golden middle toe to </v>
<v Speaker 3>compete competition for the gold medal.</v>

4031
02:53:24.100 --> 02:53:24.933
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the extent of the </v>

4032
02:53:25.721 --> 02:53:26.554
<v Speaker 3>injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember Nancy Kerrigan was screaming </v>

4033
02:53:28.031 --> 02:53:29.770
<v Speaker 3>and she was holding like there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>video of it,</v>

4034
02:53:29.800 --> 02:53:30.633
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4035
02:53:30.960 --> 02:53:32.890
<v Speaker 3>Which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she came back.</v>

4036
02:53:33.370 --> 02:53:36.370
<v Speaker 3>There's a video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was there a video of the guy doing it?</v>

4037
02:53:37.390 --> 02:53:38.223
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's got this aftermath </v>

4038
02:53:39.251 --> 02:53:40.270
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's screaming.</v>

4039
02:53:40.870 --> 02:53:42.460
<v Speaker 3>She ended up competing in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympics.</v>

4040
02:53:42.461 --> 02:53:47.020
<v Speaker 3>I think that is so crazy that someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>could do that.</v>

4041
02:53:47.021 --> 02:53:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Just run up to this girl and smash or </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a tire iron.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

4043
02:53:52.060 --> 02:53:54.190
<v Speaker 3>What he was trying to think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fuck.</v>

4044
02:53:54.191 --> 02:53:55.024
<v Speaker 3>That is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy that someone could do </v>

4045
02:53:57.851 --> 02:53:58.684
<v Speaker 3>that because of an ice skating </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition that instead of competing </v>

4046
02:54:01.601 --> 02:54:03.310
<v Speaker 3>and trying to win and trying to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best,</v>

<v Speaker 3>so it was one of those buttons that they</v>

4050
02:54:09.941 --> 02:54:12.730

<v Speaker 3>her ex husband,</v>

4051
02:54:14.140 --> 02:54:17.380
<v Speaker 3>Shane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stan had been hired by her ex touching.</v>

4052
02:54:17.930 --> 02:54:18.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what,</v>

4053
02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:20.950
<v Speaker 3>that's what Michael said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

4054
02:54:22.090 --> 02:54:22.923
<v Speaker 3>Tell us those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was never convicted of being </v>

4055
02:54:26.260 --> 02:54:29.010
<v Speaker 3>associated with it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just indirectly anyway.</v>

4056
02:54:29.530 --> 02:54:30.011
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what words were said right,</v>

4058
02:54:32.360 --> 02:54:36.370
<v Speaker 3>but crazy that someone would do that for</v>
<v Speaker 3>an ice skating competition.</v>

4059
02:54:37.230 --> 02:54:41.030
<v Speaker 3>You smashed some girl's leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it's,</v>

4060
02:54:41.360 --> 02:54:44.470
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't there a Texas cheerleader mom that</v>

02:54:49.271 --> 02:54:51.250
<v Speaker 3>cheerleader that where there was even a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few years ago,</v>

4063
02:54:52.450 --> 02:54:55.930
<v Speaker 3>maybe even killed her or just attacked </v>
<v Speaker 3>her brutally or something like that.</v>

4064
02:54:56.470 --> 02:54:57.570
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4067
02:54:59.710 --> 02:55:00.543
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

4068
02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a lifetime movie story kind of</v>

4069
02:55:02.411 --> 02:55:02.680
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

4070
02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:03.513
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4071
02:55:03.620 --> 02:55:05.000
<v Speaker 3>but it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's based on real sure.</v>

4072
02:55:05.001 --> 02:55:05.834
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They add a few things to those based on </v>

4073
02:55:07.311 --> 02:55:08.144
<v Speaker 3>rails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was devastated when I found out the </v>

4074
02:55:09.561 --> 02:55:11.540
<v Speaker 3>revenant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The revenant wasn't real.</v>

4075
02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:12.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

4076
02:55:12.170 --> 02:55:13.003
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only was it not real and apparently </v>

4077
02:55:14.241 --> 02:55:17.180
<v Speaker 3>they don't even say it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everybody says it's real everybody.</v>

4078
02:55:17.181 --> 02:55:18.014
<v Speaker 3>Cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had heard the story before for my </v>

4079
02:55:19.401 --> 02:55:21.180
<v Speaker 3>friend Steve Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was a,</v>

4080
02:55:21.181 --> 02:55:22.014
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's really kind of a historian on the </v>

4081
02:55:23.721 --> 02:55:24.554
<v Speaker 3>wild west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get some great stories about the </v>

4082
02:55:25.941 --> 02:55:28.130
<v Speaker 3>conflicts that she need of Americans and</v>
<v Speaker 3>settlers.</v>

4083
02:55:28.131 --> 02:55:30.110
<v Speaker 3>He knows all about the pioneers of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain men.</v>

4084
02:55:30.350 --> 02:55:31.880
<v Speaker 3>He said that that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

4085
02:55:31.910 --> 02:55:35.030
<v Speaker 3>the guy in that Leonardo Dicaprio played</v>
<v Speaker 3>never had a son.</v>

4086
02:55:35.180 --> 02:55:36.013
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the main motivations of </v>
<v Speaker 3>him going after this guy that got </v>

4087
02:55:38.271 --> 02:55:39.830
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His son didn't have a son.</v>

4088
02:55:40.220 --> 02:55:41.053
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing that was true was he got </v>

4089
02:55:42.231 --> 02:55:45.800
<v Speaker 3>attacked by a bear and they left him to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dad and he survived.</v>

4090
02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:48.830
<v Speaker 3>But he didn't kill anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there really were killing people and</v>

4091
02:55:48.831 --> 02:55:50.780
<v Speaker 3>survive in and the guy never killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>

4092
02:55:50.800 --> 02:55:51.633
<v Speaker 3>There really were a trappers and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>really were native Americans and they </v>

4093
02:55:54.411 --> 02:55:55.820
<v Speaker 3>really were bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4094
02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.820
<v Speaker 3>All those things existed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's so funny when you have a movie,</v>

4095
02:55:58.821 --> 02:55:59.654
<v Speaker 3>like then you put words in people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouths and you just decide what they </v>

4096
02:56:02.330 --> 02:56:03.163
<v Speaker 3>could've said that sounded cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they shouldn't be allowed to do </v>

4097
02:56:04.941 --> 02:56:06.140
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4098
02:56:07.220 --> 02:56:09.740
<v Speaker 3>based on means we're gonna make some </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit up.</v>

4099
02:56:09.830 --> 02:56:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could Kevin Costner,</v>

4100
02:56:11.721 --> 02:56:14.210
<v Speaker 3>you could do dances with wolves cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to fake character.</v>

4101
02:56:14.510 --> 02:56:16.010
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you did Wyatt earp,</v>

4102
02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:17.840
<v Speaker 3>you made a bunch of shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4103
02:56:17.870 --> 02:56:18.703
<v Speaker 3>He decided what Wyatt earp said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you know we don't have a </v>

4104
02:56:22.011 --> 02:56:22.580
<v Speaker 3>recording?</v>

4105
02:56:22.580 --> 02:56:24.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all historical.</v>

4106
02:56:24.081 --> 02:56:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Recreation's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange.</v>

4107
02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:28.193
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>

4108
02:56:28.760 --> 02:56:30.000

<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

4109
