<v Speaker 1>So I went out there and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>everyone was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's the first place they did the Grand </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ole opry.</v>

18
00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Hank Williams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

20
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

21

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

22
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the theater and you walk in,</v>

23
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh wait a minute.</v>

24
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.700
<v Speaker 1>This had just had that magic in it and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was went out and I had this great set </v>

25
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>and that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:49.850
<v Speaker 1>you just stick it in the card catalog </v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

27
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.260
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next time I have A.</v>

28
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just burned all this material so I got</v>

29
00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>to write a whole new hour and come back </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

30
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>And so next time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to shoot something.</v>

32
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.350
<v Speaker 1>I think there was about a month before I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did the Tabernacle for my one previous </v>

33
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.081
<v Speaker 1>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I already knew which was cool before </v>

34
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:07.081
<v Speaker 1>I wrote my next hour where I was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to shoot it.</v>

35
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>So are you on a two year schedule?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that that's the way to do it?</v>

36
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Roughly two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I have like a,</v>

37
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.140
<v Speaker 1>like a vibe of when like this one was </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcooked and just because I got real </v>

38
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>busy with F is for family.</v>

39
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I would have liked to have taped it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>about six months earlier,</v>

40
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.490
<v Speaker 1>but it made it a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it,</v>

41
00:01:24.491 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 1>it made it better or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would have just as far as,</v>

42
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.160
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

43
00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like in this business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that thing,</v>

44
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:37.581
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be overexposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you don't want to wait too </v>

45
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:37.870
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you got to try to.</v>

46
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>And then that's also not like a Oh so </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so successful and he waits x amount </v>

47
00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to do the exact thing.</v>

48
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>it's really like whatever you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

50
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:51.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's Kinda different for different </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

51
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:56.871
<v Speaker 1>Like those youtube stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like their thing is all about just </v>

52
00:01:56.871 --> 00:02:00.021
<v Speaker 1>constantly putting out stuff where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the road that I'm on is,</v>

53
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:05.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right now I'm out there promoting </v>

54
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>this shit and then once it comes out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's seeing it and they're liking</v>

55
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:12.711
<v Speaker 1>it and then I'm done promoting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I just sort of disappeared until F </v>

56
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:12.711
<v Speaker 1>is for family comes out.</v>

57
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of a big believer in that.</v>

58
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Have you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be out there when you got something </v>

59
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>that's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't just do shit to do shit.</v>

60
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I call that like extra TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

61
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:26.460
<v Speaker 1>he's just here to be here and now he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there.</v>

62
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:27.680
<v Speaker 1>There's that guy again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I,</v>

63
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>because I find myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that I'm fans of starting to hate</v>

64
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:36.111
<v Speaker 1>people going like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking get away from this fucking </v>

65
00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:36.111
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm thinking like,</v>

66
00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>do I actually hate this person or I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what it is,</v>

67
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 1>but there's definitely a tipping point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

68
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>It was real smart about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Tosh,</v>

69
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't do a fucking thing.</v>

70
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>He sells out everywhere he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got millions of dollars,</v>

71
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:48.060
<v Speaker 1>so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

72
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm overexposed as it is.</v>

73
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>My shows on constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing nothing.</v>

74
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Speaker 1>He won't do interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't do podcasts.</v>

75
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam Sandler's.</v>

76
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Another guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Adam Sandler doesn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

78
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last time I saw him promote a movie </v>

79
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>and yet I see all of his movies and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just hear through the Grapevine,</v>

80
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he signed some big thing with Netflix.</v>

81
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>All his movies are going to be over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

82
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

83
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm watching them over there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always just sort of like.</v>

84
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't until um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to somebody like,</v>

85
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't do any press good for his </v>

86
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

87
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.700
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from what I heard for he does very </v>

88
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.700
<v Speaker 1>little if he does any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

89
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's smart and he's got his core </v>

90
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.330
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

94
00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>It is fucking hilarious when you watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you watch a really silly movie with</v>

95
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:40.141
<v Speaker 1>a six year old and an eight year old and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're literally fallen off the couch </v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all those movies are stupid dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fucking think every time</v>

103
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I go see him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes they just want somebody to</v>

104
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>make me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked,</v>

107
00:03:59.581 --> 00:04:04.581
<v Speaker 1>When was coming up with hilarious dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was living with Bobby </v>

<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

110
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Like it was kind of like a Goto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111

<v Speaker 1>but that was,</v>

122
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>that was a funny one to know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he just doesn't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that made a zillion dollars.</v>

131
00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:54.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Avoid the press.</v>

132
00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Find your core audience to what you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

133
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like they're like,</v>

135
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.060
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's kind of the same </v>

136
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 1>amount of time that I do around a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half.</v>

137
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I started thinking this thing's about </v>
<v Speaker 1>don,</v>

138
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

139
00:05:07.971 --> 00:05:09.330
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like wow,</v>

140
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I could kind of pull it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not really.</v>

141
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 1>You're not smarter than you take it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the oven too soon.</v>

142
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Then there's just like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 1>was still a little mushy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just like,</v>

144
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

145
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go out there and you kick the shit </v>

146
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.570

<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>

147
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully they like it and then they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>come see you again on your next tour.</v>

149
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:34.630
<v Speaker 1>and that's all you owe them and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all they owe you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to go see you when you </v>

153
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.431
<v Speaker 1>can't ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't ask fans to do any more than </v>

154
00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:47.431
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

159
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to kind of try and keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

162
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 2>He said that at one point in time </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians used to have a.</v>

163
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:05.660
<v Speaker 2>They used to do a special and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the best special,</v>

164
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 2>like an hbo special and then they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>slide off.</v>

165
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 2>They would all slide off every one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

166
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 2>like kinnisons the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Kennison.</v>

167
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:16.440
<v Speaker 2>You watched kinisons first special and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you watch it,</v>

168
00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 2>like listen to louder than hell that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that cassette.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I understand because it's not 1986 </v>

171
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you were in 1986 and you saw that</v>

172
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 2>you would have been blown away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have been like in the presence</v>

173
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:32.430
<v Speaker 2>of greatness.</v>

<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

177
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 2>It got worse and worse and worse as far </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I could just.</v>

179
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:44.480

<v Speaker 2>fan,</v>

180
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.220
<v Speaker 2>he kind of seemed like he stepped in </v>
<v Speaker 2>every single pitfall of being,</v>

181
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>now I can watch it on a different level </v>

234
00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:34.791
<v Speaker 1>as far as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his technique is sick so he's not </v>

235
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:35.640
<v Speaker 1>fucking his arms up and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's moving his arms,</v>

236
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.410
<v Speaker 1>given people a show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it's,</v>

237
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to explain like,</v>

238
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

239
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:45.111
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a professional drummer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also hard to explain like over </v>

240
00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:45.111
<v Speaker 1>a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

241
00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:45.111
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

242
00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:45.111
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

243
00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 1>it's letting the stick do the work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he kind of equated it to like,</v>

244
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:50.640
<v Speaker 1>if you'd like dribbling a ball or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

245
00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:51.440
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it was somebody else.</v>

246
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.610
<v Speaker 1>If you dribble a basketball to every </v>
<v Speaker 1>time it comes up to your hand,</v>

247
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:58.611
<v Speaker 1>once you get it going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not slamming it back down to the </v>

248
00:09:58.611 --> 00:09:58.611
<v Speaker 1>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just controlling the rebound.</v>

249
00:09:58.611 --> 00:10:00.630
<v Speaker 1>It's something sorted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

250
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.900
<v Speaker 1>This is the one that if you play a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could turn up the volume.</v>

251
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just going to bore the shit out </v>

252
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:11.410
<v Speaker 1>of people with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

253
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:11.410
<v Speaker 1>no it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it as hands.</v>

254
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.410
<v Speaker 1>How loose his hands are seen when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>just opens his hand like that.</v>

255
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.650
<v Speaker 1>He's getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.550
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a fucking animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're fucking really deep into this </v>

259
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.080
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's literally a tried therapy.</v>

260
00:10:27.081 --> 00:10:29.900
<v Speaker 1>I tried talking to people in Shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>to go with it and it's endless.</v>

264
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.980
<v Speaker 1>There's really no end to how good you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can come as a comic if you keep pushing </v>

<v Speaker 1>they're kind of weak and you can just </v>

267
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:51.421
<v Speaker 1>keep making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:54.040

<v Speaker 1>So that's like,</v>

274
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.860
<v Speaker 1>it's like a meditation on top of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of a workout too because </v>

<v Speaker 1>there's also something too,</v>

<v Speaker 2>What if you're blowing somebody and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just goes wrong?</v>

327
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.470
<v Speaker 2>She just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's 70 years old or so.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She's 85 years old.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She's 128,</v>
<v Speaker 2>58.</v>

330
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.760
<v Speaker 2>He's 10 years older than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's in better shape than I'll ever be </v>

331
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.470
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She seems a lot older than that.</v>

332
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean when we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was already a grown woman.</v>

333
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.730
<v Speaker 2>What she broke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was like 25.</v>

334
00:13:37.731 --> 00:13:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I think she made a quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I was in high school,</v>

335
00:13:40.401 --> 00:13:43.250
<v Speaker 2>I've told this story before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I was like 16 and I was in love</v>

336
00:13:43.251 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 2>with her and I found out she was 27 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

337
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:50.650
<v Speaker 2>that pitches old Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought 27 and then curb at 16.</v>

338
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:58.400
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it just was a retarded.</v>

339
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.880
<v Speaker 2>I was 16.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know anybody,</v>

340
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.990
<v Speaker 2>but I just remembered hearing she was in</v>
<v Speaker 2>her late twenties to over look at her </v>

341
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.820
<v Speaker 2>house when she was kind of Chubby to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

342
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I did think 27 though when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I would see a 27 year old guy.</v>

343
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.680
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got it figured out.</v>

344
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.900
<v Speaker 1>He's on his own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.590
<v Speaker 1>none of this bullshit I'm going through </v>
<v Speaker 1>is all sorted out his fucking head.</v>

346
00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I used to think that I had a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that 48 and I'm just going to be </v>

<v Speaker 1>figuring shit out.</v>

348
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:35.050

<v Speaker 2>Remember when you were a kid and you </v>

<v Speaker 2>thought they were real grownups like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You didn't know you were confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He get yelled at,</v>

351
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:37.550
<v Speaker 2>he gets sent to your room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

352
00:14:37.551 --> 00:14:39.920
<v Speaker 2>one day I'm going to be a grown up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's gonna make sense?</v>

353
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.530
<v Speaker 2>And then one day you're in line at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supermarket and someone goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

404
00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you see someone pulled over </v>

<v Speaker 1>One maid or the nanny.</v>

412
00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.720
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a maid or a nanny</v>

413
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.280
<v Speaker 5>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

414
00:17:03.281 --> 00:17:05.320
<v Speaker 5>if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have to be disgusting.</v>

415
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.140
<v Speaker 5>That's like the unathletic bang.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His nanny.</v>

416
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:09.090
<v Speaker 5>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

417
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.170
<v Speaker 5>That was never confirmed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was never confessed.</v>

418
00:17:11.171 --> 00:17:12.820
<v Speaker 5>She confirmed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

419
00:17:12.821 --> 00:17:14.410
<v Speaker 5>but what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She needs a book deal.</v>

420
00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:15.640
<v Speaker 5>She got fired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>

421
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:20.670
<v Speaker 5>Unless he came out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never fucked her and he never did </v>

422
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:20.670
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

423
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.990
<v Speaker 5>You're going to do that to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a big fan of his.</v>

424
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.860
<v Speaker 5>You know how you didn't like the town?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

425
00:17:26.861 --> 00:17:31.861
<v Speaker 5>I didn't like him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He went on the Bill Maher show cutting </v>

426
00:17:31.861 --> 00:17:33.970
<v Speaker 5>this ridiculous argument with Sam Harris</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I realized what what he's all about.</v>

427
00:17:33.971 --> 00:17:34.540
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

428
00:17:34.541 --> 00:17:36.620
<v Speaker 5>you're one of those guys who's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Colin?</v>

429
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.740
<v Speaker 5>Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>racist,</v>

430
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:42.810
<v Speaker 5>because he was talking about the problem</v>
<v Speaker 5>with ideologies and religions and the </v>

431
00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:43.030
<v Speaker 5>tenants of Islam and he started yelling </v>
<v Speaker 5>at him,</v>

432
00:17:43.031 --> 00:17:45.490
<v Speaker 5>calling him a racist and didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand that.</v>

433
00:17:45.491 --> 00:17:48.820
<v Speaker 5>Sam Harris is actually a scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>knows a lot about religion.</v>

434
00:17:48.821 --> 00:17:51.030
<v Speaker 5>Just way over his head and looked really</v>
<v Speaker 5>stupid.</v>

435
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:56.090
<v Speaker 5>So the only difference between me and </v>
<v Speaker 5>him as he did that on TV and I do it </v>

436
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:56.670
<v Speaker 5>over the phone with friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only difference is you're funny,</v>

437
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.510
<v Speaker 5>you're funny if you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have self deprecating humor.</v>

438
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:01.600
<v Speaker 5>You would have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

439
00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.970
<v Speaker 5>like the fuck am I talking about?</v>

440
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Talk to the guy at the gas station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just stopped at right before I got</v>

441
00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:08.520
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I found out they didn't take credit</v>

442
00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:09.720
<v Speaker 1>cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

443
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:11.140
<v Speaker 1>It just didn't take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

444
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.470
<v Speaker 1>I was mad at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

445
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.180
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a content.</v>

446
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

447
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Because what it was was I was getting up</v>
<v Speaker 1>against being here by 11 and I got to </v>

448
00:18:23.461 --> 00:18:28.461
<v Speaker 1>get home to take my wife out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>house because she's going nuts staying </v>

449
00:18:28.461 --> 00:18:32.211
<v Speaker 1>in the house with the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got that thing and I got assigned </v>

450
00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:32.211
<v Speaker 1>this other fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

451
00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:32.211
<v Speaker 1>life insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

452
00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:36.780
<v Speaker 1>I got to do all this adult shit and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking I got this little window to get</v>

453
00:18:36.781 --> 00:18:39.870
<v Speaker 1>gas and I show up in this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial park.</v>

454
00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:42.400
<v Speaker 1>There's no gas station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finally going all the way down and the</v>

455
00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.610
<v Speaker 1>whole time it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's thrifty and I'm thinking like,</v>

456
00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:46.080
<v Speaker 1>isn't that a fucking car rental place?</v>

457
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.290
<v Speaker 1>So I pull in and I stick to credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

458
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:54.291
<v Speaker 1>I stuck in and I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is too easy because I know I have </v>

459
00:18:54.291 --> 00:18:54.291
<v Speaker 1>the exact amount of time to get her </v>
<v Speaker 1>right on time.</v>

460
00:18:54.291 --> 00:18:56.160
<v Speaker 1>And of course it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this debit?</v>

461
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

466
00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:03.780

<v Speaker 1>I tried to use my credit card.</v>

467
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.640
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

469
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.260
<v Speaker 1>we don't take credit cards here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

470
00:19:07.261 --> 00:19:08.610
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

471
00:19:08.611 --> 00:19:13.611
<v Speaker 1>I'll just take debit card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just kept saying why two year old and </v>

472
00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 1>he finally just goes cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

473
00:19:14.701 --> 00:19:15.300
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good,</v>

474
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:20.990
<v Speaker 1>that's a good excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it gave him like 60 bucks and only </v>

475
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.170
<v Speaker 1>ended up being like 30 nights that I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go back and get my change and he's </v>

476
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:24.170
<v Speaker 1>looking at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say a fucking idiot.</v>

477
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.540
<v Speaker 1>It would have cost you like 15 more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do that all the time.</v>

478
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a big fan of those fucking debit</v>

479
00:19:30.081 --> 00:19:30.940
<v Speaker 5>card.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Only ones.</v>

480
00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.790
<v Speaker 5>That's stupid.</v>

481
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Lynette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never use your debit card,</v>

482
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.450
<v Speaker 1>your credit card anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

483
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Because that's your money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if somebody takes that and then </v>

484
00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:40.500
<v Speaker 1>cleans you out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your shit.</v>

485
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.780
<v Speaker 1>If somebody swipes your credit card </v>
<v Speaker 1>number,</v>

486
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:47.990
<v Speaker 1>that's their money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they call you up and they just </v>

487
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:47.990
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey joe,</v>

488
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.610
<v Speaker 1>did you buy a ham hock and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver had a strip club?</v>

489
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I know I didn't go.</v>

490
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've given me every piece of the </v>

491
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:01.200
<v Speaker 1>fucking elk except that</v>

492
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.890
<v Speaker 5>I've got some ham hock for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some,</v>

493
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.950
<v Speaker 5>some bone he can chop up and make </v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana.</v>

494
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.130
<v Speaker 1>So I got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a buddy of mine who's a lawyer who</v>

495
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:14.570
<v Speaker 1>prosecutes identity theft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of lawyers don't want to do </v>

496
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:15.330
<v Speaker 1>because it's unbelievably tedious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

497
00:20:15.331 --> 00:20:20.331
<v Speaker 1>when they call up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times they call her up the </v>

498
00:20:20.331 --> 00:20:20.331
<v Speaker 1>credit card companies to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

499
00:20:20.331 --> 00:20:22.680
<v Speaker 1>to fight for their case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still have to go through that maze.</v>

500
00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:24.780
<v Speaker 1>If you'd like to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>press one if you'd like to do that,</v>

501
00:20:24.781 --> 00:20:25.790
<v Speaker 1>press two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

502
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.480
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to help them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

503
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:32.690
<v Speaker 1>But that was one thing that I remembered</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all things he told me not to do it </v>

504
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.131
<v Speaker 1>because don't ever use your debit card </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if they get that and they clean </v>

505
00:20:35.131 --> 00:20:35.131
<v Speaker 1>you out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your fucking mind,</v>

506
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:40.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden you get a </v>

507
00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:40.790
<v Speaker 1>mortgage coming up and then you're late </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

508
00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:41.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somebody took my money and blah blah</v>

509
00:20:41.371 --> 00:20:42.540
<v Speaker 1>blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your credit card.</v>

510
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.200
<v Speaker 1>They have to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had it</v>

511
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.220
<v Speaker 5>attempt recently and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

512
00:20:46.221 --> 00:20:46.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking,</v>

513
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:51.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm wondering whether or not it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I switched over to windows </v>

514
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:51.990
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

515
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.110
<v Speaker 5>I had this windows computer now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I get pissed off at Mac.</v>

516
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.520
<v Speaker 5>People got mad at us clearing her throat</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I just cleared my throat again.</v>

517
00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.190
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I switched over to this windows computer</v>

518
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.840
<v Speaker 5>because I get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These MACs,</v>

519
00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.940
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they switched over all the ports and now</v>

520
00:21:03.941 --> 00:21:08.941
<v Speaker 5>you have this Usb c and you have to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>an adapter if you want to use all your </v>

521
00:21:08.941 --> 00:21:12.841
<v Speaker 5>other shit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like you've got Rosetta Stone </v>

522
00:21:12.841 --> 00:21:12.841
<v Speaker 5>French,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

523
00:21:12.841 --> 00:21:13.030
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no place to stick the fucking.</v>

524
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to get an adapter.</v>

525
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.430
<v Speaker 5>You saw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

526
00:21:15.431 --> 00:21:20.431
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about the iphone seven with the </v>

527
00:21:20.431 --> 00:21:20.431
<v Speaker 5>little fucking biblical code lightning </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing?</v>

528
00:21:20.431 --> 00:21:20.431
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

529
00:21:20.431 --> 00:21:22.150
<v Speaker 5>Well you can get a splitter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would that,</v>

530
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.940
<v Speaker 5>where it goes with a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can use a regular headphone Jack,</v>

531
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
<v Speaker 5>but it's all extra money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>extra money and then you fucking lose </v>

532
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.000
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

533
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.750
<v Speaker 5>I think the idea is that eventually </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be some peripherals </v>

534
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.510
<v Speaker 5>that are more powerful and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>work on the existing ports,</v>

535
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.270
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I got this,</v>

536
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:41.280
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this Lenovo thinkpad and I love it and </v>

537
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.130
<v Speaker 5>this is the second one that I got </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's got everything.</v>

538
00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:44.240
<v Speaker 5>It's got an Ethernet port,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's got htmi,</v>

539
00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:45.850
<v Speaker 5>it's got all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's tiny.</v>

540
00:21:45.851 --> 00:21:49.360
<v Speaker 5>The battery life is fucking forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got this fat battery in the bottom.</v>

541
00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:54.361
<v Speaker 5>But for the first time in a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody tried to steal my identity and </v>

542
00:21:54.361 --> 00:21:54.361
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Geez,</v>

543
00:21:54.361 --> 00:21:57.130
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if it's has to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if it's a windows thing.</v>

544
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.040
<v Speaker 5>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not really.</v>

545
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:02.470
<v Speaker 5>Could be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could be something else.</v>

546
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.030
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

547
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:09.380

550
00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:10.870
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's cool.</v>

551

<v Speaker 5>thieves.</v>

570
00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.610
<v Speaker 5>His name was international sale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what we used to call them because</v>

571

573
00:23:04.691 --> 00:23:09.691
<v Speaker 5>was international south because this </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't like the seventies and the </v>

574
00:23:09.691 --> 00:23:09.691
<v Speaker 5>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When credit cards first came out,</v>

575
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.980
<v Speaker 5>he would get those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

576
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.020
<v Speaker 5>those carbon slips from restaurants and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they would make up new credit cards and </v>

577
00:23:16.331 --> 00:23:20.800
<v Speaker 5>then sell them to criminals and he would</v>
<v Speaker 5>just get bags and bags of cash from it.</v>

578
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:26.130
<v Speaker 5>And this guy was gambling who go to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>pool hall that I went to and just,</v>

579
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:32.050
<v Speaker 5>he was like the most perpetual loser </v>
<v Speaker 5>you've ever seen in your life.</v>

580
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:37.080
<v Speaker 5>Like he could not win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a psychological and an Oscar </v>

581
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:37.080
<v Speaker 5>winning movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

582
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:37.900
<v Speaker 5>This guy's life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

583
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.150
<v Speaker 5>in a way it probably should be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

584
00:23:40.151 --> 00:23:41.060
<v Speaker 5>he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was a trip.</v>

585
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.890
<v Speaker 5>So how did he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how did he end up dying cancer bad,</v>

586
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 5>but colon cancer,</v>

587
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.390
<v Speaker 1>it was a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was real bad.</v>

588
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:53.120
<v Speaker 1>And a buddy of mine's Hollywood would </v>
<v Speaker 1>switch up the script just to calm and go</v>

589
00:23:53.121 --> 00:23:57.560
<v Speaker 1>off a bridge like Thelma and Louise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

590
00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:02.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened to me the other </v>

591
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.451
<v Speaker 1>night when I was onstage and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>joking about men going to the moon and </v>

592
00:24:04.451 --> 00:24:05.450
<v Speaker 1>somebody yelled out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go see hidden figures.</v>

593
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.200
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

594
00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:09.080
<v Speaker 1>because that's a history book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just saw how people.</v>

595
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying those obviously is women </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed,</v>

596
00:24:11.031 --> 00:24:16.031

<v Speaker 1>Then now they're going to do the </v>

597
00:24:16.031 --> 00:24:16.980
<v Speaker 1>overcorrection where it was like these </v>
<v Speaker 1>three women are there.</v>

598
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:20.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just like every time that you see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture of like NASA,</v>

599
00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:23.720
<v Speaker 1>you'll see like a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 100 worker bees.</v>

600

<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows their fucking names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we got there because of all of</v>

601
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:32.201
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>

602
00:24:32.201 --> 00:24:32.201
<v Speaker 1>wins a championship.</v>

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.890
<v Speaker 1>and your foot like your instep of </v>
<v Speaker 1>slamming to the elbow.</v>

662
00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:01.920
<v Speaker 1>after watching my wife go through labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything,</v>

663
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I said the only men that could actually </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's worse than that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

675
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:34.970
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty prepared and there was some</v>
<v Speaker 1>code or something like that as I was </v>

676
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:34.970

<v Speaker 1>She's just really like,</v>

692
00:28:06.701 --> 00:28:08.680

00:28:08.681 --> 00:28:11.920
<v Speaker 1>like very few people I've met in my life</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have like an energy.</v>

694
00:28:11.921 --> 00:28:12.940
<v Speaker 1>We just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

695
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be around that.</v>

696
00:28:15.221 --> 00:28:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Like she just had this amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

697
00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:20.260
<v Speaker 1>like really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she just throws herself into shit.</v>

698
00:28:20.261 --> 00:28:21.850
<v Speaker 1>And I was really kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

699
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was more like garden and all of that,</v>

700
00:28:24.641 --> 00:28:26.750
<v Speaker 1>so it was sort of the perfect kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>

701
00:28:26.751 --> 00:28:29.200
<v Speaker 1>But every time I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've seen the end of,</v>

702
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.110
<v Speaker 1>of that energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she does something else.</v>

703
00:28:32.111 --> 00:28:33.850
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty,</v>

704
00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:35.350
<v Speaker 1>pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's good.</v>

705
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:37.530
<v Speaker 5>Great relationship then you're both </v>
<v Speaker 5>growing,</v>

706
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:38.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's growing in your.</v>

707
00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no dude,</v>

708
00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:45.150
<v Speaker 1>she's hit me with some fucking classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines and one time she was calling her </v>

709
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:47.710
<v Speaker 1>out on some shit she was doing and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just took it like a little too far.</v>

710
00:28:47.711 --> 00:28:50.740
<v Speaker 1>I should've stopped like probably five </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes early and I was still going,</v>

711
00:28:50.741 --> 00:28:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking blah blah blah,</v>

712
00:28:52.031 --> 00:28:53.290
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you do this.</v>

713
00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:55.060
<v Speaker 1>And I was in the car and right as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

714
00:28:55.061 --> 00:28:55.690
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

715
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:56.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

716
00:28:56.771 --> 00:29:01.771
<v Speaker 1>pony righty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That my friend and we both just burst </v>

717
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.400
<v Speaker 1>out laughing and that was just like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the fight.</v>

718
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.930
<v Speaker 1>So she has that ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

719
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.080
<v Speaker 1>we're in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

720
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would date people either they were too</v>

721
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:18.320
<v Speaker 1>nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they couldn't handle how fucked up I </v>

722
00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.291
<v Speaker 1>was or the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would just as fucked up as I was </v>

723
00:29:21.291 --> 00:29:21.291
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was totally toxic.</v>

724
00:29:21.291 --> 00:29:22.830
<v Speaker 1>So she's just sorta like grounded.</v>

725
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:23.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

726
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:29.210
<v Speaker 5>that's so important when you're dating </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody or married somebody or </v>

727
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.970
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have to compliment you and you have</v>

728
00:29:29.971 --> 00:29:33.450
<v Speaker 5>to compliment them some sort of a way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't be the exactly the same.</v>

729
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:37.380
<v Speaker 5>And who you are is different when you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>with different people,</v>

730
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:42.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're with a person like that who </v>

731
00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:42.560
<v Speaker 5>can crack a joke in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>heat of everything,</v>

732
00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.130
<v Speaker 5>you'd be become a different person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They become a different person.</v>

733
00:29:45.131 --> 00:29:50.131
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if she's with somebody who doesn't </v>

734
00:29:50.131 --> 00:29:50.131
<v Speaker 5>appreciate that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

735
00:29:50.131 --> 00:29:52.180
<v Speaker 5>it's just like you become,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're not just an individual,</v>

736
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:57.300
<v Speaker 5>you're an individual who relates to </v>
<v Speaker 5>other people and you become someone </v>

737
00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.060
<v Speaker 5>different when you relate to those </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

738
00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

739
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.710
<v Speaker 1>it took me forever to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

740
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:08.730
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I can't break up with this </v>

741
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.030
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I figured out I was in love.</v>

742
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one too though.</v>

743
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

744
00:30:12.191 --> 00:30:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Every time I pictured breaking up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

745
00:30:13.991 --> 00:30:16.360
<v Speaker 1>I kept picturing her walking away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then me going like,</v>

746
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:16.650
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

747
00:30:16.651 --> 00:30:16.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

748
00:30:16.871 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then after denying that,</v>

749
00:30:20.771 --> 00:30:22.780
<v Speaker 1>that was love for a good fucking eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

750
00:30:22.781 --> 00:30:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

751
00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:28.621
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I have found the one doesn't </v>

752
00:30:28.621 --> 00:30:30.810
<v Speaker 1>abused word love is way too many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing that word around like a beach </v>

753
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.350
<v Speaker 1>ball at a concert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just to abused all of that shit and</v>

754
00:30:32.351 --> 00:30:35.530
<v Speaker 1>then like all of that stuff that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that when you first see a kid,</v>

755
00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.620
<v Speaker 1>like they fill your head up on what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you supposed to feel?</v>

756
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about this on a thick on </v>
<v Speaker 1>kimball,</v>

757
00:30:42.231 --> 00:30:44.680
<v Speaker 1>like w what I saw my kid for the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

758
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid.</v>

759
00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:47.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have that.</v>

760
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Just start crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

761
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.520
<v Speaker 1>hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I sorta just put my finger down,</v>

762
00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:56.521
<v Speaker 1>let it hold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they left me alone with the </v>

763
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:58.550
<v Speaker 1>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the magnitude of it was,</v>

764
00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.830
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was definitely huge.</v>

765
00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:02.050
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't feel that whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

766
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second I saw my kid,</v>

767
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I knew my life had changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't feel that for like 12 </v>

768
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:09.990
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until the next.</v>

769
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.640
<v Speaker 1>But I think it was my head was so filled</v>
<v Speaker 1>up on what I was supposed.</v>

770
00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:15.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like having an outer body </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and it wasn't until,</v>

771
00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:20.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next morning my wife was playing </v>

772
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:20.770
<v Speaker 1>like stevie wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

773
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:20.770
<v Speaker 1>what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some chill music and stuff.</v>

774
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:21.940
<v Speaker 1>And I was just sitting with her and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of,</v>

775
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:22.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

776
00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.650
<v Speaker 1>baby baby sneezes or something like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just.</v>

777
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.030
<v Speaker 1>And it just fucking hits Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

778
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even then I never had like that </v>

779
00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:31.160
<v Speaker 1>blubbering moment.</v>

780
00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:35.310
<v Speaker 5>To me it was kind of scary too and kind </v>
<v Speaker 5>of psychedelic because when,</v>

781
00:31:36.161 --> 00:31:38.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when my daughter was born,</v>

782
00:31:38.531 --> 00:31:41.620
<v Speaker 5>my eight year old was born.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a moment what I was thinking,</v>

783
00:31:41.621 --> 00:31:46.621
<v Speaker 5>how many babies are being born </v>
<v Speaker 5>simultaneously right now all over the </v>

784
00:31:46.621 --> 00:31:47.890
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you could look at it on a screen,</v>

785
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:52.810
<v Speaker 5>it would be a swarm of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just just heads popping out of pussies.</v>

786
00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:57.811
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you could see every baby coming out </v>

787
00:31:57.811 --> 00:31:59.920
<v Speaker 5>right now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then our thought at the same time,</v>

788
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:03.370
<v Speaker 5>I thought about this baby becoming an </v>
<v Speaker 5>old lady and dying.</v>

789
00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:08.640
<v Speaker 5>And I thought like how many old people </v>
<v Speaker 5>are dying simultaneously at the same </v>

790
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:08.640
<v Speaker 5>time right now?</v>

791
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

792
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.050
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually this way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because every,</v>

793
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:15.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hacky thing is you're supposed to </v>

794
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.931
<v Speaker 1>say the second I saw my kid I burst out </v>
<v Speaker 1>crying and blah blah blah blah blah.</v>

795
00:32:17.121 --> 00:32:19.700
<v Speaker 1>And then so then it becomes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do that,</v>

796
00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.100
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be a good dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't care.</v>

797
00:32:22.101 --> 00:32:27.101
<v Speaker 1>And all of that type of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I just think that that kind of </v>

798
00:32:27.101 --> 00:32:27.101
<v Speaker 1>became like the Hacky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

799
00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.450
<v Speaker 1>default thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I also,</v>

800
00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:34.540
<v Speaker 1>this is all just theories of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not going to research any of </v>

801
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.181
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think parents try to outdo each </v>

802
00:32:37.181 --> 00:32:37.850
<v Speaker 1>other with their stories about what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck they felt.</v>

803
00:32:37.851 --> 00:32:39.080
<v Speaker 1>And it's just because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really,</v>

804
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.210
<v Speaker 1>they're really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not saying people,</v>

805
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.960
<v Speaker 1>most parents know and I've learned to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of already be like,</v>

806
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:51.400
<v Speaker 1>they'll just sit down next to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your forrest gump and they'll just </v>

807
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:51.890
<v Speaker 1>sit down and just start talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just said,</v>

808
00:32:51.891 --> 00:32:53.660
<v Speaker 1>you kid all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the switch got to watch out for,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I remember my kid and blah blah blah</v>

811
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.640
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With a fucking person.</v>

812
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.590
<v Speaker 1>He talks to them when you want to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

813
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.450
<v Speaker 5>just wait until you start going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>school.</v>

814
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.960
<v Speaker 5>Then you gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gotTa hang out with these parents </v>

815
00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.521
<v Speaker 5>all the time because your kids become </v>
<v Speaker 5>friends with their kids and then you </v>

816
00:33:09.521 --> 00:33:10.550
<v Speaker 5>become friends with these people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you would never be fucking friends with.</v>

817
00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.430
<v Speaker 1>This is what I do is I just looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight ahead and I don't look at him,</v>

818
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:19.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't respond to what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they just solely talk quieter </v>

819
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:19.440
<v Speaker 1>and they gradually leave.</v>

820
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.660
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to go to dinner </v>
<v Speaker 5>with them.</v>

821
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.440
<v Speaker 5>Your wife's going to be friends with </v>
<v Speaker 5>some lady.</v>

822
00:33:22.441 --> 00:33:23.880
<v Speaker 5>You're going to go on a double date.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

823
00:33:23.881 --> 00:33:24.990
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to go.</v>

824
00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.740
<v Speaker 5>This is one guy now he he talks and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't look at you.</v>

825
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:34.040
<v Speaker 5>He tells me these fucking stupid stories</v>
<v Speaker 5>about his kid and the basketball team </v>

826
00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:34.710
<v Speaker 5>and he looks at you for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

827
00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.350
<v Speaker 5>so Adam is in his basketball team and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they start looking down.</v>

828
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:42.430
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did the coach won't put them in the </v>

829
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:43.731
<v Speaker 5>game?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying like if he gets a good </v>

830
00:33:43.731 --> 00:33:43.731
<v Speaker 5>player could play.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I come in,</v>

831
00:33:43.731 --> 00:33:44.730
<v Speaker 5>I can put them in the game and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking rambling.</v>

832
00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:49.020
<v Speaker 5>Rambling with no regard whatsoever for </v>
<v Speaker 5>your attention span.</v>

833
00:33:49.021 --> 00:33:50.760
<v Speaker 5>The entertainment value of what he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying.</v>

834
00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:54.060
<v Speaker 5>He's just the underlying insecurity of </v>
<v Speaker 5>not being able to look at you.</v>

835
00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's so in self-involved.</v>

836
00:33:55.910 --> 00:34:00.910
<v Speaker 5>He's self involved is doing some weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing with his hands were just like </v>

837
00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:01.680
<v Speaker 5>click talking with his hands and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>going Jesus Christ.</v>

838
00:34:01.681 --> 00:34:04.670
<v Speaker 5>Like literally like someone's fantasize </v>
<v Speaker 5>about doing tool,</v>

839
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:06.420
<v Speaker 5>not just running,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just running away.</v>

840
00:34:06.421 --> 00:34:08.040
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to hurt him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy's hurt by life.</v>

841
00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.500
<v Speaker 5>He's so damaged by live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to do anything to him.</v>

842
00:34:10.501 --> 00:34:11.670
<v Speaker 5>I just wanna get the fuck away.</v>

843
00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I always picture those people and I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a giant roll of duct tape.</v>

844
00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:19.930
<v Speaker 6>I just put it on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like a cartoon level speed.</v>

845
00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:21.700
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's cartoon level.</v>

846
00:34:21.701 --> 00:34:26.701
<v Speaker 6>I just put it on their mouth and I go </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the last one it comes up and over </v>

847
00:34:26.741 --> 00:34:31.741
<v Speaker 6>their head and then it hangs down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The whole rest of the tape is hanging </v>

848
00:34:31.741 --> 00:34:35.131
<v Speaker 6>down over there awkwardly and then I </v>
<v Speaker 6>just go back to eating or whatever and </v>

849
00:34:36.881 --> 00:34:39.190
<v Speaker 6>they just sit there and slowly have to </v>
<v Speaker 6>take it off.</v>

850
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.270
<v Speaker 5>It is some brutal fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

851
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:49.330
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of weird people that </v>

852
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:49.330
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

853
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:50.870
<v Speaker 5>you get closer to them and closer to </v>
<v Speaker 5>them and you find out about their life.</v>

854
00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:52.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know what?</v>

855
00:34:52.311 --> 00:34:53.480

<v Speaker 5>I want to do that too.</v>

856
00:34:53.481 --> 00:34:55.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they're talking about me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so for sure.</v>

857
00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:56.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

858
00:34:56.361 --> 00:34:59.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they talked about me too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just how it seemed like he was in</v>

859
00:34:59.601 --> 00:35:01.250
<v Speaker 5>a bad mood now all the time.</v>

860
00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:01.880
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

861
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is friend of Ron White,</v>

862
00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.820
<v Speaker 5>who's a friend of mine who uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first time we met him he was like,</v>

863
00:35:07.821 --> 00:35:08.460
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

864
00:35:08.461 --> 00:35:09.350
<v Speaker 5>And Ron's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you,</v>

865
00:35:09.351 --> 00:35:11.780
<v Speaker 5>he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he's a dad too,</v>

866
00:35:11.781 --> 00:35:13.850
<v Speaker 5>and we're all buddies together now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's like,</v>

867
00:35:13.851 --> 00:35:14.600
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

868
00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:19.850
<v Speaker 5>I'm guarded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been beaten down by some of these </v>

869
00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.481
<v Speaker 5>fucking basketball stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's these assholes will tell you I had </v>

870
00:35:22.481 --> 00:35:22.760
<v Speaker 5>my kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a good player player.</v>

871
00:35:22.761 --> 00:35:27.761
<v Speaker 5>Did you want to put them in the game?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just you think of things that you would </v>

872
00:35:29.031 --> 00:35:30.950
<v Speaker 5>torture somebody talking about and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

873
00:35:30.951 --> 00:35:32.630
<v Speaker 5>I would never do this to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why are you doing this to me?</v>

874
00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.490
<v Speaker 5>You're not even thinking about verbal </v>
<v Speaker 5>water</v>

875
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 6>like in your own</v>

876
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.360
<v Speaker 2>little Guantanamo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great way to describe me.</v>

877
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Like when is the desert trade coming?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could say I don't need dessert.</v>

878
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the problem with hanging </v>
<v Speaker 2>around with comedians too.</v>

879
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:52.140
<v Speaker 2>So when they say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a good percentage of it,</v>

880
00:35:52.141 --> 00:35:57.141
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be funny all the </v>

881
00:35:57.141 --> 00:35:58.521
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a good percentage when you talking </v>

882
00:35:58.521 --> 00:35:58.521
<v Speaker 2>to people that aren't funny at all and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it never comes.</v>

883
00:35:58.521 --> 00:36:00.270
<v Speaker 2>He likes surely there's something funny </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming.</v>

884
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Eventually nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>

885
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.350
<v Speaker 2>never something compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing,</v>

886
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:09.440
<v Speaker 2>not a goddamn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just coach and that's when I start </v>

887
00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:13.260
<v Speaker 2>thinking like those duct tape fantasies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I start making myself laugh and</v>

888
00:36:13.261 --> 00:36:18.261
<v Speaker 2>I have to pretend like I'm drinking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they get all weirded out because </v>

889
00:36:18.261 --> 00:36:21.441
<v Speaker 2>they see some weird look on my face and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it just fucking.</v>

890
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.040
<v Speaker 2>It just goes south.</v>

891
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:24.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd usually breathe.</v>

892
00:36:24.811 --> 00:36:29.811
<v Speaker 5>I take these breathing exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do the Wim Hoff method where I took </v>

893
00:36:29.811 --> 00:36:31.310
<v Speaker 5>all my breath in and I let like 15,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 percent.</v>

894
00:36:31.311 --> 00:36:31.460
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

895
00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:36.930
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you do that across from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal.</v>

896
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:38.690
<v Speaker 2>I guess if he's not looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't see it.</v>

897
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

898
00:36:39.321 --> 00:36:44.321
<v Speaker 2>I do like to watch ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any noise just got shot and you're </v>

899
00:36:44.321 --> 00:36:46.090
<v Speaker 2>waiting for the ambulance when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing good.</v>

900
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Just trying to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stay consciously put together,</v>

901
00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:52.760
<v Speaker 2>try to stay present.</v>

902
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.790
<v Speaker 5>I try to meditate in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 5>overwhelming retarded conversation.</v>

903
00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:00.750
<v Speaker 5>Just trying to detach myself from </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever they're saying,</v>

904
00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:02.400
<v Speaker 5>find a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>find a happy place,</v>

905
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.890
<v Speaker 5>find a peaceful spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever get raw?</v>

906
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.190
<v Speaker 5>You know what Rolfing is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a form of like deep,</v>

907
00:37:08.191 --> 00:37:10.620
<v Speaker 5>deep tissue massage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>brutally painful shit.</v>

908
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:11.830
<v Speaker 5>Brutally painful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

909
00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.560
<v Speaker 5>I get robbed and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy,</v>

911
00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:17.250
<v Speaker 5>He's fucking rough and he knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do it.</v>

912
00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:18.920
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy's rough target.</v>

<v Speaker 5>he has a metal bar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

915
00:37:22.471 --> 00:37:24.090
<v Speaker 5>it really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems like a torture device.</v>

916
00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:27.390
<v Speaker 5>It looks like a chisel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a fat wide Chisel and it has like a</v>

917
00:37:27.391 --> 00:37:32.391
<v Speaker 5>thin layer of like rubber over it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he takes this metal bar that has </v>

918
00:37:32.391 --> 00:37:32.391
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a handle,</v>

919
00:37:32.391 --> 00:37:32.760
<v Speaker 5>like a sword.</v>

920
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:36.870
<v Speaker 2>He's wearing a mask at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm naked unfortunately.</v>

921
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.760
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's</v>

922
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.960
<v Speaker 5>digging this fucking thing into my back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean digging it in like all of his </v>

923
00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.190
<v Speaker 5>weight and he's like pop popping over </v>
<v Speaker 5>the scar tissue.</v>

924
00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:47.840
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

925
00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.530
<v Speaker 5>I have to go deep into my mind when he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing it.</v>

926
00:37:51.531 --> 00:37:53.570
<v Speaker 5>I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just go deeper and deep.</v>

927
00:37:53.571 --> 00:37:55.580
<v Speaker 5>My eyes are closed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my faces in that thing.</v>

928
00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.110
<v Speaker 5>And then when you get a massage and that</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>

929
00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:03.250
<v Speaker 5>you could see my face and bill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like pushed and smushed into the </v>

930
00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:04.340
<v Speaker 5>little massage chair thing or massage </v>
<v Speaker 5>table thing</v>

931
00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.880
<v Speaker 2>they're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When that red bull jumped,</v>

932
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.500
<v Speaker 5>buddy is a world champion at that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's.</v>

933
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.860
<v Speaker 5>He's traveled more in that flying </v>
<v Speaker 5>squirrel suit.</v>

934
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.840
<v Speaker 5>He's traveled to further distances than </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

935
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.280
<v Speaker 2>Do that red bull jumped that fucking guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

936
00:38:17.281 --> 00:38:22.281
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like he was just fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just falling like a stone from </v>

937
00:38:22.281 --> 00:38:23.940
<v Speaker 2>space over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about the guy that fell into a net?</v>

938
00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just did the comment.</v>

939
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.110
<v Speaker 2>I totally derailed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

940
00:38:28.111 --> 00:38:28.780
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

941
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:33.810
<v Speaker 2>I find my happy space while this guy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this and I have to do that.</v>

942
00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going,</v>

943
00:38:36.011 --> 00:38:41.011
<v Speaker 2>I go deeper and deeper in my mind to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignore the pain because the pain is so </v>

944
00:38:41.011 --> 00:38:43.840
<v Speaker 2>intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk Basketball Guy is.</v>

945
00:38:43.841 --> 00:38:48.841
<v Speaker 2>If I already told my wife that he did it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it annoyed me and then what I would </v>

946
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:51.640
<v Speaker 2>do is I would just be egging him on </v>
<v Speaker 2>going like,</v>

947
00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:56.641
<v Speaker 2>so why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why doesn't he play him and just and </v>

948
00:38:56.641 --> 00:38:59.580
<v Speaker 2>just keep going and then she would start</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking me under the table because she </v>

949
00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:03.571
<v Speaker 2>would start laughing and then I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to turn what he was doing into a </v>

950
00:39:03.571 --> 00:39:03.571
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

951
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.910
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way to do it or else I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>just going to say.</v>

952
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:12.030
<v Speaker 2>I would probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I actually dealt with the emotion of </v>

953
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.030
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would probably start crying.</v>

954
00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:13.700
<v Speaker 2>I would probably just break down and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

955
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.920
<v Speaker 2>fucking doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

956
00:39:15.921 --> 00:39:20.921
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like I have to talk to the </v>

957
00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:20.921
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I wish I could die.</v>

958
00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Get them high on ecstasy and talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

959
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Just get them to completely remove all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his insecurities and fears and it'd </v>

960
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:27.480
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

961
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:32.221
<v Speaker 2>when you talk to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to be thinking that they're </v>

962
00:39:32.221 --> 00:39:32.221
<v Speaker 2>listening to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can great suggestion for.</v>

963
00:39:32.221 --> 00:39:33.340
<v Speaker 2>If you have to keep going out with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple like that,</v>

964
00:39:33.341 --> 00:39:38.341
<v Speaker 2>you gotta get the corner booth so then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not directly across from each </v>

965
00:39:38.341 --> 00:39:38.950
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't have to look at him.</v>

966
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:39.370
<v Speaker 2>You can just.</v>

967
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.600
<v Speaker 2>You can just sit there in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation nodding and he's not going to</v>

968
00:39:42.601 --> 00:39:46.300
<v Speaker 2>be looking at USC and it's peripheral as</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're actively listening and you can</v>

969
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:48.220
<v Speaker 2>be looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what this guy,</v>

970
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:52.520
<v Speaker 2>he clarion we'll get you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a little on the spectrum or</v>

971
00:39:52.521 --> 00:39:53.590
<v Speaker 2>something going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

972
00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:54.760
<v Speaker 2>if it bleeds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can kill.</v>

973
00:39:54.761 --> 00:39:59.470
<v Speaker 2>It is a detachment detachment to way he </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicates where it just,</v>

974
00:39:59.471 --> 00:40:04.471
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems like socially he's not present is </v>

975
00:40:04.471 --> 00:40:06.040
<v Speaker 2>very odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very odd method of communication.</v>

00:40:48.761 --> 00:40:50.470
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>turn around.</v>

998
00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.550
<v Speaker 2>So he's steering himself and at the very</v>
<v Speaker 2>last minute,</v>

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:41.330
<v Speaker 2>but I get this guy on one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube videos,</v>

1039
00:42:41.331 --> 00:42:46.331
<v Speaker 2>the guy who was climbing up the tree to </v>
<v Speaker 2>chop it down or something and he just </v>

1040
00:42:46.331 --> 00:42:49.670
<v Speaker 2>fell and he went straight down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shattered both of his legs and dude,</v>

1041
00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.290
<v Speaker 2>don't pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

1042
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I've never walked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always look away the sound.</v>

1043
00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:57.500
<v Speaker 2>He was just in the woods because he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>filmed himself doing.</v>

1044
00:42:57.501 --> 00:42:58.310
<v Speaker 2>He was just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd you say?</v>

1045
00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Like fucking over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like his soul.</v>

1046
00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:12.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean like if you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he had a fucking loaded nine </v>

1047
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:12.480
<v Speaker 2>millimeter within reach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have blew his brains out.</v>

1048
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Like that was the level of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1049
00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That happens.</v>

1050
00:43:15.461 --> 00:43:16.330
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>

1051
00:43:16.331 --> 00:43:17.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make tree stands,</v>

1052
00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.470
<v Speaker 2>they setup tree stands and some guys are</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough guys.</v>

1053
00:43:20.471 --> 00:43:23.200
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to wear a harness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they have these harnesses that most</v>

1054
00:43:23.201 --> 00:43:25.210
<v Speaker 2>people where they strap around your </v>
<v Speaker 2>waist,</v>

1055
00:43:25.211 --> 00:43:30.211
<v Speaker 2>they strap around your legs and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>hooks to the tree so you can't fall off </v>

1056
00:43:30.211 --> 00:43:34.171
<v Speaker 2>the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of guys that want to </v>

1057
00:43:34.171 --> 00:43:35.881
<v Speaker 2>be tough guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they climb up these tree stands and </v>

1058
00:43:35.881 --> 00:43:38.521
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a harness on and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall off the tree stand and you know </v>

1059
00:43:38.521 --> 00:43:38.950
<v Speaker 2>you're falling 30 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

1060
00:43:38.951 --> 00:43:39.460
<v Speaker 2>and you're just.</v>

1061
00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:44.700
<v Speaker 2>You just fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you got to cry out of the woods or </v>

1062
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:48.001
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or someone finds you days later and you </v>

1063
00:43:48.001 --> 00:43:50.580
<v Speaker 2>started death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is anybody fallen out of the tree stand </v>

1064
00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:52.160
<v Speaker 2>and then getting eaten by what they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of.</v>

1065
00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:57.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that's happened for bears </v>

1066
00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:57.540
<v Speaker 2>because people go bear hunting and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1067
00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.500
<v Speaker 2>They'd go bear hunting and tree stands a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guarantee.</v>

1068
00:43:59.501 --> 00:44:01.540
<v Speaker 2>If someone's been eating that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent,</v>

1069
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:03.430
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>

1070
00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:04.640
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no chance.</v>

1071
00:44:04.641 --> 00:44:09.641
<v Speaker 2>That hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To have enough confidence in my ability </v>

1072
00:44:09.641 --> 00:44:13.380
<v Speaker 2>to secure a tree stand correctly past a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain height and knowing that a bear </v>

1073
00:44:13.781 --> 00:44:16.810
<v Speaker 2>was going to become a tooth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just to those two factors of,</v>

1074
00:44:16.811 --> 00:44:19.360
<v Speaker 2>of falling that length and then also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1075
00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:24.570
<v Speaker 2>it may be right in front of a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's more fucked up is how fast the </v>

1076
00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:26.080
<v Speaker 2>bear can get up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A tree bears.</v>

1077
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:28.570
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They run up a fucking tree,</v>

1078
00:44:28.571 --> 00:44:30.520
<v Speaker 2>like they're running on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

1079
00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.710
<v Speaker 2>The only up to a certain size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's,</v>

1080
00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 2>what's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when they get to be like 400 pounds</v>

1081
00:44:36.421 --> 00:44:38.250
<v Speaker 2>plus they really can't make it up trees </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1082
00:44:38.251 --> 00:44:43.251
<v Speaker 2>They're too heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're nails can't support their </v>

1083
00:44:43.251 --> 00:44:43.251
<v Speaker 2>bodyweight on Tuesdays are for </v>
<v Speaker 2>grizzlies.</v>

1084
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.960
<v Speaker 2>They've begun to wade into the water to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get this salmon.</v>

1085
00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do it?</v>

1086
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:54.210
<v Speaker 2>It's really more and more black bears </v>
<v Speaker 2>then grizzlies or run up trees.</v>

1087
00:44:54.211 --> 00:44:55.190
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1088
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.460
<v Speaker 2>they run up those fucking trees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just brought it up and the up like,</v>

1089
00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:00.570
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1090
00:45:00.571 --> 00:45:02.490
<v Speaker 2>There's a youtube video of a guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1091
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:08.030
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those stands in the fucking </v>

1092
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:10.551
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks up and just runs up the tree next </v>

1093
00:45:10.551 --> 00:45:10.551
<v Speaker 2>to him and now it's above him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1094
00:45:10.551 --> 00:45:11.520
<v Speaker 2>in seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In seconds.</v>

1095
00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:13.740
<v Speaker 2>That's like when you get in fighting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a football stadium,</v>

1096
00:45:13.741 --> 00:45:15.300
<v Speaker 2>you want to be in the row behind the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

1097
00:45:15.301 --> 00:45:17.160
<v Speaker 2>so you're punching down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh for sure.</v>

1098
00:45:17.161 --> 00:45:22.161
<v Speaker 2>Bear went from being on the field too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two rows behind this guy and the </v>

1099
00:45:22.161 --> 00:45:23.100
<v Speaker 2>guy sitting there with his fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he had.</v>

1100
00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.900
<v Speaker 2>Bow and Arrow or something.</v>

1101
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1102
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:31.160
<v Speaker 2>It's bone now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bear doesn't know what a bow and </v>

1103
00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.531
<v Speaker 2>Arrow is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of just slowly turned and </v>

1104
00:45:33.531 --> 00:45:33.531
<v Speaker 2>looked at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot him right in the nose.</v>

1105
00:45:33.531 --> 00:45:34.380
<v Speaker 2>Can you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1106
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:39.440
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not going to kill them </v>

1107
00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.750
<v Speaker 2>instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is they're going </v>

1108
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:43.761
<v Speaker 2>to get a hold of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like have a bear was right there in </v>

1109
00:45:43.761 --> 00:45:43.761
<v Speaker 2>front of you and you shot it with a bow </v>
<v Speaker 2>and arrow.</v>

1110
00:45:43.761 --> 00:45:45.030
<v Speaker 2>There's two things that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1111
00:45:45.031 --> 00:45:47.010
<v Speaker 2>it could run away or to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can attack you.</v>

1112
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:51.000
<v Speaker 2>And if it decides to attack you by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time it expires,</v>

1113
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.520
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take like 30 seconds for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to die.</v>

1114
00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:57.120
<v Speaker 2>And by the time it expires it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking mall.</v>

1115
00:45:57.121 --> 00:45:57.990
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah know.</v>

1116
00:45:57.991 --> 00:46:02.991
<v Speaker 2>But Leonardo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got attacked for like a minute and a </v>

1117
00:46:02.991 --> 00:46:03.180
<v Speaker 2>half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it if you seen hidden figures.</v>

1118
00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:09.840
<v Speaker 2>I found out that Leonardo story was </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposedly based on a true story.</v>

1119
00:46:09.841 --> 00:46:14.841
<v Speaker 2>We had Steve Rinella in here was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>historian on the ancient wild west Shit </v>

1120
00:46:14.841 --> 00:46:15.960
<v Speaker 2>and he told me it was all bullshit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1121
00:46:15.961 --> 00:46:17.940
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy did get mauled by a bear.</v>

1122
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he got away and he crawled back to </v>

1123
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:23.220
<v Speaker 2>camp and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he didn't have a son.</v>

1124
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:28.310
<v Speaker 2>His son never got killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was no sudden like they made </v>

1125
00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:28.310
<v Speaker 2>all that shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1126
00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Nobody fell off the cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

1127
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.440
<v Speaker 2>if you actually made movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how shit really happens.</v>

1128
00:46:31.441 --> 00:46:36.441
<v Speaker 2>It would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like you'd have to watch that </v>

1129
00:46:36.441 --> 00:46:36.441
<v Speaker 2>guy in the fucking restaurant with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>not looking at people.</v>

1130
00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:41.970
<v Speaker 2>That's how they would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why people go to movies because </v>

1131
00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:42.410
<v Speaker 2>you gotta have like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well my mom,</v>

1132
00:46:42.411 --> 00:46:47.411
<v Speaker 2>my wife was watching that women's march </v>
<v Speaker 2>after awhile he couldn't watch it </v>

1133
00:46:47.411 --> 00:46:47.411
<v Speaker 2>anymore because it wasn't going </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>

1134
00:46:47.411 --> 00:46:51.410
<v Speaker 2>It was 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people standing outside of grain with </v>

1135
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:51.410
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will all in the same page.</v>

1136
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:55.730
<v Speaker 2>They would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing like it didn't go </v>

1137
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:55.980
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No arrests all over the country.</v>

1138
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Millions of people marched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No arrests.</v>

1139
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.850
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's because they're women.</v>

1140
00:46:59.851 --> 00:47:00.390
<v Speaker 2>You can't hit them.</v>

1141
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.700
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If those were guys,</v>

1142
00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:10.701
<v Speaker 2>eventually the cops would be sick of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and then they'd send a plain </v>

1143
00:47:10.701 --> 00:47:10.701
<v Speaker 2>clothes guy to go down and light a car </v>
<v Speaker 2>on fire.</v>

1144
00:47:10.701 --> 00:47:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cops were there taking pictures with </v>

1145
00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:15.440
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cops were wearing those pussy hats.</v>

1146
00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:19.290
<v Speaker 2>It was cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's photos of cops with a pink hats </v>

1147
00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:19.840
<v Speaker 2>with the with ears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like kitty cat hats.</v>

1148
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.460
<v Speaker 2>No casinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1149
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:27.550
<v Speaker 2>He did amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one comment the guy makes on a bus </v>

1150

<v Speaker 2>woman off camera that none of us want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know when you want to convict him on </v>

1267
00:51:49.361 --> 00:51:49.750
<v Speaker 2>what he might've said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ivy,</v>

1268
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.820
<v Speaker 2>he might've been like fucking like </v>
<v Speaker 2>lightheaded.</v>

1269
00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.890
<v Speaker 2>I think he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was growing like inside</v>

1270
00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:03.300
<v Speaker 2>with his mouth shut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could not convict anybody who's </v>

1271
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.490
<v Speaker 2>convicted in a court of law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are legal or illegal.</v>

1272
00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:09.250
<v Speaker 2>You are judging podcast humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am judging them.</v>

1273
00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:14.780
<v Speaker 2>You just send them to the chair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the podcast court is a lot like </v>

1274
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:14.780
<v Speaker 2>civil court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1275
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:15.430
<v Speaker 2>criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal court,</v>

1276
00:52:15.431 --> 00:52:18.520
<v Speaker 2>you need a lot more evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I got off in criminal court.</v>

1277
00:52:18.521 --> 00:52:22.030
<v Speaker 2>I never understood that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets off when you need more evidence,</v>

1278
00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.250
<v Speaker 2>less evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has to give away all his shit.</v>

1279
00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:25.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

1280
00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:26.710
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

1281
00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:31.740
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you need more evidence that he </v>

1282
00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:31.740
<v Speaker 2>did it or he didn't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be like acquitted.</v>

1283
00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:31.900
<v Speaker 2>You didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1284
00:52:31.901 --> 00:52:34.240
<v Speaker 2>now you got to give me your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your trophies in your house.</v>

1285
00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

1286
00:52:35.081 --> 00:52:37.480
<v Speaker 2>And you fucking tie tacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck does that work?</v>

1287
00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:42.540
<v Speaker 2>How can they have a civil court where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have less evidence and that's where </v>

1288
00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:44.030
<v Speaker 2>all your money goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your freedom is worth more.</v>

1289
00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:49.810
<v Speaker 2>It works out because um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or sort of worked out.</v>

1290
00:52:49.811 --> 00:52:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I think he moved to Florida to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>around it.</v>

1291
00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:52.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck happened but </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1292
00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:55.600
<v Speaker 2>because I think he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what am I basing that on?</v>

1293
00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:57.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1294
00:52:57.761 --> 00:53:02.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's in jail for a very innocuous</v>
<v Speaker 2>crime trying to get his own shit back </v>

1295
00:53:02.761 --> 00:53:05.590
<v Speaker 2>with a guy in the room that had a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy didn't even brandished the gun.</v>

1296
00:53:05.591 --> 00:53:08.350
<v Speaker 2>He tried to get his shit back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is stolen.</v>

1297
00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Memorable thing on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1298
00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.320
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made,</v>

1299
00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:16.410
<v Speaker 2>they fucked up by a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made some threat that then it made </v>

1300
00:53:16.601 --> 00:53:17.870
<v Speaker 2>it kidnapping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did,</v>

1301
00:53:17.871 --> 00:53:20.770
<v Speaker 2>they did all these little fucking things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he killed,</v>

1302
00:53:20.771 --> 00:53:22.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he killed two white people.</v>

1303
00:53:22.481 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 2>So that's the big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The white court's got him years later.</v>

1304
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:32.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really what mean it's complete </v>

1305
00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.251
<v Speaker 1>bullshit because the reality is if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't kill those fucking two people at </v>

1306
00:53:34.251 --> 00:53:34.320
<v Speaker 1>least where people didn't think that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed those fucking two people.</v>

1307
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.820
<v Speaker 1>If he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

1308
00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:41.920
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was Oj they and he was still on </v>

1309
00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.211
<v Speaker 1>fucking nfl today or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he probably would have been in and </v>

1310
00:53:44.211 --> 00:53:44.640
<v Speaker 1>out and that would have been it.</v>

1311
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:49.750
<v Speaker 2>He might not even done any time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might've like sided with him </v>

1312
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:50.150
<v Speaker 2>because these people were stealing his </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1313
00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:55.180
<v Speaker 2>He would have agreed to do was couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>signings at fucking Caesar's sides of </v>

1314
00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:56.490
<v Speaker 2>football helmets and it would have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>over seas.</v>

1315
00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:57.600
<v Speaker 2>It would have been over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>

1316
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:59.400
<v Speaker 2>Would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would have gone to the Venetian where</v>

1317
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:00.950
<v Speaker 2>they have a boat rides and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh Jay.</v>

1319
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:09.250
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird one though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's asking about anything.</v>

1320
00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:10.880
<v Speaker 2>He's just taking pictures and doing boat</v>
<v Speaker 2>rides.</v>

1321
00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:12.650
<v Speaker 2>No signing folks know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Signing.</v>

1322
00:54:12.651 --> 00:54:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Still take pictures though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't use your camera.</v>

1323
00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:18.180
<v Speaker 2>It'll be up online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caesar's dot com.</v>

1324
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll be it.</v>

1325
00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't touch them.</v>

1326
00:54:20.901 --> 00:54:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Just stand next to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird case,</v>

1327
00:54:23.151 --> 00:54:24.950
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's a case where we know that</v>

1328
00:54:24.951 --> 00:54:26.840
<v Speaker 2>that's not why he's in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're all happy.</v>

1329
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1330
00:54:30.281 --> 00:54:30.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1331
00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:31.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1332
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how I feel about all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking shit.</v>

1333
00:54:34.351 --> 00:54:35.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he got,</v>

1334
00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.120
<v Speaker 2>did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did it.</v>

1335
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:38.370
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a book about it.</v>

1336
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:41.640
<v Speaker 2>Remember that if I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to tell you or something.</v>

1337
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I did it was that this is how I would</v>

1338
00:54:45.691 --> 00:54:46.410
<v Speaker 2>do it now.</v>

1339
00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1340
00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.340
<v Speaker 2>Whatever happened to that book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That book never got published,</v>

1341
00:54:52.341 --> 00:54:53.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like no publisher wanted to.</v>

1342
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:58.060
<v Speaker 2>They originally had a publishing deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then is</v>

1343
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:59.640
<v Speaker 1>difference about all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I.</v>

1344
00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:04.910
<v Speaker 1>That rubs me the wrong way that he's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail is because all those fucking white </v>

1345
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:05.680
<v Speaker 1>dudes that did all that shit like blown </v>
<v Speaker 1>up churches with black people in it.</v>

1346
00:55:05.681 --> 00:55:10.681
<v Speaker 1>Like back in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would literally be sitting there </v>

1347
00:55:10.681 --> 00:55:12.421
<v Speaker 1>laughing during the trial and they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>get totally acquitted and then black </v>

1348
00:55:12.421 --> 00:55:14.230
<v Speaker 1>people weren't allowed to come along and</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that fucking four wheelers in their</v>

1349
00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:15.280
<v Speaker 1>hillbillies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1350
00:55:15.281 --> 00:55:17.500
<v Speaker 1>This stills afterwards in like a civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>court,</v>

1351
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.990
<v Speaker 1>they just completely got away with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it,</v>

1352
00:55:19.991 --> 00:55:22.600
<v Speaker 1>it still seems kind of fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for sale,</v>

1353
00:55:22.601 --> 00:55:24.420
<v Speaker 1>but they changed the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

1354
00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.830
<v Speaker 1>judge awarded the golden family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rights to the book.</v>

1355
00:55:26.831 --> 00:55:28.420
<v Speaker 1>So they get the publishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1356
00:55:28.421 --> 00:55:29.610
<v Speaker 1>so you can buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1357
00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:33.060
<v Speaker 1>So it says it's by Fred and Kim Goldman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but oh my God,</v>

1358
00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:35.500
<v Speaker 1>they didn't write it all and what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

1359
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took away if.</v>

1360
00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:37.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1361
00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:39.130
<v Speaker 1>they put the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

1362
00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:41.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget how I did it because I just saw</v>

1363
00:55:41.351 --> 00:55:44.620
<v Speaker 1>a thing on the F is written in red </v>
<v Speaker 1>letters inside the eye.</v>

1364
00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

1365
00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.370
<v Speaker 2>That right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1366
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:54.750
<v Speaker 2>And it's written blood red.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1367
00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1368
00:55:55.541 --> 00:55:57.060
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what cases are you talking about?</v>

1369
00:55:57.061 --> 00:55:58.080
<v Speaker 2>A guy's blowing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1370
00:55:58.110 --> 00:56:03.110
<v Speaker 2>obviously there were some horrendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>civil rights violations that took place </v>

1371
00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:04.020
<v Speaker 2>in the sixties and the fifties as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>

1372
00:56:04.021 --> 00:56:06.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all from slavery on from the 18,</v>

1373
00:56:06.811 --> 00:56:07.790
<v Speaker 2>60 [inaudible] just saying,</v>

1374
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:12.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the table gets turned and this </v>

1375
00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.590
<v Speaker 1>guy does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has the money to get off.</v>

1376
00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.810
<v Speaker 1>But then he still pays for it in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's why it just,</v>

1377
00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:18.210
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still doesn't seem,</v>

1378
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:20.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good because,</v>

1379
00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:21.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he killed two people,</v>

1380
00:56:21.661 --> 00:56:23.010
<v Speaker 1>so he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not out there,</v>

1381
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1382
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:25.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different crime though.</v>

1383
00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:30.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean what he did was a crime of </v>
<v Speaker 2>passion against an ex wife who happen to</v>

1384
00:56:30.161 --> 00:56:35.161
<v Speaker 2>be with some other guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those other crimes are in a lot of ways </v>

1385
00:56:35.161 --> 00:56:36.910
<v Speaker 2>more heinous because they're completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>race related.</v>

1386
00:56:36.911 --> 00:56:40.430
<v Speaker 2>If you go back to some of the lynchings </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of those horrific guys,</v>

1387
00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:41.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got.</v>

1388
00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.970
<v Speaker 2>They fucking took pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1389
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:45.730
<v Speaker 2>You ever see those photos are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scariest photos.</v>

1390
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Scalia's vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1391
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:51.600
<v Speaker 2>Kids smiling and they have evil and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have like evil and like the kids have </v>

1392
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:52.660
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

1393
00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:57.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patrice would show me those photos and </v>

1394
00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:57.680
<v Speaker 2>would point it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kid's going,</v>

1395
00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.200
<v Speaker 2>look at that girl bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

1396
00:56:59.201 --> 00:57:01.930
<v Speaker 2>probably 48 right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where the fuck is she?</v>

1397
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:04.780
<v Speaker 2>What does she do for a living?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>

1398
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:06.100
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

1399
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:07.810
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're out there.</v>

1400
00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1401
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1402
00:57:09.941 --> 00:57:13.060
<v Speaker 2>when you think about how many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have actually gotten arrested for murder</v>

1403
00:57:13.061 --> 00:57:16.480
<v Speaker 2>versus how many murders get just never </v>
<v Speaker 2>solved is,</v>

1404
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:21.500
<v Speaker 2>and it's a crazy number when everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks at those fucking TV shows about </v>

1405
00:57:21.941 --> 00:57:25.720
<v Speaker 2>cops and most crimes get solved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reality of murders,</v>

1406
00:57:25.721 --> 00:57:28.150
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like something like 70 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent go on,</v>

1407
00:57:28.151 --> 00:57:30.910
<v Speaker 2>solved something really nutty like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1408
00:57:30.911 --> 00:57:33.160
<v Speaker 2>I talked to a cop about that one time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I won't say it over the year.</v>

1409
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:38.220
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We won't say it over the air because </v>

1410
00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:38.220
<v Speaker 2>it's that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1411
00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:39.660
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to fucking murder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1412
00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Give people the green light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1413
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we tried to come up with the </v>

1414
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:46.680
<v Speaker 2>perfect murder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1415
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Me and this other guy to Rosa on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

1416
00:57:47.321 --> 00:57:50.770
<v Speaker 2>And then we had this cop listened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to our,</v>

1417
00:57:50.771 --> 00:57:52.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our plants.</v>

1418
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Mine was the funniest guys go.</v>

1419
00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:55.210
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So me and a buddy and he goes,</v>

1420
00:57:55.211 --> 00:57:56.020
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1421
00:57:56.021 --> 00:58:00.160
<v Speaker 2>you already cut what you involve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody else.</v>

1422
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:05.430
<v Speaker 2>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody's going to get scared and </v>

1423
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.430
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna.</v>

1424
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Cut a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1425
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:06.760
<v Speaker 2>it was fucking hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1426
00:58:06.761 --> 00:58:11.760
<v Speaker 2>I got like literally and I had worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing out in New Jersey.</v>

1427
00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:14.630
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to top each other to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>which one was better and I got like,</v>

1428
00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:18.580
<v Speaker 2>it's like when you watch American Ninja </v>
<v Speaker 2>Warrior and the person stumbles on those</v>

1429
00:58:18.581 --> 00:58:20.080
<v Speaker 2>first thing and it goes right into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

1430
00:58:20.081 --> 00:58:23.340
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he told us basically how to get out.</v>

1431
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.960
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1432
00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:28.980
<v Speaker 2>the audio does exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he basically said if you have no </v>

1433
00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:30.790
<v Speaker 2>priors and nobody fucking knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1434
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.960
<v Speaker 2>you've never done anything and if you,</v>

1435
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:39.510
<v Speaker 2>if you were to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody just completely not even </v>

1436
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.510
<v Speaker 2>connected to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1437
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:40.390
<v Speaker 2>That's a buddy of mine has said the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1438
00:58:40.391 --> 00:58:45.391
<v Speaker 2>Nobody saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's nothing like there's no </v>

1439
00:58:45.391 --> 00:58:45.391
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>

1440
00:58:45.391 --> 00:58:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Because there's no rational connection </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

1441
00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:51.840
<v Speaker 2>There's no trail to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard of this stuff that </v>

1442
00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.931
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're developing that's essentially </v>

1443
00:58:54.931 --> 00:58:57.510
<v Speaker 2>micro cameras with gps units that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the size smaller than a grain of rice,</v>

1444
00:58:57.790 --> 00:59:02.790
<v Speaker 2>like literally like sand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is that eventually they're </v>

1445
00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:06.991
<v Speaker 2>going to spread this shit everywhere and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be cameras that record </v>

1446
00:59:06.991 --> 00:59:09.820
<v Speaker 2>everything everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just a matter of time,</v>

1447
00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:13.060
<v Speaker 2>like now there's more cameras now today </v>
<v Speaker 2>than they've ever been before.</v>

1448
00:59:13.061 --> 00:59:18.061
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phones and surveillance cameras and </v>

1449
00:59:18.061 --> 00:59:18.061
<v Speaker 2>security cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one right now,</v>

1450
00:59:18.061 --> 00:59:22.690
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more cameras now than ever been </v>

1451
00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:24.931
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's nothing compared to what they </v>

1452
00:59:24.931 --> 00:59:26.621
<v Speaker 2>have potentially lined up for the future</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're going to have like grains </v>

1453
00:59:26.621 --> 00:59:27.290
<v Speaker 2>of sand cameras everywhere.</v>

1454
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:30.650
<v Speaker 2>You just vacuum your house to scoop them</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1455
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about out there in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

1456
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:35.930
<v Speaker 2>They don't give a shit and it's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>show me jerking off.</v>

1457
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:40.150
<v Speaker 2>You don't to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I at least have that target?</v>

1458
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Will there ever be a time where there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no privacy?</v>

1459
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:48.970
<v Speaker 2>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will there be a time with the zero </v>

1460
00:59:48.970 --> 00:59:48.970
<v Speaker 2>privacy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1461
00:59:48.970 --> 00:59:48.970
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing.</v>

1462
00:59:48.970 --> 00:59:53.081
<v Speaker 2>The reason why they're going to get away</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it is because people have such </v>

1463
00:59:53.081 --> 00:59:54.170
<v Speaker 2>fucking voyeurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the more private it is,</v>

1464
00:59:54.171 --> 00:59:56.420
<v Speaker 2>the less I want to see it because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>always think like,</v>

1465
00:59:56.421 --> 00:59:58.040
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want someone to do that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1466
00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anytime there's like a,</v>

1467
01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even think of an example.</v>

1468
01:00:02.691 --> 01:00:07.691
<v Speaker 2>But there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just been some micro celebrity </v>

1469
01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:07.691
<v Speaker 2>photos that got leaked where they got </v>
<v Speaker 2>into their icloud.</v>

1470
01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:08.450
<v Speaker 2>They like naked photos of.</v>

1471
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:10.880
<v Speaker 2>I never look at those fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really.</v>

1472
01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:11.870
<v Speaker 2>If somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1473
01:00:11.871 --> 01:00:13.880
<v Speaker 2>intercepts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a cell phone call,</v>

1474
01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't listen to those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1475
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:17.060
<v Speaker 2>I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1476
01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.670
<v Speaker 2>your moral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it feels gross.</v>

1477
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:20.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1478
01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for you.</v>

1479
01:00:20.721 --> 01:00:22.130
<v Speaker 2>You're moral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more a person.</v>

1480
01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:23.090
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1481
01:00:23.091 --> 01:00:23.910
<v Speaker 2>And it may not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1482
01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:24.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1483
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:26.450
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say I'm a moral person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but had just in that,</v>

1484
01:00:26.451 --> 01:00:27.830
<v Speaker 2>in that instant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I am.</v>

1485
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:32.390
<v Speaker 2>You're definitely moral moral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't put me on that pedestal.</v>

1486
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.200
<v Speaker 2>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1487
01:00:33.201 --> 01:00:34.700
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not ridiculous.</v>

1488
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:39.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're just a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you have morals?</v>

1489
01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:44.320
<v Speaker 2>You gotta get slightly annoyed and a gas</v>
<v Speaker 2>station and for the rest of the day you </v>

1490
01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.290
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a lot of work,</v>

1491
01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.850
<v Speaker 2>lot of work ahead of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should get a punching bag.</v>

1492
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:51.870
<v Speaker 2>I have a speed bag.</v>

1493
01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:57.100
<v Speaker 2>That's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it is now because speed bags </v>

1494
01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.980
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not rich is no real system exists.</v>

1495
01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.790
<v Speaker 2>And I hit it and I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I blew a bet you do.</v>

1496
01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:06.380
<v Speaker 2>And it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do enjoy it.</v>

1497
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.350
<v Speaker 2>And then I go and I play some drums and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy that.</v>

1498
01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not degrading it,</v>

1499
01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.540
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying it's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were very judgmental.</v>

1500
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.580
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you certain things.</v>

1501
01:01:16.581 --> 01:01:21.581
<v Speaker 2>I jumped in that I can hold in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful hands of mine told me it </v>

1502
01:01:21.581 --> 01:01:24.740
<v Speaker 2>wasn't real because people are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

1503
01:01:24.741 --> 01:01:27.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird position to hold your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seen hidden figures.</v>

1504
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:29.360
<v Speaker 2>The habit I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

1505
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:34.390
<v Speaker 2>The women got us on the real break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speed bags versus heavy bags down in a </v>

1506
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:35.840
<v Speaker 2>way that you've never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've never heard.</v>

1507
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:37.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's beautiful.</v>

1508
01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:45.830
<v Speaker 2>No heavy bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Won't even sit there and fuck up my </v>

1509
01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:47.951
<v Speaker 2>hands and fuck up your hands for this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because my technique will be fucked up </v>

1510
01:01:47.951 --> 01:01:51.101
<v Speaker 2>because I don't have the time Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to the Dojo like you have for 30 </v>

1511
01:01:51.101 --> 01:01:55.061
<v Speaker 2>fucking years and get it down and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go in there and I'm going to </v>

1512
01:01:55.061 --> 01:01:56.090
<v Speaker 2>fuck up my wrist and I'll hit it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrong.</v>

1513
01:01:56.110 --> 01:01:56.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1514
01:01:56.481 --> 01:02:01.481
<v Speaker 2>once you get a water bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your hands get a water bag.</v>

1515
01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:06.650
<v Speaker 2>Water bags are like literally like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're punching into water.</v>

1516
01:02:06.651 --> 01:02:07.850
<v Speaker 2>It's heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in a desert,</v>

1517
01:02:07.851 --> 01:02:09.250
<v Speaker 2>but it just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gosh,</v>

1518
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:11.870
<v Speaker 2>same water will be there forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's raining now.</v>

1519
01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Kept plenty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1520
01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:15.500
<v Speaker 2>They said the drought is over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like,</v>

1521
01:02:15.501 --> 01:02:17.240
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have enough water right now.</v>

1522
01:02:17.241 --> 01:02:18.660
<v Speaker 2>This now has to last us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>

1523
01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Who the knows when it's going</v>

1524
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.350
<v Speaker 1>to rain again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody like the mayor is some shit.</v>

1525
01:02:22.351 --> 01:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Said that out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but drive is now officially over now.</v>

1526
01:02:24.961 --> 01:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Reduce bag out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's taken an extra long shower,</v>

1527
01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>will listen to ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never stopped modern.</v>

1528
01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Those fucking golf courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The golf course.</v>

1529
01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:33.420
<v Speaker 1>This is a huge problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they they.</v>

1530
01:02:33.421 --> 01:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stay.</v>

1531
01:02:34.201 --> 01:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Stop watering the median strip on sunset</v>
<v Speaker 1>and beverly hills.</v>

1532
01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:40.770
<v Speaker 1>That was unsettling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1533
01:02:40.771 --> 01:02:42.460
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They let enrich people's grass.</v>

1534
01:02:42.461 --> 01:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Go fucking Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is scary.</v>

1535
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>This is getting real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1536
01:02:46.231 --> 01:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>they had rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1537
01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:52.221
<v Speaker 1>Like you were only supposed to water </v>
<v Speaker 1>your thing at night and you can only </v>

1538
01:02:52.221 --> 01:02:52.221
<v Speaker 1>water at a certain amount of times a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1539
01:02:52.221 --> 01:02:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Like when it comes to your lawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have those rules with </v>

1540
01:02:57.110 --> 01:02:57.110
<v Speaker 1>golf courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they golf courses?</v>

1541
01:02:57.110 --> 01:03:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Like especially private ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they spend millions and millions of </v>

1542
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>gallons of water every year just in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1543
01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you golf?</v>

1544
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:06.540
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

1545
01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking mind.</v>

1546
01:03:09.511 --> 01:03:14.511
<v Speaker 1>Numbingly boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get into a sport where there's </v>

1547
01:03:14.511 --> 01:03:16.590
<v Speaker 1>nobody trying to stop me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you need to get yourself,</v>

1548
01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to forgive myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get them the next toll.</v>

1549
01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking um,</v>

1550
01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:26.930
<v Speaker 1>I respect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1551
01:03:26.931 --> 01:03:27.510
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1552
01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the,</v>

1553
01:03:29.351 --> 01:03:31.830
<v Speaker 1>the people that are the best at it are </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletic,</v>

1554
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:35.160
<v Speaker 1>but I have seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that I've seen do that,</v>

1555
01:03:35.161 --> 01:03:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you if you throw a ball at </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1556
01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:42.590
<v Speaker 1>they would tense up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't have any athletic </v>

1557
01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:45.200
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will get on a golf course and they </v>

1558
01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:45.200
<v Speaker 1>can keep it on the course and they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot,</v>

1559
01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can break 100.</v>

1560
01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:47.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1561
01:03:47.971 --> 01:03:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1562
01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

1563
01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:51.660
<v Speaker 1>In the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fucking pageantry of it,</v>

1564
01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:56.661
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking clothes and the bags that </v>

1565
01:03:56.661 --> 01:04:00.440
<v Speaker 1>either is that don't think there's ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a fucking sport because there's so </v>

1566
01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.610
<v Speaker 1>many fat fuck non non athletic people </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing it.</v>

1567
01:04:02.611 --> 01:04:04.740
<v Speaker 1>There has never been a sport that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjusted.</v>

1568
01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:06.420
<v Speaker 1>The equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ball,</v>

1569
01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:11.660
<v Speaker 1>the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clubs that you use to give you more </v>

1570
01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.991
<v Speaker 1>distance to help you hit it straighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like literally the only thing </v>

1571
01:04:14.991 --> 01:04:15.120
<v Speaker 1>missing on a fucking driver now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>training wheels.</v>

1572
01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.590
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should just have it,</v>

1573
01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:20.010
<v Speaker 1>guide you back and then come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come right through us.</v>

1574
01:04:20.011 --> 01:04:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Truly baseball never went to aluminum </v>
<v Speaker 1>bats.</v>

1575
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.120
<v Speaker 1>If they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they looked at the college level.</v>

1576
01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:25.800
<v Speaker 1>But at the pro level they just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>

1577
01:04:25.801 --> 01:04:27.750
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do this.</v>

1578
01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they but they.</v>

1579
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:31.440
<v Speaker 1>But baseball when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were going through,</v>

1580
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:36.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one was watching it and it wasn't </v>

1581
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.470
<v Speaker 1>exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1582
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.470
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1583
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:38.250
<v Speaker 1>they made the stadium smaller that </v>
<v Speaker 1>juiced up the ball.</v>

1584
01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:40.590
<v Speaker 1>People on Roids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look the other way like,</v>

1585
01:04:40.591 --> 01:04:42.210
<v Speaker 1>well Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

1586
01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:48.410
<v Speaker 1>And they just had these King Kong guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>going up there and just smashing them </v>

1587
01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:50.460
<v Speaker 1>over the fence and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm just saying like,</v>

1588
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:55.490
<v Speaker 1>like I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like when guys got busted for Cork in </v>

1589
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:57.951
<v Speaker 1>the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was the most ridiculous </v>

1590
01:04:57.951 --> 01:04:58.380
<v Speaker 1>thing to get in trouble for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put a cork inside the bat.</v>

1591
01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Bats would break what's in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was always.</v>

1592
01:05:02.911 --> 01:05:03.510
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1593
01:05:03.511 --> 01:05:04.860
<v Speaker 1>that's another one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't watch.</v>

1594
01:05:04.861 --> 01:05:09.861
<v Speaker 1>That's just so embarrassing to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick it up and just cover up the cork.</v>

1595
01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Well this is what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're going to do that like the</v>

1596
01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 1>entire time you're a pro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should.</v>

1597
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:19.870
<v Speaker 1>The bad boys should never have to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your shit.</v>

1598
01:05:19.871 --> 01:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>You always get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

1599
01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Sunny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got into like,</v>

1600
01:05:21.701 --> 01:05:22.030
<v Speaker 1>look at me.</v>

1601
01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:27.030
<v Speaker 1>So down to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then when you finally get bust with </v>

1602
01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:27.030
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corked bat,</v>

1603
01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:27.030
<v Speaker 1>when you go to pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to look at you weird.</v>

1604
01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:27.910
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1605
01:05:27.911 --> 01:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these majorly baseball guys,</v>

1606
01:05:29.981 --> 01:05:34.981
<v Speaker 1>they just fucking dropped the bat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some little eight year old scurries out </v>

1607
01:05:34.981 --> 01:05:36.520
<v Speaker 1>and picks it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the second that you give a fuck about</v>

1608
01:05:36.521 --> 01:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>that little eight year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1609
01:05:37.451 --> 01:05:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I think you've run enough there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sonny boy,</v>

1610
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:40.810
<v Speaker 1>like I think they realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1611
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.050
<v Speaker 1>that's on the outcomes over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see the cork,</v>

1612
01:05:44.051 --> 01:05:48.560
<v Speaker 1>right when it snaps out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

1613
01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:50.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average sports fan,</v>

1614
01:05:50.810 --> 01:05:51.670
<v Speaker 1>we be to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1615
01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:54.460
<v Speaker 1>I said that a month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of the fucking bat breaks.</v>

1616
01:05:54.461 --> 01:05:59.461
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not until they pick it up and they </v>

1617
01:05:59.461 --> 01:06:01.381
<v Speaker 1>start looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the announcer literally tells </v>

1618
01:06:01.381 --> 01:06:01.381
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1619
01:06:01.381 --> 01:06:03.520
<v Speaker 1>they're inspecting his bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This could possibly be a court situation</v>

1620
01:06:03.521 --> 01:06:04.300
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I know.</v>

1621
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.720
<v Speaker 1>How much of a difference does it make to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have cork in the bat?</v>

1622
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:11.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a competitive edge.</v>

1623
01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:13.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have to have the barrel of the</v>

1624
01:06:13.331 --> 01:06:15.430
<v Speaker 1>bat meet the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so fucking hard.</v>

1625
01:06:15.431 --> 01:06:20.431
<v Speaker 1>You still have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it could be the difference between </v>

1626
01:06:20.431 --> 01:06:20.431
<v Speaker 1>going and getting to the warning track</v>

1627
01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:26.370
<v Speaker 1>and going over and just hitting the wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>and getting into a double or something.</v>

1628
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:27.850
<v Speaker 1>That's the only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1629
01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:32.851
<v Speaker 1>Just that little amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just gives it just a little little </v>

1630
01:06:32.851 --> 01:06:33.940
<v Speaker 1>little push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Shit.</v>

1631
01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Sammy socials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Downfall began 13 years ago.</v>

1632
01:06:37.061 --> 01:06:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Sammy Sosa got busted with Cork.</v>

1633
01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:45.270
<v Speaker 1>So what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They drill a hole in the bat and then </v>

1634
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:46.540
<v Speaker 1>just hollow it out somehow or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck's going on in that one?</v>

1635
01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:48.840
<v Speaker 1>That picture you just showed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

1636
01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:51.840
<v Speaker 1>That might've been the one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They picked it up off the ground.</v>

1637
01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:55.380
<v Speaker 1>They're cutting grass or some show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't know.</v>

1638
01:06:55.381 --> 01:06:56.420
<v Speaker 1>I thought there was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1639
01:06:56.421 --> 01:06:59.130
<v Speaker 1>they drilled a hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to follow this down.</v>

1640
01:06:59.131 --> 01:06:59.700
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1641
01:06:59.701 --> 01:07:02.430
<v Speaker 1>if a court has been courted transfers </v>
<v Speaker 1>less energy to the ball,</v>

1642
01:07:02.431 --> 01:07:06.480
<v Speaker 1>which makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But transfer is less energy to the ball.</v>

1643
01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.680
<v Speaker 7>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1644
01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Well that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1645
01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:13.340
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I have no physics.</v>

1646
01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Well why don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1647
01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:19.640
<v Speaker 1>well it seems to me that it makes more </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that if a bat was solid,</v>

1648
01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.040
<v Speaker 1>that does make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You give them that with solid,</v>

1649
01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:27.050
<v Speaker 1>more massive a transformer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you would be able to swing it </v>

1650
01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:29.981
<v Speaker 1>faster if it was lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you thought it was because it was </v>

1651
01:07:29.981 --> 01:07:30.160
<v Speaker 1>more of a spongy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1652
01:07:30.161 --> 01:07:31.340
<v Speaker 1>that's what I thought too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1653
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:33.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's right because I think they </v>
<v Speaker 1>drove from the top.</v>

1654
01:07:33.501 --> 01:07:38.501
<v Speaker 1>Thank God you said that because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a bunch of people screaming </v>

1655
01:07:38.501 --> 01:07:39.020
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking you fucking moron.</v>

1656
01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:40.220
<v Speaker 1>It's lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Cut.</v>

1657
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

1658
01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:44.750
<v Speaker 1>We start like they had it like up </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the,</v>

1659
01:07:44.751 --> 01:07:46.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like flush with it.</v>

1660
01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

1661
01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.970
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that.</v>

1662
01:07:49.971 --> 01:07:52.520
<v Speaker 1>That's like having a nerf bad up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking bat would break.</v>

1663
01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.750
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I guess it does bounce more boring</v>

1664
01:07:57.370 --> 01:08:02.370
<v Speaker 1>for your listeners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the record I said I had no physics </v>

1665
01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:02.370
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so definitely don't know.</v>

1666
01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1667
01:08:02.811 --> 01:08:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I would think that it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would hit harder.</v>

1668
01:08:04.851 --> 01:08:09.851
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so it's just a matter of it </v>

1669
01:08:09.851 --> 01:08:10.130
<v Speaker 1>being faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed coming through.</v>

1670
01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is why they switched it.</v>

1671
01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:14.390
<v Speaker 1>When they're warming up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they swing all those other bats.</v>

1672
01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 1>They swing two right</v>

1673
01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:21.540
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One would they put a weight on the bat </v>

1674
01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:21.540
<v Speaker 2>and I swing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1675
01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which actually helps.</v>

1676
01:08:21.651 --> 01:08:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Some people say it helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people say it doesn't help.</v>

1677
01:08:23.781 --> 01:08:28.781
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you guys do that and yet you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys like run with like weighted vests </v>

1678
01:08:28.781 --> 01:08:28.800
<v Speaker 2>on through the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1679
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:34.090
<v Speaker 2>it's bad for your joints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some guys do it the best way to do </v>

1680
01:08:34.090 --> 01:08:34.310
<v Speaker 2>it as hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hiking with weighted vest is okay,</v>

1681
01:08:34.311 --> 01:08:37.010
<v Speaker 2>but running really not such a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially.</v>

1682
01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:39.580
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of guys that do it though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll put a weighted vest on.</v>

1683
01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:43.490
<v Speaker 2>They run on concrete hard assets and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Tito Ortiz fight.</v>

1684
01:08:43.491 --> 01:08:44.990
<v Speaker 2>I saw Tito won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He Won.</v>

1685
01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:47.300
<v Speaker 2>He choked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was quick fight.</v>

1686
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:50.450
<v Speaker 2>He got caught in a good team early in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight,</v>

1687
01:08:50.451 --> 01:08:52.730
<v Speaker 2>but child lost the guillotine and Tito </v>
<v Speaker 2>gun on top.</v>

1688
01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Tito took us back and he got like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like sort of a rear naked choke,</v>

1689
01:08:57.201 --> 01:08:58.610
<v Speaker 2>but more of like a face crush.</v>

1690
01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.140
<v Speaker 2>He just Tito's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a gorilla.</v>

1691
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Just kinda get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people thought it was a work.</v>

1692
01:09:02.151 --> 01:09:07.151
<v Speaker 2>They thought it was fake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was a fake fight because he did </v>

1693
01:09:07.151 --> 01:09:07.151
<v Speaker 2>it so easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1694
01:09:07.151 --> 01:09:09.020
<v Speaker 2>it looked fake because the choke wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>in right,</v>

1695
01:09:09.021 --> 01:09:10.810
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just kinda he.</v>

1696
01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:13.190
<v Speaker 2>He did what we call Gundam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You goons,</v>

1697
01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:18.191
<v Speaker 2>somebody like there's some times like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just get someone's head and </v>

1698
01:09:18.191 --> 01:09:20.120
<v Speaker 2>just crush it and you're goon them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the right technique to do that,</v>

1699
01:09:20.121 --> 01:09:22.820
<v Speaker 2>to make the right technique is you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the chin,</v>

1700
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:28.030
<v Speaker 2>you wrap your head around the back of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the neck and that way that he can just </v>

1701
01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:28.910
<v Speaker 2>get maximum leverage and it's perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique,</v>

1702
01:09:28.911 --> 01:09:31.850
<v Speaker 2>but he just seemed lower jaw to the back</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his head.</v>

1703
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:35.420
<v Speaker 2>If someone's eye socket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like right there and I get their head</v>

1704
01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:40.600
<v Speaker 2>and I'm fresh early in the fight because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not even tired and you get </v>

1705
01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:40.670
<v Speaker 2>fucking crush their head.</v>

1706
01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:45.670
<v Speaker 2>You can goon somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of guys have been gooned </v>

1707
01:09:45.670 --> 01:09:45.670
<v Speaker 2>you know that word dude?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1708
01:09:45.670 --> 01:09:50.590
<v Speaker 2>Gooning Jujitsu word like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are certain techniques you do </v>

1709
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:50.590
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1710
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:54.290
<v Speaker 2>it's funny is it just totally defines </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the second one says.</v>

1711
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:59.310
<v Speaker 2>I know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just had no respect for my style </v>

1712
01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:02.441
<v Speaker 2>walkthrough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All my pussy kicks and hits and just </v>

1713
01:10:02.441 --> 01:10:02.441
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1714
01:10:02.441 --> 01:10:02.500
<v Speaker 2>grabbed my nostril right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It right it.</v>

1715
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1716
01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.280
<v Speaker 2>what do you watch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Game of thrones?</v>

1717
01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped.</v>

1718
01:10:05.991 --> 01:10:08.690
<v Speaker 2>My wife would just would refuse to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

1719
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:10.520
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1720
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember the mountain?</v>

1721
01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want them out and grab that </v>

1722

<v Speaker 2>head with his hands.</v>

1745
01:11:16.150 --> 01:11:19.380
<v Speaker 2>And some of the death is more terrifying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to people than just shooting them from a</v>

1746
01:11:19.381 --> 01:11:21.330
<v Speaker 2>distance as a sniper.</v>

<v Speaker 2>just fucking out.</v>

1753
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I just got to get information out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1754
01:11:43.481 --> 01:11:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Bill Burr,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Some people out there that know things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to find out what they know </v>

1756
01:11:49.121 --> 01:11:52.171
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best way to do it is to cut their </v>

1757
01:11:52.171 --> 01:11:52.171
<v Speaker 2>fingers off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1758
01:11:52.171 --> 01:11:52.171
<v Speaker 2>haven't they proved that when you start </v>
<v Speaker 2>to cut,</v>

1759
01:11:52.171 --> 01:11:53.470
<v Speaker 2>just to tell someone to cut your finger </v>
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

1760
01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.360
<v Speaker 2>they will tell you whatever the fuck you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1762
01:11:56.471 --> 01:12:01.471
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes sometimes they won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they'll tell you some fake </v>

1763
01:12:01.471 --> 01:12:03.970
<v Speaker 2>shit and like how many do you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting the real stuff?</v>

1764
01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Probably nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably nine.</v>

1765
01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.970
<v Speaker 2>And they think about that last thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they need to open up their iphone.</v>

1766
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:15.030
<v Speaker 2>Like alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just open to the refrigerator </v>

1767
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:19.531

<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can you do?</v>

1769
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1770
01:12:20.671 --> 01:12:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1771
01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>W W,</v>

1772
01:12:24.730 --> 01:12:26.800
<v Speaker 2>w what are war crimes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

1773
01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:27.760
<v Speaker 2>How about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1774
01:12:27.761 --> 01:12:30.100
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to do certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of gas people,</v>

1775
01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:31.810
<v Speaker 2>but you're allowed to drop a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb on them.</v>

1776
01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.120
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1777
01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:36.280
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't be an issue like war at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this point.</v>

1778
01:12:36.281 --> 01:12:38.770
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>War should be illegal.</v>

1779
01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:41.540
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do when someone attacks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just take them?</v>

1780
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:42.060
<v Speaker 2>They've shown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1781
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:47.070
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that we should be </v>

1782
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:47.680
<v Speaker 2>progressed in that we should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1783
01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:49.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised as the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in people,</v>

1784
01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:50.530
<v Speaker 2>common people,</v>

1785
01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:51.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>

1786
01:12:51.091 --> 01:12:53.440
<v Speaker 1>We're not exactly civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1787
01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:57.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody's going to war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a civil fucking thought.</v>

1788
01:12:59.790 --> 01:13:04.790
<v Speaker 1>It would be great if everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you need regular people to do </v>

1789
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.790
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if everybody was just like,</v>

1790
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:05.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not doing it.</v>

1791
01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you guys want to go to war,</v>

1792
01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.730
<v Speaker 1>you guys go fight each other to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll fucking watch it on page.</v>

1793
01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:15.770
<v Speaker 1>That would be the ultimate but note.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a complete lack of trust </v>

1794
01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:15.770
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1795
01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different countries,</v>

1796
01:13:17.701 --> 01:13:19.530
<v Speaker 1>different cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different races and all that.</v>

1797
01:13:19.531 --> 01:13:23.070
<v Speaker 1>But if you could somehow get everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the same page to be just like,</v>

1798
01:13:23.071 --> 01:13:23.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1799
01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:25.050
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not doing that anymore.</v>

1800
01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:30.030
<v Speaker 1>So you guys find out a different way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking take over the world is something</v>

1801
01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:30.810
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1802
01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:31.830
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1803
01:13:31.831 --> 01:13:33.140
<v Speaker 1>that could never happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get ketamine,</v>

1804
01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't,</v>

1805
01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:38.040
<v Speaker 1>couldn't have watched the apprentice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watched him to try to get a,</v>

1806
01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:39.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1807
01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Vince Neil and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture club guy,</v>

1808
01:13:41.791 --> 01:13:46.791
<v Speaker 1>they can't even get on the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrity apprentice and they want you </v>

1809
01:13:46.791 --> 01:13:48.000
<v Speaker 1>to think they can't get on the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking page to write a song.</v>

1810
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.800
<v Speaker 1>So there's no way you're ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>end war right there.</v>

1811
01:13:49.810 --> 01:13:54.810
<v Speaker 2>They asked me to do that show celebrity </v>
<v Speaker 2>apprentice back when fear factor came </v>

1812
01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:55.780
<v Speaker 2>back years ago and I was thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

1813
01:13:55.781 --> 01:14:00.781
<v Speaker 2>And I'm so glad I didn't do it now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because would have like me and trump </v>

1814
01:14:00.781 --> 01:14:01.690
<v Speaker 2>didn't get along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What have you thought it was a cunt.</v>

1815
01:14:02.050 --> 01:14:03.520
<v Speaker 2>And now I became president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1816
01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:09.010
<v Speaker 2>fucking enemies with the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that.</v>

1817
01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Like Rosie O'donnell right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she probably barely</v>

1818
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.980
<v Speaker 5>leaves her house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's probably just sitting at home </v>

1819
01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:16.980
<v Speaker 5>going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck,</v>

1820
01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:16.980
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

1821
01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:21.790
<v Speaker 5>you get audited or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She used to shit on them constantly and </v>

1822
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:22.300
<v Speaker 5>then he started shitting on her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would go to war with each other.</v>

1823
01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:25.750
<v Speaker 5>She was on the view and she would shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>on him and make fun of his hair and make</v>

1824
01:14:25.751 --> 01:14:30.130
<v Speaker 5>fun of him and make fun of his life and </v>
<v Speaker 5>his family and right.</v>

1825
01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:35.340
<v Speaker 5>And then he became fucking president and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then in the debates he was mocking her </v>

1826
01:14:35.381 --> 01:14:38.740
<v Speaker 5>and the debates like she was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because Clinton said something about the</v>

1827
01:14:38.741 --> 01:14:43.741
<v Speaker 5>things that he says about women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I always have a real fucking </v>

1828
01:14:43.741 --> 01:14:43.741
<v Speaker 5>problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1829
01:14:43.741 --> 01:14:43.741
<v Speaker 5>because she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1830
01:14:43.741 --> 01:14:46.090
<v Speaker 5>you've called women this and you've </v>
<v Speaker 5>called women that like,</v>

1831
01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:51.450
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's called people that and some of </v>

1832
01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:54.151
<v Speaker 5>those people happen to be women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's also called men that and they know </v>

1833
01:14:54.151 --> 01:14:54.151
<v Speaker 5>that's one.</v>

1834
01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:57.040
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that he said when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said she's a nasty woman,</v>

1835
01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:58.390
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They latched on,</v>

1836
01:14:58.391 --> 01:15:03.391
<v Speaker 1>like he was attacking him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's a nasty man or he's not a good man </v>

1838
01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:06.520
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1840
01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:09.880
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We became this thing where women like,</v>

1841
01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:13.100
<v Speaker 5>you're not supposed to have mock women </v>
<v Speaker 5>make fun of women.</v>

1842
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:16.490
<v Speaker 5>Like are we equal or are we not?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if we're equal,</v>

1843
01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:19.340
<v Speaker 5>I should be able to shit on you the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>I should on everybody.</v>

1845
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:20.570
<v Speaker 1>your character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1847
01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:27.040
<v Speaker 1>future is feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

1848
01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:29.860
<v Speaker 1>It was just this thing that these women </v>
<v Speaker 1>were wearing it.</v>

1849
01:15:29.861 --> 01:15:34.861
<v Speaker 1>When I went down to go vote and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you are so fucking you making </v>

<v Speaker 1>because it should be.</v>

1851
01:15:37.961 --> 01:15:41.050
<v Speaker 1>The future is like some sort of unity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what you're doing is like,</v>

1852
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future is we're going to fucking now</v>

<v Speaker 1>do to you what we've been complaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>about work it's going to be so then </v>

1854
01:15:47.761 --> 01:15:51.240

<v Speaker 1>Then you lose any sort of feeling of </v>

1855
01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:51.250
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>He was like maybe the only guy ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>running for president that wasn't </v>

1891
01:17:09.831 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 5>completely tied the financial system.</v>

1892
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.690
<v Speaker 1>They can always find shit on you be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They didn't vote for this and they </v>

1896
01:17:18.941 --> 01:17:18.941
<v Speaker 1>didn't vote for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like,</v>

1897
01:17:18.941 --> 01:17:18.941
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was fucking attached to it?</v>

1898
01:17:18.941 --> 01:17:20.900
<v Speaker 1>And I don't get why that's legal where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1899
01:17:20.901 --> 01:17:25.901
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1901
01:17:25.901 --> 01:17:28.600
<v Speaker 1>And then you see like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is attached to it is like,</v>

1902
01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:33.640
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to start fracking next to </v>

<v Speaker 1>a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly hospital or whatever </v>

1904
01:17:35.321 --> 01:17:35.321
<v Speaker 1>that I don't know.</v>

1905
01:17:35.321 --> 01:17:38.970
<v Speaker 5>The CNN Fox divide the left and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>right device never been greater in this </v>

1906
01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:40.510
<v Speaker 5>country than right now there is no one </v>
<v Speaker 5>objective.</v>

1907
01:17:40.511 --> 01:17:45.511
<v Speaker 5>News source does not one source.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just tells you what's going on and </v>

1908
01:17:45.511 --> 01:17:45.511
<v Speaker 5>doesn't do it.</v>

1909
01:17:45.511 --> 01:17:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Biased perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I like to write.</v>

1910
01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:51.960
<v Speaker 1>But I think that divide only exists </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the people that watched that </v>

1911
01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.340
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda like people like do you watch</v>

1912
01:17:53.341 --> 01:17:54.960
<v Speaker 1>the UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you not watch UFC?</v>

1913
01:17:54.961 --> 01:17:56.880
<v Speaker 1>If you watch UFC you're fucking into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1914
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's just news junkies </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there that just mainline that shit </v>

1915
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.220
<v Speaker 1>and they're the ones that where that </v>
<v Speaker 1>divide is like that.</v>

1916
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:07.670
<v Speaker 1>But someone like myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

1917
01:18:07.671 --> 01:18:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can listen to somebody.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I try to listen to it because I try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep that shit out of my head because a,</v>

1920
01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:21.100
<v Speaker 1>it gives me anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't fucking watch it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>just kept putting these obstacles in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking anxiety.</v>

<v Speaker 5>they definitely do.</v>

1950
01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:37.640
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're working it out.</v>

1951
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:39.680
<v Speaker 5>I think we're working it out as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization.</v>

1952
01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:41.790
<v Speaker 5>That's what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Had a little bit of faith.</v>

1953
01:19:41.850 --> 01:19:44.090
<v Speaker 5>You came in with the cameras and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>grains of sand.</v>

1954
01:19:44.450 --> 01:19:45.790
<v Speaker 5>That's the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna.</v>

1955
01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:47.500
<v Speaker 5>Take some time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's gonna.</v>

1956
01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:50.210
<v Speaker 5>Take about 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to buy a fucking leaf blower.</v>

1957
01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Just walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking walking down the street</v>

1958
01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.370
<v Speaker 5>blowing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But meanwhile they'll have video footage</v>

1959
01:19:57.371 --> 01:19:59.650
<v Speaker 5>of you because you won't be able to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the grains.</v>

1960
01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:02.920
<v Speaker 5>That'd be everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The literally be covering the surface of</v>

1961
01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:04.270
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of this planet,</v>

1962
01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.650
<v Speaker 5>like dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Little,</v>

1963
01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 5>little tiny cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got To be a thing that</v>

1964
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:09.850
<v Speaker 2>I always thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I.</v>

1965
01:20:09.851 --> 01:20:11.910
<v Speaker 2>I read about this because I'm always </v>
<v Speaker 2>late night,</v>

1966
01:20:11.911 --> 01:20:16.911
<v Speaker 2>I fucking go on the Internet and as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall asleep so I can't remember if this </v>

1967
01:20:16.911 --> 01:20:17.340
<v Speaker 2>is my idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody came up with it would be really</v>

1968
01:20:17.341 --> 01:20:22.341
<v Speaker 2>cool for like say if you're like at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>level of celebrity where everybody's </v>

1969
01:20:22.710 --> 01:20:27.710
<v Speaker 2>always taken a picture of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could wear his suit that </v>

1970
01:20:27.710 --> 01:20:31.641
<v Speaker 2>anticipated the camera flash and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>their cameras flashed you would flash </v>

1971
01:20:31.641 --> 01:20:35.331
<v Speaker 2>back at them and then they couldn't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything and then he could just sit </v>

1972
01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:36.510
<v Speaker 2>there eating your soup is everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken pictures of you and they would all</v>

1973
01:20:36.511 --> 01:20:38.700
<v Speaker 2>go back to the developing Rome or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck they do.</v>

1974
01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:41.010
<v Speaker 2>Look into their cameras and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what was going on.</v>

1975
01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Would just be like a Ufo landed in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

1976
01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There has to be a way like I like.</v>

1977
01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:49.530
<v Speaker 2>I feel like future money is encountering</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

1978
01:20:49.770 --> 01:20:54.770
<v Speaker 2>There it is antipop Razzi close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a blazer and I knew that I was too </v>

1979
01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:56.940
<v Speaker 2>stupid to come up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does he not captured?</v>

1980
01:20:57.310 --> 01:21:02.310
<v Speaker 2>How does three m reflection stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>on like a lot of shoes and some other </v>

1981
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.670
<v Speaker 2>claw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never turn the flash off though.</v>

1982
01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Then it's dark and you can't see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1983
01:21:04.771 --> 01:21:06.570
<v Speaker 2>which is the opposite reason I've taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck.</v>

1984
01:21:06.571 --> 01:21:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1985
01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:09.840
<v Speaker 2>I'll show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get a better photo.</v>

1986
01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:13.350
<v Speaker 2>This was just an article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's some of the folks I knew.</v>

1987
01:21:13.351 --> 01:21:18.351
<v Speaker 2>I was too dumb to come up with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're wearing hoods that stopped </v>

1988
01:21:18.351 --> 01:21:22.921
<v Speaker 2>like oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see their face or anything and just see </v>

1989
01:21:22.921 --> 01:21:23.700
<v Speaker 2>the clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not really what the reason they</v>

1990
01:21:23.701 --> 01:21:27.420
<v Speaker 2>want to take your photo that I mean it </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

1991
01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:32.450
<v Speaker 2>You can see what guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There might be a reason way to get </v>

1992
01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:33.380
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for now that's new.</v>

1993
01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Those new cameras that they have now are</v>
<v Speaker 2>so good on camera.</v>

1994
01:21:37.891 --> 01:21:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Phones are so good in low light that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even need that anymore.</v>

1995
01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:47.320
<v Speaker 2>You just take a photo of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they can capture incredible </v>

1996
01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.740
<v Speaker 2>images and pretty low light with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>iphone seven like tmz.</v>

1997
01:21:48.741 --> 01:21:51.230
<v Speaker 2>You guys aren't using iphone of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a reason.</v>

1998
01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We're taking collars.</v>

2004
01:22:09.381 --> 01:22:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Disappointed.</v>

2009
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little nervous about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get out.</v>

01:24:34.411 --> 01:24:36.210
<v Speaker 1>it's just like fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2063
01:24:36.211 --> 01:24:41.211
<v Speaker 1>look how fucking white that tee shirt is</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get like distracted where and I </v>

2064
01:24:41.461 --> 01:24:44.100
<v Speaker 1>think it makes it not look real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you look at,</v>

2065
01:24:45.690 --> 01:24:47.070
<v Speaker 1>if you look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2066
01:24:47.071 --> 01:24:48.150
<v Speaker 1>it's just something that I would look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

2067
01:24:48.151 --> 01:24:50.460
<v Speaker 1>old concert films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd look at old stand up and be like,</v>

2068
01:24:50.461 --> 01:24:55.461
<v Speaker 1>why does this look like this really </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and why dissolve this shit now </v>

2069
01:24:55.461 --> 01:24:58.410
<v Speaker 1>looks so fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of it was it was.</v>

2070
01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:01.800
<v Speaker 1>It was just too fucking clear and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>also like edit,</v>

2071
01:25:01.801 --> 01:25:02.340
<v Speaker 1>edit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>edit,</v>

2072
01:25:02.341 --> 01:25:02.850
<v Speaker 1>edit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>edit.</v>

2073
01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:08.040
<v Speaker 1>As much as it was going through and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes your brain reset and it rather </v>

2074
01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:12.141
<v Speaker 1>than drawing people in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're given them like like an an an </v>

2075
01:25:12.141 --> 01:25:12.141
<v Speaker 1>epileptic</v>

2076
01:25:12.230 --> 01:25:17.230
<v Speaker 5>episode.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did my last special almost entirely </v>

2077
01:25:17.230 --> 01:25:17.390
<v Speaker 5>from the waist up with no edits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very few edits.</v>

2078
01:25:17.391 --> 01:25:22.391
<v Speaker 5>The only time I edit is when I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 5>show a side shot or one and I want to </v>

2079
01:25:22.391 --> 01:25:22.880
<v Speaker 5>show like my whole body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

2080
01:25:22.881 --> 01:25:25.910
<v Speaker 5>I tried to do it where you are right in </v>
<v Speaker 5>front of me just watching,</v>

2081
01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:30.940
<v Speaker 5>just like you would have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're sitting in the crowd at a comedy </v>

2082
01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:30.940
<v Speaker 5>show and they wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2083
01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:31.250
<v Speaker 5>they always want to like show the </v>
<v Speaker 5>audience there was,</v>

2084
01:25:31.251 --> 01:25:33.110
<v Speaker 5>want to show this and cut back and </v>
<v Speaker 5>forth.</v>

2085
01:25:33.111 --> 01:25:35.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every time you do that you make a person</v>

2086
01:25:35.601 --> 01:25:38.870
<v Speaker 5>realize that they're watching a film of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their brain resets to.</v>

2087
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:39.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2088
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:42.100
<v Speaker 1>So you were just drawn them in India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2089
01:25:42.130 --> 01:25:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Like when somebody watches you do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>show you not all of a sudden up in the </v>

2090
01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:48.010
<v Speaker 1>balcony or turning around or swooping </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

2091
01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:50.080
<v Speaker 1>You got to have a little bit of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't have to.</v>

2092
01:25:50.081 --> 01:25:51.400
<v Speaker 1>It does have to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2093
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:52.860
<v Speaker 1>sort of like a concert film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

2094
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:54.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

2095
01:25:54.341 --> 01:25:54.790
<v Speaker 1>how you,</v>

2096
01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:00.360
<v Speaker 5>you pick those now when you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>standup and you're also doing F is for </v>

2097
01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:00.360
<v Speaker 5>family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2098
01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:05.091
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had this conversation the other day </v>

2099
01:26:05.091 --> 01:26:05.091
<v Speaker 5>at the store where you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>how it just of swoops in</v>

2100
01:26:05.091 --> 01:26:06.500
<v Speaker 2>and takes all your time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2101
01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:07.760
<v Speaker 2>during those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2102
01:26:07.761 --> 01:26:09.370
<v Speaker 2>The heavy writing part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2103
01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:14.380
<v Speaker 2>And how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much time do you spend doing that </v>

2104
01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:14.380
<v Speaker 2>show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evidence for fan,</v>

2105
01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:14.420
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking awesome.</v>

2106
01:26:14.450 --> 01:26:17.390
<v Speaker 2>I love that show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's coming out again in May.</v>

2107
01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:19.850
<v Speaker 2>How many episodes did you do at a time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2108
01:26:19.851 --> 01:26:21.590
<v Speaker 2>this time we did 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave us six.</v>

2109
01:26:21.591 --> 01:26:26.591
<v Speaker 2>The first uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first season they gave us six </v>

2110
01:26:26.591 --> 01:26:26.780
<v Speaker 2>because I think they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck do you guys want to do?</v>

2111
01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.420
<v Speaker 2>And then they saw it and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they liked it.</v>

2112
01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:34.570
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm guessing because it was </v>

2113
01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:34.570
<v Speaker 2>a weird order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a half order.</v>

2114
01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:34.570
<v Speaker 2>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2115
01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.840
<v Speaker 2>now we're doing 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2116
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:42.310
<v Speaker 2>so that comes out in May.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just realized that math didn't work </v>

2117
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.310
<v Speaker 2>out on that because it gave me six and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>still,</v>

2118
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:45.230
<v Speaker 2>it was a half four but they used to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>12 but then they whittled it down to 10.</v>

2119
01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:50.260
<v Speaker 2>So now like when you write that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far in advance do you start before </v>

2120
01:26:51.081 --> 01:26:56.081
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it takes awhile to put it </v>

2121
01:26:56.081 --> 01:26:56.081
<v Speaker 2>together and to film it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2122
01:26:56.081 --> 01:26:56.840
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're mapping out the uh,</v>

2123
01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:59.570
<v Speaker 1>the third if we get a third season </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

2124
01:26:59.571 --> 01:27:00.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda weird,</v>

2125
01:27:00.261 --> 01:27:01.940
<v Speaker 1>like you just kind of put it all out at </v>
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>

2126
01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:06.890
<v Speaker 1>So we have to see hopefully the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that watched it the first time come back</v>

2127
01:27:06.891 --> 01:27:09.290
<v Speaker 1>again and then more people come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2128
01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:13.700
<v Speaker 1>as far as how that works is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>

2129
01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:15.410
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2130
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:20.470
<v Speaker 1>it's the war room to do a season is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>map out the season and you really have </v>

2131
01:27:22.431 --> 01:27:27.431
<v Speaker 1>to like work all the bugs out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2132
01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:30.770
<v Speaker 1>and that's the time when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we going to go big here?</v>

2133
01:27:30.771 --> 01:27:33.770
<v Speaker 1>We gonna have this more grounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this going to happen?</v>

2134
01:27:33.771 --> 01:27:38.771
<v Speaker 1>Is that going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you really work out the big </v>

2135
01:27:38.771 --> 01:27:41.510
<v Speaker 1>emotional moments in the story lines </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you get in there.</v>

2136
01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:43.490
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2137
01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:48.820
<v Speaker 1>because as you start to write in this 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the room and the ideas of </v>

2138
01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:49.280
<v Speaker 1>flowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2139
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:51.980
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of veer off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can be a good thing.</v>

2140
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's set in stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is what we're writing,</v>

2141
01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:57.590
<v Speaker 1>but like you just sort of know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2142
01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:02.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going from okay from point a to </v>

2143
01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:04.730
<v Speaker 1>point b than b to c and then how you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is sort of the art of writing it.</v>

2144
01:28:04.731 --> 01:28:07.880
<v Speaker 1>But like you just want to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden,</v>

2145
01:28:07.881 --> 01:28:12.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gold aid over to c and then blah blah </v>

2146
01:28:12.881 --> 01:28:12.881
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you got pete,</v>

2147
01:28:12.881 --> 01:28:13.280
<v Speaker 1>we've got to go back to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we correct all of this?</v>

2148
01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the type of show that you </v>

2149
01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:18.700
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2150
01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm like ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to try to keep it grounded in a</v>

2151
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:25.570
<v Speaker 1>certain level of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also take advantage that it is </v>

2152
01:28:25.570 --> 01:28:25.940
<v Speaker 1>animation so you can get a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>absurd.</v>

2153
01:28:25.941 --> 01:28:27.440
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2154
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:30.020
<v Speaker 1>and it's just like a balance of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fucking recipe.</v>

2155
01:28:30.021 --> 01:28:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2156
01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:35.360
<v Speaker 1>there's too much salt here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be going to do a little bit </v>

2157
01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.200
<v Speaker 1>more of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the first time I've gone this</v>

2158
01:28:36.201 --> 01:28:41.201
<v Speaker 1>far with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I learned a lot in this second </v>

2159
01:28:41.201 --> 01:28:46.121
<v Speaker 1>season about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're really hammering out this this </v>

2160
01:28:46.121 --> 01:28:46.880
<v Speaker 1>third season and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2161
01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:48.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a total newbie.</v>

2162
01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Had you ever written anything before </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>

2163
01:28:52.530 --> 01:28:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2164
01:28:54.591 --> 01:28:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I think I actually could be a decent </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer.</v>

2165
01:28:56.301 --> 01:29:01.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to do it because it's </v>

2166
01:29:01.301 --> 01:29:01.301
<v Speaker 1>so much fucking work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2167
01:29:01.301 --> 01:29:01.301
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to just sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2168
01:29:01.301 --> 01:29:03.660
<v Speaker 1>This whole fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sent it to a studio them and be like,</v>

2169
01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:05.370
<v Speaker 5>change is change and do this.</v>

2170
01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Long ago,</v>

2171
01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:07.840
<v Speaker 1>all the way back to the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2172
01:29:07.841 --> 01:29:08.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2173
01:29:08.891 --> 01:29:13.891
<v Speaker 1>I think if I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't have like then because I </v>

2174
01:29:13.891 --> 01:29:13.891
<v Speaker 1>always have to thing in my head,</v>

01:33:27.610 --> 01:33:29.580
<v Speaker 2>And it's the Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm,</v>

2290
01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:30.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2291
01:33:30.281 --> 01:33:35.281
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in town so I don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and I just go in with my </v>

2292
01:33:35.281 --> 01:33:35.281
<v Speaker 2>iphone and my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my music,</v>

2293
01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:39.280
<v Speaker 2>put the fucking headphones on and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking go nuts for like two hours.</v>

2294
01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:41.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess doing the treadmill,</v>

2295
01:33:41.021 --> 01:33:44.320
<v Speaker 2>which I probably should do more of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just do that and it's the greatest</v>

2296
01:33:44.321 --> 01:33:49.321
<v Speaker 2>thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I'll ask you if I go to </v>

2297
01:33:49.321 --> 01:33:49.321
<v Speaker 2>someplace and they have enough time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2298
01:33:49.321 --> 01:33:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask people my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2299
01:33:50.411 --> 01:33:51.700
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have a good rehearsal </v>
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>

2300
01:33:51.701 --> 01:33:53.410
<v Speaker 2>because there's good ones and bad ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2301
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:55.600
<v Speaker 2>the fucking worst ones that you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the drum kits,</v>

2302
01:33:55.601 --> 01:33:58.170
<v Speaker 2>they're not fucking tune.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get old heads and then everything's</v>

2303
01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:03.180
<v Speaker 2>been over torqued and you got to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking take the sticks to try to get </v>

2304
01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:03.180
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2305
01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:03.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get all frozen up.</v>

2306
01:34:03.610 --> 01:34:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Tiny thing that a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get bummed out about the road is </v>

2307
01:34:08.610 --> 01:34:11.701
<v Speaker 2>because they have to do the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the beautiful things about </v>

2308
01:34:11.701 --> 01:34:14.101
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to do the road you like </v>

2309
01:34:14.101 --> 01:34:16.001
<v Speaker 2>to do the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember one of the things that </v>

2310
01:34:16.001 --> 01:34:16.001
<v Speaker 2>used to really bum me out when I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>do clubs,</v>

2311
01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:19.090
<v Speaker 2>they would tell me that Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jenny was just in town.</v>

2312
01:34:19.091 --> 01:34:21.310
<v Speaker 2>He fucking hated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hates being on the road.</v>

2313
01:34:21.311 --> 01:34:22.660
<v Speaker 2>He was grumpy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just hated,</v>

2314
01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:27.690
<v Speaker 2>hated doing standup because he always </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to have a sitcom who was wanting </v>

2315
01:34:27.690 --> 01:34:28.180
<v Speaker 2>to be like the next Seinfeld and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't happen for him.</v>

2316
01:34:28.181 --> 01:34:33.181
<v Speaker 2>So he was miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile to me he was like one of </v>

2317
01:34:33.181 --> 01:34:33.181
<v Speaker 2>my idols.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2318
01:34:33.181 --> 01:34:35.800
<v Speaker 2>scheduling one of the greatest comics </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever and he doesn't like doing it.</v>

2319
01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:40.980
<v Speaker 2>Like this is all I wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd show up at a club and they'd be </v>

2320
01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:44.491
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm headline and I'm </v>

2321
01:34:44.491 --> 01:34:44.491
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it.</v>

2322
01:34:44.491 --> 01:34:44.491
<v Speaker 2>And then say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2323
01:34:44.491 --> 01:34:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Richard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nice that someone's a actually having</v>

2324
01:34:45.491 --> 01:34:46.300
<v Speaker 2>a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard,</v>

2325
01:34:46.301 --> 01:34:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Jenny was here last week and now he's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>bummed out.</v>

2326
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you never know.</v>

2327
01:34:49.301 --> 01:34:50.680
<v Speaker 2>They'll let scuttle button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The club.</v>

2328
01:34:50.681 --> 01:34:52.870
<v Speaker 2>He could have just been in a bad moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was a cut that week,</v>

2329
01:34:52.871 --> 01:34:54.440
<v Speaker 2>so then all of a sudden that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2330
01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:56.240
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he's not here to defend </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether,</v>

2331
01:34:56.370 --> 01:34:57.580
<v Speaker 2>whether he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked it,</v>

2332
01:34:57.581 --> 01:35:02.581
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the level that that guy wrote in the </v>

2333
01:35:02.581 --> 01:35:02.581
<v Speaker 2>specialist that he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had to have enjoyed it.</v>

2334
01:35:02.581 --> 01:35:04.970
<v Speaker 2>He enjoyed some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was friends with his ex girlfriend</v>

2335
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:08.270
<v Speaker 2>and she was telling me that that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really the case.</v>

2336
01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:08.870
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't.</v>

2337
01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:13.920
<v Speaker 2>I was really trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that you wouldn't have confirmed </v>

2338
01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:13.920
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2339
01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:16.190
<v Speaker 2>Well I think back then that was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>carrot though.</v>

2340
01:35:16.191 --> 01:35:19.070
<v Speaker 2>The carrot was always the Sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like that was what everybody went</v>

2341
01:35:19.071 --> 01:35:21.440
<v Speaker 2>for and if you didn't get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you felt bummed out.</v>

2342
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Whereas somewhere along the line we </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized that's not necessarily true.</v>

2343
01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.180
<v Speaker 2>You're better off without the Sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're better off just being a big name,</v>

2344
01:35:29.181 --> 01:35:31.820
<v Speaker 2>stand up comic and having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're throwing shit.</v>

2345
01:35:31.821 --> 01:35:34.740
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to deal with producers </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when he came up you had to,</v>

2346
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:37.430
<v Speaker 2>you had to be given a special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't just do it.</v>

2347
01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also the network money was </v>

2348
01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:42.600
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you could get to syndication,</v>

2349
01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:47.680
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were set for life and syndication </v>

2350
01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:47.680
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2351
01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:47.680
<v Speaker 2>like when Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no syndication,</v>

2352
01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.460
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's automatically syndicated.</v>

2353
01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:51.500
<v Speaker 2>While I was on two shows that went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>syndication,</v>

2354
01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:54.170
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not what everybody thinks it is.</v>

2355
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're one of the owners of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

2356
01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:02.080
<v Speaker 2>it's big time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I was sitting news radio's in </v>

2357
01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:02.080
<v Speaker 2>syndication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I got,</v>

2358
01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:05.030
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of money from it,</v>

2359
01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.360
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't like Seinfeld money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it goes down to like $7 checks </v>

2360
01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:15.221
<v Speaker 2>really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like however that fucking math works </v>

2361
01:36:15.221 --> 01:36:17.480
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to think with my buddies a like </v>

2362
01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:17.550
<v Speaker 2>you just take pictures of residual </v>
<v Speaker 2>checks,</v>

2363
01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:21.260
<v Speaker 2>like trying to beat each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And two of my friends got the one cent,</v>

2364
01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:23.410
<v Speaker 2>they all within a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love.</v>

2365
01:36:24.130 --> 01:36:28.190
<v Speaker 1>She didn't think that exists because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a lot of like dollar 17.</v>

2366
01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2367
01:36:31.190 --> 01:36:31.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a,</v>

2368
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:37.030
<v Speaker 1>I got a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say the name of the </v>

2369
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.030
<v Speaker 1>fucking movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

2370
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a big time fucking moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody loves it.</v>

2371
01:36:37.710 --> 01:36:42.710
<v Speaker 1>And they showed it one time on a network</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 24 hours straight and he got played </v>

2372
01:36:44.301 --> 01:36:47.180
<v Speaker 1>for one plane because it was just one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

2373
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:50.210
<v Speaker 1>but they sold advertising for 24 fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

2374
01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:56.180
<v Speaker 1>They do because they just do it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sit back and wait for you to sue </v>

2375
01:36:56.961 --> 01:36:59.210
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Are you going to go?</v>

2376
01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Is this going to be worth it to you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go through that?</v>

2377
01:37:02.391 --> 01:37:04.760
<v Speaker 1>So like the zone probably 20 bucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

2378
01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Well what I learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately it just like the number </v>

2379
01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:14.171
<v Speaker 1>one commandment of the 10 commandments </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the number one that's broken I </v>

2380
01:37:14.171 --> 01:37:14.171
<v Speaker 1>think is stealing.</v>

2381
01:37:14.171 --> 01:37:15.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as stealing is,</v>

2382
01:37:15.801 --> 01:37:20.801
<v Speaker 1>you basically have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you basically have the illegal side of </v>

2383
01:37:20.801 --> 01:37:24.191
<v Speaker 1>stealing in the legal side of stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So any smart criminal is trying to make </v>

2384
01:37:24.191 --> 01:37:27.170
<v Speaker 1>his business legit so he doesn't have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hide his fucking money anymore.</v>

2385
01:37:27.171 --> 01:37:32.171
<v Speaker 1>But he can continue to just rob people </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking blind because that's basically </v>

2386
01:37:32.171 --> 01:37:34.340
<v Speaker 1>what happens is everybody just like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2387
01:37:34.341 --> 01:37:36.110
<v Speaker 1>some of the deals that I've signed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for,</v>

2388
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:41.290
<v Speaker 1>for Shit like it okay if you audit us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're only off by like three </v>

2389
01:37:41.290 --> 01:37:45.251
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to pay for the audit and </v>

2390
01:37:45.251 --> 01:37:45.251
<v Speaker 1>like you literally just built into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal,</v>

2391
01:37:45.251 --> 01:37:49.871
<v Speaker 1>a license to steal three percent plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I have to catch you with steel nine</v>

2392
01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:52.520
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to basically skim like whatever,</v>

2393
01:37:52.521 --> 01:37:55.130
<v Speaker 1>nine percent off of this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2394
01:37:55.250 --> 01:38:00.250
<v Speaker 1>and they go to sleep at night and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel they're good people and they don't </v>

2395
01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:00.660
<v Speaker 1>give a fuck that they're driving a car </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2396
01:38:00.710 --> 01:38:05.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of other people paid for and </v>

2397
01:38:05.710 --> 01:38:05.710
<v Speaker 1>they took the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a shit.</v>

2398
01:38:05.710 --> 01:38:06.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Legal loopholes,</v>

2399
01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:10.160
<v Speaker 5>legal loopholes and find print.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's a dirty world</v>

2401
01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:15.800
<v Speaker 1>starting as far as trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not reporting is taxes and all that</v>

2402
01:38:15.801 --> 01:38:20.801
<v Speaker 1>type of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can only get so mad where </v>

2403
01:38:20.801 --> 01:38:20.801
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2404
01:38:20.801 --> 01:38:23.780
<v Speaker 1>so because he figured out the game where</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of like,</v>

2405
01:38:23.781 --> 01:38:27.670
<v Speaker 1>well I'm just robin from thieves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2406
01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Like that whole fucking bolt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like politicians is so underpaid.</v>

2407
01:38:31.671 --> 01:38:36.671
<v Speaker 1>They need all these guys money to get in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and then when they get in there </v>

2408
01:38:36.671 --> 01:38:40.781
<v Speaker 1>they got to hook them up and they give </v>
<v Speaker 1>him these governmental contracts in the </v>

2409
01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:42.020
<v Speaker 1>fact that they're allowed to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking overcharged.</v>

2410
01:38:42.021 --> 01:38:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Like the level they do is just this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing.</v>

2411
01:38:45.170 --> 01:38:48.160
<v Speaker 1>So you're giving you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have no problem playing,</v>

2412
01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:53.290
<v Speaker 1>paying taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What fucking drives me up the wall is </v>

2413
01:38:53.290 --> 01:38:56.141
<v Speaker 1>knowing that like the amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say you give them fucking 50 grand,</v>

2414
01:38:56.691 --> 01:39:00.830
<v Speaker 1>like the amount of that money that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually going to go for the supplies to</v>

2415
01:39:00.831 --> 01:39:05.831
<v Speaker 1>make a school better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to feel like a fucking pothole and then </v>

2416
01:39:05.831 --> 01:39:05.831
<v Speaker 1>the amount that's just going to go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2417
01:39:05.831 --> 01:39:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a shiny watch.</v>

2418
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:10.880
<v Speaker 1>My wife needs fake tits fund on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

2419
01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:12.750
<v Speaker 1>That's what eats me up at night because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2420
01:39:12.751 --> 01:39:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2421
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:20.350
<v Speaker 5>you see what trump did where he's filed </v>
<v Speaker 5>for reelection five hours after he took </v>

2422
01:39:20.361 --> 01:39:22.490
<v Speaker 5>office.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one's ever done that before.</v>

2423
01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:27.440
<v Speaker 5>Everybody files for reelection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a year out from the reelection.</v>

2424
01:39:27.650 --> 01:39:30.500
<v Speaker 5>He filed for reelection five hours after</v>
<v Speaker 5>office.</v>

2425
01:39:30.501 --> 01:39:33.560
<v Speaker 5>That means when anybody addresses him in</v>
<v Speaker 5>any sort of a campaign ad,</v>

2426
01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:38.920
<v Speaker 5>they have to address him as if they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>running against him to anything because </v>

2427
01:39:38.961 --> 01:39:40.580
<v Speaker 5>he's already running for president </v>
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

2428
01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:45.760
<v Speaker 5>He's running for president in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he's essentially change the way they </v>

2429
01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:46.010
<v Speaker 5>dress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't say Mr.</v>

2430
01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:46.820
<v Speaker 5>President.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2431
01:39:46.821 --> 01:39:48.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Mr.</v>

2432
01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:49.520
<v Speaker 5>President,</v>
<v Speaker 5>president,</v>

2433
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:52.160
<v Speaker 5>pull it up and we'll be able to figure </v>
<v Speaker 5>out what it.</v>

2434
01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.940
<v Speaker 5>What it means.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Figure out what the guy he's organized.</v>

2435
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.950
<v Speaker 5>Say what you want about them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The men is organized.</v>

2436
01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:59.120
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's definitely organized.</v>

2437
01:39:59.121 --> 01:40:04.121
<v Speaker 5>He's mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's been just juking and fucking </v>

2438
01:40:04.121 --> 01:40:07.490
<v Speaker 5>shucking and jiving in business for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>long fucking time,</v>

2439
01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:13.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he knows how to get his name on </v>

2440
01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:13.120
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2441
01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:16.630
<v Speaker 5>Everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some giant building that's gold </v>

2442
01:40:16.630 --> 01:40:17.720
<v Speaker 5>and it says trump on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we're going to be all right.</v>

2443
01:40:17.721 --> 01:40:18.830
<v Speaker 5>We'll be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

2444
01:40:18.930 --> 01:40:19.440
<v Speaker 5>Well yeah,</v>

2445
01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:22.780
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of the amount of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's already fucking annoyed.</v>

2446
01:40:22.781 --> 01:40:24.790
<v Speaker 1>You figured the midterm elections come </v>
<v Speaker 1>two years in.</v>

2447
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.000
<v Speaker 1>He's got his shit where he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sprint for fucking two years and then I </v>

2448
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.280
<v Speaker 1>think everybody else is just going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>vote for fucking blue ties and blue bras</v>

2449
01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:34.450
<v Speaker 1>and the fucking next one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2450
01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:36.640
<v Speaker 1>and you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2451
01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what always happens after </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking eight years of Clinton.</v>

2452
01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Then it went red and then eight years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush.</v>

2453
01:40:42.821 --> 01:40:45.190
<v Speaker 1>This'll make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go over to Obama.</v>

2454
01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back over to fucking a.</v>

2455
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:49.840
<v Speaker 1>let's go back over to the</v>

2456
01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:55.120
<v Speaker 5>side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we'd like to see someone who is </v>

2457
01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:58.350
<v Speaker 5>in the middle of things though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We would really like to see someone who </v>

2458
01:40:58.350 --> 01:41:01.321
<v Speaker 5>has more maybe libertarian values or </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone who's more just not adequately </v>

2459
01:41:01.490 --> 01:41:02.530
<v Speaker 5>writer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Clearly left</v>

2460
01:41:02.670 --> 01:41:07.670
<v Speaker 1>somebody a little more secure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His insecurity is what scares me the </v>

2461
01:41:07.670 --> 01:41:09.030
<v Speaker 1>most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like tweeting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like he's so fucking insecure that </v>

2465
01:41:16.971 --> 01:41:19.701
<v Speaker 1>people are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think his daughter is not good looking </v>

2466
01:41:19.701 --> 01:41:22.221

<v Speaker 1>He says what he wants people to say and </v>

2467
01:41:22.221 --> 01:41:22.221
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't thinking like context.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2482
01:41:55.351 --> 01:41:56.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2483
01:41:56.250 --> 01:42:01.250
<v Speaker 1>we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's funny is by finding </v>

2484
01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:01.480
<v Speaker 1>fascinating as far as like the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be loved to behave,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2490
01:42:12.151 --> 01:42:17.151

<v Speaker 1>It's weird that you could have that </v>

2491
01:42:17.151 --> 01:42:17.151
<v Speaker 1>personality and still want to be liked.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

2493
01:42:17.151 --> 01:42:20.820
<v Speaker 1>do you enjoy being treated like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then why would you treat other people?</v>

2494
01:42:21.570 --> 01:42:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this way,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

<v Speaker 1>his ram it down their throat,</v>

2497

<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2498
01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you like those stupid Hollywood movies </v>
<v Speaker 1>where somebody grabs a two by four when </v>

2499
01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:36.440
<v Speaker 1>I cleaned this town up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just like he's going to hurt a</v>

2500
01:42:36.441 --> 01:42:41.441
<v Speaker 1>lot of people because there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent people are going to get caught </v>

2501
01:42:41.441 --> 01:42:45.011
<v Speaker 1>up in the wash of a very simplistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to a huge problem.</v>

2502
01:42:45.490 --> 01:42:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get rid of all of them.</v>

2503
01:42:46.970 --> 01:42:47.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2504
01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2505
01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:52.070
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the fucking answers.</v>

2506
01:42:52.071 --> 01:42:54.890
<v Speaker 1>I just wish like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2507
01:42:54.891 --> 01:42:56.120
<v Speaker 1>What is this Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would he pull?</v>

2508
01:42:56.121 --> 01:43:01.121
<v Speaker 1>Pulling up here is about why the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are brought up when filing early </v>

2509
01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:02.960
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

2510
01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:08.120
<v Speaker 5>A candidate for president is subject to </v>
<v Speaker 5>different rules than a president is </v>

2511
01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:11.271
<v Speaker 5>afforded different projections.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This has critics on edge and already </v>

2512
01:43:11.761 --> 01:43:16.761
<v Speaker 5>existing concerns about trump's business</v>
<v Speaker 5>entanglements are now heightened by </v>

2513
01:43:16.761 --> 01:43:20.871
<v Speaker 5>fears that US nationals could fund </v>
<v Speaker 5>funnel cash to trump through his </v>

2514
01:43:20.871 --> 01:43:24.310
<v Speaker 5>campaign committee trumps status as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>candidate.</v>

2515
01:43:24.311 --> 01:43:28.600
<v Speaker 5>You could also make it difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 5>nonprofit organizations take actions for</v>

2516
01:43:28.601 --> 01:43:31.180
<v Speaker 5>or against trump and his </v>

<v Speaker 5>Organizations have leeway for political </v>

2518
01:43:36.630 --> 01:43:40.201

<v Speaker 5>have more leeway for political action </v>

2519
01:43:40.201 --> 01:43:42.811
<v Speaker 5>than other nonprofits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but are still prohibited from certain </v>

2520
01:43:42.811 --> 01:43:45.151
<v Speaker 5>political actions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Leading some to worry that trump's </v>

2521
01:43:45.151 --> 01:43:45.220
<v Speaker 5>filings could be a tactic to reduce </v>
<v Speaker 5>opposition.</v>

2522
01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Cus that's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great move.</v>

2524
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:52.280
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Considering what he's done so far,</v>

2525
01:43:52.281 --> 01:43:55.490
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make you feel comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It will survive it.</v>

01:43:57.430 --> 01:44:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do this to fucking </v>

2528
01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:02.430
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't.</v>

2529
01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:02.430
<v Speaker 1>You just have somebody fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>levelheaded.</v>

2530
01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:05.060

<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I didn't like um,</v>

2532
01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:14.030
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like his entire demonization of</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who had money was automatically.</v>

2533
01:44:14.031 --> 01:44:19.031
<v Speaker 1>It just was so simple and that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is broke was a fucking hero and it </v>

2534
01:44:19.031 --> 01:44:20.120
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's too fucking big.</v>

2538
01:44:27.170 --> 01:44:28.700
<v Speaker 1>I just knew that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

2539
01:44:28.730 --> 01:44:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like Hillary or I didn't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump and I was praying to God that </v>

2540

2544
01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't think she was a,</v>

2545
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:48.530
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't trust her.</v>

2546
01:44:48.531 --> 01:44:53.531
<v Speaker 1>I just thought she was a big time phony </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just felt like she would just </v>

2547
01:44:53.531 --> 01:44:55.550
<v Speaker 1>fucking do or say I didn't like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking 2008 that she blew the bankers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>are upside down in their houses and then</v>

2550
01:45:00.651 --> 01:45:03.710
<v Speaker 1>has the nerve to act like she's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's candidate,</v>

2551
01:45:03.711 --> 01:45:07.640
<v Speaker 1>which is really a sticking point with me</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Democrats is they fucking sit there</v>

2552
01:45:07.641 --> 01:45:10.130
<v Speaker 1>and they act like they're men and women </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the people.</v>

2553
01:45:10.131 --> 01:45:15.131
<v Speaker 1>It's like you guys are all filthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stinking rich to you and you guys all </v>

2554
01:45:15.131 --> 01:45:19.031

<v Speaker 1>bit most highest paying fucking job you </v>

2555
01:45:19.031 --> 01:45:20.630
<v Speaker 1>can get as the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which pays 500 grand a fucking year.</v>

2556
01:45:21.250 --> 01:45:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're over 250 grand a year,</v>

2557
01:45:23.691 --> 01:45:25.280
<v Speaker 1>which means you're going to get this </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit taxed out of you.</v>

2558
01:45:25.281 --> 01:45:28.040
<v Speaker 1>So how the fuck did you end up being </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth 40,</v>

2559
01:45:28.041 --> 01:45:29.510
<v Speaker 1>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars?</v>

2560
01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:32.720
<v Speaker 1>There's no way what you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>above board.</v>

2561
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Every politician crushes it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>private sector.</v>

2562
01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:37.270
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2563
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:42.430
<v Speaker 1>everyone goes fucking yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody starts a business and it shits </v>

2564
01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:42.770
<v Speaker 1>the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2565
01:45:42.771 --> 01:45:43.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2566

<v Speaker 1>they said the percentage of senators and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make like,</v>

2567
01:45:45.230 --> 01:45:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the 200 grand a year or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2568
01:45:46.581 --> 01:45:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2569
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:50.300
<v Speaker 1>there the amount of them that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>multimillionaires.</v>

2570
01:45:50.570 --> 01:45:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most disturbing thing is public </v>

2571
01:45:55.570 --> 01:45:57.101
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you find out that she's speaking </v>

2572
01:45:57.101 --> 01:45:57.101
<v Speaker 1>for the bankers and she's doing these </v>
<v Speaker 1>$250,000,</v>

2573
01:45:57.101 --> 01:45:59.870
<v Speaker 1>our long speeches and they're washing </v>
<v Speaker 1>their bribe money.</v>

2574
01:45:59.871 --> 01:46:01.790
<v Speaker 1>It's the people that paid you to get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2575
01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:04.550
<v Speaker 1>You did what they wanted them to do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then just like a comedian,</v>

2576
01:46:04.551 --> 01:46:07.520
<v Speaker 1>you get to do your college tour and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>grossly fucking over.</v>

2577
01:46:07.570 --> 01:46:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I used to do a bit about it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're giving a speech,</v>

2578
01:46:09.801 --> 01:46:14.801
<v Speaker 1>they're not even listening to their city</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're eating like a fucking deep </v>

2579
01:46:14.801 --> 01:46:15.200
<v Speaker 1>fried eagle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not even giving a fuck.</v>

2580
01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:20.820
<v Speaker 1>It's so overt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's almost like a serial killer </v>

2581
01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:21.180
<v Speaker 1>that wants to get caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just felt like,</v>

2582
01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:25.160
<v Speaker 1>like she was just going to be more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same of that preaching,</v>

2583
01:46:25.161 --> 01:46:28.610
<v Speaker 1>this fucking rhetoric as they just keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>deregulate and shit and trump,</v>

2584
01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:30.650
<v Speaker 1>I feel like what he wants to do aside </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

2585
01:46:30.651 --> 01:46:31.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2586
01:46:31.881 --> 01:46:33.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think he,</v>

2587
01:46:33.170 --> 01:46:38.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he's at the level of rich that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he finds the government a nuisance and </v>

2588
01:46:38.170 --> 01:46:40.580
<v Speaker 1>he wants to deregulate everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the time he leaves,</v>

2589
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:45.080
<v Speaker 1>he can put a golf course on top of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pipeline on a fucking,</v>

2590
01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:47.190
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2591
01:46:47.410 --> 01:46:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Indian reservation land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>native American,</v>

2592
01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:51.490
<v Speaker 1>like I feel like that's what he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

2593
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:52.950
<v Speaker 1>His goals are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2594
01:46:53.670 --> 01:46:58.670
<v Speaker 1>beyond the bullshit that he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going in there and he </v>

2595
01:46:58.670 --> 01:47:00.330
<v Speaker 1>finally gets through like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2596
01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:04.350

2597
01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:09.351
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to win the presidency to do it </v>

2598
01:47:09.351 --> 01:47:11.400
<v Speaker 1>and the fucking guy did it and I have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say it,</v>

2599
01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:15.240
<v Speaker 1>the storm watching that guy that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>weathered was amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the gears in that election.</v>

01:49:44.451 --> 01:49:48.160
<v Speaker 1>hour long spots on television,</v>

2662
01:49:57.690 --> 01:49:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Clinton did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>

2663
01:49:57.761 --> 01:49:59.910
<v Speaker 2>you can't get people to vote for them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they,</v>

2664
01:50:00.190 --> 01:50:01.720
<v Speaker 2>they worry that they're throwing their </v>
<v Speaker 2>vote away.</v>
