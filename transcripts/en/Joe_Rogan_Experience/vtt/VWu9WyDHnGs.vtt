1
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times it's just giving people</v>

2
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:06.030
<v Speaker 1>information right then and there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting people riled up and excited and</v>

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.030
<v Speaker 1>giving them the support to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do about a 40 city tour</v>

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>of solutions grassroots in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>state in February and March.</v>

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>So we'll do like three or four towns a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.231
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll,</v>

9
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I'll be doing that with Zephyr teachout</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was incredibly popular,</v>

10
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate for governor who won 35% of</v>

11
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>the vote against Andrew Cuomo and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>last election.</v>

12
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a number of musical guests.</v>

13
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to be doing that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>February and March.</v>

14
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.840
<v Speaker 1>We'd love to do the solutions grassroots</v>
<v Speaker 1>tour in California.</v>

15
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to do it in other states.</v>

16
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>So you can go to solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grassroots.com you can sign up there.</v>

17
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:45.701
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

18
00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>there are links that directly you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy solar.</v>

19
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can buy wind power,</v>

20
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:53.040
<v Speaker 1>you can do all of that at a consumer</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

21
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.290
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're trying to do with solutions</v>

22
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:57.710
<v Speaker 1>grassroots is getting grassroots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>energy movement towards getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves off fossil fuels.</v>

24
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Because you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though like you can map this out at</v>

25
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Stanford and you have these great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing celebrities all talking about</v>

26
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>renewable energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people have to get it done.</v>

27
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 1>We have to get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to say,</v>

28
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to buy oil and gas and coal</v>

29
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.810
<v Speaker 1>to heat my home to power my home</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

30
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get off of it.</v>

31
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.490
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 1>some of the resources are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive,</v>

33
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>like buying an electric car that's out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the range for a lot of people.</v>

34
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>But getting solar on your roof actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>is economic.</v>

35
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting a buying locally sourced wind</v>

36
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 1>power is possible in a lot of states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not in California,</v>

37
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is in New York state.</v>

38
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>There's a company called ethical</v>
<v Speaker 1>electric that we have a link</v>

39
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>to@ourwebsitesolutionsgrassroots.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can just basically say,</v>

40
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy wind power instead of</v>

41
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>buying electricity from coal or oil or</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas.</v>

42
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>you've done a huge amount right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the biggest thing that we've done in</v>

44
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 1>terms of all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>

45
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.690
<v Speaker 1>by stopping fracking kept the equivalent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 57 million cars off the road just by</v>

46
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:15.441
<v Speaker 1>keeping that stuff in the ground there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the equivalent of taking 72</v>

47
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.610
<v Speaker 1>coal fire power plants offline for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

48
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>the movement is actually going to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve these things.</v>

49
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

50
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>it's like how do you get people</v>
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>

51
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just get together,</v>

52
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>have a film screening.</v>

53
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of great films on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

54
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>We have a tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a talk and you start organizing</v>

55
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>locally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume happened.</v>

56
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>I just bought a new book that I highly</v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend about dolphins.</v>

57
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>It's called wet goddess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's available on Amazon.</v>

58
00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>It's about a relationship basically like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person in a 50 shades of grey for</v>

59
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.564
<v Speaker 1>dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

60
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you actually read it now?</v>

61
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got it just delivered today.</v>

62
00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:51.140
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

63
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a goddess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny,</v>

64
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

65
00:02:56.791 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I bought two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can never have</v>

66
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 2>too many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the cover.</v>

67
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like a scrapbook with</v>

68
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:05.720
<v Speaker 2>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did you buy two?</v>

69
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Why did you buy too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like it's not going to be a</v>

70
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

71
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be around for long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're holding onto it.</v>

72
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be a hoarder from</v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphin porn.</v>

73
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.721
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

74
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean like they're used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going for $61</v>

75
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.911
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

76
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a big mark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>

77
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 2>this one's 900 wives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

78
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 2>How is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that probably not all paperback?</v>

79
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 2>That's gotta be the hard copy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's to actually get the dolphin to</v>

80
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.350
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a code code underground.</v>

81
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the spout on that Dolphin.</v>

82
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 2>You just buy the book and inside the</v>
<v Speaker 2>book it's just directions to this place</v>

83
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 2>in San Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the weird things about</v>

84
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:42.950
<v Speaker 2>people</v>

85
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.320
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a dolphin porn or something like</v>

86
00:03:45.321 --> 00:03:45.981
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would think,</v>

87
00:03:45.981 --> 00:03:47.960
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck would be into that?</v>

88
00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.480
<v Speaker 3>And then you put it online and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>attracts a whole community.</v>

89
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.020
<v Speaker 3>And the next thing you know is a message</v>
<v Speaker 3>board all filled with people that are</v>

90
00:03:54.021 --> 00:03:58.820
<v Speaker 3>talking about their dolphin porn and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dolphin love and their kinship of you.</v>

91
00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:01.040
<v Speaker 3>If you've heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people,</v>

92
00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:04.550
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to be judged by being</v>
<v Speaker 3>akin to certain animals.</v>

93
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.480
<v Speaker 3>They feel like their Fox kin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they feel connected to a Fox.</v>

94
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

95
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.990
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

96
00:04:11.991 --> 00:04:14.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can sort of understand to a certain</v>

97
00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:16.910
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this movie a few years ago and I</v>

98
00:04:16.911 --> 00:04:20.750
<v Speaker 2>had to ride an elephant in it and when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was standing there with the elephant,</v>

99
00:04:20.751 --> 00:04:24.830
<v Speaker 2>the way the elephant was looking at me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was looking at her,</v>

100
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.960
<v Speaker 2>I really felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

101
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.980
<v Speaker 2>I really love you elephants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I genuinely felt like,</v>

102
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.120
<v Speaker 2>I think I have a crush on this elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not in a sexual way.</v>

103
00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:36.950
<v Speaker 2>More like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to hug you and love you.</v>

104
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trainers have to fall in love with their</v>

105
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:40.510
<v Speaker 2>animals a lot too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

106
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.411
<v Speaker 2>Beat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

107
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 2>stop fucking hitting him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that spiked fucking stick.</v>

108
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

109
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people that believe that they</v>

110
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.750
<v Speaker 3>are akin like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're somehow or another,</v>

111
00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:53.090
<v Speaker 3>they should have been this animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of a person.</v>

112
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.070
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people think that they were born</v>

113
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.780
<v Speaker 3>male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they really should have been a</v>

114
00:04:56.781 --> 00:04:57.351
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

115
00:04:57.351 --> 00:04:59.600
<v Speaker 3>Some people think that they were born a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

116
00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:01.010
<v Speaker 3>but they should have been an elephant.</v>

117
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

118

<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying people don't,</v>

120
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.840
<v Speaker 3>people don't understand does it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole tumbler blog about it.</v>

121
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.723
<v Speaker 3>Good Lord.</v>

122
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Do they try to manifest physically into</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things?</v>

123
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well some of those folks that are</v>

124
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.220

<v Speaker 2>and he's flapping.</v>

126
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.910

<v Speaker 3>Some of those people,</v>

127
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:35.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that's what they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

128
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 3>They're wishing that they actually were</v>
<v Speaker 3>some weird animal.</v>

129
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.660

<v Speaker 3>I think that's escapism.</v>

130
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:43.350
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of what people do is</v>

131
00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:47.380
<v Speaker 3>escape is I'm including being into shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>that everybody just accepts.</v>

132
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 3>Like being in a dungeons and dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's escapism.</v>

133
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 3>Being into cosplay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's escapism.</v>

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 3>Like at what point do we decide it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up?</v>

135
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Like it's okay if you want to dress up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and reenact the civil war,</v>
