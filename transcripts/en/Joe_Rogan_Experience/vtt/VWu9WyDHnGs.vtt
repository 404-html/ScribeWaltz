<v Speaker 1>getting people riled up and excited and</v>

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>giving them the support to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do about a 40 city tour</v>

6
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>of solutions grassroots in New York</v>

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>so we'll do like three or four towns a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

8
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.301
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll,</v>

9
00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:27.301
<v Speaker 1>I'll be doing that with Zephyr teachout</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was incredibly popular candidate for</v>

10
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>governor who won 35 percent of the vote</v>
<v Speaker 1>against Andrew Cuomo and his last</v>

11
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>and the number of musical guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to be doing that in</v>

13
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>February and March.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd love to do the solutions grassroots</v>

14
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:40.730
<v Speaker 1>tour in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>love to do it in other states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can go to solutions</v>

16
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>grassroots.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can sign up there.</v>

17
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:48.420
<v Speaker 1>You go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are links that directly you can</v>

18
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:49.240
<v Speaker 1>buy solar.</v>

19
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can buy wind power,</v>

20
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:53.040
<v Speaker 1>you can do all of that at a consumer</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

21
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.290
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're trying to do with solutions</v>

22
00:00:55.291 --> 00:01:00.291
<v Speaker 1>grassroots is get grassroots energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement towards getting ourselves off</v>

23
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>fossil fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know this,</v>

24
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 1>even though like you can map this out at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanford and you have these great,</v>

25
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 1>amazing celebrities all talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>renewable energy,</v>

26
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>the people have to get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to get it done.</v>

27
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>We have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

28
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:21.201
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to buy oil and gas and coal</v>
<v Speaker 1>to heat my home to power my home</v>

29
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that anymore.</v>

30
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I want to get off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

31
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the resources are very</v>

32
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like buying an electric car that's out</v>

33
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>of the range for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But getting solar on your roof actually</v>

34
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>is economic.</v>

35
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting a buying locally sourced wind</v>

36
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>power is possible in a lot of states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not in California,</v>

37
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is in New York.</v>

38
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Stated there's a company called ethical</v>
<v Speaker 1>electric that we have a link to at our</v>

39
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>website solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grassroots.com.</v>

40
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Or you can just basically say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

41
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy wind power instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying electricity from coal or oil or</v>

42
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:55.430
<v Speaker 1>gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

43
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done a huge amount right there.</v>

44
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>But the biggest thing that we've done in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of all this stuff,</v>

45
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by stopping fracking kept the equivalent</v>

46
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 1>of $57 million cars off the road just by</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping that stuff in the ground there.</v>

47
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.480
<v Speaker 1>And I think the equivalent of taking 72</v>
<v Speaker 1>coal fire power plants offline for a</v>

48
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movement is actually going to help</v>

49
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:21.860
<v Speaker 1>solve these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

50
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get people together?</v>

51
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just get together.</v>

52
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>We have a film screening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of great films on this</v>

53
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a tour,</v>

54
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:34.800
<v Speaker 1>we have a talk and you start organizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>locally.</v>

55
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>I it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just bought a new book that I highly</v>

56
00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>recommend about dolphins called wet</v>
<v Speaker 1>goddess,</v>

57
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's available on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about a relationship because the</v>

58
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.270
<v Speaker 1>only person in 50 shades of grey for</v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins really?</v>

59
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Did you actually read it now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't read it yet.</v>

60
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:51.440
<v Speaker 1>I just got delivered today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's here.</v>

61
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so funny.</v>

62
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.740
<v Speaker 1>But it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

63
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I bought two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can never have</v>

64
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 2>too many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like the cover.</v>

65
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like a scrapbook with</v>

66
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:05.750
<v Speaker 2>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did you buy two?</v>

67
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Why did you bite too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like it's not going to be A.</v>

68
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be around for.</v>

69
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 2>You're holding onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be a hoarder for dolphin</v>

70
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.321
<v Speaker 2>porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

71
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like they used are going for $61.</v>

72
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

73
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a big mark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>

74
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 2>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how has that is probably not the paper</v>

75
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 2>bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be the hard copy.</v>

76
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.710
<v Speaker 2>That's to actually get the dolphin to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you code the code underground about</v>

77
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 2>look at the spout on that Dolphin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just buy the book and inside the</v>

78
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 2>book it's just directions to this place</v>
<v Speaker 2>in San Diego.</v>

79
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the weird things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>people when it comes to stuff like like</v>

80
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:44.720
<v Speaker 2>a dolphin</v>

81
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.980
<v Speaker 3>porn or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would think,</v>

82
00:03:45.981 --> 00:03:49.340
<v Speaker 3>well who the fuck would be into that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you put it online and it</v>

83
00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 3>attracts a whole community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know,</v>

84
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.680
<v Speaker 3>there's a message board all filled with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are talking about their</v>

85
00:03:54.681 --> 00:03:58.460
<v Speaker 3>dolphin porn and the dolphin love and</v>
<v Speaker 3>their kinship.</v>

86
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.040
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people,</v>

87
00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:04.550
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to be judged by being</v>
<v Speaker 3>akin to certain animals.</v>

88
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.650
<v Speaker 3>They feel like they're fox can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

89
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.480
<v Speaker 3>they feel connected to a Fox.</v>

90
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

91
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.990
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

92
00:04:11.991 --> 00:04:14.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can sort of understand to a certain</v>

93
00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:16.910
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this movie a few years ago and I</v>

94
00:04:16.911 --> 00:04:20.750
<v Speaker 2>had to write an elephant in it and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was standing there with the elephant,</v>

95
00:04:20.751 --> 00:04:24.830
<v Speaker 2>the way the elephant was looking at me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was looking at her,</v>

96
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.050
<v Speaker 2>I really felt like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really love you.</v>

97
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.480
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I genuinely felt like I think I have a</v>

98
00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:35.090
<v Speaker 2>crush on this elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not in a sexual way.</v>

99
00:04:35.091 --> 00:04:36.950
<v Speaker 2>More like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to hug you and love you.</v>

100
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trainers have to fall in love with their</v>

101
00:04:38.871 --> 00:04:41.000
<v Speaker 2>animals a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't understand when they beat</v>

102
00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like stuck fucking hitting him with</v>

103
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.970
<v Speaker 2>that spiked fucking stick.</v>

104
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

105
00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:48.980
<v Speaker 3>There are people that believe that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are akin like,</v>

106
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.320
<v Speaker 3>like they're somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should have been this animal</v>

107
00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:53.490
<v Speaker 3>instead of a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

108
00:04:53.491 --> 00:04:56.070
<v Speaker 3>some people think that they were born</v>
<v Speaker 3>male,</v>

109
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:57.060
<v Speaker 3>but they really should have been a</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>

110
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.580
<v Speaker 3>Some people think that they were born a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

111
00:04:59.581 --> 00:05:02.070
<v Speaker 3>but they should have been an elephant of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shit that's,</v>

112
00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:03.390
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a little mental.</v>

113
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Is it though for you to judge people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't people don't understand there's a,</v>

114
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.620
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole tumbler blog about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good Lord.</v>

115
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 3>Do they</v>

116
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 2>try to manifest physically into these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things?</v>

117
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.070
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
