1
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Fuck's going on?</v>

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>So this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry for the late start.</v>

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.560
<v Speaker 1>We were all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a,</v>

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>we weren't all fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cam is all fucked up.</v>

5
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.860
<v Speaker 1>That a problem with the Webcam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're is high right now and I'm back</v>

6
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>from Abu motherfucking dobby son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was very strange.</v>

7
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.820
<v Speaker 2>Scary at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's scary.</v>

8
00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:32.090
<v Speaker 2>It scared me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

9
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's real safe and it's real </v>

10
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.610
<v Speaker 2>western over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the bottom line is that place is the</v>

11
00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:45.560
<v Speaker 2>first time when we were done the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time he muted the live preview.</v>

12
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't hear ourselves.</v>

13
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.330
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we uh,</v>

14
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.850
<v Speaker 2>we got over there and it's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

15
00:00:55.851 --> 00:00:58.760
<v Speaker 2>we're at a place called Yas Island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a manmade island.</v>

16
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.920
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means they built an island.</v>

17
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it sinking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the one that's the one in Dubai,</v>

18
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.030
<v Speaker 2>the ones you buy the sinking is the one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a model of the world.</v>

19
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.890
<v Speaker 2>If you ever wanted to know how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>money is an oil,</v>

20
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.780
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta go to the Middle East.</v>

21
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that it's fucking staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

22
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.150
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see a shitty car while I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

23
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.890
<v Speaker 2>Everything was a fucking Mercedes.</v>

24
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a Mercedes or A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the cabs are kind of crappy,</v>

25
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.220
<v Speaker 2>but it's all for robberies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lamborghinis and these fucking </v>

26
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.610
<v Speaker 2>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They built this island.</v>

27
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:36.611
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they have this thing called </v>

28
00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:36.611
<v Speaker 2>Ferrari world and that's where the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

29
00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:37.760
<v Speaker 2>which is this crazy theme park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're building.</v>

30
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.520
<v Speaker 2>They're just building shit constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere you go.</v>

31
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 2>They're building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

32
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:44.780
<v Speaker 2>like all throughout the city of Abu </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dhabi.</v>

33
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:49.430
<v Speaker 2>It's all just skyscrapers and cranes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit going on constantly.</v>

34
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Apparently Dubai's buys even crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to fuck around with Dubai </v>

35
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.040
<v Speaker 2>dough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even want to fly in there.</v>

36
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 2>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the options was we could fly into</v>

37
00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:02.891
<v Speaker 2>Dubai and then from Dubai we would take </v>
<v Speaker 2>a car service that would take us a </v>

38
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.750
<v Speaker 2>dress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an hour and a half drive to an</v>

39
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.560
<v Speaker 2>island and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to land in Dubai,</v>

40
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.900
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

41
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.390
<v Speaker 2>I can't keep hearing crazy shit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dubai.</v>

42
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 2>I hear crazy shit about people who got </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrested because there was some sort of </v>

43
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.330
<v Speaker 2>a visa problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they drug test them.</v>

44
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.500
<v Speaker 2>They arrested this one woman for coding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is.</v>

45
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 2>She lives in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has a prescription for codeine </v>

46
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 2>because she's got a back problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got back injuries.</v>

47
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.790
<v Speaker 2>So they arrested her for this and put </v>
<v Speaker 2>her in fucking jail because she had it </v>

48
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 2>in her system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

49
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.550
<v Speaker 2>There's another guy who was traveling </v>
<v Speaker 2>there who had a speck of marijuana on </v>

50
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.910
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of his shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at the dude,</v>

51
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:41.720
<v Speaker 2>that dude was like a roster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had dreadlocks and shit and that does</v>

52
00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:46.721
<v Speaker 2>not fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you vacuum out your suitcase on my </v>

53
00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:49.610
<v Speaker 2>God that I didn't smoke pot for a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>day to day.</v>

54
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.210
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was out of my head.</v>

55
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's shit.</v>

56
00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Just that shit scares me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to be put into that </v>

57
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 2>because I've heard too many horror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a regular society.</v>

58
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's run by kings and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most part they're running just </v>

59
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.820
<v Speaker 2>like western democracy means most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

60
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 2>it's very clean and very safe and cops </v>
<v Speaker 2>are everywhere and people are polite.</v>

61
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.010
<v Speaker 2>But the bottom line is you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same sort of rights you have in </v>

62
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.010
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

63
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 2>we always want to talk about are </v>
<v Speaker 2>dwindling rights and our rights are </v>

64
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.271
<v Speaker 2>certainly dwindling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're still way better than what </v>

65
00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 2>you'd get over in Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dubai,</v>

66
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 2>you don't get shit it a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe out on the piece.</v>

67
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Now they're in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where we're making out.</v>

68
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:30.660
<v Speaker 2>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

69
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 2>they said you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to put you in jail.</v>

70
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 2>So they don't have a problem with like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

71
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:37.050
<v Speaker 2>like the ring card girl is wearing.</v>

72
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering because I didn't talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody before,</v>

73
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to wear?</v>

74
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 2>This chick's gonna wear like dresses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how weird would that be if they had</v>

75
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 2>a world like that would've been awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.690
<v Speaker 2>They gave me the dress thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

77
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.890
<v Speaker 2>the traditional garb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was a guy who does my job for </v>

78
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 2>the Arab world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very nice guy.</v>

79
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name was Muhammad and the,</v>

80
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.650
<v Speaker 2>they call them husband and they call </v>
<v Speaker 2>them Muhammad Rogan and uh,</v>

81
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.080
<v Speaker 2>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

82
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.520
<v Speaker 2>he does the whole outfit and when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>does his broadcast,</v>

83
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 2>he does this traditional Arab where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>all were.</v>

84
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like a white outfit with like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>black thing around your head and then a </v>

85
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 2>white headdress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's called but everyone.</v>

86
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Whereas there did it smell okay over </v>
<v Speaker 2>there dude,</v>

87
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 2>it's a bunch of rich people with crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>money and weird outfits,</v>

88
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.300
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

89
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 2>And I kind of liked the outfit for </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain.</v>

90
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 2>This is what I liked about the outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it because like you can't,</v>

91
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean I guess you could wear like a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch or something like that.</v>

92
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:38.191
<v Speaker 2>But like stylistically everyone looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same and there's something about </v>

93
00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something about that is dumb.</v>

94
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like you should be able to dress </v>
<v Speaker 2>and look however you want,</v>

95
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 2>but something about that is kind of cool</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's like,</v>

96
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.460
<v Speaker 2>is it really fucking important what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wear?</v>

97
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's in your head,</v>

98
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 2>it's nonsense and all this style and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like how you want to be portrayed.</v>

99
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Like have you ever seen a dude who like </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to be thought of as like a writer,</v>

100
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to be thought of as like an </v>

101
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.701
<v Speaker 2>intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's wearing like a jacket with the </v>

102
00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Elbow Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carol whack.</v>

103
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or that.</v>

104
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like just a certain amount of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretense that comes with what you were,</v>

105
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's unavoidable.</v>

106
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dress like I'm fucking 20 years old.</v>

107
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm 42 fucking years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still dress exactly the same.</v>

108
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 2>I did when I was 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at my wardrobe when I was 20</v>

109
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:24.090
<v Speaker 2>and now the only difference is I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>more clothes now.</v>

110
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have a lot of tap out shit.</v>

111
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 2>But other than that it's I fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>dressing same.</v>

112
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

113
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 2>there's something about wearing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>outfit that they're all in unity to.</v>

114
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like they all recognized like we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>all in this together,</v>

115
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Speaker 2>like we all have the same outfit on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean part of it is like,</v>

116
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.570
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be bad for like creativity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and individuality and stuff like that </v>

117
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.130
<v Speaker 2>because one of the reasons why people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>America are so creative is [inaudible].</v>

118
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.320
<v Speaker 2>If you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could put a lip ring in and fucking </v>

119
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.010
<v Speaker 2>shave half your head and paint the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>half purple and Tattoo your face.</v>

120
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:59.011
<v Speaker 2>You can do whatever the fuck you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>over here and something about that as </v>

121
00:05:59.011 --> 00:05:59.011
<v Speaker 2>good for creativity</v>

122
00:05:59.011 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 3>to the point I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also I've had jobs where I've had to</v>

123
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:06.131
<v Speaker 3>have a uniform and was so much better </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a uniform or wearing the same as </v>

124
00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:10.241
<v Speaker 3>everybody else instead of having to like</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick out a different tie every day and </v>

125
00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 3>every day for work.</v>

126
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is true,</v>

127
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.200
<v Speaker 2>but if you had to choose when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>working between having a uniform and not</v>

128
00:06:16.201 --> 00:06:17.850
<v Speaker 2>having a uniform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always going to say no.</v>

129
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.570
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

130
00:06:18.571 --> 00:06:23.571
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I like having a uniform at work </v>

131
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:23.571
<v Speaker 3>because then kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to dress up,</v>

132
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:24.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if you could drag a real job,</v>

133
00:06:24.961 --> 00:06:28.440
<v Speaker 3>and I'm talking about real world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real world in the real world.</v>

134
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.730
<v Speaker 3>We live in a fake.</v>

135
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.950
<v Speaker 2>It's not a no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is another thing though about the </v>

136
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.221
<v Speaker 2>world is that the world is so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so God damn rigid and what you're </v>

137
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:41.841
<v Speaker 2>supposed to wear and high supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>behave and how you're supposed to dress </v>

138
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:42.930
<v Speaker 2>like Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

139
00:06:42.931 --> 00:06:47.931
<v Speaker 2>That's the best way they have of </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlling people really is to make </v>

140
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:51.981
<v Speaker 2>sure that you're always going to wear </v>
<v Speaker 2>suits and ties when you go to work and </v>

141
00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:54.581
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get into this place because </v>

142
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:54.581
<v Speaker 2>you have a hat on and you know,</v>

143
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:55.690
<v Speaker 3>I hate the hat on thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So silly that.</v>

144
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean because I could understand where </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're in some parts where you're </v>

145
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.790
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

146
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.611
<v Speaker 3>that guys might get mad at the other guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're in a different gang or </v>

147
00:07:03.611 --> 00:07:04.210
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or Gotham.</v>

148
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.050
<v Speaker 3>Take your hat off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

149
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.670
<v Speaker 3>They wanted me to take off my hat and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was with you at a comedy</v>

150
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.970
<v Speaker 2>club and he works for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was ridiculous.</v>

151
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.870
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

152
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.610
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

155
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.210
<v Speaker 2>that's the most ridiculous one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strip clubs or another ridiculous thing </v>

156
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:24.210
<v Speaker 2>that happens too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to a strip club,</v>

157
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.451
<v Speaker 2>they tell you to take your hat off now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did they tell you to turn it </v>

158
00:07:28.451 --> 00:07:28.451
<v Speaker 2>around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my other favorite.</v>

159
00:07:28.451 --> 00:07:28.830
<v Speaker 2>If you were in it like I'm wearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>

160
00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:30.370
<v Speaker 2>So can you please turn your head around </v>
<v Speaker 2>sir?</v>

161
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like,</v>

162

163
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.440

<v Speaker 4>One of the funniest things ever.</v>

164
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 4>This is 100 percent true story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My ex fiance and me went to a bar once </v>

165
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.980
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we drove all the way to oxnard or </v>

166
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 4>something like that and we get there as </v>
<v Speaker 4>a friend's birthday and they're like,</v>

167
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 4>sorry sir,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't come in.</v>

168
00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:49.400
<v Speaker 4>You don't have a collar on your shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm wearing a tee shirt.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

170
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.270
<v Speaker 4>We drove an hour and a half to get here </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a friend's birthday.</v>

171
00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:58.271
<v Speaker 4>And you say I can't come in and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like all the stores around it were </v>

172
00:07:58.271 --> 00:07:58.271
<v Speaker 4>closed because it was ochsner at nine at</v>
<v Speaker 4>9:00</v>

173
00:07:58.271 --> 00:08:03.100
<v Speaker 4>PM.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I went to my car to try to find a </v>

174
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.901
<v Speaker 4>shirt and only thing could find is my ex</v>
<v Speaker 4>fiance shirt and it was like a small </v>

175
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.270
<v Speaker 4>little tiny collared shirt that he wore </v>
<v Speaker 4>for work.</v>

176
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.330
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was like fat man putting on this </v>

177
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.261
<v Speaker 4>shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't even fit it look like that </v>

178
00:08:16.261 --> 00:08:16.261
<v Speaker 4>old Chris Farley like fat man in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>jacket thing.</v>

179
00:08:16.261 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 4>Like I couldn't button it up and it had </v>
<v Speaker 4>a color this and I put the collar up and</v>

180
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 4>I seriously walked up to the door like </v>

<v Speaker 4>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They let me in wearing just a great tee </v>

184
00:08:30.361 --> 00:08:34.631
<v Speaker 4>shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I now look like a fucking freak walking </v>

185
00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:34.631
<v Speaker 4>around the Bargo Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I get a bug light and stuff.</v>

186
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.010
<v Speaker 4>Lead is the collared shirt story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like</v>

187
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.840
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that about?</v>

188
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it collar boat and no color?</v>

189
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially,</v>

190
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.500
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

191
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.530
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just take off that.</v>

192
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.690
<v Speaker 2>Just go in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ridiculous.</v>

193
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.640
<v Speaker 2>The thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

194
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.930
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East is that you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to wear that outfit.</v>

195
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 2>When they gave me the head dress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gave me one.</v>

196
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 2>When I got there I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

197
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.460
<v Speaker 2>am I going to do I wear this when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

198
00:08:56.461 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Like that would be hilarious if we did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it like that.</v>

199
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Me and Mike both work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

200
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 2>nobody had to wear it but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it people were and some people don't,</v>

201
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:07.020
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people do when you go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mall.</v>

202
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 2>So like I'd say like 30 or 40 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people were wearing it.</v>

203
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.760
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

204
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they look down on people that don't </v>

205
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.000
<v Speaker 2>wear it?</v>

206
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do get more trouble if you wear normal</v>

207
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.700
<v Speaker 2>clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

208
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

209
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

210
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe getting more triple where that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit because you're right.</v>

211
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Fuck up the whole scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

212
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Blow on the curve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

213
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:31.910
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be great because they would</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like you're wearing pajamas </v>

214
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.910
<v Speaker 2>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just be naked underneath it.</v>

215
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:32.220
<v Speaker 2>It's probably something to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>heat,</v>

216
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a really light thing and it</v>

217
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.390
<v Speaker 2>doesn't stick to you and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

218
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they're probably naked under it </v>

219
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:41.540
<v Speaker 2>if you want them to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

220
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.170
<v Speaker 2>if you want it to be naked under that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually pretty dope.</v>

221
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably perfect for that kind of </v>

222
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:48.960
<v Speaker 2>weather flapping around ball sweat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting your shoe to it.</v>

223
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.590
<v Speaker 2>It's hot as fuck over there and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even think we're in the summer,</v>

224
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.950
<v Speaker 2>but there's first of all the billions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mosquitoes there.</v>

225
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.670
<v Speaker 2>We got lucky and we didn't get hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they said you can get,</v>

226
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:03.710
<v Speaker 2>you can get fucked up like a swarm of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them like swarm on you and you'll get </v>

227
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.941
<v Speaker 2>like a thousand bikes all over you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was wasps that were flying around </v>

228
00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:11.451
<v Speaker 2>the cage at that big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was freaking out because it makes you </v>

229
00:10:11.451 --> 00:10:11.451
<v Speaker 2>realize like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Chick was all over my friend Jason and </v>

250
00:11:11.451 --> 00:11:12.540
<v Speaker 2>the team and everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

252
00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Blah Blah Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then finally like,</v>

253
00:11:15.451 --> 00:11:20.451
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>groping her and stuff and he must have </v>

254
00:11:20.451 --> 00:11:20.820
<v Speaker 2>said something to her because at the end</v>
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>

255
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.560
<v Speaker 2>you have to pay to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

256
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:24.360

<v Speaker 2>And then he doesn't know what.</v>

257
00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:25.410
<v Speaker 2>And then she gets all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nevermind.</v>

258
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.440
<v Speaker 2>And walks away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this is like a half hour of </v>

259
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 2>presale that she did to him and no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw it coming.</v>

260
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.600
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

261
00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:34.440
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is cool.</v>

262
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.060
<v Speaker 2>How much money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

263
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he just went what?</v>

264
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.200
<v Speaker 2>I cannot afford cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they are you talking about?</v>

265
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of that over in the Middle</v>

266
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.860
<v Speaker 2>East though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shits.</v>

267
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.400
<v Speaker 2>It runs rampant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>

268
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.980
<v Speaker 2>So many dudes with money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

269
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.730
<v Speaker 2>they have the biggest building in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is Dubai.</v>

270
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a half a mile high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the one that the</v>

271
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.860
<v Speaker 3>golf thing.</v>

272
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another one I think.</v>

273
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the same one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is one with a tennis tennis </v>

274
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.530
<v Speaker 2>courts architecture out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just an amazing.</v>

275
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Off the chain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

276
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.640
<v Speaker 2>They have so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have more money than you could </v>

277
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.341
<v Speaker 2>possibly imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but apparently it's all dried up </v>

278
00:12:11.341 --> 00:12:14.460
<v Speaker 2>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy now that so many people owe </v>

279
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 2>money over there and if you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go broke over there,</v>

280
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.830
<v Speaker 2>you don't go to court and file for </v>
<v Speaker 2>bankruptcy,</v>

281
00:12:18.831 --> 00:12:20.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to fucking jail,</v>

282
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.440
<v Speaker 2>they put your ass in a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put you in what's called debtors' </v>

283
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:25.900
<v Speaker 2>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And debtors prison is a,</v>

284
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.900
<v Speaker 2>something you really want to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when people are going into the hole,</v>

285
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.020
<v Speaker 2>they just drive their fucking four hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the airport and gone.</v>

286
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's Ferrari's abandoned at the </v>

287
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.031
<v Speaker 2>airport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like day people are constantly </v>

288
00:12:39.031 --> 00:12:39.580
<v Speaker 2>abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The luxury cars leaving their houses,</v>

289
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they show up to,</v>

290
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.450
<v Speaker 2>to collect money and there's no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and they're gone.</v>

291
00:12:43.451 --> 00:12:46.300
<v Speaker 2>They moved to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's been good,</v>

292
00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:46.990
<v Speaker 2>nutty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

293
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.700
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have nobody.</v>

294
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:53.701
<v Speaker 2>Shit like a indoor ski facility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can go skiing and doors.</v>

295
00:12:53.711 --> 00:12:55.200
<v Speaker 2>That's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I've seen this before,</v>

296
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.890
<v Speaker 2>apparently it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to see to believe how big it.</v>

297
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:58.320
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

298
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.790
<v Speaker 3>It's actually like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a picture of it.</v>

299
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.820
<v Speaker 3>We could probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody could probably Google it where </v>

300
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.711
<v Speaker 3>it's just like a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like slope and it's like a diamond all </v>

301
00:13:07.711 --> 00:13:07.711
<v Speaker 3>the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

302
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Go surfing indoors to somewhere there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you do?</v>

303
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:11.740
<v Speaker 2>I still don't personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

304
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

305
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:20.281
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was what the Middle East was </v>

306
00:13:20.281 --> 00:13:20.281
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

307
00:13:20.281 --> 00:13:21.070
<v Speaker 2>People were very friendly over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Food was fantastic.</v>

308
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hotels,</v>

309
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.520
<v Speaker 2>top notch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was only,</v>

310
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.760
<v Speaker 2>well I guess there were some people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were there that weren't there for the </v>

311
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:29.760
<v Speaker 2>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>

312
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:29.760
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't crowded.</v>

313
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.190
<v Speaker 3>What's illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alcohol.</v>

314
00:13:31.191 --> 00:13:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Illegal out there.</v>

315
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

316
00:13:33.141 --> 00:13:36.470
<v Speaker 2>you can't go to bars but they have bars </v>
<v Speaker 2>at your hotel,</v>

317
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.680
<v Speaker 2>but that's the only place they have bars</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in hotels.</v>

318
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.260
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot have a bar,</v>

319
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.160
<v Speaker 2>but you can have a bar inside of a hotel</v>
<v Speaker 2>for I guess for Westerners,</v>

320
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.960
<v Speaker 2>but they have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

321
00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.240
<v Speaker 2>regular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The food was great,</v>

322
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.690
<v Speaker 2>the beer was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a regular.</v>

323
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

324
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.250
<v Speaker 3>everything tastes okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it tastes like Cola and everything</v>

325
00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.260
<v Speaker 2>as Arab riding on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

326
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:03.110
<v Speaker 2>He's taken some of that for what could </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing for your scrap book,</v>

327
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.130
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you 12?</v>

328
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.080
<v Speaker 3>So that the arena was outside though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

329
00:14:10.081 --> 00:14:11.510
<v Speaker 3>There was no risk to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even,</v>

330
00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:12.340
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was outside.</v>

331
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.500
<v Speaker 2>And that was an interesting part of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

332
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.180
<v Speaker 2>because the first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

333
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.670
<v Speaker 2>was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John.</v>

334
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.270
<v Speaker 2>God dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot his last name.</v>

335
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.620
<v Speaker 2>He fought for the ultimate fighter </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

336
00:14:26.621 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 2>and Mustapha Al Turk and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first fight,</v>

337
00:14:30.401 --> 00:14:35.401
<v Speaker 2>these guys were so fucking slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were punching and as they were </v>

338
00:14:35.401 --> 00:14:39.721
<v Speaker 2>punching sweat was flying off them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were the first guys to </v>

339
00:14:39.721 --> 00:14:41.500
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they were fighting like basically</v>

340
00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:46.501
<v Speaker 2>in the sunlight and it was know fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred degrees outside and humid and </v>

341
00:14:46.501 --> 00:14:48.700
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had to affect their fight for sure.</v>

342
00:14:48.701 --> 00:14:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pace themselves,</v>

343
00:14:50.021 --> 00:14:51.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they got through it.</v>

344
00:14:51.471 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the John Madsen,</v>

347
00:14:57.051 --> 00:15:02.051
<v Speaker 2>Mustapha Turk was a fight and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>so sweaty and every time they threw </v>

348
00:15:02.051 --> 00:15:02.990
<v Speaker 2>punch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweat was fucking flying off.</v>

349
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:06.720
<v Speaker 2>And literally like they threw water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they were throwing cups of water at</v>

350
00:15:06.721 --> 00:15:06.930
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

351
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.800
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the.</v>

352
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.900
<v Speaker 2>So that's the reason why the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought Silva went into lay down the </v>

353
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:13.900
<v Speaker 2>whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

354
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I just sat there and I got to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

355
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.240
<v Speaker 2>That's a very controversial fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

356
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.300
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rewatched the fights last night.</v>

357
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 2>I rewatched a Bj Penn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankie Edgar,</v>

358
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.570
<v Speaker 2>and I rewatched a Anderson Silva and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damien Maia and the Frankie Penn,</v>

359
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Bj,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Frankie Edgar,</v>

360
00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Bj Penn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of controversy on that fight.</v>

361
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.760
<v Speaker 2>One of them is [inaudible] doug crosby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's A judge who's a friend of mine.</v>

362
00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:42.260
<v Speaker 2>I like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He scored it 45 to 50,</v>

363
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:44.780
<v Speaker 2>meaning he gave every single round to </v>
<v Speaker 2>frankie edgar.</v>

364
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Now I thought it was way closer than his</v>
<v Speaker 2>way closer than that.</v>

365
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.870
<v Speaker 2>I watched the game last night in person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

366
00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:52.010
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

367
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.420
<v Speaker 2>When I saw it in person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

368
00:15:53.421 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kid did fantastic.</v>

369
00:15:55.491 --> 00:15:57.830
<v Speaker 2>He definitely did better than anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>expected.</v>

370
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is when you're doing </v>

371
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.821
<v Speaker 2>commentary for fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically I'm just kind of explaining </v>

372
00:16:06.821 --> 00:16:08.270
<v Speaker 2>what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure to keep an italian my head,</v>

373
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.470
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm concentrating on most is </v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining things,</v>

374
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.420
<v Speaker 2>being entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

375
00:16:14.421 --> 00:16:15.740
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

376
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.690
<v Speaker 2>trying to do good commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not really scoring is done silently,</v>

377
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

378
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Scoring is done silently because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>contemplating what's,</v>

379
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 2>what's more valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

380
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.570
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it is subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to contemplate,</v>

381
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:31.730
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy throws a punch and the guy,</v>

382
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.700
<v Speaker 2>the other guy counters with a leg kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which one was harder?</v>

383
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Which one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

384
00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:40.961
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do you give it to with some people </v>

385
00:16:40.961 --> 00:16:43.331
<v Speaker 2>give the punch to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people will give the leg kick and </v>

386
00:16:43.331 --> 00:16:43.340
<v Speaker 2>in that case I could see how it would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>closer,</v>

387
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then then I thought it was when I </v>

388
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:48.880
<v Speaker 2>watched it last night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I watched the last night,</v>

389
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.520
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was three rounds to two for</v>
<v Speaker 2>bj penn.</v>

390
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:53.930
<v Speaker 2>That's what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

391
00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's been clOser ones before </v>

392
00:16:58.940 --> 00:16:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

393
00:16:58.940 --> 00:16:59.900
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have taken either way,</v>

394
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.960
<v Speaker 2>either way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't ridiculous to me that he won,</v>

395
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 2>but 45 to 50 was ridiculous and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why I say it wasn't as ridiculous</v>

396
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:09.830
<v Speaker 2>because like when I was calculating when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching it,</v>

397
00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:14.831
<v Speaker 2>like in the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lands a really nice leg kick at one </v>

398
00:17:14.831 --> 00:17:17.951
<v Speaker 2>point and then bj hits him with a punch </v>
<v Speaker 2>and bj hit him with a couple of other </v>

399
00:17:17.951 --> 00:17:21.281
<v Speaker 2>punches during the take downs and he had</v>
<v Speaker 2>pj with a few punches and one of them </v>

400
00:17:21.281 --> 00:17:22.670
<v Speaker 2>cut him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that probably affected people because</v>

401
00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:24.560
<v Speaker 2>bj had like a little mark under his </v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

402
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.660
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes judges look at that and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

403
00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:31.661
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got the best of that round just </v>

404
00:17:31.661 --> 00:17:31.661
<v Speaker 2>because a little cut sometimes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>affects them.</v>

405
00:17:31.661 --> 00:17:33.830
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so subjective man.</v>

406
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.860
<v Speaker 2>But then the second run I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bj's landed more punches.</v>

407
00:17:36.861 --> 00:17:41.861
<v Speaker 2>They're like lending more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankie's throwing more and he's moving </v>

408
00:17:41.861 --> 00:17:41.861
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's making bjj fighters fight.</v>

409
00:17:41.861 --> 00:17:46.840
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely making bj chaser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to take that into </v>

410
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:46.840
<v Speaker 2>account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's,</v>

411
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.260
<v Speaker 2>who's doing better there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's got better ring generalship or </v>

412
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.450
<v Speaker 2>control the octagon while bj's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one forcing the fight.</v>

413
00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:56.451
<v Speaker 2>He's chasing after him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but frankie is really avoiding too much </v>

414
00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:59.481
<v Speaker 2>damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the cleaner shots were </v>

415
00:17:59.481 --> 00:18:00.270
<v Speaker 2>landed by bj and then as it got into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>later rounds,</v>

416
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:05.271
<v Speaker 2>dennett seemed like frankie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only round that was really clear to </v>

417
00:18:05.271 --> 00:18:08.151
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the fourth or the fifth round </v>

418
00:18:08.151 --> 00:18:08.151
<v Speaker 2>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fifth round was clear.</v>

419
00:18:08.151 --> 00:18:08.460
<v Speaker 2>That was all edgar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took him down.</v>

420
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.460
<v Speaker 2>He landed some real good shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a good round.</v>

421
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:15.240
<v Speaker 2>It seemed like around for him where </v>
<v Speaker 2>where bj was fading every other round,</v>

422
00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 2>but the fifth was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

423
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.150
<v Speaker 2>who fucking knows?</v>

424
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like if you see a fight at </v>

425
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.621
<v Speaker 2>a cafeteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not talking about the first five </v>

426
00:18:24.621 --> 00:18:26.841
<v Speaker 2>minutes of a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about what that the end </v>

427
00:18:26.841 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 2>of the fight is dominating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very good point.</v>

428
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:28.860
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what?</v>

429
00:18:28.861 --> 00:18:31.260
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people feel like fights should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be scored that way,</v>

430
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.960
<v Speaker 2>that they're different than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than any other sport.</v>

431
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:39.110
<v Speaker 2>And at the end really is what matters </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they'd been imposing their will </v>

432
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.190
<v Speaker 2>on each other and here's the end result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The end result of 25 minutes of imposing</v>

433
00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 2>their wills with frankie edgar was </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking bj's ass,</v>

434
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.740
<v Speaker 2>set them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He led,</v>

435
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.790
<v Speaker 2>kicked him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was moving better.</v>

436
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:48.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

437
00:18:48.731 --> 00:18:49.710
<v Speaker 2>he in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

438
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 2>bj chased after him with a very few </v>
<v Speaker 2>final seconds,</v>

439
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:54.390
<v Speaker 2>but he knew that it was the final </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

440
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:59.420
<v Speaker 2>I would love to hear bj's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the type of guy to make excuses </v>

441
00:18:59.420 --> 00:18:59.420
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

442
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:01.980
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vaseline.</v>

443
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that might've been true though.</v>

444
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was true.</v>

445
00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.270
<v Speaker 2>They rub it on the guy's face and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

446
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.230
<v Speaker 2>rub it on the guy's chest and rubbed it </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the guys back.</v>

447
00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.640
<v Speaker 2>Just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's 100 percent illegal.</v>

448
00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:16.530
<v Speaker 2>And I love phil nurse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a great coach.</v>

449
00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:19.410
<v Speaker 2>I love gsp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those to both of them.</v>

450
00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:24.411
<v Speaker 2>But you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe when they say that this </v>

451
00:19:24.411 --> 00:19:27.531
<v Speaker 2>fucking witch Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy tells them to do this thing because </v>

452
00:19:27.531 --> 00:19:28.050
<v Speaker 2>he explained it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He explained to me this weekend,</v>

453
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.590
<v Speaker 2>it seems like total malarkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

454
00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:36.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's telling me that there's three </v>

455
00:19:36.591 --> 00:19:36.591
<v Speaker 2>minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a mine here,</v>

456
00:19:36.591 --> 00:19:36.591
<v Speaker 2>mine here in a mind here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's pressure,</v>

457
00:19:36.591 --> 00:19:39.540
<v Speaker 2>builds up the chain and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>release and you grab here and you press.</v>

458
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.480
<v Speaker 2>You know why that works?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works if you believe it works.</v>

459
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.940
<v Speaker 2>That's why that works and there's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit like that.</v>

460
00:19:44.941 --> 00:19:49.941
<v Speaker 2>Like I know a dude who's a chiropractor </v>
<v Speaker 2>slash healer and a lot of people swear </v>

461
00:19:52.141 --> 00:19:55.470
<v Speaker 2>by them and the reason why they swear by</v>
<v Speaker 2>them is because if you believe that what</v>

462
00:19:55.471 --> 00:20:00.471
<v Speaker 2>he's doing is going to heal you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body has amazing ability to heal </v>

463
00:20:00.471 --> 00:20:03.711
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Negative and positive thinking and </v>

464
00:20:03.711 --> 00:20:04.710
<v Speaker 2>negative and positive beliefs about your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life are without a doubt,</v>

465
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.940
<v Speaker 2>self fulfilling prophecies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can decide that your life is awesome</v>

466
00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:11.670
<v Speaker 2>and your life becomes awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if you decide that your life sucks,</v>

467
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.870
<v Speaker 2>you can decide that your healing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your heel,</v>

468
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:18.980
<v Speaker 2>you can decide that you're not in pain </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you won't be in pain and you can </v>

469
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.041
<v Speaker 2>make pain happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to like back </v>

470
00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:24.891
<v Speaker 2>shit and you know there's real injuries </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people get in car accidents and </v>

471
00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:24.891
<v Speaker 2>fucking jujitsu.</v>

472
00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:28.050
<v Speaker 2>You get your neck cranked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's also people that create back</v>

473
00:20:28.051 --> 00:20:33.051
<v Speaker 2>injuries to avoid their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they don't want to think about </v>

474
00:20:33.051 --> 00:20:33.051
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ah,</v>

475
00:20:33.051 --> 00:20:36.840
<v Speaker 2>my fucking back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that keeps them from thinking about </v>

476
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:36.840
<v Speaker 2>other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

477
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.940
<v Speaker 2>that's why they do this thing where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>press ahead and that's what that's all </v>

478
00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:41.160
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like some psychosomatic thing,</v>

479
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.360
<v Speaker 2>but it's a placebo if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

480
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:43.710
<v Speaker 2>if you believe in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

481
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.490
<v Speaker 2>it fucking works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would like anyone.</v>

482
00:20:46.491 --> 00:20:51.491
<v Speaker 2>I would like to talk to bj and find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>how was he in shape because he didn't </v>

483
00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 2>look as good as it usually looks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he didn't look fat,</v>

484
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.540
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't look as hard as he looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sanchez find the sessions feisty.</v>

485
00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.120
<v Speaker 2>He looked sculpted and this fight he had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of a belly,</v>

486
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:06.150
<v Speaker 2>like a little bit of fat on his way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe he had an injury because he </v>

487
00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:07.630
<v Speaker 2>also didn't sit down and his stool in </v>
<v Speaker 2>between rounds,</v>

488
00:21:07.631 --> 00:21:12.631
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it him that had the thing you had a </v>

489
00:21:12.631 --> 00:21:14.610
<v Speaker 2>nice sleeve on and he didn't sit down in</v>
<v Speaker 2>between rounds and which you rounds.</v>

490
00:21:14.611 --> 00:21:19.611
<v Speaker 2>He stood up and he put his leg up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put his leg up on the stool and they </v>

491
00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:19.720
<v Speaker 2>said that to him at one point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bj,</v>

492
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:20.950
<v Speaker 2>put your leg up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put your leg up.</v>

493
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.530
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know what that means.</v>

494
00:21:23.531 --> 00:21:25.540
<v Speaker 2>It could be a cramp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be nothing.</v>

495
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:26.610
<v Speaker 2>It could be.</v>

496
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.710
<v Speaker 4>It's that human and you just got done </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>

497
00:21:28.711 --> 00:21:30.000
<v Speaker 4>You're going to want to sit down and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>can.</v>

498
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think so.</v>

499
00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.320
<v Speaker 2>I would think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>

500
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.840
<v Speaker 2>but see he hasn't said a word about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>

501
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:41.080
<v Speaker 2>So I think I could easily see how </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone could give that fight to frankie</v>

502
00:21:41.571 --> 00:21:43.130
<v Speaker 2>edgar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It totally makes sense to me.</v>

503
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said like when I saw it live I was</v>

504
00:21:46.401 --> 00:21:47.720
<v Speaker 2>like man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know either way,</v>

505
00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.080
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the fight edgar was </v>
<v Speaker 2>winning the fight and like you said,</v>

506
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:54.410
<v Speaker 2>that should count more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way pride scores that the way</v>

507
00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.200
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They counted the fight as like one whole</v>

508
00:21:57.201 --> 00:21:58.490
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it should be.</v>

509
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.280
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree with you.</v>

510
00:22:01.281 --> 00:22:06.281
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think fights are not like any other </v>

511
00:22:06.281 --> 00:22:09.041
<v Speaker 2>sport and that like there was a fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>between rio shown and a brad blackburn </v>

512
00:22:09.041 --> 00:22:13.541
<v Speaker 2>once and brad blackburn was kicking his </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass for two rounds and then the third </v>

513
00:22:14.091 --> 00:22:18.950
<v Speaker 2>and final round real children came on </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong and he battered black is beat the</v>

514
00:22:18.951 --> 00:22:19.790
<v Speaker 2>fuck out of them.</v>

515
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Like really went after him and broke his</v>
<v Speaker 2>nose and he had him running from him.</v>

516
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.870
<v Speaker 2>Total domination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The third route.</v>

517
00:22:26.871 --> 00:22:31.871
<v Speaker 2>So it was so much difference between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first two rounds which are pretty close </v>

518
00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:35.201
<v Speaker 2>but blackburn was winning by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was getting his shots in but jonah and </v>

519
00:22:35.201 --> 00:22:38.461
<v Speaker 2>keep coming forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But blackburn was kicking his ass but </v>

520
00:22:38.461 --> 00:22:39.380
<v Speaker 2>then the third real China just turned it</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

521
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:42.700
<v Speaker 2>But real lost the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lost a decision because blackburn one</v>

522
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.000
<v Speaker 2>the first two rounds and I said that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first.</v>

523
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.040
<v Speaker 2>See the clearest example to me of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone won the fight but lost the fight</v>

524
00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.620
<v Speaker 2>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wanted a decision,</v>

525
00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.800
<v Speaker 2>but he lost the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was a fight.</v>

526
00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.850
<v Speaker 2>That guy lost the fight.</v>

527
00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:03.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's crazy about imagine two guys </v>

528
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:03.930
<v Speaker 4>fighting and at the last second it got </v>
<v Speaker 4>hits.</v>

529
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.040
<v Speaker 4>A guy knocks him out right when the bell</v>
<v Speaker 4>hits,</v>

530
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:11.090
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in the other guy won because he was </v>

531
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.090
<v Speaker 4>doing the rest of the fight better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

532
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.090
<v Speaker 4>But if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

533
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.380
<v Speaker 4>Like what if that were to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if that knocks him out?</v>

534
00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:13.770
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

535
00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.170
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

536
00:23:14.171 --> 00:23:16.390
<v Speaker 4>Right at the bell though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like thing bam.</v>

537
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.910
<v Speaker 4>Guy knocks out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the.</v>

538
00:23:17.911 --> 00:23:18.100
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

539
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:19.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like after the break.</v>

540
00:23:19.351 --> 00:23:24.351
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why you would say to the guy </v>

541
00:23:24.351 --> 00:23:24.351
<v Speaker 2>dropped his guard because he heard the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bill.</v>

542
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.890
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

543
00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.350
<v Speaker 4>If it was like full from that bank </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

544
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:28.220
<v Speaker 4>bonk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

545
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:28.740
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

546
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.920
<v Speaker 2>I think as long as he was already </v>
<v Speaker 2>committed to the punch before the bell </v>

547
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:33.920
<v Speaker 2>rang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

548
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.100
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

549
00:23:35.101 --> 00:23:37.770
<v Speaker 2>that would like some crazy last second </v>
<v Speaker 2>buzzer shit.</v>

550
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it.</v>

551
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Because liotta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But cheetah did that.</v>

552
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:47.810
<v Speaker 2>He'd knocked out thiago silva at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like after barbara and he put them out.</v>

553
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.780
<v Speaker 2>It was like during the horn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think going off or,</v>

554
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.310
<v Speaker 2>or very close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very close within.</v>

555
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:59.590
<v Speaker 4>Why don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So has there been any talk about taking </v>

556
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.590
<v Speaker 4>the pride rules?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

557
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.640
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

558
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.520
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to,</v>

559
00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:06.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to reason with the people that are </v>

560
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:06.600
<v Speaker 2>involved and just sanctioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to get things sanctioned.</v>

561
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:10.370
<v Speaker 2>And the thing I've said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people complained about elbows like this</v>

562
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:15.440
<v Speaker 2>elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what they call the 12 to six </v>

563
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:15.440
<v Speaker 2>elbow coming straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight down.</v>

564
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.630
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why that was made </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal was because big John Mccarthy,</v>

565
00:24:18.631 --> 00:24:22.530
<v Speaker 2>this came straight from his mouth when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was educating the commission and they</v>

566
00:24:22.531 --> 00:24:23.570
<v Speaker 2>were trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

567
00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:27.840
<v Speaker 2>legislate mixed martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people in these athletic commissions</v>

568
00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:31.170
<v Speaker 2>were worried that downward elbows on </v>
<v Speaker 2>espn at 2:00</v>

569
00:24:31.171 --> 00:24:33.270
<v Speaker 2>in the morning can break bricks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

570
00:24:33.271 --> 00:24:35.970
<v Speaker 2>there's fucking karate demonstration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were like,</v>

571
00:24:35.971 --> 00:24:38.820
<v Speaker 2>well we can't have that because you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit someone and killed them.</v>

572
00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can't do that,</v>

573
00:24:40.471 --> 00:24:43.020
<v Speaker 2>but you can still do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is more powerful.</v>

574
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.530
<v Speaker 2>I think this is less powerful than this.</v>

575
00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.320
<v Speaker 2>This right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to get more weight into it.</v>

576
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:53.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a more natural motion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is pretty strong,</v>

577
00:24:53.101 --> 00:24:58.101
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's as good as this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like hitting someone in the head </v>

578
00:24:58.101 --> 00:24:58.860
<v Speaker 2>like that is not as strong as hitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>them a lot.</v>

579
00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.890
<v Speaker 2>That was like when you turn your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>into something,</v>

580
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:06.240
<v Speaker 2>you have more power and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes more sense that this elbow,</v>

581
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.810
<v Speaker 2>the elbow that jon jones broke brand and</v>
<v Speaker 2>various eye socket with.</v>

582
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.310
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That elbow.</v>

583
00:25:11.311 --> 00:25:14.790
<v Speaker 2>That's illegal elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's powerful as fuck.</v>

584
00:25:14.791 --> 00:25:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is the other one illegal?</v>

585
00:25:17.191 --> 00:25:18.480
<v Speaker 2>And this one's legal debts.</v>

586
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.680
<v Speaker 4>I kind of get it though because there is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big reason why the ufc used to be on </v>

587
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.350
<v Speaker 4>an a vhs tape with faces of death in my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In my collection.</v>

588
00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.720
<v Speaker 4>That used to be shocking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like almost disturbing,</v>

589
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:30.100
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

590
00:25:30.101 --> 00:25:32.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to watch because it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like this guy could die,</v>

591
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.360
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

592
00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:38.480
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely agree that there should be </v>

593
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:38.480
<v Speaker 2>rules and I definitely agree this should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be sanctioning,</v>

594
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.260
<v Speaker 2>but it should be rational shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be.</v>

595
00:25:40.261 --> 00:25:42.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soccer kick people in the ground,</v>

596
00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:43.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

597
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that if a guy's on his </v>

598
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.781
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he should be able to kick you in the </v>

599
00:25:50.781 --> 00:25:50.781
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

600
00:25:50.781 --> 00:25:53.360
<v Speaker 2>If you're on your knees so loud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should still be able to kick you in </v>

601
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:53.360
<v Speaker 2>the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're punching him in the face.</v>

602
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Why can't he kick you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

603
00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.050
<v Speaker 2>If you are one nay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can blast someone in the face with a</v>

604
00:25:58.051 --> 00:26:00.360
<v Speaker 2>punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't he kick you in the face?</v>

605
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:01.920
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

606
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:02.970
<v Speaker 2>you can't move as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

607
00:26:02.971 --> 00:26:05.070
<v Speaker 2>don't be there then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

608
00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:10.220
<v Speaker 2>You're taking away a a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an important weapon for the guy in the </v>

609
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:10.220
<v Speaker 2>bottom.</v>

610
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.700
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to up kick the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of someone when they're on their </v>

611
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:13.700
<v Speaker 2>knees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that guy's trying to punch you in the</v>

612
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.171
<v Speaker 2>face and you're lying on your back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like your weight is on top of them </v>

613
00:26:18.171 --> 00:26:19.650
<v Speaker 2>like you're stomping him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're kicking from your back at him.</v>

614
00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:24.890
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to kick his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>head like a soccer ball when you're </v>

615
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:25.410
<v Speaker 2>lying on your back and a guy's on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>knees,</v>

616
00:26:25.411 --> 00:26:30.411
<v Speaker 2>on top of you trying to punch you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to kick the fuck out </v>

617
00:26:30.411 --> 00:26:33.090
<v Speaker 2>of him and it should be much more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put yourself in much more jeopardy.</v>

618
00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:35.160
<v Speaker 2>You're in much more danger when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of a guy then,</v>

619
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 2>and that's how it should be because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how it is in real life.</v>

620
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:42.900
<v Speaker 2>That's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be this unrealistic thing </v>

621
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.680
<v Speaker 2>where the guy has to be standing up over</v>
<v Speaker 2>you for you to kick in the face.</v>

622
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:44.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be.</v>

623
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 2>You could kick them as long as you're on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom.</v>

624
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:52.430
<v Speaker 2>Is there the bottom you can kick them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're on the top you can kick </v>

625
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.430
<v Speaker 2>everything except for his head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

626
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.630
<v Speaker 2>You can kick a guy in the body when he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ground,</v>

627
00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.400
<v Speaker 2>you know you can kick the guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs,</v>

628
00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:01.550
<v Speaker 2>you can kick it down to opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a downed opponents should be able to </v>

629
00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:02.280
<v Speaker 2>kick you anywhere from any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>

630
00:27:02.281 --> 00:27:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Who wants?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's legal.</v>

631
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.160
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to be changed though.</v>

632
00:27:05.161 --> 00:27:10.161
<v Speaker 2>Like gracie's never tap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on that last fight.</v>

633
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.420
<v Speaker 2>That fight that he wasn't going to tap </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

634
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.310
<v Speaker 2>That's one of those fights though that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like this.</v>

635
00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.130
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be a cut.</v>

636
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fights over because there were so many </v>

637
00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:22.220
<v Speaker 2>times where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is this guy even bother?</v>

638
00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Let's finish with the frankie edgar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fight that fight though because I think </v>

639
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.010
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scoring is a very subjective thing.</v>

640
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:34.190
<v Speaker 2>You could say the frankie edgar </v>
<v Speaker 2>outworked him because he threw more </v>

641
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:35.370
<v Speaker 2>punches and he landed leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't learn that many leg kicks.</v>

642
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:36.930
<v Speaker 2>Frankie definitely landed more leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks.</v>

643
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.480
<v Speaker 2>He mixed it up more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take down attempts so I could definitely</v>

644
00:27:39.481 --> 00:27:43.440
<v Speaker 2>see him winning the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see it being an argument because</v>

645
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:48.620
<v Speaker 2>no one can say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their opinion when something's that </v>

646
00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.321
<v Speaker 2>close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't really say that your opinions </v>

647
00:27:51.321 --> 00:27:52.110
<v Speaker 2>right or wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fifth round he won.</v>

648
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.690
<v Speaker 2>He won the fifth round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how anybody could argue that</v>

649
00:27:54.691 --> 00:27:55.900
<v Speaker 2>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But doug,</v>

650
00:27:55.910 --> 00:28:00.060
<v Speaker 2>this crosby men 50 to 45 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

651
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.160
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He must've been drunk.</v>

652
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 2>That's why the reference should be done </v>
<v Speaker 2>by a 100 people.</v>

653
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

654
00:28:07.501 --> 00:28:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I think three is too little and you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>another here's another problem.</v>

655
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the referee and should be done in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of an online thing where </v>

656
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:16.940
<v Speaker 2>people they get picked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely no,</v>

657
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.770
<v Speaker 2>like they get picked the the like </v>
<v Speaker 2>posters on message boards.</v>

658
00:28:19.771 --> 00:28:21.930
<v Speaker 2>Guys who are big fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys who really,</v>

659
00:28:21.931 --> 00:28:23.880
<v Speaker 2>really understand the sport and we do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>electronically.</v>

660
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.690
<v Speaker 2>What's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the thing that's a measures,</v>

661
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:29.460
<v Speaker 2>a tv ratings and stuff and get a nielsen</v>
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>

662
00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pick only a certain amount.</v>

663
00:28:32.851 --> 00:28:36.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it should be like millions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people means like that though.</v>

664
00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Your paper idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what the problem is,</v>

665
00:28:39.331 --> 00:28:41.190
<v Speaker 2>they all have to be there live to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

666
00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Then there's that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that argument.</v>

667
00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:46.200
<v Speaker 2>There's that live is actually not as </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

668
00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not seeing the whole thing.</v>

669
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Not seeing the whole angles and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get to see a monitors.</v>

670
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you live.</v>

671
00:28:54.241 --> 00:28:59.241
<v Speaker 2>Like when I'm doing commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got two monitors to my to my right </v>

672
00:28:59.241 --> 00:29:00.510
<v Speaker 2>and one to my left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

673
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:05.540
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of angles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes we're looking at a fight </v>

674
00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.920
<v Speaker 2>and we're watching it live through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cage and write some shit goes down,</v>

675
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:13.070
<v Speaker 2>they'll move in front of a barrier or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're moving in front of one of the </v>

676
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:16.670
<v Speaker 2>polls and I can't see shit for a second </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I have to turn to the monitor </v>

677
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:17.580
<v Speaker 2>or they're on the ground and from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>angle where I'm at,</v>

678
00:29:17.581 --> 00:29:20.310
<v Speaker 2>all I see is one the side of a person's </v>
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

679
00:29:20.311 --> 00:29:25.311
<v Speaker 2>like they're on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're on the other side of the </v>

680
00:29:25.311 --> 00:29:25.311
<v Speaker 2>octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say it.</v>

681
00:29:25.311 --> 00:29:25.470
<v Speaker 2>So I have to look to the monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the judges don't get that,</v>

682
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.500
<v Speaker 2>they don't get monitors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these guys are just watching the </v>

683
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.660
<v Speaker 2>fight as it's happening from the angle </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they get and ever.</v>

684
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:34.050
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I argued with the fucking,</v>

685
00:29:34.051 --> 00:29:36.210
<v Speaker 2>the athletic commission guy about it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

686
00:29:36.211 --> 00:29:37.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

687
00:29:37.021 --> 00:29:37.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

688
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.690
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

689
00:29:39.691 --> 00:29:41.620
<v Speaker 2>that's why we have three judges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they all have different angles.</v>

690
00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:42.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

691
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.190
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to get shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>handles,</v>

692
00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.740
<v Speaker 1>give them fucking monitors that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should have it like,</v>

693
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:55.770
<v Speaker 1>er style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the doctors are all above looking </v>

694
00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:56.370
<v Speaker 1>down at the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we are absolutely.</v>

695
00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:01.860
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is even if above you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you would really have to do is be </v>

696
00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.690
<v Speaker 1>in there and we can't have that now </v>
<v Speaker 1>above with a monitor.</v>

697
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:06.880
<v Speaker 1>The cameras are better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really watching it,</v>

698
00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.280
<v Speaker 1>watching it live is better for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>excitement.</v>

699
00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Like there's nothing that beats that </v>
<v Speaker 1>excitement.</v>

700
00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.170
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

701
00:30:13.171 --> 00:30:15.610
<v Speaker 1>and when you're there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

702
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:20.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>randy coture is stepping in to fight </v>

703
00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:21.520
<v Speaker 1>brock lesnar and the place is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>bananas.</v>

704
00:30:21.521 --> 00:30:22.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

705
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.630
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that you can't recreate that at</v>

706
00:30:25.631 --> 00:30:26.470
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at home.</v>

707
00:30:26.471 --> 00:30:29.590
<v Speaker 1>It's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're there live,</v>

708
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.160
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you're a part of history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you feel like you're a part of some</v>

709
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:34.480
<v Speaker 1>wild ass shit.</v>

710
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.660
<v Speaker 1>You know when shogun and machita fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>in montreal in may,</v>

711
00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:42.810
<v Speaker 1>that being in that arena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when those two guys step in there for </v>

712
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.571
<v Speaker 1>the rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be everyone in the </v>

713
00:30:45.571 --> 00:30:45.571
<v Speaker 1>fucking place is going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>goosebumps.</v>

714
00:30:45.571 --> 00:30:45.910
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

715
00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:47.500
<v Speaker 1>because they're going to know this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

716
00:30:47.501 --> 00:30:52.501
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys went at it for five fucking </v>

717
00:30:52.501 --> 00:30:55.200
<v Speaker 1>rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thought machida was totally </v>

718
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.091
<v Speaker 1>untouchable and then most people thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>shogun one of the decision and now </v>

719
00:30:57.091 --> 00:30:59.380
<v Speaker 1>they're going out again and live and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's happening right now.</v>

720
00:30:59.381 --> 00:31:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch it at home.</v>

721
00:31:01.081 --> 00:31:02.320
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

722
00:31:02.321 --> 00:31:04.240
<v Speaker 1>you get the commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the replays,</v>

723
00:31:04.241 --> 00:31:04.940
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

724
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.960
<v Speaker 1>get all the information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but watching it live to some special </v>

725
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.960
<v Speaker 1>crackle in the air or your front row in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle.</v>

726
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time when I watched live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched the monitors,</v>

727
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.190
<v Speaker 1>like I watch it while they're standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

728
00:31:15.191 --> 00:31:19.650
<v Speaker 1>but once it's down I'm looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>monitor and the floor.</v>

729
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.300
<v Speaker 1>You're like right there and I'm only </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a couple rows,</v>

730
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still I'm watching the monitor being</v>

731
00:31:24.521 --> 00:31:29.521
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty dope to be able to look </v>

732
00:31:29.521 --> 00:31:31.471
<v Speaker 1>through the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost worth keeping that ufc job </v>

733
00:31:31.471 --> 00:31:34.171
<v Speaker 1>just for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever get like blood splat right </v>

734
00:31:34.171 --> 00:31:34.570
<v Speaker 1>on your hit this weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

735
00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:39.580
<v Speaker 1>you hit on my arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the prelims is licking out of it.</v>

736
00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:41.590
<v Speaker 1>I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us a hot water,</v>

737
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.980
<v Speaker 1>get in my dna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a um,</v>

738
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.180
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

739
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.470
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of,</v>

740
00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.560
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of blood and a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

741
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.390
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was in the um,</v>

742
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Kelley.</v>

743
00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Matt veech fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt beach had a horrible cut.</v>

744
00:31:56.310 --> 00:32:01.310
<v Speaker 2>He had a couple of them and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>splattered they were right in front of </v>

745
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:04.050
<v Speaker 2>us and they're beating on each other and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the blood went flying.</v>

746
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.910
<v Speaker 2>So that's my take on the controversy on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the frankie edgar,</v>

747
00:32:08.911 --> 00:32:11.240
<v Speaker 2>bj penn fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think frankie edgar,</v>

748
00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:15.660
<v Speaker 2>frankie edgar flawed a hell of a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a tremendous performance.</v>

749
00:32:15.661 --> 00:32:17.850
<v Speaker 2>So super impressed with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

750
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.960
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure if I agree with the</v>

751
00:32:21.961 --> 00:32:24.120
<v Speaker 2>verdict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely don't agree with 50 45,</v>

752
00:32:24.121 --> 00:32:27.720
<v Speaker 2>but I thought it was a very close fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and obviously I'm not a judge so who the</v>

753
00:32:27.721 --> 00:32:32.721
<v Speaker 2>fuck am I to judge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I definitely could see an argument </v>

754
00:32:32.721 --> 00:32:32.721
<v Speaker 2>for frankie winning it.</v>

755
00:32:32.721 --> 00:32:33.240
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he put on a tremendous fight.</v>

756
00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:36.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean really impressive and definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>one the last round.</v>

757
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:39.290
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at it in terms of like we</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

758
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:41.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that's the way it should be that</v>

759
00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.160
<v Speaker 2>though the guy winds at last round wins </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight.</v>

760
00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:44.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

761
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:49.810
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've imposed their will upon each </v>

762
00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:51.761
<v Speaker 2>other and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end result is after all this time </v>

763
00:32:51.761 --> 00:32:53.990
<v Speaker 2>this guy's dominating the other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but cafeteria rules.</v>

764
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:59.050
<v Speaker 2>Then there's another school of thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you have to take the champions </v>

765
00:32:59.050 --> 00:32:59.570
<v Speaker 2>title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I don't really agree with.</v>

766
00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:03.470
<v Speaker 2>I think the decision should be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you go in neutral.</v>

767
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.050
<v Speaker 2>I think when a guy's a champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go in neutral,</v>

768
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're both go in neutral.</v>

769
00:33:07.671 --> 00:33:08.910
<v Speaker 2>And if the champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

770
00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.730
<v Speaker 2>if you win the decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the new champion.</v>

771
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:12.530
<v Speaker 2>If he wins the decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a new champion.</v>

772
00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:15.020
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>domination,</v>

773
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:16.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's what leads to like shitty</v>

774
00:33:16.671 --> 00:33:19.370
<v Speaker 2>decisions where a guy really does beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>the champion,</v>

775
00:33:19.371 --> 00:33:21.890
<v Speaker 2>but he only agism and then he never gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

776
00:33:21.891 --> 00:33:26.891
<v Speaker 2>You never get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are frustrating as fuck because </v>

777
00:33:26.891 --> 00:33:26.891
<v Speaker 2>you think he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he did it.</v>

778
00:33:26.891 --> 00:33:28.910
<v Speaker 2>The other problem with the frankie edgar</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

779
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:29.780
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

780
00:33:29.781 --> 00:33:33.640
<v Speaker 2>an interesting point is that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching a guy who you think is going to</v>

781
00:33:33.641 --> 00:33:35.480
<v Speaker 2>get his ass kicked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

782
00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:40.550
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people thought frankie edgar </v>

783
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:40.550
<v Speaker 2>was going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

784
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 2>bj penn is the greatest lightweight of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>

785
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Frankie edgar got beat by gray maynard </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

786
00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:49.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way this guy's going to beat </v>

787
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:49.610
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

788
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:49.610
<v Speaker 2>So people think that because he's doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

789
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.990
<v Speaker 2>he's winning like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing better than I thought it was.</v>

790
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.480
<v Speaker 2>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>

791
00:33:53.481 --> 00:33:54.720
<v Speaker 2>he's beating him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's beating them.</v>

792
00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.220
<v Speaker 2>But when you go back and you watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's so much more with so </v>

793
00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.250
<v Speaker 2>much pressure to be a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much pressure.</v>

794
00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.580
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When bj penn beat matt hughes,</v>

795
00:34:04.581 --> 00:34:08.780
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed matt after the fight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>matt said that he was relieved.</v>

796
00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just all the groups were honest.</v>

797
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.960
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what it's like to be a </v>

798
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:16.960
<v Speaker 2>champion and everybody's gone in after </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

799
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.510
<v Speaker 2>He goes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To be honest with you,</v>

800
00:34:17.511 --> 00:34:19.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm really relieved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was really like,</v>

801
00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.800
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very impressed with his honesty.</v>

802
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:23.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very honest thing to say,</v>

803
00:34:23.901 --> 00:34:25.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>

804
00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.590
<v Speaker 2>you just fought and you're standing </v>
<v Speaker 2>there covered in sweat naked in front of</v>

805
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.670
<v Speaker 2>the fucking whole world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

806
00:34:29.671 --> 00:34:30.470
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm relieved.</v>

807
00:34:30.471 --> 00:34:32.540
<v Speaker 2>I just lost right now I can catch a </v>
<v Speaker 2>breath,</v>

808
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:33.230
<v Speaker 2>relax.</v>

809
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.820
<v Speaker 2>And then it came back and won the title </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

810
00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think he learned from the </v>

811
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.101
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a tremendous amount of </v>

812
00:34:42.101 --> 00:34:45.431
<v Speaker 2>pressure for guys to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight and defend the title and to </v>

813
00:34:45.431 --> 00:34:49.121
<v Speaker 2>always worry about defending the title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in something like mixed </v>

814
00:34:49.121 --> 00:34:49.520
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's probably a tremendous amount</v>

815
00:34:49.521 --> 00:34:52.790
<v Speaker 2>of pressure if you're a fucking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball team,</v>

816
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending their,</v>

817
00:34:54.011 --> 00:34:59.011
<v Speaker 2>their world championship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a fighter would use always guys </v>

818
00:34:59.011 --> 00:35:03.130
<v Speaker 2>coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gunning for you and every time </v>

819
00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:06.401
<v Speaker 2>you watch a ufc there's some new </v>
<v Speaker 2>murderer who's head kick and dudes into </v>

820
00:35:06.401 --> 00:35:10.391
<v Speaker 2>a fucking coma and he wants to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same shit to you and he's talking shit </v>

821
00:35:10.391 --> 00:35:10.970
<v Speaker 2>about you calling you a faggot and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

822
00:35:10.971 --> 00:35:12.770
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus christ,</v>

823
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys get that.</v>

824
00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.980
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're so god damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive.</v>

825
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Is that what's going on right now with </v>
<v Speaker 2>tito and adele,</v>

826
00:35:18.021 --> 00:35:18.410
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

827
00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.910
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it seems like a fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting chocolate dough.</v>

828
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not five chuckled though.</v>

829
00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Chuck liddell is going to be fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>rich franklin.</v>

830
00:35:26.061 --> 00:35:31.061
<v Speaker 2>And I can only say this because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>officially been released and was on the </v>

831
00:35:31.061 --> 00:35:32.330
<v Speaker 2>ufc is website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say why.</v>

832
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.890
<v Speaker 2>And they've been going back and forth on</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>

833
00:35:33.891 --> 00:35:35.340
<v Speaker 2>I've been noticing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of getting.</v>

834
00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that all all come out.</v>

835
00:35:37.981 --> 00:35:40.260
<v Speaker 2>What happened in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk about it though.</v>

836
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.580
<v Speaker 2>It's um.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

837
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:44.790
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

838
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:46.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

839
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.820
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that.</v>

840
00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

841
00:35:50.221 --> 00:35:52.680
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when dudes are defending their title,</v>

842
00:35:52.681 --> 00:35:57.681
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of emotions at </v>
<v Speaker 2>state and I think that's one of the </v>

843
00:35:57.681 --> 00:36:00.741
<v Speaker 2>things that people have taken to </v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration with this anderson silva </v>

844
00:36:00.741 --> 00:36:00.741
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

845
00:36:00.741 --> 00:36:03.720
<v Speaker 2>anderson silva,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's angry at him and every.</v>

846
00:36:03.721 --> 00:36:08.721
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't very disappointing fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because the first two rounds </v>

847
00:36:08.721 --> 00:36:10.350
<v Speaker 2>he looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fucking Bruce Lee.</v>

848
00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:15.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like ridiculous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was eat that flying knee that he hit </v>

849
00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:15.360
<v Speaker 2>him with the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

850
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:17.670
<v Speaker 2>jesus christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's just going to steam roll this guy.</v>

851
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.490
<v Speaker 2>He's just going to keep doing this until</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy just crumbles.</v>

852
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.390
<v Speaker 2>It's just gonna keep attacking at will </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's breaking this dudes will.</v>

853
00:36:24.391 --> 00:36:29.391
<v Speaker 2>It was totally humiliating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that the emotion of </v>

854
00:36:29.391 --> 00:36:33.830
<v Speaker 2>defending the title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emotion and the pressure of being </v>

855
00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.280
<v Speaker 2>regarded as the best pound for pound </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter in the world,</v>

856
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.740
<v Speaker 2>I think that's an insane amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure.</v>

857
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.920
<v Speaker 2>I think it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think when damien maia said shit </v>

858
00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.071
<v Speaker 2>to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm like take one of his arms home </v>

859
00:36:46.071 --> 00:36:46.071
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

860
00:36:46.071 --> 00:36:49.370
<v Speaker 2>henderson got fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then when he was in there after the </v>

861
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:52.401
<v Speaker 2>first rain after is kicking his ass and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the second round is just start just </v>

862
00:36:52.401 --> 00:36:53.550
<v Speaker 2>talking mad shit and yelling at them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>portuguese.</v>

863
00:36:53.551 --> 00:36:55.210
<v Speaker 2>I wish I understood what the fuck you.</v>

864
00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.530
<v Speaker 4>It's not been translated yet.</v>

865
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:59.550
<v Speaker 2>Well some people have given a rough </v>
<v Speaker 2>translations of it on the internet,</v>

866
00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:01.470
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know how you could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>

867
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.470
<v Speaker 2>I've watched the fight and I've turned </v>
<v Speaker 2>the volume of way up.</v>

868
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.370
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to discern what he's saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's no microphone on him.</v>

869
00:37:08.371 --> 00:37:09.660
<v Speaker 2>He's not miked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Headphones,</v>

870
00:37:09.661 --> 00:37:11.400
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the crowd is screaming,</v>

871
00:37:11.401 --> 00:37:13.590
<v Speaker 2>cheering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're talking over him.</v>

872
00:37:13.591 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So me and mike were talking like,</v>

873
00:37:15.211 --> 00:37:17.400
<v Speaker 2>what is he saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when he's going nuts,</v>

874
00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:20.580
<v Speaker 2>screaming and yelling at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you have headphones on,</v>

875
00:37:20.581 --> 00:37:25.260
<v Speaker 2>I think it would still be hard screaming</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yelling at a damien maia and I guess</v>

876
00:37:25.261 --> 00:37:28.980
<v Speaker 2>he was calling them like a spoiled rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid or something like that.</v>

877
00:37:28.981 --> 00:37:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Like does damien miles like kim's for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better upbringing?</v>

878
00:37:32.671 --> 00:37:37.671
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's your jujitsu now is another </v>

879
00:37:37.671 --> 00:37:37.671
<v Speaker 2>thing that people are speculating who </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying like,</v>

880
00:37:37.671 --> 00:37:38.580
<v Speaker 2>where's your jujitsu?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's it?</v>

881
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.840
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then kicks up.</v>

882
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Where did you get to</v>

883
00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:42.200
<v Speaker 4>see?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have a problem with it.</v>

884
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:47.290
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm not on the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That gain is on and everyone else's on </v>

885
00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:47.840
<v Speaker 4>with it because I don't care about like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a respect thing to me.</v>

886
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:50.690
<v Speaker 4>If he can play fucking air guitar in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ring,</v>

887
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:53.510
<v Speaker 4>you're putting up against somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not.</v>

888
00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:58.540
<v Speaker 4>That shouldn't be there like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you put him in with our caprock </v>

889
00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.110
<v Speaker 4>that's just attacking him where he </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have a chance to do all this fun</v>

890
00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:03.200
<v Speaker 4>shit in the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that's different than that guy just</v>

891
00:38:03.201 --> 00:38:05.840
<v Speaker 4>go into his back every time because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to get do jujitsu.</v>

892
00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

893
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:07.150
<v Speaker 4>if he doesn't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

894
00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.070
<v Speaker 4>he was laying on his back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He kept on going to his back to me.</v>

895
00:38:10.071 --> 00:38:11.810
<v Speaker 4>I was like to his</v>

896
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:14.760
<v Speaker 2>back as he failed to take down and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to do that.</v>

897
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:18.090
<v Speaker 2>He asked to fall backwards because if he</v>
<v Speaker 2>moves forwards is going to get punted.</v>

898
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:21.290
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really when,</v>

899
00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:26.310
<v Speaker 2>when you pull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you shoot on a guy and you don't </v>

900
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:28.641
<v Speaker 2>get to take down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens is like say say you shoot </v>

901
00:38:28.641 --> 00:38:28.641
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy who tried to get ahold of them,</v>

902
00:38:28.641 --> 00:38:32.780
<v Speaker 2>he sprawls you have to follow it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When a guy sprawls he kicks his legs </v>

903
00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.030
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he kicks his legs back,</v>

904
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:36.760
<v Speaker 2>you have to follow his legs with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs to try to stay a hold of them.</v>

905
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But of course anderson knew this was </v>

906
00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:43.351
<v Speaker 2>gonna happen and anderson is so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more explosive and so much faster than </v>

907
00:38:43.351 --> 00:38:43.351
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

908
00:38:43.351 --> 00:38:43.351
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I've always said,</v>

909
00:38:43.351 --> 00:38:46.360
<v Speaker 4>I think he's in the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I think he's just seeing this shit.</v>

910
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:51.420
<v Speaker 4>Like he can see something going on five </v>
<v Speaker 4>seconds before it happens and then I </v>

911
00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:51.420
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

912
00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:51.730
<v Speaker 4>you got to get somebody that's in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>matrix.</v>

913
00:38:51.731 --> 00:38:54.190
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how come he couldn't keep up</v>

914
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.230
<v Speaker 2>doing that because he didn't do that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fourth round.</v>

915
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Fourth round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got fucking pumped.</v>

916
00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.630
<v Speaker 2>The fourth or the fifth you got hit with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big ass lefthand,</v>

917
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:00.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

918
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:06.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he got stopped doing it because </v>

919
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:08.721
<v Speaker 4>he'd heard what all that people booing </v>
<v Speaker 4>adam and probably dana minded like got </v>

920
00:39:08.721 --> 00:39:10.050
<v Speaker 4>up and left or something crazy like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

921
00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:11.030
<v Speaker 4>He probably is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>

922
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:16.100
<v Speaker 4>I guess I have to get out of this matrix</v>
<v Speaker 4>for awhile and be somebody that I'm not </v>

923
00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:20.290
<v Speaker 4>fucking you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look how smooth and calm he was </v>

924
00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:24.230
<v Speaker 4>up to about the fourth one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it seems like something happened </v>

925
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:25.170
<v Speaker 4>between the third and the fourth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was yelled at or something like that.</v>

926
00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.110
<v Speaker 2>You got tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened.</v>

927
00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.490
<v Speaker 2>He got tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're outside.</v>

928
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:30.950
<v Speaker 2>It's super humid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hot as fuck.</v>

929
00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.220
<v Speaker 2>It's first time fighting outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

930
00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:39.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's gotten two rounds of clowning in </v>

931
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.030
<v Speaker 2>right now and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all that energy that he,</v>

932
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:43.040
<v Speaker 2>he expended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could not keep up that kind of pace.</v>

933
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:47.300
<v Speaker 2>He was winning the fight based on sheer </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosion and absolutely,</v>

934
00:39:47.301 --> 00:39:49.940
<v Speaker 2>totally avoiding any damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is his style.</v>

935
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.780
<v Speaker 2>But then he got hit when he got hit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the third round,</v>

936
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:54.920
<v Speaker 2>the fourth round rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a fourth of the fifth.</v>

937
00:39:54.921 --> 00:39:57.230
<v Speaker 2>He got hit with a big left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he shut down.</v>

938
00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.010
<v Speaker 2>You haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

939
00:39:58.011 --> 00:40:00.650
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he really decided like,</v>

940
00:40:00.651 --> 00:40:02.060
<v Speaker 2>I forget my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get hurt here,</v>

941
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

942
00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.410
<v Speaker 2>and he's tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

943
00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he just decided to keep moving.</v>

944
00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:10.840
<v Speaker 2>I really do think that's what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the fifth round he didn't do </v>

945
00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:10.880
<v Speaker 2>jack shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

946
00:40:10.881 --> 00:40:15.881
<v Speaker 2>and there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was one segment where he was </v>

947
00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:16.820
<v Speaker 2>standing over maya and maya was throwing</v>
<v Speaker 2>bombs that I'm from his knees.</v>

948
00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Mine was throwing punches from his knees</v>
<v Speaker 2>and mine was just trying to fucking kill</v>

949
00:40:21.561 --> 00:40:22.850
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just couldn't connect to them.</v>

950
00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:28.060
<v Speaker 2>And in that kind of exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally anderson just lights dudes up,</v>

951
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:33.370
<v Speaker 2>that kind of exchange of guys coming and</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking and bombing and he doesn't </v>

952
00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:34.240
<v Speaker 2>counter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't encountering he,</v>

953
00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:35.600
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's tired.</v>

954
00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.250
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

955
00:40:37.251 --> 00:40:38.870
<v Speaker 2>And now I don't hear a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying this.</v>

956
00:40:38.871 --> 00:40:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I think in the fourth and fifth rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was tired.</v>

957
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I think he was too tired to fight at his</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal pace,</v>

958
00:40:45.831 --> 00:40:50.240
<v Speaker 2>which is his explosion inside and </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside his speed that he uses.</v>

959
00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:53.330
<v Speaker 2>He's lightening fast math really dives </v>
<v Speaker 2>in like that.</v>

960
00:40:53.331 --> 00:40:58.331
<v Speaker 2>He's so much faster than everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the keys to his </v>

961
00:40:58.331 --> 00:40:58.331
<v Speaker 2>countering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when he got tired,</v>

962
00:40:58.331 --> 00:41:00.080
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't as fast anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just wasn't.</v>

963
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:03.800
<v Speaker 2>He lost a lot of esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think he decided to just coast.</v>

964
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:04.640
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

965
00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:05.870
<v Speaker 2>I want this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

966
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:06.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna</v>

967
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.940
<v Speaker 4>do you think that's his fault for being </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to coast?</v>

968
00:41:09.941 --> 00:41:11.380
<v Speaker 4>It's a good point because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean brocklin,</v>

969
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.590
<v Speaker 4>unless somebody coast for two to three </v>
<v Speaker 4>rounds,</v>

970
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:15.450
<v Speaker 4>neither would um,</v>

971
00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.550
<v Speaker 2>fader fader would put a guy out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>

972
00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:20.920
<v Speaker 2>it would find the guy and put a put feta</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

973
00:41:20.921 --> 00:41:24.190
<v Speaker 2>is not afraid to get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson never gets hit or gets faced,</v>

974
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:29.191
<v Speaker 2>bust it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the brett rogers fight like </v>

975
00:41:29.191 --> 00:41:29.191
<v Speaker 2>right on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like first round,</v>

976
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:34.320
<v Speaker 2>first minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got hit with a big jab and his nose </v>

977
00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.721
<v Speaker 2>broke open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a cut on his nose going into the </v>

978
00:41:36.721 --> 00:41:36.721
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson never gets caught.</v>

979
00:41:36.721 --> 00:41:41.490
<v Speaker 2>He gets hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got hit more on the damien mind </v>

980
00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:44.130
<v Speaker 2>either that I ever recall him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He definitely got hit harder when davy </v>

981
00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:44.130
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one,</v>

982
00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:49.290
<v Speaker 2>a animated gif online that someone found</v>
<v Speaker 2>of damien maia stepping in and,</v>

983
00:41:50.101 --> 00:41:55.101
<v Speaker 2>and cracking silver with a big fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>lefthand and it really hit them square </v>

984
00:41:55.101 --> 00:41:57.350
<v Speaker 2>and silver wobbled and moved away and </v>
<v Speaker 2>started dancing.</v>

985
00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the guy who got hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

986
00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:02.780
<v Speaker 2>I was tired and got hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he fucked around too much in the</v>

987
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.220
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He blew a ton of energy.</v>

988
00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 2>We're outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's humid.</v>

989
00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.690
<v Speaker 2>And then I think psychologically he </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts thinking,</v>

990
00:42:08.691 --> 00:42:10.760
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

991
00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:13.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm acting like an asshole and screaming</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yelling at this guy,</v>

992
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.960
<v Speaker 2>and then he stand in front of the dude </v>
<v Speaker 2>clown,</v>

993
00:42:14.961 --> 00:42:19.961
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get cracked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I think he just decided to </v>

994
00:42:19.961 --> 00:42:19.961
<v Speaker 2>move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fuck this.</v>

995
00:42:19.961 --> 00:42:20.800
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan still.</v>

996
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:22.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what happened.</v>

997
00:42:22.881 --> 00:42:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything,</v>

998
00:42:23.901 --> 00:42:28.901
<v Speaker 2>he learned his lesson and in this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like all these people are </v>

999
00:42:28.901 --> 00:42:28.901
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1000
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.460
<v Speaker 2>blaming him for this and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't see it.</v>

1001
00:42:31.461 --> 00:42:33.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why isn't the other guy,</v>

1002
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:35.240
<v Speaker 2>the other guy let him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do all of this.</v>

1003
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>

1004
00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:39.230
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a historic ufc.</v>

1005
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.770
<v Speaker 2>He was the headline fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the goals of course,</v>

1006
00:42:42.771 --> 00:42:47.771
<v Speaker 2>besides winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>winning is the number one goal for a </v>

1007
00:42:47.771 --> 00:42:47.771
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the other goal is to entertain.</v>

1008
00:42:47.771 --> 00:42:52.300
<v Speaker 2>You have to realize that you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>partnership with the ufc and the ufc </v>

1009
00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:56.051
<v Speaker 2>sales paper view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they say sell paper view on is </v>

1010
00:42:56.051 --> 00:42:58.070
<v Speaker 2>based on how impressive and exciting </v>
<v Speaker 2>your performance.</v>

1011
00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you see,</v>

1012
00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.000
<v Speaker 2>when you play easy and you just run </v>
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>

1013
00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:02.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an attack,</v>

1014
00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.690
<v Speaker 2>he could have finished that guy off in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>second round.</v>

1015
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:06.820
<v Speaker 2>He could've maybe finished him off even </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the third round.</v>

1016
00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:11.940
<v Speaker 2>He had just put himself in danger and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not willing to put himself in any </v>

1017
00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.180
<v Speaker 2>danger and he's a well calculated </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>

1018
00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:17.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't see the argument for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

1019
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:20.620
<v Speaker 2>for what he did in the fourth round and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fifth round,</v>

1020
00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:23.080
<v Speaker 2>adults see an argument for because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do shit.</v>

1021
00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.210
<v Speaker 2>He didn't attack it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't fight.</v>

1022
00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:27.370
<v Speaker 2>He literally didn't fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he couldn't,</v>

1023
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:28.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1024
00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:34.460
<v Speaker 2>he definitely couldn't fight the way he </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought in the first two rounds and he's </v>

1025
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:38.341
<v Speaker 2>not willing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at this point in time with all </v>

1026
00:43:38.341 --> 00:43:40.261
<v Speaker 2>the pressure on him being widely </v>
<v Speaker 2>regarded as the best pound for pound </v>

1027
00:43:40.261 --> 00:43:40.810
<v Speaker 2>fighter in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not willing to get an exchange.</v>

1028
00:43:40.811 --> 00:43:41.690
<v Speaker 2>You get cracked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1029
00:43:41.691 --> 00:43:44.080
<v Speaker 2>it's got a tremendous use for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1030
00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:46.480
<v Speaker 2>I see the entertainment thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also say,</v>

1031
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:48.760
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this entertainment part going?</v>

1032
00:43:48.761 --> 00:43:50.590
<v Speaker 2>Make me lose this fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if it is,</v>

1033
00:43:50.591 --> 00:43:52.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1034
00:43:52.901 --> 00:43:57.901
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's definitely some worry </v>

1035
00:43:57.901 --> 00:43:57.901
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he definitely was worried about,</v>

1036
00:43:57.901 --> 00:44:02.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he was tired and if he was going to </v>

1037
00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:03.160
<v Speaker 2>those fourth and fifth rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that makes sense to me is</v>

1038
00:44:03.161 --> 00:44:08.161
<v Speaker 2>that he moved around because he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like he could fight at the pace </v>

1039
00:44:08.161 --> 00:44:08.161
<v Speaker 2>that he fought before.</v>

1040
00:44:08.161 --> 00:44:08.950
<v Speaker 2>And when that guy hit him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1041
00:44:08.951 --> 00:44:10.180
<v Speaker 2>you don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a game.</v>

1042
00:44:10.181 --> 00:44:12.490
<v Speaker 2>I could get hurt here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could lose and I would look completely</v>

1043
00:44:12.491 --> 00:44:14.310
<v Speaker 2>retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's just around.</v>

1044
00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll throw some faint,</v>

1045
00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:18.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll move around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you guys that have attacked him.</v>

1046
00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't.</v>

1047
00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.260
<v Speaker 2>The bottom line with them in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My has tremendous heart,</v>

1048
00:44:23.261 --> 00:44:27.460
<v Speaker 2>but his striking is so below what </v>
<v Speaker 2>anderson's is,</v>

1049
00:44:27.461 --> 00:44:32.461
<v Speaker 2>the only way it's gonna work is if </v>
<v Speaker 2>anderson's really tired and wasn't </v>

1050
00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:33.450
<v Speaker 2>willing to stand in front of him when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's really tired.</v>

1051
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.660
<v Speaker 2>So who do you think silver can fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would just change the game.</v>

1052
00:44:36.661 --> 00:44:39.450
<v Speaker 2>The guy would come in there who won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>let silva do any of this shit.</v>

1053
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people say vitor belfort,</v>

1054
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.780
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with vito belfort is </v>
<v Speaker 2>vituro has had some very uneven </v>

1055
00:44:48.001 --> 00:44:53.001
<v Speaker 2>performances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes he just looks like </v>

1056
00:44:53.001 --> 00:44:53.001
<v Speaker 2>unstoppable.</v>

1057
00:44:53.001 --> 00:44:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Like against rich franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1058
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:58.670
<v Speaker 2>against vandelay silva.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes charging out in the first </v>

1059
00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:00.801
<v Speaker 2>round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes I forget sakharova things </v>

1060
00:45:00.801 --> 00:45:02.400
<v Speaker 2>don't go his way and he kind of shuts </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and guys wind up beating his ass.</v>

1061
00:45:02.401 --> 00:45:07.401
<v Speaker 2>Like he broke his hand into sakharova </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight early and you could see him like </v>

1062
00:45:07.401 --> 00:45:08.940
<v Speaker 2>totally shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And soc robin just kicked his ass,</v>

1063
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:10.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the randy couture torrified,</v>

1064
00:45:10.631 --> 00:45:15.631
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Randy coture just broke up and got on </v>

1065
00:45:15.631 --> 00:45:15.631
<v Speaker 2>top of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just beat him up.</v>

1066
00:45:15.631 --> 00:45:16.800
<v Speaker 2>And his first fight with randy couture </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's third fight,</v>

1067
00:45:16.801 --> 00:45:19.150
<v Speaker 2>the second fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but stop really quickly because it.</v>

1068
00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.750
<v Speaker 2>Randy had a cut on his eyelid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is eyelid opened up?</v>

1069
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Like it was like split in the it like he</v>
<v Speaker 2>got greg glanced with a punch and then </v>

1070
00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:31.611
<v Speaker 2>vito became the champ for one fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when randy beat him up in the </v>

1071
00:45:31.611 --> 00:45:32.820
<v Speaker 2>rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>randy gun on top of him just broke them,</v>

1072
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1073
00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:38.220
<v Speaker 2>if guys put a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure on him in the past,</v>

1074
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.810
<v Speaker 2>they've been able to break him.</v>

1075
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:45.260
<v Speaker 2>But the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other argument to that as he was </v>

1076
00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:45.260
<v Speaker 2>going through a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal problems back then,</v>

1077
00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:45.750
<v Speaker 2>he's a different guy now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

1078
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:50.770
<v Speaker 2>his sister had been abducted and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kidnapped and killed and he was really </v>

1079
00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:51.440
<v Speaker 2>devastated for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1080
00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:56.450
<v Speaker 2>and that he's over that now and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very religious and more at peace with </v>

1081
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:59.631
<v Speaker 2>himself and more like in tune.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his last few performances has been </v>

1082
00:45:59.631 --> 00:46:01.230
<v Speaker 2>staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the matt lindland destruction,</v>

1083
00:46:01.231 --> 00:46:06.231
<v Speaker 2>he destroyed matt lindland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked outstanding and then he came </v>

1084
00:46:06.231 --> 00:46:07.320
<v Speaker 2>to the ufc and destroyed rich franklin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he looks scary as fuck.</v>

1085
00:46:07.321 --> 00:46:08.930
<v Speaker 2>And anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1086
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:12.150
<v Speaker 2>did not want that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were talking mad shit to each other</v>

1087
00:46:12.151 --> 00:46:17.151
<v Speaker 2>and they were at anderson's manager was </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to say that victoria doesn't </v>

1088
00:46:17.151 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 2>deserve the title fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you talking about?</v>

1089
00:46:18.301 --> 00:46:20.910
<v Speaker 2>He's the scariest motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One 85 besides anderson.</v>

1090
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:23.520
<v Speaker 2>Of course he deserves it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they wanted that fight.</v>

1091
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:24.690
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1092
00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:29.830
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can talk all the shit they want </v>

1093
00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:29.830
<v Speaker 2>about him being weak and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he tours week and he breaks mentally,</v>

1094
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:35.570
<v Speaker 2>he comes at you in that first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to fight him before you break </v>

1095
00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:35.570
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1096
00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:38.670
<v Speaker 2>And before you break them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's throwing lightspeed fucking barrage</v>

1097
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:40.560
<v Speaker 2>of punches like no one else in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

1098
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.790
<v Speaker 2>He's scary as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if he really is a better,</v>

1099
00:46:44.791 --> 00:46:49.791
<v Speaker 2>more mature person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it really is more centered now and </v>

1100
00:46:49.791 --> 00:46:52.581
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to break and really is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like at home with themselves and really </v>

1101
00:46:52.581 --> 00:46:56.570
<v Speaker 2>his problems in the past where he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through a lot of emotional and </v>

1102
00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:58.911
<v Speaker 2>personal problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those have actually made him </v>

1103
00:46:58.911 --> 00:46:58.911
<v Speaker 2>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's the case,</v>

1104
00:46:58.911 --> 00:47:01.200
<v Speaker 2>everybody's fucked because that guy's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>freak.</v>

1105
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:06.350
<v Speaker 2>He so fucking fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might be the only guy that's faster </v>

1106
00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:10.041
<v Speaker 2>than anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a counter striker and he's not as </v>

1107
00:47:10.041 --> 00:47:13.131
<v Speaker 2>long as anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anderson would have a little bit of </v>

1108
00:47:13.131 --> 00:47:15.380
<v Speaker 2>advantage and a reach advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but goddamn v towards fastest fuck </v>

1109
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:17.940
<v Speaker 2>athlete John Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a freak to to put John Jones is two.</v>

1110
00:47:17.941 --> 00:47:22.941
<v Speaker 2>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John jones can't make one 80 foot gsp </v>

1111
00:47:22.941 --> 00:47:23.070
<v Speaker 2>versus silicon that ever happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was going to happen.</v>

1112
00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.050
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was going,</v>

1113
00:47:25.051 --> 00:47:25.950
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll never do that.</v>

1114
00:47:25.951 --> 00:47:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Now they can't trust anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they can't trust him to perform.</v>

1115
00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.200
<v Speaker 2>And this is what I was saying before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why this fight was so important.</v>

1116
00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.240
<v Speaker 2>This is why they're so pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1117
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.740
<v Speaker 2>Because the last two rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1118
00:47:35.741 --> 00:47:40.741
<v Speaker 2>him just running away the ufc his own 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of his own by flash </v>

1119
00:47:41.651 --> 00:47:44.020
<v Speaker 2>entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the royal family in abu dhabi.</v>

1120
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:46.450
<v Speaker 2>And this was like a huge showcase for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1121
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.630
<v Speaker 2>This was like their big acquisition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1122
00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:53.410

<v Speaker 2>to help bring the ufc to all these world</v>

1123
00:47:53.411 --> 00:47:56.710
<v Speaker 2>markets all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everyone's all excited about this.</v>

1124
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.840
<v Speaker 2>So then they have this huge event where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a $3 million dollar gate,</v>

1125
00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:04.060
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Everybody was super fucking rowdy.</v>

1130
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.250

<v Speaker 2>penn,</v>

1131
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:20.170

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was some wild ass flights </v>

<v Speaker 2>The crowd is height to the gills.</v>

1138
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Anderson silva comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go fucking crazy.</v>

1139

<v Speaker 2>You see him dance dancing.</v>

1141
00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:46.690
<v Speaker 2>They're going fucking bananas and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>runs for the last two rounds and dude,</v>

1142
00:48:46.811 --> 00:48:49.950
<v Speaker 2>it was a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody walked out of there with their</v>

1143
00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.940
<v Speaker 2>head hung,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaking their head going,</v>

1144
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:54.190
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was disappointed.</v>

1145
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:56.950
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was two arguments.</v>

1146
00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Some people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1147
00:48:58.331 --> 00:48:59.830
<v Speaker 2>I see his point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why take a chance?</v>

1148
00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:04.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was bummed out what the ufc </v>

1149
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.681
<v Speaker 2>cells is just wild shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're selling wild fucking chaos fights</v>

1150
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:14.580
<v Speaker 2>the most exciting sport in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What anderson silva is selling is he's </v>

1151
00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:18.841
<v Speaker 2>the very best at the wild shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile he didn't do it the last two </v>

1152
00:49:18.941 --> 00:49:20.110
<v Speaker 2>rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just ran away.</v>

1153
00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:25.330
<v Speaker 2>That's terrible for the business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible for what the ufc is trying</v>

1154
00:49:25.331 --> 00:49:26.950
<v Speaker 2>to accomplish in other countries.</v>

1155
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:30.190
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible for the new partnership </v>
<v Speaker 2>with flash entertainment.</v>

1156
00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:35.350
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But have a ufc outside and all the </v>

1157
00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:36.010
<v Speaker 2>fighters be added their helmet to it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1158
00:49:36.011 --> 00:49:38.380
<v Speaker 2>But it's even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're both out of their element.</v>

1159
00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're also.</v>

1160
00:49:39.821 --> 00:49:41.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just different,</v>

1161
00:49:41.381 --> 00:49:43.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like one who has fun and he was,</v>

1162
00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:45.700
<v Speaker 2>he was fighting though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was cool down.</v>

1163
00:49:45.701 --> 00:49:47.500
<v Speaker 2>It cooled down to like maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>

1164
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.060
<v Speaker 2>but the first guy's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1165
00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:53.470
<v Speaker 2>john madsen and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and staff.</v>

1166
00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll turn those motherfuckers fought in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a sauna.</v>

1167
00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Which you think about that gracie fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1168
00:49:56.921 --> 00:49:58.270
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was awful.</v>

1169
00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:03.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanzo hadn't trained for two and a half </v>

1170
00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:03.390
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1171
00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:07.020
<v Speaker 2>That's a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said it didn't train at all this what </v>

1172
00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:07.020
<v Speaker 2>he said in the post fight interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he,</v>

1173
00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trained for six months for the fight and</v>

1174
00:50:08.831 --> 00:50:09.640
<v Speaker 2>it just wasn't enough.</v>

1175
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Matt hughes for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had been looking to knock somebody </v>

1176
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:14.910
<v Speaker 2>out forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for him it was,</v>

1177
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:19.410
<v Speaker 2>it was an awesome opportunity to finally</v>
<v Speaker 2>get someone who's going to stand in </v>

1178
00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:19.410
<v Speaker 2>front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1179
00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:19.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like legs and.</v>

1180
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he like,</v>

1181
00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:25.290
<v Speaker 2>kicked the shit out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was going to take them </v>

1182
00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:25.290
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought he would beat him from the top</v>

1183
00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:29.280
<v Speaker 2>because matthew is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though a kenzo has really good </v>

1184
00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.310
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu is very underrated and he's just</v>

1185
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.410
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strong.</v>

1186
00:50:31.411 --> 00:50:32.150
<v Speaker 2>And his wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1187
00:50:32.151 --> 00:50:37.151
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did the hoist when he got him on the </v>

1188
00:50:37.151 --> 00:50:38.681
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't land through voice when he </v>

1189
00:50:38.681 --> 00:50:38.681
<v Speaker 2>got him on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1190
00:50:38.681 --> 00:50:39.410
<v Speaker 2>he's strong as fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just think,</v>

1191
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:40.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1192
00:50:40.251 --> 00:50:45.251
<v Speaker 2>it had been more exciting if they went </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the ground now there were both would </v>

1193
00:50:45.251 --> 00:50:46.290
<v Speaker 2>have been in their element instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a sloppy kickboxing.</v>

1194
00:50:46.291 --> 00:50:47.330
<v Speaker 2>He was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1195
00:50:47.331 --> 00:50:49.390
<v Speaker 2>It looked like ultimate fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the first episode.</v>

1196
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:50.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1197
00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1198
00:50:51.321 --> 00:50:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the tv show.</v>

1199
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:53.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1200
00:50:53.551 --> 00:50:54.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so much.</v>

1201
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:59.400
<v Speaker 2>They're mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're both doing things they're not </v>

1202
00:50:59.400 --> 00:50:59.400
<v Speaker 2>good at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you and I were going to have a</v>

1203
00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.400
<v Speaker 2>one on one game of basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1204
00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:01.540
<v Speaker 5>We pulled that.</v>

1205
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:03.900
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1206
00:51:03.901 --> 00:51:06.740
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they both had a um,</v>

1207
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.090
<v Speaker 2>if they try to take each other down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1208
00:51:09.091 --> 00:51:10.350
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how to ground battle,</v>

1209
00:51:10.351 --> 00:51:12.900
<v Speaker 2>that would have been exciting as fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>for matthew's notes.</v>

1210
00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:16.020
<v Speaker 2>It was a smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had an advantage standing up and plus</v>

1211
00:51:16.021 --> 00:51:18.210
<v Speaker 2>no one's going to take him down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very tough to take that guy.</v>

1212
00:51:18.211 --> 00:51:21.900
<v Speaker 2>But you gotta be like gsp to take matt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was down so he wasn't gonna take them</v>

1213
00:51:21.901 --> 00:51:22.770
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And matt,</v>

1214
00:51:22.771 --> 00:51:24.210
<v Speaker 2>he's felt like he had an advanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing,</v>

1215
00:51:24.211 --> 00:51:25.890
<v Speaker 2>so beat him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what he did.</v>

1216
00:51:25.891 --> 00:51:30.891
<v Speaker 2>He beat him up with leg kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow them down and then eventually </v>

1217
00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:31.200
<v Speaker 2>planted them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1218
00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:33.660
<v Speaker 2>I think matthew is still has a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights in them.</v>

1219
00:51:33.661 --> 00:51:38.661
<v Speaker 2>If he wants to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still a lot of good matchup for </v>

1220
00:51:38.661 --> 00:51:38.661
<v Speaker 2>him if he really gets motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's gonna fight like that</v>

1221
00:51:38.661 --> 00:51:43.611
<v Speaker 2>with that many people though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his decision to stand up with </v>

1222
00:51:43.611 --> 00:51:45.000
<v Speaker 2>him was purely based on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He felt like he had an advantage in that</v>

1223
00:51:45.001 --> 00:51:45.510
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

1224
00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.000
<v Speaker 5>It needs to change his opening song </v>
<v Speaker 5>already.</v>

1225
00:51:48.001 --> 00:51:51.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm done with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh goddamn class.</v>

1226
00:51:55.990 --> 00:52:00.990
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you said that your mother </v>

1227
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:02.481
<v Speaker 5>fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying that you know it's done </v>

1228
00:52:02.481 --> 00:52:06.681
<v Speaker 5>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think my favorite fights are the </v>

1229
00:52:06.681 --> 00:52:09.720
<v Speaker 5>japanese do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not fighting anymore of the ufc </v>

1230
00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.991
<v Speaker 5>because he lost the last one where he </v>
<v Speaker 5>dresses up and he has fun with the </v>

1231
00:52:11.991 --> 00:52:12.900
<v Speaker 5>opening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the japanese guy.</v>

1232
00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:18.000
<v Speaker 5>He is my favorite man when he's a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish they would.</v>

1233
00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:19.920
<v Speaker 5>There's no chance he's ever coming back </v>
<v Speaker 5>to usc.</v>

1234
00:52:19.921 --> 00:52:23.140
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll really go almost still pretty young</v>

1235
00:52:23.141 --> 00:52:24.400
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked him.</v>

1236
00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:25.740
<v Speaker 5>He's one of my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Loves this song.</v>

1237
00:52:25.741 --> 00:52:26.340
<v Speaker 5>Motherfucker.</v>

1238
00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:36.720
<v Speaker 5>A great goddamn song.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you never wanted to live in the woods</v>

1239
00:52:39.301 --> 00:52:44.301
<v Speaker 5>like this motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked it the first 500 times I'm </v>

1240
00:52:44.301 --> 00:52:45.630
<v Speaker 5>hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a shit when he comes out to</v>

1241
00:52:45.631 --> 00:52:50.631
<v Speaker 5>that bucket to come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Son isn't the greatest walkout music </v>

1242
00:52:50.631 --> 00:52:52.490
<v Speaker 5>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my opinion.</v>

1243
00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:55.690
<v Speaker 5>There's no better walk out music and </v>
<v Speaker 5>this song.</v>

1244
00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.720
<v Speaker 5>No better match.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't,</v>

1245
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:59.070
<v Speaker 5>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's better?</v>

1246

<v Speaker 5>It's perfect for him.</v>

1247
00:53:05.290 --> 00:53:07.530

<v Speaker 5>I'm always about mixing it up.</v>

1248

<v Speaker 5>song.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>

1250
00:53:13.291 --> 00:53:15.790

<v Speaker 5>Plus the ufc owns outside.</v>

1251
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:18.020
<v Speaker 5>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They bought the rights to.</v>

1252
00:53:18.021 --> 00:53:21.100
<v Speaker 5>That's really because of the med schools</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they can use the.</v>

<v Speaker 5>the point is though,</v>

1310
00:55:32.651 --> 00:55:33.340
<v Speaker 5>the more they do it</v>

1311
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:37.710
<v Speaker 2>more grows and the more it becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the culture and it's 12 months a</v>

<v Speaker 2>They go to la once a year,</v>

1320
00:55:51.831 --> 00:55:54.560
<v Speaker 2>every two years or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say we've got too many places to go.</v>

1321
00:55:54.561 --> 00:55:58.400
<v Speaker 2>We gotta go to fucking Germany and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ireland and Australia.</v>

1322
00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:00.920
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1323
00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:03.330
<v Speaker 5>the wec went to Ohio this year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

1324
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:08.570
<v Speaker 5>but why do you have to go to Afghanistan</v>
<v Speaker 5>and why don't you just go to Ohio </v>

1325
00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:09.300
<v Speaker 5>because they want to take over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

1326
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:11.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1328
00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:16.020
<v Speaker 5>very undersold when they first came into</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ufc.</v>

1329
00:56:16.021 --> 00:56:20.100
<v Speaker 5>The ufc had insane potential but very </v>
<v Speaker 5>little coverage.</v>

1330
00:56:20.101 --> 00:56:21.360
<v Speaker 5>Very few people know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When,</v>

1331
00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:24.460
<v Speaker 5>when I first started working for the ufc</v>
<v Speaker 5>was in 1997</v>

1332
00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.860
<v Speaker 2>and that the company that I worked for </v>
<v Speaker 2>was seg,</v>

1333
00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:30.340
<v Speaker 2>a much smaller company than the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now zuph.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We did shows in like little fucking high</v>

<v Speaker 2>loved the sport to come in there and </v>

1342
00:56:54.481 --> 00:56:56.200
<v Speaker 2>just shoving in front of people's faces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it on tv,</v>

1343
00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:58.750

<v Speaker 2>huge.</v>

1344
00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.670

<v Speaker 2>gonna happen.</v>

1345
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.260
<v Speaker 2>But that is what happened with zoo fa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened is these guys had owned 22</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be crazy to get that </v>

<v Speaker 5>It's like you would go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1357
00:57:30.161 --> 00:57:30.490

<v Speaker 2>then they took over.</v>

1363
00:57:42.591 --> 00:57:45.380
<v Speaker 2>But they realized when they took over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once it started taking off,</v>

1364
00:57:45.381 --> 00:57:47.240
<v Speaker 2>after the ultimate fighter tv show </v>
<v Speaker 2>started airing,</v>

1365
00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:51.920

<v Speaker 2>in America was exposure.</v>

1366
00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.520
<v Speaker 2>And this is a sport that transcends </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural boundaries,</v>

<v Speaker 2>in America.</v>

1371

<v Speaker 2>sophisticated.</v>

1373

<v Speaker 5>horrible.</v>

1519
01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:03.510

<v Speaker 2>She had a sexual relationship with her </v>

1522
01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:11.231
<v Speaker 2>dad like her whole life and her dad shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>her up with heroin or with cocaine when </v>

1523
01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:14.330
<v Speaker 2>she was 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And her.</v>

1525
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:19.310
<v Speaker 2>Her dad shut her up with coke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1526
01:04:19.311 --> 01:04:24.311
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing is just the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrific thing you could ever possibly </v>

1527
01:04:24.311 --> 01:04:27.980
<v Speaker 2>imagine that someone would do this to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their kid and fuck their kid their whole</v>

1528
01:04:27.981 --> 01:04:30.020
<v Speaker 2>life had a sexual relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their kid.</v>

1529
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:32.030
<v Speaker 2>It to the point where she told her like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1530
01:04:32.031 --> 01:04:37.031
<v Speaker 2>we could leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you go to countries where this is </v>

1531
01:04:37.031 --> 01:04:37.031
<v Speaker 2>totally acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what country is he going to go to?</v>

1532
01:04:37.031 --> 01:04:38.990
<v Speaker 2>What country is it acceptable to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>your kids?</v>

1533
01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Is there one out there now that should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be just death?</v>

1534
01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>

1535
01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:45.630
<v Speaker 2>Nice to be death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1536
01:04:45.631 --> 01:04:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking of death,</v>

1537
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:52.150
<v Speaker 2>the catholic religion is fighting to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to impose a statute of </v>

1538
01:04:52.541 --> 01:04:57.541
<v Speaker 2>limitations on sexual molestation cases </v>
<v Speaker 2>because right now there's a statute of </v>

1539
01:04:57.541 --> 01:04:59.420
<v Speaker 2>limitations on sexual molestation cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

1540
01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:04.750
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's like 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're trying to impose a,</v>

1541
01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:10.790
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to make sure that that </v>

1542
01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:10.790
<v Speaker 2>sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1543
01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:10.790
<v Speaker 2>they want to make sure that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1544
01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:14.950
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't change it to no statute of </v>

1545
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:16.130
<v Speaker 2>limitations because then anytime someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a case right now,</v>

1546
01:05:16.131 --> 01:05:19.390
<v Speaker 2>if a case is more than 30 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 30 years.</v>

1547
01:05:19.930 --> 01:05:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure the case is more than 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

1548
01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:25.510
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to be a part of a case,</v>

1549
01:05:25.511 --> 01:05:28.270
<v Speaker 2>you have to be joining with other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>

1550
01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:33.271
<v Speaker 2>that are also inside the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So say if someone has a case that's 29 </v>

1551
01:05:33.271 --> 01:05:35.320
<v Speaker 2>years old and yours is 30 and the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>priest buck to you,</v>

1552
01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:36.520
<v Speaker 2>then you can join in.</v>

1553
01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.500
<v Speaker 2>But if yours is the individual case </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1554
01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:43.510
<v Speaker 2>they're saying you don't want you to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to sue.</v>

1555
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:44.650
<v Speaker 2>And people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1556
01:05:44.651 --> 01:05:45.850
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

1557
01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:50.940
<v Speaker 2>And meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the catholic church is urging people to </v>

1558
01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:51.760
<v Speaker 2>vote against this because they're saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's an assault on the church.</v>

1559
01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:57.060
<v Speaker 2>How is pedophiles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is shielding pedophiles with a </v>

1560
01:05:57.281 --> 01:06:02.281
<v Speaker 2>statute of limitations?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How has that fucking helping the church </v>

1561
01:06:02.281 --> 01:06:05.540
<v Speaker 2>and how would getting rid of any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any statute of limitations that would </v>

1562
01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:10.410
<v Speaker 2>impose a timeline for when you can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>prosecuted for a horrible crime against </v>

1563
01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:12.130
<v Speaker 2>humanity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could that be what god wants?</v>

1564
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:13.250
<v Speaker 2>That god wants you to</v>

1565
01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:14.530
<v Speaker 5>sick of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

1566
01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>

1567
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.330

<v Speaker 5>I was thinking about today.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you can't talk about it.</v>

1571

<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I can tell you that I unfaced bucked</v>

<v Speaker 5>that I could no longer be an uncle </v>

1574
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:35.740
<v Speaker 5>because I on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's only two times be an uncle </v>

1575
01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:35.740

<v Speaker 5>She's not allowing me.</v>

1576
01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:40.600
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's all stand would be an uncle to my </v>

1577
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:40.600
<v Speaker 5>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How sure I am.</v>

1578
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:44.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm the uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his uncle.</v>

1579
01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:50.350
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a two times that I've gotten </v>

1580
01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:51.950
<v Speaker 5>into such a huge fight with my sister.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Both of these times.</v>

1581
01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.300
<v Speaker 5>It rooted from religion.</v>

1582
01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1583
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:59.230
<v Speaker 2>I met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People want to believe that there are </v>

1584
01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:00.340
<v Speaker 2>some rules and regulations to the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it makes them feel better.</v>

1585
01:07:00.341 --> 01:07:02.020
<v Speaker 2>And when you come along and say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>

1586
01:07:02.021 --> 01:07:04.030
<v Speaker 2>that they don't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it makes them.</v>

1587
01:07:04.070 --> 01:07:09.070
<v Speaker 2>We have to reevaluate their whole life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they fucking hate it and they get </v>

1588
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:09.430
<v Speaker 2>angry at you because you're fucking up </v>
<v Speaker 2>their piece.</v>

1589
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.490
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have developed a piece of mine from</v>

1590
01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:15.100
<v Speaker 2>the idea that god is great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god is good,</v>

1591
01:07:15.101 --> 01:07:20.101
<v Speaker 2>and you do the right things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to go to heaven like that </v>

1592
01:07:20.101 --> 01:07:20.101
<v Speaker 2>helps them get through the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1593
01:07:20.101 --> 01:07:22.570
<v Speaker 2>And for a lot of people it's a nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple box to put the world at.</v>

1594
01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:22.980
<v Speaker 2>And when you</v>

1595
01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:24.850
<v Speaker 5>go fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a fucking box look,</v>

1596
01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:30.940
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want that box back.</v>

1597
01:07:30.941 --> 01:07:35.941
<v Speaker 5>Then it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the real problem is when anybody </v>

1598
01:07:35.941 --> 01:07:37.870
<v Speaker 5>tells you that they know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's when the problem came over.</v>

1599
01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.730
<v Speaker 5>Game over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1600
01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:41.930
<v Speaker 5>you can't.</v>

1601
01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.300

<v Speaker 2>What is good?</v>

1610
01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:04.250
<v Speaker 2>When people offer advice and people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I've learned from my </v>

<v Speaker 2>I learned to look in the mirror.</v>

<v Speaker 1>look at my own life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>abu dhabi.</v>

1637
01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:00.480

<v Speaker 1>I hope none of these motherfuckers have </v>

1638
01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:00.480

<v Speaker 3>I had an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has this odd cdd,</v>

1646
01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.140
<v Speaker 3>can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remixes,</v>

1647
01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:23.650
<v Speaker 3>remixes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remix the bits into like,</v>

1648
01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:25.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're kids,</v>

1651
01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:32.350
<v Speaker 1>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was what I was worried.</v>

1652
01:09:32.530 --> 01:09:34.480
<v Speaker 1>If you don't not familiar with any of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>

1653
01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:38.170
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called shiny happy jihad.</v>

1654
01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:43.320
<v Speaker 1>And it's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you see that was the just.</v>

1655

1656
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:50.710
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1657
01:09:50.711 --> 01:09:54.370
<v Speaker 1>that's probably one of my best cds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's my favorite.</v>

1658
01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last one is really good too.</v>

1659
01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:59.590
<v Speaker 1>The last one's a little heavier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one's a little sillier,</v>

1660
01:09:59.730 --> 01:10:01.720
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my favorites.</v>

1661
01:10:01.721 --> 01:10:02.680
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

1662
01:10:02.681 --> 01:10:07.681
<v Speaker 1>I hope none of these motherfuckers have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this because like half of the bits are </v>

1663
01:10:07.681 --> 01:10:11.551
<v Speaker 1>about suicide bombing and fucking making</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun of osama bin ladin living in a cave.</v>

1664
01:10:12.911 --> 01:10:13.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of,</v>

1665
01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:14.770
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them.</v>

1666
01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that in there.</v>

1667
01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Some guy remix that jihad and made a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible song out of it.</v>

1668
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:29.430
<v Speaker 1>I still think you need to work on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>new song that you wrote in tempe.</v>

1669
01:10:29.431 --> 01:10:33.210

1830
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I just want to push a button so I got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>digital recorder when I drive,</v>

1831
01:17:14.151 --> 01:17:15.080
<v Speaker 2>I come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you drive?</v>

<v Speaker 4>we talked about this last week to the </v>

<v Speaker 4>point where like I have to get my words </v>
<v Speaker 4>out as quick as possible.</v>

1836
01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:29.060
<v Speaker 4>It happened to me like two days after </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I had thought of this hilarious </v>

1837
01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:29.060
<v Speaker 4>thing about metallica.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pete,</v>

01:17:34.330 --> 01:17:36.060
<v Speaker 4>Lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't even remember what it is.</v>

1844
01:17:36.061 --> 01:17:37.230
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying to think about it all </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1845
01:17:37.231 --> 01:17:39.180
<v Speaker 4>Was so fucking funny though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even remember it.</v>

1846
01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's when someone's talking to you and </v>

1847
01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:44.460
<v Speaker 2>you have an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can totally lose it.</v>

1848
01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll get ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

1849
01:17:46.090 --> 01:17:49.020
<v Speaker 2>I will cover my ears and run away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1850
01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:50.950
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man?</v>

1851
01:17:50.951 --> 01:17:55.951
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking rude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I have to come back and explain to </v>

1852
01:17:55.951 --> 01:17:58.471
<v Speaker 2>them I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had an idea and it was super </v>

1853
01:17:58.471 --> 01:17:59.790
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for me any idea like that is like,</v>

1854
01:17:59.830 --> 01:18:04.830
<v Speaker 2>those are diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's ideas that have come up </v>

1855
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:04.830
<v Speaker 2>with like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1856
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:05.530
<v Speaker 2>that became bits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1857
01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:08.730
<v Speaker 2>that those pits are so valuable to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1858
01:18:08.731 --> 01:18:09.190
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1859
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:11.440
<v Speaker 2>like my Anna Nicole Smith bed or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1860
01:18:11.441 --> 01:18:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Like some of the classic bits that I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past.</v>

1861
01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:14.980
<v Speaker 2>What if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I was thinking that up,</v>

1862
01:18:14.981 --> 01:18:17.770
<v Speaker 2>somebody came up to me and started </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about their stupid bullshit,</v>

1863
01:18:17.771 --> 01:18:22.771
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because some people are fucking brutal </v>

1864
01:18:22.771 --> 01:18:25.141
<v Speaker 2>and they don't take the hint ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they just want to say what they </v>

1865
01:18:25.141 --> 01:18:25.150
<v Speaker 2>have to say to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say,</v>

1866
01:18:25.151 --> 01:18:26.200
<v Speaker 2>can you hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second.</v>

1867
01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:27.280
<v Speaker 2>They'll just keep talking.</v>

1868
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:28.850
<v Speaker 4>Hold on a second dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop.</v>

1869
01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:30.570
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

1870
01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:33.920
<v Speaker 4>And then I was watching the ufc next to </v>
<v Speaker 4>a guidance.</v>

1871
01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:36.860
<v Speaker 4>I just met with a friend of a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the whole fight,</v>

1872
01:18:36.861 --> 01:18:41.060
<v Speaker 4>he sounded like a reporter from the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 4>twenties talking to dick tracy.</v>

1873
01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:42.870
<v Speaker 4>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything about that yet.</v>

1874
01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:44.900
<v Speaker 4>So when you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1875
01:18:44.901 --> 01:18:45.990
<v Speaker 4>even talk like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

1876
01:18:45.991 --> 01:18:47.860
<v Speaker 4>that's funny thing about his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think as long as I can.</v>

1877
01:18:48.210 --> 01:18:49.070
<v Speaker 4>And I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1878
01:18:49.071 --> 01:18:53.790
<v Speaker 4>shut the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're like,</v>

1879
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:57.720
<v Speaker 4>I hate when people don't have that </v>
<v Speaker 4>quality of self evaluated.</v>

1880
01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:02.800
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That just drives me crazy when I meet </v>

1881
01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:02.800
<v Speaker 4>somebody that does.</v>

1882
01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:02.800
<v Speaker 2>How important is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1883
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:06.220
<v Speaker 2>we know a lot of people that don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that quality.</v>

1884
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:08.920
<v Speaker 2>We know a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people don't have that quality.</v>

1885
01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a bad quality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the usually the people at this is</v>

1886
01:19:11.801 --> 01:19:16.801
<v Speaker 2>another thing that people don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that quality are usually not successful </v>

1887
01:19:16.801 --> 01:19:17.360
<v Speaker 2>and it's one of the reasons why they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not successful is there.</v>

1888
01:19:17.361 --> 01:19:22.361
<v Speaker 2>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a disconnect between them and </v>

1889
01:19:22.361 --> 01:19:25.651
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other people do not see them the way </v>

1890
01:19:25.651 --> 01:19:28.180
<v Speaker 2>everybody else does or them the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather they see themselves,</v>

1891
01:19:28.181 --> 01:19:33.181
<v Speaker 2>they see themselves like completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>distorted and that's why they haven't </v>

1892
01:19:33.181 --> 01:19:36.421
<v Speaker 2>been successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not being objective because </v>

1893
01:19:36.421 --> 01:19:37.000
<v Speaker 2>objectivity requires pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1894
01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:38.500
<v Speaker 2>No one's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1895
01:19:38.501 --> 01:19:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not making mistakes,</v>

1896
01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.060
<v Speaker 2>you're not trying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not trying,</v>

1897
01:19:43.061 --> 01:19:44.440
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get better at </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything you do.</v>

1898
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:45.250
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna fuck up.</v>

1899
01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:47.170
<v Speaker 2>You're going to make horrible mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1900
01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:52.380
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons I got good at standup</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because being bad at standup is so </v>

1901
01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:52.380
<v Speaker 2>fucking painful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1902
01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:57.211
<v Speaker 2>and the only way you got to find that </v>
<v Speaker 2>out by getting in front of people and </v>

1903
01:19:57.211 --> 01:19:58.060
<v Speaker 2>having them hate you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having them not laugh and believe,</v>

1904
01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:00.460
<v Speaker 2>well a lot of people don't have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience in their life.</v>

1905
01:20:00.490 --> 01:20:05.490
<v Speaker 2>They don't have anything to evaluate </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves with so they don't evaluate </v>

1906
01:20:05.490 --> 01:20:08.821
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have this distorted perception </v>

1907
01:20:08.821 --> 01:20:09.030
<v Speaker 2>of how cool you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's with guys and drinking.</v>

1908
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.440
<v Speaker 2>That's the most painful.</v>

1909
01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:12.510
<v Speaker 1>The mouse drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1910
01:20:12.511 --> 01:20:14.940
<v Speaker 1>It's your worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been,</v>

1911
01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made it,</v>

1912
01:20:15.751 --> 01:20:20.751
<v Speaker 1>I've done it before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've also like the next day slapped </v>

1913
01:20:20.751 --> 01:20:20.751
<v Speaker 1>my forehead going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1914
01:20:20.751 --> 01:20:22.770
<v Speaker 1>next time I drink I got to remember that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do that.</v>

1915
01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1916
01:20:23.690 --> 01:20:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's some people,</v>

1917
01:20:24.991 --> 01:20:27.210
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to guys get really close </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your face when they're drunk.</v>

1918
01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Some dude did that in and other job and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he kept telling me that he was some </v>

1919
01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.970
<v Speaker 1>prince's cousin and this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then men,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was you and I are going to open up.</v>

1924
01:20:42.301 --> 01:20:45.040

<v Speaker 1>It's chicken.</v>

1929
01:20:59.131 --> 01:21:04.131
<v Speaker 1>My Mike Young used to do a joke about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of my favorite bits about </v>

1930
01:21:04.131 --> 01:21:06.540
<v Speaker 1>how everybody does coke wants to open up</v>
<v Speaker 1>a business with you because it's totally</v>

1931
01:21:06.541 --> 01:21:08.250
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When dudes do coke,</v>

1932
01:21:08.251 --> 01:21:10.880
<v Speaker 1>they always have business plans because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have all kinds of plants.</v>

1933
01:21:10.890 --> 01:21:13.800
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1934
01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:17.850
<v Speaker 1>coke is the worst drug in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the worst drugs ever been created?</v>

1935
01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:23.140
<v Speaker 1>It is the number one retailer drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no better when you're out and </v>

1936
01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:24.880
<v Speaker 1>you're surrounded by a bunch of coke </v>
<v Speaker 1>cans and they're just talking out.</v>

1937
01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Know the worst is when you're high and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're cooked up.</v>

1938
01:21:28.081 --> 01:21:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Is there ever a worse combination?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no worse combination.</v>

1939
01:21:31.711 --> 01:21:36.711
<v Speaker 1>Then when you're stoned and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging around coke heads because stone </v>

1940
01:21:36.711 --> 01:21:38.340
<v Speaker 1>is like you're timid and you're humble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1941
01:21:38.341 --> 01:21:39.660
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you smoke pot,</v>

1942
01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:40.950
<v Speaker 1>you all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start realizing like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean they've done.</v>

1971

<v Speaker 2>that in the past.</v>

1974
01:22:55.991 --> 01:22:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Like soldiers have told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been told that they have to take certain</v>

2025
01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:13.000

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2033
01:25:30.370 --> 01:25:31.690
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no food.</v>

2041
01:25:47.170 --> 01:25:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Let's find a story right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what happened was apparently he </v>

2042
01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:53.470
<v Speaker 1>had some chick that was working for him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was his.</v>

2043
01:25:54.670 --> 01:25:56.000
<v Speaker 1>She was his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2044
01:25:56.260 --> 01:26:00.640
<v Speaker 1>he's sued for trafficking women and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual assault trafficking women.</v>

2045
01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:03.950
<v Speaker 1>The woman was a former model and she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>hired the actor</v>

2046
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.590
<v Speaker 2>as his executive assistant last </v>
<v Speaker 2>february.</v>

2047
01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:08.090
<v Speaker 2>This was on tmz.</v>

2051
01:26:17.301 --> 01:26:22.301
<v Speaker 2>seven days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So apparently one of the assistants quit</v>

2052
01:26:22.730 --> 01:26:26.630
<v Speaker 2>and seagal apparently only roles with </v>
<v Speaker 2>threesomes.</v>

2053
01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:30.260
<v Speaker 2>So he made his uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So it's not outside the realm of </v>

2091
01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:06.611
<v Speaker 2>possibility that some actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just hired two of them like to be on </v>

01:28:13.611 --> 01:28:15.020
<v Speaker 2>You use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't really criticize it.</v>

2098
01:28:15.230 --> 01:28:16.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can criticize the fact that he's a,</v>

2099
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:19.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's hiring prostitutes,</v>

2100
01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:21.230

<v Speaker 2>rich?</v>

01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:37.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of them think he's hot because </v>

2109
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:40.151
<v Speaker 2>he's rich?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many super goofy looking dudes that </v>

2110
01:28:40.151 --> 01:28:41.390
<v Speaker 2>are multibillionaires who have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>model wives.</v>

2111
01:28:41.391 --> 01:28:45.130
<v Speaker 2>He's super fucking hot wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on there?</v>

2112
01:28:45.190 --> 01:28:46.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump,</v>

2113
01:28:46.401 --> 01:28:48.500
<v Speaker 2>you ever see donald trump's wife hot as </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

2114
01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a powerful man and all that good </v>

2115
01:28:53.650 --> 01:28:53.650
<v Speaker 2>stuff and they're attracted to that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>security and all that good stuff.</v>

2116
01:28:53.650 --> 01:28:56.000
<v Speaker 2>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is rich.</v>

2117
01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:57.530
<v Speaker 2>They're hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's ugly.</v>

2118
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:59.430
<v Speaker 2>What's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2119
01:28:59.450 --> 01:29:01.530
<v Speaker 2>this is a form of prostitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2120
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.080
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2121
01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the sexual prostitution is the </v>

2122
01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:08.240
<v Speaker 1>whole difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that in sexual prostitution?</v>

2123
01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.120
<v Speaker 1>So apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2124
01:29:09.150 --> 01:29:12.270
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that it's not good because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no love,</v>

2125
01:29:12.330 --> 01:29:14.520
<v Speaker 1>there's no real emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no relationship,</v>

2126
01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:17.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just sex for money.</v>

2127
01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:22.460
<v Speaker 1>But like what if you like data girl and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually enjoy her company and need </v>

2128
01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:25.620
<v Speaker 1>your time and you like her and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2129
01:29:26.190 --> 01:29:28.230
<v Speaker 1>you have a shitty job and I have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of money.</v>

2130
01:29:28.290 --> 01:29:33.290
<v Speaker 1>How about you quit your job and I pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>you a thousand dollars a week and this </v>

2131
01:29:33.290 --> 01:29:36.621
<v Speaker 1>is what you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to suck my dick anytime I </v>

2132
01:29:36.621 --> 01:29:36.621
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2133
01:29:36.621 --> 01:29:36.621
<v Speaker 1>you already liked to do it anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2134
01:29:36.621 --> 01:29:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Well let's just make it sort of a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2135
01:29:37.801 --> 01:29:40.290
<v Speaker 1>And you'll get a check every week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't wanna hear any argument from</v>

2136
01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:40.350
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2137
01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that'd be cool for like a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think after that,</v>

2138
01:29:43.321 --> 01:29:44.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2139
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:44.620
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2140
01:29:44.621 --> 01:29:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I can see myself doing that if I had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of money.</v>

2141
01:29:46.831 --> 01:29:51.831
<v Speaker 1>But women would think that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>demoralizing and it would be the exact </v>

2142
01:29:51.831 --> 01:29:52.740
<v Speaker 1>opposite of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2143
01:29:52.741 --> 01:29:53.430
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2144
01:29:53.431 --> 01:29:56.100
<v Speaker 1>why pay for the cow when the milk is </v>
<v Speaker 1>free?</v>

2145
01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Right will be the exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be like,</v>

2146
01:29:58.351 --> 01:29:59.640
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm getting free melt,</v>

2147
01:29:59.641 --> 01:30:01.620
<v Speaker 1>but I would rather pay for the cow and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that fucking cow.</v>

2148
01:30:01.621 --> 01:30:06.621
<v Speaker 1>Give me anytime I want with no argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get up at four in the </v>

2149
01:30:06.621 --> 01:30:09.951
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to milk you when you start </v>

2150
01:30:09.951 --> 01:30:09.951
<v Speaker 1>complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2151
01:30:09.951 --> 01:30:12.141
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pay you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what happens with our </v>

2152
01:30:12.141 --> 01:30:12.900
<v Speaker 1>relationship now is we're still friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still love you were boyfriend,</v>

2153

2154
01:30:15.751 --> 01:30:16.440
<v Speaker 1>dick whenever asked.</v>

2155
01:30:16.970 --> 01:30:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Now you got the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that process but yeah.</v>

2156
01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:20.490

2157
01:30:20.670 --> 01:30:22.030
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that illegal?</v>

2158
01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:25.140
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would say that's not illegal.</v>

2159
01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:28.470
<v Speaker 1>If you say it is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it on your tax forms?</v>

2160
01:30:28.471 --> 01:30:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

01:30:52.181 --> 01:30:55.101
<v Speaker 1>started dating her and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do a little carpentry here and </v>

2172
01:30:55.101 --> 01:30:55.101
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did it for free because you loved</v>

2173
01:30:55.101 --> 01:30:55.950
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden she said,</v>

2174
01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:57.990
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like your job.</v>

2175
01:30:58.020 --> 01:30:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just come from me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work for me.</v>

2176
01:30:59.911 --> 01:31:02.670
<v Speaker 1>You'll be my carpenter and you just do </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever I want to do whenever you want.</v>

2177
01:31:02.671 --> 01:31:04.350
<v Speaker 1>But the only difference is now a pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2178
01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.890
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference between that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking your dick is very,</v>

2179
01:31:07.891 --> 01:31:09.240
<v Speaker 1>very little difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2180
01:31:09.450 --> 01:31:14.450
<v Speaker 1>If you have a chance and she's working </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you and she just gets paid to blow </v>

2181
01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:15.330
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she used to blow you for free.</v>

2182
01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:18.000
<v Speaker 1>But now she blows you because it's her </v>
<v Speaker 1>job because you pair,</v>

2183
01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:19.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that bad?</v>

2184
01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:20.910
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you make it.</v>

2185
01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:24.360
<v Speaker 3>Let her just let her make her dress up </v>
<v Speaker 3>an outfit.</v>

2186
01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.810
<v Speaker 1>The old girl only giving my only whore.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2192
01:31:38.491 --> 01:31:43.491
<v Speaker 1>because I think the purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my purpose was always finding somebody </v>

2193
01:31:43.491 --> 01:31:47.241
<v Speaker 1>that would want to fuck me that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>without any questions asked in that I </v>

2194
01:31:47.241 --> 01:31:47.550
<v Speaker 1>would want to fuck that first that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't give you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sexuality has been immoral.</v>

2321
01:37:07.431 --> 01:37:09.561
<v Speaker 1>the bathroom together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll get each other's cocks to get </v>

<v Speaker 5>I wanted to mention something you talked</v>

2324
01:37:10.741 --> 01:37:14.940
<v Speaker 5>about last week in your secret podcast </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I wanted to tell you that no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2327

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2328
01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:21.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

01:37:21.161 --> 01:37:22.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean moneywise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2330
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:23.130
<v Speaker 1>but as a comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of people.</v>

2333
01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:29.230
<v Speaker 1>It was sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honest.</v>

2334
01:37:29.290 --> 01:37:31.690
<v Speaker 1>At the end of brokeback mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the guy found out the other guy was</v>

2335
01:37:31.691 --> 01:37:32.980
<v Speaker 1>beaten to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was sad.</v>

2336
01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:34.990
<v Speaker 1>I never saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will never watch that.</v>

2337
01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:40.020
<v Speaker 1>You want them while it's just watch it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and video put like little kittens over </v>

<v Speaker 5>just like you always do.</v>

2340
01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:48.070
<v Speaker 5>There's some shit that I won't watch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I won't watch anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 5>started cutting the dude's head off.</v>

2343
01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:55.740
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2346
01:37:58.770 --> 01:38:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2348
01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:02.770
<v Speaker 1>there's no need to be watching that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2349
01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.320
<v Speaker 1>I never even watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2350
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Iraq shooting thing either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2351
01:38:06.631 --> 01:38:11.631
<v Speaker 1>that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to talk about this fake kung </v>

2352
01:38:11.631 --> 01:38:11.631
<v Speaker 1>fu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2353
01:38:11.631 --> 01:38:12.870
<v Speaker 1>You need a rack shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you need to bring that back.</v>

2354
01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Then I need to write it out with what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to do.</v>

2355
01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember how I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just redo it.</v>

2356
01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:19.400
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

2357
01:38:19.730 --> 01:38:20.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Iraq shooting thing,</v>

2358
01:38:20.821 --> 01:38:21.620
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2359
01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:26.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just talking about collateral </v>

2360
01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:26.720
<v Speaker 1>murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is.</v>

2361
01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.780
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a date mistakenly thought that </v>

2362
01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:32.130
<v Speaker 1>these reporters and civilians in Iraq </v>
<v Speaker 1>were insurgents and they killed them and</v>

2363
01:38:32.131 --> 01:38:35.010
<v Speaker 1>saw gun camera footage and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing.</v>

2364
01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:37.470
<v Speaker 1>It's disturbing how much they were into </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2365
01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:42.680
<v Speaker 1>It's disturbing how easy it is to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that anybody is your enemy when </v>

2366
01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:44.250
<v Speaker 1>you're over there and the fucking war </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the chaos,</v>

2367
01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:44.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2368
01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.140
<v Speaker 1>it's scary shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2369
01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.180
<v Speaker 1>It's scary shit that were there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first place,</v>

2370
01:38:48.181 --> 01:38:53.181
<v Speaker 1>but it's really scary shit to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people could just be walking with </v>

2371
01:38:53.181 --> 01:38:55.971
<v Speaker 1>cameras and they mistake those cameras </v>
<v Speaker 1>for guns just from the sky with apache </v>

2372
01:38:55.971 --> 01:39:00.441
<v Speaker 1>helicopters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking light them up with 50 </v>

2373
01:39:00.441 --> 01:39:00.441
<v Speaker 1>cannon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

2374
01:39:00.441 --> 01:39:00.441
<v Speaker 1>The caliber gun.</v>

2375
01:39:00.441 --> 01:39:02.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm done with that shit and anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's based off three men and a baby,</v>

2376
01:39:02.961 --> 01:39:07.961
<v Speaker 3>like three guys in a hammer in India.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was based on the baby.</v>

2377
01:39:09.111 --> 01:39:11.190
<v Speaker 3>Two girls and a cup cup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2378
01:39:12.130 --> 01:39:13.160
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right man.</v>

2379
01:39:13.161 --> 01:39:13.430
<v Speaker 3>You know</v>

2380
01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:17.120
<v Speaker 1>the problem is the internet really can </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only desensitize you,</v>

2381
01:39:17.121 --> 01:39:22.121
<v Speaker 1>but really change your world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 300 million fucking people in </v>

2382
01:39:22.121 --> 01:39:25.310
<v Speaker 1>this country that is an insane amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and if you think about like every</v>

2383
01:39:25.311 --> 01:39:30.311
<v Speaker 1>story that you hear about some priest </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's fucking kids or some serial killer</v>

2384
01:39:30.891 --> 01:39:34.760
<v Speaker 1>who's killing women or they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible and terrible,</v>

2385
01:39:34.761 --> 01:39:38.240
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is most people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty cool.</v>

2386
01:39:38.690 --> 01:39:43.690
<v Speaker 1>There's $300 million of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much information that </v>

<v Speaker 1>literally you find out every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking story anytime that they think </v>

2388
01:39:47.261 --> 01:39:51.311
<v Speaker 1>goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's never been the case in the 19 </v>

2389
01:39:51.311 --> 01:39:51.311
<v Speaker 1>fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to be ed gain.</v>

2392
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:57.000
<v Speaker 1>in their skin on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a fight.</v>

2393
01:39:57.050 --> 01:40:00.200
<v Speaker 1>You have to make the front fucking page </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the New York times,</v>

2394
01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:03.500

<v Speaker 1>that's another example.</v>

2397
01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:08.690
<v Speaker 1>The night stalker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he couldn't catch this guy and they</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know that there's bad people </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

2514
01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:39.050
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy says,</v>

2515
01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:41.360
<v Speaker 1>I've got a bunch of monster books out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my car.</v>

2516
01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

2517
01:44:42.411 --> 01:44:42.860
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

2518
01:44:42.861 --> 01:44:43.250
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2519
01:44:43.251 --> 01:44:45.170
<v Speaker 1>come on with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you some monster books.</v>

2520
01:44:45.171 --> 01:44:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2521
01:44:45.951 --> 01:44:47.370
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why he had monsters.</v>

2522
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:50.120
<v Speaker 1>I started leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still love monster movies,</v>

2523
01:44:50.121 --> 01:44:55.121
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I start leaving and as I'm walking out </v>

2524
01:44:55.121 --> 01:44:56.540
<v Speaker 1>the door with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking librarians starts screaming.</v>

2525
01:44:56.810 --> 01:44:57.860
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joseph,</v>

2526
01:44:57.950 --> 01:45:02.950
<v Speaker 1>joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get older because she knew me </v>

2527
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.950
<v Speaker 1>because I'd go to the library all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2528
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.950
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joseph,</v>

2529
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.950
<v Speaker 1>get over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get over here.</v>

2530
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:07.930
<v Speaker 1>That man just got out of jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the guy who runs the guy who </v>

2531
01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:09.350
<v Speaker 1>wants to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

2532
01:45:09.351 --> 01:45:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I run over to the library and I'm</v>

2533
01:45:12.171 --> 01:45:17.171
<v Speaker 1>fucking crying and freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crazy thing is my mom doesn't even </v>

2534
01:45:17.391 --> 01:45:18.130
<v Speaker 1>remember this.</v>

2535
01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom is kind of a knucklehead and when</v>

2536
01:45:21.261 --> 01:45:22.730
<v Speaker 1>it comes to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my childhood,</v>

2537
01:45:22.731 --> 01:45:24.470
<v Speaker 1>like I can't believe she doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember this.</v>

2538
01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not remember the most horrific moment of</v>

2539
01:45:30.291 --> 01:45:31.240
<v Speaker 1>my childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2540
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:34.240
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if that light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian wasn't there at that moment,</v>

2541
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:39.370
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't have a relationship with her</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I talked to her every time I was </v>

2542
01:45:39.370 --> 01:45:39.590
<v Speaker 1>there and she looked after me because </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a nice lady.</v>

2543
01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.150
<v Speaker 1>If that didn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was,</v>

2544
01:45:41.410 --> 01:45:44.540
<v Speaker 1>she was some absent minded person or </v>
<v Speaker 1>just wasn't looking or didn't know,</v>

2545
01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:46.520
<v Speaker 1>didn't know who I was with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy was.</v>

2546
01:45:46.930 --> 01:45:50.420
<v Speaker 1>I woulda got fucked in the ass for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have got killed.</v>

2547
01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:53.030
<v Speaker 1>He got killed because if this guy just </v>
<v Speaker 1>got out of jail,</v>

2548
01:45:53.090 --> 01:45:56.150
<v Speaker 1>he's probably tired of tattle tale on </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids and their bullshit,</v>

2549
01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:57.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2550
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:58.380
<v Speaker 3>it probably would have fucked me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kill me.</v>

2551
01:45:58.430 --> 01:46:00.960
<v Speaker 3>You know that company that has that </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that you like.</v>

2552
01:46:00.990 --> 01:46:03.150
<v Speaker 3>Old people were like help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've fallen and I can't get up.</v>

2553
01:46:03.151 --> 01:46:04.320
<v Speaker 3>They should make that for kids like </v>
<v Speaker 3>help.</v>

2554
01:46:04.321 --> 01:46:06.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting fucked and I can't draw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should.</v>

2555
01:46:06.210 --> 01:46:07.940
<v Speaker 3>But kids are fucking liars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2556
01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:15.810
<v Speaker 3>Be attached like boy scouts or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2557
01:46:15.811 --> 01:46:17.520
<v Speaker 3>boy scouts will come rescue you instead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Police.</v>

2558
01:46:17.521 --> 01:46:19.460
<v Speaker 3>There's those council.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you quicker than anybody.</v>

2559
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Nobody was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking knew like this because you </v>

2560
01:46:26.941 --> 01:46:28.180
<v Speaker 3>lied about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2561
01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:30.660
<v Speaker 3>You let dictionary rant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

2562
01:46:30.661 --> 01:46:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe there will be like a little camera</v>

2563
01:46:32.281 --> 01:46:33.630
<v Speaker 3>and microphones so that be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2564
01:46:33.631 --> 01:46:35.700
<v Speaker 3>you aren't getting fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll send somebody right now.</v>

2565
01:46:35.701 --> 01:46:36.030
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

2566
01:46:36.030 --> 01:46:37.930
<v Speaker 1>gps tracking is a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2567
01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:40.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's like the slippery slope.</v>

2568
01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:45.740
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you put a chip in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids so you could find out where they </v>

2569
01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:48.081
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they already called them with </v>

2570
01:46:48.081 --> 01:46:48.081
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know those.</v>

2571
01:46:48.081 --> 01:46:48.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have those.</v>

2572
01:46:48.081 --> 01:46:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But phones is big.</v>

2573
01:46:48.481 --> 01:46:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a chip in your skin mean like a dog,</v>

2574
01:46:51.451 --> 01:46:53.440
<v Speaker 1>like a dog has a chip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2575
01:46:53.550 --> 01:46:55.350
<v Speaker 1>so I can if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he gets going,</v>

2576
01:46:55.470 --> 01:46:58.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's only if he goes to the vet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they pick them up at the pound,</v>

2577
01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:01.830
<v Speaker 1>the pound could scan them and the ship </v>
<v Speaker 1>has like a number to call.</v>

2578
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:04.530
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people that want to put like gps</v>

2579
01:47:04.531 --> 01:47:06.420
<v Speaker 1>chips in their kids so they could follow</v>
<v Speaker 1>their kids.</v>

2580
01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:11.700
<v Speaker 1>That's retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It don't matter if your kid's not </v>

2581
01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:16.280
<v Speaker 1>retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the slippery slope is who else has </v>

2582
01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:16.280
<v Speaker 1>fallen you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the executive government.</v>

2583
01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Anybody else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black helicopters you always hear about,</v>

2584
01:47:19.411 --> 01:47:24.411
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dudes who like attached gps to their </v>

2585
01:47:24.411 --> 01:47:26.340
<v Speaker 1>chicks car because they're stocking them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they follow them.</v>

2586
01:47:26.341 --> 01:47:27.600
<v Speaker 1>They follow them around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2587
01:47:27.601 --> 01:47:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2588
01:47:28.890 --> 01:47:33.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a slippery slope because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conductivity is unavoidable.</v>

2589
01:47:34.890 --> 01:47:37.320
<v Speaker 1>It's unavoidable that eventually there </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be no secrets.</v>

2590
01:47:37.321 --> 01:47:39.270
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that we've talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this before.</v>

2591
01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that eventually we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to read each other's minds.</v>

2592
01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:46.560
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be able to access all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>information in the whole world,</v>

2593
01:47:46.590 --> 01:47:48.930
<v Speaker 1>not just on your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just a computer interface,</v>

2594
01:47:49.110 --> 01:47:54.110
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to be able to normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>access all this shit and that includes </v>

2595
01:47:54.110 --> 01:47:57.041
<v Speaker 1>as other people's thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to share your </v>

2596
01:47:57.041 --> 01:47:57.580
<v Speaker 1>thoughts into the wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds completely ridiculous.</v>

2597
01:47:57.581 --> 01:48:02.581
<v Speaker 1>Just sounds like total stoner talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it sounds nearly as </v>

2598
01:48:02.581 --> 01:48:02.820
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous as the things we already </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

2599
01:48:02.821 --> 01:48:07.821
<v Speaker 1>like the large hadron collider or cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones or the ability to talk to </v>

2600
01:48:07.821 --> 01:48:08.190
<v Speaker 1>somebody on the other side of the world.</v>

2601
01:48:08.370 --> 01:48:11.160
<v Speaker 1>That's just as ridiculous to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's all ridiculous.</v>

2602
01:48:11.161 --> 01:48:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Sending pictures to the air high speed </v>
<v Speaker 1>video you can download.</v>

2603
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:16.260
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got wifi.</v>

2604
01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I sit on my laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can download like the ipad.</v>

2605
01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:22.470
<v Speaker 1>You download a movie and a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes you could stream it.</v>

2606
01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Stream a movie alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

2607
01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:30.920
<v Speaker 1>You can just go to netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick a movie and high definition loaded </v>

2608
01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:30.960
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It plays.</v>

2609
01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:32.550
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the movie.</v>

2610
01:48:32.551 --> 01:48:35.370
<v Speaker 1>You're getting it from the ether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting a fucking full movie.</v>

2611
01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:40.460
<v Speaker 1>You put your headphones on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in stereo and you're getting it </v>

2612
01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:43.521
<v Speaker 1>from the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insanity and that is just the </v>

2613
01:48:43.861 --> 01:48:44.910
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna happen.</v>

2614
01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:45.840
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only.</v>

2615
01:48:46.170 --> 01:48:50.490
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the trend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number one trend is conductivity and</v>

2616
01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:55.580
<v Speaker 1>the instant access to information or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>more quicker access to information or </v>

2617
01:48:55.580 --> 01:48:56.160
<v Speaker 1>more access to information.</v>

2618
01:48:56.190 --> 01:48:57.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the trend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2619
01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:00.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be libraries and then you know,</v>

2620
01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:04.170
<v Speaker 1>then then it was the internet and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the internet on your phone and then</v>

2621
01:49:04.171 --> 01:49:05.850
<v Speaker 1>what else is next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's gonna come next?</v>

2622
01:49:05.851 --> 01:49:07.500
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier,</v>

2623
01:49:07.501 --> 01:49:09.780
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more information like that,</v>

2624
01:49:09.781 --> 01:49:14.781
<v Speaker 1>that search engine where you can just </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask it questions and it comes up with </v>

2625
01:49:14.781 --> 01:49:17.481
<v Speaker 1>the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that search engine called </v>

2626
01:49:17.481 --> 01:49:17.481
<v Speaker 1>being?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2627
01:49:17.481 --> 01:49:18.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a new one that they're working </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

2628
01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:20.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll find it on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

2629
01:49:20.311 --> 01:49:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I saved it on evernote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they called it the google killer.</v>

2630
01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Now know what's going to be the best we </v>
<v Speaker 1>already talking about.</v>

2631
01:49:27.410 --> 01:49:32.410
<v Speaker 3>But the visual search.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This I think what's going to be big </v>

2632
01:49:32.410 --> 01:49:35.500
<v Speaker 3>visual search where you just take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture of something and it will google </v>

2633
01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:35.500
<v Speaker 3>search what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything about it,</v>

2634
01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:37.070
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if you see like a,</v>

2635
01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:40.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you see like a tennis </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoe on the ground,</v>

2636
01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:45.500
<v Speaker 3>you can take a picture of it and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you what model of tennis shoe that </v>

2637
01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:45.500
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2638
01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:45.500
<v Speaker 3>where it's sold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much it is,</v>

2639
01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:45.770
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2640
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

2641
01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2642
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.270
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

2643
01:49:49.271 --> 01:49:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

2644
01:49:50.110 --> 01:49:52.750
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wolfram alpha is the new thing.</v>

2645
01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:57.780
<v Speaker 2>W o l f r a m alpha and what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this thing that these guys have been </v>

2646
01:49:59.141 --> 01:50:01.720
<v Speaker 2>putting together for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not totally done yet,</v>

2647
01:50:01.930 --> 01:50:06.490
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is that this is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to answer any question you have and</v>

2648
01:50:06.491 --> 01:50:11.491
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that really is the future that </v>

2649
01:50:11.491 --> 01:50:12.850
<v Speaker 2>they'll take the data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire database of science,</v>

2650
01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:15.910
<v Speaker 2>the entire database of archeology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

2651
01:50:15.911 --> 01:50:20.911
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mathematics and literally put it into </v>

2652
01:50:20.911 --> 01:50:23.380
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a search engine where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be able to ask the question.</v>

2653
01:50:23.590 --> 01:50:26.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what year was the first car invented?</v>

2654
01:50:26.350 --> 01:50:28.780
<v Speaker 2>What year was the first combustion </v>
<v Speaker 2>engine created?</v>

2655
01:50:28.930 --> 01:50:33.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did they figure out that you could </v>

2656
01:50:33.930 --> 01:50:33.930
<v Speaker 2>turn the oil from the ground and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gasoline?</v>

2657
01:50:33.930 --> 01:50:36.730
<v Speaker 2>How did they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was the guy that shits gonna happen?</v>

2658
01:50:36.731 --> 01:50:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna.</v>

2659
01:50:37.841 --> 01:50:39.280
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be able to get any,</v>

2660
01:50:39.370 --> 01:50:43.450
<v Speaker 2>any answer to any question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You literally never have to go to school</v>

2661
01:50:43.451 --> 01:50:43.690
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2662
01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:48.800
<v Speaker 4>I can't wait to the part where I can go </v>
<v Speaker 4>through my old photos from when I was </v>

2663
01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:50.120
<v Speaker 4>like five years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold it up to my webcam.</v>

2664
01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:51.450
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's their facebook.</v>

2665
01:50:51.451 --> 01:50:56.451
<v Speaker 4>They now do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They look at this because there's so </v>

2666
01:50:56.451 --> 01:50:56.570
<v Speaker 4>many people that have lost touch with </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know their name.</v>

2667
01:50:56.610 --> 01:50:58.050
<v Speaker 4>Babies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if it's a baby?</v>

2668
01:50:58.110 --> 01:51:03.110
<v Speaker 4>You can totally do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to totally be able to do </v>

2669
01:51:03.110 --> 01:51:03.780
<v Speaker 4>that to the 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How the baby grows up hundred percent.</v>

2670
01:51:03.810 --> 01:51:06.060
<v Speaker 4>Ten years or less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>

2671
01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're probably right.</v>

2672
01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2673
01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:13.000
<v Speaker 2>What's your fucking question?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who this guy named carlos when see it as</v>

2674
01:51:13.001 --> 01:51:16.870
<v Speaker 2>a homo and needs to send his fans to </v>
<v Speaker 2>space with the other monkeys.</v>

2675
01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:19.600
<v Speaker 1>All right buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Settle the fuck down.</v>

2676
01:51:20.170 --> 01:51:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Settle down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You freak.</v>

2677
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:24.940
<v Speaker 2>What is this guy saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hate men.</v>

2678
01:51:24.941 --> 01:51:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Sia for stealing jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you still don't.</v>

2679
01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:28.150
<v Speaker 2>T rex joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hypocrite.</v>

2680
01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:31.090
<v Speaker 2>I didn't sell steel shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See rex job.</v>

2681
01:51:31.410 --> 01:51:36.410
<v Speaker 2>Someone said that there was another guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a joke about trx not being able </v>

2682
01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:36.410
<v Speaker 2>to jerk off this.</v>

2683
01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:41.030
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How obvious is this that he can check </v>

2684
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.030
<v Speaker 4>off?</v>

2685
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Not the greatest connection in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

2686
01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:44.840
<v Speaker 2>but when you have small arms and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't grab your own dick,</v>

2687
01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:48.020
<v Speaker 2>I know anybody can come up with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion,</v>

2688
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:53.330
<v Speaker 2>but what I had it in is a whole series </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things about masturbation.</v>

2689
01:51:53.331 --> 01:51:58.331
<v Speaker 2>Now masturbation is evolutionary and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>joke was that's why the t rex didn't </v>

2690
01:51:58.331 --> 01:51:59.840
<v Speaker 2>evolve because couldn't jerk off 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent my own.</v>

2691
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a thing called parallel </v>

2692
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:05.590
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference between me and a guy like</v>

2693
01:52:05.790 --> 01:52:10.790
<v Speaker 2>me or most comics I've got ligaments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ia is most comics like dave attell is </v>

2694
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:12.530
<v Speaker 2>famous for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes up with a joke,</v>

2695
01:52:12.531 --> 01:52:14.330
<v Speaker 2>he'll call like a bunch of people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2696
01:52:14.331 --> 01:52:15.590
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever heard this before,</v>

2697
01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:20.620
<v Speaker 2>you've heard this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because sometimes guys come up with </v>

2698
01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:20.620
<v Speaker 2>jokes and even though you came up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it on your own,</v>

2699
01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:22.850
<v Speaker 2>you don't know whether or not anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>else has come up with it before.</v>

2700
01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:25.190
<v Speaker 2>It's very possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called parallel thinking,</v>

2701
01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:30.700
<v Speaker 2>but the difference between that and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy like matt cea or robin williams or </v>

2702
01:52:30.741 --> 01:52:35.741
<v Speaker 2>any of these other guys that have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>accused of doing it over and over again </v>

2703
01:52:35.741 --> 01:52:35.741
<v Speaker 2>is there so many fucking pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>

2704
01:52:35.741 --> 01:52:40.540
<v Speaker 2>So many times people have said it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many people know bits that they've </v>

2705
01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:42.860
<v Speaker 2>ripped off and like with a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 2>robin williams,</v>

2706
01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:45.170
<v Speaker 2>they used to have it set up where there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was special.</v>

2707
01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:50.560
<v Speaker 2>When he would come to the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would flash lights to make sure </v>

2708
01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:50.560
<v Speaker 2>that the comics onstage knew that he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the room.</v>

2709
01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:53.870
<v Speaker 2>When I was in boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at catch a rising star and cambridge</v>

2710
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:57.350
<v Speaker 2>robin williams came and I remember this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was really raw.</v>

2711
01:52:57.351 --> 01:53:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I was like an open mic or I'd only been </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing comedy like not even a year.</v>

2712
01:53:01.230 --> 01:53:06.230
<v Speaker 2>You got to piss and robin williams came </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the club and there was all these </v>

2713
01:53:06.230 --> 01:53:07.400
<v Speaker 2>comics that were like a big name.</v>

2714
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Boston comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of them was,</v>

2715
01:53:09.801 --> 01:53:11.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2716
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:12.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say names because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2717
01:53:12.471 --> 01:53:17.471
<v Speaker 2>I'm just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was a bunch of a boston </v>

2718
01:53:17.471 --> 01:53:17.510
<v Speaker 2>headliners in the room and none of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>would go on stage.</v>

2719
01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:22.540
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't go on stage because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew that he was in there and that if </v>

2720
01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:24.110
<v Speaker 2>they did a good bit on that stage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were local guys,</v>

2721
01:53:24.170 --> 01:53:26.270
<v Speaker 2>there were local headliners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were just local guys.</v>

2722
01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:28.280
<v Speaker 2>And this was before the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is before anything.</v>

2723
01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:30.710
<v Speaker 2>He would just go on the tonight show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next night,</v>

2724
01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:32.600
<v Speaker 2>do their bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that bit was dead.</v>

2725
01:53:32.630 --> 01:53:37.630
<v Speaker 2>They could never do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a totally different era back </v>

2726
01:53:37.630 --> 01:53:37.630
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's parallel thinking.</v>

2727
01:53:37.630 --> 01:53:38.980
<v Speaker 2>There's things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2728
01:53:39.110 --> 01:53:44.110
<v Speaker 2>I've thought of before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's things that other people have </v>

2729
01:53:44.110 --> 01:53:44.110
<v Speaker 2>thought of before that I've already </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

2730
01:53:44.110 --> 01:53:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Like I've had friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2731
01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:46.820
<v Speaker 2>do a bit and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2732
01:53:46.850 --> 01:53:48.710
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they didn't steal it from me,</v>

2733
01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:50.000
<v Speaker 2>but I have to tell them like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2734
01:53:50.001 --> 01:53:52.070
<v Speaker 2>that's on my first album.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this.</v>

2735
01:53:52.071 --> 01:53:54.680
<v Speaker 2>The same exact sort of connection that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just made.</v>

2736
01:53:55.190 --> 01:53:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Bobby slayton and I who bobby's a buddy </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mine,</v>

2737
01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:59.810
<v Speaker 2>but we both had a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2738
01:53:59.811 --> 01:54:02.750
<v Speaker 2>it's the same connection about blow </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>

2739
01:54:02.751 --> 01:54:05.570
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mine was on my 1999 cd.</v>

2740
01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:08.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know when his was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2741
01:54:08.150 --> 01:54:09.950
<v Speaker 2>he said to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2742
01:54:09.951 --> 01:54:14.951
<v Speaker 2>we have like a similar joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the joke was about blowjobs that </v>

2743
01:54:14.951 --> 01:54:17.570
<v Speaker 2>blow jobs or a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why implies like jerking off.</v>

2744
01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:19.190
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my joke was a drifting off.</v>

2745
01:54:19.191 --> 01:54:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like it's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

2746
01:54:20.931 --> 01:54:22.000
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2747
01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:23.120
<v Speaker 2>was just quit at any minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2748
01:54:23.121 --> 01:54:28.121
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just dripping off like no big </v>

2749
01:54:28.121 --> 01:54:28.121
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>

2750
01:54:28.121 --> 01:54:28.121
<v Speaker 2>You want to eat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just stop.</v>

2751
01:54:28.121 --> 01:54:29.630
<v Speaker 2>But a blow job sounds like there's much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more commitment.</v>

2752
01:54:29.631 --> 01:54:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're implies a work ethic,</v>

2753
01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:36.390
<v Speaker 2>but that like jerking off is way more </v>
<v Speaker 2>commitment involved the jerking off then</v>

2754
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:39.710
<v Speaker 2>blowjobs because chicks will quit blow </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs all the time.</v>

2755
01:54:39.711 --> 01:54:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Girls will quit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their mouth gets tired.</v>

2756
01:54:41.451 --> 01:54:44.510
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to do it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no dude quits while jerking off.</v>

2757
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:46.010
<v Speaker 2>And there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2758
01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:48.050
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like just fucking finish that thing.</v>

2759
01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:52.370
<v Speaker 2>I have had like a half hard dick and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like holding my breath and squeezing.</v>

2760
01:54:52.371 --> 01:54:57.371
<v Speaker 2>My boss tried to do anything to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to just get it over </v>

2761
01:54:57.371 --> 01:54:59.030
<v Speaker 2>with and then once you calm you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel so god damn pathetic.</v>

2762
01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:03.170
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of commitment involved</v>
<v Speaker 2>in jerking off for whatever reason.</v>

2763
01:55:03.171 --> 01:55:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Like that's shit wants to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body,</v>

2764
01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:10.240
<v Speaker 2>but I never for a second thought that </v>
<v Speaker 2>bobby stole a bit and he didn't think </v>

2765
01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:11.300
<v Speaker 2>that I saw the bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's kind of obvious blow job,</v>

2766
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:16.330
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the most clever connection </v>

2767
01:55:16.330 --> 01:55:16.330
<v Speaker 2>between it being a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2768
01:55:16.330 --> 01:55:17.150
<v Speaker 2>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in the fucking name.</v>

2769
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:20.910
<v Speaker 5>The problem with [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when like that t rex thing,</v>

2770
01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:25.940
<v Speaker 5>that's just something that's a cartoon </v>
<v Speaker 5>online that I saw after the fact that </v>

2771
01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:30.110
<v Speaker 5>the story they haD jokes about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that I mean that's just the </v>

2772
01:55:30.110 --> 01:55:30.890
<v Speaker 5>dumbest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just obvious.</v>

2773
01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:33.250
<v Speaker 5>Troll and I think might know</v>

2774
01:55:34.090 --> 01:55:37.210
<v Speaker 2>probably just stupid or was just young </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he doesn't know.</v>

2775
01:55:37.211 --> 01:55:37.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2776
01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:38.620
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2777
01:55:38.621 --> 01:55:43.621
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have questions about the way </v>

2778
01:55:43.621 --> 01:55:44.910
<v Speaker 2>Comedy works and whenever someone is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>about plagiarism,</v>

2779
01:55:44.911 --> 01:55:49.911
<v Speaker 2>like I have been in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have been with that whole men see a </v>

2780
01:55:49.911 --> 01:55:49.911
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

2781
01:55:49.911 --> 01:55:50.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like we set out to do that.</v>

2782
01:55:50.431 --> 01:55:55.431
<v Speaker 2>Not like we set out to be the guys that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are speaking up against comedy </v>

2783
01:55:55.431 --> 01:55:58.461
<v Speaker 2>plagiarism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But let me tell you how many fucking </v>

2784
01:55:58.461 --> 01:55:58.461
<v Speaker 2>comedians were happy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened.</v>

2785
01:55:58.461 --> 01:55:58.461
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell.</v>

2786
01:55:58.461 --> 01:56:00.780
<v Speaker 2>I've just got a text message from </v>
<v Speaker 2>christopher titus today.</v>

2787
01:56:01.230 --> 01:56:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Christopher titus was a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sent me a text today and </v>

2788
01:56:06.230 --> 01:56:07.660

<v Speaker 2>They played the whole carlos thing and </v>

2792
01:56:18.981 --> 01:56:21.420
<v Speaker 2>had two lawyers on talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>convenience protect our material.</v>

2793
01:56:21.630 --> 01:56:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Great job changing the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep the flow.</v>

2794
01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:26.360
<v Speaker 2>And you get a copy of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2795
01:56:26.850 --> 01:56:28.030
<v Speaker 2>This is a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2796
01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:29.640
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean louis,</v>

2797
01:56:29.641 --> 01:56:30.050
<v Speaker 2>c,</v>
<v Speaker 2>k,</v>

2798
01:56:30.051 --> 01:56:31.680
<v Speaker 2>so the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2799
01:56:31.681 --> 01:56:36.681
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brian posehn came up and hugged me and </v>

2800
01:56:36.681 --> 01:56:36.681
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank god for you joe rogan.</v>

2801
01:56:36.681 --> 01:56:40.401
<v Speaker 2>I mean I came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>todd glass came out to me and said it </v>

2802
01:56:40.401 --> 01:56:40.401
<v Speaker 2>was the greatest thing you've ever seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>in his life.</v>

2803
01:56:40.401 --> 01:56:42.000
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't tell you how many comics </v>
<v Speaker 2>have said this,</v>

2804
01:56:42.001 --> 01:56:47.001
<v Speaker 2>like we had a real problem for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and the real problem is that these </v>

2805
01:56:47.001 --> 01:56:50.730
<v Speaker 2>networks can make money from god's </v>
<v Speaker 2>stealing if guys are good performers and</v>

2806
01:56:50.731 --> 01:56:53.010
<v Speaker 2>they wound up stealing people's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can make a lot of money.</v>

2807
01:56:53.011 --> 01:56:57.750
<v Speaker 2>And for comIcs literally it takes a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass time to create a bit like,</v>

2808
01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:02.780
<v Speaker 2>a bit like my bit about the tigers </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing the kid at the zoo in san </v>

2809
01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:02.780
<v Speaker 2>francisco.</v>

2810
01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:04.290
<v Speaker 2>The one that made it onto my last </v>
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>

2811
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:08.820
<v Speaker 2>THat bit took a long time to get right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of shit involved in like</v>

2812
01:57:08.910 --> 01:57:10.950
<v Speaker 2>it went back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It changed,</v>

2813
01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:12.210
<v Speaker 2>morphed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it got bigger,</v>

2814
01:57:12.211 --> 01:57:17.211
<v Speaker 2>it got smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took a long time before I came up </v>

2815
01:57:17.211 --> 01:57:17.250
<v Speaker 2>with the version that got onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>

2816
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:20.280
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody could have easily come in,</v>

2817
01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:21.780
<v Speaker 2>jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My idea,</v>

2818
01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:23.580
<v Speaker 2>jack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my premise jack,</v>

2819
01:57:23.581 --> 01:57:28.581
<v Speaker 2>the whole way I structured it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set it up and just taking it for their </v>

2820
01:57:28.581 --> 01:57:31.671
<v Speaker 2>own and literally it's stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put it on television and now I </v>

2821
01:57:31.671 --> 01:57:32.190
<v Speaker 2>can't do it anymore because now if I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2822
01:57:32.191 --> 01:57:34.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when a minute cstl stuff,</v>

2823
01:57:34.291 --> 01:57:36.960
<v Speaker 2>he steals it like word for word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2824
01:57:36.961 --> 01:57:39.150
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like these poor folks,</v>

2825
01:57:39.151 --> 01:57:43.260
<v Speaker 2>like there are bits gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's got stole,</v>

2826
01:57:43.290 --> 01:57:45.690
<v Speaker 2>they got stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody took their shit.</v>

2827
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:48.720
<v Speaker 2>That's been a gigantic problem for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2828
01:57:48.721 --> 01:57:53.721
<v Speaker 2>we didn't set out to be the ones to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to put a fork in that and stop it,</v>

2829
01:57:54.150 --> 01:57:59.150
<v Speaker 2>but something had to happen and it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just so happens that it was us </v>

2830
01:57:59.150 --> 01:58:00.960
<v Speaker 2>and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just synchronicity.</v>

2831
01:58:00.961 --> 01:58:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Just the way the world works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2832
01:58:03.150 --> 01:58:08.150
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can understand why someone would want </v>

2833
01:58:08.150 --> 01:58:08.430
<v Speaker 2>to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scrutinize me extra carefully because of</v>

2834
01:58:08.431 --> 01:58:08.710
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2835
01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:12.180
<v Speaker 2>that only makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put red bands balls to your mouth,</v>

2836
01:58:12.181 --> 01:58:13.290
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

2837
01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:16.440
<v Speaker 2>that is a fucking rude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rude request.</v>

2838
01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:22.200
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this kind of comic named Brian </v>

2839
01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:22.200
<v Speaker 4>Jarvis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you ever heard him.</v>

2840
01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:25.260
<v Speaker 4>He has the best joke ever for some </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>

2841
01:58:25.261 --> 01:58:27.240
<v Speaker 4>Comics all like to show their dicks to </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other,</v>

2842
01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:32.420
<v Speaker 4>but he has this thing where he'll put </v>
<v Speaker 4>his dick coming out of the top of his </v>

2843
01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:34.350
<v Speaker 4>pants like right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just its head sticking out.</v>

2844
01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:35.730
<v Speaker 4>And he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2845
01:58:35.731 --> 01:58:38.150
<v Speaker 4>I fucking slammed my belly button in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>door.</v>

2846

<v Speaker 4>look and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean I hate that shit,</v>

2850
01:58:48.641 --> 01:58:53.050

<v Speaker 5>so committed to showing their dicks.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think that thing that happened with </v>

2854
01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:03.330
<v Speaker 2>the George Lopez thing was that it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty obvious bit.</v>

2855
01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:05.880
<v Speaker 2>The thing with the rap thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>

2856
01:59:05.970 --> 01:59:08.250
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a Fucking obvious job man.</v>

2857
01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:11.910
<v Speaker 2>And these dudes who do like mexican </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's very funny,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And that's thE kind of thing,</v>

2861
01:59:20.051 --> 01:59:21.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got to think like that.</v>

2862
01:59:21.630 --> 01:59:24.060
<v Speaker 2>George has never been accused of being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep before that.</v>

2863
01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Not that I'm aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2864

<v Speaker 5>he's not an obvIous joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was like five comics that dead </v>

<v Speaker 5>not only did ari open for him and do </v>

2866
01:59:34.461 --> 01:59:37.950
<v Speaker 5>that bit and he saw it and commented on </v>
<v Speaker 5>how he thought it was funny.</v>

2867
01:59:38.190 --> 01:59:42.430
<v Speaker 5>But that dumb fuck did the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>mannerisms that are like windows.</v>

2868
01:59:43.410 --> 01:59:45.120
