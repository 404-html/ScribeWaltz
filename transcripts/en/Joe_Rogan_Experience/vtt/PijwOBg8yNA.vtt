<v Speaker 1>airplane seat and it actually can be </v>

<v Speaker 1>this is a nice way of having these </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitable meetings and not having to </v>

44
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.931
<v Speaker 1>actually physically go somewhere that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen some day where there's </v>

<v Speaker 1>We'll meet somewhere and uh,</v>

61
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.820

<v Speaker 1>someone will pull their dick out.</v>

62
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you plead out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you,</v>

63
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>what if a kid's porn girls will </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually start using this?</v>

64

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>you have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of way,</v>

66
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>those porn gals are very clever at </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out a way to,</v>

67
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get through the system to have their own</v>

68
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Webcam show.</v>

69
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>I would think it would benefit them </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatly.</v>

70
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know you.</v>

71
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.080
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are some things that you are going</v>

72
00:03:37.081 --> 00:03:38.880
<v Speaker 1>to have to find out for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

73
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is weird.</v>

74
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But unless he used Goto meeting with hd </v>

75
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

76
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

77
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.960
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is saying that the,</v>

78
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

79
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 1>the images are actually hd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

80
00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's an opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they're saying is as it's an </v>

81
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.970
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to look at each other on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Webcam,</v>

82
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.940
<v Speaker 1>like really high resolution imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like just,</v>

83
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

84
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.520
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shittiness of the past.</v>

85
00:04:07.521 --> 00:04:08.930
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I think about Webcam,</v>

86
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 1>like any kind of conference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a horror movie or </v>

87
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.500
<v Speaker 1>talking to some duties in Antarctica and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

88
00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:17.810
<v Speaker 1>we've found the samples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's an issue.</v>

89
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.300
<v Speaker 1>And those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

90
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.730
<v Speaker 1>this is hd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

91
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.800
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to figure out a way.</v>

92
00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:27.110
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get in touch with Goto </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting and figure out a way to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just have one freak party session a week</v>

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 1>n n I t a on it is a Human optimization </v>
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>

101
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.340

<v Speaker 1>work better,</v>

102
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.470
<v Speaker 1>whether it's vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients,</v>

103
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.610
<v Speaker 1>strength and conditioning equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all shit that we think is really </v>

104
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.571
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all shit that has been proven to </v>

105
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:09.941
<v Speaker 1>have some sort of effect either on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body's ability to produce testosterone </v>

106
00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:14.090
<v Speaker 1>or your body's ability to process oxygen</v>
<v Speaker 1>more efficiently.</v>

107
00:05:14.091 --> 00:05:17.810

<v Speaker 1>All of it is science backed.</v>

108
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 1>All of that is explained on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but always explained on the website and </v>

109
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.430
<v Speaker 1>we're running studies on every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that we have,</v>

110
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.280
<v Speaker 1>so it takes a long time to do these </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies.</v>

111
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.740
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time to get them </v>
<v Speaker 1>published,</v>

112
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 1>but we've been working on it for awhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're trying to have this as legit </v>

113
00:05:40.101 --> 00:05:42.260
<v Speaker 1>and above board as is humanly possible.</v>

114
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.050
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways we do that is there is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 pill,</v>

115
00:05:45.051 --> 00:05:50.051
<v Speaker 1>90 day money back guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to return the </v>

116
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:53.021
<v Speaker 1>product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you try out any of the nutrients </v>

117
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:53.280
<v Speaker 1>like alpha brain or shroom tack and </v>

124
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.771
<v Speaker 1>different nutrients that have beneficial</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects on your body and if you combine </v>

125
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:23.081
<v Speaker 1>them correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have a positive impact on your </v>

126
00:06:23.081 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 1>cognitive function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning the way your brain works,</v>

127
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>it allows your brain to fire better.</v>

128
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also been praised recently.</v>

129
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain has been for a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's eight and lucid dreaming.</v>

130
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Apparently these cats I've never </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced.</v>

131
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Justin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have lucid dreams.</v>

132
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Depends on what your definition of lucid</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreaming is.</v>

133
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Legit wet dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's probably lucid dreaming,</v>

134
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've had dreams.</v>

135
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:53.171
<v Speaker 1>Where.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had a dream when you wake </v>

136
00:06:53.171 --> 00:06:53.171
<v Speaker 1>up in the dream?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think you're awake?</v>

137
00:06:53.171 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then realize you're still.</v>

138
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a trip that's kind of lucid.</v>

139
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.950
<v Speaker 1>I think there's people though they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it down to the point where they can </v>

140
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.071
<v Speaker 1>travel like in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can actually like getting that </v>

141
00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:06.071
<v Speaker 1>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>northern that dream.</v>

142
00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:10.861
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There in the world of imagination and </v>

143
00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:12.581
<v Speaker 1>just travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can do things like some like they </v>

144
00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>get really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it sounds crazy.</v>

145
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:18.101
<v Speaker 1>I and I'm talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking completely from ignorance </v>

146
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:20.000
<v Speaker 1>because I've never experienced it.</v>

147
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I've experienced states have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never been able to like say I </v>

148
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>am going to go fight a dragon if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever have a recurring dream.</v>

149
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

150
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:31.190
<v Speaker 1>I've had a couple of recurrent james had</v>
<v Speaker 1>won this recurring dream.</v>

151
00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:33.520
<v Speaker 1>That's really strange because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

152
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.020
<v Speaker 1>it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

153
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

154
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.960
<v Speaker 1>I've wrote it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called it a thousand teslas and the </v>

155
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.311
<v Speaker 1>idea was that instead of one nikola </v>
<v Speaker 1>tesla at the beginning of the 20th </v>

156
00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:49.451
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a thousand of them and these </v>

157
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:51.551
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers are just cranking it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and there was these floating </v>

158
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 1>machines that were flying around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sky,</v>

159
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 1>but everybody was still in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties and 19 sixties fashion garb.</v>

160
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.520
<v Speaker 1>But the world was radically more </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced and it was this basically you </v>

161
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 1>dreamed about the jetsons was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of like the jetsons.</v>

162
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 1>It was more english for some reason.</v>

163
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Everybody had an english accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very,</v>

164
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

165
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:16.160
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of like proper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 19,</v>

166
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.390
<v Speaker 1>early 19 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Behavior and dress cm punk shit.</v>

167
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really weird.</v>

168
00:08:22.071 --> 00:08:27.071
<v Speaker 1>It's a really weird dream because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened more than once and it's almost </v>

169
00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:28.740
<v Speaker 1>like my brain is trying to process that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 1>me being a stupid dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:34.580
<v Speaker 1>and I see shit like I see people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

172
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.360
<v Speaker 1>figuring out the large hadron collider </v>
<v Speaker 1>and figuring out some new bacteria that </v>

173
00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:45.440
<v Speaker 1>they've developed that eats plastic and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just think if it was me,</v>

174
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.530
<v Speaker 1>if it was up to me to run this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy planet,</v>

175
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 1>much of this work would get done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how much of that absolutely none.</v>

176
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I would have never invented any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I realized</v>

177
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.070
<v Speaker 2>a guy like nikola tesla comes along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one super genius out of this world </v>

178
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:05.190
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker who creates 100 different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that change the world.</v>

179
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 2>If that guy had a thousand other ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>like him,</v>

180
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.780
<v Speaker 2>it would have been an amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation of humanity.</v>

181
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.120
<v Speaker 2>It's just that he was so incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>unique.</v>

182
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:20.300
<v Speaker 2>This one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course there was other inventors </v>

183
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.120
<v Speaker 2>and edison and hundreds of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>inventors,</v>

184
00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:26.121
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're responsible for a lot of the </v>

185
00:09:26.121 --> 00:09:26.190
<v Speaker 2>other things that he actually used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make his things.</v>

186
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a clear chain of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>

187
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:32.760
<v Speaker 2>but if there was a thousand of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>super genius motherfuckers that can just</v>

188
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:34.590
<v Speaker 2>pull these nutty ideas out of thin air,</v>

189
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.910
<v Speaker 3>I gotta tell you man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you look,</v>

190
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.380
<v Speaker 3>if I would have told you and on a.com,</v>
<v Speaker 3>codename,</v>

191
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.330
<v Speaker 3>rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

192
00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:45.810
<v Speaker 3>that's a car show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was having this conversation with </v>

193
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.511
<v Speaker 3>somebody the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I told you in 1987 that you would </v>

194
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:52.861
<v Speaker 3>have a little thing about the size of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>deck of cards that you carry around in </v>

195
00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:55.030
<v Speaker 3>your hand and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the touch of a button can talk to anyone</v>

196
00:09:55.031 --> 00:09:57.160
<v Speaker 3>on earth with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Video,</v>

197
00:09:57.161 --> 00:10:01.330
<v Speaker 3>chat with people and access all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>known information in the universe.</v>

198
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one would fucking believe you for 60 </v>

199
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.480
<v Speaker 3>bucks a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

200
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:12.510
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would also allow your government </v>

201
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:12.510
<v Speaker 3>to track every move you make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

202
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:12.650
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can track it.</v>

203
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 2>Remove your mic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will just see that there was a,</v>

204
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:17.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an app that was,</v>

205
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had this app and they took it down </v>

206
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:22.980
<v Speaker 2>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an android app that allows people</v>

207
00:10:22.981 --> 00:10:25.740
<v Speaker 2>to turn your phone on a listen</v>

208
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.540
<v Speaker 3>you and record you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It allows,</v>

209
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:34.100
<v Speaker 3>allows him to hear everything that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in the room and track you </v>

210
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 3>through gps that they were using that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's some of the shit that we're using</v>

211
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:40.440
<v Speaker 3>in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is some crazy shit.</v>

212
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:46.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean weird if you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the phone's got it all.</v>

213
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bluetooth do.</v>

214
00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:54.060
<v Speaker 3>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever followed any of the </v>

215
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.330
<v Speaker 3>stuxnet shit and the viruses that came </v>
<v Speaker 3>out around that time?</v>

216
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.640
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of the name of the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>virus,</v>

217
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.560
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

218
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.260
<v Speaker 3>had to be designed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were saying the cia or is real,</v>

219
00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:06.261
<v Speaker 3>one of the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things that the virus </v>

220
00:11:06.261 --> 00:11:06.720
<v Speaker 3>would do is on a computer that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>infected with it,</v>

221
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 3>it would search for any bluetooth </v>
<v Speaker 3>connections in the area.</v>

222
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.040
<v Speaker 3>So if your phone had the bluetooth on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't protected,</v>

223
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.040
<v Speaker 3>figure connected that bluetooth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will connect to that phone.</v>

224
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.220
<v Speaker 3>This is a computer with a virus on it </v>
<v Speaker 3>will connect to a phone,</v>

225
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.190
<v Speaker 3>download the address book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the contacts.</v>

226
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:28.250
<v Speaker 3>All that shit and then upload it to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cash site basically,</v>

227
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.880
<v Speaker 3>where then they could come and get it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it would also wait for </v>

228
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.160
<v Speaker 3>instructions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

229
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not science fiction,</v>

230
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:39.300
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this shit's incredible.</v>

231
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.430
<v Speaker 3>Shit happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

232
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.480
<v Speaker 3>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you saw that michael hastings </v>

233
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.251
<v Speaker 3>junior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reporter that drove 100 miles an </v>

234
00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:49.590
<v Speaker 3>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you,</v>

235
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.250
<v Speaker 3>did you freak out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

236
00:11:51.251 --> 00:11:52.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

237
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:53.830
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

238
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.400
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some people in this </v>

239
00:11:59.400 --> 00:11:59.400
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably better off.</v>

240
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 3>Not fucking with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

241
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.190
<v Speaker 3>even if it's an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

242
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:08.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have people that kill your </v>

243
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.390
<v Speaker 3>nation's enemy for a living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really want to cross that.</v>

244
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.480
<v Speaker 3>You really want to fuck with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

245
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.090
<v Speaker 3>who knows what kind of technology they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

246
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 3>If they can do that with a phone with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>virus that was engineered either by,</v>

247
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some superintelligent dudes from </v>

248
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.640
<v Speaker 3>whatever country and they can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else can they do that we can't do?</v>

249
00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:32.860
<v Speaker 3>But that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where this recurrent </v>

250
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:32.860
<v Speaker 3>dream just kept coming from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so fucking stupid.</v>

251
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.820
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so fucking stupid,</v>

252
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:39.330
<v Speaker 3>like in comparison to all these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can make these laptops and make </v>

253
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.300
<v Speaker 3>these phones and figured out these </v>
<v Speaker 3>viruses.</v>

254
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:44.590
<v Speaker 3>I am so removed from the ability to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

255
00:12:44.591 --> 00:12:46.420
<v Speaker 3>But you know what the to me the thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

256
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:47.870
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're okay,</v>

257
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.490
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of race car drivers don't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to build a car either.</v>

258
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.390
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

259
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.140
<v Speaker 3>And to me that's one of the things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biggest thing would like what I do.</v>

260
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I make my living now,</v>

261
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.480
<v Speaker 3>and I started with photography before </v>
<v Speaker 3>digital camera.</v>

262
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.520
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't for digital cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would've never picked up a camera if I</v>

263
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:11.521
<v Speaker 3>would've had to pick up a camera and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then go take some goddamn film and have </v>

264
00:13:11.521 --> 00:13:13.460
<v Speaker 3>it developed and do all this bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

265
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.090
<v Speaker 3>every time you made a bad shot it costs </v>
<v Speaker 3>you a quarter.</v>

266
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no fucking way I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have stuck with it,</v>

267
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.530
<v Speaker 3>but because of the tools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a perfect example of it.</v>

268
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.040
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at what you've created out of shit.</v>

269
00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:29.390
<v Speaker 3>You buy off the shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

270
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:34.570
<v Speaker 3>it's a toolkit that allows people out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there to create things and we've seen </v>

271
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 3>that now with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

272
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.600
<v Speaker 3>film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

273
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:40.000
<v Speaker 3>you name it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bar to entry is no longer technical.</v>

274
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 years ago if you wanted to make a </v>

275
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.821
<v Speaker 3>film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were fucked if you didn't have a </v>

276
00:13:47.821 --> 00:13:49.870
<v Speaker 3>bunch of money because it costs that </v>
<v Speaker 3>much money to do anything now,</v>

277
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.470
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

278
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.930
<v Speaker 3>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who makes it,</v>

279
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.910
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking genius,</v>

280
00:13:55.570 --> 00:14:00.570
<v Speaker 3>but the guy who takes that tool and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>expands on it and creates new things </v>

281
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:02.680
<v Speaker 3>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just a smart,</v>

282
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.930
<v Speaker 3>well it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just what they,</v>

283
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people do though.</v>

284
00:14:07.071 --> 00:14:10.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean they build off of each other and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where the,</v>

285
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:15.100
<v Speaker 3>the thousand tesla idea came from is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you had a thousand of those </v>

286
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:15.760
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers communicating with each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

287
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:22.380
<v Speaker 3>but if you had a thousand means nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to figure out with the rock,</v>

288
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:28.530
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'll figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eventually find a sharp rock and I'd be </v>

289
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:32.821
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to figure out how to make these </v>

290
00:14:32.821 --> 00:14:32.821
<v Speaker 3>on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

291
00:14:32.821 --> 00:14:33.640
<v Speaker 3>I was driving out here from vegas and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had never seen this.</v>

292
00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:38.641
<v Speaker 3>It's been a while since I made the drive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know if this fucking </v>

293
00:14:38.641 --> 00:14:41.401
<v Speaker 3>facilities new or what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but coming out on 15 on the right hand </v>

294
00:14:42.071 --> 00:14:44.200
<v Speaker 3>side of the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw this.</v>

295
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.520
<v Speaker 3>It looked like a giant fucking pond or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lake or something like that.</v>

296
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.950
<v Speaker 3>And then there was a big ass tower </v>
<v Speaker 3>sticking up in the middle of it.</v>

297
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 3>And this is in the middle of the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

298
00:14:55.071 --> 00:15:00.071
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finally I figured out it's one of those </v>

299
00:15:00.071 --> 00:15:01.550
<v Speaker 3>solar farms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen one of those?</v>

300
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:06.580
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to google this shit and find out </v>

301
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:06.850
<v Speaker 3>exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

302
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:12.310
<v Speaker 3>it looked to me like in the big ass </v>
<v Speaker 3>tower because I've seen some things </v>

303
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.910
<v Speaker 3>where these solar farms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have all these mirrors and they all</v>

304
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:18.760
<v Speaker 3>focus on this center tower and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn that energy into a,</v>

305
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.840
<v Speaker 3>I guess heat or however the fuck they do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

306
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at these images.</v>

307
00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Google images or solar farms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know this existed and uh,</v>

308
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.970
<v Speaker 3>for California it's a fucking crime.</v>

309
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.840
<v Speaker 3>They don't use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sitting here and I'm thinking,</v>

310
00:15:30.841 --> 00:15:33.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why isn't this fucking desert covered in</v>

311
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.600
<v Speaker 3>solar panels?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

312
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:36.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

313
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.180
<v Speaker 3>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess if you look at how much,</v>

314
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.000
<v Speaker 3>how much fossil fuels does it take to </v>
<v Speaker 3>create something like that and then,</v>

315
00:15:46.001 --> 00:15:51.001
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long is the break even point to </v>

316
00:15:51.001 --> 00:15:53.170
<v Speaker 3>where it actually is making sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point that people don't </v>

317
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:55.220
<v Speaker 3>recognize that it takes a lot of fossil </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuels to make things,</v>

318
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.960
<v Speaker 3>make plastics to make everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

319
00:15:57.961 --> 00:16:00.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean just drive the trucks to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit out there.</v>

320
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:01.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

321
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.140
<v Speaker 3>That's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

322
00:16:03.141 --> 00:16:07.280
<v Speaker 3>really important point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I guess even with,</v>

323
00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:08.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

324
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.200
<v Speaker 3>isn't it possible to make a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things without it though?</v>

325
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:16.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you used electricity only from</v>
<v Speaker 3>solar power to make machines that ran on</v>

326
00:16:17.181 --> 00:16:19.660
<v Speaker 3>solar power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

327
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:20.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

328
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.300
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I was thinking when I saw that </v>

329
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.971
<v Speaker 3>solar shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it got me thinking about oil and one </v>

330
00:16:27.971 --> 00:16:29.570
<v Speaker 3>thing I've always had a thought about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was after nine slash 11,</v>

331
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:34.571
<v Speaker 3>I think the one of the biggest fuck ups </v>
<v Speaker 3>bush had was he had the opportunity for </v>

332
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:40.630
<v Speaker 3>kind of a manhattan project moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if he would've came out and </v>

333
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.030
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

334
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.200
<v Speaker 3>we're getting off oil as much as </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible because it's not a green planet</v>

335
00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:49.940
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a tree hugger issue.</v>

336
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:55.420
<v Speaker 3>None of that to national security issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you look at most of the </v>

337
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.560
<v Speaker 3>bullshit our country's gotten involved </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the last 40 years,</v>

338
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.650
<v Speaker 3>it's for oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm not against.</v>

339
00:17:00.651 --> 00:17:04.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is a national security thing.</v>

340
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.840
<v Speaker 3>People who say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>

341
00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:06.980
<v Speaker 3>blood for oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

342
00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:10.700
<v Speaker 3>pay $10 a gallon for gas and watch your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking economy crash,</v>

343
00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

344
00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 3>But to me that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that could have been a manhattan project</v>

345
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:21.641
<v Speaker 3>moment or something similar to where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>make a giant breakthrough and because </v>

346
00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:23.780
<v Speaker 3>this country has always proven that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

347
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.840
<v Speaker 3>if you pointed in the right direction </v>
<v Speaker 3>and give it a mandate and then back it </v>

348
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.050
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect example,</v>

349
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.830
<v Speaker 3>moon landing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the apollo program,</v>

350
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:36.490
<v Speaker 3>they started with nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally nothing and 10 years,</v>

351
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.440
<v Speaker 3>not even 10 years later in that decade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

352
00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:40.880
<v Speaker 3>there was a man on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

353
00:17:40.881 --> 00:17:42.230
<v Speaker 3>depending if you believe on that or not.</v>

354
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.480
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

355
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.600
<v Speaker 3>my point is humans can get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can,</v>

356
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 3>if backed against the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can get some incredible</v>

357
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.050
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would have used that as a mandate to</v>

358
00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

359
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.770
<v Speaker 1>this is a national security issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

360
00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.800
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it would be your sounding like he's </v>

361
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:00.800
<v Speaker 1>like a real president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's true.</v>

362
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying the opportunity.</v>

363
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity was there,</v>

364
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.190
<v Speaker 1>so the opportunity was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But unfortunately that opportunity,</v>

365
00:18:05.191 --> 00:18:10.191
<v Speaker 1>it could have been capitalized on people</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than the people that were </v>

366
00:18:10.191 --> 00:18:11.340
<v Speaker 1>monopolizing the natural resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that wasn't going to happen.</v>

367
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.400
<v Speaker 1>The real issue is always money because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the money's being monopolized right now.</v>

368
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.680
<v Speaker 1>The money's being such a mass mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of wealth that's connected to oil</v>

369
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.470
<v Speaker 1>that it's almost if you let people </v>
<v Speaker 1>control that,</v>

370
00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:30.471
<v Speaker 1>the amount of money they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could have a giant crazy army and </v>

371
00:18:30.471 --> 00:18:32.720
<v Speaker 1>the year like you have to be really </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful of that and it's,</v>

372
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.560
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a shame that you know,</v>

373
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:40.640
<v Speaker 1>when you drive from vegas to California </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see those gigantic fucking open </v>

374
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.280
<v Speaker 1>desert fields where there's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

375
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Those could all be just filled up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>solar panels.</v>

376
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:53.210
<v Speaker 1>They could just be plugging cars in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cars they have now are getting </v>

377
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.560
<v Speaker 1>close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they have that tesla model s yeah.</v>

378
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.350
<v Speaker 1>That's getting really close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

379
00:18:58.351 --> 00:19:03.351
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What other technology do you use this </v>

380
00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:04.470
<v Speaker 1>100 years old?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

381
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.790
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

382
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Can you name one fucking thing you use </v>
<v Speaker 1>day to day?</v>

383
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.600
<v Speaker 1>That's 100 years old air conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not 100 fucking years old situations on </v>

384
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.531
<v Speaker 1>other users,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 years old and the internal </v>

385
00:19:18.531 --> 00:19:19.050
<v Speaker 1>combustion engine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you think that it's the most fun?</v>

386
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.520
<v Speaker 1>The problem with those electric engines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never driven an electric car.</v>

387
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.950
<v Speaker 1>They're missing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're golf carts,</v>

388
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.900
<v Speaker 1>they're missing soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did watch god.</v>

389
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.960
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was that car that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>made?</v>

390
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.600
<v Speaker 1>I forget where I saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a dude.</v>

391
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm high performance electric cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a hate.</v>

392
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Does a handle thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cars like a 100 grand or some bullshit </v>

393
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:43.950
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the numbers on it are sick.</v>

394
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Is that the tesla roadster?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

395
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.580
<v Speaker 1>this is a hand built thing this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes.</v>

396
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where the fuck did I see that?</v>

397
00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrible with that.</v>

398
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.060
<v Speaker 1>But anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

399
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.290
<v Speaker 1>the numbers on it are crazy and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the torque.</v>

400
00:19:58.291 --> 00:19:59.550
<v Speaker 1>There's no lag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no nothing.</v>

401
00:19:59.551 --> 00:20:00.690
<v Speaker 1>It's instant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

402
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.000
<v Speaker 1>everything's electric better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

403
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.940
<v Speaker 1>So it's just sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be better,</v>

404
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.300
<v Speaker 1>but he was actually running eighth mile </v>
<v Speaker 1>drags with it.</v>

405
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

406
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.290
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty slick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very fast.</v>

407
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

408
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wonder.</v>

409
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to go there.</v>

410
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

411
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.770
<v Speaker 1>What seems like it's going there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it tried to go there before.</v>

412
00:20:24.771 --> 00:20:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see that documentary who </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed the electric car?</v>

413
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's gotta be something </v>

414
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.790
<v Speaker 1>better than what we're doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning ship and you know,</v>

415
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:41.210
<v Speaker 1>that's how you get things done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like really stupid at this </v>

416
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.210
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

417
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.020
<v Speaker 1>So does this nuclear thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a really stupid idea to,</v>

418
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:48.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not educated enough on the nuclear </v>

419
00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:48.450
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear both,</v>

420
00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:53.190
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kinda like the old joke that you </v>

421
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:57.541
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can build a thousand bridges but </v>

422
00:20:57.541 --> 00:20:57.541
<v Speaker 1>suck one dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember he was a bridge builder.</v>

423
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.710
<v Speaker 1>You can build a thousand nuclear plants </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have one fukushima.</v>

424
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.360
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is this,</v>

425
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.310
<v Speaker 2>it's been a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's three mile island.</v>

426
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.490
<v Speaker 2>There's the fukushima and is it four </v>
<v Speaker 2>mile,</v>

427
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.760
<v Speaker 2>three mile island for 3:43</v>
<v Speaker 2>mile island?</v>

428
00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

429
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.480
<v Speaker 2>as I said before on the podcast for </v>
<v Speaker 2>apologies,</v>

430
00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:21.070
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fukushima and those are two a.</v>

431
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.710
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a turnover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's three.</v>

432
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:24.770
<v Speaker 2>So there's three spots.</v>

433
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Did you can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you russian nuclear plants are just bad </v>

434
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.210
<v Speaker 1>fucking ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's nuclear pants a bad idea.</v>

435
00:21:32.211 --> 00:21:36.080
<v Speaker 1>But my russians come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my point was that you,</v>

436
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.380
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with less than 100 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>of use.</v>

437
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You already have three spots that are </v>

438
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:44.560
<v Speaker 1>completely ruined forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forever.</v>

439
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Like longer than people have ever been </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

440
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

441
00:21:49.251 --> 00:21:50.720
<v Speaker 1>you go back 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

442
00:21:50.721 --> 00:21:52.910
<v Speaker 1>What did that dude look like 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago?</v>

443
00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Was that even a person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

444
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:59.610
<v Speaker 1>if you ran into that thing running </v>
<v Speaker 1>around naked eating fucking squirrels </v>

445
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.220
<v Speaker 1>with his face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's barely a person.</v>

446
00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's how long from there to now </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's like,</v>

447
00:22:04.931 --> 00:22:08.720
<v Speaker 1>that's like anybody can go back and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a picnic and you'll still get sick.</v>

448
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

449
00:22:09.681 --> 00:22:14.681
<v Speaker 1>it's still not healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like living near a fucking </v>

450
00:22:14.681 --> 00:22:14.681
<v Speaker 1>fresh spring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's creepy,</v>

451
00:22:14.681 --> 00:22:18.701
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't kept up with the fukushima </v>

452
00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:18.701
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard it's bad.</v>

453
00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:22.610
<v Speaker 1>There was now I don't know about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radiation and all that shit,</v>

454
00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:27.940
<v Speaker 1>but they were saying that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually debris now washing up </v>

455
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.300
<v Speaker 1>in Canada on the west coast and shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

456
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.510
<v Speaker 1>It's made its way all the way over here.</v>

457
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really weird.</v>

458
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.210
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that they,</v>

459
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:41.260
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an inevitable loss of this water</v>

460
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.770
<v Speaker 2>that they use in the cool down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactor,</v>

461
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.060
<v Speaker 2>keeps getting into the ocean that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting into the ocean,</v>

462
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 2>the tune of millions of gallons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they send the water in the cooler and</v>

463
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.880
<v Speaker 2>then pump it back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even that they pump it,</v>

464
00:22:51.881 --> 00:22:56.881
<v Speaker 2>it leaks out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of leakage to trying to </v>

465
00:22:56.881 --> 00:22:58.951
<v Speaker 2>develop a system of holding it in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now involves drilling these giant holes </v>

466
00:22:59.140 --> 00:22:59.590
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

467
00:22:59.591 --> 00:23:04.591
<v Speaker 2>deep into the ground and then inserting </v>
<v Speaker 2>this machine that essentially permafrost</v>

468
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:09.631
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's like tubes and you would </v>

469
00:23:09.631 --> 00:23:10.000
<v Speaker 2>freeze these tubes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a,</v>

470
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.900
<v Speaker 2>there's all these holes in the ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then around that you had placed this</v>

471
00:23:13.901 --> 00:23:17.230
<v Speaker 2>machine that freezes the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

472
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.440
<v Speaker 2>So it's a giant containment wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of gallons containment wall for</v>

473
00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:27.790
<v Speaker 2>keeping in this insane nuclear water </v>
<v Speaker 2>waste.</v>

474
00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:33.210
<v Speaker 2>But the issue is of course you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep the power on this machine on.</v>

475
00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:38.610
<v Speaker 2>And the whole point with you guys fucked</v>
<v Speaker 2>up was your power went off and then he </v>

476
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.541
<v Speaker 2>couldn't cool the reactor down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're doing another thing based on </v>

477
00:23:42.541 --> 00:23:46.140
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right when you've already been sort of </v>

478
00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.510
<v Speaker 2>been shown that we have these ideas of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what mother nature can or can't throw it</v>

479
00:23:47.511 --> 00:23:50.720
<v Speaker 2>us and it's only based on a limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>window of time that we've been measuring</v>

480
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:53.450
<v Speaker 2>it less than a few hundred years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>

481
00:23:53.451 --> 00:23:54.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 years ago,</v>

482
00:23:54.371 --> 00:23:59.371
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows what kind of shit bag</v>
<v Speaker 2>equipment they were figuring out what </v>

483
00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:00.500
<v Speaker 2>the wind speed the wind was when it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming and they didn't really know.</v>

484
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:04.960
<v Speaker 2>So that's a blink of a fucking eye in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of the world and how,</v>

485
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.220
<v Speaker 2>how the weather changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

486
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:12.230
<v Speaker 2>the weather can shift radically there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can do some really crazy shit.</v>

487
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:17.680
<v Speaker 2>So for you to count on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you being able to keep the power on is </v>

488
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.581
<v Speaker 2>just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You count on being able to turn it back </v>

489
00:24:21.581 --> 00:24:21.581
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

490
00:24:21.581 --> 00:24:23.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you'll probably be able to turn</v>
<v Speaker 2>it back on,</v>

491
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.780
<v Speaker 2>but count on keeping it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't keep it on what happens</v>

492
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:29.210
<v Speaker 2>that thaws out and all the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear water,</v>

493
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.020
<v Speaker 2>a trillion gallons goes flooding into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking ocean.</v>

494
00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a pretty big risk.</v>

495
00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.850
<v Speaker 3>That's a big bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

496
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.820
<v Speaker 3>It's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird that we're</v>

497
00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:40.990
<v Speaker 2>boiled down to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

498
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:46.020
<v Speaker 2>how did this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This seems like a chess game that </v>

499
00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:46.020
<v Speaker 2>someone treated like checkers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

500
00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:46.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like they figure you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we make it?</v>

501
00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Let's fucking do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we do a nuclear power plant?</v>

502
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just make it.</v>

503
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can do it.</v>

504
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.080
<v Speaker 2>What happens if power goes out?</v>

505
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.390
<v Speaker 3>That's human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

506
00:24:56.391 --> 00:24:58.310
<v Speaker 3>We've been doing that shit for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

507
00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.100
<v Speaker 3>since we came out of the cave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

508
00:25:00.101 --> 00:25:02.930
<v Speaker 3>but this is one of the most dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>examples of it.</v>

509
00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.560
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you could just completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>poisoned the environment to the point of</v>

510
00:25:06.561 --> 00:25:09.710
<v Speaker 3>like if you were an alien dvt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would look like venom.</v>

511
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.980
<v Speaker 3>Ddt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

512
00:25:10.981 --> 00:25:14.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean fucking cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tobacco.</v>

513
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:19.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean how many millions of people is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that killed over the years and it's just</v>

514
00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:26.170
<v Speaker 3>humans aren't the brightest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sharpest knife in the drawer when it </v>

515
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.531
<v Speaker 3>comes to shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much better are there certain </v>

516
00:25:29.531 --> 00:25:29.531
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much better those things?</v>

517
00:25:29.531 --> 00:25:30.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything about.</v>

518
00:25:30.491 --> 00:25:32.810
<v Speaker 3>I've never smoked and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

519
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:37.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything about that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the more dirty aspects of </v>

520
00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:41.090
<v Speaker 3>politics is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll never see a politician talk about</v>

521
00:25:41.091 --> 00:25:42.380
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too much money,</v>

522
00:25:42.381 --> 00:25:42.620
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

523
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.360
<v Speaker 3>Too much gas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as many taxes.</v>

524
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that amazing though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

525
00:25:46.521 --> 00:25:51.521
<v Speaker 3>what a weird commitment to something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that poisons people think about if </v>

526
00:25:51.521 --> 00:25:54.230
<v Speaker 3>you're a politician or if that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're in the business of government,</v>

527
00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:59.650
<v Speaker 3>here's an item that no matter whenever </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get into a tough spot,</v>

528
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:03.250
<v Speaker 3>you just fucking pass a sin tax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

529
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.930
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes and booze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People will bitch,</v>

530
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like,</v>

531
00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.960
<v Speaker 3>they won't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

532
00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.150
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

533
00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:14.160
<v Speaker 3>You tax it further,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to prevent this terrible plague </v>

534
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.250
<v Speaker 3>and that's how you spin it in a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to prevent this terrible </v>

535
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.041
<v Speaker 3>plague is by managing millions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars from it and then </v>

536
00:26:21.041 --> 00:26:21.660
<v Speaker 3>thus being connected to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An extra blade.</v>

537
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't ever let go of money.</v>

538
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.630
<v Speaker 3>Once they figured out a way to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>money from something,</v>

539
00:26:26.631 --> 00:26:31.631
<v Speaker 3>they just keep the law the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to create laws that </v>

540
00:26:31.631 --> 00:26:34.010
<v Speaker 3>stop politicians from making as much </v>
<v Speaker 3>money to cut their money back in certain</v>

541
00:26:34.011 --> 00:26:39.011
<v Speaker 3>situations like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This idea that that's the will of the </v>

542
00:26:39.021 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fucking stupid.</v>

543
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 3>It's creepy fucking organization we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

544
00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.890
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

545
00:26:46.891 --> 00:26:51.891
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the idea that our country </v>

546
00:26:51.891 --> 00:26:52.540
<v Speaker 3>started out with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

547
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.230
<v Speaker 3>when you went to government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was service.</v>

548
00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.860
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a full time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't meant to be a full time </v>

549
00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:03.291
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We weren't meant to have senators with </v>

550
00:27:03.291 --> 00:27:03.291
<v Speaker 3>40 fucking years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seniority in the senate.</v>

551
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.720
<v Speaker 3>It was meant that you went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did your service,</v>

552
00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:11.340
<v Speaker 3>you represented your district or your </v>
<v Speaker 3>local area and you know.</v>

553
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Then you went home</v>

554
00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:14.890
<v Speaker 3>and the next guy went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

555
00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Speaker 3>and we've turned into like basically any</v>
<v Speaker 3>other longstanding country with a ruling</v>

556
00:27:20.891 --> 00:27:25.891
<v Speaker 3>class and they put rs and ds in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their names to give somebody something </v>

557
00:27:26.021 --> 00:27:29.020
<v Speaker 3>to hang onto the vote for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all the same shit.</v>

558
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they absolutely provably force out the </v>

559
00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:38.561
<v Speaker 1>other parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely provably make it much more </v>

560
00:27:38.561 --> 00:27:39.680
<v Speaker 1>difficult for them to be involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>debates.</v>

561
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:44.600
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the coverage of anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's outside of the standard,</v>

562
00:27:44.601 --> 00:27:47.360
<v Speaker 1>two choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coverage from they learned from ross</v>

563
00:27:47.361 --> 00:27:52.361
<v Speaker 1>perot tell you what ross perot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion dollar monkey wrench in there </v>

564
00:27:52.361 --> 00:27:55.850
<v Speaker 1>fucking plans and folks who were young </v>
<v Speaker 1>and full of life.</v>

565
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.590
<v Speaker 1>He don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ross perot,</v>

566
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.720
<v Speaker 1>ross perot costumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush's second term.</v>

567
00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ross perot was a bad motherfucker.</v>

568
00:28:02.151 --> 00:28:04.340
<v Speaker 1>That's why clinton won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came around.</v>

569
00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Ross perot came around and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden there was this billionaire dude </v>

570
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.760
<v Speaker 1>explaining how the government works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining the federal debt,</v>

571
00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.180
<v Speaker 1>explaining the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

572
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.500
<v Speaker 1>the federal bank explaining taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

573
00:28:18.501 --> 00:28:20.210
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

574
00:28:20.211 --> 00:28:25.211
<v Speaker 1>He took out time on network television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what so gangster brought him </v>

575
00:28:25.211 --> 00:28:25.970
<v Speaker 1>because he was before the internet.</v>

576
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.370
<v Speaker 1>This was not going on when everybody was</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

580
00:28:33.911 --> 00:28:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Ninety two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

582
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:40.600

583
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:40.600
<v Speaker 1>with his campaign and it helps with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody's campaign.</v>

584
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:45.131
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker's going to get rid of </v>

585
00:28:45.131 --> 00:28:46.811
<v Speaker 1>all the crooks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so excited about them and people </v>

586
00:28:46.811 --> 00:28:46.940
<v Speaker 1>are excited about ross perot was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the original ron paul,</v>

587
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:52.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But ross perot was way more gangster </v>

588
00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.230
<v Speaker 1>because he had all that cash and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and how do I talk and saying,</v>

589
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:58.510
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crazy old fuck from down in Texas </v>

590
00:28:58.510 --> 00:28:58.510
<v Speaker 1>can tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>

591
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a real interesting thing.</v>

592
00:29:01.611 --> 00:29:06.611
<v Speaker 1>So from there they changed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>commission for presidential debates or </v>

593
00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:07.790
<v Speaker 1>whatever they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a privately funded institution,</v>

594
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations back it.</v>

595
00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:16.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's a government program </v>

596
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:16.140
<v Speaker 1>so they can decide who gets the debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't.</v>

597
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a ross.</v>

598
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:18.630
<v Speaker 3>What's crazy?</v>

599
00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.740
<v Speaker 4>I process in Washington where after have</v>
<v Speaker 4>started for a while,</v>

600
00:29:23.741 --> 00:29:25.570
<v Speaker 4>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She hadn't become a foreign lobbyist.</v>

601
00:29:25.571 --> 00:29:27.110
<v Speaker 4>Make $30,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>a month,</v>

602
00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:29.930
<v Speaker 4>then take leave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>work on presidential campaigns,</v>

603
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:34.070
<v Speaker 4>make sure you've got good contacts and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then go back out and if you just want to</v>

604
00:29:34.071 --> 00:29:36.860
<v Speaker 4>get down to brass tacks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first thing y'all to do is get all these</v>

605
00:29:36.861 --> 00:29:41.861
<v Speaker 4>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got these one way trade </v>

606
00:29:41.861 --> 00:29:41.861
<v Speaker 4>agreements that we've negotiated with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ehrs.</v>

607
00:29:41.861 --> 00:29:44.070
<v Speaker 4>Say us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll take the same deal we gave you and</v>

608
00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.260
<v Speaker 4>mail gridlocked right at that point </v>
<v Speaker 4>because for example,</v>

609
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:52.350
<v Speaker 4>we've got international competitors who </v>
<v Speaker 4>simply could not unload their cars off </v>

610
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:56.161
<v Speaker 4>the ships if they had to comply.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying if it was a two way </v>

611
00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:56.710
<v Speaker 4>street,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just couldn't do it.</v>

612
00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.370
<v Speaker 4>We have got to stop sending jobs </v>
<v Speaker 4>overseas.</v>

613
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Probably a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't win no business paper.</v>

614
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise we'd be occupying China right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

615
00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:11.150
<v Speaker 4>$14 an hour for a factory worker and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can move your factor south.</v>

616
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.260
<v Speaker 4>The border,</v>
<v Speaker 4>high dollar an hour for labor.</v>

617
00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:18.290
<v Speaker 4>Hire young 25.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's assuming you've been in business </v>

618
00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:18.290
<v Speaker 4>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got a mature work for you.</v>

619
00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:21.390
<v Speaker 4>Pay a dollar an hour for your labor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have no health care.</v>

620
00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.980
<v Speaker 4>That's the most expensive single </v>
<v Speaker 4>element.</v>

621
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.730
<v Speaker 4>Making a car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have no environmental controls,</v>

622
00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:30.740
<v Speaker 4>no pollution controls and no retirement </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you don't care about anything but </v>

623
00:30:31.591 --> 00:30:36.591
<v Speaker 4>making money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There will be a sucking sound going </v>

624
00:30:36.591 --> 00:30:39.150
<v Speaker 4>south so we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If if the people send me to Washington,</v>

625
00:30:39.151 --> 00:30:41.940
<v Speaker 4>the first thing I'll do is study that </v>
<v Speaker 4>2000 page agreement.</v>

626
00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Second row.</v>

627
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.250
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one last point here,</v>

628
00:30:46.251 --> 00:30:51.251
<v Speaker 4>I've called out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I decided I was dumb and didn't </v>

629
00:30:51.251 --> 00:30:53.171
<v Speaker 4>understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I called a who's who of the folks </v>

630
00:30:53.171 --> 00:30:53.171
<v Speaker 4>who've been around it and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why won't everybody goes south?</v>

631
00:30:53.171 --> 00:30:54.440
<v Speaker 4>They say will be disruptive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

632
00:30:54.441 --> 00:30:56.260
<v Speaker 4>for how long?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I finally got them up for 12,</v>

633
00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:57.570
<v Speaker 4>15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I said,</v>

634
00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.090
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does it stop being disrupted?</v>

635
00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.280
<v Speaker 4>And that is when their jobs come up from</v>
<v Speaker 4>a dollar,</v>

636
00:31:01.281 --> 00:31:04.250
<v Speaker 4>now they're $6 an hour and hours go down</v>
<v Speaker 4>to $6 an hour.</v>

637
00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:09.460
<v Speaker 4>Then it's leveled again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in the meantime you've wrecked the </v>

638
00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:09.460
<v Speaker 4>country where these kinds of deals.</v>

639
00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

640
00:31:10.411 --> 00:31:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Ms dot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dot,</v>

641
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:10.910
<v Speaker 1>dot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dot.</v>

642
00:31:10.911 --> 00:31:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ross perot was calling shit in 1992.</v>

643
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.680
<v Speaker 1>He was a gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he.</v>

644
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.300
<v Speaker 1>How correct was that though?</v>

645
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.800
<v Speaker 3>What's funny is he was just talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the auto industry.</v>

646
00:31:21.801 --> 00:31:26.801
<v Speaker 3>I spent 10 years in the auto industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked for ford motor company for </v>

647
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:27.070
<v Speaker 3>almost a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

648
00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:32.500
<v Speaker 3>I took a buyout and they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our plant actually closed a few years </v>

649
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:37.990
<v Speaker 3>ago that I worked at in indianapolis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that industry is not the same and </v>

650
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.140
<v Speaker 3>it's gone and people in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

651
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.510
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of shit with the union and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

652
00:31:44.511 --> 00:31:47.900
<v Speaker 3>you can argue both sides of that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like most things,</v>

653
00:31:47.901 --> 00:31:50.840
<v Speaker 3>there's no somewhere in the middle is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth.</v>

654
00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:56.000
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole way of life for a big part of</v>

655
00:31:56.001 --> 00:31:59.960
<v Speaker 3>this country that auto industry was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

656
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.570
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the middle class,</v>

657
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.520
<v Speaker 3>that was the middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

658
00:32:04.521 --> 00:32:09.521
<v Speaker 3>you could go to work for one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies or one of the companies that </v>

659
00:32:09.521 --> 00:32:13.061
<v Speaker 3>supplied that industry and work 30 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>and raise a family and your kids could </v>

660
00:32:13.671 --> 00:32:17.720
<v Speaker 3>have a better life than you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's all gone now.</v>

661
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a possibility for a guy to get</v>

662
00:32:20.901 --> 00:32:24.140
<v Speaker 1>a really good job without an education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

663
00:32:24.141 --> 00:32:29.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could get a really good job that </v>

664
00:32:29.141 --> 00:32:29.141
<v Speaker 1>paid really well and you could have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good living.</v>

665
00:32:29.141 --> 00:32:29.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have a boat,</v>

666
00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:30.810
<v Speaker 1>you could ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

667
00:32:30.811 --> 00:32:32.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have toys you could have,</v>

668
00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.640
<v Speaker 1>you could have a whole vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars</v>

669
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.450
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

670
00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:36.740
<v Speaker 3>and you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

671
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:41.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean like when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just worked a straight 40 hours,</v>

672
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.750
<v Speaker 3>you'd make about 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year.</v>

673
00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.090
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>60,000</v>

674
00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:49.940
<v Speaker 3>a year in Indiana or the midwest is </v>
<v Speaker 3>decent money.</v>

675
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.230
<v Speaker 3>If you worked overtime you could get up </v>
<v Speaker 3>80 to 100 grand,</v>

676
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:59.830
<v Speaker 3>but you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you worked your ass off seven </v>

677
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.830
<v Speaker 3>twelves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the overtime you could get,</v>

678
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:04.670
<v Speaker 3>you could top out at about 1:20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's literally living your life in</v>

679
00:33:04.671 --> 00:33:06.470
<v Speaker 3>the plant seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven days a week,</v>

680
00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:09.020
<v Speaker 3>12 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they do that.</v>

681
00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:09.890
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

682
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:15.670
<v Speaker 3>And I'll tell you what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad I did that because I was able </v>

683
00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:19.190
<v Speaker 3>to see that culture of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there was a long,</v>

684
00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:24.210
<v Speaker 3>there's a long history there of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because at least with ford motor </v>

685
00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 3>company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nepotism was a well established thing.</v>

686
00:33:26.961 --> 00:33:28.280
<v Speaker 3>That's how they did business.</v>

687
00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:31.340
<v Speaker 3>They hired sons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hired daughters,</v>

688
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:36.740
<v Speaker 3>you know that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was third generation for ford motor </v>

689
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:36.740
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked with guys.</v>

690
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.110
<v Speaker 3>I literally worked with three </v>
<v Speaker 3>generations of the same family,</v>

691
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:41.330
<v Speaker 3>grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>father and son.</v>

692
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

693
00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:50.260
<v Speaker 3>what years were this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was I hired on in 1997 to December,</v>

694
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.910
<v Speaker 3>2006 is when I left in December,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2000 dollars just from the mustang.</v>

695
00:33:55.911 --> 00:33:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Started getting good again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

696
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

697
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.660
<v Speaker 3>Figured it out after all those years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

698
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:07.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and there was a lot of institutional </v>

699
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.631
<v Speaker 3>memory and it was the only place I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever worked where people at a factory </v>

700
00:34:10.761 --> 00:34:14.000
<v Speaker 3>environment because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm from the midwest and I always worked</v>

701
00:34:14.001 --> 00:34:15.990
<v Speaker 3>in machine shops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tools,</v>

702
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.960
<v Speaker 3>tool and dye places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

703
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:23.860
<v Speaker 3>And that place you are proud to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

704
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:27.050
<v Speaker 3>You are happy to work there at least in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning.</v>

705
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.060
<v Speaker 3>But I mean a lot of people.</v>

706
00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:34.240
<v Speaker 3>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the ways they define </v>

707
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.671
<v Speaker 3>their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were a uaw ford motor employee and </v>

708
00:34:36.671 --> 00:34:40.241
<v Speaker 3>it sounds silly to people who have never</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't understand it or anything like </v>

709
00:34:41.451 --> 00:34:46.451
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to realize you're talking </v>

710
00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:48.671
<v Speaker 3>about people that they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have to wake up one day and </v>

711
00:34:48.671 --> 00:34:50.520
<v Speaker 3>make a choice between being a doctor and</v>
<v Speaker 3>being an auto worker,</v>

712
00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:53.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't their fucking options on the</v>

713
00:34:53.061 --> 00:34:58.061
<v Speaker 3>table there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Options on the table or be an auto </v>

714
00:34:58.061 --> 00:35:01.181
<v Speaker 3>worker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to send your kids to school and </v>

715
00:35:01.181 --> 00:35:03.281
<v Speaker 3>have a nice life or go out and scramble </v>
<v Speaker 3>for six and $7 an hour jobs for the rest</v>

716
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:04.420
<v Speaker 3>of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

717
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:09.640
<v Speaker 3>And that's so guys you bought into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They bought into that whole dream,</v>

718
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.010
<v Speaker 3>that thing of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

719
00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.600
<v Speaker 3>and the company pushed that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

720
00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.340
<v Speaker 3>we're in this together company and union</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

721
00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.930
<v Speaker 3>quality and all this other shit.</v>

722
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:26.380
<v Speaker 3>And people bought into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was why there was such a big </v>

723
00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.240
<v Speaker 3>backlash when people figured out that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

724
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.280
<v Speaker 3>no matter what the fuck you do on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>

725
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:37.210
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the asshole up in detroit decides to </v>

726
00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:41.231
<v Speaker 3>build a dog shit car or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or decides to like go buy fucking jaguar</v>

727
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.540
<v Speaker 3>and lose hundreds of millions of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 3>on shit like that.</v>

728
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:47.860
<v Speaker 3>And so that's how plants get clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

729
00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.580
<v Speaker 3>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a co,</v>

730
00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:51.990
<v Speaker 3>we lost our plant because all this shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>went to Mexico.</v>

731
00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:57.410
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it got to the point and the </v>

732
00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:00.231
<v Speaker 3>reason why our plant started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say in 1958 was when it </v>

733
00:36:00.231 --> 00:36:02.240
<v Speaker 3>opened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

734
00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.330
<v Speaker 3>when you have a plant that fucking old </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually,</v>

735
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just gets to the point where it costs</v>

736
00:36:09.511 --> 00:36:12.570
<v Speaker 3>more to fix shit than it does to move it</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere else.</v>

737
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:18.290
<v Speaker 3>So why would you spend $200,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehab in a plant that's 50 years old </v>

738
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.400
<v Speaker 3>when you could go down to Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get out from under all the fucking </v>

739
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:25.400
<v Speaker 3>retirement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>

740
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:30.111
<v Speaker 3>all the bullshit that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has accrued here for right or wrong.</v>

741
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:34.320
<v Speaker 3>And so they just finally were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>

742
00:36:34.321 --> 00:36:39.321
<v Speaker 3>we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what four did was they actually </v>

743
00:36:39.321 --> 00:36:41.511
<v Speaker 3>formed a company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kept all their plants that </v>

744
00:36:41.511 --> 00:36:42.510
<v Speaker 3>assembled cars under and they called </v>
<v Speaker 3>them ford plants,</v>

745
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:47.280
<v Speaker 3>all their plants that built parts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you didn't put a car together,</v>

746
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.620
<v Speaker 3>if you put a car together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were afforded employee.</v>

747
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.250
<v Speaker 3>If you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they spawn all their parts plants off,</v>

748
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:56.190
<v Speaker 3>which didn't generate money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were actually.</v>

749
00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.180
<v Speaker 3>So they spend all their parts plants off</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a company called visteon.</v>

750
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.480
<v Speaker 3>Gm did the same thing with delphi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they spend all these plants off and </v>

751
00:37:05.581 --> 00:37:06.180
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

752
00:37:06.181 --> 00:37:06.870
<v Speaker 3>you're on your own.</v>

753
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:11.870
<v Speaker 3>Now we're going to give you your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>company and you're going to have to go </v>

754
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:13.140
<v Speaker 3>out and you have to make your own money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pay your own bills,</v>

755
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:18.420
<v Speaker 3>but here's the fucking trick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These were four plants on monday.</v>

756
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.640
<v Speaker 3>On tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're visteon plants,</v>

757
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.060
<v Speaker 3>so now they're on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're on the open market.</v>

758
00:37:24.061 --> 00:37:26.100
<v Speaker 3>They have to make their own money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But guess what?</v>

759
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:31.190
<v Speaker 3>They've only got one customer ford motor</v>
<v Speaker 3>company because that's who they made </v>

760
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:32.990
<v Speaker 3>plants that they were for it on monday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

761
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:36.450
<v Speaker 3>So they were always made parts for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now what happens?</v>

762
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:41.750
<v Speaker 3>Ford comes to these companies before </v>
<v Speaker 3>they knew they were losing money when </v>

763
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:43.050
<v Speaker 3>they spun them off to make parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cost that ford was paying,</v>

764
00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:48.640
<v Speaker 3>and four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says you're going to have to do </v>

765
00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:48.640
<v Speaker 3>better on the price.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have to cut you off.</v>

766
00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:53.280
<v Speaker 3>And these were all ford people and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens is now they start cutting </v>

767
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.790
<v Speaker 3>and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

768
00:37:55.220 --> 00:38:00.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a long way for them to close a </v>

769
00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:00.220
<v Speaker 3>bunch of plants.</v>

770
00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:04.040
<v Speaker 3>Gm went through the same thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how they justify the moves to </v>

771
00:38:04.201 --> 00:38:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

772
00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:06.180
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

773
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.150
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

774
00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.650
<v Speaker 3>it was why did the car suck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

775
00:38:10.651 --> 00:38:14.760
<v Speaker 3>the cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of it had to do when I was</v>

776
00:38:14.761 --> 00:38:17.550
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cars were dog shit in the eighties,</v>

777
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cool quality.</v>

778
00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:25.131
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was Japan brought in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>quality aspect of it and you know,</v>

779
00:38:26.311 --> 00:38:31.311
<v Speaker 3>the old saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't ever buy a car assembled on a </v>

780
00:38:31.311 --> 00:38:31.311
<v Speaker 3>friday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

781
00:38:31.311 --> 00:38:32.040
<v Speaker 3>you ever hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

782
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.290
<v Speaker 3>that was detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was America,</v>

783
00:38:34.291 --> 00:38:36.940
<v Speaker 3>that was the american auto industry in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the seventies and eighties.</v>

784
00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:39.610
<v Speaker 3>And then they would just fat living high</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the hog.</v>

785
00:38:39.611 --> 00:38:40.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean they were just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

786
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 3>you'd hear stories about these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to have show up,</v>

787
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:49.651
<v Speaker 3>no show jobs to where at one time our </v>
<v Speaker 3>plant and had like 5,000</v>

788
00:38:49.931 --> 00:38:54.931
<v Speaker 3>employees there when I worked there we </v>
<v Speaker 3>had like 2100 and we were doing more </v>

789
00:38:54.931 --> 00:38:56.770
<v Speaker 3>work than the guys did in the eighties </v>
<v Speaker 3>with 5,000.</v>

790
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.590
<v Speaker 3>But they would have guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have,</v>

791
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.150
<v Speaker 3>they call them break off jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So say you're working a 10 hour shift,</v>

792
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:09.870
<v Speaker 3>you would go in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would go in and work two hours and </v>

793
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.781
<v Speaker 3>then you break off and the other guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>would come in and he worked two hours </v>

794
00:39:12.781 --> 00:39:16.100
<v Speaker 3>and he'd break off and you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because of what it was,</v>

795
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.060
<v Speaker 3>each job at a set rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

796
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.150
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is they send on </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding you.</v>

797
00:39:21.151 --> 00:39:24.610
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by break off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you say you're line,</v>

798
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:29.630
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've got to take this fucking cup </v>

799
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:32.400
<v Speaker 3>and put it here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pour some shit in it and then put it </v>

800
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.281
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they would do is they would say </v>

801
00:39:35.281 --> 00:39:37.591
<v Speaker 3>that's a two man job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so one guy would take this cup and he </v>

802
00:39:37.591 --> 00:39:41.191
<v Speaker 3>would set it here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other guy would pour some shit and </v>

803
00:39:41.191 --> 00:39:41.191
<v Speaker 3>then move it here.</v>

804
00:39:41.191 --> 00:39:42.550
<v Speaker 3>Now eight hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well one guy can do that.</v>

805
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:46.030
<v Speaker 3>So for eight hours you got two men on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this job.</v>

806
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:51.630
<v Speaker 3>I would tell this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go get lost for two hours and then I </v>

807
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.690
<v Speaker 3>will do both jobs and then he comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

808
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.850
<v Speaker 3>come back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he would do both.</v>

809
00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.390
<v Speaker 3>And so that's how you do the eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>

810
00:39:55.391 --> 00:39:57.580
<v Speaker 3>You actually only work for exactly two </v>
<v Speaker 3>shifts.</v>

811
00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those were called break off jobs and</v>

812
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:03.370
<v Speaker 3>the plant was rife with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

813
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.680
<v Speaker 3>And then they went through and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed all that shit,</v>

814
00:40:05.681 --> 00:40:08.470
<v Speaker 3>which they're supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I can go to the gym,</v>

815
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 3>got so fucking bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're only doing a day on a day off.</v>

816
00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:19.410
<v Speaker 3>They would come in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>run their car to show they were there </v>

817
00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:19.410
<v Speaker 3>and then jet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

818
00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:22.870
<v Speaker 3>one guy worked monday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tuesday work wednesday.</v>

819
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.280
<v Speaker 3>So you can understand in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

820
00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:25.930
<v Speaker 3>it's brutal.</v>

821
00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:28.690
<v Speaker 3>Need to get rid of american labor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

822
00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:32.650
<v Speaker 3>So at that point when it gets that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

823
00:40:32.651 --> 00:40:37.651
<v Speaker 3>there has to be a correction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I also lived in Kentucky and I saw </v>

824
00:40:37.651 --> 00:40:41.770
<v Speaker 3>when toyota came in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no before I worked before when</v>

825
00:40:41.771 --> 00:40:46.771
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid I went to college in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kentucky and then the summers I worked </v>

826
00:40:46.771 --> 00:40:50.431
<v Speaker 3>for a toyota parts plant down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I saw that side of the auto industry </v>

827
00:40:50.431 --> 00:40:54.901
<v Speaker 3>before I ever saw the big money union </v>
<v Speaker 3>side and the way that worked was equally</v>

828
00:40:56.801 --> 00:40:59.050
<v Speaker 3>as fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on the other end of the scale,</v>

829
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.660
<v Speaker 3>what they would do is they would hire </v>
<v Speaker 3>temp workers.</v>

830
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they would go in and you would do,</v>

831
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:09.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assembly work or wherever the fuck it </v>

832
00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.011
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they would dangle this idea of a </v>

833
00:41:11.011 --> 00:41:13.861
<v Speaker 3>full time job in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this is in southeastern Kentucky </v>

834
00:41:13.861 --> 00:41:15.550
<v Speaker 3>where if you could make $15 an hour in </v>
<v Speaker 3>1993,</v>

835
00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:20.290
<v Speaker 3>you could live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can own a house because the shit,</v>

836
00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:22.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$40,000</v>

837
00:41:22.031 --> 00:41:27.031
<v Speaker 3>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a great wage because there's </v>

838
00:41:27.031 --> 00:41:29.100
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's walmart or nothing or you know,</v>

839
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:30.820
<v Speaker 3>you sell weed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

840
00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 3>And but what they would do</v>

841
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.440
<v Speaker 1>is it would hire these temps in say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

842
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:40.610
<v Speaker 1>you got a 90 day probation period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can work if we like you,</v>

843
00:41:40.611 --> 00:41:41.930
<v Speaker 1>we'll hire you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get benefits,</v>

844
00:41:41.931 --> 00:41:46.931
<v Speaker 1>you get all this bullshit problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they hired you through a temp </v>

845
00:41:46.931 --> 00:41:50.111
<v Speaker 1>agency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem is they never fucking hired </v>

846
00:41:50.111 --> 00:41:52.751
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've worked for 89 days and then say </v>

847
00:41:52.751 --> 00:41:55.730
<v Speaker 1>we don't need you tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send you home and bring another guy in.</v>

848
00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.760
<v Speaker 1>So they never hired anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>

849
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:02.590
<v Speaker 1>They just kept their employee filled </v>
<v Speaker 1>with temps and then you know,</v>

850
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:05.410
<v Speaker 1>they would find there are certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions where they needed,</v>

851
00:42:05.411 --> 00:42:06.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supervisors,</v>

852
00:42:06.411 --> 00:42:07.850
<v Speaker 1>quality guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit like that.</v>

853
00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Skilled positions and they would hire </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people full time but grounds on </v>

854
00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.970
<v Speaker 1>the line and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you were cannon fodder.</v>

855
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.390
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cause and effect.</v>

856
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.490
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

857
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.280
<v Speaker 1>there's things were out of control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

858
00:42:21.281 --> 00:42:25.220
<v Speaker 1>the counter effect of that is to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>not have it up here at all.</v>

859
00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is really interesting.</v>

860
00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.930
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where,</v>

861
00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.540
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is is it's,</v>

862
00:42:29.541 --> 00:42:34.541
<v Speaker 1>it's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just we were losing the middle </v>

863
00:42:34.541 --> 00:42:37.121
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've lost it and I can see both </v>

864
00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:37.121
<v Speaker 1>arguments for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

865
00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:38.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of a guy.</v>

866
00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Like now what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go work in casinos and I have to work </v>

867
00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.440
<v Speaker 1>with unions and it makes me want to pull</v>
<v Speaker 1>my fucking hair out.</v>

868
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:50.030
<v Speaker 1>It's the most brutal shit in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the culinary unions in front</v>

869
00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:52.330
<v Speaker 1>of the tropicana screaming at people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a video?</v>

870
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:54.010
<v Speaker 1>I put it up on youtube today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dana.</v>

871
00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Dana white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me know about it.</v>

872
00:42:56.541 --> 00:43:00.500
<v Speaker 1>This culinary union has been trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the ufc out of New York,</v>

873
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 1>new york's the last date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last hold out,</v>

874
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.340
<v Speaker 1>and it's all because of the culinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>union,</v>

875
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:09.370
<v Speaker 1>culinary and spend a shitload of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to consider the station casinos </v>

876
00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:12.911
<v Speaker 1>here because the same company that owns </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ufc own station casinos and they're </v>

877
00:43:12.911 --> 00:43:17.321
<v Speaker 1>non union and in their employees voted </v>
<v Speaker 1>for them to be nonunion allegedly.</v>

878
00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to the information that I've </v>

879
00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.061
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say allegedly I should say </v>

880
00:43:25.061 --> 00:43:25.061
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the best of my knowledge,</v>

881
00:43:25.061 --> 00:43:25.970
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want it to be union.</v>

882
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:28.760
<v Speaker 1>They would have to pay union dues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get paid well by your company,</v>

883
00:43:28.761 --> 00:43:29.990
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

884
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:35.440
<v Speaker 1>use what they were like yelling at </v>
<v Speaker 1>people while these people were going </v>

885
00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.980
<v Speaker 1>into this casino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're telling people not to go in </v>

886
00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:39.140
<v Speaker 1>because the casino's not union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're being bullies.</v>

887
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:42.020
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bullying people that are walking</v>

888
00:43:42.021 --> 00:43:43.190
<v Speaker 1>into the casino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just so.</v>

889
00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:48.220
<v Speaker 1>It's so unfortunate because it used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the unions were there to make sure </v>

890
00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:52.601
<v Speaker 1>that people have a good wage and protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>your rights and make sure that you can </v>

891
00:43:52.601 --> 00:43:53.940
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a fair share of your,</v>

892
00:43:53.941 --> 00:43:55.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your effort.</v>

893
00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.860
<v Speaker 1>That helps build that business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great idea,</v>

894
00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:03.220
<v Speaker 1>but like all great ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they get contaminated with </v>

895
00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:05.450
<v Speaker 1>comments and that's constant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that people found out that it's</v>

896
00:44:05.451 --> 00:44:06.870
<v Speaker 1>a way to make easy money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

897
00:44:06.871 --> 00:44:11.520
<v Speaker 1>the amount of money that they would win </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they had station casinos turned union</v>

898
00:44:11.521 --> 00:44:13.580
<v Speaker 1>is like in the millions and billions a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

899
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:16.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not even as much money as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much money,</v>

900
00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:22.180
<v Speaker 1>but as much as it is money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's power and influence and.</v>

901
00:44:22.761 --> 00:44:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and voting.</v>

902
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really is a national thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember every time because I was </v>

903
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:31.140
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm.</v>

904
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 1>If I had to put</v>

905
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.790
<v Speaker 3>a label on myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm right.</v>

906
00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:34.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

907
00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.540
<v Speaker 3>I would lean conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will lean to the right,</v>

908
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.620
<v Speaker 3>but I don't identify with either party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the union,</v>

909
00:44:40.621 --> 00:44:45.621
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every election would come up and they </v>

910
00:44:45.621 --> 00:44:45.621
<v Speaker 3>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

911
00:44:45.621 --> 00:44:47.931
<v Speaker 3>you got to vote for the democrat no </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter what because if not these </v>

912
00:44:47.931 --> 00:44:48.300
<v Speaker 3>republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna take your job,</v>

913
00:44:48.301 --> 00:44:49.950
<v Speaker 3>they're going to rape your children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

914
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.450
<v Speaker 3>they're going to put your wife in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>basement.</v>

915
00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:56.280
<v Speaker 3>And they were just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were a single issue thing.</v>

916
00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:58.860
<v Speaker 3>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

917
00:44:58.890 --> 00:44:59.550
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

918
00:44:59.551 --> 00:45:01.290
<v Speaker 3>if I vote for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bought from my job,</v>

919
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:04.260
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also a voting against almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else I believe in.</v>

920
00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.060
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I.</v>

921
00:45:06.061 --> 00:45:08.790
<v Speaker 3>And if I don't go that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to call me an asshole.</v>

922
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:12.330
<v Speaker 3>And I'm supposedly a union brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

923
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.970
<v Speaker 3>But if I decided to go a different way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm a prick.</v>

924
00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that becomes a problem in almost any </v>

925
00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:20.480
<v Speaker 1>organization when you have very </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled,</v>

926
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:25.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a controlled environment where </v>

927
00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:25.850
<v Speaker 1>it's not based on the opinion of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>masses you're,</v>

928
00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:29.310
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to go with the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the head of the snake wants to go.</v>

929
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a problem in every single </v>

930
00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:34.340
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you.</v>

931
00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.120
<v Speaker 1>There's some sort of a struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules or sat down,</v>

932
00:45:36.121 --> 00:45:38.910
<v Speaker 1>everything becomes defined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's an ideology.</v>

933
00:45:38.911 --> 00:45:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Now you're part of a tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it goes bad.</v>

934
00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:43.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just we don't do good like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

935
00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:48.000
<v Speaker 1>When it's us versus them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost always,</v>

936
00:45:48.001 --> 00:45:53.001
<v Speaker 1>it turns out shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you've got to realize there's </v>

937
00:45:53.001 --> 00:45:53.001
<v Speaker 1>no them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

938
00:45:53.001 --> 00:45:53.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make everybody us because it's,</v>

939
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
<v Speaker 1>it is possible as a human race to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else doesn't have to be an us </v>

940
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.511
<v Speaker 1>versus them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just you have to find out the </v>

941
00:46:02.511 --> 00:46:02.610
<v Speaker 1>elements of society that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic.</v>

942
00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:04.540
<v Speaker 1>And figuring out how to fix them or root</v>
<v Speaker 1>them out.</v>

943
00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.210
<v Speaker 3>But you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think since time began,</v>

944
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:12.270
<v Speaker 3>somewhere there was a fucking cave man </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing on top of whatever the hill </v>

945
00:46:13.481 --> 00:46:18.481
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had the best shade and the cleanest </v>

946
00:46:18.481 --> 00:46:20.311
<v Speaker 3>water and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's all day if you look </v>

947
00:46:20.531 --> 00:46:25.531
<v Speaker 3>throughout the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean in America we've been able to </v>

948
00:46:25.531 --> 00:46:27.100
<v Speaker 3>pretty it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sand the edges off,</v>

949
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:30.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we make it look nice and uh,</v>

950
00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:32.560
<v Speaker 3>but it's the same shit.</v>

951
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:37.670
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see obama decrying the use of </v>

952
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:40.941
<v Speaker 1>chemical weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about how many motherfuckers have </v>

953
00:46:40.941 --> 00:46:40.941
<v Speaker 1>died by drones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

954
00:46:40.941 --> 00:46:41.310
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>

955
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.370
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

956
00:46:42.371 --> 00:46:47.371
<v Speaker 1>you're doing is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay to use robots to shoot </v>

957
00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:49.410
<v Speaker 1>hellfire missiles from the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not okay to use chemicals.</v>

958
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're being silly,</v>

959
00:46:50.921 --> 00:46:51.530
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

960
00:46:51.531 --> 00:46:52.180
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

961
00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:53.820
<v Speaker 1>and I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

962
00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:54.940
<v Speaker 3>I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

963
00:46:54.941 --> 00:46:59.941
<v Speaker 3>I was really surprised that you got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand it to putin for how he handled that</v>

964
00:47:00.371 --> 00:47:01.600
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's gangsters.</v>

965
00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made obama look like a child.</v>

966
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes it.</v>

967
00:47:04.921 --> 00:47:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Obama look like a child on a regular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

968
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.430
<v Speaker 1>did you hear about the time they met at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this conference?</v>

969
00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:13.431
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to be at this conference </v>
<v Speaker 1>in obama's people wanted the gym at the </v>

970
00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:15.810
<v Speaker 1>same time that putin wanted the gym and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a scheduling conflict,</v>

971
00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:18.300
<v Speaker 1>so putin said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit,</v>

972
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.030
<v Speaker 1>let them have the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he went swimming in the lake,</v>

973
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:26.060
<v Speaker 1>outside of the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pooter jumps in the lake and he's doing </v>

974
00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:29.931
<v Speaker 1>laps in the fucking lake out there with </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature while obama's aerobics scrunchy</v>

975
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:35.230
<v Speaker 3>socks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puente is gangster as fuck.</v>

976
00:47:35.231 --> 00:47:39.160
<v Speaker 3>He goes fly fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bare chested fucking buffaloes.</v>

977
00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:42.010
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a savage and I don't know if that's</v>

978
00:47:42.011 --> 00:47:43.810
<v Speaker 3>good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's good or bad.</v>

979
00:47:43.811 --> 00:47:48.040
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's bad if his enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a great documentary that I think</v>

980
00:47:48.041 --> 00:47:51.560
<v Speaker 3>it's the canadian broadcast cbc did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called the putin.</v>

981
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:52.750
<v Speaker 3>Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putin,</v>

982
00:47:52.751 --> 00:47:57.751
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck his name is the putin </v>
<v Speaker 3>system and it traces his history from </v>

983
00:47:57.911 --> 00:48:02.830
<v Speaker 3>the time he was in college to now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how he got to where he is.</v>

984
00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:06.220
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll get that greetings from Russia,</v>

985
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:08.650
<v Speaker 3>south selfish in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

986
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:14.270
<v Speaker 3>They had some bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And while balding somehow manages to </v>

987
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:15.100
<v Speaker 3>carry it well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that program,</v>

988
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.650
<v Speaker 3>I guess when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

989
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:20.260
<v Speaker 3>in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went to a kgb office and said,</v>

990
00:48:20.261 --> 00:48:23.170
<v Speaker 3>I want to be in the fucking kgb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the kgb said,</v>

991
00:48:23.171 --> 00:48:25.390
<v Speaker 3>we'll tell you he was going to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking kgb,</v>

992
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:28.450
<v Speaker 3>but if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what we're looking for.</v>

993
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:33.430
<v Speaker 3>So he went to college and basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>followed the guidance he was given.</v>

994
00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:38.740
<v Speaker 3>And sure enough they tapped him when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was in college and he went into the kgb,</v>

995
00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:41.980
<v Speaker 3>the old school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is Russia missiles pointed at us,</v>

996
00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:44.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

997
00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:50.920
<v Speaker 3>but that's how you got to start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people that are fucking smarter than</v>

998
00:48:50.921 --> 00:48:54.070
<v Speaker 3>me that have been all over the world and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I paid attention to what they say,</v>

999
00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:59.290
<v Speaker 3>all say that this guy is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1000
00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:04.291
<v Speaker 3>he's going to be a fucking issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at what he's done the </v>

1001
00:49:04.291 --> 00:49:05.470
<v Speaker 3>last 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1002
00:49:05.471 --> 00:49:08.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was president of Russia and then term</v>

1003
00:49:08.831 --> 00:49:10.210
<v Speaker 3>limits kicked in or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

1004
00:49:10.211 --> 00:49:11.470
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't be president,</v>

1005
00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:15.860
<v Speaker 3>I'll be fucking prime minister.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he has a b,</v>

1006
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:16.480
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alexis,</v>

1007
00:49:16.481 --> 00:49:17.580
<v Speaker 3>buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1008
00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.470
<v Speaker 3>president or whatever his term ends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

1009
00:49:20.471 --> 00:49:22.180
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be president again.</v>

1010
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:24.460
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

1011
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:26.980
<v Speaker 3>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1012
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:29.500
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking gangster and he needs to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be respected.</v>

1013
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:34.600
<v Speaker 3>But there's a notice in the us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's this feeling that all,</v>

1014
00:49:34.601 --> 00:49:36.220
<v Speaker 3>he's a cool guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1015
00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.600
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1016
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.250
<v Speaker 3>he's not a cool guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1017
00:49:39.251 --> 00:49:41.550
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of confusion in the us </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's amongst</v>

1018
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.480
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'll call progressive kids.</v>

1019
00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a young people that their heart is </v>

1020
00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:52.741
<v Speaker 1>in the right place and they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have some good ideas about the </v>

1021
00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:58.080
<v Speaker 1>inequalities of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they approached them in a very </v>

1022
00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.841
<v Speaker 1>strange way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people in progressive people will </v>

1023
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:05.910
<v Speaker 1>consistently talk about islamophobia and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will talk about how,</v>

1024
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:07.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1025
00:50:07.451 --> 00:50:12.451
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the restrictions on people's religious </v>

1026
00:50:12.451 --> 00:50:13.470
<v Speaker 1>freedoms that are muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1027
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:14.840
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1028
00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:19.980
<v Speaker 1>that are islamic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is like a really horrendous </v>

1029
00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:25.140
<v Speaker 1>piece of racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet they will openly criticize </v>

1030
00:50:25.211 --> 00:50:26.610
<v Speaker 1>christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1031
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Openly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a mockingly</v>

1032
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.880
<v Speaker 2>criticized mormonism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>openly mockingly criticize in.</v>

1033
00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:37.010
<v Speaker 2>And it's like as any smart person would </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1034
00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.540
<v Speaker 2>blank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1035
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:43.570
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet islam is because these people </v>

1036
00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:45.941
<v Speaker 2>are brown because the idea that they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>been marginalized because many people </v>

1037
00:50:45.941 --> 00:50:46.970
<v Speaker 2>that are from that culture are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent at all,</v>

1038
00:50:46.971 --> 00:50:48.770
<v Speaker 2>just like many christians are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent at all.</v>

1039
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:53.030
<v Speaker 2>And they should not be defined by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most radical,</v>

1040
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:55.010
<v Speaker 2>the most radical aspects of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

1041
00:50:55.011 --> 00:50:57.110
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that wholeheartedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

1042
00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:02.440
<v Speaker 2>But I don't ever see progressive people </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting on people for making fun of </v>

1043
00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:02.440
<v Speaker 2>christians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1044
00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.490
<v Speaker 2>it's directly a part of the program.</v>

1045
00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:06.760
<v Speaker 3>Got to have their whipping boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1046
00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

1047
00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:10.820
<v Speaker 3>That was kind of one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1048
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:17.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems in particular with the whole </v>

1049
00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.860
<v Speaker 3>fucking hipster thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1050
00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:23.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like,</v>

1051
00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:25.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was,</v>

1052
00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.340
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to get into the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1053
00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.040
<v Speaker 3>because I am getting to be an old </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

1054
00:51:29.041 --> 00:51:31.980
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me when I was raised up,</v>

1055
00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:33.000
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1056
00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:38.380
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were taught that it was okay to be </v>

1057
00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:40.330
<v Speaker 3>proud of where you're from or where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>grew up and their struggles and,</v>

1058
00:51:40.331 --> 00:51:42.360
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were taught fucking history,</v>

1059
00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:43.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1060
00:51:43.771 --> 00:51:48.771
<v Speaker 3>I look now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to some kids like high school </v>

1061
00:51:48.771 --> 00:51:49.950
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends of mine's kids that are 13,</v>

1062
00:51:49.951 --> 00:51:51.330
<v Speaker 3>14,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 years old.</v>

1063
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:52.440
<v Speaker 3>And I asked them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1064
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:57.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just about any kind of american history </v>

1065
00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:00.300
<v Speaker 3>and some of the shit they tell me just </v>
<v Speaker 3>blows my fucking mind.</v>

1066
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:03.120
<v Speaker 3>Most of it is what they don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1067
00:52:03.121 --> 00:52:05.280
<v Speaker 3>And then they all know almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1068
00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:09.210
<v Speaker 3>And how it's all being tilted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll tell you,</v>

1069
00:52:09.211 --> 00:52:13.380
<v Speaker 3>here's a perfect fucking example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a great video I was watching and</v>

1070
00:52:13.381 --> 00:52:18.220
<v Speaker 3>it was a guy giving a talk on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>constitution and he asked,</v>

1071
00:52:18.221 --> 00:52:20.950
<v Speaker 3>he had a room full of this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

1072
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.000
<v Speaker 3>a class and a firearm school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've got a bunch of right wing </v>

1073
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:26.760
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1074
00:52:26.761 --> 00:52:30.750
<v Speaker 3>the left would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>god loving gun toting these guys,</v>

1075
00:52:30.751 --> 00:52:33.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constitutional guys.</v>

1076
00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:37.410
<v Speaker 3>You would think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says he starts off in the ass,</v>

1077
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:42.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically named me the four members of </v>

1078
00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.351
<v Speaker 3>the simpsons family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone in that fucking place could </v>

1079
00:52:45.351 --> 00:52:45.660
<v Speaker 3>name him all four members of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>simpsons.</v>

1080
00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:48.510
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now named me the four rights,</v>

1081
00:52:48.511 --> 00:52:53.511
<v Speaker 3>guaranteed you under the first amendment</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the constitution and nobody could do </v>

1082
00:52:53.511 --> 00:52:54.930
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are adults.</v>

1083
00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.780
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could name me three,</v>

1084
00:52:58.230 --> 00:53:00.060
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't taste the fourth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they?</v>

1085
00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:02.280
<v Speaker 3>The right to petition your government </v>
<v Speaker 3>for redress,</v>

1086
00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.800
<v Speaker 3>right to assembly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freedom of the press.</v>

1087
00:53:04.801 --> 00:53:06.600
<v Speaker 3>Freedom of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1088
00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:12.320
<v Speaker 3>Those are the four rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guaranteed you under the first </v>

1089
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:12.320
<v Speaker 3>amendment.</v>

1090
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.340
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it fascinating that even back then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were engineering against tyranny?</v>

1091
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will know.</v>

1092
00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:16.500
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1093
00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:19.920
<v Speaker 2>this kid get back like we have a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea right now and we're,</v>

1094
00:53:19.921 --> 00:53:20.400
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1095
00:53:20.401 --> 00:53:25.401
<v Speaker 2>we're establishing in here right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this could get back if it gets </v>

1096
00:53:25.401 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 2>infected with the very concert it right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1097
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:32.840
<v Speaker 3>Go back and you look at the shit they </v>
<v Speaker 3>did and what happens is everybody,</v>

1098
00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:39.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people on the other side of this </v>

1099
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:39.180
<v Speaker 3>marginalized it because they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1100
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:39.510
<v Speaker 3>well they owned slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1101
00:53:39.511 --> 00:53:39.960
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1102
00:53:39.961 --> 00:53:42.510
<v Speaker 3>Four fifths of a man or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1103
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:46.800
<v Speaker 3>in a marginalized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the good shit by the bad shit.</v>

1104
00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:47.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1105
00:53:47.931 --> 00:53:48.900
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's true.</v>

1106
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of the shit they did didn't make </v>

1107
00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:53.960
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean the shit that they</v>

1108
00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.340
<v Speaker 3>did do that does make sense is </v>
<v Speaker 3>irrelevant.</v>

1109
00:53:56.510 --> 00:54:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make sense today and that's </v>

1110
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:04.001
<v Speaker 2>what people have to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's things that we do today that </v>

1111
00:54:04.001 --> 00:54:05.180
<v Speaker 2>will be considered barbaric a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>years from now.</v>

1112
00:54:05.181 --> 00:54:10.181
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's privatized prisons will be </v>

1113
00:54:10.181 --> 00:54:12.110
<v Speaker 2>looked down upon with incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>contempt and scorn.</v>

1114
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Privatized prisons will go down in </v>
<v Speaker 2>history as one of the most ignored,</v>

1115
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:21.490
<v Speaker 2>horrific injustices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that people can profit and and </v>

1116
00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:26.880
<v Speaker 2>that they can spend their money to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that people get locked up more </v>

1117
00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.220
<v Speaker 2>often so that they can profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly insane.</v>

1118
00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:33.610
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of shit that's going to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>down in our future into the future of </v>

1119
00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:37.721
<v Speaker 2>human beings where this day will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticized openly for human rights </v>

1120
00:54:37.721 --> 00:54:38.290
<v Speaker 2>violations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the shit that we're,</v>

1121
00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:43.320
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about earlier where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're allowing people to work in a </v>

1122
00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:48.011
<v Speaker 2>foreign country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>third world country for a fraction of </v>

1123
00:54:48.011 --> 00:54:48.830
<v Speaker 2>the amount of money that it would take </v>
<v Speaker 2>your key in ensuring poverty,</v>

1124
00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking full advantage on disenfranchised</v>

1125
00:54:51.561 --> 00:54:54.140
<v Speaker 2>human beings that's going to be looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the future upon,</v>

1126
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:55.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to look on that.</v>

1127
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:57.350
<v Speaker 2>That's a horrific thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like slavery,</v>

1128
00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:57.720
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1129
00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.310
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time,</v>

1130
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1131
00:55:00.901 --> 00:55:05.901
<v Speaker 3>if you're a guy in China and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>options are maybe starve to death if the</v>

1132

<v Speaker 3>watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what the fuck it was,</v>

1139
00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:28.360
<v Speaker 3>but a guy wasn't thomas friedman.</v>

1140
00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:34.220

<v Speaker 3>but he was talking about like what's </v>

1141
00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:36.420
<v Speaker 3>going on in China right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the last 100 years of american</v>

1142
00:55:36.421 --> 00:55:39.560
<v Speaker 3>history all going on at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1143
00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:43.110
<v Speaker 3>Because you're going from the grid and </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain parts of the country.</v>

1144
00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:46.010
<v Speaker 3>It's going from an agrarian society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1145
00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.540
<v Speaker 3>to where basically it was almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>subsistence farming,</v>

1146
00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:50.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would raise crops,</v>

1147
00:55:50.341 --> 00:55:51.660
<v Speaker 3>it would sell and that's what they did.</v>

1148
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:55.020
<v Speaker 3>You went up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you work every day so you didn't fucking</v>

1149
00:55:55.021 --> 00:55:58.800
<v Speaker 3>starving the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you've got other parts that are</v>

1150
00:55:58.801 --> 00:56:03.801
<v Speaker 3>going through almost the early 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds with the industrial revolution </v>

1151
00:56:04.231 --> 00:56:09.231
<v Speaker 3>and all the problems go through that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you go to certain parts of it </v>

1152
00:56:09.231 --> 00:56:12.021
<v Speaker 3>and it's cutting edge 21st century </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology and finance and everything </v>

1153
00:56:12.021 --> 00:56:16.791
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you've got all this going on in one </v>

1154
00:56:16.791 --> 00:56:18.450
<v Speaker 3>country and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1155
00:56:18.451 --> 00:56:21.780
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of like a microcosm of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on all over the world.</v>

1156
00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:27.140
<v Speaker 3>When you go to these certain places like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Malaysia or Bangladesh or some of these </v>

1157
00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:28.780
<v Speaker 3>other fucked up countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1158
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:33.160
<v Speaker 3>can you blame a guy for going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so in shoes for a dollar a day,</v>

1159
00:56:33.161 --> 00:56:34.960
<v Speaker 3>if there's another option is to starve </v>
<v Speaker 3>to death.</v>

1160
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1161
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:38.530
<v Speaker 3>I totally is the guy who comes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>brings that job,</v>

1162
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:44.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he a complete fucking asshole for </v>

1165
00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.220

<v Speaker 3>there's that argument.</v>

1166
00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:48.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like many things in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no real black and white.</v>

1167
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:50.350
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the answer.</v>

1168
00:56:50.351 --> 00:56:51.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

1169
00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:55.330
<v Speaker 3>I see if you're a hardcore capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>

1170
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:58.810
<v Speaker 3>and I believe in capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's,</v>

1171
00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:01.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you,</v>

1172
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:06.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the smart that can adapt and </v>

1173
00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:07.420
<v Speaker 3>improvise and adapt will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will prosper.</v>

1174
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:11.070
<v Speaker 3>And if perfect example like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1175
00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was a fucking auto worker and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1176
00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:18.550
<v Speaker 3>it was a mindless job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was retarded how much money they paid</v>

1177
00:57:18.551 --> 00:57:22.870
<v Speaker 3>us to do this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be the first one to tell you $32 an</v>

1178
00:57:22.871 --> 00:57:26.860
<v Speaker 3>hour to take this and go like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean over and over and over.</v>

1179
00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:31.980
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking crazy and benefits better</v>
<v Speaker 3>than almost anyone in the country from </v>

1180
00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:34.960
<v Speaker 3>the time I was born until december of </v>
<v Speaker 3>2006,</v>

1181
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:36.610
<v Speaker 3>almost never paid the doctor bill.</v>

1182
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.000
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I was covered under that </v>

1183
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:42.310
<v Speaker 3>program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

1184
00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:45.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eyeglasses all pretty much free.</v>

1185
00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:47.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just everything.</v>

1186
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:52.710
<v Speaker 3>How much more money must be they've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>making now and they were making back </v>

1187
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:55.730
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The profit margins are supposed to be </v>

1188
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.730
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would think.</v>

1189
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:56.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't kept up with the auto industry</v>

1190
00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:59.890
<v Speaker 3>because it was one of those things to </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I lived it every day,</v>

1191
00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:05.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was you at one point when I was </v>

1192
00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:08.371
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could ask the dumbest toothless </v>

1193
00:58:08.371 --> 00:58:09.670
<v Speaker 3>looking motherfucker on the floor what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stock price that day.</v>

1194
00:58:09.671 --> 00:58:11.830
<v Speaker 3>And he could probably tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1195
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:15.020
<v Speaker 3>Because there was profit sharing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1196
00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:17.680
<v Speaker 3>The stock was up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're getting a check.</v>

1197
00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

1198
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:21.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1199
00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:23.410
<v Speaker 3>and everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1200
00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:28.480
<v Speaker 3>And mexicans not going to get a check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get a dollar an hour and no check.</v>

1201
00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:31.150
<v Speaker 3>The rest of that money goes to us.</v>

1202
00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:32.870
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that they used to tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

1203
00:58:32.871 --> 00:58:37.871
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a fucking mexican auto </v>

1204
00:58:37.871 --> 00:58:40.001
<v Speaker 3>plant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they said that one of the biggest </v>

1205
00:58:40.001 --> 00:58:43.111
<v Speaker 3>differences when you looked at a mexican</v>
<v Speaker 3>autoplant compared to an american </v>

1206
00:58:43.111 --> 00:58:46.390
<v Speaker 3>autoplant mexican auto plants don't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>parking lots because their workers don't</v>

1207
00:58:47.831 --> 00:58:50.690
<v Speaker 3>have cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't drive the bus.</v>

1208
00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:53.890
<v Speaker 3>They bused them in or they want </v>
<v Speaker 3>something happened.</v>

1210
00:58:55.361 --> 00:59:00.361
<v Speaker 3>but something absolutely happen in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>design aspect of american cars where </v>

1211
00:59:00.461 --> 00:59:05.461
<v Speaker 3>they went from the coolest looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking things of all time to shit in 10</v>

<v Speaker 3>fucking cars,</v>

1231
00:59:54.601 --> 00:59:57.570
<v Speaker 1>that was all that harmed the muscle </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>

1232
00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about it today,</v>

1233
00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:01.370
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the way over here,</v>

1234
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:03.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1236
01:00:08.141 --> 01:00:08.141
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1237
01:00:08.141 --> 01:00:10.940
<v Speaker 3>the United States could default on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>debt and we could all end up fucked.</v>

1238
01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:13.010
<v Speaker 3>And you hear all the gloom and doom </v>
<v Speaker 3>scenarios.</v>

1239
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.230
<v Speaker 3>But I was thinking about it and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

1240
01:00:15.231 --> 01:00:18.770
<v Speaker 3>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm old enough to remember gas lines.</v>

1241
01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:20.750
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid.</v>

1242
01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.120
<v Speaker 3>I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I remember that.</v>

1243
01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.740
<v Speaker 3>And I remember people talking about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just,</v>

1244
01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:28.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when everybody was out of work,</v>

1245
01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:30.270
<v Speaker 3>carter was president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1246
01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:32.840
<v Speaker 3>I was born in [inaudible] 73.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I remember,</v>

1247
01:00:32.841 --> 01:00:33.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1248
01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.580
<v Speaker 3>like five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six years old,</v>

1249
01:00:34.581 --> 01:00:37.790
<v Speaker 3>shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1250
01:00:37.791 --> 01:00:39.950
<v Speaker 3>and it's not that bad yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1251
01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:44.980
<v Speaker 3>but the difference is with social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone is so much more connected now </v>

1252
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:50.200
<v Speaker 3>because back then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only time you got your global fix </v>

1253
01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:53.810
<v Speaker 3>was at 30 minutes at night between five </v>
<v Speaker 3>and 5:30</v>

1254
01:00:53.811 --> 01:00:58.811

<v Speaker 1>It must have been so easy to run the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world back then think about it.</v>

1257
01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>And they still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still Got busted with that oliver </v>

<v Speaker 1>even back then,</v>

1259
01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>which is hard to believe because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>must've been so easy to hide shit and It</v>

1260
01:01:14.841 --> 01:01:16.450
<v Speaker 1>still just blew up in their face.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll call it the way of the knife and </v>

1262
01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:24.961
<v Speaker 3>it's a book about how basically like </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about the drone shit and </v>

<v Speaker 3>like they were trying to poison fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>castro and all this other bullshit.</v>

1265
01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.070
<v Speaker 3>And congress basically called them on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1266
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:42.910
<v Speaker 3>So it was at ford,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the president,</v>

1267
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:48.390
<v Speaker 3>but basically wrote the presidential </v>
<v Speaker 3>order that says no fucking </v>

<v Speaker 3>like 20 years.</v>

1285
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:44.670
<v Speaker 3>One of the most intelligent dudes I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever met.</v>

<v Speaker 3>in Pakistan and then when obama came in,</v>

1296
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.790
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a fucking target list.</v>

1297
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:25.710
<v Speaker 3>There's a list that if your fucking name</v>
<v Speaker 3>is on it and you're in Pakistan,</v>

1298
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.860
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1299

<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1300
01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Find out Where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Missiles are coming from the sky and you</v>

1301
01:03:32.981 --> 01:03:37.981
<v Speaker 1>ain't gonna make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times fucking obama asked </v>

1302
01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>to check off on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1303
01:03:38.741 --> 01:03:43.741
<v Speaker 1>And the amount of people that get killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're supposed to kill versus the </v>

1304
01:03:43.741 --> 01:03:44.860
<v Speaker 1>amount of people that accidentally get </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

1305
01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a shocking number?</v>

1306
01:03:48.050 --> 01:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>But 98 percent the wrong people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>

1307
01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1308
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what I've read.</v>

1309
01:03:56.890 --> 01:03:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously I'm not out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking counting bodies.</v>

1310
01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not giving you the most accurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>readings humanly possible.</v>

1311
01:04:03.161 --> 01:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting it based on a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things I've read online,</v>

1312
01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:07.260
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean sources.</v>

1313
01:04:08.170 --> 01:04:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I could see that</v>

1314
01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:11.470
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of fuck ups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's in the nineties.</v>

1315
01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:16.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to guess that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know maybe,</v>

1316
01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:22.060
<v Speaker 3>but I could definitely see six guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>being in a car.</v>

1317
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:26.060
<v Speaker 1>One of them being the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1318
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:28.130
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of guilt by association </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

1319
01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.980
<v Speaker 1>there is no doubt about that and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about that.</v>

1320
01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:35.070
<v Speaker 1>If they get a chance to take you out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you happen to be with your friends,</v>

1321
01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.940
<v Speaker 1>this is a time of war and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna miss out on that opportunity.</v>

1322
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:44.250
<v Speaker 1>The certain amount of casualties that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are factored into every war and that's </v>

1323
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:45.510
<v Speaker 1>just a fact of life and if you're a key </v>
<v Speaker 1>target,</v>

1324
01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:47.760
<v Speaker 1>that's a rap song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have this new thing.</v>

1325
01:04:47.761 --> 01:04:50.460
<v Speaker 1>It's called a drone shoots hellfire </v>
<v Speaker 1>missiles.</v>

1326
01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hellfire missile.</v>

1327
01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Hellfire missile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gangster motherfuckers.</v>

1328
01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.090
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the things that</v>

1329
01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:02.380
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about in this book on </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how they were able,</v>

1330
01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:08.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan has been playing in the United </v>

1331
01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:10.500
<v Speaker 3>States since the shift began because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean the taliban was created by fucking </v>

1332
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:15.271
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought the taliban came out of the </v>

1333
01:05:15.271 --> 01:05:18.001
<v Speaker 3>mujahideen know the taliban was </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically created and by the isi.</v>

1334
01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:21.340
<v Speaker 3>Did al qaeda come out of the mujahideen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1335
01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:24.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean the taliban is a branch of al </v>
<v Speaker 3>qaeda,</v>

1336
01:05:24.641 --> 01:05:25.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1337
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:30.390
<v Speaker 3>The taliban taliban was set up basically</v>
<v Speaker 3>by Pakistan to after,</v>

1338
01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:35.410
<v Speaker 3>after Russia pulled out of Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking nobody to run it.</v>

1339
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:40.330
<v Speaker 3>It's warlords and wild west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The isi,</v>

1340
01:05:40.331 --> 01:05:45.130
<v Speaker 3>the pakistani intelligence service put </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and backed this group.</v>

1341
01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:47.560
<v Speaker 3>They call themselves the taliban.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically.</v>

1342
01:05:47.561 --> 01:05:51.730
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentalist guys helped them gain </v>
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>

1343
01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:56.610
<v Speaker 3>consolidate power in Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason was the biggest thing,</v>

1344
01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:59.560
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan doesn't give a fuck about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan,</v>

1345
01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 3>about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing they give a shit about is</v>

1346
01:06:01.601 --> 01:06:02.050
<v Speaker 3>India.</v>

1347
01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:08.280
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan is scared to fucking death of </v>
<v Speaker 3>India and if we see a nuclear war and </v>

1348
01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:11.951
<v Speaker 3>our time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will probably be between India and </v>

1349
01:06:11.951 --> 01:06:13.090
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan is my bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so what they didn't want.</v>

1350
01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.540
<v Speaker 3>If you look at a map,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the fuck is Afghanistan?</v>

1351
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:22.030
<v Speaker 3>India's here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>afghanistan's on the back door of </v>

1352
01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what?</v>

1353
01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:26.461
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan doesn't want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they can afford is to have an </v>

1354
01:06:26.461 --> 01:06:28.000
<v Speaker 3>indian client state and have India on </v>
<v Speaker 3>borders.</v>

1355
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:31.480
<v Speaker 3>So the taliban was there a way around </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1356
01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:37.050
<v Speaker 3>The taliban ran controlled Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't run it because there's parts</v>

1357
01:06:38.171 --> 01:06:40.600
<v Speaker 3>of that fucking country that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>run.</v>

1358
01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:46.080
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was what the taliban was </v>

1359
01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:46.480
<v Speaker 3>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're strong man that they put in.</v>

1360
01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:52.080
<v Speaker 3>Well they fucked up when bin laden came </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and they sheltered him and did all </v>

1361
01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:55.861
<v Speaker 3>this shit and they pissed off America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now here comes America in october of </v>

1362
01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:01.930
<v Speaker 3>2001 and just raise holy hell goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets the northern alliance,</v>

1363
01:07:01.931 --> 01:07:02.830
<v Speaker 3>pushes them out.</v>

1364
01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:06.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during all this shit was going on,</v>

1365
01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:11.640
<v Speaker 3>pakistan's flying fucking taliban </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaders out before they can get captured</v>

1366
01:07:12.071 --> 01:07:14.830
<v Speaker 3>by the us the whole time they're telling</v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

1367
01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.880
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go get this guy,</v>

1368
01:07:15.881 --> 01:07:20.881
<v Speaker 3>go get that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Pakistan has always given up the </v>

1369
01:07:20.881 --> 01:07:24.451
<v Speaker 3>aiccu guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the conspiracy theory side is </v>

1370
01:07:24.451 --> 01:07:25.510
<v Speaker 3>that the government allowed those people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to leave.</v>

1371
01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:26.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1372
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's kind of everybody I know.</v>

1373
01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:35.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean they talked to you guys and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is all a part of their relationship </v>

1374
01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:35.960
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1375
01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:37.640
<v Speaker 3>they they want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1376
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:40.750
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll give up the foreign fighters,</v>

1377
01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:43.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the assholes that are coming in,</v>

1378
01:07:43.331 --> 01:07:45.040
<v Speaker 3>the al qaeda guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

1379
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:50.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean they've proven that they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>captured al qaeda guys and turned them </v>

1380
01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:51.310
<v Speaker 3>over to the us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have a history of that.</v>

1381
01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:56.340
<v Speaker 3>They have a hIstory of throwing us a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bone because they know they can't just </v>

1382
01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:57.190
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be one of the other.</v>

1383
01:07:57.250 --> 01:08:02.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's a lot of profit in </v>

1384
01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:05.371
<v Speaker 3>war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if it stays active and I </v>

1385
01:08:05.371 --> 01:08:09.631
<v Speaker 3>think the idea of completely resolving </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the issues that you have in ending </v>

1386
01:08:09.631 --> 01:08:11.620
<v Speaker 3>the war is not very profitable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a fact.</v>

1387
01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:15.100
<v Speaker 3>There's look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most profitable things ever.</v>

1388
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:16.460
<v Speaker 3>The history of humanity</v>

1389
01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.150
<v Speaker 2>is the drug war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1390
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.800
<v Speaker 2>The drug war does not have an ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

1391
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.300
<v Speaker 2>there's no resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never gonna happen.</v>

1392
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:26.140
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to stop people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially with the hypocrite,</v>

1393
01:08:26.141 --> 01:08:31.141
<v Speaker 2>a lot hypocritical attitude that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a culture where we allow certain </v>

1394
01:08:31.141 --> 01:08:35.171
<v Speaker 2>drugs and often those drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more dangerous ones we allow those </v>

1395
01:08:35.171 --> 01:08:36.680
<v Speaker 2>to be legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the more peaceful,</v>

1396
01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:41.860
<v Speaker 2>enlightening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opening drugs that allow you to step </v>

1397
01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:44.960
<v Speaker 2>outside of your normal predetermined </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns of behavior and sort of look at</v>

1398
01:08:44.961 --> 01:08:47.810
<v Speaker 2>the world for what it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the ones that are Illegal.</v>

1399
01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:52.960
<v Speaker 2>It's a clear sign of a society repressed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when a society's repressed it </v>

1400
01:08:53.241 --> 01:08:55.850
<v Speaker 2>fucking results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a freak out</v>

1401
01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.000
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it all comes down.</v>

1402
01:08:58.001 --> 01:09:01.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>substance or item,</v>

1403
01:09:01.570 --> 01:09:05.670
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is that the government says </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't have it.</v>

1404
01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.050
<v Speaker 3>It's about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1405
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:09.940
<v Speaker 3>like I'm a gun guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's my issue.</v>

1406
01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gun control is not about guns.</v>

1407
01:09:12.791 --> 01:09:14.860
<v Speaker 3>It's about control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same.</v>

1408
01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.750
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we get some supplies?</v>

1409
01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:19.350
<v Speaker 3>It's the same shit with drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1410
01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:23.260
<v Speaker 3>And what's crazy to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what blows my fucking mind?</v>

1411
01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1412
01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:28.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm driving today from vegas.</v>

1413
01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:34.060
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this arbitrary fucking line in </v>

1414
01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:34.660
<v Speaker 3>the desert between Nevada and </v>
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

1415
01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:37.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now in Nevada,</v>

1416
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:40.750
<v Speaker 3>I have a concealed carry permit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can carry a gun legally,</v>

1417
01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.450
<v Speaker 3>exercise my second amendment right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit,</v>

1418
01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.740
<v Speaker 3>but I have to pay money and go through a</v>
<v Speaker 3>class and to jump through these hoops to</v>

1419
01:09:47.741 --> 01:09:52.741
<v Speaker 3>exercise this right in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can exercise it if I play their </v>

1420
01:09:52.741 --> 01:09:53.140
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1421
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:55.150
<v Speaker 3>if I'm standing on this side of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>

1422
01:09:55.210 --> 01:09:58.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm 100 percent fucking illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I step over this line,</v>

1423
01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:04.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to jail for for the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's the same way with drugs.</v>

1424
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:10.110
<v Speaker 3>If you got a bag of weed in California </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've got the right card from the </v>

1425
01:10:10.571 --> 01:10:12.280
<v Speaker 3>right doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're straight.</v>

1426
01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you go to Texas,</v>

1427
01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:18.740
<v Speaker 2>they will fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are you.</v>

1428
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Are you in favor of any laws as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>like regulation of who gets firearms?</v>

1429
01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.090
<v Speaker 2>I think we've got plenty man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you.</v>

1430
01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:29.870
<v Speaker 2>You are in favor of background checks </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit like that?</v>

1431
01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:31.330
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1432
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:34.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say.</v>

1433
01:10:34.271 --> 01:10:35.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't.</v>

1434
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.440
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such a gun nut?</v>

1435
01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:40.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say most people at right home,</v>

1436
01:10:40.501 --> 01:10:42.880
<v Speaker 2>like all the liberal freaks right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1437
01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:46.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm no hero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she slept 69 on whether,</v>

1438
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

1439
01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.730
<v Speaker 3>mean I can see it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't,</v>

1440
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:51.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't disagree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's,</v>

1441
01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:57.580
<v Speaker 3>if I could rule the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have no problem with instant </v>

1442
01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:58.280
<v Speaker 3>background checks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't cost a dime.</v>

1443
01:10:58.930 --> 01:11:02.480
<v Speaker 3>Like now up until in las vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Nevada,</v>

1444
01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:06.380
<v Speaker 3>if you buy a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it costs you $25 to pay for a background</v>

1445
01:11:06.381 --> 01:11:07.940
<v Speaker 3>check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now.</v>

1446
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.830
<v Speaker 3>That background check consists of </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone in a government office somewhere</v>

1447
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.930
<v Speaker 3>typing your name and the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1448
01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:16.730
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1449
01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:19.950
<v Speaker 3>and if you get a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll deny you and then you have three</v>

1450
01:11:19.951 --> 01:11:23.490
<v Speaker 3>days to appeal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't,</v>

1451
01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:26.490
<v Speaker 3>they say he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're against the fact that it costs</v>

1452
01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:29.370
<v Speaker 3>25 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That and the fact I don't have a problem</v>

1453
01:11:29.371 --> 01:11:31.080
<v Speaker 3>with instant checks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's fair.</v>

1454
01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:31.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1455
01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.570
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do agree with that.</v>

1456
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:38.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I have a problem with is the </v>

1457
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:40.590
<v Speaker 3>fact that you loved guns.</v>

1458
01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:41.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

1459
01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:45.030
<v Speaker 3>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the fact that if I,</v>

1460
01:11:45.031 --> 01:11:46.740
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I charged you,</v>

1461
01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:53.140
<v Speaker 3>I dunno if I charged you a fee for every</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast you put up because you're </v>

1462
01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:55.020
<v Speaker 3>exercising your first amendment right </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we have to make sure joe,</v>

1463
01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:59.470
<v Speaker 3>that you're using this right correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're not inciting any violence or</v>

1464
01:11:59.471 --> 01:12:01.640
<v Speaker 3>are trying to incite any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1465
01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.930
<v Speaker 3>you could do any damage to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>establishment.</v>

1466
01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:06.630
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1467
01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:12.020
<v Speaker 3>but to me it comes down to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one thing I have a big problem with </v>

1468
01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.680
<v Speaker 3>and it's something that if you're not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gun guy,</v>

1469
01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.930
<v Speaker 3>you'd never even fucking pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1470
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:19.380
<v Speaker 3>but it's this thing called the nfa </v>
<v Speaker 3>national firearms act,</v>

1471
01:12:19.381 --> 01:12:22.390
<v Speaker 3>the registry and what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1472
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:25.200
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's these arbitrary laws that say,</v>

1473
01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.830
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to own a suppressor silencer</v>

1474
01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:31.110
<v Speaker 3>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a fully automatic weapon,</v>

1475
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:32.610
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1476
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:34.620
<v Speaker 3>you can do that.</v>

1477
01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:40.010
<v Speaker 3>If it's legal in your state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're perfectly fine to be able to do </v>

1478
01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:43.491
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you have to pay the government 200 </v>

1479
01:12:43.491 --> 01:12:45.270
<v Speaker 3>bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you pay the government 200 bucks,</v>

1480
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:50.390
<v Speaker 3>we'll give you this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also you have to give up the right </v>

1481
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:55.131
<v Speaker 3>to let anybody from the atf come into </v>
<v Speaker 3>your home anytime they want to check on </v>

1482
01:12:55.131 --> 01:12:57.720
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you do this,</v>

1483
01:12:57.870 --> 01:13:00.480
<v Speaker 3>you can have this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have fucking damn near anything.</v>

1484
01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:04.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean machine guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 caliber machine guns,</v>

1485
01:13:04.201 --> 01:13:09.201
<v Speaker 3>you can add anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know guys that have got any fucking </v>

1486
01:13:09.201 --> 01:13:10.470
<v Speaker 3>thing you can dream up as long as you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to pay the government.</v>

1487
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:14.130
<v Speaker 3>Now to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's bullshit.</v>

1488
01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.230
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see the point.</v>

1489
01:13:16.231 --> 01:13:19.050
<v Speaker 3>But I also see the point that you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to regulate.</v>

1490
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:24.110
<v Speaker 3>You have to keep aware of who the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking crazy people are because that's </v>

1491
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.110
<v Speaker 3>the problem that many people.</v>

1492
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:25.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a problem with keeping guns</v>
<v Speaker 3>away from naughty people.</v>

1493
01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:30.801
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you have to have employees that do </v>

1494
01:13:30.801 --> 01:13:30.801
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have got.</v>

1495
01:13:30.801 --> 01:13:30.801
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

1496
01:13:30.801 --> 01:13:32.580
<v Speaker 3>It cost money to do so let's do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But are we doing that now?</v>

1497
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:33.960
<v Speaker 3>We're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1498
01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:36.480
<v Speaker 3>You know why you can't keep guns away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from 90 people?</v>

1499
01:13:36.481 --> 01:13:38.760
<v Speaker 3>Because medical records are restricted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1500
01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:41.550
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you can keep some guns away from</v>

1501
01:13:41.551 --> 01:13:43.470
<v Speaker 3>somebody in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1502
01:13:43.471 --> 01:13:48.471
<v Speaker 3>the only way is if they're adjudicated </v>
<v Speaker 3>by a judge and there's a public record </v>

1503
01:13:48.471 --> 01:13:51.720
<v Speaker 3>of it and it goes into a record,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most cases,</v>

1504
01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:54.090
<v Speaker 3>like all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost all these shootings,</v>

1505
01:13:54.150 --> 01:13:59.150
<v Speaker 3>like if you look at all of this is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>fires people up about guns is the mass </v>

1506
01:13:59.161 --> 01:14:01.890
<v Speaker 3>shootings and it's completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>understandable.</v>

1507
01:14:02.490 --> 01:14:07.490
<v Speaker 3>But for most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the guys who were doing </v>

1508
01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:09.900
<v Speaker 3>these shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're nuts.</v>

1509
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:11.080
<v Speaker 3>They're fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1510
01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:16.090
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you start looking at the number of </v>

1511
01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:16.240
<v Speaker 3>people who do these shootings that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>on some type of drug,</v>

1512
01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.460
<v Speaker 3>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1513
01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.240
<v Speaker 3>so if we're really trying to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1514
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:26.310
<v Speaker 3>are we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we going after the tool or are we </v>

1515
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:28.981
<v Speaker 3>trying to stop the tool?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we trying to stop the act because </v>

1516
01:14:28.981 --> 01:14:29.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which one is it?</v>

1517
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very good point.</v>

1518
01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:33.940
<v Speaker 3>I've said it many times and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1519
01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:37.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably not the right guy to get up</v>

1520
01:14:37.211 --> 01:14:39.700
<v Speaker 3>here and talk about what should and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be with guns.</v>

1521
01:14:39.701 --> 01:14:40.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1522
01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:41.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

1523
01:14:41.931 --> 01:14:45.490
<v Speaker 3>I'll be the first to admit I'm biased,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also the same guy that was stand</v>

1524
01:14:45.491 --> 01:14:50.491
<v Speaker 3>up here and tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think every drug on earth should be </v>

1525
01:14:50.491 --> 01:14:50.491
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>

1526
01:14:50.491 --> 01:14:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I mean when you say </v>

1527
01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:54.220
<v Speaker 2>you're not the right guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I believe.</v>

1528
01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I believe there is no right guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that your ideas of what should </v>

1529
01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:02.801
<v Speaker 2>and should be legal or different than </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people's ideas and what you'll </v>

1530
01:15:02.801 --> 01:15:04.850
<v Speaker 2>tolerate are different than things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than people who,</v>

1531
01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:09.560
<v Speaker 2>you know otherwise would have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreements with you about everything,</v>

1532
01:15:09.561 --> 01:15:14.561
<v Speaker 2>but there might be certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain behaviors that you're used to </v>

1533
01:15:14.561 --> 01:15:15.710
<v Speaker 2>that they can't handle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are fucking different.</v>

1534
01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1535
01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any right or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

1536
01:15:18.321 --> 01:15:23.321
<v Speaker 2>but I think the real issue is a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you who's not a bad guy who is a gun </v>

1537
01:15:25.251 --> 01:15:30.251
<v Speaker 2>enthusiast also realizes he's aware that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of fucking bad things in </v>

1538
01:15:30.251 --> 01:15:34.781
<v Speaker 2>the world and I would rather be </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected than not be protected very </v>

1539
01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:34.781
<v Speaker 2>simply.</v>

1540
01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:37.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my then there in lies probably my,</v>

1541
01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:39.630
<v Speaker 3>that's your number one beef.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1542
01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:43.770
<v Speaker 3>my thing is I do not expect the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government to protect me.</v>

1543
01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:45.540
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not their job.</v>

1544
01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:47.340
<v Speaker 3>It's you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the,</v>

1545
01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:49.500
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get robbed,</v>

1546
01:15:49.501 --> 01:15:50.490
<v Speaker 3>raped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beaten,</v>

1547
01:15:50.491 --> 01:15:55.491
<v Speaker 3>or killed your family or you cannot sue </v>
<v Speaker 3>the police because they didn't protect </v>

1548
01:15:55.771 --> 01:15:58.650
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the police's job.</v>

1549
01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:02.340
<v Speaker 3>It's not the state's job to protect you </v>
<v Speaker 3>as an individual.</v>

1550
01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.970
<v Speaker 3>You can't sue the cops if you get beat </v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1551
01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:11.720
<v Speaker 3>if you get attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get shot because they weren't </v>

1552
01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.910
<v Speaker 3>there to protect you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot do that because that is,</v>

1553
01:16:14.010 --> 01:16:16.800
<v Speaker 3>that's not their job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to me,</v>

1554
01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got no problem with that.</v>

1555
01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:22.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't expect it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if that's the case,</v>

1556
01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:28.580
<v Speaker 3>don't restrict me from my ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take care of myself and my family and </v>

1557
01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:33.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't restrict me from having the tools </v>

1558
01:16:33.710 --> 01:16:36.360
<v Speaker 3>to do that and be that whatever that </v>
<v Speaker 3>tool could be.</v>

1559
01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The onLy issue is only in people who are</v>

1560
01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:43.540
<v Speaker 2>psychotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are criminals,</v>

1561
01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:45.700
<v Speaker 2>who are either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only issue.</v>

1562
01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:46.520
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was.</v>

1563
01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:47.670
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>

1564
01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:50.660
<v Speaker 3>you touch an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big thing with me is criminals.</v>

1565
01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect example.</v>

1566
01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Most of these shootings that have taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>place have taken place.</v>

1567
01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.200
<v Speaker 3>Almost all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if the gun was bought legally,</v>

1568
01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:06.020
<v Speaker 3>you know the guns were banned in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>theater in Colorado,</v>

1569
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:07.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the military,</v>

1570
01:17:07.371 --> 01:17:11.120
<v Speaker 3>the shooting that just took place at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>navy gun free zone.</v>

1571
01:17:11.610 --> 01:17:15.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm new town at school,</v>

1572
01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1573
01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:21.600
<v Speaker 3>and in Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a parent driving to pick up </v>

1574
01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.060
<v Speaker 3>your son or daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just pick them up in the school,</v>

1575
01:17:23.061 --> 01:17:28.061
<v Speaker 3>as soon as you enter that school yard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if even if you're a licensed ccw </v>

1576
01:17:28.061 --> 01:17:29.330
<v Speaker 3>carrier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've jumped through every hoop.</v>

1577
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:32.660
<v Speaker 3>The stAte says you have to jump through </v>
<v Speaker 3>a background check,</v>

1578
01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:37.690
<v Speaker 3>a training course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an actual proficiency tests where you </v>

1579
01:17:37.690 --> 01:17:39.530
<v Speaker 3>have to shoot your gun for score if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>do all those actions,</v>

1580
01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:43.370
<v Speaker 3>but yet you drive onto the school </v>
<v Speaker 3>grounds to pick up your child.</v>

1581
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:48.370
<v Speaker 3>You never get out of your car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have the gun on you or in your </v>

1582
01:17:48.370 --> 01:17:48.370
<v Speaker 3>car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a criminal.</v>

1583
01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:51.830
<v Speaker 3>You cannot bring a gun onto that school </v>
<v Speaker 3>premises.</v>

1584
01:17:51.831 --> 01:17:53.720
<v Speaker 3>You can't even have it in your car when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you pick up your kid.</v>

1585
01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.720
<v Speaker 3>So now to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm a parent,</v>

1586
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:58.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have kids,</v>

1587
01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:03.550
<v Speaker 3>but if I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be a criminal because of </v>

1588
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:06.500
<v Speaker 3>some asshole starts to shoot up a school</v>
<v Speaker 3>or somewhere,</v>

1589
01:18:06.501 --> 01:18:08.370
<v Speaker 3>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1590
01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:12.710
<v Speaker 3>I at least I'm not the guy sitting here </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying a gun's going to solve everything</v>

1591
01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:17.390
<v Speaker 3>because chances are it's probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's an option you have.</v>

1592
01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:19.460
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have the option.</v>

1593
01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.170
<v Speaker 3>You know whAt you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a sheep.</v>

1594
01:18:21.171 --> 01:18:26.171
<v Speaker 3>Just hoping you don't get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know if you have an option to fight </v>

1595
01:18:26.171 --> 01:18:30.251
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if the state says you do not have </v>

1596
01:18:30.251 --> 01:18:32.420
<v Speaker 3>that option,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must sit there and take.</v>

1597
01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:36.470
<v Speaker 3>You must be a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where I have a problem.</v>

1598
01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:39.620
<v Speaker 1>The problem is the reality of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we live in.</v>

1599
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:44.830
<v Speaker 1>The problem is not the utopian </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities of everybody being </v>

1600
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:46.640
<v Speaker 1>completely gun free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real problem with the idea of</v>

1601
01:18:46.641 --> 01:18:48.190
<v Speaker 1>gun control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that like,</v>

1602
01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:50.840
<v Speaker 1>who's going to control who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that abide by our laws.</v>

1603
01:18:50.841 --> 01:18:55.841
<v Speaker 1>Do you really think that there's enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out there to go out there and </v>

1604
01:18:55.841 --> 01:18:56.190
<v Speaker 1>find the fucking guns that are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's homes and.</v>

1605
01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:56.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1606
01:18:56.911 --> 01:18:57.880
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's number one.</v>

1607
01:18:57.881 --> 01:19:02.881
<v Speaker 3>It's completely impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you pass the law tomorrow and said </v>

1608
01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:07.780
<v Speaker 3>guns are illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't build prisons fast enough.</v>

1609
01:19:08.050 --> 01:19:13.000
<v Speaker 3>It just makes criminals out of regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and it's to me,</v>

1610
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:16.180
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm of the opinion that,</v>

1611
01:19:17.230 --> 01:19:22.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't stop a guy from being an </v>

1612
01:19:22.230 --> 01:19:22.230
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1613
01:19:22.230 --> 01:19:25.870
<v Speaker 3>it's not even just an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a rabid dog,</v>

1614
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:30.990
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if something like this shit is </v>

1615
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:35.161
<v Speaker 3>gonna happen man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the two things I </v>

1616
01:19:35.161 --> 01:19:36.790
<v Speaker 3>think the drugs have a part to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it bigger than people give credit for.</v>

1617
01:19:36.850 --> 01:19:40.060
<v Speaker 3>I really believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing is I think the media</v>

1618
01:19:40.061 --> 01:19:45.061
<v Speaker 3>feeds it because they give these </v>
<v Speaker 3>assholes instant celebrity and you see </v>

1619
01:19:45.971 --> 01:19:50.050
<v Speaker 3>this and I think these breach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect example man.</v>

1620
01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:53.680
<v Speaker 3>Chris dorner were you and la when this </v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole was running around?</v>

1621
01:19:53.770 --> 01:19:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wrote a goddamn.</v>

1622
01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:59.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that dude freaky shit ever.</v>

1623
01:19:59.950 --> 01:20:01.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was.</v>

1624
01:20:01.331 --> 01:20:06.331
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't like my buddy for folks who </v>

1625
01:20:06.331 --> 01:20:06.331
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1626
01:20:06.331 --> 01:20:06.331
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1627
01:20:06.331 --> 01:20:06.331
<v Speaker 3>I killed</v>

1628
01:20:06.331 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 1>the cop's kid and her boyfriend,</v>

1629
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.650
<v Speaker 3>her boyfriend and killed a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cops,</v>

1630
01:20:10.651 --> 01:20:15.000
<v Speaker 3>like pulled up to the red lights and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot up to two different incidents.</v>

1631
01:20:15.001 --> 01:20:20.001
<v Speaker 3>He shot up cops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he might've killed one cop and </v>

1632
01:20:20.001 --> 01:20:22.520
<v Speaker 3>he was a former police officer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was fired and where lapd guy decided </v>

1633
01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.430
<v Speaker 3>he was going on in fucking rap and a but</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a,</v>

1634
01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:27.780
<v Speaker 3>on a rampage rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was,</v>

1635
01:20:27.810 --> 01:20:31.830
<v Speaker 3>he was a navy guy as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this dude,</v>

1636
01:20:31.831 --> 01:20:34.530
<v Speaker 3>I had met him actually in a gun store in</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegas.</v>

1637
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:39.830
<v Speaker 3>He used to hang out or not hanging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you'd call it hanging </v>

1638
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:42.411
<v Speaker 3>out or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was a where I bought a lot of </v>

1639
01:20:42.411 --> 01:20:43.590
<v Speaker 3>stuff in las vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1640
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.860
<v Speaker 3>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he bought shit from there as well.</v>

1641
01:20:46.861 --> 01:20:51.861
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the shit that he used in his </v>

1642
01:20:51.861 --> 01:20:51.861
<v Speaker 3>little rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1643
01:20:51.861 --> 01:20:53.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I saw him on the news,</v>

1644
01:20:53.821 --> 01:20:54.570
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>god damn,</v>

1645
01:20:54.571 --> 01:20:55.980
<v Speaker 3>that dude looks familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1646
01:20:56.310 --> 01:21:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Because when I saw him in vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always assumed he was military because</v>

1647
01:21:00.331 --> 01:21:05.331
<v Speaker 3>they get a lot of military guys in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>because nellis and some of the other </v>

1648
01:21:05.331 --> 01:21:08.661
<v Speaker 3>basis that around vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of military guys come in and do </v>

1649
01:21:08.661 --> 01:21:08.661
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1650
01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:09.840
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1651
01:21:09.841 --> 01:21:14.841
<v Speaker 3>that guy looks familiar and sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend who was a manager at that </v>

1652
01:21:14.841 --> 01:21:14.841
<v Speaker 3>store called me up and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1653
01:21:14.841 --> 01:21:16.860
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking chris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sold him that shit.</v>

1654
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:23.360
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went through all the legal </v>

1655
01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:23.400
<v Speaker 3>requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1656
01:21:23.401 --> 01:21:27.090
<v Speaker 3>And not only did he go through the legal</v>
<v Speaker 3>requirement of just a background check,</v>

1657
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:32.420
<v Speaker 3>he went through the shit I told you </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what you have to pay out $200 tax </v>

1658
01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.270
<v Speaker 3>stamp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the other trick right now,</v>

1659
01:21:33.271 --> 01:21:35.820
<v Speaker 3>the backlog on that is six to nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>months long.</v>

1660
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:39.120
<v Speaker 3>So to buy a short barreled rifle or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>suppressor,</v>

1661
01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:42.090
<v Speaker 3>so you can go in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you pay for this shit,</v>

1662
01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:47.810
<v Speaker 3>you pay your $200 to the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you wait six months and it </v>

1663
01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:49.020
<v Speaker 3>takes them that long to do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>paperwork.</v>

1664
01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:54.730
<v Speaker 3>And then they send the stamp back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a tax stamp and they send it back </v>

1665
01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:57.900
<v Speaker 3>and then you can have whatever the hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is that you paid for it,</v>

1666
01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:03.150
<v Speaker 3>but this guy did that so he can't get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1667
01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:08.780
<v Speaker 3>this crazy bastard went through the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>strenuous process the federal government</v>

1668
01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:15.080
<v Speaker 3>comes up with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the process they have for selling </v>

1669
01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:18.170
<v Speaker 3>fully automatic weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went through that and he passed at </v>

1670
01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:22.221
<v Speaker 3>all and there was no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing in this guy's past </v>

1671
01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:25.290
<v Speaker 3>that would have thrown up a red flag for</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1672
01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:30.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had security clearances through the </v>

1673
01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:30.860
<v Speaker 3>military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a goddamn lapd cop,</v>

1674
01:22:31.170 --> 01:22:34.350
<v Speaker 3>but he was fired from the lapd for </v>
<v Speaker 3>excessive violence.</v>

1675
01:22:34.351 --> 01:22:37.020
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what I understand,</v>

1676
01:22:37.050 --> 01:22:41.040
<v Speaker 3>he was fired because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember right,</v>

1677
01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.890
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean look it up,</v>

1678
01:22:43.891 --> 01:22:48.891
<v Speaker 3>but he was fired because his training </v>
<v Speaker 3>officer basically said he wasn't </v>

1679
01:22:49.411 --> 01:22:54.411
<v Speaker 3>suitable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what I understood was that he </v>

1680
01:22:54.411 --> 01:22:54.411
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>

1681
01:22:54.411 --> 01:22:56.070
<v Speaker 3>Was it false complaint?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>

1682
01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:59.370
<v Speaker 3>He went to his bosses and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1683
01:22:59.730 --> 01:23:03.660
<v Speaker 3>his partner had used a unnecessary force</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever.</v>

1684
01:23:03.690 --> 01:23:04.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1685
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:09.590
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's done necessary force and then he </v>

1686
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:11.911
<v Speaker 3>ratted somebody out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he ratted out and then the department </v>

1687
01:23:11.911 --> 01:23:11.911
<v Speaker 3>fired him because they said he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>lying,</v>

1688
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:15.610
<v Speaker 3>but it turns out he wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

1689
01:23:15.611 --> 01:23:18.670
<v Speaker 3>that's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took her a regular,</v>

1690
01:23:18.671 --> 01:23:23.530
<v Speaker 3>like super cop turned him into a killer </v>
<v Speaker 3>with one little case like that.</v>

1691
01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:28.531
<v Speaker 3>But that was what was kind of funny was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the media was playing this guy up as </v>

1692
01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.700
<v Speaker 3>some kind of super trained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1693
01:23:31.710 --> 01:23:36.710
<v Speaker 3>he was john rambo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at the shit he did and </v>

1694
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:37.710
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1695
01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:41.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm fortunate through shooting and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>other things that I've done,</v>

1696
01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:46.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know and have some friends and the </v>

1697
01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:48.120
<v Speaker 3>community of guys soft guys and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and things like that.</v>

1698
01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:52.160
<v Speaker 3>soft guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sof is an acronym for special operations</v>

1699
01:23:52.161 --> 01:23:57.161
<v Speaker 3>forces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of as the acronym that 99 </v>

1700
01:23:57.161 --> 01:23:57.161
<v Speaker 3>point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

1701
01:23:57.161 --> 01:23:59.210
<v Speaker 3>nine percent of the people don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>soft is an acronym.</v>

1702
01:23:59.211 --> 01:24:04.211
<v Speaker 3>It stands for special operations forces </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's kind of an umbrella acronym </v>

1703
01:24:04.211 --> 01:24:07.510
<v Speaker 3>for um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know rangers,</v>

1704
01:24:07.511 --> 01:24:09.340
<v Speaker 3>special forces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seals,</v>

1705
01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:11.290
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1706
01:24:11.570 --> 01:24:16.060
<v Speaker 3>and each one of those has their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms.</v>

1707
01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:20.170
<v Speaker 3>Like sf is special for a lot of times </v>
<v Speaker 3>people will come.</v>

1708
01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:23.980
<v Speaker 3>The media is terrible for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll say special forces and they mean</v>

1709
01:24:23.981 --> 01:24:28.981
<v Speaker 3>special operations forces like special </v>
<v Speaker 3>operations forces can be a seal team.</v>

1710
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:34.830
<v Speaker 3>Special forces is an army specific unit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually a branch service.</v>

1711
01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:40.120
<v Speaker 3>But what I was getting back to as I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking,</v>

1712
01:24:40.210 --> 01:24:45.210
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm fortunate to know some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys and they were all kind of </v>

1713
01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:46.090
<v Speaker 3>laughing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1714
01:24:46.091 --> 01:24:51.091

<v Speaker 3>the lapd would be fucked because the </v>

1715
01:24:51.761 --> 01:24:53.410
<v Speaker 3>shit that he did do was bad.</v>

1716
01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:59.010
<v Speaker 3>But the way he got caught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thIngs he was doing is not the shit </v>

1717
01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:00.010

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1718
01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:03.880
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he could have done a lot more damage</v>

1719
01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:07.480
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at the dc snipers.</v>

1720
01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.210
<v Speaker 3>Remember that case malveaux,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>two guys in one rifle and you know,</v>

1723
01:25:21.670 --> 01:25:23.070
<v Speaker 3>if this guy was literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1724
01:25:23.071 --> 01:25:28.071
<v Speaker 3>if he was the john rambo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the media was trying to play him up as </v>

1725
01:25:28.071 --> 01:25:28.071
<v Speaker 3>we've been a hell a lot higher body </v>
<v Speaker 3>count.</v>

1726
01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:32.510
<v Speaker 3>He was just just a fucking whack job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a wack job to decide to go to the</v>

1727
01:25:32.511 --> 01:25:37.511
<v Speaker 3>mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck ever gets out of the </v>

1728
01:25:37.511 --> 01:25:39.641
<v Speaker 3>mountains?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoever goes to the mountains trying to </v>

1729
01:25:39.641 --> 01:25:39.641
<v Speaker 3>flee from the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the worst place you can go.</v>

1730
01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:41.090
<v Speaker 3>You want to go to the valley sun?</v>

1731
01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:43.220
<v Speaker 3>You want to go to the place where he can</v>
<v Speaker 3>move around.</v>

1732
01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:48.400
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to go to the one place </v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's a peak and then you can't </v>

1733
01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.010
<v Speaker 3>go any higher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got up there and he fucked his truck</v>

1734
01:25:49.011 --> 01:25:49.730
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1735
01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:53.970
<v Speaker 3>And it was just hadley fuckers truck up </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the axle,</v>

1736
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:56.870
<v Speaker 3>I guess was trying to get somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just read.</v>

1737
01:25:56.871 --> 01:25:59.840
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go any farther than they lit </v>
<v Speaker 3>his truck on fire.</v>

1738
01:25:59.841 --> 01:26:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And left his weapons and shit in,</v>

1739
01:26:03.190 --> 01:26:06.620
<v Speaker 3>in the truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the crazy part though was.</v>

1740
01:26:06.710 --> 01:26:09.020
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep it out in a cabin.</v>

1741
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:11.960
<v Speaker 3>That was like literally right across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>street from the command post.</v>

1742
01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.730
<v Speaker 3>That's good moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>

1743
01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:15.680
<v Speaker 3>So they were searching all around him</v>

1744
01:26:15.930 --> 01:26:20.930
<v Speaker 1>and he was in the cabin almost right </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the street from the combat area </v>

1745
01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:21.070
<v Speaker 1>is very unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever been up to big bear?</v>

1746
01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:22.630
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very unusual.</v>

1747
01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:25.520
<v Speaker 1>A lot of fighters go up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do their attempts.</v>

1748
01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good for conditioning,</v>

1749
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's a strange place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>

1750
01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Nice folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's weird.</v>

1751
01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:35.210
<v Speaker 3>That whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going back to kind of what I was talking</v>

1752
01:26:35.211 --> 01:26:40.211
<v Speaker 3>about with my idea of the government not</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a responsibility to protect the </v>

1753
01:26:41.061 --> 01:26:43.730
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the boston bombing,</v>

1754
01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:47.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these two guys with the boston bombing,</v>

1755
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:51.410
<v Speaker 3>they shut down a whole fucking major us </v>
<v Speaker 3>city.</v>

1756
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:55.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean they were canceling like major </v>
<v Speaker 3>sports games and shit that night.</v>

1757
01:26:56.180 --> 01:27:01.180
<v Speaker 3>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of having this mentality of </v>

1758
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:05.980
<v Speaker 3>everybody go inside shelter in place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1759
01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:11.020
<v Speaker 3>cower and then we're going to send in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking cops in their armored </v>

1760
01:27:11.031 --> 01:27:14.510
<v Speaker 3>personnel carriers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean it looked like Iraq.</v>

1761
01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:18.530
<v Speaker 3>If you look at some of the photos that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were taken during that time period,</v>

1762
01:27:19.190 --> 01:27:24.190
<v Speaker 3>it looks like Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these guys are wearing fucking </v>

1763
01:27:24.190 --> 01:27:26.590
<v Speaker 3>body armor and multicam and enforce on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the streets of a us city and they're </v>

1764
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:31.490
<v Speaker 3>looking for two assholes with a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure cooker bomb.</v>

1765
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:34.310
<v Speaker 3>And they shut down the whole city and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were telling people,</v>

1766
01:27:34.311 --> 01:27:36.680
<v Speaker 3>don't come out of your house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be scared,</v>

1767
01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:38.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

1768
01:27:38.181 --> 01:27:39.800
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it be better to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1769
01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:43.160
<v Speaker 3>if you see this fucking asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>call us.</v>

1770
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you call us means shoot him.</v>

1771
01:27:46.170 --> 01:27:49.310
<v Speaker 1>And I thought it was him officer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>

1772
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:54.270
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to get better that than </v>
<v Speaker 1>than coward unless it's your kid.</v>

1773
01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better that I don't know about better </v>

1774
01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:02.280
<v Speaker 1>that I agree with you to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>extent and I agree with you with your </v>

1775
01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:06.001
<v Speaker 1>ability to be protected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think that it can't go the </v>

1776
01:28:06.001 --> 01:28:06.060
<v Speaker 1>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly can.</v>

1777
01:28:06.450 --> 01:28:11.450
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your kid happens to be brown and it </v>

1778
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:13.821
<v Speaker 1>looked like that dude in a hoodie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's out walking when they told </v>

1779
01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:13.821
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be inside and be scared.</v>

1780
01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:18.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if everything that we've said from </v>

1781
01:28:18.650 --> 01:28:18.650
<v Speaker 1>the beginning to the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1782
01:28:18.650 --> 01:28:21.690
<v Speaker 1>There's no gray area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no black and white and any of </v>

1783
01:28:21.690 --> 01:28:23.700
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is human behavior.</v>

1784
01:28:23.730 --> 01:28:28.730
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it boils down to is it's not </v>

1785
01:28:28.730 --> 01:28:28.950
<v Speaker 1>weapons and tools and equipments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human behavior,</v>

1786
01:28:28.951 --> 01:28:30.570
<v Speaker 1>because every fucking hardware store has</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ax.</v>

1787
01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many excavators you hear about every</v>

1788
01:28:32.430 --> 01:28:34.740
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can fuck you up with an ax.</v>

1789
01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:40.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy could walk into a grocery store and </v>

1790
01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:40.100
<v Speaker 1>how many people could have killed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ax?</v>

1791
01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:41.690
<v Speaker 1>Free stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably quite a few did,</v>

1792
01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:45.620
<v Speaker 1>and I wrote this on twitter and I'll say</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>

1793
01:28:45.690 --> 01:28:48.660
<v Speaker 1>your quote was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a mental health problem.</v>

1794
01:28:49.330 --> 01:28:51.060
<v Speaker 1>This guys is a gun problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1795
01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:56.320
<v Speaker 1>and a security problem disguised as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny problem or a tyranny problem </v>

1796
01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:58.110
<v Speaker 1>disguised as a security problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up my own quote.</v>

1797
01:28:58.260 --> 01:28:59.490
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a great quote.</v>

1798
01:28:59.491 --> 01:29:01.170
<v Speaker 1>I remember when you wrote that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1799
01:29:01.171 --> 01:29:02.580
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mental health problem.</v>

1800
01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:05.280
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I have guns in,</v>

1801
01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:10.340
<v Speaker 1>almost all of my friends have guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the idea that it's a </v>

1802
01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:12.270
<v Speaker 1>gun issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a gun issue.</v>

1803
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Guns are our tools.</v>

1804
01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:16.650
<v Speaker 1>It's the issue of implementing those </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools in a horrible,</v>

1805
01:29:16.651 --> 01:29:21.651
<v Speaker 1>horrific way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing you can do with your car if </v>

1806
01:29:21.651 --> 01:29:21.651
<v Speaker 1>you're so inclined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can do.</v>

1807
01:29:21.651 --> 01:29:22.650
<v Speaker 1>There was an old man that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1808
01:29:22.710 --> 01:29:23.670
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1809
01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:27.120
<v Speaker 1>freaked out or whatever and just ran </v>
<v Speaker 1>over a bunch of people in santa monica a</v>

1810
01:29:27.121 --> 01:29:28.890
<v Speaker 1>couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was horrific,</v>

1811
01:29:28.891 --> 01:29:31.950
<v Speaker 1>horrific story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but any crazy person could do that too,</v>

1812
01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:33.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like they could shoot you.</v>

1813
01:29:33.811 --> 01:29:36.420
<v Speaker 1>They could kill just as many people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the car much quicker,</v>

1814
01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:39.990
<v Speaker 1>but just plowing into a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to do.</v>

1815
01:29:39.991 --> 01:29:40.950
<v Speaker 1>They could possibly.</v>

1816
01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:46.180
<v Speaker 3>How much damage could you do with a two </v>
<v Speaker 3>liter bottle of gasoline in a movie </v>

1817
01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:46.180
<v Speaker 3>theater?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1818
01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:46.930
<v Speaker 3>jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1819
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yOu know,</v>

1820
01:29:47.651 --> 01:29:51.820
<v Speaker 3>if your intent is to do harm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of weapons and hurt people</v>

1821
01:29:51.850 --> 01:29:56.850
<v Speaker 3>then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my whole thing goes back to the </v>

1822
01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:57.820
<v Speaker 3>mindset that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1823
01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:03.540
<v Speaker 3>if somebody doesn't want to take on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility or,</v>

1824
01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:09.600
<v Speaker 3>and it got nothing to do with guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a mindset of being able to take </v>

1825
01:30:10.421 --> 01:30:13.450
<v Speaker 3>responsibility for your own safety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1826
01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:17.650
<v Speaker 3>And if somebody doesn't want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to delegate that to the state,</v>

1827
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:19.870
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a problem with that,</v>

1828
01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:25.500
<v Speaker 3>but telling me that I have to do that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I have a big giant problem.</v>

1829
01:30:26.810 --> 01:30:29.840
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's the reality of human</v>

1830
01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:34.841
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It requires a certain amount of </v>

1831
01:30:34.841 --> 01:30:35.120
<v Speaker 1>filtering to make sure that shitheads </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's less frequent.</v>

1832
01:30:35.121 --> 01:30:37.370
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get a few that get </v>
<v Speaker 1>through no matter what you do,</v>

1833
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:42.500
<v Speaker 1>but I think that it's not a bad thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be just a little bit diligent about</v>

1834
01:30:42.530 --> 01:30:45.400
<v Speaker 1>who you fucking allowed to have guns and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine because</v>

1835
01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:50.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean if it stopped right now today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you looked at the gun laws on the </v>

1836
01:30:51.231 --> 01:30:52.280
<v Speaker 3>books and that's the other thing,</v>

1837
01:30:52.450 --> 01:30:55.840
<v Speaker 1>you mean if it didn't get any more </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictive and if it stopped.</v>

1838
01:30:56.050 --> 01:30:58.450
<v Speaker 1>all you gun guys are all like </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppression.</v>

1839
01:30:58.451 --> 01:31:00.520
<v Speaker 1>If it stops the day fucking crazy.</v>

1840
01:31:00.610 --> 01:31:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's why is because the anti gunners,</v>

1841
01:31:03.490 --> 01:31:08.490
<v Speaker 3>wherever you want to call them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they always talk about we need to </v>

1842
01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:08.490
<v Speaker 3>compromise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should.</v>

1843
01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:10.990
<v Speaker 3>We should come to a compromise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's the compromise.</v>

1844
01:31:11.230 --> 01:31:13.720
<v Speaker 3>They never give anything up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1845
01:31:13.721 --> 01:31:17.500
<v Speaker 3>it's always one more thing they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking away and this,</v>

1846
01:31:17.710 --> 01:31:22.240
<v Speaker 3>this has been going on since the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thirties and depending on.</v>

1847
01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:25.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean on principle,</v>

1848
01:31:25.630 --> 01:31:27.460
<v Speaker 3>in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of,</v>

1849
01:31:27.461 --> 01:31:30.790
<v Speaker 3>I am called libertarian wherever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hell you want to call it,</v>

1850
01:31:31.210 --> 01:31:36.010
<v Speaker 3>but I am of the mind that pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything goes.</v>

1851
01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:40.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean it should go and if you fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you deserve to get hammered.</v>

1852
01:31:40.690 --> 01:31:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Whether that's drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guns,</v>

1853
01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:43.520
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or</v>

1854
01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:44.720
<v Speaker 1>prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>AnYthing.</v>

1855
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1856
01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Who's to say a woman can't sell her ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>if she wants to.</v>

1857
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean as her body,</v>

1858
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:53.240
<v Speaker 1>especially if she can actually get money</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

1859
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so why can't you give him?</v>

1860
01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:58.280
<v Speaker 1>He can give massages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't that illegal?</v>

1861
01:31:59.110 --> 01:32:00.210
<v Speaker 1>It's just not eligible.</v>

1862
01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:02.890
<v Speaker 2>You need a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massage is a,</v>

1863
01:32:02.891 --> 01:32:04.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as intimate.</v>

1864
01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Oftentimes the socket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your deck or a humming blow job through </v>

1865
01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:12.271
<v Speaker 2>the pants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1866
01:32:14.021 --> 01:32:19.021
<v Speaker 2>I'm a look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and I are on the same page with </v>

1867
01:32:19.021 --> 01:32:22.231
<v Speaker 2>almost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a little more gun that he than </v>

1868
01:32:22.231 --> 01:32:22.231
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's all right.</v>

1869
01:32:22.231 --> 01:32:22.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand it.</v>

1870
01:32:22.241 --> 01:32:23.760
<v Speaker 2>I see where you're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1871
01:32:23.761 --> 01:32:28.761
<v Speaker 2>you're coming from the fact that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked for you and you don't want </v>

1872
01:32:28.761 --> 01:32:28.761
<v Speaker 2>anybody fucking with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>

1873
01:32:28.761 --> 01:32:31.360
<v Speaker 2>that's a rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost an american value.</v>

1874
01:32:31.630 --> 01:32:33.420
<v Speaker 2>The idea of leave me the fuck alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1875
01:32:33.490 --> 01:32:35.290
<v Speaker 2>And that's sort of slipping away</v>

1876
01:32:35.410 --> 01:32:38.130
<v Speaker 3>and I will stand up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will,</v>

1877
01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:40.580
<v Speaker 3>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will be more than happy to,</v>

1878
01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:41.830
<v Speaker 3>to defend the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

1879
01:32:41.850 --> 01:32:43.480
<v Speaker 3>I'll stand up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1880
01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:49.500
<v Speaker 3>I respect and defend the right for </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone to say I don't agree with what </v>

1881
01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:52.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying or that I'm an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>

1882
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:53.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the right to say that.</v>

1883
01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:59.340
<v Speaker 3>But where it's to me that it stops is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that when people force me to delegate my</v>

1884
01:33:03.131 --> 01:33:08.131
<v Speaker 3>ability to protect myself and the state </v>
<v Speaker 3>will not take up that slack.</v>

1885
01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:13.330
<v Speaker 3>They can not only see they can't and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they won't and they shouldn't.</v>

1886
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:16.900
<v Speaker 3>But people saying to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1887
01:33:17.530 --> 01:33:22.530
<v Speaker 3>you don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are going to take away your ability </v>

1888
01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:26.190
<v Speaker 3>to protect yourself in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the name of the off chance that you </v>

1889
01:33:28.811 --> 01:33:32.350
<v Speaker 3>know this may prevent something and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone knows that at won't.</v>

1890
01:33:32.351 --> 01:33:37.351
<v Speaker 3>Because you know why criminals don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>follow the fucking dirt crazy.</v>

1891
01:33:38.561 --> 01:33:38.890
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1892
01:33:39.210 --> 01:33:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laws in themselves in and of themselves </v>

1893
01:33:44.210 --> 01:33:44.210
<v Speaker 2>are very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1894
01:33:44.210 --> 01:33:48.740
<v Speaker 2>in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a helicopter just we've been </v>

1895
01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:49.500
<v Speaker 2>talking to which real shit I told you </v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

1896
01:33:49.530 --> 01:33:52.470

<v Speaker 2>Turn off.</v>

1897

<v Speaker 2>Alex jones in here right now.</v>

1898
01:33:57.331 --> 01:33:59.790
<v Speaker 2>He'd rattle off some statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be amazed.</v>

1899
01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:02.760
<v Speaker 2>You'd be amazed at how many people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>being watched by black helicopters.</v>

1900
01:34:02.761 --> 01:34:06.330
<v Speaker 2>HAve no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1901
01:34:06.331 --> 01:34:06.860
<v Speaker 2>That shit</v>

1902
01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:09.040
<v Speaker 3>when the donor thing was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1903
01:34:09.041 --> 01:34:11.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't follow Alex Jones at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you follow it.</v>

1904
01:34:11.591 --> 01:34:16.591
<v Speaker 3>Then somehow through there and in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way I started following him kind of </v>

1905
01:34:16.591 --> 01:34:20.490
<v Speaker 3>paying attention was because of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking correspondent he had at the </v>

1906

<v Speaker 3>press,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a press conferences that the cops were </v>

1907

1908
01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:26.050
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was fucking hilarious.</v>

1909
01:34:26.051 --> 01:34:30.430
<v Speaker 3>These cops are standing up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could tell the whole fucking city of</v>

<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1911

<v Speaker 3>but the cops are lightened up mexican </v>
<v Speaker 3>women in a white truck for no fucking </v>

1912
01:34:37.981 --> 01:34:39.610
<v Speaker 3>because it might look like what he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>driving.</v>

1913
01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:44.780
<v Speaker 3>That's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean the whole fucking city </v>

1914
01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:44.780

<v Speaker 3>shit and some correspondence from info </v>

<v Speaker 3>most asinine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even remember.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So stupid.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's all this other bullshit and it.</v>

1921
01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Or was it the boston bombings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the boston bombings.</v>

1922
01:35:03.651 --> 01:35:08.651
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't dorner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was boston bombing was boston </v>

1923
01:35:08.651 --> 01:35:08.651
<v Speaker 1>bombings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

1924
01:35:08.651 --> 01:35:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I got them confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Confused the fuck out of me.</v>

1925
01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.660
<v Speaker 1>It was the boston bombings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a boss.</v>

1926
01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:14.090
<v Speaker 1>But you remember what I'm talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the press conference.</v>

1927
01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:16.120
<v Speaker 1>That guy standing up saying that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>

1928
01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:21.160
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were plants saying that it was a </v>

1929
01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:21.350
<v Speaker 1>the guys in the windbreakers or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1930
01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of weirdness when it </v>

1931
01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:26.560
<v Speaker 1>came to those boston bombings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was very weird.</v>

1932
01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:31.421
<v Speaker 1>There were so many people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>crying out that it was a false flag and </v>

1933
01:35:31.421 --> 01:35:35.441
<v Speaker 1>there was so many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much disinformation to what is </v>

1934
01:35:35.441 --> 01:35:35.441
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what not.</v>

1935
01:35:35.441 --> 01:35:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a conspiracy guy either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was just aware of how much of it </v>

1936
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.621
<v Speaker 1>was being perpetrated online and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people were getting the timeline </v>

1937
01:35:44.621 --> 01:35:48.101
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they show him these guys who were </v>

1938
01:35:48.101 --> 01:35:49.661
<v Speaker 1>responding and saying that these guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>were waiting before it ever happened </v>

1939
01:35:49.661 --> 01:35:49.661
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1940
01:35:49.661 --> 01:35:54.490
<v Speaker 1>They already knew about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's so much incorrect </v>

1941
01:35:54.490 --> 01:35:54.490
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1942
01:35:54.490 --> 01:35:56.390
<v Speaker 1>it's weird when that kind of shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens and you know,</v>

1943
01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:59.600
<v Speaker 1>that's somethinG that I really learned a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot about when I did this.</v>

1944
01:35:59.601 --> 01:36:02.290
<v Speaker 1>A scifi show that joe rogan questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's right.</v>

1945
01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1946
01:36:02.681 --> 01:36:05.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot about the mind of people</v>

1947
01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:09.380
<v Speaker 1>who just automatically think that things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not on the up and up.</v>

1948
01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the real issue is that sometimes </v>

1949
01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:15.350
<v Speaker 1>things aren't on the up and up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact,</v>

1950
01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:18.140
<v Speaker 1>the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think more often than not,</v>

1951
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:23.590
<v Speaker 1>people look for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much it's on the up and up </v>

1952
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:26.201
<v Speaker 1>because there's a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on the up and up because people </v>

1953
01:36:26.201 --> 01:36:26.810
<v Speaker 1>don't know what the fuck's going on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they make shit up to fill the space.</v>

1954
01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.210
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely some of that,</v>

1955
01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:34.660
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also real instances </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout history were there's been </v>

1956
01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:35.040
<v Speaker 1>perpetrated.</v>

1957
01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:38.120
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a real problem because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to figure out what's what.</v>

1958
01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:43.190
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people that get </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in these sorts of endeavors.</v>

1959
01:36:43.191 --> 01:36:44.810
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what's real and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's not.</v>

1960
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:48.380
<v Speaker 1>That will have what I call a soft </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect.</v>

1961
01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the ability,</v>

1962
01:36:50.541 --> 01:36:55.541
<v Speaker 1>but by soft I don't mean they're stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean if someone can like fairly </v>

1963
01:36:55.541 --> 01:36:59.150
<v Speaker 1>easily shove a new idea and them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>guide them down the path,</v>

1964
01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:01.940
<v Speaker 1>they want to go shove a hand up their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass and have,</v>

1965
01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:06.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confused them to the point where they </v>

1966
01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:06.980
<v Speaker 1>believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>

1967
01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:11.350
<v Speaker 1>they have a need in them to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastical shit that no one else has </v>

1968
01:37:11.571 --> 01:37:13.190
<v Speaker 1>discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird,</v>

1969
01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:18.220
<v Speaker 1>almost like a desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like the same thing that </v>

1970
01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:21.730
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a bygone thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like left in our dna from when we had to</v>

1971
01:37:21.921 --> 01:37:24.110
<v Speaker 1>discover a new place that had like </v>
<v Speaker 1>better food.</v>

1972
01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:28.460
<v Speaker 1>We found a new hunting trail to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>these new uncovered things.</v>

1973
01:37:28.461 --> 01:37:31.610
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like an imperative and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>the human psyche,</v>

1974
01:37:31.730 --> 01:37:36.350
<v Speaker 1>so people look for fucking stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look for the to be the one guy,</v>

1975
01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:38.180
<v Speaker 1>the trail blazer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that breaker,</v>

1976
01:37:38.290 --> 01:37:40.850
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't mean that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspire,</v>

1977
01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:44.300
<v Speaker 1>but it also means that that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that too.</v>

1978
01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to be aware of that too because </v>

1979
01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:50.510
<v Speaker 1>if you're not aware of that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you deny that to you really do a huge</v>

1980
01:37:50.511 --> 01:37:55.511
<v Speaker 1>disservice to the actual information </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're capable of pulling out when </v>

1981
01:37:55.511 --> 01:37:55.540
<v Speaker 1>you look at things subjectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1982
01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 1>But there's</v>

1983
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:59.400
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get involved in this 10,</v>

1984
01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:02.070
<v Speaker 2>11,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>step game.</v>

1985
01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:05.550
<v Speaker 2>They want to go three or four steps in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and be rigid with their information.</v>

1986
01:38:05.551 --> 01:38:10.551
<v Speaker 2>They Want to stop right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is clearly a conspiracy that guys </v>

1987
01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:12.030
<v Speaker 2>were in the wrong backpack towards his </v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

1988
01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:14.490
<v Speaker 2>This photo shows us towards right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1989
01:38:14.491 --> 01:38:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've realized that that's an actual,</v>

1990
01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:22.580
<v Speaker 2>it's like a psychological groove.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like these people establish it in </v>

1991
01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:26.481
<v Speaker 2>their minds that everything is </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's a conspiracy and it's not </v>

1992
01:38:26.481 --> 01:38:28.590
<v Speaker 2>to say that some things aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many things are,</v>

1993
01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:33.770
<v Speaker 2>so they have some confirmation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get some confirmation out of </v>

1994
01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:33.770
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gulf of tonkin,</v>

1995
01:38:33.810 --> 01:38:36.060
<v Speaker 2>all these different incidents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instances,</v>

1996
01:38:36.061 --> 01:38:36.270
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1997
01:38:36.271 --> 01:38:38.900
<v Speaker 2>the bush cheney idea of before they left</v>
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

1998
01:38:38.901 --> 01:38:43.100
<v Speaker 2>So a false flag about Iran was being </v>
<v Speaker 2>bandied about the,</v>

1999
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:48.250
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the northwoods document where they </v>

2000
01:38:48.250 --> 01:38:50.450
<v Speaker 2>wanted to blow up the fucking drone </v>
<v Speaker 2>airliner and blame it on Cuba and start </v>

2001
01:38:50.450 --> 01:38:50.450
<v Speaker 2>war with Cuba.</v>

2002
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:55.550
<v Speaker 2>All that shit's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the problem is it gets real cloudy </v>

2003
01:38:55.550 --> 01:39:00.081
<v Speaker 2>out there if you're not thinking good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you got any sort of an instance </v>

2004
01:39:00.081 --> 01:39:04.040
<v Speaker 2>that happens in the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's that bombing or this </v>

2005
01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:05.130
<v Speaker 2>bombing or this attack or that attack or</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2006
01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:10.580
<v Speaker 2>there's always going to be a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>horseshit flying around because anyone </v>

2007
01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:12.630
<v Speaker 2>can contribute to the soup of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

2008
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:15.240
<v Speaker 2>anybody could throw some dickhead comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>along and goes,</v>

2009
01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:20.480
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nunes and fucking a giant bucket of </v>

2010
01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:20.540
<v Speaker 2>onions and your soup and your like </v>
<v Speaker 2>dickhead.</v>

2011
01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:25.580
<v Speaker 2>There was plenty of onions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's fucking onion soup with a </v>

2012
01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:25.870
<v Speaker 2>little bit of chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

2013
01:39:25.890 --> 01:39:30.890
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the real issue with the </v>

2014
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:32.960
<v Speaker 2>information that we received today is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a gigantic soup of people </v>

2015
01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:37.230
<v Speaker 2>and the amount of actual real </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists,</v>

2016
01:39:37.530 --> 01:39:42.530
<v Speaker 2>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the original real journalists have been </v>

2017
01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:42.530
<v Speaker 2>replaced by these corporate puppets.</v>

2018
01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:47.510
<v Speaker 2>And then there's real quote unquote </v>
<v Speaker 2>print journalists who are terrified of </v>

2019
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.670
<v Speaker 2>the new media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2020
01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:50.370
<v Speaker 2>And they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll do diffuse vice.com</v>

2021
01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:51.630
<v Speaker 2>or have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2022
01:39:51.631 --> 01:39:52.260
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

2023
01:39:52.261 --> 01:39:54.960
<v Speaker 2>they'll try to take down all the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>media and,</v>

2024
01:39:54.961 --> 01:39:59.961
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make it seem as if these people are </v>

2025
01:39:59.961 --> 01:40:04.280
<v Speaker 2>cretins and these people don't deserve </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be representative of the news and the</v>

2026
01:40:04.831 --> 01:40:08.250
<v Speaker 2>old gray lady is the way to go the New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York times as the gold standard,</v>

2027
01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.720
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the gold standard there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reality has been deposed false shit.</v>

2028
01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:15.060
<v Speaker 2>They get caught all the time and by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

2029
01:40:15.061 --> 01:40:16.530
<v Speaker 2>you're just human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2030
01:40:16.531 --> 01:40:18.690
<v Speaker 2>There is no New York times anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about this?</v>

2031
01:40:18.691 --> 01:40:22.260
<v Speaker 2>How about you or not important about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking information is important and the</v>

2032
01:40:22.261 --> 01:40:25.110
<v Speaker 2>vehicle for the for distributing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>information they want.</v>

2033
01:40:25.111 --> 01:40:28.860
<v Speaker 2>So many accolades is a current.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any vehicle that wants so much,</v>

2034
01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:31.080
<v Speaker 2>so much love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much money.</v>

2035
01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Giant corporation backed up behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>delivering information.</v>

2036
01:40:35.610 --> 01:40:40.610
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nonsense for you to have an ego </v>

2037
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:42.660
<v Speaker 2>about past delivering of information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you should have done because</v>

2038
01:40:42.661 --> 01:40:45.600
<v Speaker 2>that's your fucking job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your job is to deliver information.</v>

2039
01:40:45.690 --> 01:40:49.890
<v Speaker 2>You're a goddamn newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you get all uppity and uptight and</v>

2040
01:40:49.891 --> 01:40:54.891
<v Speaker 2>be afraid of the internet when your </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole fucking thing has been on </v>

2041
01:40:54.891 --> 01:40:56.170
<v Speaker 2>reporting shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually happens.</v>

2042
01:40:56.171 --> 01:40:56.710
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2043
01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.240
<v Speaker 3>It's also about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goes back to the same thing.</v>

2044
01:40:59.270 --> 01:41:00.300
<v Speaker 3>Control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2045
01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:05.380
<v Speaker 3>because if some asshole on the internet </v>
<v Speaker 3>can get on and build a following and and</v>

2046
01:41:06.290 --> 01:41:08.660
<v Speaker 3>gain confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2047
01:41:08.661 --> 01:41:10.940
<v Speaker 3>There is no fucking editor sitting over </v>
<v Speaker 3>him saying,</v>

2048
01:41:10.941 --> 01:41:15.941
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might not want to say that because </v>

2049
01:41:15.941 --> 01:41:15.941
<v Speaker 3>this might piss off my buddy who owns </v>
<v Speaker 3>this company.</v>

2050
01:41:15.941 --> 01:41:20.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not to slight the New York </v>

2051
01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:20.660
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wall street journal,</v>

2052
01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:25.131
<v Speaker 2>the boston globe or any of the old </v>
<v Speaker 2>newspapers in any way and not to </v>

2053
01:41:25.131 --> 01:41:27.510
<v Speaker 2>diminish their accomplishments in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end to end to diminish the.</v>

2054
01:41:27.511 --> 01:41:29.070
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the importance of them.</v>

2055
01:41:29.250 --> 01:41:34.250
<v Speaker 2>I at least I've read the boston globe </v>
<v Speaker 2>every fucking day when I was a kid </v>

2056
01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:37.410
<v Speaker 2>because I delivered it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I delivered it from age shit.</v>

2057
01:41:37.411 --> 01:41:42.411
<v Speaker 2>I started like age 17 to 22.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I delivered the boston globe and at </v>

2058
01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:44.850
<v Speaker 2>occasionally the herald.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read a newspaper every day.</v>

2059
01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:46.920
<v Speaker 2>Newspapers are fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were really,</v>

2060
01:41:46.921 --> 01:41:51.921
<v Speaker 2>really important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you did a job just like feeding </v>

2061
01:41:51.921 --> 01:41:55.230
<v Speaker 2>people was really fucking important back</v>
<v Speaker 2>then to everybody who fed people.</v>

2062
01:41:55.380 --> 01:42:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Those people deserve metals as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the feeding people and providing </v>

2063
01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:01.560
<v Speaker 2>information or actually equally </v>
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>

2064
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:06.830
<v Speaker 2>but the people who fed people didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>treated like kings and queens and </v>

2065
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:10.341
<v Speaker 2>getting didn't get to fucking throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>their arms in the air and and rant and </v>

2066
01:42:10.341 --> 01:42:12.300
<v Speaker 2>rave when a new method of distributing </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition was introduced.</v>

2067
01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:14.280
<v Speaker 3>But it goes back to to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2068
01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:19.820
<v Speaker 3>the people who did distribute that </v>
<v Speaker 3>information were courted by those in </v>

2069
01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:20.520
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2070
01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:22.890
<v Speaker 3>It goes back all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It always has.</v>

2071
01:42:23.010 --> 01:42:24.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as there's been a written word,</v>

2072
01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:30.380
<v Speaker 3>but it goes and that's one thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think now it still fucked up with the </v>

2073
01:42:32.491 --> 01:42:35.520
<v Speaker 3>new medias because how do you control </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything?</v>

2074
01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:37.880
<v Speaker 3>We can't control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything can't control.</v>

2075
01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:39.450
<v Speaker 3>What you can do is marginalize it.</v>

2076
01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:41.460
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be able to control </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2077
01:42:41.461 --> 01:42:46.461
<v Speaker 2>People have to realize that enough is </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough and if you need more money than </v>

2078
01:42:46.461 --> 01:42:47.850
<v Speaker 2>what you're making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most likely you don't deserve it.</v>

2079
01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:51.050
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the reality of the situation.</v>

2080
01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:54.210
<v Speaker 2>If you need more money than than you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>currently making,</v>

2081
01:42:54.211 --> 01:42:56.820
<v Speaker 2>most likely you don't deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's possible that you do,</v>

2082
01:42:56.821 --> 01:43:01.821
<v Speaker 2>and don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I mean by that is that there's a </v>

2083
01:43:01.821 --> 01:43:05.121
<v Speaker 2>lot of people out there that want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to figure out how to profit </v>

2084
01:43:05.251 --> 01:43:10.251
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to figure out how to make </v>

2085
01:43:10.251 --> 01:43:10.251
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to figure out how to.</v>

2086
01:43:10.251 --> 01:43:11.580
<v Speaker 2>But if you're really doing what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to do,</v>

2087
01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:14.550
<v Speaker 2>I firmly believe that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2088
01:43:14.910 --> 01:43:16.920
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's rivers,</v>

2089
01:43:16.921 --> 01:43:21.921
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to cross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's mountains you're going to have </v>

2090
01:43:21.921 --> 01:43:21.921
<v Speaker 2>to climb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to figure out a way</v>

2091
01:43:21.921 --> 01:43:26.421
<v Speaker 2>around it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you might not be in a good place </v>

2092
01:43:26.421 --> 01:43:26.610
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're a person and you're smart,</v>

2093
01:43:27.150 --> 01:43:31.830
<v Speaker 2>there's ways to navigate yourself around</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost every situation.</v>

2094
01:43:32.250 --> 01:43:34.110
<v Speaker 2>As long as you getting nutrition and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're alive.</v>

2095
01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:39.960
<v Speaker 2>If you're getting the nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're alive and you've got an ability </v>

2096
01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:40.410
<v Speaker 2>to think for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be in a terrible situation.</v>

2097
01:43:40.411 --> 01:43:45.411
<v Speaker 2>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there may very well be a way out of </v>

2098
01:43:45.411 --> 01:43:46.440
<v Speaker 2>that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I took 10 guys,</v>

2099
01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only four would be able to figure the </v>

2100
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.171
<v Speaker 2>way out of that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that situation is </v>

2101
01:43:54.171 --> 01:43:57.100
<v Speaker 2>unresolvable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that you got to fucking figure </v>

2102
01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:57.100
<v Speaker 2>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitch,</v>

2103
01:43:57.100 --> 01:44:01.180
<v Speaker 2>you got delta really shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hand a cards and that happens to people </v>

2104
01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 2>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is gross tendency for people to</v>

2105
01:44:02.181 --> 01:44:03.450
<v Speaker 2>just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh good,</v>

2106
01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:06.890
<v Speaker 2>shoot here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new cards and you didn't.</v>

2107
01:44:06.891 --> 01:44:10.220
<v Speaker 2>So you don't understand where I come </v>
<v Speaker 2>from and you have male privilege.</v>

2108
01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:15.420
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that is 100 percent the case in </v>

2109
01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:19.531
<v Speaker 3>the United States at this point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at people that come here and</v>

2110
01:44:20.531 --> 01:44:25.531
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about coming on this </v>

2111
01:44:25.531 --> 01:44:26.170
<v Speaker 3>podcast and I was thinking about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other day and you know,</v>

2112
01:44:27.790 --> 01:44:32.790
<v Speaker 3>I drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing about I live in vegas </v>

2113
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:35.311
<v Speaker 3>in the dichotomy of vegas has always </v>
<v Speaker 3>really struck me as something that's </v>

2114
01:44:35.311 --> 01:44:39.460
<v Speaker 3>kind of fucked up and that you can go </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the cosmopolitan hotel with people </v>

2115
01:44:39.911 --> 01:44:43.810
<v Speaker 3>rolling up $150,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>cars and the most beautiful women in the</v>

2116
01:44:43.811 --> 01:44:48.280
<v Speaker 3>world with millions of dollars that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can spend to drive 10 minutes.</v>

2117
01:44:48.281 --> 01:44:53.281
<v Speaker 3>And there was a home depot with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mexican standing outside of it that is </v>

2118
01:44:53.281 --> 01:44:56.680
<v Speaker 3>willing to work at whatever job you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to give him for $10 a day and busted his</v>

2119
01:44:56.681 --> 01:45:00.370
<v Speaker 3>ass and or guatemalan or I don't know if</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a proper term,</v>

2120
01:45:00.371 --> 01:45:01.270
<v Speaker 3>but you know.</v>

2121
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:04.540
<v Speaker 3>And then we've got a guy who's come here</v>
<v Speaker 3>and willing to do nothing,</v>

2122
01:45:04.810 --> 01:45:07.780
<v Speaker 3>and then you got people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly able to work,</v>

2123
01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:13.470
<v Speaker 3>but they've been told,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not even a lot of people's </v>

2124
01:45:13.470 --> 01:45:14.320
<v Speaker 3>fault because from the time they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>raised up,</v>

2125
01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:16.840
<v Speaker 3>it's not your fault that you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

2126
01:45:17.690 --> 01:45:20.830
<v Speaker 3>It's you've been fucked over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know it.</v>

2127
01:45:20.831 --> 01:45:21.920
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2128
01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:24.850
<v Speaker 3>society has kept you down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've kept you on educated.</v>

2129
01:45:25.150 --> 01:45:27.160
<v Speaker 3>It's not your fault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have anything,</v>

2130
01:45:27.580 --> 01:45:30.970
<v Speaker 3>but yet you get people in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the beauties to me and</v>

2131
01:45:30.971 --> 01:45:33.190
<v Speaker 3>it's cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really is.</v>

2132
01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:35.830
<v Speaker 3>But to me that's one of the beauties of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this country.</v>

2133
01:45:35.831 --> 01:45:38.860
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This country to me is built on.</v>

2134
01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:43.300
<v Speaker 3>And if you ask almost anyone from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has come here from somewhere else,</v>

2135
01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:49.020
<v Speaker 3>they will tell you that that's why they </v>
<v Speaker 3>came here is because this is one of the </v>

2136
01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:53.290
<v Speaker 3>few places in the world where you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>take yourself from nothing to something.</v>

2137
01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:58.250
<v Speaker 3>If you're willing to work and you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to bust your ass and,</v>

2138
01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:02.650
<v Speaker 3>and understand and adapt to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstances you were in.</v>

2139
01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:08.220
<v Speaker 3>There really is opportunity here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when I hear people talk about </v>

2140
01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:08.950
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that,</v>

2141
01:46:08.951 --> 01:46:10.330
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got fucked over,</v>

2142
01:46:10.630 --> 01:46:11.680
<v Speaker 3>I got no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2143
01:46:11.681 --> 01:46:14.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we both were someone to say,</v>

2144
01:46:14.351 --> 01:46:15.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

2145
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Nobody would consider me successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2146
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:22.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm successful in the fact that I get to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do what I like to do and I really enjoy </v>

2147
01:46:23.171 --> 01:46:24.880
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to me,</v>

2148
01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:27.790
<v Speaker 3>I make less money now than I did when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked for ford.</v>

2149
01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:28.780
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2150

<v Speaker 3>fuck I want to do today.</v>

01:47:01.771 --> 01:47:03.900
<v Speaker 2>you can do now because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2164
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:07.080
<v Speaker 2>because this is really a very popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing in the world.</v>

2165
01:47:07.081 --> 01:47:12.081
<v Speaker 2>The pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the most important thing in </v>

2166
01:47:12.081 --> 01:47:12.081
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pool right now,</v>

2167
01:47:12.081 --> 01:47:14.040
<v Speaker 2>my opinion is no pool on tv these days </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it wasn't for the strong presence</v>

2168
01:47:14.041 --> 01:47:16.140
<v Speaker 2>of the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's ace billiards.com</v>

2169
01:47:16.141 --> 01:47:19.020
<v Speaker 2>or whether it's your website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not much keeping.</v>

2170
01:47:19.021 --> 01:47:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Like the community of pool players </v>
<v Speaker 2>together pulls a weird thing.</v>

2171
01:47:22.471 --> 01:47:27.471
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't understand how fun it is </v>

2172
01:47:27.471 --> 01:47:28.530
<v Speaker 2>for the people who play it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For a guy like you were.</v>

2173
01:47:28.531 --> 01:47:30.270
<v Speaker 2>I was one of those things</v>

2174
01:47:30.930 --> 01:47:32.970
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not a pool guy,</v>

2175
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:38.030
<v Speaker 3>like the stuff we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably wouldn't interest you </v>

2176
01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:39.660
<v Speaker 3>because our shit is designed for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fan.</v>

2177
01:47:39.690 --> 01:47:41.400
<v Speaker 3>The guy who understands the game and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2178
01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:43.440
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>

2179
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:47.320
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paul is the world of pool.</v>

2180
01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:49.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean it goes back to the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hustler,</v>

2181
01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:51.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you got the color of money,</v>

2182
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:55.970
<v Speaker 3>but it's a subculture that is almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>uniquely american.</v>

2183
01:47:56.540 --> 01:48:01.540
<v Speaker 3>It really is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's been transplanted to other </v>

2184
01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:01.540
<v Speaker 3>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2185
01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:06.370
<v Speaker 3>but the american and my website's name </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the action report and it started out </v>

2186
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:12.430
<v Speaker 3>as an idea to show the gambling side of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the game because our idea was I'd been </v>

2187
01:48:13.971 --> 01:48:17.540
<v Speaker 3>around pulling my whole life and I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>always loved the gambling side of it and</v>

2188
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:20.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pool for the most part on espn.</v>

2189
01:48:20.481 --> 01:48:25.481
<v Speaker 3>they dress a guys up like golfers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they send them out there and one guy </v>

2190
01:48:25.481 --> 01:48:29.231
<v Speaker 3>breaks and runs and the other guy breaks</v>
<v Speaker 3>and runs and they all look the same and </v>

2191
01:48:29.231 --> 01:48:30.680
<v Speaker 3>nobody and it just didn't go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2192
01:48:31.490 --> 01:48:32.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

2193
01:48:32.691 --> 01:48:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy the action side of the game and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

2194
01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:40.280
<v Speaker 3>and it wasn't because so much of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bedding or the guys,</v>

2195
01:48:40.281 --> 01:48:41.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking up a game,</v>

2196
01:48:42.590 --> 01:48:47.590
<v Speaker 3>but because to me it comes back to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>quintessential american fucking idea of </v>

2197
01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:55.900
<v Speaker 3>two guys coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting their money up and the way you </v>

2198
01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:58.700
<v Speaker 3>keep track is by who gets more money at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the end.</v>

2199
01:48:59.390 --> 01:49:00.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2200
01:49:00.230 --> 01:49:01.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you already doesn't count.</v>

2201
01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all just in.</v>

2202
01:49:04.090 --> 01:49:09.090
<v Speaker 1>The beautiful thing about pool is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually the reason why it's </v>

2203
01:49:09.090 --> 01:49:13.631
<v Speaker 1>called pool in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like folks don't realize it was called </v>

2204
01:49:13.631 --> 01:49:15.710
<v Speaker 1>pocket billiards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pooling their money together.</v>

2205
01:49:15.711 --> 01:49:19.080
<v Speaker 1>The bet on the game was the whole reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it was like the,</v>

2206
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:21.820
<v Speaker 1>the chosen sport of the forbidden youth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2207
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:25.850
<v Speaker 1>the glorious results of a misspent youth</v>
<v Speaker 1>is all about how good you are at playing</v>

2208
01:49:25.851 --> 01:49:28.550
<v Speaker 1>pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's those areas during the,</v>

2209
01:49:28.551 --> 01:49:29.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>max amberly,</v>

2210
01:49:29.630 --> 01:49:30.950
<v Speaker 1>kind of an expert on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2211
01:49:30.951 --> 01:49:35.951
<v Speaker 1>the bachelor lifestyle and max everly </v>
<v Speaker 1>talks with great fondness of the </v>

2212
01:49:36.801 --> 01:49:40.850
<v Speaker 1>bachelor lifestyle of the early 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds in New York city and all across</v>

2213
01:49:40.851 --> 01:49:45.851
<v Speaker 1>the country really were men who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>bachelors would go to pool halls and </v>

2214
01:49:45.851 --> 01:49:45.980
<v Speaker 1>that's where they would live and hang </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2215
01:49:45.981 --> 01:49:50.981
<v Speaker 1>And those are the guys that did want </v>
<v Speaker 1>settle down and have families and just </v>

2216
01:49:50.981 --> 01:49:51.040
<v Speaker 1>join the american grind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2217
01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:52.290
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

2218
01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:55.530
<v Speaker 3>pool has always been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dying,</v>

2219
01:49:55.531 --> 01:49:58.740
<v Speaker 3>now it's dead pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for a lot of years,</v>

2220
01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:00.870
<v Speaker 3>even through the war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thirties,</v>

2221
01:50:00.871 --> 01:50:01.950
<v Speaker 3>twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thirties,</v>

2222
01:50:02.010 --> 01:50:03.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after world war one,</v>

2223
01:50:03.450 --> 01:50:05.370
<v Speaker 3>even up and through the great </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression.</v>

2224
01:50:05.970 --> 01:50:10.970
<v Speaker 3>But there was that they called and pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called a road player or roadman.</v>

2225
01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:16.640
<v Speaker 3>And that is a guy who goes from town to </v>
<v Speaker 3>town playing,</v>

2226
01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:19.230
<v Speaker 3>depending on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Personally,</v>

2227
01:50:19.231 --> 01:50:24.231
<v Speaker 3>I hate the term pool hustler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking despise it because to me a </v>

2228
01:50:24.331 --> 01:50:26.640
<v Speaker 3>pool hustler is a thief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a con man.</v>

2229
01:50:27.150 --> 01:50:29.270
<v Speaker 3>He's a guy that goes in and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2230
01:50:29.670 --> 01:50:30.960
<v Speaker 3>tries to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2231
01:50:30.961 --> 01:50:33.450
<v Speaker 3>he lays down and he tries to get some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sucker,</v>

2232
01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:34.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gam.</v>

2233
01:50:34.651 --> 01:50:36.360
<v Speaker 3>That's always an interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2234
01:50:36.361 --> 01:50:38.520
<v Speaker 3>the movie the hustler was pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on that,</v>

2235
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:43.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in pool they call it playing on the </v>

2236
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:45.450
<v Speaker 3>lemon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to me what I like and the way most,</v>

2237
01:50:45.451 --> 01:50:47.520
<v Speaker 3>a lot of successful road guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew,</v>

2238
01:50:48.150 --> 01:50:51.030
<v Speaker 3>they didn't go in and try to play and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say they play bad.</v>

2239
01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:56.420
<v Speaker 3>They will go in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll beat any asshole you got in here </v>

2240
01:50:56.420 --> 01:50:57.540
<v Speaker 3>for whatever you want to bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the truly american idea of it.</v>

2241
01:50:57.780 --> 01:51:02.780
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes back to the gunfighter thing or </v>

2242
01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:02.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:20.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to me that idea and that's kind of </v>

2249
01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:24.681
<v Speaker 3>what are our site and our events and </v>

<v Speaker 1>about the color of money match between </v>

<v Speaker 1>filipino paleo player for a lot of folks</v>

2257
01:51:45.021 --> 01:51:50.021
<v Speaker 1>who don't know anything about pool for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the filipinos in the 19 fifties I guess </v>

2258
01:51:50.151 --> 01:51:52.730
<v Speaker 1>when the United States navy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the navy,</v>

2259
01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:53.990
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big navy base,</v>

2260
01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:59.020
<v Speaker 1>they introduced a pool to the filipinos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just fuck it and ran with that </v>

2261
01:51:59.301 --> 01:52:03.650
<v Speaker 1>shit and now they produce some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very best players in the world.</v>

2262
01:52:03.930 --> 01:52:04.910
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting</v>

2263
01:52:05.230 --> 01:52:10.230
<v Speaker 3>in the Philippines is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's as big a deal is any major </v>

2265
01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:17.770
<v Speaker 3>who's in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best american player at this time.</v>

2266
01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:20.710
<v Speaker 3>He's a friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He plays in a lot of our matches,</v>

2267
01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:26.310
<v Speaker 3>but he was joking that the only place on</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth you can get in the cab and have </v>

2268
01:52:27.041 --> 01:52:29.170
<v Speaker 3>the cab driver knew who he is in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Philippines.</v>

2269
01:52:31.210 --> 01:52:32.770
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

2270
01:52:33.310 --> 01:52:38.310
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about him on the podcast </v>

2271
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.310
<v Speaker 1>several times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Folks who haven't heard about it,</v>

2272
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:39.610
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's deaf and when he plays pool,</v>

2273
01:52:39.611 --> 01:52:42.790
<v Speaker 1>he shuts his hearing aid off and it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes into the zone.</v>

2274
01:52:43.150 --> 01:52:46.220
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also plays killer</v>

2275
01:52:46.230 --> 01:52:51.230
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He plays about as good as anybody who's </v>

2276
01:52:51.230 --> 01:52:51.230
<v Speaker 2>ever played.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2277
01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:54.770
<v Speaker 2>he has his moments where it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>stunning shit.</v>

2278
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:59.910
<v Speaker 2>And he had those moments gambling for </v>
<v Speaker 2>big money on your podcast or your,</v>

2279
01:52:59.911 --> 01:53:03.530
<v Speaker 2>your broadcasts rather when these race </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hundreds when you see him,</v>

2280
01:53:03.531 --> 01:53:08.531
<v Speaker 2>like get loose and just fire on dudes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hit them with you had I really tight</v>

2281
01:53:08.961 --> 01:53:12.230
<v Speaker 2>table for folks that don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A standard table is five inches.</v>

2282
01:53:12.231 --> 01:53:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Like if you buy one right froM the </v>
<v Speaker 2>store,</v>

2283
01:53:14.181 --> 01:53:17.780
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times are about five inches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cut tables about four inches.</v>

2284
01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:20.330
<v Speaker 2>And you got five and four and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four and a half.</v>

2285
01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:21.910
<v Speaker 2>But you guys were for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2286
01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:23.550
<v Speaker 2>for you guys were tight for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2287
01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:27.640
<v Speaker 2>And it was brutality and guys would </v>
<v Speaker 2>panic every time.</v>

2288
01:53:27.641 --> 01:53:32.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean [inaudible] you're playing for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of money and there's not a lot of </v>

2289
01:53:32.641 --> 01:53:32.641
<v Speaker 2>margin of error.</v>

2290
01:53:32.641 --> 01:53:34.550
<v Speaker 2>And you'd go to shoot into that four </v>
<v Speaker 2>inch fucking hold on a diamond table,</v>

2291
01:53:34.551 --> 01:53:38.990
<v Speaker 2>which is really difficult because it has</v>
<v Speaker 2>an extra wide or extra deep shelf.</v>

2292
01:53:38.991 --> 01:53:42.860
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of balls that would fall on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>brunswick don't fall on a diamond.</v>

2293
01:53:43.050 --> 01:53:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This motherfucker,</v>

2294
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:46.640
<v Speaker 2>he's playing like they're swimming </v>
<v Speaker 2>pools.</v>

2295
01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:49.970
<v Speaker 2>He's just slamming balls into the back </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the pocket.</v>

2296
01:53:49.971 --> 01:53:54.971
<v Speaker 2>And it's shocking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just gets in that assassin groove </v>

2297
01:53:54.971 --> 01:53:59.050
<v Speaker 2>where he can't miss and he's running six</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sevens on what I mean by six and </v>

2298
01:53:59.181 --> 01:54:04.181
<v Speaker 2>sevens is six and seven racks in a row </v>
<v Speaker 2>of 10 ball without missing braking and </v>

2299
01:54:04.911 --> 01:54:08.300
<v Speaker 2>running a rack of 10 ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like nine ball.</v>

2300
01:54:08.301 --> 01:54:13.301
<v Speaker 2>You run the balls in the order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's 10 and it's super fucking </v>

2301
01:54:13.301 --> 01:54:14.180
<v Speaker 2>hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this dude is like click off with the</v>

2302
01:54:14.181 --> 01:54:17.090
<v Speaker 2>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just not missing.</v>

2303
01:54:17.091 --> 01:54:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Every ball is so precise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

2304
01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:23.620
<v Speaker 2>he gets to the point where he's got that</v>
<v Speaker 2>cue ball on a string and it's like,</v>

2305
01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:25.360
<v Speaker 2>he's like rolling the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2306
01:54:25.370 --> 01:54:30.370
<v Speaker 2>you've deScribed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's every ball is just </v>

2307
01:54:30.370 --> 01:54:31.940
<v Speaker 2>through the bone rolls through theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a perfect delivery.</v>

2308
01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:34.690
<v Speaker 3>And one of my favorite things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>shane as a player,</v>

2309
01:54:34.890 --> 01:54:36.370
<v Speaker 3>and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a friend of mine.</v>

2310
01:54:36.371 --> 01:54:39.760
<v Speaker 3>I've known him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met him in 2006 december,</v>

2311
01:54:39.761 --> 01:54:43.540
<v Speaker 3>2006 a long before I ever did this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2312
01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:48.550
<v Speaker 3>The actual import tars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it's called t a r a.</v>

2313
01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:51.670
<v Speaker 3>We started in july of 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2314
01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:56.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've known shane and right now the </v>

2315
01:54:56.700 --> 01:54:58.000
<v Speaker 3>kid we're talking about is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

2316
01:54:58.030 --> 01:55:00.370
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a lot of other people's opinion,</v>

2317
01:55:00.371 --> 01:55:05.371
<v Speaker 3>the best american player,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's one of the best in the world by </v>

2318
01:55:05.371 --> 01:55:05.371
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2319
01:55:05.770 --> 01:55:07.660
<v Speaker 3>anybody's measure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2320
01:55:07.730 --> 01:55:10.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2321
01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:15.540
<v Speaker 3>he's still young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he is a guy that he,</v>

2322
01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:18.400
<v Speaker 3>he goes a hundred percent every time he </v>
<v Speaker 3>plays,</v>

2323
01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:23.020
<v Speaker 3>but even if he loses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's able to take that.</v>

2324
01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:25.570
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't fuck him up to the point </v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

2325
01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:28.750
<v Speaker 3>and pull such a mental game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2326
01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:29.650
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>

2327
01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:30.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2328
01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:33.790
<v Speaker 3>it's so crazy how mental have a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

2329
01:55:34.330 --> 01:55:35.110
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2330
01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:38.220
<v Speaker 3>he could take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could take his last taken,</v>

2331
01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:39.990
<v Speaker 3>come back was carried that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2332
01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:42.160
<v Speaker 3>but in a tournament he can take it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>come back and win.</v>

2333
01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:44.370
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2334
01:55:44.371 --> 01:55:46.980
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a subculture that to me,</v>

2335
01:55:47.970 --> 01:55:50.390
<v Speaker 3>there's a great quote in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2336
01:55:50.730 --> 01:55:53.840
<v Speaker 3>the color of money and Paul Paul Newman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if nobody,</v>

2337
01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.770
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>

2338
01:55:56.010 --> 01:56:00.120
<v Speaker 3>chances are maybe a lot of your viewers </v>
<v Speaker 3>or listeners haven't seen that movie,</v>

2339
01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:02.670
<v Speaker 3>but the color of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you haven't seen it,</v>

2340
01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:05.190
<v Speaker 3>check it out to Paul Newman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a young tom cruise.</v>

2341
01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:10.820
<v Speaker 3>But in that paul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a scene where a Paul Newman has </v>

2342
01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:15.630
<v Speaker 3>a quote and these talking to tom </v>
<v Speaker 3>cruise's girlfriend trying to get her to</v>

2343
01:56:15.631 --> 01:56:20.631
<v Speaker 3>convince crews to go out on the road and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says basically,</v>

2344
01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:26.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're the best in the world at </v>

2345
01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:26.960
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what it is,</v>

2346
01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:29.030
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then rich can be arrange.</v>

2347
01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Rich comes pretty eAsy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2348
01:56:32.490 --> 01:56:37.490
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and before that he had mentioned I </v>

2349
01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:39.501
<v Speaker 3>invest in excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to me that's what turns me on about </v>

2350
01:56:39.501 --> 01:56:43.720
<v Speaker 3>anything what I do with pool or any </v>
<v Speaker 3>cues,</v>

2351
01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.750
<v Speaker 3>pool cues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a cute guy too,</v>

2352
01:56:46.170 --> 01:56:48.390
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or anything,</v>

2353
01:56:48.510 --> 01:56:53.510
<v Speaker 3>whatever the hell it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested in the people who do it </v>

2354
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:56.750
<v Speaker 3>the best because to me that excellence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2355
01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:00.430
<v Speaker 3>that's where the genius lies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2356
01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:05.760
<v Speaker 3>because anybody can do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to me it's that ability,</v>

2357
01:57:06.871 --> 01:57:08.760
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that human nature,</v>

2358
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:13.110
<v Speaker 3>that talent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that drive to be excellent at something.</v>

2359
01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:18.440
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me that fascinates me and it's </v>

2360
01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:20.460
<v Speaker 3>different for different people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about like with pool,</v>

2361
01:57:20.461 --> 01:57:25.461
<v Speaker 3>it's such a mental game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I joke a lot and it's only kind of half </v>

2362
01:57:25.461 --> 01:57:28.770
<v Speaker 3>joking that to be really good at pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be about half nuts.</v>

2363
01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:31.570
<v Speaker 3>Just barely half joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2364
01:57:31.650 --> 01:57:32.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2365
01:57:32.991 --> 01:57:37.991
<v Speaker 3>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to give up so much of </v>

2366
01:57:37.991 --> 01:57:37.991
<v Speaker 3>everything else.</v>

2367
01:57:37.991 --> 01:57:39.680
<v Speaker 2>People will never understand that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>

2368
01:57:40.170 --> 01:57:42.660
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I lived in New York,</v>

2369
01:57:42.690 --> 01:57:46.350
<v Speaker 2>I played easily eight hours a day almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

2370
01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:48.510
<v Speaker 2>I constantly played pool and I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>very good,</v>

2371
01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:52.140
<v Speaker 2>but I was obsessed with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you get to a point where you're</v>

2372
01:57:52.141 --> 01:57:54.110
<v Speaker 2>at the level of the high level </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional,</v>

2373

2376
01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:08.300
<v Speaker 2>You have to be in the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're out of the pool hall for a </v>

2377
01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:08.300
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fill out a stroke.</v>

2378
01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:08.670
<v Speaker 2>If you take a day off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They took A day off and they came back </v>

01:58:25.710 --> 01:58:29.010
<v Speaker 3>they really don't play everyday putting </v>
<v Speaker 3>in eight,</v>

2389
01:58:29.011 --> 01:58:31.140
<v Speaker 3>10 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people wouldn't think they would.</v>

2390
01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:32.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they get to a certain level,</v>

2391
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:36.930
<v Speaker 3>they understand It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

2392
01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:40.170
<v Speaker 3>a lot of this because maybe they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to.</v>

2393
01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:45.620
<v Speaker 3>But that's the difference with a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>like shane is he does these.</v>

2394
01:58:46.450 --> 01:58:48.310
<v Speaker 3>And the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flip side of this too though,</v>

2395
01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.680
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've had a couple players,</v>

2396
01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:55.740
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about it and that is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that shane is a guy that is on the </v>

2397
01:58:56.081 --> 01:58:57.820
<v Speaker 3>rise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is his ascendancy.</v>

2398
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.940
<v Speaker 3>He's 28 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>29,</v>

2399
01:59:00.941 --> 01:59:03.130
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not married,</v>

2400
01:59:03.131 --> 01:59:06.520
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have any kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

2401
01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:08.060
<v Speaker 3>this is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

2402
01:59:08.830 --> 01:59:09.780
<v Speaker 3>this is his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2403
01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:11.260
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's stars on the rise.</v>

2404
01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:14.530
<v Speaker 3>So right now this is life man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2405
01:59:14.531 --> 01:59:16.810
<v Speaker 3>this is what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a hundred percent focused.</v>

2406
01:59:17.230 --> 01:59:19.120
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't worry about making this </v>
<v Speaker 3>mortgage payment.</v>

2407
01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:20.700
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't worry about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2408
01:59:20.770 --> 01:59:24.520
<v Speaker 3>this is old lady mad at him because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to go do this or do that,</v>

2409
01:59:25.090 --> 01:59:26.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just,</v>

2410
01:59:27.010 --> 01:59:27.820
<v Speaker 3>that's what he's doing</v>

2411
01:59:28.170 --> 01:59:30.680
<v Speaker 2>and that's what it takes to be really </v>
<v Speaker 2>excellent at something.</v>

2412
01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:31.640
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2413
01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:36.290
<v Speaker 2>and every time in chains case when he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>had some ups and downs,</v>

2414
01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:41.320
<v Speaker 2>the downs all were related to the honey </v>
<v Speaker 2>hole sun all related to that glorious </v>

2415
01:59:43.191 --> 01:59:45.260
<v Speaker 2>thing that we're all searching for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2416
01:59:45.261 --> 01:59:46.730
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting thing.</v>

2417
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2418
01:59:47.661 --> 01:59:48.350
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2419
01:59:48.410 --> 01:59:50.810
<v Speaker 2>the idea of excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and I agree on that,</v>

2420
01:59:50.811 --> 01:59:52.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were both fascinated by that.</v>

2421
01:59:52.551 --> 01:59:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Especially we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we share the interest in queue.</v>

2422
01:59:55.760 --> 02:00:00.760
<v Speaker 2>People don't even know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a whole beautiful art to </v>

2423
02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:00.760
<v Speaker 2>making pool cues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some.</v>

2424
02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:04.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a functional art art form that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

2425
02:00:04.281 --> 02:00:09.281
<v Speaker 2>very rare because it's got to have both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Acu in order to be really revered has to</v>

2426
02:00:10.791 --> 02:00:13.430
<v Speaker 2>have playability and it has to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>design.</v>

2427
02:00:13.670 --> 02:00:16.550
<v Speaker 2>If acu Just has designed people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't give a fuck about it.</v>

2428
02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Like if you get a cue from like </v>
<v Speaker 2>southwest or john showman,</v>

2429
02:00:20.330 --> 02:00:21.130
<v Speaker 2>you get to see john.</v>

2430
02:00:21.130 --> 02:00:24.280
<v Speaker 2>John was a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it doesn't make that many and,</v>

2431
02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:27.510
<v Speaker 2>and the thing about the cues are that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they play a,</v>

2432
02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:32.680
<v Speaker 2>they have a balance and I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a showman and it's like it's different </v>

2433
02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:36.761
<v Speaker 2>than any other steel jointed queue I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever played with and it's because </v>

2434
02:00:36.761 --> 02:00:37.220
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dude just has a way of making shit.</v>

2435
02:00:37.221 --> 02:00:39.770
<v Speaker 2>He knows what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He figured it out.</v>

2436
02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:44.800
<v Speaker 2>He knows how to splice things together </v>
<v Speaker 2>and send them correctly and cure the </v>

2437
02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:45.860
<v Speaker 2>wood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

2438
02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:50.890
<v Speaker 2>it's a really beautiful functional art </v>
<v Speaker 2>form that's slowly being lost,</v>

2439
02:00:51.170 --> 02:00:52.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2440
02:00:52.230 --> 02:00:57.230
<v Speaker 3>you bring up john and he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an example of one of the things,</v>

2441
02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:01.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excellent.</v>

2442
02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Like I was talking about is something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that really excites me anD it interests </v>

2443
02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:08.330
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing is craftsmanship.</v>

2444
02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:10.830
<v Speaker 3>The people that make things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2445
02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:13.640
<v Speaker 3>whether that's knives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guns,</v>

2446
02:01:13.641 --> 02:01:15.690
<v Speaker 3>pool cues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people guys.</v>

2447
02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:16.100
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2448
02:01:16.130 --> 02:01:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2449
02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:21.140
<v Speaker 3>Guys in mostly for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that do it,</v>

2450
02:01:21.650 --> 02:01:24.860
<v Speaker 3>one man shops or one or two man shops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2451
02:01:24.861 --> 02:01:27.890
<v Speaker 3>a guy gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I have a background,</v>

2452
02:01:27.891 --> 02:01:32.891
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a machining background and things like </v>

2453
02:01:32.891 --> 02:01:34.841
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have a basic understanding of what </v>

2454
02:01:34.841 --> 02:01:38.921
<v Speaker 3>it takes to make something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take it from a drawing on a piece of </v>

2455
02:01:38.921 --> 02:01:42.311
<v Speaker 3>paper to a block metal or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a bunch of have been full of parts </v>

2456
02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:48.400
<v Speaker 3>and turn it into something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know how god damn difficult that </v>

2457
02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:50.500
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then to,</v>

2458
02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:55.520
<v Speaker 3>to be able to do that at a very high </v>
<v Speaker 3>level to where you have people wanting </v>

2459
02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:58.700
<v Speaker 3>to pay thousands and thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars for what you do.</v>

2460
02:02:01.190 --> 02:02:04.010
<v Speaker 3>That to me is one of the coolest things </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>

2461
02:02:04.570 --> 02:02:09.570
<v Speaker 3>And I'm john's a friend of mine and I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>been to a shop and he's for people and I</v>

2462
02:02:12.231 --> 02:02:15.290
<v Speaker 3>realized we're talking about something </v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't know about or understand,</v>

2463
02:02:15.710 --> 02:02:20.710
<v Speaker 3>but he makes these cues and a high end </v>
<v Speaker 3>pool cue starts about 2,500</v>

2464
02:02:22.181 --> 02:02:25.580
<v Speaker 3>to $3,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>and can go up to $10,000.</v>

2465
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:28.240
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of these cues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2466
02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:31.760
<v Speaker 3>like many things with high demand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2467
02:02:31.790 --> 02:02:33.920
<v Speaker 3>if you can buy it directly from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>source,</v>

2468
02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:39.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually get it for cheaper than </v>

2469
02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:39.040
<v Speaker 3>what the secondary market is so you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually flip it.</v>

2470
02:02:39.050 --> 02:02:41.720
<v Speaker 3>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's the same way with knives.</v>

2471
02:02:41.890 --> 02:02:46.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my new freak thing is a custom </v>

2472
02:02:46.890 --> 02:02:48.260
<v Speaker 3>foLding knives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

2473
02:02:48.261 --> 02:02:53.261
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>john makes these jews out of a one car </v>

2474
02:02:53.261 --> 02:02:53.920
<v Speaker 3>garage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went and shot a did.</v>

2475
02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you ever see the documentary?</v>

2476
02:02:55.610 --> 02:02:57.680
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really interesting stuff.</v>

2477
02:02:57.830 --> 02:03:02.830
<v Speaker 3>He makes these cues in a one car garage </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if I showed it to you like at a </v>

2478
02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:07.490
<v Speaker 3>accustomed q show that they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do have um,</v>

2479
02:03:07.491 --> 02:03:10.160
<v Speaker 3>things like that or some just weld on </v>
<v Speaker 3>photographs.</v>

2480
02:03:11.090 --> 02:03:16.090
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a work of art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean his stuff is just so well </v>

2481
02:03:16.090 --> 02:03:19.451
<v Speaker 3>executed and you kind of have to ask </v>
<v Speaker 3>them knowledge to know what you're </v>

2482
02:03:19.451 --> 02:03:21.590
<v Speaker 3>looking at because things were even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2483
02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:23.980
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>BuT it's,</v>

2484
02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:25.570
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting thing.</v>

2485
02:03:25.571 --> 02:03:30.571
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to describe it is don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have anything to do with when you </v>

2486
02:03:30.571 --> 02:03:33.080
<v Speaker 3>see where it's made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you just look at this item,</v>

2487
02:03:33.081 --> 02:03:34.130
<v Speaker 3>you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay shit,</v>

2488
02:03:34.131 --> 02:03:36.290
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you.</v>

2489
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:40.080
<v Speaker 3>And then you kind of have to explain to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that it's would you know,</v>

2490
02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:43.220
<v Speaker 3>this is a round piece of wood that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>tapered,</v>

2491
02:03:43.610 --> 02:03:48.470
<v Speaker 3>that's got big ass cuts in it with parts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it pulled out and then other parts of</v>

2492
02:03:48.471 --> 02:03:52.370
<v Speaker 3>it glued back in where you took that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit out of and perfectly.</v>

2493
02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:54.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then little pieces of,</v>

2494
02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:56.090
<v Speaker 3>of wood cut out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't even know what the</v>

2495
02:03:56.091 --> 02:04:00.200
<v Speaker 3>inlay is or understand it for any an </v>
<v Speaker 3>inlay in anything,</v>

2496
02:04:00.201 --> 02:04:03.830
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a pool cue or you see a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it in jewelry boxes.</v>

2497
02:04:04.260 --> 02:04:05.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

2498
02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:08.420
<v Speaker 3>some furniture has a lot of inlay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they'll do,</v>

2499
02:04:08.970 --> 02:04:12.200
<v Speaker 3>say you've got a circle and you've got </v>
<v Speaker 3>made out of ivory,</v>

2500
02:04:12.230 --> 02:04:17.230
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've got a nice wooden table and </v>

2501
02:04:17.230 --> 02:04:17.230
<v Speaker 3>you want to put the circle of ivory in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2502
02:04:17.230 --> 02:04:20.570
<v Speaker 3>What you do is you go in and you mail </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a circle,</v>

2503
02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:23.270
<v Speaker 3>so you cut out the wood and leave a hole</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2504
02:04:23.630 --> 02:04:26.150
<v Speaker 3>Then you take your piece of ivory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you glue it in,</v>

2505
02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:31.100
<v Speaker 3>and then you sand it or millet flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then so now it looks like you've got</v>

2506
02:04:31.101 --> 02:04:32.970
<v Speaker 3>a nice piece of wood with a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ivory there.</v>

2507
02:04:33.700 --> 02:04:36.200
<v Speaker 3>Now if you take that and you multiply </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2508
02:04:36.210 --> 02:04:41.210
<v Speaker 3>I think the queue you've got of john's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw it when he delivered it initially </v>

2509
02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:47.120
<v Speaker 3>at super bowl expo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it's like a hundred and </v>

2510
02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:49.731
<v Speaker 3>some inlays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine doing that hundred times.</v>

2511
02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:55.700
<v Speaker 3>And now here's the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you fuck up on the 99th time,</v>

2512
02:04:56.610 --> 02:04:59.400
<v Speaker 3>you got to start over and they do all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

2513
02:04:59.670 --> 02:05:04.670
<v Speaker 3>They'll be working on high end cues and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll get like three quarters of the </v>

2514
02:05:04.670 --> 02:05:04.670
<v Speaker 3>way done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to scrap it.</v>

2515
02:05:04.670 --> 02:05:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Ernie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ernie,</v>

2516
02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:08.190
<v Speaker 3>as gina acu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a film with him.</v>

2517
02:05:08.191 --> 02:05:13.191
<v Speaker 3>That's on our youtube channel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's had to solve cues and half ivory </v>

2518
02:05:13.711 --> 02:05:16.200
<v Speaker 3>handled cues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2519
02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:21.260
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's because it goes back to the </v>

2520
02:05:21.260 --> 02:05:25.581
<v Speaker 3>craftsmanship aspect of no matter what </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is you make,</v>

2521
02:05:25.951 --> 02:05:30.951
<v Speaker 3>you talk about cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you love cars and you're a car </v>

2522

02:05:30.951 --> 02:05:34.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get these custom tuners are custom </v>

2524
02:05:34.130 --> 02:05:34.130
<v Speaker 3>builders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2525
02:05:34.130 --> 02:05:36.450
<v Speaker 3>if they have a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't afford that to be out there.</v>

2526
02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:39.750
<v Speaker 3>They can't let that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't let that car on the road.</v>

2527
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:43.870
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because one dog will fuck up 100.</v>

2528
02:05:43.950 --> 02:05:45.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the old saying,</v>

<v Speaker 3>perfect example,</v>

2538
02:06:09.330 --> 02:06:10.770
<v Speaker 3>a guy we both know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eric,</v>

2539
02:06:10.771 --> 02:06:14.400
<v Speaker 3>chris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy who makes a very,</v>

02:06:14.401 --> 02:06:17.490
<v Speaker 3>very in demand cues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cues are called sugartree cues.</v>

2541
02:06:17.850 --> 02:06:19.650
<v Speaker 3>When we first started our business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

2542
02:06:19.651 --> 02:06:22.140
<v Speaker 3>our company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was complete shoe string.</v>

2543
02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:25.140
<v Speaker 3>It was me and my partner Chad a pullman.</v>

2544
02:06:25.670 --> 02:06:30.670
<v Speaker 3>We'd started up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just we had to initial partners that </v>

2545
02:06:31.261 --> 02:06:33.450
<v Speaker 3>came in a truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And jason,</v>

2546
02:06:33.451 --> 02:06:38.451
<v Speaker 3>I just want to mention their names </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were important and what we </v>

2547
02:06:38.451 --> 02:06:38.451
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2548
02:06:38.451 --> 02:06:39.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a shoestring deal.</v>

2549
02:06:40.290 --> 02:06:42.030
<v Speaker 3>And anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2550
02:06:42.031 --> 02:06:43.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eric,</v>

2551
02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:45.120
<v Speaker 3>who's become a good friend of joe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>

2552
02:06:45.121 --> 02:06:47.730
<v Speaker 3>both out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

2553
02:06:47.731 --> 02:06:50.460
<v Speaker 3>he's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very in demand q maker at the time.</v>

2554
02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a backlog of years and years.</v>

2555
02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:57.030
<v Speaker 3>But that means if you wanted to buy a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cue from them,</v>

2556
02:06:57.031 --> 02:06:59.910
<v Speaker 3>you got to wait years and anymore where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can even build it.</v>

2557
02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:02.460
<v Speaker 3>And eric in particular doesn't even take</v>
<v Speaker 3>orders anymore.</v>

2558
02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:03.480
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2559
02:07:03.481 --> 02:07:05.160
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want one of his cues,</v>

2560
02:07:05.161 --> 02:07:07.620
<v Speaker 3>you have to either know him or get it on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the secondary market.</v>

2561
02:07:08.250 --> 02:07:08.910
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2562
02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:14.190
<v Speaker 3>I was at an event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was 2008 and I was a photographer and</v>

2563
02:07:14.191 --> 02:07:16.920
<v Speaker 3>when I started my company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to sell a,</v>

2564
02:07:17.070 --> 02:07:19.320
<v Speaker 3>one of my camera lenses to pay for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>trip.</v>

2565
02:07:20.090 --> 02:07:21.660
<v Speaker 3>And then for many photographers out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2566
02:07:21.661 --> 02:07:26.250
<v Speaker 3>it was a nikon 70 to 200 to eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a $1,500</v>

2567
02:07:26.251 --> 02:07:28.590
<v Speaker 3>lens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're going on this trip.</v>

2568
02:07:28.591 --> 02:07:32.430
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have any money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had to sell this lens and uh,</v>

2569
02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:35.230
<v Speaker 3>didn't really tell anybody about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

2570
02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:40.260
<v Speaker 3>it was to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a one of those things where it's </v>

2571
02:07:40.260 --> 02:07:40.260
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>

2572
02:07:40.260 --> 02:07:43.231
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't want to sell your </v>

2573
02:07:43.231 --> 02:07:43.231
<v Speaker 3>tools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2574
02:07:43.231 --> 02:07:43.231
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2575
02:07:43.231 --> 02:07:45.700
<v Speaker 3>we had made a commItment to be there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I did what I had to do.</v>

2576
02:07:46.270 --> 02:07:48.040
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2577
02:07:48.110 --> 02:07:53.110
<v Speaker 3>we're in an event maybe six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven months later and eric walks up </v>

2578
02:07:53.110 --> 02:07:53.940
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2579
02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:57.400
<v Speaker 3>out of nowhere he hands me a cue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2580
02:07:57.401 --> 02:07:58.330
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take this.</v>

2581
02:07:58.331 --> 02:08:00.910
<v Speaker 3>And use it to help you guys get doWn the</v>
<v Speaker 3>road.</v>

2582
02:08:01.690 --> 02:08:02.980
<v Speaker 3>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was stunned.</v>

2583
02:08:03.210 --> 02:08:06.520
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never met Him before and you know,</v>

2584
02:08:06.521 --> 02:08:08.380
<v Speaker 3>we started talking but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2585
02:08:08.381 --> 02:08:10.780
<v Speaker 3>and that sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't sound like much,</v>

2586
02:08:10.990 --> 02:08:11.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2587
02:08:11.650 --> 02:08:13.930
<v Speaker 3>somebody walk out and handing you a </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of wood or piece of pork,</v>

2588
02:08:13.931 --> 02:08:16.300
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is he walked up and handed</v>

2589
02:08:16.301 --> 02:08:17.890
<v Speaker 3>me two grand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2590
02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:20.200
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the nicest guys I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>met and you know,</v>

2591
02:08:20.201 --> 02:08:25.201
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what I did was I've taken a lot of </v>

2592
02:08:25.201 --> 02:08:28.021
<v Speaker 3>photos and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got some photos to unique photos </v>

2593
02:08:28.021 --> 02:08:29.620
<v Speaker 3>because I've been in places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2594
02:08:29.621 --> 02:08:33.700
<v Speaker 3>the old saying about being good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>photography is f eight and be there,</v>

2595
02:08:34.150 --> 02:08:39.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been lucky to be there for certain </v>

2596
02:08:39.150 --> 02:08:39.580
<v Speaker 3>things and a lot of my photos that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been taken.</v>

2597
02:08:39.690 --> 02:08:43.010
<v Speaker 3>The f eight and f eight is an f stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

2598
02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:48.820
<v Speaker 3>Lends adjustment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which it's basically f eight is in the </v>

2599
02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:48.820
<v Speaker 3>middle of the focal range.</v>

2600
02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:54.060
<v Speaker 3>So it allows you a depth of field to </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you can see like if you're going </v>

2601
02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:58.520
<v Speaker 3>to take a general photograph effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good spot to be so far and just be </v>

2602
02:08:58.520 --> 02:08:59.290
<v Speaker 3>there and you got to go to the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2603
02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:02.130
<v Speaker 3>F eight and be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of the joke about you.</v>

2604
02:09:02.150 --> 02:09:05.740
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to do any fancy trickery </v>
<v Speaker 3>or anything like that.</v>

2605
02:09:05.770 --> 02:09:10.180
<v Speaker 3>The big thing is have a basic setup but </v>
<v Speaker 3>be there when the shot is there.</v>

2606
02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:11.290
<v Speaker 3>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2607
02:09:11.291 --> 02:09:12.270
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2608
02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:18.000
<v Speaker 3>but I use that cue to purchase that lens</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I had sold before.</v>

2609
02:09:18.730 --> 02:09:21.610
<v Speaker 3>And since then a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost everything.</v>

2610
02:09:21.611 --> 02:09:22.480
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

2611
02:09:22.481 --> 02:09:27.481
<v Speaker 3>any one of the flyers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any type of like promotional shit that </v>

2612
02:09:27.481 --> 02:09:31.471
<v Speaker 3>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That photo was taken with the lens that </v>

2613

2615
02:09:33.851 --> 02:09:38.680
<v Speaker 3>that world of craftsmanship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of creating this really unique tool that</v>

2642
02:10:49.210 --> 02:10:50.650
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think gus cues,</v>

2643
02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:55.680
<v Speaker 3>certain gus cues go carry a higher level</v>
<v Speaker 3>of price in zamboni gustin body cues </v>

2644
02:10:58.810 --> 02:11:00.340
<v Speaker 3>were better made.</v>

2645
02:11:01.010 --> 02:11:06.010
<v Speaker 1>The playability is legendary and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of great players played with a zamboni </v>

2646
02:11:06.630 --> 02:11:08.490
<v Speaker 1>zamboni.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just one of those names like you,</v>

2647
02:11:08.491 --> 02:11:11.750
<v Speaker 1>he hear the names and bodie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the real,</v>

2648
02:11:11.751 --> 02:11:16.751
<v Speaker 1>like in this day and age like you here </v>
<v Speaker 1>at ballah bush baumbusch who is always </v>

2649
02:11:16.751 --> 02:11:16.751
<v Speaker 1>impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but zamboni is like,</v>

2650
02:11:16.751 --> 02:11:17.210
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to zamboni like,</v>

2651
02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:18.620
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2652
02:11:18.621 --> 02:11:21.140
<v Speaker 1>that's high level shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one thing.</v>

2653
02:11:21.141 --> 02:11:25.850
<v Speaker 1>And showman too much of more obscure </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the same level.</v>

2654
02:11:25.890 --> 02:11:27.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think john,</v>

2655
02:11:27.090 --> 02:11:30.330
<v Speaker 3>among the cognitive one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who know,</v>

2656
02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:34.740
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the cool things is </v>
<v Speaker 3>john and barry,</v>

2657
02:11:34.830 --> 02:11:39.180
<v Speaker 3>sam bodie are friends and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot in common with some of their,</v>

2658
02:11:39.210 --> 02:11:44.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like the traditional style design </v>

2659
02:11:44.210 --> 02:11:44.210
<v Speaker 3>work and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2660
02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:46.440
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a small,</v>

2661
02:11:46.441 --> 02:11:49.290
<v Speaker 3>small world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really fascinating.</v>

2662
02:11:49.620 --> 02:11:51.480
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing that's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2663
02:11:52.130 --> 02:11:53.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2664
02:11:53.730 --> 02:11:56.520
<v Speaker 3>if somebody out there today said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay cool,</v>

2665
02:11:56.521 --> 02:11:58.800
<v Speaker 3>I want to learn more about these cues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they find out,</v>

2666
02:11:58.801 --> 02:11:59.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you want to go get one,</v>

2667
02:12:00.150 --> 02:12:01.620
<v Speaker 3>you can't buy one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2668
02:12:01.770 --> 02:12:03.150
<v Speaker 3>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2669
02:12:03.151 --> 02:12:08.151
<v Speaker 3>you can buy one on the secondary market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it'd be ridiculously priced and </v>

2670
02:12:08.151 --> 02:12:09.990
<v Speaker 3>super expensive if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you call barry,</v>

2671
02:12:10.290 --> 02:12:12.900
<v Speaker 3>he might take your call on and he'll be </v>
<v Speaker 3>gracious to you,</v>

2672
02:12:13.650 --> 02:12:16.530
<v Speaker 3>but barry's never going to fill his </v>
<v Speaker 3>order book.</v>

2673
02:12:17.070 --> 02:12:17.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2674
02:12:17.690 --> 02:12:18.330
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2675
02:12:18.331 --> 02:12:19.520
<v Speaker 3>I love the guy to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2676
02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:22.080
<v Speaker 3>god bless him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope he lives to be 100 years old,</v>

2677
02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:24.660
<v Speaker 3>but chances are he's never going to fill</v>
<v Speaker 3>his order book</v>

2678
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:29.870
<v Speaker 1>because so many people want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of demand that he </v>

2679
02:12:29.870 --> 02:12:29.870
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2680
02:12:29.870 --> 02:12:31.790
<v Speaker 1>and you said cognitive sending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my best accuses a joe goal,</v>

2682
02:12:34.171 --> 02:12:39.171
<v Speaker 1>this small group of people that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>these high end instruments for this </v>

2683
02:12:39.870 --> 02:12:43.540
<v Speaker 1>obscure dying game and it is dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to a guy like you are,</v>

<v Speaker 1>guy like you were shy.</v>

2685
02:12:45.271 --> 02:12:50.271
<v Speaker 1>They were extremely valuable because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize like if you can get ahold of </v>

2686
02:12:50.271 --> 02:12:50.850
<v Speaker 1>an ebony on avenue southwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2687

02:12:53.941 --> 02:12:55.620
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2689
02:12:55.621 --> 02:12:58.550
<v Speaker 1>you're obligated to buy it because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized like this.</v>

2690
02:12:58.710 --> 02:13:01.890
<v Speaker 1>They're not making that many of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna come a point in time where</v>

2691
02:13:01.891 --> 02:13:04.320
<v Speaker 1>you run out of 58 corvettes that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist anymore,</v>

2692
02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:07.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no more 58 corvettes and shit.</v>

2693
02:13:07.390 --> 02:13:09.790
<v Speaker 3>And that's where a lot of the older q </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

2694
02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:10.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2695
02:13:10.620 --> 02:13:12.660
<v Speaker 3>like we were speaking about the older </v>
<v Speaker 3>makers,</v>

2696
02:13:13.010 --> 02:13:13.620
<v Speaker 3>gus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sam,</v>

2697
02:13:13.650 --> 02:13:14.720
<v Speaker 3>bodie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ballad,</v>

2698
02:13:14.740 --> 02:13:19.740
<v Speaker 3>bush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have guys like john </v>

2699
02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:22.651
<v Speaker 3>shullman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think john shullman went through a </v>

2700
02:13:22.651 --> 02:13:22.960
<v Speaker 3>period of time where he might've made 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>q's in three years.</v>

2701
02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:24.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2702
02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:29.700
<v Speaker 3>when we talk about these guys a perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another perfect example is dennis </v>

2703
02:13:29.700 --> 02:13:32.300
<v Speaker 3>searing a who is arguably a lot of cute </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

2704
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:34.780
<v Speaker 3>considered the top guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2705
02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:37.950
<v Speaker 3>his cues probably have the highest </v>
<v Speaker 3>resale value.</v>

2706
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:39.750
<v Speaker 3>They're insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2707
02:13:39.870 --> 02:13:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a plain cubes,</v>

2708
02:13:41.091 --> 02:13:42.620
<v Speaker 1>like 4,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000,</v>

2709
02:13:42.621 --> 02:13:45.230
<v Speaker 1>$6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>grand for what looks like a house q.</v>

2710
02:13:45.650 --> 02:13:50.650
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing thing that a guy's </v>

2711
02:13:50.650 --> 02:13:53.930
<v Speaker 1>excellence commitment to exacting </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards can really be,</v>

2712
02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:55.910
<v Speaker 1>can manifest itself in that sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2713
02:13:55.911 --> 02:14:00.911
<v Speaker 1>And that's what in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where pool cues and that's where </v>

2714
02:14:00.911 --> 02:14:03.200
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this art form sort of like,</v>

2715
02:14:03.220 --> 02:14:03.510
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2716
02:14:03.540 --> 02:14:06.000
<v Speaker 1>it parallels everything else in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2717
02:14:06.050 --> 02:14:08.690
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing as like if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beatles were playing,</v>

2718
02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:10.490
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to go and see them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2719
02:14:10.491 --> 02:14:15.491
<v Speaker 1>it really is the same thing almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this just this boundless </v>

2720
02:14:16.191 --> 02:14:16.700
<v Speaker 1>energy</v>

2721
02:14:16.810 --> 02:14:21.810
<v Speaker 3>to achieve excellence and that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's in this very specific space for</v>

2722
02:14:22.601 --> 02:14:27.601
<v Speaker 3>this very specific purpose that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>four or 5,000</v>

2723
02:14:28.571 --> 02:14:32.650
<v Speaker 3>people on this earth will understand or </v>
<v Speaker 3>get or give a fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their engineering away from the </v>

2821
02:18:35.981 --> 02:18:36.340
<v Speaker 1>transmission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no more manual transfers.</v>

2822
02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:40.430
<v Speaker 3>That was always the thing with the nine </v>

02:18:47.070 --> 02:18:48.060

<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

2827
02:18:48.061 --> 02:18:50.400
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back before anybody read books,</v>

2828
02:18:50.580 --> 02:18:52.620
<v Speaker 1>they put the engine in the back of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>

2829
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:56.460
<v Speaker 1>it's behind the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's behind the rear axle.</v>

2830
02:18:56.461 --> 02:19:01.461
<v Speaker 1>It's a stupid place for the engine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>back then the cars only weighed 2000 </v>

2831
02:19:02.371 --> 02:19:07.371
<v Speaker 1>plus pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only had 150 horsepower at the </v>

2832
02:19:07.371 --> 02:19:07.420
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2833
02:19:07.470 --> 02:19:12.470
<v Speaker 1>when they were designing these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had really narrow tires and they </v>

2834
02:19:12.470 --> 02:19:16.701
<v Speaker 1>were really slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you went around a corner and </v>

2835
02:19:16.701 --> 02:19:16.701
<v Speaker 1>your gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gas the wrong time,</v>

2836
02:19:16.701 --> 02:19:20.601
<v Speaker 1>your asset with totally kicked out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were notorious for what's called </v>

2837
02:19:20.601 --> 02:19:24.470
<v Speaker 1>oversteering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning like as you're turning the car </v>

2838
02:19:24.470 --> 02:19:28.011
<v Speaker 1>steers further than you would like it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people out how to drive with </v>

2839
02:19:28.191 --> 02:19:29.730
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured out how to walk,</v>

2840
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:34.750
<v Speaker 1>brought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought in the rear axle or broaden the </v>

2841
02:19:34.750 --> 02:19:35.630
<v Speaker 1>tires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather stretch out the,</v>

2842
02:19:35.631 --> 02:19:36.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real,</v>

2843
02:19:37.130 --> 02:19:42.130
<v Speaker 1>the rear stance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then figuring out how to accelerate </v>

2844
02:19:42.130 --> 02:19:42.130
<v Speaker 1>at a corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into them slow.</v>

2845
02:19:42.130 --> 02:19:45.770
<v Speaker 1>But then the traction of having the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight below the back wheels like allows</v>

2846
02:19:45.771 --> 02:19:50.771
<v Speaker 1>you to actually kick off quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It allows you to very fast zero to 60 </v>

2847
02:19:50.771 --> 02:19:52.430
<v Speaker 1>acceleration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a lot of good things.</v>

2848
02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:57.670
<v Speaker 1>If you know how to drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got the ass on the drive wheels so it </v>

2849
02:19:57.670 --> 02:20:00.851
<v Speaker 1>puts the weight over him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting because they </v>

2850
02:20:00.851 --> 02:20:03.190
<v Speaker 1>basically have spent the past several </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades trying to engineer their way </v>

2851
02:20:03.651 --> 02:20:06.650
<v Speaker 1>around a terrible idea and they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>another car.</v>

2852
02:20:06.651 --> 02:20:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Here's the number one problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Porsche has a call called the caYman and</v>

2853
02:20:10.131 --> 02:20:12.530
<v Speaker 1>the cayman's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should call iT entry.</v>

2854
02:20:12.620 --> 02:20:12.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2855
02:20:12.791 --> 02:20:13.760
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the cayenne.</v>

2856
02:20:13.790 --> 02:20:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Cayenne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the?</v>

2857
02:20:14.620 --> 02:20:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Cayman is a very small mid engine car </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a beautiful car now.</v>

2858
02:20:19.551 --> 02:20:22.190
<v Speaker 1>It used to be ugly as shit back when </v>
<v Speaker 1>portia had the nine,</v>

2859
02:20:22.191 --> 02:20:22.940
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

2860
02:20:23.080 --> 02:20:23.650
<v Speaker 1>the nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine.</v>

2861
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Six was the first water cooled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was cheap when?</v>

2862
02:20:26.840 --> 02:20:27.800
<v Speaker 1>What was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2863
02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:30.980
<v Speaker 1>that's the boxster box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The boxers that came in with a roof over</v>

2864
02:20:30.981 --> 02:20:33.020
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But see the boxster,</v>

2865
02:20:33.050 --> 02:20:34.490
<v Speaker 1>that's the cayman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the new one.</v>

2866
02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:38.180
<v Speaker 1>It's dope as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they have to keep an underpowered.</v>

2867
02:20:38.330 --> 02:20:40.790
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's not a rear engine car.</v>

2868
02:20:40.791 --> 02:20:43.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a mid engine car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's balanced as much better.</v>

2869
02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:47.330
<v Speaker 1>It handles much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Its acceleration is prime.</v>

2870
02:20:47.331 --> 02:20:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they have to keep it about 3:25,</v>

2871
02:20:51.021 --> 02:20:52.780
<v Speaker 1>3:50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximum athletic.</v>

2872
02:20:52.850 --> 02:20:54.740
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about 3:50</v>
<v Speaker 1>is under powered.</v>

2873
02:20:54.850 --> 02:20:59.850
<v Speaker 1>It's powered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My porsche has 502 years.</v>

2874
02:21:00.350 --> 02:21:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Our role driver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2875
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:02.040
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2876
02:21:02.041 --> 02:21:02.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2877
02:21:02.481 --> 02:21:02.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2878
02:21:02.781 --> 02:21:04.520
<v Speaker 1>It's rear wheel drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a savage.</v>

2879
02:21:04.521 --> 02:21:07.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm a man for that fucking all wheel </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>

2880
02:21:07.810 --> 02:21:10.690
<v Speaker 1>that's the government trying to shrink </v>
<v Speaker 1>your deck.</v>

2881
02:21:11.140 --> 02:21:13.910
<v Speaker 1>I saw that is they're trying to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>away your testosterone.</v>

2882
02:21:14.210 --> 02:21:17.030
<v Speaker 1>The rear drive is where it's at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to drive a sports car,</v>

2883
02:21:17.031 --> 02:21:22.031
<v Speaker 1>especially a porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rear wheel drive and it's a wide </v>

2884
02:21:22.031 --> 02:21:22.031
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

2885
02:21:22.031 --> 02:21:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to have a big fat rear set</v>

2886
02:21:24.351 --> 02:21:29.351
<v Speaker 1>of tires and a lot of god damn power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you better know what the fuck </v>

2887
02:21:29.351 --> 02:21:29.351
<v Speaker 1>happens when that 60 slash 40 gets out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of whack.</v>

2888
02:21:29.351 --> 02:21:33.730
<v Speaker 1>You gotta know how to counter steer so </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick in New York.</v>

2889
02:21:33.790 --> 02:21:38.790
<v Speaker 1>he should go naturally aspirated to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking around with those turbo </v>

2890
02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:38.790
<v Speaker 1>chargers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2891
02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:43.241
<v Speaker 1>they're cute and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't even make the same sound </v>

2892
02:21:43.241 --> 02:21:44.150
<v Speaker 1>like half of the fun of an engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about your mustang?</v>

2893
02:21:44.151 --> 02:21:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Your mustang's got a surplus </v>
<v Speaker 1>supercharging.</v>

2894
02:21:45.801 --> 02:21:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

2895
02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Supercharges okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it doesn't take away from the </v>

2896
02:21:51.910 --> 02:21:51.910
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It adds a little extra sound,</v>

2897
02:21:51.910 --> 02:21:51.910
<v Speaker 1>lads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little wine.</v>

2898
02:21:53.020 --> 02:21:56.780
<v Speaker 1>It adds that little shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little fucking robo cop to the va.</v>

2899
02:21:56.840 --> 02:22:00.200
<v Speaker 1>It actually is kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a turbo charge is a real problem.</v>

2900
02:22:00.201 --> 02:22:02.290
<v Speaker 1>And turbo charges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get the full.</v>

2901
02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Well the men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legs sort of have.</v>

2902
02:22:04.641 --> 02:22:07.880
<v Speaker 1>They got rid of barely noticeable now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have twin turbos.</v>

2903
02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.850
<v Speaker 1>So like a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the nissan gtr or the nine slash 11</v>

2904
02:22:10.851 --> 02:22:13.850
<v Speaker 1>turbo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely noticeable in less.</v>

2905
02:22:13.970 --> 02:22:16.880
<v Speaker 1>You'd geT ahold of a gt three if you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hold of the gt three,</v>

2906
02:22:16.881 --> 02:22:18.920
<v Speaker 1>that's the race card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They allow you to drive in the street.</v>

2907
02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:23.120
<v Speaker 1>That car is totally naturally aspirated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my car revs up,</v>

2908
02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:26.910
<v Speaker 1>I have a gt three rs and it revs up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>8,800</v>

2909
02:22:26.911 --> 02:22:28.440
<v Speaker 1>rpm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

2910
02:22:28.441 --> 02:22:31.840
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it's going up like that,</v>

2911
02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:38.320
<v Speaker 1>that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the gt three minds at gt three </v>

2912
02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:39.120
<v Speaker 1>rs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you google gt three rs,</v>

2913
02:22:39.121 --> 02:22:42.480
<v Speaker 1>shark works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a one that I sent to this company</v>

2914
02:22:42.481 --> 02:22:47.481
<v Speaker 1>in northern content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got like a gt three rs and then </v>

2915
02:22:47.481 --> 02:22:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not crazy thing.</v>

2916
02:22:47.610 --> 02:22:52.610
<v Speaker 1>You've got to put some more shadow to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the baddest motherfuckers porsche </v>

2917
02:22:52.610 --> 02:22:56.270
<v Speaker 1>aftermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they take it and they changed </v>

2918
02:22:56.270 --> 02:22:56.270
<v Speaker 1>the suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every bump it goes over.</v>

2919
02:22:56.270 --> 02:22:57.390
<v Speaker 1>It hurts my balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2920
02:22:57.960 --> 02:22:59.220
<v Speaker 1>but I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

2921
02:22:59.221 --> 02:23:00.120
<v Speaker 1>It's so loud.</v>

2922
02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Tell you the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing you did that I will always.</v>

2923
02:23:03.011 --> 02:23:04.930
<v Speaker 3>And I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious,</v>

2924
02:23:04.931 --> 02:23:07.630
<v Speaker 3>I want to ask you this question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much,</v>

2925
02:23:07.690 --> 02:23:09.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2926
02:23:09.431 --> 02:23:10.390
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>

2927
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:15.630
<v Speaker 3>what's your opinion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the car you had built on </v>

2928
02:23:15.630 --> 02:23:16.540
<v Speaker 3>rides the sick fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2929
02:23:16.660 --> 02:23:18.720
<v Speaker 3>I think that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2930
02:23:18.730 --> 02:23:23.730
<v Speaker 3>that's always stuck with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you'd get that from a lot of car </v>

2931
02:23:23.730 --> 02:23:23.730
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

2932
02:23:23.730 --> 02:23:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love it,</v>

2933
02:23:23.730 --> 02:23:28.401
<v Speaker 1>but I give them the reality of driviNg </v>
<v Speaker 1>that car and driving that car for a few </v>

2934
02:23:28.401 --> 02:23:30.990
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>IT broke down so many fucking times,</v>

2935
02:23:31.350 --> 02:23:35.730
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to say this without being </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative at all.</v>

2936
02:23:35.790 --> 02:23:40.790
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of issues in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction of this car behind the </v>

2937
02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:44.301
<v Speaker 1>scenes that allowed me to see things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't know about the car world </v>

2938
02:23:46.021 --> 02:23:48.630
<v Speaker 1>that mirrored the world of construction </v>
<v Speaker 1>of homes,</v>

2939
02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:53.880
<v Speaker 1>mirrored the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fuckery that goes on </v>

2940
02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:55.740
<v Speaker 1>and and unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's the guys who made it,</v>

2941
02:23:55.790 --> 02:23:58.130
<v Speaker 1>what chip foose designed it and troy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>

2942
02:23:58.131 --> 02:23:59.640
<v Speaker 1>they built it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did a great fucking job,</v>

2943
02:23:59.641 --> 02:24:04.641
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bunch of other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in these transactions that you </v>

2944
02:24:04.641 --> 02:24:08.511
<v Speaker 1>have to deal with it or not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant but unpleasant to the point </v>

2945
02:24:08.511 --> 02:24:12.351
<v Speaker 1>where they inspiring murderous thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had to deal with these people to </v>

2946
02:24:12.351 --> 02:24:16.311
<v Speaker 1>the point where I had to get on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone and raise my voice and I don't </v>

2947
02:24:16.311 --> 02:24:16.311
<v Speaker 1>like doing that.</v>

2948
02:24:16.311 --> 02:24:17.100
<v Speaker 1>And so There was a weirdness attached to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that car.</v>

2949
02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:19.800
<v Speaker 1>And then there was the fact they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do what I wanted them to do.</v>

2950
02:24:19.801 --> 02:24:21.690
<v Speaker 1>I wanted them to make a car that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>

2951
02:24:22.110 --> 02:24:23.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted a car that,</v>

2952
02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:26.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a car that they did on the show</v>

2953
02:24:26.191 --> 02:24:31.191
<v Speaker 1>was called rides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a 67 fastback mustang they </v>

2954
02:24:31.191 --> 02:24:35.121
<v Speaker 1>built that was fucking beautiful and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a normal lifted suspension,</v>

2955
02:24:35.941 --> 02:24:40.941
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal height off the ground so you can </v>

2956
02:24:40.941 --> 02:24:40.941
<v Speaker 1>drive it around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I wanted to do.</v>

2957
02:24:40.941 --> 02:24:44.281
<v Speaker 1>I wonder the muscle car to drive around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they made me this lower chop thing </v>

2958
02:24:44.281 --> 02:24:47.500
<v Speaker 1>with giant wheels and super complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and show tricks.</v>

2959
02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Total show car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was driving into the comedy store </v>

2960
02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:53.000
<v Speaker 1>every weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't give a fuck.</v>

2961
02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:54.870
<v Speaker 1>This thing was not doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would leave me stranded.</v>

2962
02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:58.470
<v Speaker 1>It left me stranded several times and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more scary than that.</v>

2963
02:24:58.500 --> 02:25:03.500
<v Speaker 1>One day I came home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pulled into my driveway and I'm </v>

2964
02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:05.670
<v Speaker 1>turning to get into the garage and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>car bank leans to the side.</v>

2965
02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:07.050
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it right here.</v>

2966
02:25:07.260 --> 02:25:10.440
<v Speaker 1>This is what one of the few days where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled it into the comedy store.</v>

2967
02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:13.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still love it,</v>

2968
02:25:13.741 --> 02:25:16.090
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To this day I kind of miss it.</v>

2969
02:25:16.310 --> 02:25:19.590
<v Speaker 1>I like the fact that you didn't fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the foods to tone trap.</v>

2970
02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That mother fucker tried to turn my car </v>

2971
02:25:24.740 --> 02:25:24.740
<v Speaker 1>into a spanish hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not happening.</v>

2972
02:25:24.740 --> 02:25:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love silver.</v>

2973
02:25:26.381 --> 02:25:28.060
<v Speaker 1>that's silver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Color is beautiful.</v>

2974
02:25:28.061 --> 02:25:31.240
<v Speaker 1>It's so gorgeous and it accentuates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape of the car.</v>

2975
02:25:31.900 --> 02:25:36.900
<v Speaker 1>So I pulled into my driveway and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden the car leans to the left,</v>

2976
02:25:37.571 --> 02:25:40.990
<v Speaker 1>like clunk and I get out and I look in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wheel.</v>

2977
02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Has the suspension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is separated from the frame and the </v>

2978
02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:47.230
<v Speaker 1>weirdest wheel is going sideways into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fender.</v>

2979
02:25:47.230 --> 02:25:49.540
<v Speaker 1>The fender is bent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>HoLy shit.</v>

2980
02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:51.460
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just on the highway.</v>

2981
02:25:51.580 --> 02:25:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2982
02:25:52.151 --> 02:25:53.410
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on the highway,</v>

2983
02:25:53.411 --> 02:25:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I was going 70 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll could've fell off easily.</v>

2984
02:25:57.460 --> 02:25:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I would have been dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

2985
02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I had a three point harness and a have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>roll cage.</v>

2986
02:26:02.290 --> 02:26:04.180
<v Speaker 1>So maybe I'm exaggerating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might not be dead,</v>

2987
02:26:04.181 --> 02:26:06.730
<v Speaker 1>but I might be concussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might've been fucked up.</v>

2988
02:26:06.731 --> 02:26:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows when it could have happened,</v>

2989
02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:11.500
<v Speaker 1>it could have been run over by a semi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything could have happened.</v>

2990
02:26:11.650 --> 02:26:16.650
<v Speaker 1>And so I brought it to this guy in simi </v>
<v Speaker 1>valley and uh,</v>

2991
02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I had mr steve troop and I had him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just put the best possible </v>

2992
02:26:22.751 --> 02:26:24.730
<v Speaker 1>suspension on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fix it up,</v>

2993
02:26:24.940 --> 02:26:27.430
<v Speaker 1>make it cut all the bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they fuck up,</v>

2994
02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:29.020
<v Speaker 1>fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raise it a little.</v>

2995
02:26:29.110 --> 02:26:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Keeps bottoming out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2996
02:26:30.490 --> 02:26:31.360
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out.</v>

2997
02:26:31.390 --> 02:26:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Find out why these bolts separated from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the suspension,</v>

2998
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:36.190
<v Speaker 1>but they figured out something just </v>
<v Speaker 1>break.</v>

2999
02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:37.480
<v Speaker 1>It was too low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was too low.</v>

3000
02:26:37.481 --> 02:26:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Is bottoming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so loud.</v>

3001
02:26:39.161 --> 02:26:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't hear when it was bottoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3002
02:26:40.930 --> 02:26:45.670
<v Speaker 1>It was the most ridiculously rugged ride</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the history of automobiles.</v>

3003
02:26:45.671 --> 02:26:50.671
<v Speaker 1>It was about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sound was so loud.</v>

<v Speaker 1>engine.</v>

02:35:10.140 --> 02:35:13.920
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever took him about 20 seconds </v>
<v Speaker 3>before he hit 20 seconds?</v>

3182
02:35:15.270 --> 02:35:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Think about 20 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably why it's probably an </v>

3183
02:35:20.270 --> 02:35:20.620
<v Speaker 3>overestimation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but five,</v>

3210
02:36:29.101 --> 02:36:29.380
<v Speaker 3>it comes crashing directly and it's </v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3235
02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:29.760
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the biggest issues about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these wars is bringing these young </v>

3236
02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:34.721
<v Speaker 1>people home and giving them no tools to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with the kind of trauma that </v>

3237
02:37:34.721 --> 02:37:39.251
<v Speaker 1>they've seen and the reality that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've experienced and how much </v>

3238
02:37:39.251 --> 02:37:42.071
<v Speaker 1>different that reality is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the reality of me or of a normal </v>

3239
02:37:42.071 --> 02:37:45.911
<v Speaker 1>person who has not gone to war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a totally different </v>

3240
02:37:45.911 --> 02:37:49.391
<v Speaker 1>type of human with completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewiring the possibilities of reality </v>

3241
02:37:49.700 --> 02:37:51.920
<v Speaker 1>and what's fucked up is this country has</v>
<v Speaker 1>done it.</v>

3242
02:37:52.290 --> 02:37:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Every war they've ever had to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>until somebody,</v>

3243
02:37:55.920 --> 02:37:59.150
<v Speaker 1>they can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 world war one,</v>

3244
02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:01.910
<v Speaker 1>world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's 2000.</v>

3245
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Twenty seven is going to be our robots </v>
<v Speaker 1>kIlled your robots do you give up and </v>

3246
02:38:06.910 --> 02:38:07.160
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

3247
02:38:07.490 --> 02:38:09.260
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>drone.</v>

3248
02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated with the drone drones </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus drones.</v>

3249
02:38:13.491 --> 02:38:18.491
<v Speaker 1>Robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever think it will be drones </v>

3250
02:38:18.491 --> 02:38:18.491
<v Speaker 1>versus drones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3251
02:38:18.491 --> 02:38:19.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe it will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what.</v>

3252
02:38:19.511 --> 02:38:22.100
<v Speaker 1>That's when it starts getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting now it sucks.</v>

3253
02:38:22.101 --> 02:38:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's scary is drones versus humans.</v>

3254
02:38:24.100 --> 02:38:25.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it too easy.</v>

3255
02:38:26.030 --> 02:38:31.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like trannies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a male transvestite </v>

3256
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.840
<v Speaker 1>transsexual fighting against female </v>
<v Speaker 1>trans.</v>

3257
02:38:31.841 --> 02:38:32.870
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got me.</v>

3258
02:38:32.950 --> 02:38:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

3259
02:38:33.860 --> 02:38:38.860
<v Speaker 1>That's an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people in the </v>

3260
02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:39.020
<v Speaker 1>transvestite transgender community that </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that,</v>

3261
02:38:39.021 --> 02:38:44.021
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a transphobia because I made some </v>

3262
02:38:44.021 --> 02:38:44.021
<v Speaker 1>comments about a woman who used to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3263
02:38:44.060 --> 02:38:46.310
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing but love for that woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>that used to be a man.</v>

3264
02:38:46.370 --> 02:38:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing but love for anybody.</v>

3265
02:38:48.350 --> 02:38:53.350
<v Speaker 1>But I am coming at anything to </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely from the point of fairness </v>

3266
02:38:54.051 --> 02:38:55.730
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to combat sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

3267
02:38:55.770 --> 02:39:00.770
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could give zero fucks if you want to </v>

3268
02:39:00.770 --> 02:39:01.970
<v Speaker 1>be a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he would rather be a woman.</v>

3269
02:39:02.180 --> 02:39:05.230
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a navy seal that was.</v>

3270
02:39:05.350 --> 02:39:05.980
<v Speaker 1>There was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3271

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A warrior princess princess.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian cowen,</v>

3274
02:39:12.470 --> 02:39:17.470
<v Speaker 1>my boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He interviewed one of his podcasts or </v>

3275
02:39:17.470 --> 02:39:17.840
<v Speaker 1>her on his podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm full.</v>

3276
02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:19.190
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3277
02:39:19.280 --> 02:39:24.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm asked pro gender equality as I am </v>

3278
02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:27.581
<v Speaker 1>pro gun control or pro gun ownership </v>
<v Speaker 1>should say I should usually be able to </v>

3279
02:39:27.581 --> 02:39:29.060
<v Speaker 1>do whatever the fuck you want and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I'm at.</v>

3280
02:39:29.450 --> 02:39:31.200
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with,</v>

3281
02:39:31.250 --> 02:39:34.160
<v Speaker 1>with a person like that man woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the proper,</v>

3282
02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:38.600
<v Speaker 1>it's a woman wants the trends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's how I would accept that.</v>

3283
02:39:38.690 --> 02:39:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Any person who who served their nation </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that capacity,</v>

3284
02:39:42.530 --> 02:39:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean any person she can do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck they want,</v>

3285
02:39:45.830 --> 02:39:48.320
<v Speaker 1>but the fact of it is that they got your</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

3286
02:39:48.340 --> 02:39:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

3287
02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:51.860
<v Speaker 1>They have my respect as well and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what man,</v>

3288
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:56.780
<v Speaker 1>at any kid who grows up that is growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>up as a boy but wishes he was a girl,</v>

3289
02:39:57.020 --> 02:39:58.910
<v Speaker 1>they have my respect to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3290
02:39:58.911 --> 02:40:03.911
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transgender community that have been </v>

3291
02:40:03.911 --> 02:40:03.911
<v Speaker 1>upset at me about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3292
02:40:03.911 --> 02:40:07.030
<v Speaker 1>this issue about this mma fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but me,</v>

3293
02:40:07.320 --> 02:40:09.870
<v Speaker 1>it has nothing to do with anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>except combat sports.</v>

3294
02:40:09.871 --> 02:40:13.200
<v Speaker 1>That's to me is a legit issue because </v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about,</v>

3295
02:40:13.201 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

3296
02:40:14.580 --> 02:40:16.680
<v Speaker 3>this thing is not like the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well</v>

3297
02:40:16.860 --> 02:40:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I know whY I know it because of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really isn't.</v>

3298
02:40:19.780 --> 02:40:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Well there's not equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's variations inside the male frame</v>

3299
02:40:23.821 --> 02:40:24.960
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3300
02:40:24.990 --> 02:40:29.990
<v Speaker 1>and I have experienced tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits from being on the fortunate </v>

3301
02:40:29.990 --> 02:40:34.971
<v Speaker 1>side of certain genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have man hands a big fat stupid </v>

3302
02:40:34.971 --> 02:40:38.730
<v Speaker 1>man hands and if you put a woman in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dress and if she had these manhattan's,</v>

3303
02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:40.740
<v Speaker 1>she'd be a dangerous bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3304
02:40:40.741 --> 02:40:44.130
<v Speaker 1>that's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair that the male frame is not</v>

3305
02:40:44.131 --> 02:40:44.720
<v Speaker 1>fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3306
02:40:44.721 --> 02:40:48.630
<v Speaker 1>the male hips are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Renee richards sucked as a man,</v>

3307
02:40:48.631 --> 02:40:52.770
<v Speaker 1>as a tennis player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But dominated bitches as a woman,</v>

3308
02:40:53.190 --> 02:40:53.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

3309
02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:55.100
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

3310
02:40:55.200 --> 02:41:00.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of competition and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any problem with that competition </v>

3311
02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:02.140
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to anything involving </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything other than physical damage.</v>

3312
02:41:02.260 --> 02:41:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Don't get to beat somebody up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly my,</v>

3313
02:41:05.340 --> 02:41:10.340
<v Speaker 1>if it was baseball and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>this girl who used to be a guy's now </v>

3314
02:41:10.340 --> 02:41:10.890
<v Speaker 1>awesome at baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tough shit.</v>

3315
02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Get better at baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3316
02:41:12.470 --> 02:41:12.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3317
02:41:12.771 --> 02:41:17.771
<v Speaker 1>the interesting thing about transgenders</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to non combat sports as </v>

3318
02:41:17.771 --> 02:41:19.470
<v Speaker 1>they've never achieved world </v>
<v Speaker 1>championship status.</v>

3319
02:41:19.530 --> 02:41:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the most famous is renee richards </v>

3320
02:41:24.530 --> 02:41:27.650
<v Speaker 1>who became like 20th in the nation as </v>
<v Speaker 1>top level as a professional tennis </v>

3321
02:41:27.661 --> 02:41:32.661
<v Speaker 1>player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that a dude who used to be a </v>

3322
02:41:32.661 --> 02:41:34.160
<v Speaker 1>dude who became a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3323
02:41:34.270 --> 02:41:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Becomes a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a woman now still can't be the best</v>

3324
02:41:39.030 --> 02:41:44.030
<v Speaker 3>how double x chromosome women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because to me it goes back to what we </v>

3325
02:41:44.341 --> 02:41:49.341
<v Speaker 3>talked about excellence at at any level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what you know.</v>

3326
02:41:49.860 --> 02:41:54.860
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying that if you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>excellence you would accept the natural </v>

3327
02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:54.860
<v Speaker 3>born gender that you're born with?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3328
02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:54.860
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3329
02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:55.620
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sexual identities,</v>

3330
02:41:55.621 --> 02:42:00.621
<v Speaker 3>or just in your mind saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a genetic strength advantage cannot </v>

3331
02:42:00.621 --> 02:42:04.821
<v Speaker 3>overcome someone who has the drive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>willingness to be great.</v>

3332
02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:08.040
<v Speaker 3>That's all good on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can and it can't.</v>

3333
02:42:08.310 --> 02:42:09.810
<v Speaker 3>It depends on what the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the,</v>

3334
02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:10.740
<v Speaker 3>what the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3335
02:42:10.770 --> 02:42:13.170
<v Speaker 3>you take a per.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a perfect example.</v>

3336
02:42:13.380 --> 02:42:17.880
<v Speaker 3>You take a mediocre run of the mill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Male pro.</v>

3337
02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3338
02:42:20.330 --> 02:42:25.330
<v Speaker 3>Actually this is probably a bad example </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's a pretty big disparity </v>

3339
02:42:25.330 --> 02:42:29.000
<v Speaker 3>in pool between men and women players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy because there shouldn't </v>

3340
02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:29.000
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I needed to.</v>

3341
02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.980
<v Speaker 3>Do I need to get on the woman's pro tour</v>

<v Speaker 3>GuaranTee you could pay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's a professional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woman's guaranteed.</v>

<v Speaker 3>If you had to get beat and he got beat </v>

<v Speaker 3>by guy young kim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot worse things.</v>

3349
02:42:55.111 --> 02:42:57.420
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot worse things in life to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>home and sleep,</v>

3350
02:42:57.421 --> 02:43:00.930
<v Speaker 3>to contemplate before you sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditate before you sleep.</v>

3351
02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:02.760
<v Speaker 3>You say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's.</v>

3352
02:43:02.761 --> 02:43:07.761
<v Speaker 3>If I get crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I get crazy and I dedicated my life </v>

3353
02:43:07.761 --> 02:43:07.800
<v Speaker 3>to that shit still too late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a deck.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>

3357
02:43:12.260 --> 02:43:17.260
<v Speaker 1>It's too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you involve mushrooms in the </v>

3358
02:43:17.260 --> 02:43:17.260
<v Speaker 1>equation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

3359
02:43:17.260 --> 02:43:21.240
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't prove you wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every great pool player I know was </v>

3360
02:43:21.311 --> 02:43:22.970
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time they were 21,</v>

3361
02:43:23.020 --> 02:43:25.030
<v Speaker 1>they didn't do mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they did do mushrooms,</v>

3362
02:43:25.031 --> 02:43:30.031
<v Speaker 1>they would realize that you can have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebirth in any point in time and then </v>

<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

3365
02:43:32.110 --> 02:43:34.060
<v Speaker 1>There's no benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was a benefit,</v>

3366
02:43:34.420 --> 02:43:37.070
<v Speaker 1>if there was some fucking money,</v>

02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:25.780
<v Speaker 1>It smells like gas stinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tried to take a corner of the fucking</v>

3409
02:45:25.781 --> 02:45:30.781
<v Speaker 1>ass and slides out on you the brakes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lock up and leave these big black </v>

3410
02:45:30.781 --> 02:45:32.970
<v Speaker 1>patches when a fucking cat runs in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the road.</v>

3411
02:45:32.980 --> 02:45:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got this fucking ufo in the </v>

3412
02:45:37.980 --> 02:45:39.090
<v Speaker 1>garage over what ruined me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a nine,</v>

3413
02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:39.930
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

3414
02:45:40.300 --> 02:45:42.930
<v Speaker 1>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three or 2004,</v>

3415
02:45:42.940 --> 02:45:44.980
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11 turbo.</v>

3416
02:45:45.130 --> 02:45:50.130
<v Speaker 1>That ruined me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That mother fucker ruined me because it </v>

3417
02:45:50.130 --> 02:45:50.130
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was four wheel drive.</v>

3418
02:45:50.130 --> 02:45:54.810
<v Speaker 1>It was zero to 60 in under four secoNds </v>
<v Speaker 1>or he's the stupidest car I've ever had </v>

3419
02:45:54.810 --> 02:45:58.591
<v Speaker 1>in my life and I had no idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics of the movement that that car </v>

3420
02:45:58.591 --> 02:45:59.890
<v Speaker 1>was capable of or possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3421
02:46:00.010 --> 02:46:05.010
<v Speaker 1>So I would drive like a muscle car after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and it had a beautiful feeling to </v>

3422
02:46:05.010 --> 02:46:06.340
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the smell and The sound and the,</v>

3423
02:46:06.590 --> 02:46:10.070
<v Speaker 1>the analog steering and the shifting of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own gears.</v>

3424
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Like if you could get a standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My barracuda was actually an automatic,</v>

3425
02:46:13.311 --> 02:46:14.840
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things I didn't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

3426
02:46:15.500 --> 02:46:17.930
<v Speaker 1>But you built a car and had an automatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>put in.</v>

3427
02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:20.150
<v Speaker 1>It was their idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I let them do everything.</v>

3428
02:46:20.151 --> 02:46:25.151
<v Speaker 1>That's how it all happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your man card suspended or how'd that </v>

3429
02:46:25.151 --> 02:46:25.151
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3430
02:46:25.151 --> 02:46:25.880
<v Speaker 1>it became.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent the money on it for sure,</v>

3431
02:46:25.881 --> 02:46:29.750
<v Speaker 1>but it was all them telling me I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know enough about the muscle car world.</v>

3432
02:46:29.770 --> 02:46:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I was having it built,</v>

3433
02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know why the fuck did they put </v>
<v Speaker 1>it on a mannequin it because the amount </v>

3434
02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:40.451
<v Speaker 1>of power the engine was 700 horsepower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>700 horsepower is an insane amount of </v>

3435
02:46:41.901 --> 02:46:46.901
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's an insane amount of power </v>

3436
02:46:46.901 --> 02:46:49.031
<v Speaker 1>and money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds like a fire breathing </v>

3437
02:46:49.031 --> 02:46:49.031
<v Speaker 1>dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3438
02:46:49.031 --> 02:46:49.850
<v Speaker 1>and he was saying that the clutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just wouldn't handle it.</v>

3439
02:46:49.980 --> 02:46:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just too much fucking a blower on</v>

3440
02:46:52.911 --> 02:46:53.880
<v Speaker 1>the motor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3441
02:46:54.080 --> 02:46:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jesus.</v>

3442
02:46:54.860 --> 02:46:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous car.</v>

3443
02:46:56.840 --> 02:46:59.690
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well actually we went up.</v>

3444
02:46:59.691 --> 02:47:00.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3445
02:47:00.370 --> 02:47:00.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3446
02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I take that back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went up going with electronic fuel </v>

3447
02:47:05.710 --> 02:47:05.710
<v Speaker 1>injection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No blower.</v>

3448
02:47:05.710 --> 02:47:06.620
<v Speaker 1>When you have a 100 horsepower naturally</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspirated.</v>

3449
02:47:06.650 --> 02:47:09.200
<v Speaker 1>When you drive a car like that or like </v>
<v Speaker 1>your porsche.</v>

3450
02:47:09.201 --> 02:47:11.960
<v Speaker 1>I could see because like in la there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>porsches everywhere.</v>

3451
02:47:11.961 --> 02:47:16.961
<v Speaker 1>She can kind of slip under the radar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People may not know exactly what the </v>

3452
02:47:16.961 --> 02:47:18.590
<v Speaker 1>fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like with the muscle car like that,</v>

3453
02:47:18.591 --> 02:47:21.170
<v Speaker 1>that really just stands out when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>drove it,</v>

3454
02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:23.660
<v Speaker 1>was it like a pain in the ass because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to worry about where you park.</v>

3455
02:47:23.661 --> 02:47:25.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like putting your dick on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror and then putting,</v>

3456
02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:31.150
<v Speaker 1>putting a magnifying glass over your </v>
<v Speaker 1>deck and then putting that magnifying </v>

3457
02:47:31.150 --> 02:47:32.590
<v Speaker 1>glass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connecting it to a,</v>

3458
02:47:32.591 --> 02:47:37.591
<v Speaker 1>like a gigantic speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>projector screens from high school.</v>

3459
02:47:39.860 --> 02:47:41.720
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

3460
02:47:42.050 --> 02:47:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed kind of uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3461
02:47:44.841 --> 02:47:49.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed the people that were cool </v>

3462
02:47:49.841 --> 02:47:51.941
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did not enjoy the people that </v>

3463
02:47:51.941 --> 02:47:52.670
<v Speaker 1>weren't cool about the best thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody ever said is I was at sunset and</v>

3464
02:47:52.671 --> 02:47:54.860
<v Speaker 1>leaving the comedy store and that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>parked at a.</v>

3465
02:47:54.861 --> 02:47:59.861
<v Speaker 1>There was like a red light and some guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked across the street and the dude </v>

3466
02:47:59.861 --> 02:48:00.890
<v Speaker 1>was a black dude of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they just have a way with words.</v>

3467
02:48:01.430 --> 02:48:02.570
<v Speaker 1>He looked at my car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

3468
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:04.790
<v Speaker 1>god damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm talking about.</v>

3469
02:48:05.860 --> 02:48:08.330
<v Speaker 1>He started pointing me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm talking about.</v>

3470
02:48:08.331 --> 02:48:10.430
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a motherfucking call.</v>

3471
02:48:10.940 --> 02:48:13.630
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he walked across the street and he's</v>

3472
02:48:13.640 --> 02:48:14.090
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

3473
02:48:14.091 --> 02:48:14.940
<v Speaker 1>damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>two more times.</v>

3474
02:48:16.110 --> 02:48:17.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god damn,</v>

3475
02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:22.130
<v Speaker 1>that was almost worth having that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit almost killed you in the wheel,</v>

3476
02:48:22.131 --> 02:48:22.880
<v Speaker 1>fall off the wheel.</v>

3477
02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Fell off was a real issue and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>real issue was the fact that I </v>

3478
02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:31.751
<v Speaker 1>understood from reading road and track </v>
<v Speaker 1>and motor trend and then online blogs.</v>

3479
02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:37.670
<v Speaker 1>I started understanding automotive </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology because before I came into it</v>

3480
02:48:37.671 --> 02:48:41.250
<v Speaker 1>as a comedian that stumbled upon some </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and the oh,</v>

3481
02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:43.850
<v Speaker 1>that'd be pretty to drive drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you just go,</v>

3482
02:48:43.851 --> 02:48:48.290
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized that I appreciated a</v>

3483
02:48:48.291 --> 02:48:53.291
<v Speaker 1>car that actually worked as much or more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than I appreciated a car.</v>

3484
02:48:53.511 --> 02:48:58.511
<v Speaker 1>That was beautiful looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that why you like the porsche robot </v>

3485
02:48:58.511 --> 02:48:58.550
<v Speaker 1>for our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3486
02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:03.720
<v Speaker 1>You know why I like it because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel to it that it's like I know they're</v>

3487
02:49:03.721 --> 02:49:05.960
<v Speaker 1>not as good looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I see a ferrari,</v>

3488
02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:08.250
<v Speaker 1>a ferrari four or five,</v>

3489
02:49:08.250 --> 02:49:13.250
<v Speaker 2>eight italia is a bound as beautiful as </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone can engineer.</v>

3490
02:49:14.630 --> 02:49:19.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might be less beautiful 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years from now because they figured out </v>

3491
02:49:19.630 --> 02:49:23.781
<v Speaker 2>a new shape or it might be less </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful because there's a new </v>

3492
02:49:23.781 --> 02:49:24.450
<v Speaker 2>aesthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to me that's like as.</v>

3493
02:49:24.930 --> 02:49:28.360
<v Speaker 2>But who is this car for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is if that's a four or five,</v>

3494
02:49:28.361 --> 02:49:30.420
<v Speaker 2>eight italian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look at that fucking thing.</v>

3495
02:49:30.421 --> 02:49:35.421
<v Speaker 2>That thing is mid engine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic italian engineering and </v>

3496
02:49:35.421 --> 02:49:40.101
<v Speaker 2>design.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those slits you see those with the </v>

3497
02:49:40.101 --> 02:49:43.251
<v Speaker 2>hood reaches the bumper and there's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of triangular opening that's for </v>

3498
02:49:43.251 --> 02:49:47.781
<v Speaker 2>downforce and cooling and the vents </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath the front bumper off or </v>

3499
02:49:47.781 --> 02:49:52.460
<v Speaker 2>downforce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a fucking marvel of </v>

3500
02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:52.460
<v Speaker 2>engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus the</v>

3501
02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:53.850
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the racing history of the f one,</v>

3502
02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:56.260
<v Speaker 2>nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

3503
02:49:57.220 --> 02:50:02.220
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that shit is for other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where I feel like a bitch.</v>

3504
02:50:02.770 --> 02:50:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I personally feel like a bitch when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing things for other people.</v>

3505
02:50:05.890 --> 02:50:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a balance between other people </v>

3506
02:50:10.890 --> 02:50:13.291
<v Speaker 2>and myself and I feel like that balance </v>
<v Speaker 2>is almost like a gritty old muscle car </v>

3507
02:50:14.290 --> 02:50:19.290
<v Speaker 2>or a 73,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 rs that you haven't really</v>

3508
02:50:20.441 --> 02:50:23.860
<v Speaker 2>rsr that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't fucking done anything to the</v>

3509
02:50:23.861 --> 02:50:26.770
<v Speaker 2>paint five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got chips around your wheel.</v>

3510
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:30.420
<v Speaker 2>Wells age developed some patina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a few nicks in your hoods,</v>

3511
02:50:30.421 --> 02:50:34.270
<v Speaker 2>you know queen shit going on some diva </v>
<v Speaker 2>queen shit.</v>

3512
02:50:34.271 --> 02:50:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Some steve mcqueen shit for real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm talking about man.</v>

3513
02:50:38.081 --> 02:50:40.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like we've gone to this manicured </v>
<v Speaker 2>nail era,</v>

3514
02:50:41.080 --> 02:50:42.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you wearing a wig,</v>

3515
02:50:42.581 --> 02:50:43.960
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3516
02:50:43.961 --> 02:50:47.020
<v Speaker 2>this is some bullshit going on where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are there,</v>

3517
02:50:47.021 --> 02:50:52.021
<v Speaker 2>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gravitating towards the non </v>

3518
02:50:52.021 --> 02:50:54.541
<v Speaker 2>manly way and that non manly way is </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling them there because of scarcity </v>

3519
02:50:54.541 --> 02:50:59.401
<v Speaker 2>and because it's difficult to acquire </v>

02:52:34.211 --> 02:52:39.211
<v Speaker 2>a gig where he would do five new minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>of standup every week and I thought </v>

3556
02:52:39.211 --> 02:52:39.640
<v Speaker 2>about doing that,</v>

3558
02:52:41.621 --> 02:52:43.630

<v Speaker 2>It could be horrible,</v>

3559
02:52:43.990 --> 02:52:48.990
<v Speaker 2>but marmel had the balls to do that </v>
